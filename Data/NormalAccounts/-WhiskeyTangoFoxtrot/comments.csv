0,"Doctor here - this is definitely a picture after reconstruction of Fournier Gangrene - NSFW https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fournier_gangrene  After resection of the soft tissue of the perineum, including the scrotal tissue, the testicles can retract above the penile shaft prior to having a wound that can accept a skin graft.   Somebody just didn't switch them back prior to grafting.

Edit:  NSFW - Here is a pic of twig &amp; berries mid-debridement - http://i.imgur.com/0uN4ruG.png",2016-06-04 03:06:45+00:00,d3vcax3,1,t3_4m78g4,134205,WTF

That's a 17lb turkey in the second pic.  3rd pic is 2 pork butts, a rack of ribs, and assorted sausage.  4th pic is a 31lb suckling pig, split and stacked.  You can see the other half under the top half.",2016-02-09 04:00:34+00:00,czt2ttb,5,t1_czt0w2d,3269,sousvide
2,"I tend to use the Big Bad Beef Rub off of amazingribs.com:  http://amazingribs.com/recipes/rubs_pastes_marinades_and_brines/big_bad_beef_rub.html  

It is a heavily black pepper based rub, so it really gives the brisket a good amount of heat to it and with the mesquite smoke it mixes quite well.  My neighbor's daughter said ""It tastes like I'm eating a campfire.  I love it.""",2016-02-09 03:37:48+00:00,czt20zn,4,t1_czszm1i,3936,sousvide
3,Sliced hot and still had good structure.  What temp are you doing for 48 hours?,2016-02-08 23:22:45+00:00,czssmnl,2,t1_czsqpc7,3615,sousvide
4,"Semi-cold smoke.  I have a Komodo Kamado, so started the lump and once it was mostly started I added the wood.  The cooker was still reading around 70F up top when I put the brisket on to smoke.  Over the course of the hour it went up to about 180F.  I used a Thermapen to check the meat when I took it off and the interior was still only 70F.",2016-02-08 23:12:24+00:00,czss9jj,3,t1_czsmbwg,9165,sousvide
5,"Since mesquite can sometimes be too much smoke, I thought 1 hour would be good and it was.  High level of smoke throughout without overpowering the meat or the rub.  If I were using hickory, pecan, etc., I may do 2 hours.",2016-02-08 23:09:19+00:00,czss5w1,2,t1_czsaxzk,25068,sousvide
6,Brisket smoked over mesquite for 1 hour then sous vide at 133f for 48 hours. Seared on cast iron and with a Searzall. Delicious. ,2016-02-08 14:42:18+00:00,czs7tco,1,t3_44r63u,41,sousvide
7,I would argue that a Sauvignon blanc or vernaccia would pair well with beef tartare or carpaccio. ,2016-02-02 18:41:47+00:00,czl9jg4,3,t1_czl0cf9,13711,AskReddit
8,134F for 48 hours. Ziplock bag is fine. Sear on grill or with torch. Use juices from the bag to make a gravy. Done. ,2015-12-22 22:34:18+00:00,cy8aggs,1,t3_3xuvki,17679,sousvide
