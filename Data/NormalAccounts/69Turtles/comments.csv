6,"Your audio needs to be louder, I know your audio isnt great and kinda staticy but making it so we cant really hear you doesn't make it any better, and try to be less informative like when I do and intro or have to explain something my rule of thumb is keep it as short as possible. Just be a bit louder and more energetic cause since you dont do facecam you need to express all emotions through your voice.

Hope you grow and do great.

With Love

7,"For starters your audio should be louder then the games audio, because you started to get quiet but the game was loud so I couldn't understand you. Also a little editing can do a lot, there was a part where you had to backtrack and you said nothing and walked back and was looking around saying nothing, you can just cut that out after saying I have to backtrack and then cut back in a bit before you find it. Also as for personality it comes with practice cause when I first started it was super awkward sitting alone in a room playing a game talking to basically yourself, but as time goes on you will get used to it and open up more, just keep going and I am sure you will get it.

With Love

8,Sorry about that I currently use OBS for video and audacity for audio but something is wrong with my audacity so when I put it into movie maker it shows audio levels in the wrong area so there maybe no sound but show audio levels and vice versa,2016-08-12 03:22:19+00:00,d6e34e8,2,t1_d6dp4v1,26017,LetsPlayCritiques

11,"The music was a bit off, why was it dramatic music when you are doing something so light heart'd and fun? Other then that Yeah the framerate at some points war laggy and the the commentary was a bit to informative like, well I need to cut trees so i will cut trees, I have cut trees. You need to be more charismatic and fun, most people who watch minecraft are kids so just try to be charismatic, nothing over the top but just have fun with it.",2016-07-31 18:16:23+00:00,d5yk57c,1,t3_4vgwux,20231,LetsPlayCritiques
12,side note I am looking into the synching issue more and it is actually like maybe a couple miliseconds off and I have never noticed this till now but my mouth moves weird when I talk,2016-07-29 17:33:54+00:00,d5w584i,3,t1_d5w4qo3,617,LetsPlayCritiques
13,"Thanks for the feedback and I am seeing it too, while editing it looked fine but I do see a slight gap between video and audio, thanks for pointing that out so I can make sure it never happens again. And I will sit up straight from now on, I normally slouch when I play games, but then again I normally never record myself playing. Thanks for the advice.

Thanks

14,"Thanks for the advice I just added an outro so it doesnt just cut off and I guess I should do the same for the intro as well. Thanks for the advice I'm glad you liked it, it meabs a lot to me and I will fix this problem. :)",2016-07-19 20:49:31+00:00,d5inp43,2,t1_d5ijs7i,5011,LetsPlayCritiques
15,"I will fix it, I am working with new recording software so I was testing it out and recorded three episodes and I re-watched it and was like hey that's pretty good and made it into a series but I will fix it. Thanks for saying this, cause its a small thing that might annoy some and go unnoticed by me.",2016-07-16 07:27:39+00:00,d5ec7gt,2,t1_d5e12z7,24644,LetsPlayCritiques
16,"I really appreciate the critique, I do struggle with the mic and audio cause I am no audio wizard but I will see what I can do, and I do apologize for being so vulgar I am still a bit new to this so I sometimes get scared and think hey dirty is funny lets yell dirty words . This really boosts my confidence and I cant express the gratitude to you and everyone who commented cause I haven't gotten any critiques or comments and I feel I am doing something wrong so this helps a lot. Also about the description I dont mean to pat myself on the back its just I dont think anyone ever reads it so sometimes I just write whatever. I got a good laugh out of that and will go back to writing real descriptions.",2016-07-16 07:25:13+00:00,d5ec5w1,2,t1_d5dpbte,42794,LetsPlayCritiques
17,Thanks for that because I have been battling with this for a while. I wanted people to be able to hear the game and me but I felt I just keep raising the audio of the game then me then the game until it was a shouting match and I had no consistency between audio levels in my videos. I thank you for the critique cause I now know I should focus on voice rather then the games background music,2016-07-16 07:20:17+00:00,d5ec2tb,2,t1_d5dmw3m,45726,LetsPlayCritiques
