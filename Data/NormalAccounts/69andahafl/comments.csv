32,"I'm inclined to agree with you honestly, they look much more like rat poison blocks than a kiln supports.

Rat poison seems to have a much smaller hole in the middle, and consistently too.

[Example 1.](http://www.pestcontrolsupplies.co.uk/Img/Dyn/Cache/Products/3542-280813092920332176146.jpg)

[Example 2.](http://www.jyj-machinery.com/Uploads/145733604056dd12b8cbdd4.jpg)

Now I am aware that these block's don't look like the OP's, but these are just from a basic google image search. The method of extrusion may vary during the time period, or country. 

Kiln posts as you pointed out have a much larger hole in the center.

[Example 1.](http://www.clay-king.com/images/kilnposts.jpg)

[Example 2.](http://www.slumpys.com/Kiln-Furniture_2.jpg)

There is also the very imporant bit of context everyone is ignoring from the post,

""There was a 5-gallon bucket of these things found in the backyard of the house we bought this year. Lots of partial pieces of these were found on the ground near a fence/gate and a lilac bush.""

Why would kiln supports be left outside, under a lilac bush, or near a fence/gate. These are prime areas for rats to get in, so it would make sense that there would be poison left there. In OP's picture the blocks also contain various grain colours (see example 2 of rat poison), something which wouldn't be present in a kiln support, but is found in a lot of rat poisons. 

There is also waterproof bait blocks, such as [this](http://www.homebase.co.uk/en/homebaseuk/mouse-and-rat-weatherproof-bait-blocks---12-195258), which can be left outside without melting. The blocks are also very tough, as rodents like to gnaw on stuff, and combined with their long time outdoors, exposed the elements they have probably gotten much  harder allowing for chipping.",2016-11-02 01:35:54+00:00,d9hr30i,4.0,t1_d9gygd6,34271.0,whatisthisthing

241,"From what I've read, the main purpose of the Sea Jet was to test the new waterjet propulsion along with improved stealth, not specifically the improved tumblehome design.

I'm not sure that the tumblehome design was every truly in question as the engineers who design it wouldn't make something that couldn't float, and they would have plenty of simulation to ensure that a practical model of the design would work.  You also have to understand that the Sea Jet is actually a fairly small ship at only 133 ft. The USS Zumwalt is 600 ft, and uses the same hull design. I'm not sure that the performance of Sea Jet on the open sea would have been an accurate representation of a full loaded battleship on the sea.

It's just a testbed for various technologies most of which are used on Zumwalt-Class Destroyers, such as the DDG-1000 which has been gracing the front page.

Another note worthy feature tested on this ship was the underwater discharge water jet or AWJ-21 developed by Rolls-Royce Naval Marine. The main draw to this technology is it's increased propulsive efficient while also maintaining a smaller acoustic signature and improving maneuverability over past destroyer class vessels.

It's based out of the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Devision, Acoustic Research Detachment in Bayview, Idaho. It has been in service in Decemenber of 2005, and it only 41 (133 ft) meters long.",2016-03-29 04:34:07+00:00,d1hbeaq,1.0,t3_4cdwtq,908.0,WarshipPorn

On LLJK, if you need to disarm someone quicky there's a couple of good ways to do it:

1. Throw a basket ball at someone, if they have something in their active hand you'll bean them with it, casuing them to drop what they have and be stunned for a second or two.

2. If you have access to a chair, turn grab intent on and make like you're going to buckle yourself in. This will cause you to stand up on the chair at which point you can use the *flip emote (or ctrl + r) to flip off the chair and into the person after you. This will cause them to drop what they have which you can fight over once you get back up! (if you get good at this you can do it really quickly)

344,"While not necessarily ""cyberpunk"" to a key, the bridge trilogy, at least from what I gather, gives insight into the slow evolution of the cyberpunk genera. Having just finished Virtual Light, I and being interested as to what the meaning of the story is, I found the general conscious to be about the dangers of emerging technology, something which Gibson seems to favor in his writings. In Neuromaner there's the release of AIs, and in Virtual Light we seem to get a glimpse into the evolution of the world with technology in the Sunflower Corporation. While not ""dangerous"" per say, it certainly shows how Gibson's cyberpunk future evolved from our world today. Although I don't want to get very deep into the themes in Virtual Light, I think Skinner is one of the more interesting characters in the novel, seeming to represent the past and the way in which the people on the bridge attempt to avoid becoming too ""technologically advanced"". We see this a lot with Skinner's old tools and knickknacks, the haphazard construction of the Bridge houses, and the cart-maker, how he favors old heavy materials over the new Japanese paper bikes. Anyways, just some interesting things I noticed or read about.

Generally these cartridges are found inside the crate the with the RCD, but you can also buy/make more if you need it. There's two RCDs on the station, one in the EVA and the other in the chief engineer's office. To change the mode, you simply click on the RCD when it's in your active hand. There's 3 modes, construct, deconstruct, and doors. You want the deconstruct mode, and once it's active you just click the tile and wait a second or two, and it'll be gone.

Alternatively, you can enlist the help of a construction cyborg, which has an RCD only limited by it's battery life, not by compressed matter cartridges.

376,"[Here's a link to a diagram of what we're talking about.](https://www.uky.edu/KGS/coal/images/coal_rank_brown_black_text_med.jpg)
Please don't base your analysis on this, but rather look at it and try to understand what it's talking about. P&amp;T are very basic concepts of geology, and rather than give you the answer, we're trying to get you to figure it out with some little pushes.

If you are having trouble understanding the concepts of how P&amp;T increase and decrease, and the relationship between them, go talk with your teacher/professor. They'll be more than happy and better equipped to help you understand it.

[Here's another example that shows the relationship a bit better.](http://www.geol.umd.edu/~jmerck/geol100/images/15/meta.grade.gif) What you want to focus on is the idea that as we increase our depth, on the right hand side, the pressure also increases on the left. Along with this though, we also see that temperature also  increases, so in total we see what as we go deeper into the earth, the pressure and temperature increase. Also, ignore the areas of metamorphism and magmatism for now, you're looking in the ""Realm of Diagenesis"" right near the start of the arrow. Diagenesis meaning the transformation of sediments into sedimentary rock, which is the basic idea of coal.

Now, this is all basic information but it should give you a bit of a basis to think further about your topic. You're going to want to ask yourself how did the pressure increase, what caused an increase in depth? As I said before though, if you don't get P&amp;T you're not going to make much progress in your paper, you're going to want to go talk to your teacher or professor and as for their help explaining. If you don't want to do it during class, see about office hours or setting up a private meeting. It's like trying to do calculus without understanding addition and subtraction. Don't be afraid if you think it's a silly question, it's better to get it and feel a little silly for asking than to not getting it at all.",2015-11-02 23:05:02+00:00,cwm6ib2,17.0,t1_cwlyigo,11258.0,geology

416,"Well, you might have some difficulty finding the specific part you are looking for. What I can tell you now, is that that part is from the ink supply system, which I assume you already know. The pink gasket itself presents some more difficulty in identifying what part it is. I believe it's called a print head, but that could also be the name of the actual in cartridge.

There is some good news though, if the leak is coming from the threaded connection between the gasket and the 90 degree bend portion, those parts are fairly easy to find. (mind you, most of them need to be bought in bulk) [Here's an example.](http://www.udprinter.com/Ink-Supply-System/Ink-Connector/)

The bad news is, if it's the gasket you may need to take it out of another printer of the same make. The only thing I could find like it online was called a ""micro tube connector"" by Reepure, as seen [here](http://reepure.com/productShow.asp?ArticleID=1).

Your best bet is to probably contact 3D Systems, who took over ZCorp, and see if they still stock a part like that. Another good option would be to contact HP, and ask them if they stock parts like those, or know where to get something like it.

448,"Well, for LLJK (Gibbed):

Population: Depends on the time of day really, during peak times there can be 40 to maybe 60 on a good day. During off times, there can be 20 or less, but still enough people so that the station doesn't feel completely abandoned. Note these are for LLJK #4, as the other servers are usually empty, or near empty (but still fun).

RP Level: LLJK is low to no RP in my opinion. It doesn't really take away from your over all experience, as long as you go in knowing that it's a bit more fast paced than a round on a high or mid RP server. If you wanna nerd out about a job with a staff assistant you can, and there's no restraints on what you can and cannot do as a defined job (which is really nice).

Meta BS: Assuming you mean drama, there's little to none on LLJK which is nice. Yes, there's players that aren't too popular, but they're few and far between. All the regular admins are very competent in how they conduct themselves over adminhelp, and rarely ever make a ""wrong call"" on banning someone. If you have an issue, and want to talk about it, generally the admins are more than happy to, but the key going in is to know that the admin's call is right, and to be RESPECTFUL to them. If you aren't, you'll get what's coming to ya. Generally the ban appeal forums are very well handled, but there are very well defined rules that have to be followed lest you incur the wrath of the admin team. For player meta BS, again there's little to none. Yes, there are ""popular"" (that sounds really dumb) players who get along with each other, but there really isn't the ""cliques"" you find on other mid-high RP severs. If someone wants to get involved usually people are more than happy to explain it to them, and if that fails there's always mentor help. Generally, everyone gets along handsomely!
