These missions were:

Ophelia - Uranus - Survival, at 15 min mark one (should) spawn, but didn't. Stayed until the 25 min mark with nothing.

Titan - Saturn - Survival, at 20 min mark one (should) spawn, but again didn't.

The strange part of this is, on a nightmare survival earlier today on Saturn one spawned at the 8 or so minute mark (2 mins to evac). Has anyone else run into this difficulty? I'm not sure it's entirely RNG, as I have had consistent success with these methods in the past so maybe something has changed?

The other one I really enjoyed was [""Native Dreams""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPOMdVoMtuA).

I see wikipedia has them listed under psychedelic rock, but I've always liked their lyrics mainly, as they revolve around folk-lore like elements I find. For example the lyrics of Spirit Modules has always been what brought me back.

Does anyone have any recommendations? I'm kind of a 1-song kind of guy in that I don't really judge artists by their albums but I more just enjoy a few of their songs. I don't really have a preference for instruments, but I guess if I had to choose it would be more classical ones for songs like these over electric.",ifyoulikeblank,"[IIL] Rose Windows, [WEWIL]?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ifyoulikeblank/comments/542py7/iil_rose_windows_wewil/

The process involved placing circular ""barriers"" onto a base which is an abrasive, and then the parts go inside of the barriers. The base is turned on and rotates, which causes the parts inside the barriers to also rotate, which sands down the parts. I'm not 100% as to whether or not a weight is placed on top of the parts, but I believe they are usually uncovered.

Usually multiple ""barriers"" are placed onto a single base, and they are all sanded/polished at the same time.",tipofmytongue,[TOMT] [WORD] [INDUSTRIAL] - A Specific Sanding Process,http://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/3d2krj/tomt_word_industrial_a_specific_sanding_process/
