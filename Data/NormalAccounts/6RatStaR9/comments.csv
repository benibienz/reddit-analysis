0,"I dont know if it is considered a spoiler , I think so , but the 3rd act hinges on the audience not really knowing how close White`s mom is to her death and that sudden feeling of unrealization when a loved one passes which can overwhelm us if it happens , then the responsibility to act .But since James has gathered a positive sense of responsibility over the months and has started acting with a greater  sense of purpose than himself and as the movies time cards indicate - there are these phases they go through ; getting worse , getting better , she having weird symptoms that comes and goes away , it really shattered his world.
I think two scenes almost perfectly describes that unreal feeling when you know as a person this is the end,both as the care taker and the sufferer.I think what happened in that scene confused me and left me overwhelmed.I actually dont know what happened , but it seemed very real.",2016-07-14 10:41:22+00:00,d5bs8w8,2.0,t1_d5af71z,85503.0,TrueFilm
1,"The ending confused me and shocked me and left me asking what did happen.I still dont know. I probably felt like the character , I had a lump in my throat like I think a lot of people will have if they were in that situation.
I remember I lit up a cigarette at the end of the film and like with The end of the tour stood in my kitchen , nodded my head and said to myself ""Damn that was a really good and honest film.""
I can relate with this film and I know I will likely be in a similar situation later in my own life.My own mother recently had to take care of both my grandpa and grandma up til their own passing, and I realized sometimes the important lessons you learn in life are in the hardest times.
The strong acting in this movie really supports the story.I would agree with your comparison to those two films.

It is a very uncomfortable watch at times, in your face and often very honest in its morbid and hopeful depiction of life then death and ho people come to terms with it.
It didntfeel like a conventional  western drama  and that is a very good thing.",2016-07-13 10:59:57+00:00,d5af9vo,1.0,t3_4slvt3,13302.0,TrueFilm
2,"I liked TFA but at the expense of switching my brain off.I liked it for different reasons than most people did.I like most off JJ s movies like that and usually his film dont get any better after repeated views.Some part do but , it does not last long.
That being said I dont think the part that bugs me is that she is a Mary-sue or the film moves from beat to scene as it does, nor as some call the plot and story, too safe or unoriginal. JJ has his creative moments but like many other director who have just as much talent if not more they seem to event their own thing on film atleast.
The problem with TFA that is the most grounded  in its foundation which effects everything else, is that things just arent motivated well or at all , even if it is again a heros Journey.Instead of good motivation for some thing to happen , silly explanations are giving in order for another beat or scene to exist.i.e the Falcon , mask breathing smoke etc etc.
But how can story-tellers who cant motivate good action get the audience interested or on the side of their characters that is based on one of their favorite film universes?
One of the Cheapist-tricks in my opinion. Let me compare the force awakens with Fury road and explain how I see good motivated action , narrative between characters and how to own acknowledgement from another.Here are the Four pillars of what not to do.

1.Make the classic characters compliment the new without them really deserving so much credit : There are many examples of one character compliment another even if the other character cannot hear the compliment.This communicates to the audience that a characters is deserving of whatever they are doing.Han liking Finn and Rye. Finn in awe of Poe s areal fighting skills.Yes Finn I can see Poe is good.I`m watching the movie thank you.
Poe gives Finn his Jacket Aaaaaahhwww !!?? They buds now. Which lead to number 2.
 
2.Over-play the narrative on the action from one actor to another , not character to character which should be  motivated in the narrative .
Or when it suits the plot underplay a character to another so that distinction can be made even if unmotivated.Many examples in the film.
This goes hand in hand with 3.

3. Have a pseudo-strong hero repeat some strong things about themselves.Stop holding my hand , I don`t use guns etc boring expository stuff.

4. Be consisted about a characters growth even if a character is conflicted about themselves : Suddenly a small group blows up an Empire why should I care.Suddenly they good guys rise up and will by default over-come the bad guys ,little struggle unless the script needs unmotivated tension.

I can go on...

Okay these points are subjective and I can overlook them and still enjoy this film and it is probably wrong to compare it to Mad Max Fury Road , but here just a few reasons using some similar things to TFA Fury Roads dialogue (the little there are but motivated ) , narrative and character motivations , Action , world building , themes etc will be remembered much longer. It runs like a well oiled motivated machine.

Max showing thumbs up to Angharad moments before ...
""Thats my Jacket "" Punching Nux and taking his jacket.  I know they have a different relationship than traitor Finn and Poe but this is just more interesting when considering a traitors character arc.
Nux having a great song theme and character arc that is motivated by the influence of other characters and the rejections of certain beliefs which are part of the world-building and themes in the narrative,which goes hand in hand with just how much the action is motivated yet the dialogue under-plays this action.Something happens because of something else and something is said because of something that is happening.

For example .Morsaw asks that his brother, and the audience witness him in a stunning action bit ,while still adhering to the the characters belief in this death-cult religion and yet still being able to deliver a sense of duality within the themes with small but motivated dialogue.
Witness me !  Mediocre (underplay the action)Yet the audience dont think that , we think it is damn awesome and juxtoposed.Both these pieces of dialogue from two different characters is motivated by the characters personal or collective views and their action. The film asks as not to witness and merely acknowledge a character nor an actions scene because of great visuals (Did you see that ?) but to be suspended in disbelief of what we are seeing.

How about Max giving a gun to Furiosa and not a single word is spoken (I dont need a gun, eeew !)
How about we never getting to see Joe s face because a relative theme is hinged on it being hidden by the mask.By all means take the mask off Ren just don`t dont suddenly turn all illogical , I know you are conflicted but seriously.
Ask yourself ; How imperfect and flawed are both the villains and heroes in Fury Road and how do they problem solve a situations , trying to tip the balance in their own favor , what motivates that and is still entertaining ? Then asks yourself what is it that motivated the beats the scenes and the entire journey of the Force awakens ? Does it only entertain ? Is the only real motivation perhaps merely a droid with a usb stick and everything else is spectacle and entertainment.
In Fury Road character tag along for their own reasons.
In the Force awakens everyone just tags along because of reasons.

8,"Well damn  fireflyfanboy1891 you said many things I felt similar about in a creative article and I can really buy into this.Great read.

I think these movies and even Fury road spark so many plausible and applicable theories of society because they are well written and plausible stories of events and worlds that has and most-likely can happen in the future.

I always felt after re-watching these films and having the pleasure of witnessing Fury Road a few to many times - not enough that after the final collapse of global society and infrastructure that the roads in gas stations slowly disappear in these films as Max said ""as the world fell , each in our own way was broken. It was hard to know who was more crazy, me or everyone else "" 

I think after this events of collapse people split up and formed much smaller tribes of smaller control ,biker gangs as in the first movie.Slowly battles were lost for the roads but even these smaller communities cannot control the battle against the ever growing threat of the aftermath of warfare and the toll nature will have on infrastructures.We also see less houses.It felt like a low budget film. 

In road warrior commodities became even more scarce and we see even fewer roads and gas stations.
Now an old gasoline supply is being fortified and these ""tribes"" as you speak of still continue to fight ,but only because the ""prophecy"" of hard times has not yet been fully fulfilled. (I don`t mean that in a biblical sense) but their is a lot of strong evidence that Max resembles a wondering prophet like warrior.

What I enjoy about Fury Road is how roads after Thunderdomes more Bybalonian/Rome-esque society , comes back into play.We see roads ,settlements  , kingdoms , 1800 Black Powder guns etc.We See Buzzard tribes and often the Vehicles resemble beasts of fantasy.
But these road are of the new world , the ones of tar and cements are long gone.The ones of structure and rules are long gone.
In this world with made up roads which belong to Immortan Joe is off madness and control.One could hardly call some of the terrain even roads as those seem to be uncharted territory. 
The further we progress after the point of collapse the more bizarre things become , props and cultures mixed in from the old world and with the expanding new.
Immortan Joe has united these tribes and people into his Kingdom with those of his brothers.No more Gas stations are needed in this world and new roads are everywhere or made where ever (a world of madness and survival outside the Kingdom).
One of the reason I love Nux taking off his stearing well and pointing it in the air for a majestic mid-frame shot is that it represent the roadlessness and the maniacal zealot mindset they have.As if he is some young tribal warrior riding a beast and pointing some tribal prop in the air.

How long did it take Immortan Joe to build his Citadel ?Or did he find it ,was it passed down to him?
We see cranes and wind turbines and in one shot it reminded me of Metropolis.We can assume 80 or 500 years who knows? I can assume that Immortan Joe is a great but tyranical leader in his methods.He know of the old world but survives in the new, he subjugates those who cannot survive without transport.But how does he rule them,why care for them ? I often felt that he wanted to rebuild society but in his own view.He believes in infrastructure and economy etc but by his terms.I often felt that the reason he wanted to rebuild society as it once was with a healthy line-age is not for the idea or memory of how he once remembered this world but from stories he read or heard of the immence power of these societies.He realized that this was a working world that thrived in the past.Off course viewing the film like this we need to ignore Max as a once Cop who was there when the world fell,then again Max is a campfire story character and as I view a prophet of sorts.

One of the Vuvalini of many mothers talk of satellites and TV shows and I time when nobody needed to snap anyone and a green place.
Did she experience it herself or are these tales her own mother told her as her mothers mother etc...? 
All we know is that there is progression made in time over these films in the structure of societies after the collapse there of.
And how Fury Road resembled its society , its believes its treatment of people and even if grasp on old traditions,stories ,facts , mechanical and  medical skill (the mix of the ancient , the recent past and the new ) etc etc is some damn fine world building.",2016-01-14 11:14:49+00:00,cyxsbxr,1.0,t3_40vlzc,30560.0,TrueFilm

That is quite possibly the reason .The water jug might as well not imply a device or method of torture but instead a duration.What I mean is the water might be for Del Toro and Brolin`s own consumption alluring that they will take there time and and make it slow.But some people on here say they were hasty.Perhaps torture was induced by cutting and the water becomes a cleaning agent.

I believe a very strong case can be made in Lilya-4-ever [that the main protagonist is dreaming](/spoiler) 
I just thought that was rather interesting how it reminded me about this film.
When he was laying with his bloody head in the water I felt that he is not dead and I expected the girl to help him even if it is not shown.If he is dead how would he dream and I don`t feel this is motivated.As his head was in the water I actually expected a revenge scene to follow , perhaps my expectations have been subverted.
I also expected him to have a gun.I thought to myself it would be a really horrible and great scene if he assassinated his assailants  whom are all deaf.The method he used is fitting.

I don`t think I understood any other allegorical meanings in the film ,social-commentary or metaphors.
I only understood love , hate ,crime ,exploiting people and revenge and how anyone is capable of these things on a very basic level.

13,"I think a distinction should be made between unnecessary exposition and motivated exposition regardless if it is shown visually or narratively explained and regardless if it is few or frequent or loads to take in.It shouldnt matter as long as it motivates the structure and the means to understand the plot correctly in context of the film,otherwise it will feel out of place. 
World Building is usually a key component and  conditioner to believable exposition.

Nicholas Winding Refn can withhold little information from the audience and make a film really good or at least interesting as in case of Valhalla Rising, Only god Forgives and Drive or in the case of Bronson give us a lot of narrative  and yet no psychological explanation into the mind of Charlie.
Pixar can do show no tell Wall-E or give us lots of backstory and explanations but they all feel natural as in Incredibles or Ratatouille.
Inside Out comes out of the gates with everything the viewer needs to know at that moment because it fits the existentialism so well as we hear Joy narrate but we never see her lips move(is it in her mind?)The amount of information is trimmed to just what we need to know at that moment without much action.
Toy story thrusts as directly into the world with little explanation as to how and why but we still understand what is going on.
Horror on the other hand relies on the exact information we need to get but few films get this right imo.

Silent movies and even German Expressionism are great to discuss in context of information.Touch of evil is an oldie but it is a great example.
The Same can be said for Paul Thomas Anderson(Boogie Nights There will be blood) ,David Lynch , David Cronenberg (I think Mind-Screwers are essential in getting the balance of information needed right.)Coen Bros,Sydney Lumet ,Fincher and really any competent film maker that knows when and when not is something too much.

Some of the very best can bee seen in Foreign cinema (Kurosawa , Bergman ...)or Kubrick and Hitchcock , not so much oldies.They tend to withhold and give away in spades.Comedies and Noir can with great effect with hold or give information at the correct times.
One of my favorite uses of exposition in film is in Come and See(aptly named).
We get withhold information more than 6 times then at the very end it all comes together to overwhelm the viewer and Florya. Russian film makers in general know the rules ,potential and limitations of exposition , montage and edit ; Battleship Potemkin ,Stalker.

Blade Runner ,Dark City ,Koyaanisqatsi, Under the Skin , ExstenZe , Star Wars, Mad Max FR ,Snowpiercer , Jurassic park, edge of tomorrow ,china town , The matrix ,Terminator , Ghost in the shell https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXTnl1FVFBw - NERDWRITER , 
 Children of men https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-woNlmVcdjc

All these films have the correct amount of exposition, fashioned in a manner required for there stories to work and they all have great world building ,because of that.What I mean the world is already there but explanation never distracts or demeans from that which already exist.
Good exposition and Good world building  compliment each other.

14,"Realist film criticism vs unrealistic (dare I say elitist) and biased ""opinions"".
The fervor of love for the new star wars might actually become in itself as strong as certain worldviews ,considering that how much of an impact the franchise already has for some.
But if something is over-hyped it does`t mean it is bad ,just it is over-hyped.I think Jeremy Jahns said that ,I`m speaking under correction.

I have a film friend who isn`t just hyped up for this film.I mean I myself am pretty stoked for new Star Wars.
But countless times on social media, he admitted, perhaps unknowingly that he is completely biased towards the greatness of JJ Abrams and the future of Star Wars franchise.Not only confident it will succeed ,but his mind is completely made up.
In fact JJ Abrams and Star Wars are among his favorite things.

No matter the critical outcome of the film come December , in his mind it is the best film of the decade.
I actually explained to him about the massive input many people have on this film and the risks being taking regarding external marketing and other products like Star Wars Land , games etc.Even explained to him that JJ Abrams was not the first choice for Director and Disney is controlling perhaps alot of what goes into this film ,I don`t know.
I myself am really psyched for this film, but it seems the film will succeed in many fans hearts and minds even if it does fail , which  I think is slim but still ,it will succeed if it fail if only judged by the effort of everyone involved in the making of it.

There is problem in viewing films like this,you cant learn anything critical about the film if your opinion is already absolute.
But the #1 Reason my friend  want it to succeed,but will undoubtedly in his own mind grant it the best film of the year as he already proclaimed , is because I loved Mad Max so much and he hates it when I like something that is actually good, even if I dont hold everything in competition as he does.
I give Star Wars the benefit of the doubt and by all accounts the year isnt finished yet.
Being a realist critic and film lover for me means not giving yourself a heart attack before the film comes out,and annoying not everyone.

18,"I couldnt have said it better ,totally agree with you and it is a well made video.

A film student I know reasoned that the films lack of a final draft  or in his words - it felt like 1st draft script took away from the film.
I discussed with him about the things in the film ,but  what fascinated me is how he actually didn`t really catch on to anything (themes ,symbolism , world-building ,character backstory) that was shown subtlety , visually or with auditory.He only viewed it as an action senseless film without any metaphorical or world meanings.

The simple plot in my own opinion lends itself to focus on this unique mythological cartoon / comic method of story telling.Every time the camera would center on a prop it would seem to have some meaning since I would see that prop earlier in the film used differently.
Example Max`s the brown bag filled with Anti-seeds vs The keeper of the seeds brown bag filled with seeds.Why focus the camera like that and never really give expose or dialogue ?

Or that we hear a warboy yell witness in the first 5 minutes of the film (citadel escape scene) and it never gets explained yet after the film I know exactly the purpose and meaning of this ritual ? 
So I really enjoy show not tell stories , why I like the Wire so much .Perhaps other people just like being spoon-fed information and like having their action movies pre-chewed ;  flow and arch like the other action movie conventions.
The irony in my mind is that a film with such a simple plot  has a bit more depth to it underneath the surface if you look and listen.

19,"I have a confession :

Im a Hitchcock fan since I was a young lad.But I avoid watching his movies again lately.I have a narcissistic and egotistical film maker friend ,that I introduced to Hitchcock a few years ago,and his insufferable know-it-all fanboyism , redundant praise and hype for Hitchock has taken all the pleasure out of watching and enjoying his films anymore.Me watching his films for 20 years of my life , him 4 but Im made to feel inadequate in my opinions.
I have listened to him brag about himself and Hitchcock ,nearly on a weekly bases some times, for a the last couple of years.

In my case it wasnt so much that I viewed Hitchcock as this self-endulged film maker but more so my friends opinions about him and thus I felt it reflected so on the film maker which is not true for those reasons.Perhaps he is for other reasons.


I still think ,although I can consider him a master no other director that should follow is absolute in his shadow by default .Young artful film makers can even do and outdo  more visually and conceptually today than the film makers did in those days.(Compare Wes Anderson or Scorsese with Hitchcock)
This golden age syndrome that people have ,that old  film makers are better than the young lads of today is quite shallow and close-minded.Should no more film makers attempt to make films just because they arent considered masters as Kurosawa or Hitchcock ? I think  many new generation film makers and teams are doing incredible and ahead of the time things today, that would make Auteur artists like Hitchcock be send to Jelly school if they ever saw them.Film is evolving and people don`t really see how incredible these steps in its evolution are.

20,"My bad, it was his reasoning as to why the film failed narratively and with the characters for him at least ,not really questions. But in the conversation he had with the other members he was rather one-sided and found their love for the movie and reasoning unsatisfying.He even explained to them that he is a qualified  filmmaker  and film critic.
But  I do find his remarks on the film interesting even after some have given him some  good feedback ,which is always interesting in a respectful group.

Here is an example from someones feedback very  similar to some on this thread :

“Just to retort and I think ,yeah the script isnt a drama masterpiece but it gets the job done.
Rather not think so much about these small things and start thinking about how the narrative allows for various commentary on real-world problems and allows plausible action sequences even if a bit weird.
Thinking of last years dawn of the planet of the apes which had small things that didnt sit well with some but nothing was worth nit-picking either , that was a great film with a great theme but some small indiscrepancies.

1.) Actually mentioned this one in my comment above.In both Mad max 1 and 2 the villains just die, like normal men and non of them die by Max`s hand,physically.Toecutter is an escape accident and Lord Humangus a suicide.At least in this one the metaphor gets destroyed by the hand of the tormented.The mouth of the villain/false speaker.Think about that implication , its not perfect but it means something , even small or cheesy.Take into account he is an old jaded man who uses religion to control his fighter. He himself as a warrior is pretty MEDIOCRE –irony.

2. a )This one just ones own opinion.But perhaps it might have been cool to see it later, but I for one was glad not to see one of the cool parts in the trailer ,much later on.The coolest parts for me at least is the practical effects.Thats one of the few almost only CGI bits and I not a big deal,because Miller turned the amazing physical/visual/special effects up to 11 after that.You dont even notice the amazing cgi after that scene.I think it was in the trailer as well.Seriously it’s a good scene but its not nearly the best or structualy sound if you understand the narrative near the end,which I think you… 
2.b)The Storm  for me serves as an example and metaphor of the rest of the film as it happens in this scene.Within the storm we get to see high-octane  action but also a method for story telling and theme. It allows the good guys to have some gap over their pursuiters  ,think of the war party as a pack of wolves.It allows for character set-up ,old mad max action  references and an action scene between Furiosa and Max to built tension.We need this scene because the next fight scene will be the buddy bonding scene.
It also perfectly sets up Nuxs character arc and themes and introduces the musical symphony that will accompany his 2nd and 3rd attempts  to enter the gates of Valhalla.

3. Kinda agree here except that it cut is so fast and there is no external force helping max.I would like to see the scene again.Seeing dead people actually degrades is combat effectiveness? The hallucinations themselves tie in with the main theme as seen at the end of the film ,in the quote.
And 3 of the hallucinations are visions of the future.Things that will happen when they return to the citadel.In a way Max is like a prophet,.he guy that shoots him later stabs Furiosa.The girl being run over by Immortan Joes truck is Furiosa sister dodging  Joes truck but get hit by another one.

4 No.Maxs entire progression as a hero ,the one thing he has in common with both the villain is to convince Furiosa to turn back which ties in with the most important theme and social-commentary of the film.This will take too long to explain but remember the written quote at the end of the film?It ties in with that.Also keep in mind that Immortan Joe is an entire lie.He`s no Koba . 
He has war medals but he perhaps the most useless of anyone there.Hence the wolf in sheeps cloth.The mask and body suit he wears is a lie.Its a breathing apparatus for an old man ,why he indoctrinates his warriors.He is all talk and drive,not much else.
Nux learns this lie later on and becomes a fleshed out character based on this realization making his sacrifice truly remarkable.
Also NOOOO. Strong woman characters ! No need ape man to defend them like princess.Remember how the woman died in Road warrior.You make it sound so cliché.She got arrowed then got dragged underneath the wheels of a truck.Mad Max is grim stuff.Also Furiosas redemption story arc, and Max actin gas the healer and bloodbag , reduced to an object he chooses.
I mean she was similar to Ripley or Full Metal Bitch from edge of tomorrow.She is the only one who understand the political workings of the citadel.Who else will start “ chainging “ things around there?

5.a) Not a big deal ; I think this was with the elderly woman who have been living beyond the 'green place' in hopes that she would one day replant the world.These exiles who do not join a society (again reference to one of  the main themes ) will not survive.Yet they are some of the best shooters.Joe has hydroponics and plenty of everything (which is actually a scarce commodity) which he does not share, he waists.Perhaps Joe too would like to know where the green place is but the woman dont have those resources he has. Atleast now they are going back to water  and one of the brides care about this woman and her seeds.Atleast we know they wont ,hold monopoly and freakin copy rights over the seeds like some companies do in real-life and wont be exploited like Joe exploited food , water and humans. 
Not everything has to be explained and nicely wrapped up, you can think for yourself about some things in the film and this is really a no-brainer.
Remember most things happen to the good guys because of happenstance not heroics.
These are mostly small things that doesnt need to be explained , like the religion and rituals  , the crow people. etc.Things are often  shown not fully explained.
Think about the events prior and the consequences.

5.b)Remember when Max filled a brown bag with guns,the old lady or keeper of the seeds had a similar looking brown  bag with seeds which one of the brides took back to the citadel. There is hope!
Seed vs Anti-seeds (bullets)
Who destroyed the wolrd?Not men but corporate greed ,  war and religion.
They explain the seeds a few times, you were just to slow to catch on  or lazy to think about it.Sorry.
Just watch it again , and listen closely to the dialogue ,music and themes then  knit it together yourself. “

21,"I would recommend the following films with very interesting credit sequences and then mention a specific one and explain why it makes it unique.http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/title-sequences/31057/50-brilliant-movie-opening-credits-sequences or other articles.
The problem with some opening credits in feature films are that they feel like TV.Lynch and Robert Altman I think does this,but not as annoyingly as others.
Pixar does amazing opening and closing credits as does studio Ghibli ;setting up the mood like in  My neighbour Totoro.
Hitchcock/Saul Bass made some really cool looking opening credit sequences as in Vertigo.

Nolan does that Cold opening thing but Memento is more warm, where as Cronenberg does a more slow errie opening sequence.
Most horrors nowadays does that and even some thrillers.Thrillers like to go for either cold openings or warm openings in their case.Panic Room  ,Monsters Inc and Zombieland had interactive prop-like credits ,making it at least interesting to the background setting..Marvel films and tech savvy films like Brad Bird films does a more Hybrid-tech or cartoon montage opening sequence.I dislike tech savvy closing creditsthough.Doesnt do anything for me. 
Look at the incredible opening sequences and end sequences of 2014`s Leviathan.
Quentin Tarantino introduces his characters and cast as Sergio Leone did.
George Miller does it as well in Fury Road but with the lead actors and the characters they play in opening and  all other cast as characters and crew in the end, making it more of the introduction of an opera.

Now The Wrestler does something really well.It develops multiple themes through out the film , one of which is a golden-age syndrome type theme.The colorful opening credits is in the forefront of a montage of wrestling newspapers and articles,central to the theme of times gone past.
When the closing credits start a smart enough viewer should not hesitate to think that these credits could serve as the idea of a newspaper article on the very last thing Randy 'the Ram' did in his life ... died on stage.
Se7en ,alien ,persona and Funny Games  has some of the smartest opening title sequences and credits I have seen.It sets the mood right up.",2015-08-19 10:27:55+00:00,cu83udn,1.0,t3_3g1djn,1092394.0,TrueFilm
22,"Here is slightly mad  interpretation and I agree with the other comments on here as well.But I will try and keep mine short.
Immortan Joes bodysuit is transparent.We can see through it.
Its a false sense for whoever perceives it we the audience if we start to  understand the underlying character.
Chrome is like a coat of  ritualistic indoctrinated lies in context of the film much like Joes  rule.
Notice Nux didnt chrome himself when he sacs himself in the end...
Why do they say 'Mediocre' , in almost Judgemental way .
I believe this is another form of Joes way of spurring the half-live war boys on to always outdo themselves and each other and fully commit themselves to the cause and afterlife he promises them no matter what.
Off course Nux fails Joe,but how does his character arc change after this,keeping in mind this what he believes completely?
The Storm scene :  listen to the violins and the music that plays,this is Nux` theme.It plays again when he fails Joe but this time it is more darkly comical.
It plays again when he sacs himself instead this time the music build up and we get some epic hallelujah moment.
I mean the drums and speakers and trumpets and guitars all come flinging towards the screen almost weirdly operatic yet cartoonishly.
Like Capable said to him when they bonded ; it was his fate not to die when he chose to under those false conditions but when he did it was not mediocre at all.",2015-08-18 14:30:53+00:00,cu71yu3,2.0,t1_crg9mj4,7696381.0,TrueFilm
23,"Somethings a friend and myself discussed as possible explanations of things regarding the background story and world  or just things we notice that I can`t quite explain  but might help some thoughts and views others had. A lot of the stuff I didn`t get myself : 


The water wars?The world spend so much focus on oil that they forgot about water?
Who killed the world?
There seems to be some weird prophetical type thing going on with the 3 brothers and their riches and then the squander of it all with an exodus type thing later.
Immortan - Rank #1 and then ranked the mayors/brothers and sons etc.
Imperator  is probably like a lieutenant?
So these words in front of their names are their ranks or Patriarchy?
The half-life Warboys are the those afflicted with fallout and mutation hence half-life?
Some are coated with white ash  , probably those who hide their mutation or is this ritualistic?
Joe does it as well.
War pups =  young wolves ? Valhalla ? 
Immortan Joe looks like a wolf in sheep clothing , false messiah / prophet  /dictator with medallions and a staff.
He is like a reverse Moses vs Ramses where the dystopian place with icons, the citadel of death , the place of escape becomes Canaan, the place of return and hope.People give meaning to places , why we must take care of our own now , like the quote mentioned in the end about responsibility and being honest to find our better selves. 
The cars on the insides have logos of the citadel on them , like death cathedrals?
The citadel has two chrome teeth on them on that massive skull/room with the hydro-pump valves?
The chromes stuff is so bizarre but well written?Is it like shiny coat of lies like Joe`s transparent bulky armor and medals and his mask?
The fat lady turns the pumps on at the end on the chrome teeth.
The people eater has a gold nose - black gold-gas  ? 
Bullet farmer has a thing made of bullets.
Furiosa has oil/grease on her head?
The Girls in white are like sheep ,pure,  whatever?

Is Max a mad ass-kicking feral madman or afflicted with visons like a prophet , the herder?
I mean he basically has more and more severe hallucinations and then two or more of them get realised exactly later in the future as he saw it.
Visions : 
“Stop running max”
The arrow block creepy child vision he had before he decides to go back and help the woman.
Furiosa`s sister getting run over by a truck ,same child in vision acting that scene out.
Except the child gets run over by a truck that looks like Immortan Joe`s  truck , the sister dodges that but gets trampled under the grill of the People eater. 
The baby fetus of Splendid ,perhaps this is a guilt vision but neither the audience or max could see if she went under the wheels.

Bullet farmer has thing on his head made of bullets looks like a pharaoh  - Later blinded then looked like the lady of justice but does it have some significant meaning?
” I am the scales of justice! Conductor of the choir of death!
Sing, Brother Heckler! Sing, Brother Koch! Sing, brothers! Sing! Sing!”Certainly music plays a big part in this film. Even Immortan Joe hums a tune.But as he drives towards the Rig he gradually uses bigger guns.

1.) For a long part of the film, after the reveal of the Breeder/Bride slaves on board the War rig and after the big storm scene  it felt as if Immortan Joe only lead the pack in pursuit of Furiosa with a very relaxed pace, as if they are tailing them.Never really catching up even though they have really fast vehicles.
On one occasion he demands patience from his brother the Bullet Farmer but he drives off a head as did Nux in the earlier part of the pursuit.
The theory is that Immortan Joe even though he adored his breeders wanted very much to know where the green place is for various reasons  ; Perhaps Seeds , better opportunities to control society ,perhaps more woman to capture as breeders.Perhaps he will make use of Furiosa`s betrayal.
So did he tail furiosa?Its not a strong theory as the events and the scene with the death of Splendid Angharad somewhat disproves it , but it does make visually sense before those events otherwise it seems like bad writing on that chase sequence.???The importance of the seeds later hold significant truth to what Immortan Joe is trying to achieve at the citadel ?
Better conditions of survival.

2.)We don`t see any Gas stations or Roads or towns in this world ,the world has reverted back to a tribal form and  small societies. Control of these things probably led to more  wars. 
We have mountain people , a  tribe-like  Bandit folk who lives in the rocky areas where bikes are useful.
We have Russian speaking Buzzards  with spikes on their vehicles – The vehicles are almost like wild boars and horses .But why Russian Speaking? The vehicles themselves have battle scars .the have a somewhat lively characteristic to them.The lancers are very tribal yet technically modern.
The Death-Citadel looks very Mayan and off course The Vuvali Woman , Amazonian-like woman (Where do they get men to breed with in the past?)
There seems to be an ironic duality of the symbolisms and  parables of the world-building made  here and events and depiction of order and disorder/disobedience in this world, for instance between Green places before - The amazon and wastelands – the desert.
How far in the future is this movie that there are no more Gas stations , societies are rebuild with massive complexity , a place of many mothers etc.
But still we have that duality and contrast  of the old , Mayan or Egyptian like cities , Valhalla talk , tribal warlords etc. vs the new.
New Cars don`t get built 

3.) Music : Every time Nux wants to sacrifice himself his music theme comes up.That epic beautifyl song in the Sand Storm.Again With Immortan Joe and him having a conversation.
Only at the end does it build up to something great and quite ironic when we are treated with a big crash and flying drums , guitars , trumpets and speakers move towards us .Some hallelujah momen and big arc on his character.
But listen to his theme and in general how music changes to set a mood and explain things without explain them.
Before the war rig drives into the canyon we have Immortan Joe Chasing/tailing them and we here this Bum Bum dark music reminding us.The fact is however that he never sends his boys full speed ahead to get them until they returned where upon he learns the Citadel is undefended(Viking) and probably there is no green place and the canyon might get blocked whatever.Upon their return into the canyon this music plays again.
Also the buddy bond music between Max and Furiosa is well done and mixed.

4.) The ‘Witness me ‘ and the ‘mediocre’  phrases I felt where like some indoctrination slang terms.Not frat boy or Terrorist like but a bit darker.As if saying ’mediocre’ is too spur others on upon another`s suicide in order to drive them on ,to commit more and oversell their death if their turn comes. Committing to an ideology of awesome death that would always be mediocre.Hence the hallelujah moment and not the usual Mediocre with Nux`s sacrifice.

That is all I have for now.
