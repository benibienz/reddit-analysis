3,"Personally, I think you need more of a structure to these shows. Letting anyone come in and say something doesn't work that well in practice as you would probably admit as well with the dead time, people with not so great points etc. Maybe have people that want to appear email you before the show to sort of get a better idea about what they want to talk about before hand? Just to avoid that wasted time after a person gets on the call until they get to their point. 
Just one person's opinion though, love the idea of the show, just want it to be as awesome as it can be. ",2016-01-24 07:45:20+00:00,cz9tvax,1,t3_42d6go,32235,Speedruns

8,"Call me old fashioned, but talking for 15 seconds about a sponsor to me is totally fine, and is much better than watching a dude stroke his beard or a guy with 15 coffee cups trying too hard to be the next meme. It's an event, and almost all events have advertising. People that make money streaming, otherwise known as the big name streamers people tune in to see, make money from advertising (and subs). I don't have a problem with 30 second live commercials. 

As for ""Dump all the boring runs and runners and keep things exciting?"" who decides what is exciting? If you kept only the short games and huge streamers, the marathon would be a day or two long. 

A small change I would like to see would be to make the room ""feel"" smaller. Now its almost always feel like a half empty room with 3-4 dudes playing the game. Not sure that would get more donations, but it would be a nice change to bring a little bit of the early GDQ magic back. 

As for the numbers, I think just the novelty is beginning to wear off, but that doesn't mean these events won't continue to be awesome and make tons of money for charity twice a year. ",2016-01-11 07:07:52+00:00,cytteqr,1,t3_40fheq,2690,speedrun

Add that to added responsibilities like you said, and I'm just wondering how its all going to work out. Not that there aren't 1000s of ALTs out there that could use a little more responsiblity on the job of course, but will the new ones be equipped to do it? Will the (falling in some cases already) pay be enough to intice people to do be ALTs?

I went the translation/ALT website route after I felt like I had gotten everything I could out of teaching/got enough translation clients which turned out to take 7 years for me I guess. 

I knew one dude that ""went corporate"" but he quickly quit because probably the only stereotype that is 100% true in Japan, the insane amount demanded of you if you work for a company, turned out to be true for him. ""Why work way harder in Japan for the same money when you can go home and get the same with no overtime or 6 day work weeks?"" was his paraphrased reason.
