He now falls asleep himself at nighttime and sleeps pretty well (although he still wants two feedings).

Daytime though its a different story. 
We wait 2 hours or earlier if he shows the sleepy signs after any wake up, and hold him until hes drowsy and put him down in his crib. Sometimes, it works like nighttime and he's out. Other times he screams uncontrollably. After a little (or sometimes a lot) of soothing though he's usually out no matter what. 

The thing is, no matter how tired he is, no matter what method he used to get to sleep, no matter where he is, he will only sleep 30 minutes and will wake up beaming and happy to be awake, meaning its impossible to put him back down without wailing. He of course gets tired and cranky an hour or so after waking, and the cycle continues through 4 or so mini naps a day.

Any help to a first time dad that wants his kid to be more happy throughout the day as a result of longer naps?",Parenting,30 minute napping 6-month old,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/40r5eq/30_minute_napping_6month_old/

At worst it.... I can't think of a negative. 
Why hasn't this change been made?

EDIT: I realize I can turn off the chat. I just think the better option to create possibly an average chat experience actually about the games AND raise more money for charity from the subs (which is the whole point) would be sub-only chat.
