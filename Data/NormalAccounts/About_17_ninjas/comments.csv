134,"This seems like something we can't agree on lol.

I can't imagine Michael Douglas costing same or more than Jared Leto. Michael Douglas is an old actor who doesn't have a lot of fans rushing to his movies. Jared Leto is a recent Oscar winner and headlines a band. Plus there is a lot more actors in Suicide Squad than in Ant-man. 

Suicide Squad filmed in Canda and rented a whole part of a city and who knows what else they build. Ant-man was basically in pre-existing structures and inside most of the time.

In Ant-Man there was only one hero with his abilites so they could reuse the same assets whenever he shrinked down. The Michael Douglas cgi was like a couple of seconds and couldn't cost that much especially with Make-up. Same with the Quantum realm which didn't last for long.

Suicide Squad has many superheroes with different powers and multiple eyes of the adversaries.

Lastly I'm not saying that SS has the same budget as BvS. I'm saying they have a bigger budget than Ant-Man. Besides, don't take this the wrong way, but you don't work in accounting (Presumably) or Hollywood and can't say it's poor planning without knowing all the details. That's like saying to a doctor that vaccines cause autism.

Besides even if Paul Rudd cost as much as Margot Robbie per se, they still had to pay Will Smith, Jared Leto, all the other members of the squad.

I don't know where you're getting that cgi info from. I'm getting based on the Ant-Man movie and SS trailers. It still is too early to say, but it looks like SS is going to have a lot of action scenes. I don't know if you've seen Ant-Man, but trust me, the action scenes in that weren't going to cost a lot.

I don't know why you are being so aggressive (at least I think so reading your text) even though I have been one of the good (or how you want to define it) here. You have even accused me of something that I didn't do and left our conversation without an apology (which is a little unnecessery, so you don't have to anymore) or an agreement.

Not to mean that I don't respect your work. You could also share your work with others. You told me that you usually do the banning and cleaning comments and the mod post and the sticking and etc. Unless other mods do something themselves too like making flairs, why don't they help you. Heck, recruit more mods. I haven't seen other mods do alot so they must be working on the behind the scenes or just lazy. (Note: I'm saying that it's a possibility, not that they are.)

To your first question, yes you can sleep. Unless you have a sleep disorder like insomnia or you're threatened not to sleep, then yeah I would understand if you can't sleep. 

Second question I would say no, I don't think so. I follow you on twitter and seen your pictures, unless they are taken from someone else which I highly doubt.


Also since you brought it up although it wasn't the purpose of my message to /u/HaydenJameSmith, isn't it better to help mods by reporting about bad posts?

You go to the MCU subreddit and see discussions and pictures of MCU related stuff. Here it's pretty same except that there are posts like this https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/42c6pz/did_rmovies_take_over_imgur_with_their_opinions/. People are calling the users on imgur salty, biased and cynical even though the comments on imgur are just normal. Zack Snyder isn't known for making good movies, MoS was divided and 2nd trailer sucked for majority of people.

I have seen that the people from marvelstudios are the best ones (even though there are a lot good people here too). Like I said, I don't want to call anybody out, but it's getting really bad.

I really wanted to make the audience a promise that… though I’m super excited and happy and fulfilled by the conflict of Batman and Superman, there’s also a bigger world to start to think about.""

I agree with you that they didn't want it to leak, but there isn't definitive proof that they were scared of leaks.

So our plan right now is to make all these films PG-13. In some cases, you know, right there on the edge of PG-13, but still PG-13.”
