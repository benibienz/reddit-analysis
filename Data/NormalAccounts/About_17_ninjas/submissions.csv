I would compare The Winter soldier with TDKR. Now as a massive DC fan, it's hard to argue that WC isn't better than TDKR. 

Now the behemoth The Dark Knight. A movie which forced the Oscars to nominate more than five movies per year and for which an actor won an oscar deservedly.

All the info we've got for now indicate that Gal and Jesse will be amazing and I don't need to say anything about Ben Affleck, do I.

For SS people were happy with the casting, but there were some hiccups. I agree that Jai Courtney doesn't have a lot of charisma for a leading character, I think that he'll be great as Captain Boomerang, because of Boomerang's personality. People questioned if Will Smith was going to be a good team player, but I think he's gonna be great. He just oozes of charisma. 

I truly think in the future when WB announces a controversial casting decision, people are gonna say: ""Look at Jesse's casting as Lex and Gal's casting as WW. They know what they are doing and we should just trust them.""

What do you guys think?

That makes you thing if the feel of that movie will be different than BvS. 

You have to remember that the DoP was someone else than Larry Fong and also people didn't like the cinematography in MoS a lot. Because of those I thing it was changed. Also because Batman being in the film as well, they had to make it darker to suit Batman.

Would you want them to have the same cinematography in JL as BvS to connect those two movies! Or do you want something different so that DCEU movies will be different by the look. MCU has pretty much have the same look with all of their movies with some change. Wether that's good or bad depends on the person.

I personally would like something different. I don't think the look of BvS will fit the other superheros like Flash or Cyborg. I would want at least a little brighter.

I say this, because I want this subreddit to get better and bigger, where we can have rational discussions.

Not that I thought that the fight scenes weren't good, but because there were too many. IMO the best scenes were scenes where they just talked like the party and the farm house scenes. 

That's what I want more in superhero team-up movies. If you want  to see action go to their stand-alone films. In these films I want different superheroes to interact with each other. For example, I can't wait to see how Clark and Bruce will talk and react to each other in BvS 

In CA:CW Spiderman and Ant-man will appear. Imagine how a god, a genius, a captain and others will react to those two. Peter, Scott and Tony will keep on delivering one-liners, Cap is going to feel baffled etc. Another negative in A:AOU (although I liked the movie)was that almost every character delivered one-liners even though that's Tony's job.

The following was in the Empire magazine:



""Snyder and Chris Terrio the Argo screenwriter who was brought on to Batman v Superman for a rewrite and who has since finished the Justice League script –locked themselves in a room with an enormous supply of Diet Coke and plotted out their epic saga visually, like a giant cave painting. “Chris would talk and I would draw it and it was basically this weird mural of the movies with no words,” said Snyder. Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns is noted as one of the influences on their plot.""



As you can see Chris Terrio planned the movies for at least to 2020. That really makes me happy, because Zach Snyder is the best visual directors around, he isn't known for his plot. When you instead hear about Terrio, you hear how great his scripts are. Those two together means something amazing will happen.



I wish Terrio planned beyond 2020 to like 2025, because he really is a great writer and as a writer, he plans out movies differently than say Kevin Feige,



I really hope Chris Terrio comes back at some point to lay out the next movies and even write Justice League 3.
