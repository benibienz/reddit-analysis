15,"One of the strength of the build its that it allows Nasus to beat several bad matchups, so in some cases, it's an alternative to consider absolutely. No later than 2 days ago, I absolutely destroyed a main Teemo. The main point of playing Quasus it's to adopt a PRO-ACTIVE gameplay and make THINGS HAPPENS, instead of hoping your team to carry you until you can carry them. Quasus creates an incomparable amount of pressure on turrets (well, lots of champion can do that). The key, its the momentum, the way it is played it creates A LOT OF MOMENTUM. The jungler can never ever ignored the toplane because most if not all champion (except Darius... but somehow ive seen Quas beating Darius too, but I can't yet), get pushed hard by Nasus. The harass is crazy. Nasus can escape most of ganks, even when you are pressuring turret tier 2, You have your W, high base movement speed, you will have phage proc someday, you have raptor cloaks passive, stormraider surge + I like Swiftness boots most of the time. So you become to most annoying thing in the world, you can take the trade you want, harass as you wish, sustain with lifesteal, push all turrets and drag the attention of a lot of members. The lower your elo, the least effective it is, for me it work in Gold (second account) and Platinum, but id expect this gameplay to work even better at higher lvl. Because your team knows how to react to Map positioning, as soon as they see 2-3 members on you they will work it out something to punish it, which isn't going to happen much the lower the elo you are. My KDA are always not pretty, I don't kill much, I don't die much (or sometimes I die a lot, but I will die if they did a terrible mistake... like sending 3-4 on me while I read my team will benefit from it... this part is hard to understand... I see my team position, I have few wards, I cant see everything, but I know if they send too many people right now, they will pay for it, and Quasus is outstanding at buying LOTS OF TIME). You still get 200-300 stack which is enough to put down turret with few Qs. The early turrets you get by yourself or the ones your team got because you dragged attention is how you win, the team snowballs from global gold, as soon as the team snowball, it gets even harder to deal with Nasus, because the 4v3, 4v2 out there on the map will be even more punishable, you have better item than your lane opponent yourself so you can deal with him easily 1v1 and still not being outpushed. Note: On that game with teemo, I escaped 2 ganks, + a 3rd gank where ive been able to hold and the midlaner in my lane for more than 1 minute throught kiting, harassing and prevent him to recall, all that without losing my push, I almost killed them both (I almost died too ;) ). I just loved how very little counterplay there is to deal with the style, lets hope it doesn't get too popular because it definitely worth a nerf. Lastly, IT IS NOT EASY, you need to have very good macro understanding, the smarter you are, the better it goes.",2016-11-21 20:21:32+00:00,da9z4xa,,t1_da9tzk5,6096.0,summonerschool

Reality is that often people restrict themselves by jumping from fog of war onto a laner.

That being said tho, Zac is such a good farm machine, he gets so much from farming faster than most of champions that ganking early becomes suboptimal. Yes his runes are VERY important. I personaly run 30% cdr. Most of people will run at least 20. He has very very few good items available to him that gives CDR other than boots and SV (I run 30%cdr because I want tabi boots).

But that will always keep Kennen dmg low (compare to his peers), w/e the type of build you go. Kennen works a bit like urgot, if you can't hinder key target to deal dmg, then you are useless, the ennemy ADcarry will outdmg you anyday. Kennen ADC has a lot of success with a teamcomp who wants to fight forever. Maokai, Vladimir, Zac... maybe not all them togheter in one team but this kind of champion would make a kennen adc successful. If you OTP kennen, id suggest to Duo with a splitpusher like Nasus, jax or Tryndamere. Its my humble opinion... its impossible to rush a fight or dive against a kennen. Kennen also works well against idiots heavy melee comp like: Diana, Hecarim, Leona, Sejuani, w/e ADC... while all the melees wants to jump in (sadly and very often... all at same time) you can disable them all",2016-11-18 00:13:58+00:00,da4z04l,1.0,t3_5dja0u,1092.0,summonerschool

The flat HP is VERY useful if not VERY IMPORTANT. This ASSURE you to go through lvl 1-2 which are lvl that can kill your lane if you fail there. With those runes you can trade A LOT and set your lane dominance right on as soon as lvl 1. You can play your first 3 lvl SOOOO aggressive.

You can absolutely harass him and be aggressive on him without pushing the wave.

At this point you push your lane, ult away, you make things happen in other lane and comeback to face Nasus. I'll get a Zzz,rot next to give me even more time if I leave Nasus on his own to pressure elsewhere. You usually outduel him when he is not ulted, don't forget to W his Q so he doesn't get his SS proc, if he ult you disengage with E over wall, we have now the red plant in the jungle to disengage this guy too. You comeback as his ult is off no worry, you can fight him there. As long as you play around your Q empowered AA, your W, your passive. I know I have talked about one champion specificly. To make it more general: Apply early pressure (make sure to respect his jungler), get Executioner calling if you plan to duel him, get a Zz'rot so he can't push much while you work elsewhere, bait his ult and disengage, fight when he has no ult. Another tip, if its standard Nasus (Max Q), he has NO good wave push until lvl 13, if you have a good pusher as toplane, who cant duel nasus, you should work opposite side of the map and apply greater pressure on the other side. Whenever someone (else) show up for you, your team suddenly get a powerplay 4v3. You must find a way to keep him pushed (if you work other side of the map and push better he will have to recall and take on your side), as long as he is pushed he cant hurt nobody, and you gain more xp more farm and window opportunity to help your team, while he cant do so effectivly.",2016-11-16 18:03:10+00:00,da30odt,1.0,t3_5dagp2,1964.0,summonerschool

The thing happening, if you max E and invest in early game items (doran's) you turn into a pro active Nasus, instead of a Nasus who cross finger to get carried until he stacks enough. The max E ultra pressure + heavily investing in the early game turns to be a much ""weaker"" nasus dmg threat. But your items earned with all the pressure on your lane (1-2 turrets down early) and/or probably on other lanes due to the pressure Nasus has dragged on him (THATS WHERE QUAS' NASUS SUCKS AT LOW ELO), makes it a more benefical way to play Nasus, since you somewhat (better) control your faith. if your team is unable to followup the edge you are trying to create, you ends up holding only on your macro mastery to win a game (if it goes too late), since you have not many stacks, but u still can count on that immense pressure capacities with E and zzrot, high base movement speed, W to prevent chase, etc... with 300-400 stacks (instead of 700+) you arent so much threatful to champions, but no one can ignore how quick a turret fall down.

Quinn is a pain for almost every toplaner you still have kill potential on her du to your ability to gapclose better than her E can disengage, but most of the time you will absorb too much dmg to attempt it, just like Kennen, if you play it well you will eventually be able to all-in her if you can hit your stuff consecutively. Don't forget that your Q slows a lot and it has quite low cooldown. Gnar is very easy, if you manage to hit one Q, dodge his at same time he is dead, you slow enough to catch him after his hop.

230," Its important to track the possible jungler position, there is a variety of information available to you without warding. Bot lane shows late in lane at start? He started botside, as a midlaner what can you do? Position on the top side of the lane, you can use your ward on topside if you want around 3minutes, usually 2:50 is a good timing. Again, position on the oposite side in lane, botside this time. The jungler is leaving for his blue, there you know where the jungler is, he could be in the next 25seconds ganking from that side or 50sec to 80secs on the other side (when he goes for blue, i usually like to go ward raptors, if the camp is empty it means red alert for the lanes on that buff side) if the camp is spawned, its dangerous on that side of the map in that 50-80 next seconds. If you can track the threats, it will naturally tell you where to ward. A typical mistake its to ward just bcuz... just bcuz yeah my trinket is up, lets ward... even if the jungler showed up 5 sec ago at the oposite side of the map... that trinket ward will be expired by the time the threat is around. Dont forget to watch the other lanes if they are pushed or not, if they are pushed you have to consider the roaming threat from that ennemy, you might to ward to protect yourself from that roamer, not just a jungler. An important point on warding, what you want its to know where he is AND WHAT HE IS DOING because, again, you want to be able to track his movements and intentions, dropping a single ward beside ur lane only to protect ur butt is close to useless (unless you suspect he is right there right now, if you do go for a ward with this purpose you will ward overwall plz, right?

Shyvana outduel 99% of the champions. Shyvana takes advantage if she can cripple the ennemy jungler, take objectives and later splitting easily since almost no one can 1v1 her.

Tips: Cinderhulk+triforce+titanic works wonder against squishy teams, too often people sticks so hard on BR regardless of the situation.

307,"To freeze for an extended period of time is more often not good. Since you are closer to your turret, your opponent has the first step out of the lane to respond to anything happening in the surrounding, and it kills opportunity to TP for a play. Its good if you are stronger early, you deny xp from 5-7 minions so you always get the level first. If you are much stronger than your opponent its silly to freeze, if you go read all the post ""i won my lane and lost the game""... well thats it... if you dont apply pressure and spread your lead over the map you might beat one oponent but have no further impact to destroy the nexus. If you push, you get pressure on the turret, you open the path for your jungler to invade, you can go deep ward, you can roam midlane, you can tp bot, he cant tp bot (unless he is willing to lose lots of minions on his turret). You slowdown the pressure if you have no more ward and have no idea where their jungler is, as soon as he show up somehwere on map, you can apply pressure again. If You have no flash, even if you have vision, you take even fewer risks, until you know exactly where the jungler stand. Toplane is far from the action for a jungler, and there is only one player to kill for him, it takes a lot of time on the jungler to go up there, lots of time investment. The best gift you can give to your team its their jungler attention on you and make him waste his time, have your ward deep, take the scruddle (all things you can only if you push), see him well ahead of time, let him walk to top then backoff. Conclusion: You want to push as much ***as you can*** if the vision allows it, if your matchup allows it, attract ***smartly*** that jungler top, get that turret down. Edit: The way you want it done its throught SLOW pushing, have it pushing by building more than one wave toward his turret. That way, it may strongly make it impossible for your opponent  all-in you unless he wants to die on the minions' dmg, if you have 2-3 waves built early you might even have a very good chance to 1v2 the jungler if you sit in it. Slow pushing makes it easier to time a dive with the midlaner jungle on top turret (you shove as they are getting close). Tip: if you know the jungler just entered your map quadrant and he is strong, scary and mobile, like Lee and Hecarim, SHOVE IT, it resets the lane, you dont have to touch the minion at all it will slow push towards you, so you may even sit and wait in the bush until you get more information",2016-10-26 01:37:16+00:00,d97wohu,1.0,t3_59e6zc,9155.0,summonerschool

A tank jungler who snowballs has a LOT more impact than a tank top or support. You can walk to each turret one by one and dive the fk out of them, you can walk, facecheck, ward everywhere you want. This is very opressive and more often just put the game out of control and the path to the nexus is free-open. The only downside, if you have TRUE potatoes and the opponent find a way to stall out the game, you rely more on your mates to close a game LATE, at this point you must be perfect, you have one ult that means everything.

No. i have 300+ Ranked games on Velkoz, 150+ Ranked  on Xerath, over 80 games on Ziggs, around the same for Varus and Lux and meaningless amount on AP Kog. I love Poke/Seige champions and im in a really good position to set my opinion about it, Ziggs is the worst in this category.

Jayce only can kill if he hits almost everything (bcuz he runs out of mana). Before and after first back, his mana pool is bad. You need to understand his cooldowns, as soon as he switches of stance you can step forward (more than you actually would, i dont mean being agressive), he just Gate-E-Q and missed (or the dmg wasnt meaningful on you), you can  stepforward. You need to use those little windows to either trade, farm for less dmg taken, deny minions, not let him stack a wave. Jayce is very squishy, you want to hold on minions even as much as you can when you arent going to get too punish for it. Early game minions are your best friends early to keep trades even when he goes agressive on your side, specially vs a squishy. If you are still decently healthy, There is a point where he can't full combo du to his mana pool, it is at this point you get more agressive in between his major ability Q cooldowns to force him burn his precious mana using his other less powerful ability to answer your actions.

Cait is pretty vulnerable on her own. An interesting move is to push the lane with your support, send the support mid warding on her way, you recall if you have business there, join mid or gank top from lane (if you go by river you got to be absolutly sure its safe) if you get a good trade top, you can chip the turret a lot from it if not taking it (even if the toplane is pushed, just showing up and get free hit on turret is good too).

The W mechanic is quite hard to use properly for somewhat very little reward, its funny, it looks nice, but the difficulty and unreliability of the ability doesnt match the power if it. I really like the E potential. Xerath is a true long range champion, the Q have a very long EFFECTIVE range, also hit everyone in the line at the same time for the same amount of dmg (unlike Varus Q), that means his Qs hurt the backline in fights while Ziggs bomb arent going back there, they will hit the frontline, terrains or bounce at 5 teemo/hour and easy to dodge. Ziggs ult is quite strong for fights if their team is positioned to get well nuked... if you use it on their backline and they are not cc or to busy it will just zone em off.

I run Runes that arent going to give me outstanding trade early, Mpen, HP/lvl, 6 cdr/lvl, 3 MR, ***3 MS***. Do not try look for trade before your first back. Most of the time you get a far better lead by pushing hard. Hit most of minions with W and you can angle it to get a stack on ur opponent. How can you ending up trading? Going for a last hit with Q and one bolt hit your opponent, it can be interesting to toss a W (still hitting the minions please!) towards him, if you get the feel of your opponent you can keep going with AA and try a E + next CD spell available. I might try an offensive E for when he goes for cannon minion since it has better chance of success. Second, whenever i get 2 stacks for some reason (poke or he was negligent) i will position slightly more agressive for a third stack if he doesnt respect it. So whats the reason of all that and not being agressive? I want to make sure i have a back with at least 1200, because with this, i will be VERY powerful, getting kick out of lane early is devastating on my timings. I will be back at lvl 6 with boots and chapter. Then i look everywhere i could get a kill, wherever there is no flash its usually a free kill with the ult. The lvl 6 kill is so constant i wont gamble my game before that. I want my 6 and my first back before bot does, before the jungler does. Just playing undirect poke (from farming) is most of the time enough to get yourself a 10-15cs lead from there, before your first back you can go oom choose carefully your occasion if your spells arent going to hit minions, the combo EWQ is very costly, you can do it once maybe twice before your first back thats it or you go OOM, after your first purchase (chapter) you will never go oom for the rest of the game. So, being said, if the laner doesnt want to trade, idgaf, i'm not trading, unless he messed up, im not working hard to making do mistake or to commit to anything before my first back, ofc you will end up trading often, im just trying to explain with what mentality i approach my pre-6.",2016-10-12 19:10:11+00:00,d8p6wuf,1.0,t3_575i85,4075.0,summonerschool

But Lee Sin had that all year too, the fact that Lee Sin rely on a skillshot (hello meteos) to acheive anything has been the main reason to pick the other 2 before him.

Skarner have very strong numbers, good clear, decent gank potential, very very good skirmish power etc...

The supports this season are very strong, tristana doesnt = free push anymore, her laning phase can be VERY difficult against some adc or some supports. I love tristana because im not the type of agressive player in lane, she can easily punish a bad recall time (its good idea to fake a back against adc with bad push aka vayne, let them recall, push the wave and you can get free 50% of the turret with a EQ). Ashe have very easy laning phase and can bully out some bot comp. Ashe mid game is all about Arrow and utility because her dmg is not online yet. Tristana midgame is all about luck, if your team did well you can snowball, if they are behind you are useless, your dmg is bad, your range is still too short, i like to go where i can dmg turret than where i could be forced to fight. Im saying luck, because you dont have necersaly control on your team if they will fight or if they will be smart and coordinate to look for turrets throught good rotation as they should be doing with trist. If trist snowballs luckily early, its a dead game, her jumps is so opressive you can takedown any turret, take any fight it really get out of control.

Velkoz has more survavibilty tools than xerath. On one point you have mentionned, viktor azir, velkoz is one of the best counter to azir, viktor doesnt bother me at all but its not as easy as to deal with azir.

802,"Top, and its not considering the matchups, its considering what Kayle does. She farm, farm, and farm again. The most important thing from a midlaner its the ability to impact the map. Having a Kayle who puts everyone on hold until she gets 3 items, it sucks for everyone and can easily cost the game. It exposes your jungler since u cant help him effectivly and you cant even followup properly his gank most of the time, giving up the easiest (or let say the lane holding the most opportunities to show up quick to make plays) lane to gank for a jungler who then needs  to cross the map everytime to make plays. The only not too bad plan, its if you can be releguated to sidelane early and split. That needs a winning botlane, but they have to win it with an early useless mid. I cant stand the afk mid farmers. Kayle jungle will become even stronger than laner kayle, but same apply as for mid, but for an extended period of time, afk useless jungler for even longer since it takes more time to rampup. Yes there is some successful powerfarmer jungler like Udyr or Shyvana, but these guys can hold their own in duel at any point, they can counter jungle effectivly at any point, kayle is straight crap at counter jungling, you basicly farm ur own camp and crossfinger when u do the scruddle.

Its a bit suboptimal in most scenario, unless you truely trust a carry in your team. Going Athene hurt your dmg output a lot for a utility trade. It is not recommended to go Athene. Karma has a very good laning, the champ is team reliant, you will never ever turn around a game by yourself, you can help/boost so-so team to become strong team, you can make plays to snowball even further a good carry, but you are never going to have your losing team on your shoulder. If you are the only good player in your team, even being 11/0/0 wont bring you closer to a victory if your dmg dealers are boosted animals. If your team has a edge over the ennemy and you are doing good to, its pretty hard to lose that edge in a Karma team. She is strong at any point of the game but in different aspect, strong early in the matter easy laning, strong mid from her dmg output, outstanding utility lategame.

If the game goes far long, you are an unstopable force. I love tristana mostly because of her ability to farm by herself, and push if the tesm does poor rotation. I have many games where ive done not much than taking turrets for my team and let them snowball from there, where we won without even be a dps threat yet. Just the gold from objectives. Im a jungler/mid, i moved to play only adc since 1month (Plat III)  my focus has always been the objective games (I play Velkoz/Xerath mid). Tristana just fit this. Ezreal isnt terrible at taking turrets but his pushing power is abyssimal. I dont mean here you dont climb because of your champion choice, i just want to suggest you to try out more objective/waveclear/utility focus adc to see how it works for you. Sivir, Corki, Ashe.

933,"Corki doesnt feel good at first. He has low range and his AA animation is weird. It seems impossible to trade at first. This champ is quite unique and you need to give it time before to understand your manoeuvre margin. I would recommend to watch some videos on youtube and get yourself an idea how to play it (Use recent videos since corki got a shit load of changes since one year). Corki is known as a poke, but the true fact is that he doesnt have much poking power before 11. At lvl 6 his normal rockets are weak, red rocket fine. At lvl 11 his red rockets really hurt and his normal rocket are fine. At lvl 16 your oppoenent must dodge it all of them (make sure to have at least 4 for fights!!!! they are your burst sheen proc dmg!). at lvl 6-15 you should use your rocket either to farm safe or to activate proc of sheen/triforce. Corki's burst is phenomenal and he offers some decent sustain dmg aswell, his poke is fine. An additional challenge as Corki it is your mana management, you need to learn that aswell. Corki is a tough champion to learn, he is in a weaker position right now, all that set you for a more difficult learning curve. It does worth the shot, i love corki, i play mostly Tristana and Corki. If you do want to learn corki, i suggest you to queue as Midlaner. Because Corki deal 76% magic dmg, he can only be picked (wisely) sometimes as Bot. It is pretty hard to itemize early against MR, it is wise to avoid picking corki in an already heavy AP team (his only efficient item for it its Voidstaff, its terrible to buy early). The masterie 12/18/0 thunderlord. I run pretty standard ADC runes except i have a page with some blue mana/regen if i dont face AP threat in lane. Build Triforce (as midlaner you may build earlier hexdrinker if needed), sorcs shoes, Here you want a dirk or BF sword, then finish Maw if you benefit a lot of it or start PD/RFC. You will either choose to get BT or IE next. If your build in a game looks like Tri, Sorcs, RFC, BT and the opponent builds MR, get a voidstaff. other than that, GA and MS should be in your item pool of choice. The order you build your items will affect greatly your dmg output, after Triforce and Sorcs, you have a lot of flexibility to make the right choice.",2016-09-12 07:05:23+00:00,d7jai2v,1.0,t3_52cnhx,9018.0,summonerschool

1021,"There is plenty of good tips here and i will try to not repeat some already communicated. If you feel/know the junglers is on the same side as you are, you have to assess if he is stronger than you 1v1, 2v2. Look at your lanes if they are pushing or being pushed, that will tell you if they can afford leaving the lane and response before their opponent! Look at which one he is more likely to gank for it aswell. If he is stronger, there is no point invading his jungle if you know he is in there somewhere. Ward for your lane instead or plan a countergank if you have the tools and laners to revert it for kills on your side. The right time to counterjungle and deep ward is usualy when he is spotted oposite side. Because you are not only stealing his camps, you are warding exactly where he is going to be in the next minute. Make sure your ward will identify what lane he is going for. Your mates on that side of the map should hold on their ward until he is spoted in his jungle and then secure their entrance as they know he is around. From there, the mind games begin since you have an extra step on him, would you prefer counterganking or recall and take his other side while he is walking in an empty jungle? When you invade, make sure sure sure you have the scruddle control, if he has it, dont go in there, the speedboost from scruddle helps your escape if you have it or help them catchup on you if they have it.

Where infernal is an investment for mid-late game, i think he is still a very strong dragon, but taking it early is a direct sacrifice to lane pressure (Infernal is the strongest late game dragon buff, but the cost vs what you get after taking it make me put Cloud drake priority #1). Mountain dragon is not something to risk anything for it in SoloQ, he is a valuable dragon but i wouldnt trade it for anything, turrets, pressure, kills all those are more valuable from my point of view.

1117,"Some champion picks, especially those who are farming based have very good kit to make sure they acheive it. We all faced a Nasus that we can't stop from farming and we all know how frustrating to watch someone who you know will outscale you very hard. In those cases, teamwork is the key, no secret here. To play well against veigar, you either have to force him out of lane with fast pushing and good roaming, or freezing waves with a champion with strong ability to zone out, here wave manipulation is the key. As i have Urgot in my champion pool, Veigar isn't a big deal for me if i can counter pick on him, because i can easily zone him out. But giving a tip ""play this champ"" is stupid. Freezing a wave as much as you can is the absolute goodness, because Veigar is a shitty roamer, with some champions its easier to do, those who can punish if he walk forward from afar to W the wave, he needs to be punished it or he will break the freeze for free. Some champ with very strong pushing power and good ganking response can make his life very hard under turret, like Morgana for example, since she can sit in front of his tower with low probability of consequences, there is surely other champs who can do that but i have none in mind right now. Pushing and roaming is usually the more accessible tool in hand for most midlaners.

I've left a specific advice to avoid an early counterjungling du to be late in the pace. It is by keeping the pace up and being ahead in movements that you keep being first in key positions (for ganking, counterganking, tower dives, counterjungling... everything, because everwhere you have the foot first on the spot). In the scenario explained, an incorrect decision making leads to be behind and predictable, that makes the counterjungling or even contesting camps against you easier. Being behind in the pace leaves you to walk on top of ennemy jungler wards aswell. My last tip counts for it, pick champions who clears faster.

They are not like Rammus who takes forever on each camp, on champs like that you have basicly to sacrifice your map presence to take a camp. On champions with good early ganks potential and good clear, they will get a lvl3 quick that includes the red buff and jump in the river for the scruddle, while they do the scruddle, they watch both lanes and ward around to spot the ennemy jungler. While you do the scruddle you are in position to take actions on 2 lanes, you are warding, you are regenerating, you basicly look for opportunities, if nothing showsup, you go back in your jungle with a nice full health and mana bar. Countergank  is much more valuable than a powergank, thats why in competitive they always pick very fast junglers so they arent slowdown by clearance and they are working to outpace their opponent jungler to be at the juicy place, in position, first.

If the mid turrets is not takeable yet (example: Ziggs mid and Graves jungle, you will waste so much time), i would push bot, recall, gank top as duo and immediatly send top+jungle bot. Doing so, you always have an extra pace on the other botlane. Botlane matching you on toplane once you pushed? Rotate mid, preferably as 5. Then all neutral objectives are yours. Dancing from botlane to midlane (push bot, go mid dmg a bit tower, back to botlane, catch the wave, push the wave, go mid dmg tower, rinse, repeat) is good aswell.

If they arent, dont get drag down even further, leave and watch painfuly those cs melting.

If you play corki for example, farm ur triforce and go kick-a$$es on the map once you have it, drag, tower crash, rift herald, buff deny etc. Veigar is really vulnerable if he doesnt have his turret anymore, good sidelanes rotation to mid to take an opportunity to destroy his turret quickly is a really good plan to invest in.

There is some habits you would use that doesnt belong anymore, keep playing as those little things are easy to pickup (especially using the shortest path!! After a time, You are going to play like you might be seen right now, as said there is a lot more vision). After a time, go back play gold if u know someone with an account. You will understand why u felt like this. The bigger difference is the amount of vision and the players' reaction to someone who is at the wrong place (instant colapse, instant baron, rotation immediatly top etc...). Mechanicly, players are very similar to gold, perhaps a little better at dodging and anticipating a very telegraphed ability/intention (mumu walking toward the team in vision Q the target in the middle and ult 5 is no more so easy :P), you get punished a bit more for mistakes or complaisance. Breifly, rule of thumb, players are doing less mistakes and punishes faster mistakes, this true for each tier from Bronze V to LCS.

SHYVANA IS NOT MASTER YI OR OLAF, people tends to play shyvana to be a sticky monster, u dont need to be unstopable movement bot, you have to position get in burst disrupt (perhaps get out if u have to) you go in when you have an opportunity, if u want to go head down with frozen mallet and ghost, play olaf instead.

If you dont catch someone you thought was out of position with W, chill smite and botkr and you tell yourself ""ho shit, if i had frozenmallet/ghost""...? Like wtf? No... Answer is you went in at the wrong time and the target was in the right position, thats it.

The two last slots can also vary, i prefer BT and Void staff if nothing force me to get another situational item instead of these, there is many items who fit out there, specialy if you found yourself forced to build hextech blade before triforce. If you plan to buy hextech blade, make sure to start long sword + green pot. That make your first recall requirement much easier to reach (900gold). The core build is triforce, PD/RFC, IE. As Corki deal a lot of dmg, building Zonyas is NOT optimal, but not discusting, i will build it against a wukong in their team. For summoner spells i choose 50/50 exaust or ignite paired with flash, rarely heal/barrier.

Pick the one you like and play it (except vayne). ADC is the most linear role of all. Spend your time learning the concepts of the role, its the easiest role to play different champions since they all use the same based concepts, range dps. Focus on being adc and stop worrying which champ for high elo. If you are a ""noob"" adc, i would suggest to learn Miss Fortune or Jinx and stick to it until you have learnt the different concepts. Every adc are viable at all elo (except vayne). Others role like mid, there is Assassins, Control mages, Support mages, Fighters, Poke mages etc... All applying different patterns and concepts, its better there to stick to one or two... You dont have those worries as adc.

Your reasoning ''because lane bullies can be picked'' thats right... This is all what is going to be the meta if it happens. Teams are forced to pick champion who does great 1v1, 2v2. That hinder by a lot the diversity since players will pick strong laners only (Hello Season3!). The lane swap gives the opportunity to pick who ever you want to have in your teamcomp. Even without much early action, games can close as soon as 25minutes. Picking scaling comp because of the laneswap guarantee nothing. As the season goes, not much major changes have been made to the map so the players have recently perfected the meta and this is what Riot isnt happy to see. There is a trinity in each role at this moment, the BEST way to win has been discovered and perfected.  Again in my first comment, i hope it wont affect the diversity we had from the spring split.

I like it cuz its way enough dmgto burst a squishy target and not get blown up right after. Its decent pen and resistance to hinder tanks job etc. the more dmg your team has, the more bruiser you should head imo. if you have a Sion and Diana, you really want more Pen, stick in ur backline and help ur carries maybe with a BC instead of SS, note that BC help ur ADC to bring down the tank. If they do have a Sion or Diana, you might like more your crit build and flank them hard when they engage hard on front (even tho i prefer to flank as a bruiser...!

He is powerful enough to help teams to win great midgame fights but if ur team cant close game quicky, olaf becomes quickly weak. Especially in bronze where people gather a ridiculous amount of gold quickly with kills. You are looking for the right answer, the game is about to destroy the nexus. Not to win your lane. Ask my Shen. If you like Olaf style, and looking for a champ who ramps up better and can influence other lanes, i would suggest Garen for you. He is simple and really hard to deal with when he becomes strong quickly, he stays really relevant until late late. Toplane is the least impactful role in the game right now, its hard to transfer your edge and spread it over the map more than any role. It is just less true at low-verylow elo since a matchup can snowball so hard because players lack of knowledge how to act when its happen.

2543,"Support is the most or 2nd-most impactful role on the pace of a game. It is debatable with Jungler. Support/Jungler&gt;mid&gt;top&gt;ADC. You can carry on any role, don't put me wrong. The decisions making from the support or the jungler are the decisions who sets the other players to a favorable or unfavorable scenario. The vision, their roams, their initiation, disengage are all the keys to victory. Unfortunatly, it is common to think ''hyper-carries'' are the picks to climb, it's wrong for 95% of lol player base. As other said, there is ''better'' picks as support than other depending on Elo. The more important thing, it is to understand that you support your TEAM not a fkin ADC only. If you are Silver or lower, well, you should stick to your lane during the laning-phase since ADCs are often too dumb to play it smart if you roam, therefor you better pick a kill-lane support. Respect the ADC style, if he is just farming, dont force trades but you can try to deny farm to the other adc throught your actions, you might win the farm-challenge. Match his skill, don't all-in even in a favorable scenario if you see that he doesnt know what he is doing (i mean dont initiate!), if he is going to fall behind, don't fall behind too, support is useful to the team. Bard is excessively hard to play, very intensive, the good thing about Bard is he can backup his own agression if it turns bad without a direct intervention from your ADC, but well, don't expect early success with the Champ, he is very hard, you may want to start with another agressive type. If you want to climb elo, you *better* play an agressive support (i don't mean agressive on the DAMAGE CHART, agressive on the playstyle!!! Like Trundle, Leona, Taric for example), maybe simpler to play than Bard, Nami and Thresh to begin (practice them on the side in normals as you get better at support).",2016-03-03 14:51:49+00:00,d0m1f4w,1.0,t3_48s4px,2349.0,leagueoflegends

2568,"Mpen, AR, Scaling AP blue, AP quint. 12/18/0. Always start with a full clear, at least the 2nd scruddle too. The first scruddle might be risky to take but i usually take it. Do not gank during your first clearance unless you are absolutly sure to secure a kill. Usually if the opponent is very very low or if he used his flash and you can secure with a flash Q. Buy a sweeper at level 9!!!! this one is the most important, always always have one or two pinks in your inventory ALWAYS. You absolutly need to scan your position when you ult! Unless you are totally sure you are undetected, you shouldnt initiate with your ult, it hurts so much to miss a ult. The best way to do so, it is to scan your entire path of approach until your wanted channeling zone (with the lvl 9 sweeper), and you set a pink at the end, then for a loooonnnng zone you know if you have been seen or not. Usually you want to have another way to initiate, like Leona ult, you start the fight by peeling then you ult in when they forgot about you. I know I know how good it feels to ult into 5 initiation, but the trap is to be obssessed to acheive this everytime, if you do so you miss the real and better way to play fid. At lower elo its easy to be over the closest wall and ult into them, but you will have to be creative later on, because people smart-up and there is nothing more useless than a fiddle trying to flank but the ennemy knows where you are. Very often the best fiddle is the one who stays in the back and peel, it is up to you to identify what role your team needs from you. If you want to ult early in a fight from the backline (u r seen), you better channel away and flash in. Buy Distortion boots, his flash is too valuable! I hope the tips help you.

The wave will push towards you until it hits your turret --&gt; NO MATTER WHAT YOUR OPPONENT DOES. It is VERY useful in certain very unfavorable matchup, like Renekton vs Kennen, or Most of Matchups vs Pantheon, it saves you from taking free dmg early levels, where you only have to sacrifice few CSs and Wait the wave at the turret (well, you better walk in XP range when an ennemy minion is about to die, this safely in range at least). That is ONE example. The other one, it happens more often as a midlaner, Your ennemy midlaner died or is recalling, What do you do? Shoving entirely the wave is the best scenario, but sometimes, you don't have the mana to shove it quickly enough, you want to recall as well ASAP, if the ennemy has 9 minions and you have 5, kill 2 of his minions and recall. The wave will slowly push towards you and it will deny him CS and assure yourself a freeze, the worst is to see your few minions stalled in front of his turret out of turret cannon range, you just gave him a freeze + you have more minions than him on the lane, so you are denying yourself CS while you back. Many specific scenarios can happen. You want control of the lane and the adjacent territories? You have to push. You have an unfavorable matchup or the jungler is threatening you?

Paired with a decent jungler, he (the jungler) can walk in this lane anyday to sweep those 2 flashless botlane ennemies. Trundle agressiveness in lane match very well with the way you should play Lucian. 
- Ashe / Braum. One Braum Q/AA = 100% braum's passiv proc success with Ashe range+slow without any dmg back taken (except Cait, but you are already performing a winning trade if she answers). Braum is also the biggest Ashe counter imo, this duo also deny Braum.

- Graves / Taric for passive synergy, you get so much efficiency out of Taric heal with all Graves resistances from passive + Taric W passive. one stun also gives a free combo. The lane is just too tanky and good burst, the sustain is very good.

2622,"thats right as Shen jungle, i play Shen a lot recently but in the jungle. In the jungle i rely on high CDR and team support items. But as Top, you can easily take the Titanic Hydra route. As i mentionned before, what you need its control as a toplaner, not dmg, not snowball, not Rambo. Its a very high misconcept in lower-elo, people think high dmg = more chance to win. It is not true at all. In fact, well balanced team (mix dmg, tank, dps, burst) have a much higher chance to win with lower skill than their opponents. Taking the less popular role in a team, the tank, off-tank etc, is a very very very valuable asset to your team. If you do it perfectly, you just give the so hated ''feeder'' a chance to be useful in the team and make his impact more positive. You have no idea how many times i have kept poor carry alive and pull out wins that way. If you play on a 5 carry team and (in lower elo) every time one getting caught out, there is no chance to win if you die before you delivered your dmg, 5 carries in a team get single out one by one with no coming back chance if there is mistakes. Top is the second least impactful role on Summoner's rift. Even if you do tons of dmg, du to your map position and the fact you mostly affect only one opponent with all the money you got from snowball, it is very hard to spread your gigantic edge over the map. In other word, the least impactful job you can do of all mentioned is to stomp your opponent, that aint gonna change as much, you are probably missing tons of opportunity to make snowball other lanes or the entire team by focusing on killing ur single opponent. You better just make sure your others lanes win and not become a liability. Carry toplaners are often a liability or not impactful throught victory.",2016-02-19 22:30:38+00:00,d06ez6b,7.0,t1_d06dwkv,1652.0,leagueoflegends

He will have mana issue for a nice combo and keep his ult as jungler. But his gank potential is so high that it balance for his issues.

2626,"Wave control is very important in toplane. You must have the wave on your side when its the right time and push the wave when its the right time. The correct answer is soooo matchup dependant and what jungler you/they have. First identify if you have a favorable matchup or if you don't. If you don't have a good matchup, your teleport becomes your most important tool ever. Since you don't expect to win your lane, you want to look at helping other lane to win and come on yours to help breaking it. As example, Malphite is usually terrible early game, you can look to farm a little bit agressivly at the beginning since you typicly can use your TP for a first back on lane. Then you want to play very passivly to not be kicked out of lane in any circumstances. You are looking to use your second TP botlane, countergank mid lane with TP, Grab a kill with your jungler on your lane or simply push your lane and roam mid with your devastating ult. Without any kind of specific subject or direction you need, TopLane can be detailed on 10 books of 1000 pages. Winning mid or botlane is far more important than winning toplane, it has a lot more impact. If you can work it out to destroy another lane or attract lots of attention on top from jungler/mid without feeding them, you are doing basicly all a team need from a toplaner during laning phase. yes its good to snowball, yes its good to take your opponent turret, the better win is what i said previously.",2016-02-19 21:08:21+00:00,d06bnk9,3.0,t1_d06as81,1226.0,leagueoflegends

RELIABLE CHAMP, no do-or-die, KhaZix for example, if you arent doing well on one game, you better stay at fountain to tell you how useless you became for your team. RELIABLE CHAMP, lots of skillshots champion like Xerath, not a good idea, no offense but if you were mechanicly gifted you wouldnt be B5. MIDGAME POWERSPIKE, typicly in low-elo game the 15minutes marks the bloodbath begins and the kills just go as up as 50 vs 60 kills; you want a champ with good midgame, dont play kassadin... DECENT to Good SCALING, for the same reason as above, low-elo has hard time to close game and it will often go very late unless a team surrend between 20-30 (why pick mid-game powerspike if it goes to lategame all time? because the moral factor is huge at low-elo matches and players dont understand scaling, matches surrend very very often when they shouldnt). Good teamfight champions (not Rengar, not Shaco, not Riven). Who can fit all those criterias? Malphite, Malzahar, Annie, Graves, Amumu, Sejuani, Kennen (a little bit more difficult to learn how to lane), Skarner, Twisted Fate. I might comeback later if other champ come to my mind, there is a lot more. Malphite and Amumu are doing extremely well at low-elo. As last, avoid Assassins, some players will encourage you to play them since ''they carry''... yeah right, Assassins with 30-0-30 KDA, its very hard to close a game with assassins, i really encourage you to pick champ good at teamfights, since its probably the only time your team will be up togheter to take objective after fights. Even if you keep assassinating people left and right, too many times your team wont understand the number advantage and it will result to no objective taken despite your individual play. then, lategame, assassins are terrible at teamfights and taking objectives. I hope you read what you want to hear, but at the end here it is, any champion, anylane can easily make you climb out of bronze.

Again, if you liked to splitpush as Udyr, Nocturn is in good position right now and he is a very good splitpush.

He cannot be played like other ADCs and this is the primary reason why most of them fail. There is a couple smart guy who figured how to use Jhin properly and they have great results. When the correct playstyle will be known it will change Jhin's current state. It would be a pure mistake to buff him right now only to figure out later than the addition of the buff + Everyone learnt how to play Jhin just made a Broken OP recipe. I can be totaly wrong on my Jhin opinion ( if balanced or not).

Also, make sure your jungler isnt an idiot trying to gank on your very first wave built (the 3:00 gank), fighting into 12-15 minions (+surely being lower lvl than panth) IS NOT smart and if you die, your lane is dead, you will get completly stomp, a kill to panth + all the xp/gold of the wave gone.",2016-02-16 15:11:09+00:00,d01xne8,1.0,t3_462o4y,2379.0,leagueoflegends

The biggest change they have done to lux in the past year its to give her more control on her E explosion (before there was a delay before she can trigger the dmg). Her cooldowns on her Q and E are already very long. Nerfing the dmg on a long-range champion is Meh :/ to me. I can only see a nerf on her W to balance her power and being a satisfying nerf to everybody. Either by increasing the mana cost, reducing the duration, lower the AP ration or lower the Shield base numbers.

And right now, the only one who can change the sideline meta is Riot by encouraging (throught buffs) early picks on Herald and/or Dragon or changes to turrets. Taking down turrets is too efficient right now and this won't change, the only thing we ''could'' see, would be a 4men mid if the ennemy would pick a bad waveclear mage, but i didn't see any pick like that lately (Fizz, Kassadin etc...). The depth of the strategies right now is really sharp and well thought, pretty hard to pull a cheese atm since the majority of scenarios are known and the correct response to it is practiced and known.",2016-02-10 15:33:42+00:00,czutcwn,3.0,t1_czualn3,46334.0,leagueoflegends

Yes you can improve your positioning, your ingame decision, but to deliver dmg it all depends on the quality of your team initiation, peeling and disengage. This is also a duo lane, which greatly depend on your support performance aswell. ADC is a fun role to play, enjoy it, but you have to know this isnt a role ""to carry"". Your team will carry you, you can only mess up, you wont be the true hero of all that. A bad adc will drag down the team in the abyss, a good ADC can only ""help"" to win. As low elo players, i would avoid ADC with horrible midgame like Cait and Tristana.

3012,"yep, just to point out HOW to go to mid lane. There is NO point to go to midlane if the jungler head to TOP lane. There is NO point to go midlane if your midlaner is pushed agaisnt his turret. Why? If the midlaner is pushed, by the time you walk there, share the CS (poor midlaner) and reach the turret, you will have to walk back to your turret to not lose it (if you head towards midlane because your mid is pushed, the only reason its to quick gank, if it fails runback to lane, dont chase the kill)! If your jungler is away (fountain/top) its bad to go to midlane, its a very nice setup to be in a nasty position and be stuck in a 4v3 while traveling or simply unlikely that you deliver any dmg to the turret. I just want to point this out because it is often done the wrong way. So YES ITS GOOD TO HEAD TO MIDLANE FOR THE TURRET, make sure you check box those points before to move. If you cant because of those points, take the scruddle, take the krugs, deep ward. Other point, i really hate the early focus on the stupid dragon, it is costly on HP, it takes time to kill, you lose pressure everywhere and put your team at risk. Even after a cleanup early, id rather recall and be back in position as soon as they are back too. The time u do the dragon, you have to recall after, the time you walk back to yourlane, the botlane is already destroying your turret and the you lose CS for a miserable %dmg from drag that you can get later.",2016-01-28 06:23:26+00:00,czev45c,2.0,t1_czev07j,280.0,leagueoflegends

3101,"As jungler, you need to have exceptionnal map awareness. This isnt something you can learn on reddit or watching youtubes. My advices would be limited to this if you want to start the role: 

- Choose a champion with LOW SKILL CAP, could be like Warwick as probably the champion with lowest skill required

- Choose a champion who doesn't rely on snowballing to be relevant, that means, no Kha'Zix, no Evelynn

- Blue ping anytime you see the other jungler passing on wards, red ping any threat, you must use your free time between camps to provide your mates all informations they could have missed because they are busy CSing, harassing etc... MIAs!!!! you have the time to see from wich side the midlaner could have gone mia, ping accordingly.

- Wards!!!! you see the jungler ganking bot while you are clearing top side of the jungle? Well, if he is bot, he probably cleared his own jungle on this side and after the gank he will more likely clear the opposite side, since you can't help bot, go ward his jungle, invade and take camp if its the appropriate time/decision. Your deep ward will prevent next gank on your top or mid. If you choose to clear his camps, its probably a nice occasion to setup a countergank if you have a better 2v2 than them.

- It has been mostly covered on the last point, but DO NOT WASTE TIME. Take good path, recall when it is time, be aware of your buffs timing, of his buff timings. You have to level up asap, you have to gather gold, you have to ward, you have to gank, you have to track the ennemy jungler.

3341,"Yes, when you are for example Gold V, or IV, and you play vs players in the range of Silver II and Gold III. Teamwork is really hard to get, very often inexistant (as a small example of 2 days ago, as Gold IV, i was 12-2-X as Xerath, never been able to siege with the team, wich would had assure a win if they could just sit and let me poke in front of the turret). It's very hard to have constant game with teamwork oriented champ. Better of picking champion who excels on mobility and small skirmishes because people are too often spreadout at the wrong moment, wrong path. I mostly play junglers like Gragas, Sejuani, Amumu, Skarner, Nautilus type. It's very hard to make a team win if you arent far head. When in higher Gold for example, as a teamwork oriented champ, you can sit on who is fed and play around him. People tend to have a little better idea how to deal with a edge. It's far easier too to convince your team to not stick around baron pit vs gangplank and Malphite in same team. Its far easier to create teamplay in higher gold for a player like me. On this matter, yes its way different. On another hand, i have to be a lot more careful on my jungler decisions, i will never get outplayed on my map positioning at low Gold. Another point too, it's far easier to get your role at higher Gold, people tend to make it togheter at champselect.

Seems a perfect scenario, but its as easy as mentionned. Nasus isnt part of the game anymore.

Before morello or athene completed his dmg delivered do not worth the mana you pay for, you cant poke if you dont last hit at same time, if you free cast Qs you will fall behind.(you will be pushed without mana to farm your wave, more cs you loose less mana return from double dorans and things are getting worst). If you farm properly and stay ahead in xp (solo lane), you will kill adcs with 2 Q (better cast one ludens echo Q on him then ult). The bigger difference imo between xerath and ziggs it is, both are poke when sieging and dancing. But once the fight start they are different, ziggs is more of a peel dps and burst, you can hardly hit the backline safely like xerath.

Nautilus is a great support, very good jungler and good top.
Having this one in your pocket your can make it for 3 lanes. 
For mid, my blind pick is Vel'Koz, pretty hard to counter, but be aware this champ is very vulnerable until you perfect your kiting ability, you need to be quick and accurate to punish assassins in lane. 
Great and safe mid picks are usually those with good wave clear. Like Malzahar, Morgana, Vel'koz, Orianna this is all good mid pick if you want to main one since you can Blind pick it no worry. 
If you go into those Katarina, Zed you gotta be on point and seriously good OVERALL in the game, because you must snowball and you must NOT MISS any opportunity to pick out of lane since you might get countered on your lane if you tend to pick it first no matter what.

Jayce is a very good early bully, i've always used TP respecting this power zone i've been playing more starving opponent off CS and pushing him out of lane rather than kill (wich is more extensive on mana ressources), with ignite you need a different setup and trick your opponent out of positiong to deliver a killing burst. It's easier and more safe play to starve him of CS. When you setup a kill without let him go free, you have to put him in a false confort zone, the CS differential will not be stretched as much, you also play with equal level since you don't want to push him, therefor you MUST get the kill. Without a lead it's very hard to play Jayce top. I still can see both being equally viable.",2015-11-23 21:44:26+00:00,cxamaqk,7.0,t1_cxam5o7,197.0,leagueoflegends

More often its support AND adc positioning who gives free time to leona and nautilus because he can walk up free of harassment from both party. You should be able to jump away his ult, to have an idea when he is going to use it and position accordingly. He becomes pretty overwhelming if he grabs a kill no doubt about it, but to grab a kill as nautilus it's not guaranteed if you play against him right. Tristana is a very good adc vs Naut in lane, keep going on.

Make sure you play a champion who can farm even in a bad matchup... There is a lot more in a game than the 15minutes you are stuck facing the same ennemy. Get your Gold for your core items and find yourself a way to be useful for your team. As an example, who cares if you are behind 40 CS in lane with Malphite if you ace the team twice with a good ult. How many time you hear idiots ''who fed katarina, i shltted on her in lane...''. Katarina got fed because she knows how to play even facing a bad matchup. In this Katarina case, she got fed probably because the botlane was so tunnel focused on their laning phase 2v2, they don't understand the game is 5v5 and they ignored your pings.

Don't play Pantheon! Cait could fit in those criterias. But i would recommend Jinx to someone over Cait. Why? Because even at late game people do not use Tristana and Cait range. They don't know how to siege over 2-3 waves, damaging slowly a turret. Those champ can land safely many crits before the fight start. But no one will do this, Jarvan will try an horrible flank, before Cait can ult-harass a good target before the fight and Cait potential goes to garbage. etc... Low-Elo are like 2 Trucks roaming around (roaming around? sorry, i meant, walking down midlane) and then come ''You see me, I see you, let's fight''.

It's quite risky to have it as a pattern, you might miss a good opportinuty because nobody pay attention. What i often do tho, its to pickup the 3 small raptors.
I would do it with VERY good waveclear champ, like Vel'Koz, Ziggs etc...  Since you can push their ENTIRE wave to their turret and have a lot of time to go farm the jungle. You could do this if you starve of CS because of a scary Diana (still, i dont recommend it bcuz while you do this, you will get push to your turret and give free roam to a Diana... ).
