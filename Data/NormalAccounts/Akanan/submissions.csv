This comm tool available de players is just amazing. Most of you knows how to use it and how good it is. I want to share few tips for better communication trought pings.  

- You are the one who retreat or backing off: exemple You are sieging and you decide that is not worth and your team is wasting time, often, people will spam the pu$$y yellow ping. I found the ***""on the way""*** ping is much more efficient. Ping your way out, ping where you are going. Ive started to use this one after i moved my One ping button to my mouse and now its the only ping button im using, i dont use anymore the yellow one. Because using the yellow button doesnt share anykind of useful information to your team on WHY you want them to retreat, ***an information not understood is an information ignored***. If you green ping your way out, people quickly realize they are down one man by now.

- MIA: What is often seen its a ping on top of the lane with a MIA and... Nothing else. Make sure to share any kind of additonal information. Use the MIA ping and make it follow twice or three time on the side where the laner left, blue ping the probable pathing used as they approach the lane, ghost your MIA with your blue ping. That gives very accurate information to your laners. They can assess how many time left they have before to backoff. Use the red ping ON TOP OF THE MIA POSITIONS (NOT on top of your mates) as the MIA gets closer. It is much more efficient than spamming red and yellow on top of your laner, the panic button mixed with an information poorly shared lead to your mates ignoring it. You can also remind on chat summoner and ult timer before the mia reach the lane.

- Blue ping, use it as much possible to SHARE an information, like a ward, a pathing (exemple as 2 you are chasing someone, blue ping your path plan so togheter you can corner better your prey) and especially a MIA who came back to lane.

- Avoid spamming ping for imminent and known situation. Rengar hunting noise with an exclamation point over the head is enough, thx no need to use 3-4 yellow ping on top of it.
- Respect a decision taken by your mates, they are commited, they do not backoff and keep trading, he is the last one and goes ham...? Well, despite multiples ping prior to it, you are not helping anyone by sharing your rage, panic and emotion when you spam pings on top of people's head while they are trading. Take the time to ping information he will be able to use while they fight.

I'm a long-range mage fan. With all the buffs on Ziggs in the past months i'm back playing him. Since i prefer Meditation mastery on Ziggs most of the time, it leaves me open choice on the Mana Regen item (with Xerath i really really look to have Athene). I wonder if FQC is the ideal item for Ziggs. I currently look for Athene most of the time, along with Meditation, it allows me to spam Q infinitly over and over. If it is Xerath, Vel'koz or Ziggs, i'm not really spending on CDR, i prefer devastating skillshots, so the 10% instead of 20 doesnt really bother me. Later in the build i often go Lichbane which would give me a usual 20%. I use AP, AP18 or MR blues. If somes wonder why i prefer meditation on Ziggs and not Xerath, it's only because of the playstyle, Ziggs can be a pest and impose his will on most of matchups and i want mana to do this, with Xerath, i harass yes but my goal is to farm.",leagueoflegends,Ziggs Mana Regen item,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/484ek6/ziggs_mana_regen_item/

If the botlane is doing pretty good, ill emphasize dmg before buying any boots. If im doing very good, ill go boots first. Its pretty simple but often disregard. Why? if your botlane is doing well, the support will roam a little bit more, and might come midlane with the adc to destroy the first turret. In the opposite, if you are the one pressuring the midlane hard, you will be the first one moving to sidelanes to help them out destroying the turret.

Id like to have a discussion about my champs here, even if i have spammed them so much lately, i would like to hear from different opinions when would you prefer to pick one more than the other. I've always picked Vel'Koz if blind picked. This guys has no true counter other than Leblanc. Seriously any other counter are just soft counter and i can still make my way out of the laning phase easy. During the pre-season i brought up Lulu in the line up, and i seriously love this champion, she is just unbeatable, but i prefer Vel'Koz overall, he has a greater indivdual impact. 

- Here comes Xerath, I'm really good with the champion but i always have the ''ish''! should i pick him over Vel'Koz??? aaarrrrfffff, lock Vel'Koz. I would like to be able to identify easily when is the proper situation/comps to dominate a game with Xerath. Roughly, you want to be able to farm ur laning phase and make sure your team has the potential to hold on for the lategame in best case scenario. I found him better when we have a tank who disrupt and mess a lot with the other team, Volibear for example.

Riven top, Yi jungle and Leblanc mid are the type of comps i can see pretty often. I don't see any reason to add ''more dmg'' and i'd rather oppress their carry and be tankier.

- When played right, Urgot is very strong in lane and makes midgame carnages. He falls off hard tho, make sure you have a good scaling comp.",leagueoflegends,I like ADC Urgot.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3r8efa/i_like_adc_urgot/
