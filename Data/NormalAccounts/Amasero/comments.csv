Eto was on top of the food chain in part 1.

In :RE everyone else that mattered caught up in power/went above her.

Haise/Ken: Trained by Arima for over 2years, Genius fighter, and the moment he woke up as Ken. He could have killed Eto, simply because the power gap was already closed. Plus Rize Kagune=OP

Furuta: Rize Kagune is OP, and he used his Garden Training.

Also, Eto's role in :RE was to setup everything for the next king.

During the two year skip, she started writing her book, moved Aogiri to the final Island/Battle spot,  helped produce OneEyes, helped kill Haise to bring back Ken, and then planned until the Candidate vs King battle came.

She also helped Ken's friends escaped/survive because he needs a following/body guards. 

I enjoyed Eto's role in :RE, we barely saw her in Part 1, She appeared a decent amount in :RE.

And her presence was great. I can't complain, if she is alive I wouldn't mind it, if she is dead then I still wouldn't mind it.

You have to blame the other 3. Not the adc, but Top, Mid, and Support.  For not even picking 1 CC champ.

Because what if that Khaz can't play Amumu, or Hec? That's pretty much the two hard CC junglers. (Ofc other picks like Malphite, Sion, Wu.)

Maybe he just wanted that early game win?

Compare to a Singed who is letting his Adc 1v2. Which forces that adc to miss CS, level, slower scaling. 

If you have ever played Adc with a Merle support vs a poke/ Ap bot. Then you should know.

What is singed going to do vs a Morg? Nothing which makes it a 1v2. No sightstone either?  You have more gold spent from the adc to buy pinks. Slower scaling again. Or they can go with no vision, and play extremely scared. Then they lose CS because of lane reset.

No vision? You can't even step out of tower really for that CS. You know why? Because you have a Singed support that is applying no pressure in lane, or wards. He deserves the ban.",2016-11-15 16:53:58+00:00,da1g0m1,4.0,t1_da1a611,7697.0,leagueoflegends

What smart investor would do that? Unless they want to build a brand in other sports, and joined League because it's the most popular.

&gt; I dont want to watch a league where the only thing that matters is the top 1-4 teams. Both for the narrative aspect and the aspect of grading value (i most certainly dont want the last 3-4 weeks to be filled with meaningless matches, especially when currently the last weeks are usually the most exciting)

Then they can still keep relegation. They would just need to add something for the other teams to do.

You're reasoning is you want to see ""try hard"" matches at the last 1-2 weeks. That's your reasoning on why you don't want relegations. 

That's something that can be fixed by adding some other type of reward to 4-last teams. That they have to fight over for it. That's the simple fix to your relegation problems.

It's a girl pretending to be a guy. Now she has no problems telling people it looks like, unless it wasn't just to Saiko. But if you were smart enough in the story, the character should themselves figured it out already.

Saiko will most likely start to  notice the Shady shit going on, just like Amon in pt1.

Ken vs Furuta, I think this is a trap. We saw Aura Hige patrolling the streets, I think they will run into Haise.

It's the same character so the same ability would have transfer over. After that it would be up to Haise to use that ability, in which he didn't do.

But it does come down to personality, and Haise did not want to fight, it was written in his personality.",2016-11-05 13:33:19+00:00,d9mtj4a,3.0,t1_d9mmtus,23342.0,TokyoGhoul

You can watch the first season of TG. It does a good job with Kens character development, it wasn't perfect but it did that job.

It gives you an Idea of how the CCG looks evil, and how Ghouls look Evil.

After that don't even bother with season 2.

Now this is your choice.

If you want to read the first season then read from chapter 1.

If you want to skip all the 49 chapters of set up/explaining/information pour on how they world works.

Then I suggest starting at 50. (If you are decently smart/good reading comp.)

You don't miss really anything if you watch s1, then read from 50-current.

You will miss one thing called ""RC gate"" but that comes back THREE times in :re, and each time it is explained. So if you do decide to start at 50, you will miss the RC gate part.

But it gets explained 3 times In perfect detail, so it's all good.

I do enjoy the words, and that one panel they showed of Ken. Amon is a true bro, and I hope Saiko joins him, which will eventually lead her to Ken.

Also it looks like Ken will have new people under him.

712,"I believe he is a live.

I believe he is working with Uta. 

On chapter 30.1 or 31.1 someone sent Haise the sign book that only Hide had, plus he knew Haise location. 

We know that Hide likes to put trackers on people.

Now I believe mask 86 was Hide, until the prison raid. Why? When the Urie+Tooru were investigating using their Ghoul mask. They found the 86 ghoul with blonde hair. Fast forward to Prison raid, and we see the 86 mask with black hair when the raid starts.

Something must have happen, and the way Uta's face looks when Haise mentions the book to him. 

Idk I just think he is a live, and is working with the clowns.  Since multiple people in this series have notice how dangerous Hide is.

Akira, Maru, Nishi, Ken.

Plus that play that Ken+Hide were in was mentioned TWICE in the story. Plus in that story Ken is wearing a cape with the Aogiri symbol on the back, he was the ""Hero"" in the story.

Another thing is Hide knew about the RC Gates, and told Maru about it. I believe he told Maru when Eto's new book came out. Since it did say ""A lot of CCG members have lost trust in the Washu's"" 

We know Hide told Maru, because Maru said ""Hide you were right..."" well he didn't say Hide he used his last name I believe.

So the man is prob trolling some where, giving Ayato security cards so they can cause a mess, so Ken won't have to 1vCCG during his great plan.

Hide knows everything Ken is going to do. The man is dangerous.",2016-09-30 14:35:48+00:00,d88bpor,1.0,t3_5566g1,38448.0,TokyoGhoul

""The bodily capabilities can increase as much as the number of vessel increases. Vessel growth and spread throughout the body is stimulated through repeated injury and regeneration. Through this process, half-ghouls and quinx become stronger to the degree they're hurt.""

&gt; Takizawa didnt even break out his mask when he was mopping the floor with sasaki. Heck, he even had time to play with him.

?????? He couldn't control it back then....plus he did use it after Hinami came in, but he wasn't a completed Kakuja.

Plus let's be real, who didn't beat Haise. Haise lost 80% of his fights, until Ken had to ""step in"". The only fight he won was vs the two other white suits, and I guess Shu? But he only beat Shu because he knew what Shu was going to do/his battle style. 

Karren beat his ass.
Taki beat his ass.
Nishi beat his ass.
Eto pimped slapped him. 

So it's not really impressive, even Eto said ""My dear Haise, you really like taking a hit"" the man did not know what the word Dodge meant. 

I don't think it's ass pulling.

Do you remember how Haise/Ken duo stopped Taki? By stabbing him once. Then bam Taki was out for a bit. One stab, that's it. That's all it took to stop Taki in his tracks for a bit.

So getting kicked in the nuts, by another ghoul would hurt. It's the most sensitive area, same way how Taki punching+kicking Hakatori in the Vag hurt Hakatori.

Then getting your balls+ PENIS crushed/stomped on. Would fucking hurt. He clearly didn't die to it.

Takizawa is an Ukaku type. Do you know what that means? It means the longer the fights, the weaker he becomes.

He has fought Tatara, Hakatori, Hoji+Akira+CCG minions, Amon, and now Tooru.

Fighting dirty can close the gap, do you know why? Because Takizawa was in Kakuja mode while fighting Tatara.

I do not see a Kakuja mask while he was fighting Tooru. Do you? So clearly he isn't using his full power. Maybe he can't spam his Kakuja mode. So we know he isn't at max power.

He got outplayed, idk about wrecked. The man still had Kakuja mode in his hand, the man clearly looked fine when Akira took the hit for him. He was smiling during the whole chapter. He was messing around at first, didn't expect blood+spit in his eyes, or a GHOUL kick to the nuts+crushing it.

It means time has past, and Eto just now told Ayato to kill Floppy, but this means Floppy has been becoming a thorn on Aogiri's side. Meaning someone is hiding the truth.

Yes Arima really did cooperate with ghouls behind the CCGS back. The man has always been trying to die, which is why he hunted down top ghouls so he can have his chance of dying. 

EX: The reason why he went after Touka's mom, because she was one of the strongest ghouls at that time.

Arima did not work with ghouls to ""maintain this balanced"" He wanted to break that balance that V has, by making/finding a successor. 

CCG was not aware, which is why Furuta went to hells length to try find the King, but towards the end he must have found out that Arima was king, and now Ken is king and he 100% knows.

Arima spared Eto after Eto told him her plan after he hunted her down to fight.
Eto and Arima worked together secretly after that.

Since Tatara was Eto's left hand man, and Noro was Eto's right hand. They both knew who the King was. (Seeing how Ayato had no clue about the ""King"")

At one point Bleach was my #1 manga to read, next to Naruto, Gantz, and then One Piece.

It was a good ride Kubo. A little speed bumps a long the way, like fullbringer arc being way 2 long, and how the first half of the 1000 year war went on to long, or how some fights just didn't get resolved (KIRA?????????????) 

But I enjoyed the last two chapters, because if I could list your strongest points in this series.

Number one would be character interactions. Only thing I liked about fullbringer arc was the high school Ichigo interaction with everyone. Kubo just do slice of life.

Anyways the last two chapters idk about you guys, I don't like how it was ended, but I enjoyed the last two chapters.
I can already tell that Ichigo's son has fucking Orihimes personality outside of fighting, and honestly I think I like that.

Make a sequel, fuck Jump, do your own thing, people will read. 

8/10 the Series. 13 years of reading boys, Naruto ended on me, but I still got shitty Boruto.

Then Taki came, and redirected the blast away from Hoji. Why? Look at positioning of Hoji+Tatara. They are directly facing each other face to face.

I enjoyed it. I liked the first 20-30minutes, I liked Diablo ALOT, Will Smith did amazing, Robbie did amazing.

FUCKING JAI DID amazing. He really humanized Captain Boomarang. 
But 100% Diablo takes it all, his character development, his last fight scene was sick. I do not know much about Diablo, but man what a good surprise. 

The Joker was hit/miss on the little scenes we had of him. I really like when he was talking to the Chief of Security. That was a good scene from the Joker. Also, when he was spraying his AK+Laughing. That 100% reminded me of the Joker, but some parts were a little ummm to much? To much pyscho.

I loved Enchantress to the point that I can look past her Tension Boogie Woogie dancing. When she was inside the mirror, and slammed that guys head in. I thought it was cool. When she transformed at the end to pure black. That was a badass moment.

The best scene I must say, was the Bar scene. 

Harley was 10/10. She called everyone a pussy, just like Harley would.

I didn't see pacing issues tbh. A lot of shitty cuts, but I know WB edited out a lot of stuff. 

The fight scenes were ok. I really liked Enchantress's brother, when they first show him in his like Bio Suit?. But you can clearly tell they were not hitting shit/swinging at the air.

If this movie was rated R, the fight scenes would have felt a lot more realistic.

Oh I can't forget the OG Amanda. She did great. I didn't like how she came at the end all nice, and clean. Like lady, did you take a shower+changed clothes or what?

TL;DR:

Will Smith did amazing.

Harley was amazing.

Diablo was surprisingly good.

Jai didn't suck, he humanized Captain Boom.

Killer Croc had some nice one liners.

Enchantress was badass in her dark form, the god mode is....questionable.

Joker hit/miss at certain scenes. 

Shitty cuts/transition, but not as bad as BvS imo.

You can clearly tell how fake the fighting was between humans. 

Movie should have been rated R.

I give this movie a 7.8/10. I would watch again, and I am 100% sure the Blueray version is going to be better.

Also did Eto die?

If Ken now says he is the OEK is he going to start killing humans or what...cause I'm still waiting for that.

edit: Don papa said he was going to go meet the king. I think...the clowns. The REAL clowns. Not Furuta, but Uta+DonPapa+Nico etc. Are all going to be on Ken's side.

And we know how Ishida loves to work now.

So I am assuming that Rize has been eating, a lot. To get stronger or to heal any battle wounds.

Why would she have battle wounds? Well we learned that V was chasing after Rize for a while in the story of :RE. The only reason they didn't capture her, is because of Shachi.

He left Aogiri. Tatara confirmed it. He must have left to go protect Rize. Which is why V took him out first. Because he was luring them away from Rize, protecting her etc.

So now that Shachi is dead now. Rize prob has only herself vs V+CCG. 

Now her goal? I don't know. If I was Rize I would go after Kanou before I went after V. No point in her going after V now. She spent her like childhood-teen-adult life ignoring them / always on the move.  Why would she fight them now?

So this leaves Kanou, and Kanou only. Kanou captured her, used her against her will. She most likely has a huge grudge on him+Furuta. She must have known it was Furuta by how she said ""Why"".

Anyways, next Arc is most likely going to be about Clowns(Like a small 20 chapter arc) which will tie in Rize to team up with Kenny. Then after that Rize will also give info on V to Kenny, help him enter V's lair, by the same way Rize escaped.

1720,"You guys didn't listen to Nishi wise words.

""That man is to dangerous"" 

Yes hide is one dangerous mother fucker. Not only because of his detective skills.

I hope you guys realize that Hide is not saying who he really is.

* He got kicked by a full ghoul, with a full powerful kick, hit a wall on impact.

Ishida has shown that humans are fragile vs ghouls, yet the mother fucker was playing possum. Clearly something is not right with him at that point.

* Hide is the witches assistance in the play that Ken did. This play was brought up twice in the series. Ken played the Hero, and Hide was the witch assistance. 

* He let himself get caught. Yes, he told the CCG information about Aogiri's location. He knew they had the technolgy to track him down. They weren't going to do it asap, because you raid &gt; informant at that time.

So he joined the CCG ranks, made his name known with most people in the 20th ward building, so they would let him with the investigations, which later on lead to him being friendly with Maru.

* Hide 100% knows about V, Hide 100% knows about people being bred.

You guys know Hide has a lying habit right? When he saw Ken underground, he said ""I want to help you."" while touching his cheek. He lied.
But, I do believe he did want to help Ken, but he also wanted him to be trained/raised by Arima to take out the Washu's/V. 

And as of right now, Hide is mask 86, and I bet him saying he needed ghoul clothing was a false statement to,get close to Aogiri.

* Also, fun golden token. Hide also was trying to cover up Kens missing poster around campus. He kept putting those festival ones over the Ken missing posters. Why would a best friend do this? Clearly he had a plan to ""save"" Kenny.

Hide is not telling the whole picture, Hide is dangerous, but still Hide is a bro in his own way.

This makes my theory have a lot more light.

Rize is going to team up with Ken to take out the V side, while Ken + his crew takes out the Washuu's.

The final boss is going to be the old man Washuu. The demon himself.

And i'm pretty sure we all know why Arima was always fighting top ghouls before. So his chances of death were higher. Which is why he went after Touka's mom. She was a strong ghoul back then.

So now Ken has to go after the Washuu's, and will have to fight the old man.
His crew will most likely be Amon, Rize, Eto...and prob Uta+ couple more.

Rize will deal with the other V members like Kaiko, with Eto. (If Eto lives)

Urie has a spy in his group, and he will not stick with the CCG after he learns all this shit from either Ken himself, or news breaks out.

You aren't seeing the bigger picture. If Furuta+Kenny+Kurona are this strong, what does that say about Rize?

Everyone is getting stronger besides the top dogs. 

Arima been the same.

Eto been the same.

He acts like he knows everything, because he knows everything. 

Eto acted the same way through out the series, she kept ""planning"" shit, then predicting everything, yet That's ok? lol. This double standard is pretty real tbh.

Furuta will get his day of death. Eto owes Ken, and Furuta her life for letting her live.

Rize knows a clown dropped the beams, she must also know Kanou was harvesting her. Ofc she will want Revenge.

Ken will most likely again hunt down the Clowns. Instead of going to Itori, he will go to Uta, now idk if Uta will side with him. I assume he will, since Ken is his ""special"" customer.

In part 1, Kanou released failed experiments to fight Ken.
This time he will have a good amount of real one eye's. Imo, including Shirazu. 

This would also most likely team Rize with Ken, for support.

 Then once the Clown/Kanou arc is over.

The Final arc will be V/Washuu arc. 

Which is why the arc before has to tie in Rize.

Ken will fight the old man Washuu. No way that man is pure human, I do not believe it. Rize will deal with V, with other members like Banjou etc to back her up.

Every manga to anime adaption is terrible. Terrible pacing is always a given.

Look at my Hero Acad. Idc what anyone says, for a 12 ep season. The first 1-6episodes the pacing made me ZZZZZZZZZZZ

Only a handful are good.

FMA:BH is a great example.

edit: This is why when I see my favorite manga's get adapted, I just hate it.

I remember reading when TG was getting, and anime. I was like ""Welp, I bet the art, and pacing is going to be shit. Plus will censor it.""

Then I saw this [guy] (http://65.media.tumblr.com/dc4aac03cd96391f831d7368f37b1dfb/tumblr_inline_n98c8vZuHb1r63xx7.png) and was like yep...doesn't even look like him...

He didn't want to save Eto, he stated why does he need to save trash like her.

But he needed a really good reason for guarding the prison. Since the objective of CCG since the start of RE. Has been destroying Aogiri.

So he got the leader of the group. Forced the CCG to changed plans, and set Arima to guard Eto/Prison.  

This would also put Ken in Cochlea or w.e, he would be able to save Hinami.

Also remember his plan was to die right after, he did not take account Touka,Ayato etc. His plan was to die, so save Hinami. Then Die to Arima. Then also putting the Pyscho women behind bars, so she can't go do Pyscho killing/torture.

Then while he is trying to win, all I saw was others in game trolling him. You know what he did? He muted, and kept playing. Unless it was a total lost ofc.

Like I said, he already been punished for his ""past"" things, but getting those accounts permed. That was his punishment which was served with justice, and I 100% agree with them. But this account like the baddest thing/said would have left any other play a chat bann. 

Also you can't really bring up court charges/drug etc. Two totally different ""theme""/scenario.

I am honestly sad that I might not see him play league again. I already lost Dunkey for typing the same thing Tyler1 basically types.

I think the whole reason for this fight, is for Ken to stop showing Mercy to anyone, I think that's Arima's goal, or one of his goals.

Is so Ken/Haise stops becoming ""soft"", just how this whole series we seen Haise/Ken labeled ""Soft"" by other CCG members. That he cares about ghouls, that he still thinks like a ghoul etc.

I suggest start at 50, it's when Banjou goes talks to Kenny.  The anime butchers the Aogiri arc, so read at 50 if you just want to skip the baby development/information about the world, and how shit works.

2711,"o.o I'm not hostile. Im just letting you know. Idk why people keep saying that.

Well, I don't believe Furuta is dead because I never seen a confirmed kill. All I saw a man get impelled, then he starts writing something. We saw him heal his tooth after railing it back in. We know he was bred like Rize, and Rize has some EXTREMELY good regen, that even other ghouls are shocked. So I assume that mother fucker is walking around atm.

Shachi is dead. V wanted him dead, so they sent Arima, and Arima is Arima. The man was about to kill Yomo, Ayato. So I doubt Shachi meant anything to him.

They state ""Go deal with the Rize thing"" they sent multiple V agents to kill Shachi, but he kept escaping, so they sent Arima. Which is why people believe he is dead, because they stated we want him dead.

Eto getting cut in half wasn't a corpse...we saw her talking, we have seen her Regen powers. Which is why we knew Eto was not dead at all. 

EX: Noro. Taki. Karren.

Kaneki WOULD have died. 100%, if they didn't treat him/kept him in the prison. I am pretty sure they helped heal Ken. To a certain degree.

Again, I never saw Aratas corpse, I never saw him ""die"", nothing.

The reason why people think he is a live, is simply because there is like 2342342424 Arata Armor. So he has to be somewhere being farmed.


I can name characters who I don't think ""died"".

Hide, and Karren.

No such thing.

You are just lead to believe, because you don't know the #1 rule of anime/manga.

If you do not see the corpse/ confirm kill. Then they are not dead.

If Yomo didn't save Rize tbh, she would be dead.

Also, Yoshimura is dead. Even if they ""Save"" him he cannot recover. That's the state Rize would have been if she wasn't saved by Yomo.

Again. We never saw Amon die, we never saw Taki die.

The CCG is most likely going to kill most of the ghouls on Rhue Island. The top dogs, the leaders etc.

While the Prison raid. The ghouls will most likely kill the top Dog/free people.

Arima's death. Eto being freed, Don being freed.

I bet the guy Ken freed that looked like Arata has a job from Ken.

I bet Ken told this guy to go free people.

Remember when they said ""all squads gate 3 has been open! I repeat!"" It was him who opened Gate 3.

Which made the Warden shut down all security/id cards. Which is why Ayato couldn't open the door with his card.

Ex: Ayato, Yomo. 

If Yomo didn't save Ayato then he would be dead atm. 

If Ken didn't save Yomo. Then he would be dead atm.

If they are a threat to V/CCG then they will most likely have to face Death.

Some may enjoy the I'm assuming spin off Jojo Anime (This season) while I would not, because I never got into Jojo.

This might not be popular opinion, I really don't care, but to me. Since I been watching anime in my teens, and now I am 22. I already seen it all.

I already seen studio's fucking up the anime, I already fan service anime, I already seen Girls band anime, I already Harem anime, I already seen the stupid MC is so blind to love anime, I already seen the bad ass anime, I already seen it bro.

First 6. Garbage for my standards.

Next 6. New Sailor Moon? Y.
Last song looks decent.

Boku no Hero great manga series, and the trailer makes it look promising. I would love to see things animated. But I will only watch it to compare it to the manga.

Other then that, everything else is meh.

Next 6. Garbage.

Next 6. Another Gundam.

Next 6. Kiznaviar&amp;Kabanari looks appealing to the mass, but Kabanari looks more interesting for me.

Next 6. Sinbad doesn't need an anime, they should have done the third part of Magi tbh. 

Everything else fan service/girl shit.

Next 6. Sousei finally got it's anime, but it's done by Studio Pierrot so chances of it being good is -10.

Next 6: Gai looks like the only good one.

I believe that's 48 anime, and only a handful are watchable, for me at least.

Also when Nishi kicked the shit out of Hide. The man hit like wood planks at a pretty high speed. Plus the power of Nishi kick must have hurt. Yet the man was fine, and pretended to be passed out.

1. Who sent the book, that only Hide had.

2. How does he know of Haise location?

I understand how Uta sent the mask. Since he is Has Shouta in the clown group.

Only way Hide would send that book is if he hacked the CCG, or he has a tracker on Ken.

The tracker one makes sense, since he also found Ken underground in part 1.

Ken told Touka to eat him, and all she did was take a bite from his trap. Then bam she was Gucci.

Not saying a small piece would heal that hole, it was most likely a limb.

But like I said, we will most likely find out more about Hides past later in the series. Since he has a lying habit just like Ken. And has lied plenty of times in this series.

Also he is dangerous/more then meets the eyes it has been set in stone since the early chapters. That this kid is not normal.

But that's my piece of mind, like I said we will find out later in the series what has happen to him.


edit: There is also a rule I live by, when it comes to manga/stories. That I am pretty sure many others also live by.

If we do not see the corpse of ""x"" person. Then they are not dead.

It has happen so many times in TG, that it's sad people can't understand this.

In TG we were lead to believe Rize was dead. But we saw no corpse, no confirmation on kill, guess what happen during Kanou's arc? Oh look it's Rize.

Takizawa, got half his Torso eaten, we saw no corpse, no confirmation on kill, guess what happen. Oh look it's Takizawa aka Pine-apple-kun.

Saiko is going to get eaten. We already seen plenty, plenty of times where Saiko almost died, by someone trying to eat her.

Ex: Rio, and Noro.

If Urie turns into a full fledge ghoul, then the parallel between him and Ken would be. Ken was able to survive being turned into a ghoul, while Urie was not.(Can't really tell with out seeing it.)

As long as Torso was still a live, this was going to happen. If Nishi didn't disrupt the Q's while they cornered Torso this would have never had happend.

But he lived, he tasted/saw a pray he has never seen.

This is the result of a insane ghoul. That's simply why. As long as he was still a live, the chances of Tooru torture was still up in the air.

You shouldn't compare it to Kens.

Ken got tortured after meeting Yamori for like a couple of hours. No one knew he was going to get tortured by him.

Tooru has had the flag since chapter 6. Like I said, meaning as long as Torso is a live the torture chances were high. It was just bound to happend.

It's black ink. Remember people, this is inside his head. At one panel you see him have some blood stains on his face. Just some, next panel you see it flowing out of control. It's not blood, it's black ink. It's the black in his hair taking over.

Look at his hair. His hair starts off the top being black, then the bottom half is white. Then it is slowly changing to black, with only basically 15% of it being white (the tips) that's because of the black ink that flows out in the next panel. Which makes his hair 98% black.

Let's say Eto is a boxer. Eto is toying with her opponent(Ken), and Eto 
stops trying mid fight, because she has been beating Ken. Eto drops her guard set, and Ken, who is heavily damage, K/O's Eto in one punch.

Who won the fight?

Everyone in the audience knows Eto stopped trying, and started toying around.

Yet, who got the W?

Same exact thing happen. I am going by the last fight they had, and Ken came out with the Win. Until they fight again, Ken holds the championship belt.

Same with Arima vs Ken. Arima beat Ken, he has the belt. Same with Amon vs Ken. Ken beat Amon so he has the belt.

Same with Teen Arima vs Owl. Teen Arima made Owl Run away, who won? Arima. So Arima has the belt.

And my god, it knocks most of these books out of the water. Like it was fucking gold. The author can play with your emotions, take on you a ride, give you deaths you do not expect. Gives you twist you REALLY do not expect. Like you would never guess it.

He foreshadows like a mother. You just gotta see the clues. He also adds a lot, a lot, a lot of symbolism.

It's like Game of Thrones. No character is safe from death. No character is safe.

If you think Touka is stronger then Haise, then I might agree with you. Haise loves taking hits, and Touka is a speed type.

Seidou wrecked, fucking wrecked a whole squad of what 8 people? With one Associate Special class.

Seidou could have killed Haise 100%.

Seidou would have killed Hina, but he stopped himself (Kinda).

Then we look at Touka in TG. She had no will to get stronger by the end of TG. She was basically forced out of the ghoul world, by Ken.
Her resolution at the end of TG is waiting, and putting faith that Ken comes back to her.

Now let's look at all her fights.

She lost to Mado, and would have died.

She did win vs Shu, only because she ate a piece of Ken. But i'll give her the W.

She got destroyed by Ayato. The man wasn't even trying.

I just didn't find her torture relatable.

With Ken you can feel his pain, and relate. This is a kid, who went from human to ghoul because of a mistake. Now this kid is being tortured because of that mistake. Which made him lose parts of his sanity.

Yamori was just a ghoul, who got sent to jail. And was tortured for fun. Like hard torture. You saw the fear, the emotion in his face, and thrill. 

Taka we don't know anything, besides hints that he ate his mother. If I was forced to eat my mother, like I would be fucked up like Taka is now.

With Karren it's just Eto implanted the motive, and power to fight Haise.
That's really it. Can you relate to that? I can't. 

Yet none of you guys, can respect opinions lol.

Same way how I didn't hate, or ""LOVE"" Urie, like most of you guys do. The same people who shitted on his life from chapter 2-Now.

Also, What ties does Kanou even have with Aogiri? 

Nothing really, besides shelter, and body supplies.

He only agreed to go with them because his status in the human world is basically gone. Aogiri were searching for Kanou so that they can ask or by **Force** make him join them.

Clearly he agreed to work for them. But what stops them from killing him off once they are done? Nothing. So this means he has to have another partner, a partner he had a long time.

Aka the clowns.

Aogiri were looking for Kanou, during the Aogiri raid. 

Who was there? Nico. 

Who is Nico working for? The Clowns.

We seen two confirmations of Nico's trait. High recovery, and extremely good hearing.

Why wouldn't you send the guy who has amazing hearing into the ""enemies"" base?

Now you can say, Nico was only there for Yamori blah blah blah.

They met at a club people. You really think Nico didn't have this all planned? We seen Nico+ BestGirlRoma, at a club. Knowing Haise was going to be there. Knowing. They knew. 

Another example is, Kanou needed a Q so they can analyze the surgery. 

How did Furuta know Kanou needed one? Because Furutas boss is partners with Kanou. 

I don't think Eto has a cell phone, or Ayato, or Tatara, or Taki.

That can happen to Eto. She can die, but also be important in the ""V""/24th ward arc like Noro is going to be.

And if this arc is a parallel. Then we might see a full on Eto flash back, of her being raised. Which will be amazing. I would love to see what happen to that innocent baby, to turn so twisted. To even make the guy who watched over you, into basically 10%skin, 90% bones.

If Law was not in this arc. If it was just a Luffy vs Doffy. Luff would have 100% won. If Gear 4 is an evolved form of Gear2+Gear3. Then that means he has every single ""skill"" from his basic form.

Gatling, stomp, etc etc. Just different names. 

Ex: Kong Gun - Jet Pistol  Jet Stomp - Rhino Something (Forgot the name)  Jet Bazooka - Leo Bazooka

Meaning this man didn't even use his full skill list vs Doffy.

He could have just Kong Gun Gatling. I personally believe Kong Gun Gatling 
alone would have defeated Doffy. But from an author's point of view, that would just piss people off if it ended that easy.

If Luffy didn't jerk around at the start of the fight. Just went gear 4, and let everything loose. 100% that fight would have ended with out Law being super Fatigued/dying like 10times.

3822,"You know what I do when I play Raka? I don't play for lane, I play for team fights.

Gold flow on Raka is a joke. You get gold from bounty now, and by the end of the game you should have 20-30assist. Which if I remember, assist also gives gold. Dying minion gives you a great amount of gold with the 3 gold per aa mastery.

If you don't play like a silver player, and don't extend lane. Don't pass first bush once everyone hits 6, and make your adc also buy a pink. Then you should be fine.

First death, they are clearly over extending like a mother. She didn't dodge cum shot. That was her adc's fault for extending hard, which got her killed.

Second death, Pan ganked. If you are vsing a Pan, you do not push to enemy tower. Because that happens. 100% bot lanes fault.

Third death, oh didn't learn their lesson with Pan. 

Fourth death, got caught warding. Not her fault really.

Fifth death. She went top to go save Riven? She's level 9 trying to save Riven vs three level 12's. Her fault for not staying with Vayne, until they catch up.

Sixth death, they have the whole blue side warded, I don't know how you path into Malphite, either way Pan was going to ult in.

100% their fault.

7th death. Didn't Q before healing a Eve with 45% hp vs a Tank malphite. Her Hp was not dropping fast, could have healed after Q.

100% her fault.

8th death. Got 1 shotted by Cait, but she has a locket for god knows why. By this time, she would have been tanky, and had good amount of hp.

Can't put the blame on her since I didn't see the whole thing.

9th death: Baron throw. 

They have a diving comp, yet you get an ancient coin first. Makes no sense. Fuck your adc. When you play Raka, YOU ARE THE CARRY. Protect yourself with items. While you just sit in the back, and heal everyone.

I got in trouble in class, so my teacher moved me away from everyone. I was basically sitting on the side, facing everyone. It was weird.

Next thing I know my friend pulls down her shirt/bra, and she turns towards me, with her beautiful tits.

This wasn't the first time.

One week later, I was sitting in back of my history class. She walks in with her friends. Next thing I know, her friend lifts up her like tight skirt? And I just see an amazing soccer ass, where she can't even pull down the skirt because her ass was to big for it.

That week, I got a blowjob, titty fuck, and made out with her multiple times that year.

You really think full power Smoker can take on Doflamingo? No way lol. He was the Balista of Punk Hazard. Haki strings awaken vs Smoke. If you expand your body with smoke, Doffy can just cut it with his Haki strings. Doffy's reactions a lone would be a hard feat to land hits. The man was able to point blank add Haki to his face when Luffy gear 4 super speed kicked him in the face.

Radio knife on a logia is nothing? He wouldn't be able to use his power. Aka a sitting duck. Smoker is  logia who depends on his devil fruit. I never seen him do Soru or anything. Law beat him with easy, and even out smarted him with rocks.

Just look at Blackbeard. Luffy already got smashed into the ground.

Look how much ""pain"" BB took, look how out of breath he is from one punch. BB looks like he can only take 2more punches before he gets knocked out.

I know he is durable, he is one of the most durable villain we have seen(Current most durable is Doflamingo.)  But this was an enraged Luffy. We all know how physically strong he is. We all know how fast he is. If that fight played out, in my own opinion, Luffy would have won, but he wouldn't had been able to escape impel.

Also, this was after Luffy almost died to the poision, he has been fighting in impel down this whole time, (I believe 1 day rest?) he took Ivan's stamina boost just to be able to escape. This man has gone through some shit, before getting to BB. 

Regardless of all that, I still strongly believe Luffy would have won.

Of course they announce Scarlet was the mother, but no one knew about the father. So I assume when this was announced, Kyros quickly started the rumors.

edit: Also here are some of the similarities/opposites of Alabasta.

* Marines didn't raid the palace in Alabasta, because the king didn't permit it, and Smoker didn't want to deal with it.  The marines are raiding Riku's palace, and Fujitora will take all the responsibility of his actions.

* Vivi was a princess turned fighter returned as princess, and decided to leave her fighting life for her Country/Dad.
Rebecca is a princess turned fighter, returned as princess, and now has a decision to leave her country to live with her Dad.

* Crocodile was the ground/land warlord dictator, who ran a secret organization/plans behind the scenes.
 Doflamingo is the sky warlord/ dictator, who publicly was a king, and ran the underground market.

* Smoker's report was covered up. Fujitora didn't cover it up.

* Robin was a villain, yet still helped Luffy multiple times in Alabasta, got saved by a D, then joined the crew by sneaking in.
Bellamy is a villain, tried to kill Luffy multiple times in Dressrosa, Got saved by a D (Law), and will prob join Law's crew. 

But, tbh I think Bellamy will join Barts crew. Image Bellamy bouncing off of Barts barrier walls in mid air. They make a perfect combo. Bart also stated that they are friends now, and even went on to protect him from the creepy confused fishkid.

Once PH was over, the SH crew left a head of Smoker. Prob 1-2hours before Doffy arrived. Since Doffy flew to PH it had to be like 2-3hours away from Dressrosa. Monet was coming in, and out of the island to go see Doffy, Smiles were being transported in/out of the island. So they are all near each other.
