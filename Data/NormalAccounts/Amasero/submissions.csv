Both for the narrative aspect and the aspect of grading value (i most certainly dont want the last 3-4 weeks to be filled with meaningless matches, especially when currently the last weeks are usually the most exciting)

This is from the front page post.

OP is basically saying he doesn't want a ""boring"" 1-2 last week of LCS.

That's his reasoning, that's his statement. Which is dumb, because RIot just has to add a reward. Have a reward for 4-last have something to fight over.

I think the last team does deserve to be relegated, in one split? No..in both splits? Yes. If your last with a record of 4-32, both split combine.

Then you should be dropped, you had two splits to fix your bullshit.

Then we have other kids saying they want ""Mircle runs"". It's not like they will just go, a new squad can also have a Mircle run.

Look at SSG, established brand/team, new squad, Mircle run to worlds final. 

Then we have EU people saying they don't understand why NA sports franchise.

Well we franchise because we have a draft system, building up young talent, and polishing gems.

Look at the Warriors, in Basketball.

Curry was ok 2011-2013. Now he's a fucking monster, thanks to his hard work, and coach.

Klay had a 64 rating in 2011, now he has to have a 84-85 rating. 

Then they drafted another gem called Green.

They used Soccer to compare relegation, but Soccer is so much more different.

You have so many leagues/divisions, loans/ different trade system.

Yet NA is still franchise, and EU isn't. Does it effect you EU kids? Not really, do us NA people like it? Yes we do.

These pages raised a flag for me during my 6th re-read of Cafe raid.

Ishida goes out of his way to explain Arima's mission/orders, and the path of V14/maps it out for us.

Then Yoshi clearly explains the only path would be from coming underground. 

Yes I know,  I know Eto loves gliding/high places, hear me out.

[This panel] (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bFeIzPwTVIY/U-XHCTAlo6I/AAAAAAABgus/mFZM01n0nLg/s0/007.jpg)

That panel is when Eto took interest in Kenny. Why do you ask? Well during the Kanou arc she clearly didn't give a fuck about him.

During Aogiri arc didn't give two fucks about him.

But seeing him survive becoming a ghoul, becoming extremely strong, defeating these ghouls who had their entire life to master their Kagune. In such a short amount of time also. Made Eto from that panel decide that this is the kid that will be the next OEK.

Remember Arima is a ticking time bomb, and they needed to make a one eye strong enough to kill Arima. (We know Ken wasn't strong enough to kill Arima back then)

So, i'm assuming/theory crafting at this point. Eto most likely told Arima that she found a candidate, told him his name/book hobbies, and then left to go watch the Owl vs CCG fight. (Remember Arima gave books to Haise, he already knew about the book loving part.) He also says after Ken recites the poem ""Oh you are..."" which is funny because Arima had a rule not to speak with ghouls. 

And in the series we seen him talk to three (out side of V) ghouls. Yoshimaru, Yoshi was a V member and most likely knew each other. Lantern/Minami young Arima idk if rules apply since Minami was also the first to injure Arima. Then Ken, shouldn't explain this one

I know people believe Hide told Arima about Ken, but that wouldn't make sense to me. The pieces don't fall in line if it was Hide. Eto on the other hand, the pieces fucking fits perfectly.

[Arima states he didn't find either one] (http://mangastream.com/r/tokyo_ghoulre/089/3621/14), but we all know what he was looking for. He was looking for his own death, and someone stronger then him.

[This is when Arima tells Eto he agrees with the OEK candidate] (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--ozMmr4CaKU/VA5Z6nmso1I/AAAAAAAB49c/C-kzK7KPjYE/s0/005.png)

Remember Don Papa, said ""I heard the screams outside my door."" he was on the SS floor. Where Eto reached/invaded.  So i'm a take a guess, and say Eto talked to Don papa. . Since Don knows about the who the King.

But anyways, Roma+Shouta seem extremely friendly with each other, i'm assuming it's because he set her free, and now Roma is helping Furuta by protecting Kanou.

And Furuta went to go fuck some people up.

Furuta went to go stop DonPapa+Uta. Simply because Furuta would have been underground already where Aura+Mugen was. If he went to go kill :RE members.

I'm assuming Don is going to tell Furuta to fuck off, we always knew you weren't a real member.

Would also be a good time to show off Uta's kagune. 

Since Nico lied to Shouta about the OneEyeKing, I bet all the other clowns also lied to Shouta. Since Furuta said, even the clowns are drawing blanks on this one. No, they knew already, since Nico told Ken who the OEK most likely is.

Anyways, I think the clowns are going to team up with Ken. Yomo asked Uta before what the clowns were planning to do with Ken. I believe they will team up. Don seems like a real calculated man. He liked Haise a lot, for obv reasons. He was helping Haise try to unlock his memory. So the real Ken could come out.

Plus Ken already knows 4 real clowns. Itori, Uta, Nico, Don. Itori is his info broker, and Ken always thought of her words during important moments.

Ken is Uta's special customer. Not much more I need to say on how Uta views Kenny.

Ken will need a decent squad to fight with him. Of course having the title OEK will rally up groups to join his side, and having the Arima slayer title will also the same.

Plus best girl Roma got her wish. She got the beautiful white hair Ken back.

20 tick is terrible. It gives me flash backs of CoD golden age on the xbox. Where in my screen, I shot first/hit him. But on his I don't even shoot. Or on my screen I turned that corner, yet still die.

The first hero I played was RoadHog, and first thing I notice was. I can hit bullshit hooks, I didn't know it was because of 20 tick, but jesus. Now playing vs a Roadhog sucks, because I am clearly behind a wall, and I would still get hit. 

At least give us 40tick.

I play league, I know what bullshit hit boxes are(Morgana), and Hanzo is the king of bullshit hit boxes. He shouldn't have the damage he has + being able to shoot 1feet away from the character's model, and it still hits. 

Or Reinhardt smacking me with his hammer from 20feet away.

Idk who's idea it was to give a pc port, console hitboxes. That just seems like laziness to me.

I wasn't going to mention ""Balancing"" but fuck it.

Mei is broken. It takes 3 people to deal with her, unless you are playing McCree. I don't even know why she is able to heal herself, after being frozen...? How does that make sense.

I have a better fix. She shoots IceShards right? Why not make her shift shoot larger ice shards in a 12,3,6,9 o clock position when you click cancel? Instead of her being able to heal back most of her hp. With this I wouldn't care about being slowed to hell, then dying to one ice shard to the face. At least I know her shift can be out played.

Tracer's blink recharge is a joke. I think it should have an anti abuse mechanic at 1 recharge.

Use all 3 blinks &gt; 0 Blinks &gt; Recharge into 1 blink &gt; Use 1 blink &gt; 0 Blinks &gt; Recharge 1 blink &gt; Use 1 blink &gt; 0 blinks

Now my idea is you shouldn't be able to use blink again until you have two charges up. Just like the trailers, have a longer recharge time. 

Yes this throws you of the game flow, for like 3seconds but imo this is the fair way. 

Also her E, would add any amount of blinks back to her current blink. So you know mechanics/skill cap, something this game lacks imo.

I'll start with the easy one.

* 1. Shirahoshi.
(She is still a cry baby, since it's been like only 15-18days.)
An ancient weapon going to the Celestial Dragon's homeland?

I mean....if that doesn't spell trouble then I don't know what is.

I doubt that they know she is an ancient weapon. The only people who know are Neptune, Robin, Caribou, and I believe Vander Deck has an idea that she is.

We know Robin wouldn't spill the beans.

We know Neptune wouldn't spill the beans.

We know Caribou is most likely on Wano.

And Van Deck Is in the neptune palace jail.

So, no way someone will know. Unless! One of the Celestial Dragons or 5 Star Elders remembers that the old Poseidon was also huge.

* 2. King Riku.

King Riku has a bone to pick with the government. There is no way he is going to keep quite that the government let this pirate ruin his life, ruin his country, and also the fact that the Marines helped stop his countries Savior.

He will be one of the prime examples of how terrible the warlord system is. The WarLord system might disband after the reverie.

Or 

We might see King Riku just leave the World Government in general, and adopt the SH Flag. 

* 3. Cobra.

Cobra is going to ask the most dangerous questions during this.
He will most likely upset the CD, or the 5Stars. He will be the catalyst during the Reverie, or it will be Vivi.

* 4. Walpo KNOWS!

Walpo knows Vivi was with the StrawHats! You really think he will keep quite?? Which is why I said Vivi might be the Catalyst.

* 5. StrawHats.

No fucking way the SH's will not be mentioned. 

We have 4 princess who's life has changed because of the StrawHats.
(CryBabyHoshi, Viola aka only girl who liked Sanji, Vivi, and yes i'm including Rebecca.)

6 Kings who's life has changed because of the StrawHats.

(Riku, OnePunchMan, Cobra, Dalton, Walpo, Neptune)

So yea, they are def going to get brought up.



**Anyways, now these just my guess/speculations.**

* 6 Boa Hancock

If Doffy did not fall, he would be going to the Reverie right now. 

Which would mean..a certain Empress could also possibly be attending the Reverie. And that's when the Warlord system will fall, and she will be there to witness it, the only Warlord with Royalty Status.

* 7 STELLY!

This mother fucker....I don't know why he was re-introduced, especially with the chapter with the Revolutionaries going MIA.
I smell a French Revolution coming, especially with that Marie Antoinette looking wife. ",OnePiece,Important notes for the Reverie. (Long Post),https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/4f09fx/important_notes_for_the_reverie_long_post/

Not because how amazing the story, characters, and comedy is.

Just, I been with One Piece since the first episode aired on 4kids.

My first Volume for any manga, was One Piece Volume 2.

I had an off period (Naruto, and Bleach took over IM SORRY)

but I re-picked OP up, during the Thriller bark arc. Yes, with out reading Skypia - Water 7. (Because i'm not a stupid reader, and I can put the pieces together, and yes I have read it. I re-read one piece many times)


Not even going to lie, I was like ""what the fuck is this island/boss they are fighting. Looks like shit.""

THEN BAM. Kuma fucking came, and he hooked me in.

I was there reading weekly the greatest moments that made me re-fall in love with One Piece.

Zoro's sacrifice.

Brooks sad story.

Luffy punching the fuck out of Celestial's.

Seeing Law's broken fruit.

Then Kizaru comes bro. When Kizaru came, idk how the internet reacted, but I was just amazed.

Not amazed at his power, just amazed that Luffy was going to be at that level one day. (Had same feeling when I saw Mihawk vs Zoro)

Then the separation :[

I been following One Piece for a long time, and I never really hit me, it hasn't even hit me. It won't hit me, at least until I see that last Cover Page, and the Final chapter with a giant smile from Luffy.

I'm be so sad when OP ends. I'm a miss reading it weekly. I'm a miss seeing peoples reactions. I miss the hype.

Naruto ended. (I know new series)

Bleach seems like it's going to end this year. (I suggest reading it again. It has gotten better)

Tokyo ghoul will most likely be ending next year. (#1)

I have One Piece for 6-8more years.

All I gotta say man. I'm a enjoy the ride from here on out. We are in an ARC I thought I wouldn't see for another 2years.

( Thought dressrosa would last like 1 1/2 years, but....you know.)

We are at the 80-85% mark of the story.

For next couple of years, we will be reading this weekly. Oda takes a break? Idc, I won't complain anymore. Enjoy the breaks, take the breaks.

Because man....this shit is gold, and I fucking excited to see Luffy fight all the fucking Yonko's.

I want Kaido to get his ass beat.

I want Big Mom to get her twat beat.

I want Shanks to fucking use skills. Like come on man, WHAT CAN YOU DO!? Show us already, i'm ready.

I want Zehahahaahahaha to fucking get HIS ass beat again. 


I'm hyped, and I hope you guys are also.

Because one thing I know about One Piece. That it's [Super] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvlWP4lQ6m8)

TL;DR:

One Piece has been with me for a long time. I am ready to see the last 15% of the content left. I am hyped to see all the yonko's in action.

Tooru is the Ken of this series.

Ken was tortured, but he still came out sane. Little screws loose, but he wasn't like Taki.
Ken also fought out of his chains, and fought Yamori.

Tooru is most likely going to come out of this insane, or dead.

This can be played out multiple ways, but the top 5 ""roads"" I see is.

* Tooru breaks out, and fights Torso/Wins.

* Tooru gets saved by the Q's.

* Tooru is already dead. She is a Torso.

* Tooru follows Torso now as his waifu, and fights the Q's.

* They both kill each other.

It's already been hinted, that Tooru is most likely going to die in the early chapters of Re.

[Hint 1: Chapter 15] (http://imgur.com/N3dKqDR)

Here we see a Torso, of Tooru. What has happen recently with her? She is a Torso atm.

Also, if you notice, the color white is affiliated with Tooru A LOT, like A LOT. Trust me, re-reading TG I was like ""Holy shit, why is Tooru always colored white?"" 

Anyways, in recent chapters, we see Torso call Tooru [""My Tooru""] (http://imgur.com/krvv59l)

Blood on the floor, Torso has his mask on for some reason, a knife, and 0 responds from Tooru.

If you look closely at that panel, you can also clearly tell that she still doesn't have her legs. The wood plank is the bottom of the chair. [Proof] (http://imgur.com/Fc2v8kZ), with that we can safely assume she is still just a Torso.

Even when Urie comes to get her, she will just be a Torso.

If she lives after all this, she is 100% not going to be sane. Her fear for men will skyrocket. Which will cause problems in the long run during missions, that's IF she survives all this shit.

What do you guys think honestly? I can't see her coming out alive. She might be the next Q to die.

I notice a couple, but thanks to this chapter. I realized what Eto's role is going to be in this arc.

Eto is the Ayato.

You probably have a couple questions like ""how the fuck...?""

I'll start with Eto.

If you read Chapter 72 (TG) you see the new awaken Ken. Fighting Ayato, and you know whats happening? Ayato is shoving a monolog down Ken's throat. 

Saying [""You can't kill me, your a pussy, you are weak"" while shooting his feathers at him.] (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vbdqa9RjpBA/UvwUMziJdrI/AAAAAAAABTc/J6LANPpFuGE/s16000/011.png)

Then Ken smacks his ass to the fucking ground, [while looking down on him.] (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PM866GtPG8E/UvwUOXoMcBI/AAAAAAAABTk/b7U38TuHta4/s16000/012.png)

Doesn't this remind you of the current chapter? (Chapter55TGR)

What is the newly awaken Ken doing, after spilling blood? He is dodging eEto's sharp feathers, while Eto is fucking taunting him. Expect, there's a difference.

Ayato was calling him weak. Eto is calling him strong. ( ""Who is stronger? You, or Arima?"" )

Ayato's at the moment goal was a mystery, Eto reveals she just wanted to pass the time/ see the out come.

Ken didn't want to hurt Ayato at first because of Touka.

Ken remembers that he has to save Eto.

Ken decides to half kill Ayato. Ken has decided to fully kill Eto. (And he has the power as well baby!)

All this can be my thinking to far deep, but seeing these pages side by side and then seeing the context of the chapter, just makes what I am saying come together nicely( Won't know untill the arc ends.)

[Pic 1] (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PM866GtPG8E/UvwUOXoMcBI/AAAAAAAABTk/b7U38TuHta4/s16000/012.png)

[Pic 2] (http://readms.com/r/tokyo_ghoulre/55/3087/17) (He's looking down on her)

Next chapter is called deeper wounds...so I am assuming Eto is going to get hurt a lot more. Aka fuck bone lessons. She dies.

Like I said the parallel/twilight/tales of 2 cities theme is crazy in this arc.

(More examples, because they keep popping into my head)

Shu is a twist on Touka's role in this arc.

Touka wants to save Ken. Shu is the one being saved.

Ken saves, and protects Touka. Ken stabs Shuu, and fights Shuu.

Touka fights Ayato for life choices. Shu fights Haise for his life.

(I wish I can add more, but the Arc isn't done yet.)

Another simple one is Noro.

Noro lives in the Aogiri raid. Noro dies in the Rose raid.

Noro is fighting full on ghouls. Noro is fighting half ghouls.

Noro doesn't speak. Noro speaks.

Last one I swear.

Special class told everyone to back off of Owl. Special class is asking everyone to help with the Owl battle.

Clown appears, but did nothing whole arc. Clown appears, and kills a hand full of people.

One Ex-Arima squad member appears, Three Ex-Arima squad members appear.
Ok ok ok, i'm done listing things. I just find it cool, that this arc is not even done, and you can still compare it a lot to Aogiri raid. It's literally a different telling of this arc.

Also, if my comparing is right, then Eto is going to either die this arc. Or she is going to get badly, badly injured.",TokyoGhoul,That Parallel in this arc is insane.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoGhoul/comments/3uyn3z/that_parallel_in_this_arc_is_insane/

But I do know two things!

1. Everyone is annoyed
2. What if time!

What if...Jinbe didn't stop Luffy from fighting BB?

Would Luffy have won?

I say yes, if you look at the fight again. Luffy gets smashed into the ground. Now, BB has some physical strength as we seen multiple times. He made Ace bleed with one punch. He punched WB, and WB felt that shit. He slammed Luffy into the ground, making him bleed. So BB isn't physically weak.

But once Luffy gets up, he's ready to fucking go again. He's like what ever it only hurt for a second. 

If you look at BB when he got jet pistoled by Luffy. That man took so much damage, that he was gasping for air for 2minutes. He even stated ""I didn't...expect you to be this strong.""

If Luffy and BB fought during that time, 100% Blackbeard would have been defeated. Just by Luffy's physical power. 

Yes BB can pull him in, but by the time he is getting pulled in, I am pretty sure Luffy can land a Jet Pistol which would stop the Vortex.

He also couldn't react to Luffy's speed, which will be his down fall in the final fight vs Luffy.

The only reason they didn't fight is simply because BlackBeard wasn't strong enough, and didn't have enough fruits.

Anyways, what do you think? 

If Luffy vs BlackBeard happend, who would have won? 

This also regards if Ace didn't butt in, and got caught.

If BB just went straight for Luffy after Enis Lobby.

Enis Lobby fully recovered Luffy vs BlackBeard.

I been saying this for a long, long time, and everything just points to it.

Let's start off with the fact that Dressrosa is a twisted version of Alabasta.

That being said, Rebecca is the Vivi of this Arc.

Vivi: The loved princess, who turned pirate, who then had a choice between being a princess or a pirate. She choose being a princess.

Rebecca: The hated princess, who turned into a gladiator, who now has a choice between becoming a princess, or joining the pirate life.

Now, what supports my theory is that, this whole Arc Rebecca has been attached/fond of Luffy. The whole damn time, she admires him, and even wanted to fight for him while he rested.

She was willing to die for Luffy twice. Rushing to give him the key, and trying to stop Doffy.
She is the first to really notice that Lucy isn't Luffy.
No,doubt she is attached to him, with the little time they spent together.

Another point is why would Rebecca be princess of the country that hated her?
Before all this went down, everyone was telling Rebecca to eat shit, and die. Do you guys really think she is going to forget about it, and be like ""Ok i'm the lovable princess."" Even if they apologized, there is still that spot in her heart/mind. That wow ""these people hated, and wish me to die for years, now they love me??"" 

In the flashback of Kyros, and Scarlet. Scarlet cannot marry Kyros publicly. The reason was, because people in the country know he is a good guy, but the public know him as a guy who murdered.
That shit doesn't fly.

It's the same thing with Rebecca. She might accept the apologize, but parts of her will still doubt them.

Rebecca owes shit to this country, she wasn't even publicly known as a princess, once people found out, she was hated to hell, and everything was set up so that she won't be a princess after the Arc.

I also, believe that Rebecca wants power, she has been saved everytime. Every damn time. She has seen how strong Luffy is. She has seen how strong Zoro is. She almost killed her fucking aunt, couldn't even fight her mothers killer, and this mother fucking Kyros. ""I can't leave my daughters side."" He didn't even notice her leaving his side, left her at the palace. That alone stands out to me.

Anyways, I believe Rebecca is going to join the crew, do I want it? No. Is it going to happen? Most likely, so brace yourself, for Rebecca being a SH.



TL;DR: Rebecca is becoming a princess to a country that hated/wish her to die for years. No way she is going to be a princess for that country. She also admires the fuck out of Luffy. She is going to join the crew most likely in the next chapter-three chapters.

We also see that Bound man can repel any physical attacks from Doflamingo.

Don't get me wrong, I think Kid will lose, but Shanks isn't coming out of this uninjured mentally/physically. 

Let's talk about what each captain in the alliance brings to the table.

Hawkins is a fucking mystery, the only thing we really know is that he turns into a scarecrow, who can have Voodoo dolls who take the damage instead of himself. He is a close range swordsman, who can predict/see his death.

So I doubt he is going into this with a 80% death/fail rate.

Scratch-man Apo: Long range bomber. We seen this man blow/cut Kizaru in half. So he's going to be the long range type in the fight.

Kid: Kid can control metal. So it makes sense to go after the only crew that mostly everyone uses a weapon. He would just be able to pull them in, or make all the bullets shoot out from the guns.

Now everyone is going to say ""Oh but Shanks probably has a good grip on his sword!"" Yea he probably does, but he might get caught off guard with the weapons pulling/ when he attacks Kid might just push his sword away, which slows Shanks down, and lets someone dodge.

Also safe to assume everyone of these people has new moves, just like how law only did room+shambles pre time skip. Current arc he has down plenty of new moves.

Now the strategy they might do is make dolls out of the lower tier members of Shanks crew. Now, if Hawkins take's any damage they will be redirected to the dolls right? Bam Shanks just killed his own crew.

Apo most likely can use music note bombs. 
Like in Dragon Ball Z, when Piccolo does Hellzone Garnade.
He makes a bunch of Music notes surrounding Shanks to cripple his movements. If he moves, the music notes blow up/ follow him.

Kid would just make all the bullets shoot from everyones pistols. 

He would also pull in all the weapons (if he can.) 

Also, pretty sure his metal arm does something besides function as an arm.

But ultimately Shanks is going to win, but he's going to congrats  
them, then he will enter try hard pissed off mode (Don't hurt my nakama's etc etc). Pressure all of them down with his haki. So, now Hawkins has a choice, either wait until Shanks kills all the dolls in him, to kill Hawkins, or surrender. Ben, Lucky, and Yasopp will all be pointing there guns at Apo in close range.

Umm....Jinbe is the leader of the sun pirates....he pretty much accepted Luffy's invitation. So yea captains could join the crew, and can bring their crew mates.

Another proof is X-Drake.

He serves under Kaido, he still has his same ship, and crew mates. 

So, we can assume that they are captains of their own division, or work under one.

Anyways, anything you say is invalid with those two being captains, and can't join the Strawhats because of that.

* Then this man met his brother (who he thought was dead) 

* Freed over 10k toy's, who were forgotten.

* Took out the corrupt King/Warlord/Underground broker Doflamingo.

* Helped Fujitora show how shitty the warlord system is.

* Got King Riku back in power. 

* By getting Riku back in power, other countries war will stop in due time. (Since he helped stop all the wars in the surrounding countries)

* World will prob know that Sabo+Luffy are brothers.
