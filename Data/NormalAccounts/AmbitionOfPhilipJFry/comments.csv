5,"We can't decide for you.

I will say if you think nursing school is tough, you're going to freak out working the first year as an RN. This [image comes to mind](http://imgur.com/iRogYkr). No-one can tell you how difficult it will be except by experiencing it. I just finished up my first year and its still challenging. 

Yesterday I had a developmentally delayed teenager post aortic root post op day 1 come down from the unit and noticed global ST elevations and a low grade fever that no-one else had seen. Yay, run in circles to check all avenues. And take out his foley, take out his IJ &amp; put in a new peripheral IV while you're at it.

I had a 100% no english speaking guy with an emergent mechanical valve put in as my second patient. I put over 2 hours with him on the translator phone over my 12 hour shift. He has no insurance is illiterate and cannot write and will need warfarin monitoring. No, fruit doesn't have protein in it and that won't help heal your sternotomy, sir. He also got bedside tapped by pulm IR for a pleural effusion with over 1.2L of bloody serous coming out of his chest. Never complained of pain or shortness of breath. 

The last guy I had was on a balloon pump after an aortic root replacement an aneurysm repair so severely decompensated. He's 10 kgs up which means 22lbs of surgical water needs flushed out with lasix. Oh, and his hematocrit is below 24, mind giving him a unit or two of blood while you're dealing with his constant urine and post-op diarrhea? Awesome, k, thnx bye. His NP for the day was the type that dumps into the list 10 orders at once while first getting in, going to lunch and leaving at the end of the day and doesn't notify you about any of them. 

As an aside, I never knew this before working as a nurse but you can hear someone rolling their eyes on the other side of the phone phone in exasperation while notifying them his respiration rate is in the 30s.

34,"Having just read a 50 page policy paper on lessons learned from Ukraine, this is no surprise.

Russia has fielded 17 different types of drones from quad copters to high altitude recon. They have an unspoiled, unparalleled live view that allows rounds on target in under fifteen minutes. Western armies train still like they're the only ones with UAVs.

Russia has a UAV denial system of a directional GPS jammer that causes military grade drones (donated by Germany to the Ukraine) to go into autorecovery and land safely.

Russia is focusing this UAV targeting for MLS thermobaric and top down munitions to kill light infantry vehicles and mechanized infantry, the two things western Europe has as a primary maneuvering force. An observer witnessed two mechanized battalions destroyed in three minutes. 85% of casualties on each side have been from artillery.

Russia has integrated long and medium artillery into smaller unit sizes. Direct and indirect systems allows for assault fire or denial of operations in a large bubble around the maneuvering force.

Russia's tanks are untouchable. They have reactive armor and auto shotgun systems to destroy the guidance packages of anti tank missiles. This prevents RPGs and direct anti tank missiles, the only system capable of defeating the armor are Javelin top down systems.

Russia is playing up the mass media astro turf war of minority group politics. They were able to split the Ukraine because of deep held divisions between ethic groups.

&gt;Just as Jesus can free your soul, this book is equally as important as it can free your body from corporate ownership. if you have a birth certificate and SS# then you are literally owned by THE UNITED STATES Corporation. Any registrar is by law a contract called ""title to the body"". If you registrar something to a company you are legally handing over ownership of that item to that company. Christians will find it interesting to note that under ""Section 666 of Title 42 (the social security act) (42 USC sec 666) now requires every state, as a condition of Federal Revenue, to obtain the ""number of your name"" before you can receive any state services. If you have a SS# the beast has the ""title to your body"" and literally and legally owns you.

&gt;Don't you want to be FREE?

&gt;This book takes you step by step and teaches you how to fill out a ""Claim for the life"" legal document that takes back ownership of your ""vessel"" Body through a real working legal process with papers that have to be notarized at the court house. This is not a joke.

&gt;Under THE UNITED STATES Codes a ""American Citizen"" is defined as a Vessel owned by the corporation THE UNITED STATES and is an immigrant of the corporation with no claim to human rights or the constitution. A ""Sovereign American National"" however does have claim to human rights and the constitution.

&gt;What is a Sovereign?

&gt;Usually they are Christians but a Sovereign is anyone who is born in any of the 50 states of the union. anyone born in America can stop being an immigrant of the corporation and start being a Sovereign with claim to human rights and the constitution. The courts of American have silently done away with common law courts and instituted Maritime/Admiralty courts that judge you under the ""law of the sea"" however most American think they are being judged under common law ""law of the land"" because we are not on a ship at sea.

&gt;THE UNITED STATES codes states that THE UNITED STATES is a foreign corporation. So why are most Americans letting a foreign corporation judge them under ""law of the sea"" also known as martial law rules? They don't know. Most Americans know nothing about common law as civics has been taken out of public education.

&gt;They don't realize that THE UNITED STATES has no rule over them because a person of one jurisdiction ""law of the land/common law"" can NOT be judged under another jurisdiction ""law of the sea/maritime law"". Anytime you see a court with a flag that has a yellow fringe that is stating their jurisdiction which is maritime/law of the sea jurisdiction.

&gt;Sovereigns are under common law/law of the land which and by ucc code/ international law that all courts all over the planet must adhere to, they can NOT judge any case against you. Also note a corporation can not bring suit against a real person ""sovereign"" but they can bring suit against your legal entity, the name in all caps on your ""birth certificate"".",2016-10-11 13:22:20+00:00,d8n9k53,2.0,t1_d8mw2ld,33975.0,ProtectAndServe

Abstract from Miller, SI et al. *[Hypoglycemia as a manifestation of sepsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6990758)*. Am. J Med.: 

Hypoglycemia has rarely been described as a clinical sign of severe bacterial sepsis. We recently encountered nine patients in whom hypoglycemia (mean serum glucose of 22 mg/dl) was associated with overwhelming sepsis. Clinical disease in these patients included pneumonia and cellulitis; in three patients, no focus of infection was apparent. Altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, leukopenia, abnormal clotting studies and bacteremia were common features in these cases. In four patients, no cause for hypoglycemia other than sepsis was present. In five patients, another possible metabolic cause for hypoglycemia was present (alcoholism in four and chronic renal insufficiency in one) although none had been observed to be hypoglycemic on previous hospitalizations. Streptococcus pneumoniae (three cases) and Hemophilus influenzae, type b, (two cases) were the most common pathogens, and the over-all mortality was 67 per cent. The mechanism(s) for hypoglycemia with sepsis is not well defined. *Depleted glycogen stores, impaired gluconeogenesis and increased peripheral glucose utilization may all be contributing factors. Incubation of bacteria in fresh blood at room temperature does not increase the normal rate of breakdown of glucose suggesting that the hypoglycemia occurs in vivo. Hypoglycemia is an important sign of overwhelming sepsis that may be more common than has previously been recognized.*",2016-09-20 15:58:15+00:00,d7upz06,3.0,t1_d7u2kez,48250.0,nursing

As for the pulse ox, don't worry about it. Its a bit of a silly thing we worry about. It measures, as you found out,  how red the blood is out at where the probe is, not how well she's exchanging, metabolizing and perfusing oxygen. She was actually overoxygenated as your Pa02 proved.

Sounds like she's got horrible peripheral vascular disease and Raynauds. If you're allowed to do it, do q4hr spot checks and warm her hands up with hot packs beforehand. If you do constant monitoring it'll drive you crazy or could lead to oxygen toxicity ontop of everything else.

178,"Yeah.

I had a massive amount I'd debt from a first college degree, political science. Private loans ate up more than I could afford for rent n food with the minimum wage jobs I could find, this was right after the 2007/08 crash.

I moved in with out of state relatives. My dad died of a stroke when I was 17, n my narcissistic mom hates me and refused to let me move in. 

My brother was getting into trouble and I had him moved up with us until he graduated high school. Fast forward two years. He graduated. 

My uncle had a heart attack and survived around that time. My aunt told me she wanted me out in a few months and didn't care if I'd be homeless or not. 

My 2 year temp job came to an end and I was underemployed again. My EMT night class were still going on. She bought me a lifeguarding class cert and I worked my butt off and got a job as an ocean surf guard for summer. 

I only ate homemade bread rolls, eggs and pasta but survived. In fall, I took out private loans to gamble on nursing prerequisite course. 

My roommate friends all moved end of summer, and I was homeless for a month couch surfing. I found a room through a friend at his friends place but it was dirty, shitty and cash only. Each month I had to split my meager EMT paycheck between food, rent or student loans. Often it was choose two only. I lost 40lbs in 4 months unintentionally. 

After the fall semester, I got into nursing school and loan repayment was put on hold. I moved in with my new girlfriend and split finances. Life still was rough but at least I wasn't starving.

I graduated last spring. I found a real RN job in fall that pays rent, double student loans, and for food. It took four and a half years and a lot of blind faith to continue focusing on studying while starving.

Yet I still save all my money because it still feels like things could explode at any second. Old habits die hard.",2016-08-28 16:01:04+00:00,d701w20,2.0,t1_d6zyxu1,5125.0,REDDITORSINRECOVERY

201,"There's kind an inverted logic to BanAllModerators however. The narrative and opinion sounds nice on its own construction. Yet you need to stand back and look at the larger picture. You're entitled to opinions but not facts.

Fact- republicans are for drug laws, three strike and zero tolerance policies. Once you get a record, its very hard to get employment, sometimes impossible if you're a young black man already struggling. You need a job to gain reliable independence from the crab bucket of the ghetto.

Fact- republicans are pro prisons. Prisons tear apart family structures. According to the 2011 census, 64% of black homes in America are fatherless. Fatherless homes are two to three times more likely to be poor, to use drugs, to experience educational, health, emotional and behavioral problems, to be victims of child abuse, and to engage in criminal behavior than their peers who live with their married, biological (or adoptive) parents.

Fact- republicans are against abortion. Whatever you may feel about abortion, facts again show that family planning helps people succeed financially. If you've got a house of unplanned dependents, you're not going to be able to secure employment, which won't allow you to get out of the situation. Additionally, the poverty cycle becomes more harsh once you've got dependents.

Passing out from a high heart rate is from not enough blood getting to your brain. Your brain wants you to lie down so your heart doesn't beat hard and force blood up against gravity so it makes you lie down by passing out.

Your limbs don't get the nutrients they need to sustain and rebuild themselves on a daily basis so they start to erode away in ulcers. Additionally, any minor trauma is a big deal. I met a person who needed a toe amputated after cutting skin with a nail clipper accidentally.

It is not curable but you try to optimize healing by putting in stents or rotor-rootering to open major limb arteries, bypassing the blockage, by putting them on blood thinners to have more blood get past the blockages or by sharp debridement of nonviable tissue.

Unfortunately often that person will need to have an amputation of the affected area.

PVD is caused by, like heart disease, a combination of atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking.

Things to look out for: cold, like ice cold feet/hands, lack of pulses, pain relieved by walking (squeezing the blood in/out by using large muscles associated with walking) history of pain relived by swinging the feet over or off of a bed (just my experience of people about to get their foot amputated the only relief is dangling the foot).

54% of homicides in the US over a 20 year period were caused by blacks, which make up 13% of the US population.

313,"In a week of rising tensions following police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota, cops in Tennessee, Missouri and Georgia were targeted in a string of separate attacks against police, law-enforcement authorities said.

In Bristol, Tenn., a small city in the state’s northeast corner, a man who killed one woman and wounded three other people including a police officer early Thursday may have been motivated by recent incidents involving police and black people, Tennessee law enforcement authorities said Friday.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation named Lakeem Keon Scott, a 37-year-old black man, as the suspect behind the shootings. Mr. Scott opened fire along a Tennessee roadway, killing one woman, a driver identified as Jennifer Rooney, and wounding three others including the officer. All four victims were white, although authorities didn’t claim Mr. Scott specifically targeted white people.

Law-enforcement officials said Mr. Scott “may have targeted individuals and officers after being troubled by recent incidents involving African-Americans and law-enforcement officers in other parts of the country,” a reference to police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota earlier this week.

Police said he was armed with at least two weapons, including an automatic-style rifle and pistol, and a large amount of ammunition. Authorities believe he fired shots from a parking lot along the roadway, a spokesman for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. Local police wounded Mr. Scott during a shootout, sending him to the hospital.

A Days Inn clerk who was shot through a window was in serious but stable condition at the same hospital Friday. Injuries to the two other Bristol-area shooting victims, including the officer, were less serious.

In Dallas late Thursday, 25-year-old sniper Micah Xavier Johnson ambushed police officers, killing five cops and injuring seven others in what may be the deadliest incident for U.S. cops since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Johnson, who was black, said he wanted to “kill white people, especially white officers,” according to the Dallas chief of police. After negotiating with Johnson for several hours, Dallas officers killed him using a bomb-disposal robot jury-rigged with explosives.

In Valdosta, Ga., authorities said a man called 911 early Friday to report a car break-in, then ambushed and shot the police officer who responded. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation identified the shooter as 22-year-old Stephen Paul Beck. The agency said he shot Police Officer Randall Hancock at least twice in his protective vest and once beneath the vest in the abdomen. The officer returned fire, striking the suspect.

The motive behind this shooting is unknown, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a news release Friday. The police officer was in stable condition following the shooting, while the suspect was in serious condition. The police said there was no apparent connection to the ambush against Dallas police.

A police officer in suburban St. Louis was shot in an ambush-style attack as he walked back to his patrol car during a routine traffic stop Friday morning, but police declined to link the case to the recent shooting in Dallas of five officers or the officer-involved deaths of two black men earlier in the week.

The officer had pulled over the car for speeding in the city of Ballwin, Mo., authorities said. The officer spoke with the driver and was returning to his car when the man suddenly jumped out of the car, rapidly approached the officer and fired three shots. The officer was struck at least once. Neighbors called 911, and the officer was in critical condition at a local hospital, said Kevin Scott, chief of the Ballwin department.

The driver of the car sped away but was eventually spotted by another officer several miles away and apprehended after a foot chase, Chief Scott said.

“We believe that that Ballwin officer was ambushed,” said Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police Department, whose officers helped respond to the incident and are leading the investigation.

While referencing the events in Dallas, both officers declined to provide a motive for the shooting.

“I’m not going to try to get into his head,” Chief Belmar said. “I’m not going to give him a motive, but it’s safe to say it’s a very difficult time in law enforcement.”

New York Police Department Chief of Intelligence Thomas Galati said the department was investigating 17 threats against police that came in following the death of Alton Sterling, a black man killed by police in Baton Rouge, La., on Tuesday. None have been deemed credible, NYPD Commissioner William Bratton said at a news conference.

Mr. Bratton said the Dallas shootings were “eerily similar” to the murders of New York City Police Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos in 2014. “Two of our police officers murdered during the height of demonstrations around issues of racial injustice,” he said. “This is a continuing crisis in this country that needs to be addressed.”

In Baton Rouge, the family of Mr. Sterling joined Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards at a news conference Friday where the governor called for peace despite grief and anger. “We are better than this,” Mr. Edwards said. “We are going to do better in the future.”

A lawyer for the Sterling family members said their hearts are broken by the deaths in Dallas. “It was a tragedy,” Justin Bamberg said in an interview. “They relate because they are dealing with their own tragedy.”

Mr. Bamberg, a South Carolina state legislator who also represented the family of Walter Scott, a black man killed last year by a white police officer in North Charleston, S.C., said it is wrong to respond to violence with violence.

“If you can mourn the loss of Alton Sterling, or Walter Scott, or Trayvon Martin, or Eric Garner, or Tamir Rice, and celebrate at the same time what happened to the officers in Dallas?” Mr. Bamberg said. “You have morphed into the very thing that you despise, which is the unjust and unlawful killing of innocent people.”

Second duty call comes in, the ALS car would go and page out for the second line truck to meet them.

361,"Right, so the NHTSA did a series of weighted sled crashes and type II and III crashes with test dummies. You can find the 15-page paper [here as a PDF](http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/esv/esv21/09-0471.pdf).

Of problem, there are no test crash standards or protocols for ambulances. Most ambulances are custom designed by someone like PL customs after a skeleton chassis is made by ford or freightliner or international. Those skeleton chassis are built to private and commercial safety standards for the van/truck chassis but not to working EMS realities.

There are no ambulance safety crash standards at this time due to 1. the weirdness of a new niche industry evolving from driving mortician cars really fast. 2. the end users desiring ""clinical erganomics"" or how to move around in the back of a truck to get what you want, takes priority over actual crash safety.

The side seats with shoulder strap webbing continuously snapped the test dummies' cervical vertebrae in accidents from either the impact of the webbing snapping around a heavy head on a thin spinal column or having their smash into unpadded overhead side compartments. 

The waist belted seats were useless and the dummies were ejected into the crew compartment. Even a 36 miles an hour side crash produced life-threatening injuries to the dummies on a bench seat despite crew compartment not being intruded and the acceleration speed should be survivable with most other modern vehicles. 

Vanbulances magnify these effects compared to heavier traditional box trucks.

Flying unsecured equipment is a killer.

We should be wearing helmets in the back of trucks and ratcheting restraint systems when working on patients.

378,"&gt;I would think doing the EMT thing would be frustrating with all the things you're not allowed to do but are trained in. Any truth to that?

Short answer, yes.

When I was a basic working nights/weekends while in nursing school, it was frustrating. I initially had a horrendous ALS partner, but it wasn’t his fault. No, seriously, it was the department of health’s fault. The rhode island DOH has created an intermediate level known as a cardiac, which means that rhode island is the only state in the union which doesn’t have a paramedic provider at an ALS level. The old Ems conference jokes about “rhode island reds’ (rhode island red is the state bird, a rooster) are very true (They were taught years ago what color medication box to deal with various dysrhythmias- call up med control and ask, “hey doc, are the squiggles a red vial or a blue vial?”). They have a 6 week course and are set free to provide healthcare.

In any case, he was a firefighter and he worked well with an ALS provider above him but leave him own in the back of a truck and he was quickly overwhelmed and would often convince himself that the septic hypotensive person would “be fine you can take him” or the altered mental status person with a drooping face “well, what can I do to help them? I’ll just drive fast”. It got to the point where I had to contact my supervisor and she told me to document the hell out of everything. Eventually the company busted him down and he was licensed as ALS with the state but only could work as a basic on trucks.

My second aLS partner was an old army medic. Once we understood one another’s skills and knowledge, we got along great. He was all over ALS and wouldn’t leave me with anyone that was a true ALS transport. That being said, I did have a spider tingle once or twice that I won on. BLS transport, guy’s pulse gets weaky n thread and he says he feels really dizzy. I put him on the EKG and he’s new onset of A-fib with RVR. I banged on the glass, told him to pull over cuz we needed to switch out immediately. Did so and we hopped on along the way less than 2 minutes later.

In essence, I was constrained either way. But the second person lessened the frustration by his skill level and experience immediately taking over the situation.

&gt;I'm looking for advice from someone who is/was a paramedic who went through nursing school to shed some light on how paramedic school compared to nursing school, and any advice they could offer to prep for nursing school.

Nursing school fucking sucks. There’s no other way around it. The flowcharts for the NCLEX are like the flowcharts for the NREMT test but they’re assbackwards and convoluted. Honestly, I think you could probably take a nursing Kaplan course, learn the flowcharts, and bullshit you rway through the NCLEX with the knowledge you have now. But they’ll stuff four years of nursing research, care plans (shudder), nursing “theory,” and maslov’s hierarchy of needs into your maw prior to letting you get to that simple flowchart.

Simply put, the nursing profession is a bundle of confusion wrapped in a skin of insecurity. Nurses are by and far away considered the eyes and ears of doctors so they need to be taught very methodical assessment skills. Nursing care plans are formalized knowledge that are flowsheets for simple logic that allow nurses to tap dance around and diagnose medical problems without actually saying the medical terminology. “Shortness of breath as evidenced by blue face, rapid breath, low pulse ox, and need for ned treatments” instead of simply saying “dyspnea secondary to asthma”. In the end, you still give them a fuckin neb, 02, and monitor their airway for swelling but you arrive at one way aboard a rickety old wild west traincar coated in mud, arrows and cactuses that’s traveled through god knows where and the other one is a new Japanese bullet train that’s got free espresso machines.

EMS experience is a liability in 95% of nursing. I’ve had HR and administrative nurses tell me flat out that, direct quotes here, “I don’t care how many IV’s I’ve put in, I have a team of people to do that for me” and “I don’t care if you can intubate people without orders, you’ll never be able to assess like a nurse”. That was when I was asking around if my EMS experience was a liability or an asset as a new RN graduate. Most RNs think we're a bunch of fuckup cowboy retards who can't sit still long enough to color inbetween the lines of our continuing education worksheets (or not stab one another severely with the crayons). And they're probably right for most prehospital care providers.

But I also got my job since one of the unit educators was a former EMT and recognizes the importance of EMS.

Critical care and emergency department RNs (at least, the good ones) know the value of a competent prehospital provider.

You will need to take some form of anatomy. Do well in anatomy, it’s the foundation for everything else. It’s the biggest weeder class that most nursing programs have, except for MedSurg (medical-surgical) nursing. That shit will sink many a ditzy sorority girl. 

Get the anatomy coloring books on Amazon, I actually have two of them sitting on my bookshelf with a new pack of pencils as we speak. A PA teaching my cohort recommended getting them for bathroom reading (I’d had photocopies in RN school but never money to buy them) so I got them. Its amazing how much we forget what we know as soon as you aren’t being constantly quizzed over it.

Learn generic medications, namely what classes do what with pharmacokinetics.

Roll with the punches.

Don't be afraid to be a giant in a little league game. I'm guessing you're going back to school in your late 20s, early 30s. [Read this thread](https://www.reddit.com/comments/b2uq6/im_30_years_old_and_decided_to_go_back_to_school/) and take it to heart. In particuarly, this guy's quote:

&gt; I am 100% focused on ""winning"" school.

&gt;I treat this shit like I am competing in the olympics. I want to know what my classmates are getting on their papers, and I want to make sure it's no where near as good as what I receive. If someone else get's an A, I want to pick up extra credit. Learning as much as I possibly can and destroying the competition are the only things that matter to me these next two years. I want to win every possible award come graduation. I want every professor to know my name. I want to be my University's golden child.

&gt;*It's like I'm an adult man who has somehow managed to trick everyone into allowing him back into little league baseball.* I am just absolutely crushing the competition.

&gt;Do it. Just do it. There is nothing more gratifying than being top dog.

Oh, and nursing as a job is a separate beast from nursing school. Its like the nursing slide keeps going steeper the longer you get into nursing school with more fire hoses being turned on at you. And then when you graduate, you get thrown into the deep end of a pool with hungry, aggressive sharks and giant squids. And the poolwater is actually blood. With AIDs and needles.

Nurses eat their young. Nurses are horrible, horrible coworkers, educators, and managers. A few are cool but most I just want to strangle. And as much as we get offended at being called ambulance drivers, and we admit its true in our honest moments, nurses also are pill passing butt wipers. RN really stands for refreshments &amp; narcotics, it’s a service industry job that’s more akin to waiting tables than healthcare on some floors. But your wife’s mileage may vary. Some floors are truly awesome and do really remarkable things but most of the time its like EMS- boring, annoying, and mindcrushingly stupid shit. “Yes, ma’am, I can recite ACLS protocols, interpret an EKG with corresponding anatomical coronary arteries of the heart but I’d really be happier to apologize for not getting enough ice for your third cranberry and apple juice mix of the day. Would you like more blankets? This room is cold now that you’re high as a kite on dilaudid, isn’t it?”

I hold on because I want to bridge EMS and nursing. 

I went to nursing school to be at the top of EMS in my mind- a flight nurse. I can put up with gushing rivulets of C-diff shit (5 shits in the last forty minutes of my shift from one poor lady alone), I can put up with a halfdozen members of a family pissed at you because a different floor put a pressure ulcer sore in their loved one’s ass by not turning him for five days with his intubation secondary to acidosis, I can put up with angry doctors over things I have no control over, and I can put up with the insane amount of checkbox click charting if it means I can be the one flying around in helicopters in 3-5 years’ time.

IFT will show you how to get good at paperwork, assessing, and taking vitals on the road. Protip- assess the patient first then read the paperwork and see if your findings match the hospital's sheet. IFT'll make you familiar with being in the back of a truck as well as driving trucks in traffic.

See if you can staff details for concerts or large events- these are different types of EMS, especially if poop goes down like a riot.

911 will show you emergent situations and how to handle them. A year should be enough time to show you a mixture of medical and trauma. Find a good medic to mentor you, you'll learn what to look for and what not to do.

418,"Logged in to comment.

I did a narcan outreach project my senior nursing school year in an emergency department.

Most people who OD don't want to OD. They get a bad batch, or a batch tainted with something other than regular heroin. In Rhode Island a year ago it was the beginning of fentanyl laced heroin. Someone found a large shipment of fentanyl gel patches, they cooked the gel into a powder and then mixed it in the heroin. For those chasing the dragon, it was marketed as a more potent high. Well, yeah, transdermal meds injected IV will get you super high- or in most cases, dead.

The non script Narcan isn't targeted for the users. Its for the family and friends of users. The friends and family of users are the survivors after they OD and die. We have to think about them, not just the user. 

Narcan is a lifeline for when they do OD. Its a chance that allows family members to act (to reduce PTSD which has a large component of being helpless in an overwhelming situation) and it allows them buy breathing time until EMS arrives. Its not a license to be brave and OD as much as you want- how many people who OD can actually administer Narcan, u/smegma_in_my_teeth?

In any case, pharmacists MUST train the user who purchase it and are emphatic it buys time until EMS and definitive care and it will quickly wear off and not work.

On a final note, think about the brain dead ODs from oxygen starvation. If a 28 year old brain dead kid has no DNR and becomes vent dependent, how many hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent on ventilation, on critical care medicine, on long term skilled nursing care? How much suffering from their families?

If only one or two of these cases can be prevented these scripts have done their job. ",2016-05-20 16:26:04+00:00,d3d2xrv,3.0,t1_d3cwj2p,9116.0,ems

475,"Hi.

BSN, RN, EMT here. 

What /u/AmlanceJockey is saying is partially true from a legal stand point and a practical standpoint.

From a practical standpoint, saying ""emts can drops kings, combis, start neb txs, give limited meds,"" is true. When you arrive on scene and you're the only healthcare professional and provider, you work off the state department of health's prehospital care protocols. Its a series of medical if-then flowchart orders created by the emergency medical director (EG, if compromised airway as evidenced by X, Y, Z, then put in king airway). Its like our in-hospital order sets except instead of being for just one person they're for Johnny Q. Public.

From a legal standpoint, he is working under that EM MD's license when he's following his memorized set orders and protocols. Any deviation is considered malpractice. It is blatantly false that ""in our final form we can initiate treatments without orders"". They are there, most just don't stop to think about them. EMTs do have licenses, not certifications, that are governed by the individual state boards of health.

In the hospital setting, there are many other healthcare professionals and CNAs/EMTs compete on the lowest rung as providers. In the prehospital setting, there are few healthcare providers and paramedics are at the top of the food chain. (It goes firefighter, first responder, EMT-B, EMT-A, Paramedic). But paramedics are spread out sometimes so its up to the EMTs to deliver the best care with what they have.

One final note, with helicopter EMS there are CCRN/CEN RNs, paramedics, and RTs aboard. Some places, I know Boston MedFlight and Hartford Hospital, truly can do whatever they want and then do a case review with the medical director after every single encounter at the end of the month. It builds trust, enhances education opportunities, and hones decision making. And Army medics can do whatever the hell they want without any oversight (which is why they are often cowboy civilian medics).

Any questions, let me know.",2016-04-09 15:53:50+00:00,d1w8eax,5.0,t1_d1w4m7c,7515.0,ems
476,"it was such a manufactured moment, I remember watching it live and the news afterwards. It was first pitched as citizens of Iraq trying to topple it with a sledgehammer, the camera angle was long and zoomed. There were supposedly crowds but when it zoomed out you could see maybe 12 people. Then it they changed to a us truck pulling it down when the sledging failed.

Why have we been fighting sense? Complex. But a few simple facts will sketch the big picture.

Sunnis and Shiites are two tribes in Iraq. They disagree on Muhammad's descendants. The minority was in power and majority was treated horribly.

The Iraq army dissolved, it wasn't captured out killed. We round up all the key people we could and put them in a massive jail. The insurgency grew organized from the people we couldn't catch, fed off the unguarded weapons depots and literally plane load pallets of cash we flew in to bribe people to stop fighting. 

There was a big scandal with Abu Ghraib with us torturing the captured ones into giving up information about the free ones. That fueled recruitment.

Iraq became a scrimmage ground for the militants, a laboratory of planning and perfecting suicide bombing tactics and manufacturing, poison gas attacks, and hit and runs. Authority dissolved into strong men protecting their neighborhood with a local religious themed militia. Anyone who could afford it left the country (often the better educated whom had the best chance of being future civic leadership).

When the prisons dissolved, the professional killers in there had networked and planned to create ISIS, which took advantage of Syria's vacuum of power from years of civil war. They moved north and the rest is history.",2016-04-09 14:06:53+00:00,d1w53hy,2.0,t1_d1w2vwq,5629.0,ThisDayInHistory

The GOP isn't looking for a leader. They're not looking for anything but a mouthpiece to make nice with the press, to shake some hands, and repeat their damn lines.

The last time they tried that out, they got George HW Bush, and he started to do sh*t on his own, without mandate, without sanction, he reversed a good number of the feel good, but ultimately short term ""solutions"" that caused more problems than they actually addressed, and he then had to fall on his sword. They've tried actual qualified ""leaders"" and they tend to upset a lot of apple carts with their ""experience"" and ""thinking"" and that is NOT what this current iteration of the GOP is looking for in the least. They want fully paid off, fully loyal, fully vetted without a hint of ethical or moral consistency, and the most important part of that equation is ""bought and paid for.""

He represents something that they actually DO fear: a genuine grassroots movement. Not the Astroturf that the TEA Party represents: because if you're grassroots, you don't have a network promoting your organizational events. Trump is the one thing that the GOP leadership actually fears above all other things: an actual challenge.

525,"You did nothing wrong. Healthcare is a suprisingly unique and complex field with dozens of machines that border on the complexities of nuclear submarines. For example, [this room](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_oJCvHGt1QqU/TNzm4WSnU2I/AAAAAAAAB-A/LGwBGc0mIgE/s1600/IMG_20100805_095505.jpg) I pulled from a public google image search for ECMO. No-one in their right mind would expect anyone to know what they're doing in that room without years of training and experience.

I've also learned that healthcare has its own little subfields and specalities. Prehospital care is its own specialty and people can take years to become proficient and safe enough to work in the most challenging setting of [the prehospital environment](http://lifeflight.duhs.duke.edu/sites/lifeflight.duhs.duke.edu/files/styles/flexslider_default/public/flexslider/home-banner-3.jpg?itok=crd0LhIQ).

You're at the bottom of the rung right now. Its not a bad thing, everyone has to start there. But you realize it clearly and painfully after that call experience. Focus on what you learned from each lesson:

1. calls come in at any time, always be prepared *before* arriving on a shift to be out all day long

2. be prepared for that first call to be a serious enough one that it could be a code, respiratory distress, MVA with entrapment, infant seizure, etc...

3. know where things are in the truck. Do a rig check at least once a shift for the first year, maybe ever 8 hours for the first few months on shift. When its 3am, your head is spinning, you've got adrenaline pumping enough you feel like you could rip the side door off its hinges you need to know where the different sized CPAP mask is. Or the GSW kit or whatever you're looking for.

4. Situational awareness in the truck is key. Know how to load the patient in, how to move around in the truck, know *where and what your patient is doing at all times* and have plans for plans in the back of your head

5. Learn how the equipment works. Ask your medic to help set up a CPAP circuit and explain what the different components' purposes are for on the patient. Ask how to transfer from your service's equipment to the hospital's equipment. ALWAYS ASK before you do. The people who matter will help you and those who won't further your education and career will be grumpy. Its good to find out quickly whom you can trust.

6. Practice setting up the equipment. Its not a natural thing, these are all man-made components that are working off of physics or biochemistry principals in order to deliver physiological interventions to the patient. Ask if there is expired stuff for you to practice on. Learn how to set up bristajets, what supplies are needed for an IV start, spike with IV tubing, pressure bags, how to draw up meds using what size syringes &amp; gauge needles, how to set up a 4-lead/5-lead monitor and a 12-lead EKG.

True, 99% of calls aren't going to need a trauma surgeon to suture off a bleeding artery. But its the little things that add up. One can categorize that 99% of fractures are treated in field by stabilizing with a splint and the ED won't do more than that. 

But one can also state that 100% of those 99% are treated in the hospital by:

1. Assessing with imaging to find the exact extent of the damage and interpreting the images 

2. planning how to fix the damage (Eg, pins v. hard cast v. invasive rods &amp; debridement of shattered bone tissue).

3. providing additional periphery surgical services, like infectious disease or pain management (Eg, a dirty open fracture means a chance of ostemyelitis and so you're going to possibly need at least prophylactic iv antibiotics at least as a loading dose than PO for the rest of that scheduled treatment or even in-patient IV antibiotics)

582,"Krisha Gotami, a young woman had the good fortune to
live at the time of the Buddha. 

When her firstborn child was about a year old, it fell ill and died. Grief-stricken and clutching its little body Krisha Gotami roamed the streets, begging anyone she met for a medicine that could restore her child to life. 

Some ignored her, some laughed at her, some thought she
was mad, but finally she met a wise man who told her that
the only person in the world who could perform the miracle
she was looking for was the Buddha.

So she went to the Buddha, laid the body of her child at
his feet, and told him her story. The Buddha listened with infinite
compassion. Then he said gently, ""There is only one way
to heal your affliction. Go down to the city and bring me back
a mustard seed from any house in which there has never been
a death.""

Krisha Gotami felt elated and set off at once for the city.
She stopped at the first house she saw and said: ""I have been
told by the Buddha to fetch a mustard seed from a house that
has never known death.""

""Many people have died in this house,"" she was told. She
went on to the next house. 'There have been countless deaths
in our family,"" they said. And so to a third and a fourth
house, until she had been all around the city and realized the
Buddha's condition could not be fulfilled.

She took the body of her child to the charnel ground and
said goodbye to him for the last time, then returned to the
Buddha. ""Did you bring the mustard seed?"" he asked.

""No,"" she said. ""I am beginning to understand the lesson
you are trying to teach me. Grief made me blind and I
thought that only I had suffered at the hands of death.""

""Why have you come back?"" asked the Buddha.
 
""To ask you to teach me the truth,"" she replied, ""of what
death is, what might He behind and beyond death, and what
in me, if anything, will not die.""

The Buddha began to teach her: ""If you want to know the
truth of life and death, you must reflect continually on this:
There is only one law in the universe that never changes—
that all things change, and that all things are impermanent.
The death of your child has helped you to see now that the
realm we are in—samsara—is an ocean of unbearable suffering.
There is one way, and one way only, out of samsara's
ceaseless round of birth and death, which is the path to liberation.
Because pain has now made you ready to learn and your
heart is opening to the truth, I will show it to you.""

Krisha Gotami knelt at his feet, and followed the Buddha
for the rest of her life. Near the end of it, it is said, she
attained enlightenment.",2016-02-07 16:43:56+00:00,czr5e9q,1.0,t3_44ke0q,37575.0,Buddhism

601,"For some people, its entirely possible you're never going to be able to palpate or auscultate a brachial artery. It is possible that you're going to be able to hear a BP, however, despite not being able to hear or feel one under normal conditions.

For skinny people, brachials are easier to palpate because there's less fat and tissue in the way. 

Anatomy for everyone is slightly different, textbooks are ""ideal"" anatomy. You can find a brachial quickly by 1. look for the triangular bend in the inner part of your elbow, AKA cuba fossa 2. Put two fingers dead center 3. Apply slight pressure and slide them medially (towards the pt's belly button) 4. Adjust pressure and repeat while scanning up and down the inner side of the elbow.

If you're having problems finding it, you can ask the person to hyperextend their elbow slightly to try to push it towards the surface more.

You can also ""cheat"" slightly to find one after you inflate the cuff. Release air, while keeping a finger on their radial. Once you feel the radial start to thump again, you know roughly where the systolic (first sound) is going to be around. Reinflate carefully until just above that pressure and let it out a few millimeters of mercury at a time while listening around where the brachial should be for the wooshing noises.

You may need to press harder or softer on your stethoscope's diaphragm to accurately hear the noises. Honestly, I hear better BP sounds sometimes from cheap disposable stethoscopes than my cardio III.

Practice, practice, practice. If you can, go riding around in the back of an ambulance with a willing ""patient"" and do blood pressures just constantly until you get use to all the ambient noises. When you do it in a quiet room, the korotkoff sounds will immediately stand out like a search-light.",2016-02-06 02:52:16+00:00,czplyt4,3.0,t1_czpkn4u,2555.0,ems

627,"Donald Trump is a serious presidential candidate because of 2 major reasons. 1, as a former TV reality show host, he has name recognition. Name recognition is super important in politics, it determines one's electability. 

2, as an inheritor of a wealthy family's estate, he has vast sums of money. Politics is a weird industry. Unlike every other sector out there, it is short on time and long on money. Campaign seasons are fixed and so there is a deadline. To make up for that time crunch, what do you do? You spend money. On boosting what? Your candidate's name recognition, to ensure solid blocks of voters. Which Trump already has in scads.

Sarah Palin, who quit her job at governor to become a reality TV show host after her failed vice presidential run, is a die-hard conservative darling. She has national name recognition and she rallies up a solid block of conservative voters. She's a guarantee to also continue to generate more controversy, which generates free press which means a higher name recognition without paying money.

So, from a political scientist's point of view, that's why he's a serious candidate and Palin's endorsement is a good thing. As to their issues and policies, that's something else entirely debatable.",2016-01-21 16:33:45+00:00,cz6msm2,1.0,t3_4201nx,9591.0,Ask_Politics

They'll probably go away in a bit but you may have flashbacks. The more you see of death the more routine it'll become. Death isn't a bad thing, its a part of life. Our reactions to death are the painful thing. Read through this [/r/buddhism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/3v9d4m/there_is_a_dying_fly_in_front_of_me_it_is_buzzing/) thread about death and killing to end suffering. 

In particular, I find this is both important and what you may be talking about: 

&gt;You come here with this struggle. What shall we do with you?

&gt;~

&gt;You are mistaken that a 'swift boot' will end suffering. If it were that easy, we should all just die and then be reborn without suffering. But our mindstream continues moment to moment, through life and through death. It is the mindstream that is the repository of our suffering karma — the imprints of all the good and bad things we've thought, said, and done. Mere death doesn't end all that. As we know from science, energy doesn't end, it just changes form.

&gt;Many of these questions have compassion on the face, but self-interest under the surface. The motivating force is not to relieve the suffering of the fly, but to relieve the viewer's suffering as they identify with the fly. The viewer is disturbed by the thought of pain and death, and wishes to end the scene. This is the same dynamic as happens in the sometimes sappy, doting ways people express sorrow when a human dies: they are not so much caring for the deceased or their surviving loved ones as they are fretting about their own relationship with death. ""Oh, this is horrible!""

&gt;The problem you perceive is made by your thinking. For you it is complex struggle, but for the fly it is very simple. The fly doesn't have your complicated thinking; its experience is very direct. It doesn't project into the future and consider how much longer this struggle will continue. It doesn't even make the idea of struggle as opposed to any other state. We sometimes 'harmfully over-protect' innocent beings because we experience their situation through our complicated thinking. But they don't experience it that way. They are not complicated. Animals and young children are mostly living in the present moment; they don't have many of the problems we do because they do not make them with their thinking.

&gt;Compassion means first you look, first you bear witness. See the situation deeply. All beings are involved in this struggle. If you're a 'being', thinking of yourself as a separately existing entity, then you are subject to the same situation. One time powerful spirit-being, another time human, another time fly, another time hell-being, another time toad, and so on.... Universe upon universe of similarly struggling beings. This can't be ended through killing.

&gt;Only waking up will do it.

&gt;Furthermore, if we look at the karmic benefit to the fly, killing it may take away its opportunity to expunge its negative karma. It is in this form and situation because of previous causes. When those causes ripened and found their condition for emerging, they appeared as this particular suffering. Once they have emerged, that particular ripening is finished; but if they are not given the chance to emerge, they will still have to emerge in the future. In the meantime they may link with other causes and create further negative states.

&gt;If you kill the fly, you do not know that you have saved it. You may doom it to rebirth in a lower, more painful realm because of the karma it is carrying. Instead, we should generally allow all beings to work through and purify their karma.

&gt;From the perspective of your personal evolution, you should not tinker and manipulate. Interference with the process of others is ego-based. Those thoughts and actions don't align with Dharma. Where would it lead? How many beings can you 'save' by killing? This kind of interference is very low-level. For your own progress you ought to think in terms of saving all beings by waking up from the dream of life. As long as you yourself are stuck and struggling, your help is limited. But when you awaken and develop boundless compassion, there is no measure of how you can help. Really even one step toward awakening is immeasurably greater than saving a single life.

In any case, PM me if you want to go more into detail. I minored in thanatology, the study of death, dying and the reaction to death and dying and its something I'm really comfortable talking about.",2015-12-07 18:36:34+00:00,cxqirz5,3.0,t1_cxptcxh,58590.0,nursing

I started off as a basic staffing cath labs to open heart. I never got to stay for the open heart but they'll let you hang out in the cath lab all day long.

Biggest thing to remember when you transport emergent from a cath lab to an open heart is *if the cath is still in don't lift the head of the patient ever*. That cath can kill them if its torn or twisted the wrong way in side of them.

Some medics are really nervous with critical care transports others are cool with it. Be prepared to get snapped at or be looked at like they're expected to do things you don't know what to do at all. Just be mindful and tell them you'd be happy to do it but you've never done it before so please let me know how to do it. 

Be mindful of lines and medical spaghetti- oxygen tubing, EKG cables, sp02, heparin, saline, foleys, etc generally go over seatbelts. Watch out you don't kink things when you put side rails up. Sometimes its easier to disconnect, transfer, then reconnect everything depending on how stable the person is. There are different types of IV lines that could be fatal if pulled out when transferring (or close to it) so be mindful you don't dislodge them.

Dont ever be afraid to tell everyone to stop if you see something about to get pulled or trapped underneath the person during a transfer. Its better to be aware and not get things under people prior to moving.

Not smoking helps keep you from dying horribly of throat, tongue, neck, or lung cancer. It also helps you from getting COPD which is another horrible death. And it keeps your blood vessels' inflammation down, which slows atherosclerosis.

775,"Much of modern multiple choice testing is simply knowing how the test works and controlling test anxiety. With multiple choice you can narrow it down based off your lecture and book recall, your knowledge base of terms, and by reasoning in a situation. Always ask yourself, ""is this what I would do in a perfect situation with everything available to me?""

For example, lets go over some questions from an [Online CPR Certification practice test](https://www.firstaidweb.com/adult_quiz.php):

You should check the victim for responsiveness by:
1) Using smelling salts
2) Shaking him and shouting, ""Are you okay?""
3) Pouring cold water on his face.
4) All of the above.

Well, did your teacher tell you anything about smelling salts? No? I don't recall that either. Cross that one out.

Shake and shout? That sounds familiar. Let's keep that in and keep looking.

Pour cold water on their face? Well, then they'll be wet, cold, and unresponsive probably. Think a little further- you'll probably get some water down in their lungs if they can't protect their airway with a gag reflex... so let's cross that one out and go on.

All of the above. Well, we crossed out that 1st and 3rd ones so this one is automatically crossed out. Therefore, its shake and shout.

Second question: 

Check for circulation by feeling for pulse at the:

1) Jugular vein.
2) Heart.
3) Carotid artery.
4) None of the above.

Huh, I'm not sure where a jugular is but veins don't have a pulse. So that's a no, you don't feel for a pulse there. Cross it out.

Heart? You don't feel for a pulse by their heart area under emergent circumstances. Cross that one out.

Carotid artery? Yeah, arteries have pulses. Where's the carotid? Notch of the neck on the side, yeah, I remember doing that on my exam. I'll keep that one in mind and keep reading.

None of the above. Well, that doesn't seem right since I flagged carotid in my head. I'll cross out 1, 2, 4 and mark 3.

The biggest problem usually with standing fall head injury is a head bleed, that will kill you pretty darn quick.

The latest Massachusetts OEMS protocols say this:

ALS and BLS: Selective Spinal Assessment

This procedure, if used, should be in conjunction with Protocol 4.8 Spinal Column/Cord Injuries and/or A3 Interfacility Transfer Protocols.

SELECTIVE SPINAL ASSESSMENT

Spinal cord injury may be the result of direct blunt and/or penetrating trauma, compression forces (axial loading), abnormal motion (hyper-flexion, hyperextension, hyper-rotation, lateral
bending and distraction, i.e., hanging). Most spinal injuries result from motor vehicle crashes, falls, firearms, and recreational activities.

Spinal injuries may be classified into sprains, strains, fractures, dislocations and/or actual cord injuries. Spinal cord injuries are classified as complete or incomplete and may be the result of
pressure, contusion or laceration of the cord.

Individuals should be assessed and treated for possible spinal injury, and immobilized if necessary, if they have sustained an injury with a concerning mechanism, and either have
symptoms of injury and/or have a reason not to adequately perceive or to be able to communicate the symptoms of such injury.

Long backboards are NOT considered standard of care in most cases of potential spinal injury. 

Instead, use spinal motion restriction with a cervical collar and cot in most cases. Note that there are exceptions, such as a patient with a potential spinal injury who cannot be logrolled while
being transported and may be at risk of a compromised airway.

Concerning mechanisms that may result in spinal column injury:
· Fall from over 3 feet, including adult fall from standing, or 5+ stair steps
· MVC at 30+ mph, or rollover or ejection
· Motorcycle, bicycle, other mobile conveyance, or pedestrian-vehicle accident
· Diving or axial load
· Electric shock

Symptoms of spinal column injury may include:
· Posterior neck or back pain or tenderness;
· Paresthesias or loss of sensation in extremities;
· Weakness or paralysis of extremities;

Conditions placing individuals at risk to not perceive or complain of the symptoms of spinal
column injuries:
· Altered mental status due to disease, injury, intoxication, or other causes;
· Inability to adequately communicate;
· History of cervical spine injury or abnormality, or conditions causing fragile bones;
· Distracting injury (such as long-bone fracture);
· Age extremes (including &gt;65 years of age);

Individuals sustaining lesser injuries, patients who do not have symptoms of spinal column injury and do not experience a condition that would impair the patient’s ability to perceive or communicate
symptoms of spinal column injuries do not require spinal immobilization.

Penetrating injuries to the neck generally do not require spinal immobilization.",2015-10-24 17:04:48+00:00,cwbann7,7.0,t1_cwb70pl,6489.0,ems

This is the real reason why if everyone has insurance the costs go down. And the entire theory behind the Affordable Care Act is to facilitate and subsidize individuals' purchasing commercial insurance.

Short answer? I dont know.

Long answer?

My prior interactions with healthcare professionals, academics, and interactions with clients.

He says he runs 40/45km/week, which is target for endurance and marathon athletes.

Your heart usually beats 60-100/minute. There are three areas of the heart which normally conduct a beat. The top controls 60-100, the middle 60-40, and the bottom 40 and below.

Normal sinus bradycardia, or low rates from the top half of the heart, is only problematic if its symptomatic. 

Now the heart of an athlete, like any muscle, grows when it gets larger. The left side of the heart or the side which regulates flow to the rest of the body can get too large. 

The changes cause an electrical current flow change in your heart: more material means a predictable change in the normal EKG waveform. This can cause a lower heart rate than normal. But the only way to tell the difference is by EKG or an echocardiogram (soundwaves tracing doppler flow in the heart chambers).

Again, its a small chance (2.09/100,000) but if your heart rate is abnormally low with a history of endurance athleticism its probably worth a quick EKG to check its not the bad athletic lottery. You'd probably be laughed at if you brought it up with your doctor. But when it comes to my heart, I'm extremely risk-adverse since it keeps *me* alive.",2015-06-22 03:38:22+00:00,csefmku,8.0,t1_cseer7v,1951.0,running
977,"Sure.

Before I put in a link, let me tell you my background.

I've been an EMT for 5 years, I graduated a BSN nursing program 2 months ago, and I'm sitting for boards in a week. I've spent over a year working in Emergency rooms and in a critical care cardiac ICU. I've spent hours talking with midlevel and physicians specializing in cardiology. I plan to be a cardiac ICU RN down the road.

I heard this information from my advanced cardiac life support instructor when in a dysrthmia class and I followed up on it.

Now for your links:

1. Wikipedia, [Athletic Heart Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_heart_syndrome). It has tons of links in there as well as an overview but no-one really trusts wikipedia in an internet fight so let's move on.

2. [The Heart of Trained Atheletes](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/114/15/1633.long). Perhaps 15% of 'highly trained athletes' have a risk for this heart condition, with 20% remaining after 5 years post-athletic activity. 

3. [Cardiac Arrest during Long-Distance Running Races](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1106468). Its around 2.03 per 100,000 but its statistically significant. With [541,000 marathon finishers in 2014](http://www.runningusa.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.details&amp;ArticleId=332), that means 11 people died. Not huge but better chance of dying from this than being struck by lightning.

4. [Potential Adverse Effects from Excessive Endurance Exercise](http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-619600473-9/abstract?cc=y=). Endurance training should be limited to 150 minutes/week to limit the chances of this sudden-death risk.
