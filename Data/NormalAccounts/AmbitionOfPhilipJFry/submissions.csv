I'm trying to brush up on my resume to keep it up to date.

Should I keep a clinical section from my student nurse clinical days or focus on details of my current floor nursing position?

The facility has a contract with a local hospital to give the school access to healthcare record of their students, as waived by living in on campus, and to sign them up for alcohol abuse programs.

Protocols say go to closest hospital in an emergency.

The contracted hospital is an additional 11 miles from the academic facility compared to the closest hospital (let alone the other 2 hospitals enroute).

They bill for emergency level services but want us to treat the destination as a transport service and bypass the closest 3 hospitals.

What's the difference? 

Is the AI is better at continuously being aggressive and keeping the Axis on edge? Is it that the AI is better at microing? Or just doing ""irrational"" tactics (for example, single units grabbing points instead of mobs)?
