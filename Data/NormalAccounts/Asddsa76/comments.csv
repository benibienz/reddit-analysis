362,"[Hey, I made a livingrock generator the other day as well!](http://imgur.com/a/M2lnu)

I used pistons to push the stone into place, so this system makes 12 livingrock at a time. They are harvested with a bore/magnetizing lens (which, coincidentally, can break 6 livingrock before dissipating. )

I found out that the stone pushing must be stopped while the mana burst is travelling, or else it will stop. That is what the redstone is for. 

The mana lens is magnetized to prevent the burst from mining the pistons when the system has insufficient stone (the burst always curves into the mana pool after breaking 0-6 blocks.)

The obsidian wasn't needed, as pistons can't push mana spreaders.

The timer for the pistons and block placers is set to the minimum time allowed. The other timer is set to 65 seconds. (Livingrock takes 60 seconds to convert, and harvesting takes around 5 seconds.)

Note: those who want to try this with drawbridges instead of pistons and block placers are in for a headache, as drawbridges work weirdly when the block they place is removed. ",2016-07-05 16:56:25+00:00,d506ttq,1.0,t3_4rbzff,24611.0,feedthebeast

597,"Some pics from my last base: https://imgur.com/a/Bexy3

First image shows ME setup in lower right. You should watch [DireWolf20's Applied Energistics 2 mod spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzstD3eV2FI) for full details and what else the ME system does, but for now: Make a ME controller, feed it RF, and run the purple cables (ME Glass Cable - Fluix) from the controller towards your alchemy setup. Also in the first picture to the right is the alchemy setup.

The second picture is a closeup of my alchemy setup. Place down an alchemical furnace with two arcane alembics on top, place some wires next to the alembics, and place an essentia import bus on the wire, facing the alembic. You also need an essentia terminal (the purple panel on the left with a glass phial image) and a ME drive hooked up to the system with wires, and at least one essentia storage cell inside the drive. You're now done, as you can right click the terminal to fill up your glass phials with essentia (in increments of 8) and toss them into your crucible for no overspilling. 

In the 2nd picture there is also an alchemical construct above the crucible, with an essentia provider behind it it will automatically suck essentia from your ME system, without you having to put essentia into glass phials and tossing them into the crucible. These two items are mid/endgame, and not strictly necessary. 

Bonus 3rd image shows the advanced alchemical furnace and an energized node. The AAF uses the free energy from the node instead of fuel, and distills items much faster. The node also sends vis through the AE network to charge wands in the arcane crafting terminal (green panel to the left). This is very endgame.

Sinister nodes (from Thaumcraft) spawn furious zombies. They have much more hp than regular zombies, and thus feed your altar blood longer. The nodes can be transported with the research ""node in a jar"", but be careful to have 4 meters between each node, or the smaller ones will be comsumed. 

Graveyard soil and MFR conveyor belts is a good alternative if you don't want the ritual of regeneration. Place 4 graveyard soil in a 2*2 platform above your altar, and place 4 conveyor belts on them, pushing things in a loop. The zombies will regen hp from this. 

Steve's factory manager adds a block that inputs stone into your altar, for automation. It requires no power, and will only input a stone if your altar has no other items. Other input methods may put up to 64 stones in your altar at once, demanding much more blood than your altar is capable of.

722,"That's the satelites in geostationary orbit. That means those satelites orbit the earth exactly once a day, so they always stay above the same location of the earth. 

Due to the formula mr4pi^2 /(T^2 )=ma=F=ymM/(r^ 2), (m=mass of satelite, M=mass of earth, r=distance between satelite and centre of earth, y=constant, v=period), we can rearrange it into r=(yMT^2 /(4pi^2 ))^(1/3). If we want the satelite to be in geostationary orbit, then T=24 hours, and all the terms in the equation for r are determined, and the answer is 35,786 km above sea level. 

Extra fun: since the mass of the satelite appears on both sides of the original formula, it can be cancelled, so geostationary orbit height is same for all satelites, independent of their mass. Also, you see the disc because all geostationary orbits must be on a point directly over the equator. Proving this is left as an excersice to the reader.

877,"A real world application is duplicating burritos!

Let me start off by saying this: I love Chipotle. It’s a particularly good day for me when I walk in and get my burrito with brown rice, fajita veggies, steak, hot salsa, cheese, pico de gallo, corn, sour cream, guacamole (yes I know it’s extra, just put it on my burrito already!), and a bit of lettuce. No chips, Coke, and about a half hour later I’m one happily stuffed math teacher.

The only thing that I don’t like about Chipotle is that the construction of said burritos often ends up failing at the most crucial step – the rolling into one coherent, tasty package. Given the sheer amount of food that gets crammed into a Chipotle burrito, it’s unsurprising that they eventually lose their structural integrity and burst, somewhat defeating the purpose of ordering a burrito in the first place.

If you have ever felt the pain of seeing your glorious Mexican monstrosity explode with toppings like something out of an Alien movie because of an unlucky burrito-roller, you have probably been offered the opportunity to “double-wrap” your burrito for no extra Charge, giving it an extra layer of tortilla to ensure the safe deliverance of guacamole-and-assorted-other-ingredients into your hungry maw.

Now, being a mathematically-minded kind of guy, I asked the employee who made me this generous offer:

“Well, could I just get my ingredients split between two tortillas instead?”

The destroyer-of-burritos gave that look that you always get from anybody who works at a business that bandies about words like “company policy” when they realize they have to deny a customer’s request even in the face of logic, and said:

“If you do that, we’ll have to Charge you for two burritos.”

I was dumbfounded.

“Wait … so you’re saying that if you put a second tortilla around my burrito, you’ll Charge me for one burrito, but if you rearrange the exact same ingredients, you’ll Charge me for two?”

“Yes sir – company policy.”

Utterly defeated, I begrudgingly accepted the offer to give my burrito its extra layer of protection, doing my best to smile at the girl who probably knew as well as I did the sheer absurdity of the words that had come out of her mouth. I paid the cashier, let out an audible “oof” as I lifted the noticeably heavy paper bag covered with trendy lettering, and exited the store.

When I arrived home, I took what looked like an aluminum foil-wrapped football out of the bag (which was a great source of amusement for my housemates), laid it out on the kitchen table, and decided to dismantle the burrito myself and arrange it into two much more manageable Mexican morsels. I wondered whether I should have done this juggling of ingredients right there at Chipotle, just to see whether the staff’s heads would explode. 

It was in that moment, with my head still throbbing from the madness of the entire experience, that I began to realize what had just happened. How was it possible that a given mass of food could cost one amount one moment and another amount the next? I immediately began to deconstruct my burrito, laying out the extra tortilla onto a plate and carefully making sure that precisely one-half of the ingredients – especially the guacamole – found their way into their new home. As I carefully re-wrapped both tortillas, my suspicions were confirmed. Sitting right in front of me were two delicious burritos, each identical in price to my original.

I had discovered the Banach-Tarski Burrito.

1226,"Use triangles when building bridges on those phone games, they're really strong shapes. 

The triangle inequality is used in almost all proofs regarding set theory. (And I saw it used twice in the proof of Banach's fixed point theorem).

A triangle of constant width (roleaux or something) can be used as a manhole, since it can't fall down its hole. It can also be attached to a drill for square holes. And if you use them as wheels, they actually work (but not comfortably).

Lots of (infinite) triangles in a Triforce formation gives you the Sierpinski fractal. Lots of other fractals are based on triangles too, like Koch's snowflake.

Some fractals may have triangles appear out of nowhere, such as the Stars over Babylon. But where you might expect triangles, such as the Cantor set, you might find none. 

Pascal's triangle hides many useful series and useful numbers. Powers of 2, triangular numbers, binomial coefficients, and various numbers useful in combinatorics. 

The sum of the n'th natural numbers is called the n'th triangle number. They go like 1 3 6 10 15 21 28... The n'th triangular number is given by n*(n+1)/2. This can be proven by induction. 

Everyone knows of the pythagorean theorem and basic trigonometry, but here's an interesting fact: draw a circle and its diameter. Let the diameter be one line of a triangle, with endpoints where this diameter touches the circle's edge. Iff the third corner of the triangle is also on the circle's edge, then that corner has an angle of 90 degrees. This is known as Thales' theorem.

On the other hand, 1 in 5 accused were ... economic treason. The main reason was that defining the crime often was difficult. To work for the occupant was not in itself punishable. Only if the work was deemed unnecessarily in large scale and the purpose was maximizing own interests, as opposed to ""keeping the wheels going"", was there talk of punishment. Other criteria for punisment, such as membership in NS (Norwegian Nazi Party), was easier to determine.
