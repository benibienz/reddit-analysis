https://imgur.com/a/hOCVj

The core concept is the same. A vinculotus traps endermen inside a smeltery, which damages them and collects the resonant ender that seeps out. However, this version includes a ritual of regeneration from Blood Magic, so the endermen and villagers (hereafter referred to as cattle) in the smeltery are fully healed between each tithe, for more milking. 

However, the ritual of regeneration is not strong enough to fully heal the cattle. Similar designs use a corporeal attractor to pull the cattle out of the smeltery to let them heal. This is not necessary; the smeltery does not damage the cattle if there is no molten metal inside! Thus, the redstone to the side controls the flow of gold to milk the cattle once every 15 seconds. 

Note that it is very important that the products are drained from the smeltery as soon as possible. If the gold takes too long to exit the smeltery, the cattle will be damaged twice and you risk ending up with dead livestock. This is why there are two resonant servos for both flavors of milk. 

The resonant ender can be piped into casting tables with gem casts to make ender pearls. The emeralds can be piped into casting basins to make emerald blocks. 

The timer is set to 15 seconds. There are 8 repeaters, all set to 4. The smeltery is 2 blocks tall to prevent endermen from taking fall damage when teleporting. The stone bricks above block sunlight, to discourage teleporting to conserve mana.

The vinculotus uses a bit of mana to trap the endermen, denying them the ability to teleport away. 

Note that the smeltery must have some molten metal in it to begin damaging mobs inside. Here it has one gold nugget.

Each enderman bleeds out 1000mB resonant ender. One mana pearl is 250mB into a gem cast. You also get some extra by placing a vacuum hopper in the smeltery to pick up the pearls the endermen themselves drop. (Note: some of the pearls are converted into mana pearls, because of the mana pool feeding the vinculotus.)

Is your hand filled with Coldlight Oracles? Do you need a quick way of calculating fatigue damage before your timer runs out? Fear not, this is for you!

Fatigue damage starts at one damage for the first card, and one more for each card drawn. The total sum so far is called a [triangular number](https://i.imgur.com/OddlG1U.png), and it is the damage your opponent will take. In other words, the n'th triangular number is the sum of the n first natural numbers (positive integers).
 
Cards drawn| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Damage taken| 1| 3| 6| 10| 15| 21| 28| 36| 45| 55

The formula for the n'th triangular number is [n(n+1)/2.](https://i.imgur.com/wOKNpLD.png) That means: if you force your opponent to draw n cards, they will take n(n+1)/2 damage. 

The table shows us that 8 cards will deal enough damage to kill your opponent unless they have armour. 7 cards is enough if they are 28 or lower. Remember that you must first burn through their remaining deck before the fatigue damage starts, and also that they draw an extra card at the start of their turn! (This can be used to bypass Ice Block.)

Trivia: it is said that the formula for the n'th triangular number was discovered around 1790 by Gauss while he was a child, because his bored math teacher wanted the class to find the sum of the first 100 numbers. Gauss impressed the class by quickly finding the answer to be 5050.",hearthstone,PSA: Fatigue and triangular numbers.,http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3b62k8/psa_fatigue_and_triangular_numbers/
