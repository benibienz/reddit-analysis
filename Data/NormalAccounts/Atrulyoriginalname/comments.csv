That said, there is not much inherently wrong with your army design. its definitely a bit limited due to the points value youre playing at, but the core of a good army is there. I would work on building it into a hunter contingent (just about there!) and getting a big target on the field like a riptide or ghostkeel to draw fire and dish out some damage. Other than that, focus on bringing up the squad sizes for your units, a broad side here, a strike team there, maybe another crisis squad to deal with elite troops. low point lists can be somewhat unforgiving, but you can really build up into a solid list from what you currently have. Find what works well for you, and have fun!

another option is getting an ethereal in a devilfish with your warriors, making them stubborn and harder to run off the board with fnp, or a mini fireblade shooting buff! The devilfish will help keep him safe, and increase the radius of his buff auras.

  For shooting, wounds are consolidated at the closest facing to the shooting unit. So even if one tank is facing you and 2 others have their backs turned towards you, if the front armor of a tank is closest this is what you would have to roll to wound against. For allocating wounds from shooting, each vehicle must be given one glance/penetrating hit before you apply a second hull point. cover saves are determined before rolling on damage charts.

  Charging tanks is a bit confusing, And I myself do not know too much about it.

112,"Some tips on model loadouts.

I would suggest magnetizing all of the crisis suits arms and weapons. Often, they will either form the core of your army, or fill in its holes, so having the weapon flexibility is a must. You can only have 1 fusion blaster per stealth squad, so you wouldnt really need the extra blaster. that being said, it would be good to magnetize the stealth team leader to use either a burst cannon or blaster. make sure the magnets are all the same polarity on the model arms and weapons, so you can interchange them between models.

Good options for the crisis squads I find are 2x of a single weapon type, such as plasma and fusion, or 1x plasma and 1x fusion for all comers. Tailor them to suit the enemies you expect to face, and you can't go wrong.

  A buffmander is a commander HQ that rides along with a crisis squad. He has no weapons, but generally has a 2+ armor battlesuit with possibly stimulant injectors with a command and control node, multispectrum sensor suite, and sometimes puretide engram neurochip. The chip gives him the ability to give his squad tank or monster hunter, and the cnc node and mss give his squad ignore cover and twin linked if he choses to not shoot, which he cannot anyways. He vastly improves the firepower of a crisis squad, as well as its surviveability.

For next steps, I would suggest getting an hq. Probably the most universally useful is the crisis commander, which is a mainstay of many tau empire lists. after this, I would suggest getting either a broadside or two, or something big and threatening for your list, like a ion- hammerhead, ghostkeel or riptide. these are all useful units to have, and you can't go wrong with any of them.

122,"There is no ""best"" chapter outside of tournament play, although some are better than others, and most of them will help dictate how you build and grow your army. [This](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000/Tactics/Space_Marines(7E) is a great resource to use when going over the units and special rules, but I'll try to give a rundown of each chapter tactic.  

**Ultramarines:** One of the least restricting in what you take as part of your army, all of your units (outside of vehicles) have something to gain from this chapter tactic. While simple, doctrines can allow you to reroll at critical points in a game, allowing you to secure assaults and other important outcomes.

**Imperial Fists:** These lists favor a lot of bolters, rerolling 1s to hit. This can be good or bad depending on if you use a lot of them. This rule affects sternguard ammo, so having Pedro Kantor ( IF special character) lets you have objective secured Tactical marines on steroids shooting up your enemies at medium to close range, good for contesting objectives closer to the enemy. Devestator squads (both regular and centurion) also get the tank hunter special rule, so stock up a squad with missile launchers or las-cannons, and pop some tanks and other vehicles.

**Iron Hands** An extremely durable choice, All units get a feel no pain of 6+, or -1 to feel no pain rolls if they already have it ( so a 5+ FNP roll becomes 4+). In addition, All vehicles (including dreadnoughts) get an ability to roll a die at the end of their turn to try and regain a hull point on a 6+, which is nice, but unreliable. Techmarines also have +1 to repair vehicle rolls. This tactic is really nice for vehicle heavy lists, as well as having a beatstick close combat captain/chapter master, but If this interests you, I would suggest looking into the clan raukaan supplement.

**Salamanders** If burning alien scum is your thing, then look no further. All flamer models in a salamanders army get rerolls to wound enemies, and salamanders get a 4+ FNP roll against flamer weapons that wound them. A nice side bonus is that all characters (including unit leaders like sergeants)  can choose a weapon they are equiped with to reroll 1 die to hit in the shooting or assault phase, whichever applies. Vulkan makes their flame and melta weapons better.

**White Scars:**  Bikes are the name of the game when it comes to these guys. Their bikes are the best out of the vanilla codex, with a bonus to jink saves(a cover save that you can elect to use when shot at, at the cost of needing 6s to hit with the unit in your next shooting phase) rerolling dangerous terrain, and hit and run(lets you make a dice check to disengage from combat, not limited to their bike squads). Units can also choose to reroll their run dice, which is nice if there is somewhere you need to be THAT turn.

**Raven Guard** Fluffy, but I'm personally not a huge fan of them myself. Units get Shrouded first turn if not inside a transport, and +1 to the night fighting roll at the beginning of a game, making them strong if they can get close turn 1. Their lists often favor assault marines, as they can use jump packs in the movement and assault phase (normally jump pack units choose between moving 12"", or rerolling failed charges and gaining hammer of wrath wounds, but raven guard get both always).

Unfortunately I do not know much personally about black templars.

Basically, all of the lists favor certain tactics and units, with some a bit more restrictive than others. You can always swap them out each battle if you want to try something new which is nice. As well, it is worth looking into various space marine supplements, as they can change force organizations, chapter tactics, and available relics ( 1 per HQ items with generally strong bonuses). Most important thing to remember though, is to make sure you have fun with the army you design!",2015-11-10 16:33:19+00:00,cwvfpmg,5,t1_cwvdbch,3844,Warhammer40k

As for your second point, all comers lists are generally the norm for regular play. If you are stopping by a local store or tournament, you have to have a list set up more or less to play. I can't recommend most battleforces enough, although the dark vengeance is a great option to consider to start out with as well, with a rulebook and datasheets, and a similar amount of models, but lacking the customizability available to the battleforce.

Jetpack infantry is more than enough movement for small points games, and the addition of a commander will greatly increase the survivability of the crisis squad. As for the fire warrior teams, emp grenades are not worthwile unless you are using them with a devilfish to charge into vehicles. Take the gun drones off of the strike team, and attach them onto the stealth team for now. If you plan on taking a stealth suit w/ fusion blaster, target lock is important, as burst cannons want to shred infantry, whereas fusion blasters want to pop tanks, two roles which are fairly at odds with each other, not letting the weapons be used to the best of their abilities on the same target usually. If you can, I would suggest reading up on the rules for a pathfinder tetra (similar to a piranha), and proxying one of those instead of your piranha to get some more markerlights into your list.

Another good option is raptors. jump packs can cover large distances and ignore dangerous and difficult terrain for the most part, making them good for contesting objectives and getting in close to burn/melt/rip and tear your enemies. with an icon of slaanesh they'll be hitting first against most standard infantry, whereas with a mark of khorne they gain significant power on the charge,with both options being favorable for different situations. 


Heavy support wise, good options include havocs, and obliterators. Havocs are basically chaos space marines, with 4 heavy or special weapons instead of 2, so you would likely field them in groups of 5. Best bet is to load them all out with either autocannons or missile launchers.

 Obliterators are stupid survivable with mark of nurgle, and have a large amount of options for what to shoot, although you can't fire the same weapon two times in a row.

The opponent then gets a chance to deny with however many dice they choose to use, with rolls of 6 before modifiers.
