However, his previous tweets reflect that he, himself, believes that Global Warming and Climate Change refer to the same thing, that Climate Change is merely a variant synonym for Global Warming to reflect any range of temperatures.

Unfortunately, he does not understand that the Global Warming refers to minute changes of temperature GLOBALLY. Thus, it is possible that the US would be in record freezing because of dramatic shift in the jet streams that are not being corrected by natural propagation of weather patterns or oceanic currents. Moreover, the effect is most evident in the Arctic and Antarctic where few people observe the dramatic exponential change--*warming*-- that has occurred even within this decade, not to mention within the past 20-30+ years. We don't really notice it because the variation is only but 2-3 degrees, but you can sure see year-by-year impact, longevity or lack of warm/cold spells, as well as lack of severe weather (notably hurricanes).

They are making the presumption that people are going to do what they are told and vote by party than vote for person.

I wholeheartedly say---more confident than anything I can remember---that fewer than 20% of the voters (at least here in Metro Detroit) care to vote for Hillary.

The natural potential in genetically inherent and the influence/encouragement to achieve the potential comes from the parents, not the teacher. 
Going back to the subject of toys, a child's interest in a particular gender associated toy is not socially influenced at that early of an age; rather, it is naturally born interest in associating with the particular gender associated set of toys.

129,"Colleges balance diversity, grades, and opportunity (poor vs. rich districts). For admission into such a university, her grades were not all too impressive nor did she come across any barriers towards academic success (i.e a poor school with poor curriculum, delinquent school culture, and outdated facilities, and inhibitive living environment). She worked under the technicality of a provisional slot, sure, but there were far more students with *better* scores than her who were rejected. 

The one issue I have with admitting a poor, inner-city student (predom. black) is that the curriculum is so underachieving that the equivalent 3.5 to 4.0 GPA in those schools are equivalent to the same GPA of a suburban/rural student in 9th grade. My fam went to school at a private Detroit school in middle school yet when they transferred to inner city Detroit bc they couldn't afford private, they found they were using the same textbook in 10th grade they used in private school 8th grade. While it is commended that colleges overlook this facet of an inner city kid's lack of equivalent education, they shift the blame rather on the school, city, and parents. Instead of city counsel and school board or Emergency Manager extorting and embezzling the money and providing the city with opportunity (jobs), they could have the funding and thus demand for better education. When the schools look dilapidated, evident of lack of funding, it tells the students that nobody cares about education. This billows out to the streets and the kids learn that the way to survive is to hustle not learn/get educated. 

One note I picked up in the story:
I do find interesting that if 42 white students were accepted with lower scores than Fisher and no white student having done better than her according to this information, they had basically accepted all white students except for the highest scoring student. If there is some information showing that there are other white students who did better than her in the provisional slot, that would make this analysis less suspicious.

137,"US Citizen here. This is what nearly every election is like for us. I think you can understand what the power of the educated youth can do. Bernie Sanders, the most outstanding, firm, and progressive candidate we have seen in a *LONG* time (probably 100 years) has, by all public regards, lost the nomination for presidency because the youth (~80% whom support Bernie) failed to get out to vote. This apparently is not a US specific problem. This is unlike anything I have ever experienced because various regions of the US are usually consistent with voting for a specific party. By this regard, it has been the south and midwest having ruined our country when they voted for Ronald Reagan TWICE (1980-1984, 1984-1988) and then George Bush Sr. (1988-1992) then snuck NAFTA and GMO foods in during this reign of terror (de-regulation) leading to our current demise. Election George Bush Jr. from 2000-2008) was our greatest mistake. We can't forget about all the anti-progression/anti-working class Republican party (vs. Democratic/Independant party) Congress (like a Parliament) representatives to enact all the laws allowing corporations and wealthy to run the country (free tax ride, diminished wages, low employment opportunities, suppressive criminal justice system, and lack of universal health care). 

Unless our youth act and older (&gt;35) intellectual individuals help/also act, our 100 year old elderly naive voters will elect their same old politicians or act upon outdated precepts. This is what is sounds like happened in the UK. 

I think we can both agree that a rule requiring all citizens to vote should be set in place. Then again, that undermines that country's citizen's freedom. I would think a country's people realizing they messed up by failing to vote would be all the incentive they need to vote next time. I guess people are just hard headed or maybe they are so unsure and uninformed they refrain from voting. Something should evidently be done. I'm not sure as to best approach.

158,"For all metro city sports markets with all 4 professional sports, Minneapolis was the closest to Cleveland as far as years passed without winning a championship (since 1991); for a city  to have not won in any of those sports for more than 50 years (since 1964) is unmatched by a great margin compared with any metro area.  

So perhaps your specific team hasn't won in a long time (i.e. Minnesota Twins/Detroit Tigers) or never won (i.e. Carolina Panthers), but when you're factoring in other major sports as contributing to a city's ability to celebrate a sports achievement as well as generate serious revenue from the team's major success (i.e. winning a championship), it makes a big different. Okay, so the Panthers have yet to win it all despite their two Super Bowl appearances, but considering that the Carolina Hurricanes won the Stanley Cup in 2006, they can at least stake claim to that. Similar for Detroit with last championship in 2008. 

You can really only say that Minneapolis is most drought starved for a championship, but they are quite pleased not only with their college hockey success, but their recent WNBA title in 2015. ",2016-06-20 11:12:45+00:00,d4ghzar,3.0,t1_d4g929q,24686.0,sports

As a Detroit Lions fan, I know how it feels, but can't compare when *ALL* my local sports teams are failing year after year and then finally get even *ONE* of them to win it all. 

Moreover, I remember when LeBron James entered into the league in 2003. This seems like forever ago. Cleveland was claiming that he was their savior to finally break the accursed spell of failure and doom in Cleveland. It appeared they were going to get it all in 2007, but were blew out by the Spurs from Lebron's inexperience. After years of failing to amount any hope for the city, he ditched Cleveland for Miami in pursuit of not only a championship but I think more for some fresh air and relief from the pressure. With Wade and Bosh, he found instant success and brought the city to 4 straight Finals including claiming 2 championships. With his increased maturity and knowledge and experience of what it takes to win it all, he knew his calling duty to return to Cleveland to bring them the championship he so promised. He immediately got them to the Finals, but with Irving and Love, Cleveland's 2^nd and 3^rd best players, they failed to amount a championship. Returning against the same team, they were out of sync in the first 4 games and it appeared that they were doomed. The resurgent determination, effort, and mental strength of LeBron, Irving, Thompson, and crew in Games 5 and 6 gave them a shot at Game 7. They willed their way to stay tight with Golden State even when it felt that Golden State's 3s were going to bury Cleveland. Cleveland stayed mentally tough and kept going after the basket and getting clutch shots or fouls to get to the FT line. In the dying minutes, luck and energy ran out for the Warriors as Irving drove home the 3 and James clinching FT to put them up by 4.

172,"For Cleveland and LeBron to win a championship would be MONUMENTAL for the sport of basketball. 


If Golden State wins, I believe it would significantly hinder not only Cleveland's chance of winning a championship in the near future, but could force Lebron out and create a power shift in the East. It could very well spell his ultimate decline in the NBA as he would have lost the last 3 championships; Moreover, it would secure Golden State's power in basketball. It could very well create an annual powerhouse as the team solidifies into the same as or greater mold than San Antonio Spurs. 


If Cleveland wins, not only does it bring a much needed relief to the city of Cleveland for **something** very positive to happen in the city, but Lebron personally redeems his status as NBA's best player and makes up for losing the last 2 championships (3 out of last 6 championships much better than 2 out of last 6, having lost last 3). I think we can see that he doesn't care so much about his own legacy so much as getting Kyrie, Kevin Love, and his team a championship, if not truly the city in it's entirety the championship.
I think it has been a problem for the Cleveland teams in focusing on what it means for the city and fearing failing the city than in rather being a good disciplined team in-and-for themselves that, by it's intrinsic nature, brings about the championship for the city. 



In summary, the winner of Game 7 this Sunday will shift the power in the NBA: Golden State following in the steps of the Chicago Bulls with Cleveland folding possibly or Cleveland taking hold and Golden State left in an unknown state--- Lest not to forget the other teams.

194,"Men already recieve 63% harsher sentences than women and Hillary wants to make the disparity even greater. 

....and in many cases, woman aren't even arrested or bothered with for identical behaviors or actions.

1) Stalking. You will never find a girl arrested and jailed for stalking (unless possibly it is some famous actor or something). This is only for guys because they are viewed as stronger and more intimidating then girls even though the guys usually involved or accused of with this kind of behavior is of equal or less strength or stamina than the girl (i.e. overweight or skinny guys). 

2) Sexual assaults. This type of accusation is made far more on men than women. Men only act on sexual impulses more than women because the main attractive feature of a woman is her appearance and promiscuity whereas the main attractive feature of a man is his personality and success. 

Aside from this, women who do engage in sexual acts (like the girl who ran out on the baseball field and grabbed all the guys' asses) are not arrested for it. In fact, adult girls can very usually successfully engage in sexual intercourse with younger boys because of a lack of DNA but also trauma. The boy is happy to have sex because it alleviates his sexual desire (pubescent boy) plus makes the boy successful in the eyes of his peers vs a girl who is socially trained to be reserved because it is a social astigmatism to lose her virginity. Yes, you have likely seen female teachers being charged with sexual misconduct/assault so it's not entirely rare. Have you ever heard of a girl charged and convicted of groping or touching another guy in a ""sensitive"" area? Nope, because if a girl grabs a guy's butt, he usually is pleased that the girl has expressed interest. 
Even when a charge occurs (like in the instance of the female teacher), they are given far more leniency because the impact to the boy or guy is minimal. Think about this: a female teacher was arrested for having sexual relationship with a 13 year old boy. She also supposedly held beer parties where numerous young boys would come and she probably offered herself up. It turned out that the boy was okay with it and more importantly his parents. It was only CPS who intervened that brought it to the attention of the police. If in the circumstance that she pleads or found guilty, what do you imagine her sentence would be? 1 year? 3 years? Possibly less than a year with a number of years on probation. Turn this around and say the teacher was a guy inviting numerous girls to have sex with him. What do you imagine his sentence to be? Jerry Sandusky? RIGHT.

Girls are more sensitive, fearful, and reserved. Because of the police state that has now emerged, when they go to tell somebody about it, there is an immediate charge to demolish and kill the individual accused despite the actual lack of trauma or harm done to the supposed victim. Think about the '70s for a minute. If something like this occurred in that time period, the police would first determine if this was an actual rape. If this was some stupid thing like 'he felt her', the cop would ask ""Well, did you smack the shit out of him?"". Now, because of draconian laws and this up rigidity society for absolute moral perfect God behavior, they don't really care about how little the sexual act was or even if the individual had consent, they jump and snatch the offending person like a successful predator and drive them in oblivion through months to years in jail/prison, 5+ years of probation, and 15+ years of sex offender registration. Then they want to pin all your information over the media and completely destroy your reputation and chance for success in society.

199,"Actual rape and touching in a sexual area have two vastly different impacts on a victim. An actual rape usually leads to serious trauma and a real sense of insecurity that they could be overcome again, held down against their will. In touching somebody on the leg or butt (obviously less severe than genital), the person may feel violated, but it depends on the other persons approach. If they are evidently forcing their will upon that person while touching them (taking control of the person), there is significant reason for trauma. If it is similar touching, but asking that person to touch them and trying to sense that they are no long comfortable with said touching to mitigate any sense of offending that person, it is a different situation. It all depends on whether the offending person is trying to take control of the person being touched. 
I think there is something also to be said about young adult (15/16-18) and prostitutes who consent and are open to sexual intimacy/having sex, but either change their mind about the situation or denied their right to not press charges. 

I've completed a lot of investigative research on Autism and found that Autistic people really don't understand their impact on somebody in minor sexual offenses such as touching, especially in this regard. The problem stems not only from a lack of social interaction to provide for an intimate partner as well as to guide them in social situations properly, but a lack of appreciation of their environment and poor conceptualization of social cues that inhibit their realization of the potential discomfort they might make one feel. It's entirely not criminal intent by knowingly act on something they know to be wrong. 
While I agree that they can't just continue to go about doing such touching (although this wasn't something the police got involved with before Czar Dictator Enforcer Reagan the Terrible came to office), Autistic people found to be doing such a thing should be set in a medical/mental facility to improve and learn not to do such a thing. At an Autism symposium I went to a few months ago, a well-renowned psychologist working in criminal justice alluded to just this: a diversion program for Autistic people. 
That is *EXACTLY* what I'm fighting for. I think it is detestable that a young 20 year old 21/22 who has normally developed and had criminal intent would get HYTA status yet somebody with a developmental disability who has the mental mindset age of 13/14 is charged as a full culpable adult is unjust. 

You should look up Autism and the criminal justice system. You'll find that Autistics are 5-10 times more likely to come into contact with law enforcement than neuro-typicals.

202,"He obviously comes from a family of wealth. I asked a girl if I could feel her leggings and she gave me consent, but because I inadvertently touched her butt (she didn't stop or anything so that I could touch her as she so permissed), she went to the police. 
Despite any consideration of the fact that I had Autism and really didn't grasp that asking a stranger to feel their clothing is inappropriate, I get arrested and made to wait in jail for nearly 8 months before being coaxed to take a plea because I knew my public defender wasn't doing anything on the case partly because I haven't told her my side of story but also being told I could have the record removed. 

Smh. Nobody mentioned for me that jail would have a 'Severe Impact on Him' and I'm Autistic and asked this girl. Indeed, I'm thrown in there, put on suicide watch for an entire week, protective custody for a month, then set to wait in that all-concrete brick place. Being in jail with all that noise echoing from the TV just burnt me out and if it so appeared that nobody cared to do the appropriate legwork (forensic examination, etc...), how was I to win? So they then force me to take 5 years of probation plus the same registry as this guy. I think the alleged victim in my case realized that I had Autism or had a truly different intention and mindset than she realized, but never had the opportunity to rectify the situation considering I entered into a plea agreement.

If this guy had done this on the campus where I was at, he'd be in prison for life. Then again, he apparently comes from money and is probably a hot shot athlete so maybe not. 

I'm just hoping that he realizes how grateful he should be for not serving any time in prison. I'm curious about how long his probation is and how much time he could possibly do if he violates it. I can't imagine he would violate considering the absolute severity of the situation and the potential sentencing he could get. my probation agent in the one county told me now that if I violated, the judge could send me to prison. I think I surely fall into the category that it would have a 'Severe Impact on Him'. Not only am I legally innocent and was not culpable or intending, but I have already worked very diligently to go to counseling and therapy on my own terms to delve into my past but also get the message clear that I shouldn't be asking anybody to touch their clothes. 

I got a raw deal I know in of which I have been actively working pro per to seek relief from, but this guy got a very good deal on his end. This little 6 months and whatever probation might not be the end of his dealing with this. I'm guessing that the police might hound him and find technicality through the sex offender registry to put him in prison. I think it all depends on the length he intends to go to show remorse and contrition for the incident and victim, but of course to be diligent in complying with the registry.

212,"As an Autistic individual, I have what you can call a social intellectual disability. While I can excel academically, I am very poor in being comfortable with and dealing with social situations. This led to social isolation in middle, high school and part of college. I had moved hundreds of miles away to a technical school where I did very well and built good acquaintances. I did make a close chinese friend in college but after graduation, I moved back home and only very rarely hung out after that.

Thus, without any family or friends to hang out with, I went out to random shopping places on my own---Had my own car and place to live thanks to my nice job due to my good schooling---however I ended up getting in trouble when I unknowingly offended a young woman (&gt;18) when I felt her leggings (Autistic sensory perception abnormality ([Citation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9229259)) ). I had likened to wear leggings myself which, being naturally comfortable in myself vs. wearing guys' clothes, allowed me to be more relaxed about meeting people and un-beknowingly fixed my OCD interest on leggings. 

I basically evade a sex crime, SORA, or punitive consequences other than a petty misdemeanor and probation. However, from a lack of attention in dealing with the issue (no treatment or other punitive measure to re-wire my thinking), I left it to my own logical reasoning that if I had permission to touch somebody, that I could touch them. Plus, other girls and some guys had been doing the same thing to me, except blatantly grabbing my butt. Thus, a similar incident occurred about a year later when I garnered permission to touch a young adult woman's leggings and unintentionally offended her by touching her butt (essentially). I really thought that was okay so long as I asked and had permission. Again, other people had done it to me so I assumed that, of course, if I especially ask, it was right. Nonetheless, I couldn't defend myself to tell my attorney what actually happened since I had completely withdrawn from being booked in jail and on suicide watch. They just left it to just what the police wrote up as well as them including a fabricated situation where the girl (18) who turned me in [I hadn't known there was any alert about that initial incident since there was consent] she claimed a worse story even though that girl I did meet I did not touch her in a sensual, sexual or on any sensitive area. I had no idea that it was impermissible behavior to ask somebody to touch them and touching them so long as they say it is okay. I just didn't comprehend the boundaries upon such admission to touch somebody, especially since after the first incident, nobody intervened to correct my behavior. 
So without any regard to lack of corrective divergent action (rehab/sex offender treatment, even just jail time on the first incident), I'm thrown into jail 100 miles away from my family for 8 months with $50k then $100k bond when I finally give up fighting the court because my defense attorney illustrated a lack of attention on my case to defend me. Being in jail, I had no resources (psychology publications, etc...) I could use to defend myself. Plus, I was told I can get a minor sex crime charge expunged and I'm finding that the charge itself is a misdemeanor. So I plea to a single count, get released on sentencing with 5-yr probation only to find out that I can't get it expunged and that I'm registered a state DOC number. Basically, it looks like I'm convicted of a felony when I was otherwise told it was a misdemeanor. 
On top of all this, I'm thrown back in jail for 90 days on the first charge (the petty misdemeanor).
I now have an appeal with the state supreme court and plan to file a motion to withdraw plea agreement. 

I NEVER intended to do any harm and NOT a sexual deviant or predator. I have only helped and volunteered in my community, been a positive influence, and been humble. However, I lacked a proper social life and secretly cross-dressed though only with tight jeans or pants. I was socially stigmatized when I cross-dressed in college, but still was on very good terms with most people since I was a very nice person. It was just post college (2011) when I lost my ability to communicate and socialize and when the leggings trend started (2012/2013) that I was left for cold to live life.

I'm grateful that more attention is being brought to the Autism/Special Needs (ID) community for support services, and in particular, reformation of the criminal justice system to better serve the public's needs by dealing with Autistic individuals in a different manner, whether redirecting the prosecution of an otherwise non-culpable defendant or providing a better means of protection for victims (even upon the same regards as accused offenders) to place them in situations where there is good parental/caring guardian or multiple oversights to ensure their protection. 

The fact that Autistic/Special Needs (ID) individuals are prosecuted to the same or worse (Autism being an aggravating factor) than some truly culpable and sinister person is outrageous and deserves an immediate reform of the law in the same way that same-sex marriage is now constitutional in all states by federal/U.S. Supreme Court ruling. 

I know an *excellent* attorney who is pushing for this particular reform, but the legislation is bogged down by their own pride and protection from the law. 

Again, I'm just glad to see this article get publicity and that we, as a society, are talking more about this. I had only wished that when my incident was disclosed publicly to the news, that they would have mentioned that I was Autistic. Then again, they wouldn't have received any fervor to destroy, kill and punish me for life if people knew I was Autistic. Instead, there would have been a push for leniency and control, not ferocious prosecution. 
So 1 year later it is still like living in jail with the psychological torment I have been living with, except worse in this regard because I can't just do time and get it over with. It's stuck for at least the next 15 years even after which time I can't remove the record. I desperately need some sort of advocacy or legal assistance. Not withstanding, I need to see the law changed to protect these vulnerable individuals whether as a victim or offender; it's like the article said: ""There is also some suggestion that offenders with ID may be less effective at evading police and more visible as perpetrators [5] and this is the reason for increased prevalence rates.""

I'll leave on: Please support and advocate for those who have Autism and/or Special Needs (ID) as well as demand for criminal justice system reform.

Thanks. :)

Yes, I agree that the children *need* to be protected. However, there are young adult girls who convince an adult guy to have sex with them; you know very well of the kind of tramps when you were in high school. You knew they were doing something shady. Indeed, the SORA has unnecessarily included individuals who have never actually engaged in any kind of action against somebody else and those who pose no actual risk of re-offending whether at the time of offense or post-arrest/post-conviction and sentence.

The SORA is riddled with unconstitutional stipulations, and as previously indicated, unnecessarily severely threatens individuals who were never or clearly no-longer a risk to public safety. 

The SORA has never actually prevented a sexual assault. Think about it. Even where the police have the updated address for individuals (and in numerous cases they aren't updated), it has very rarely actually been a tool pinpoint a suspect in an unidentified sexual assault. If an assessment was made, I would bet a large sum that the majority of sexual assaults are committed by those with no criminal record or those with non-sexual offenses previously. 

Honestly, all the SORA does is give permission for true pedophiles and current high risk sexual deviants to remain free while unnecessarily strapping up/threatening/putting under custody individuals who honestly never or no longer pose a potential threat. It's all fear and misunderstanding.

248,"I was just thinking about this issue last night. 
Church-goers or bible thumpers always try to make others uphold the orders given by the torat (old testament) and those preached by Jesus and Paul in the gospels and letters. 
Their zealousness and captivation was meant to be bound inward not outward. 

What you'll end up seeing is that those people who criticize others hardly follow the commandments themselves while others are guided to peace and prosperity so long as they themselves heed their subconscious and wisdom/example from good role models. 

The whole idea of religion is meant to teach all persons to focus inwards and not worry about external problems. All one can be is to be a good role model in society and offer good sound advice to people. If they don't heed said advice, it is for them to suffer the self-inflicting consequences until they learn. 

On this subject of transgender persons, people do not understand the actual psychology behind their mentality. These people don't just decide one day to play and pretend to be woman. As children, without any external influence, biological boys are attracted to girls items, clothes, and accessories and vice-versa. Their mind is and conscious is formed from birth as being female, but the physical body is that of a male. Since society requires a strict placement and segregation between men and women, these individuals are left to conform either their bodies or minds towards a select gender. Since the soul of the person is more akin to a female, this person is left to make the physical transformation since alteration of the body is of relative ease. 

As far as this bathroom situation goes, people do not realize that transgender persons have been using the bathroom of whom they identify most closely to for decades and even centuries. For this to be a national concern now because one of our bible thumpers is reflecting his knowledge and zealousness outwards is disappointing. In my view, it is another means of detracting attention away from the real issues in society (such as the election). 

Church is not the problem, it is the people who become compulsed to enforce the teaching of the Bible, Quran, or other religious text upon the people instead of upon oneself. Since millions of people over the course of thousands of years have failed to achieve what the Bible or Quran have set out to instruct, people have secured themselves against religious teaching in fear and knowledge of the suffering that it has caused.

I never catch these AMA on time yet there is a schedule. Life sure keeps you busy. One of the primary reasons why people don't have time to do any research on the candidates. They are just too busy with their hobby, work, or family. Thus, a lot of people just vote for the name they hear most often. Thanks to the news, you hear Clinton and Trump, and not Bernie, most often. In that way, even bad publicity garners votes so long as their name is mentioned because people like drama, gossip, yelling, and fighting....you know, basically Jerry Springer or Maury equivalent entertainment.

Anyhow, Dr. Stein, there is no way with the current political status quo that you or the Green Party will obtain any shot at the presidency. In fact, it appears that the election laws essentially eliminates any voting outside of Democrat, Republican, or Independant parties. How do you plan to overcome both legal and mass media suppression to make the Green Party even a relevant choice among voters? 
I imagine it has to be a lot like what Sanders said in that where to initiate a political revolution, everybody has to stand up and take action.

269,"It's funny because it's basically true. 

But, there is a breakdown of liberal folks:

Intellectual researching liberals and Sheep liberals.

The educated ones are voting for Bernie because, like Trump, he is genuine and doesn't have political corporate contracts to abide by whereas the Sheep are just voting for Clinton because, like Kardashian, the vote is all based on popularity and recognition by the association to former president Bill Clinton and simply because she's a woman.

The educated liberals make up at least half, if not more, of all liberals; but because of voter suppression, Clinton is winning slightly on the Democratic ticket. The media is propagandizing that the ""superdelegates"" have officially pledged for Clinton so that she is winning by a wide margin. They are actually undecided and will make the decision at the convention. Their decision to put their name down for Clinton was before Sanders decided to run. This is a much closer race than most people think. 

If Clinton does win the nomination and Bernie doesn't run as an independent in the General Election, I'm absolutely confident as sure as 1+1=2 that roughly 75% of Bernie voters are either staying home or voting for Trump.

271,"Way late to this party but all the top comments, even the ones with gold, are petty as hell. If you didn't end up in jail as a mentally disabled person (even as neurotypical) with a serious charge or were seriously physically permanently injured, you lived a charmed life you really have and your little something has no real merit in comparison. Like comparing Earth to the size of Betelgeuse

You haven't experienced anything real until you either 
1) Went through what my mother went through: Get married/have children and the father steals from the family and blames all troubles on the family and gets ""sent off"", but despite that, does well until seriously physically injured in a car accident, given little compensation, harassed at work, forced to quit, permanent disability, all while trying to raise 2 children alone with no family support and financially locked to a house you have no means of cleaning/decluttering, but also needing to take care of father (until death), then grandmother (until death), then son and uncle after son's traumatic outfall (explained below).

or 

2) My story: Autistic and socially isolated but does very well in school. Graduates from college and finds job within a few years. Gets charged a misdemeanor for a seemingly harmless activity (touching somebody) because not having a social network or knowledge that it is something that is not permissible. Lost all money saved and relatively upset with outcome (still conviction but no jail time). Tries to brush it off by being logical that it's okay to touch somebody as long as you ask somebody and that it was just that one person not liking me. Under this insane or diminished capacity of not realizing touching other people is not appropriate and without appropriate treatment/training or social network to guide me, get arrested again because of a consensual touching that was misconstrued. This time, bond too high and without employment, not able to afford it. Under suicide watch in jail with no clothes and locked down 24/7 for an entire week without a shower or anything to do but sometimes read, withdraws until permissed to go to cellblock and then out of traumatic state able to go to medical unit. Gets to meet with public defender reps but not able to disclose any information (incompetent). Had to prolong jail 60 days for this competency examination, sent to jail cell block on 22/7 lockdown (protective custody) with only 2 hours each day to roam common area for about a month afterwards. Eventually, gains same privileges as the criminals in the jail, but everyday is a extreme hardship with Autistic sensitivities and needs where certain television noises echoed in a high-pitched aggravating matter during lockdown, lack of food to inmates, and harassment from one of the guards taking away my sweets stored for the football games. All the while dealing with the hardships of jail, I'm being required to defend myself of the heinous and malicious charges brought against me. Not only is it just the one incident, but another one was fabricated to force me to plea to the actual one reported. Since I can't do all my own legal and psychological research to defend myself, it's a losing battle and the public defender doesn't have time for me. After 7 months in jail and in the last stages at pre-trial as I'm about to take a plea, my family throws money at an attorney to represent me. Because of the outrageous phone rates ($15 to start a call), I can't call my family to figure out who this attorney is. I'm believing they don't have the money to hire such an attorney and believe he's working pro-bono or consultation. He pushes me to accept the plea deal that was already on the table. I only figure out later that I cannot get the conviction expunged, don't understand the full terms of the 5-year probation, not told department of corrections was involved, not informed of punishments regarding SORA. I was walking out the door (jail) thinking this was okay since it was just a plain misdemeanor and in 5 years it would be gone anyway, but then realize only quite later (after more jail from the first incident), all the actual implications of the conviction. All this severity for merely touching somebody.  Had I violently beat somebody with a crowbar, my outcome would have been much favorable. 
Same judge:
Violently beat somebody with a crowbar: 90 days, 2 years probation, expungeable record
Feel/touch somebody on the butt after getting their permission to touch them: 8 months, 5 years probation, 15-year sex offender registry, lifetime criminal charge.
The worst part is not only having flashbacks everyday of the whole situation and needing to bring it up *every* day with my mother about the injustice that was instituted, but how I'm being strangled by invisible chains through both probation and sex offender registry. It's truly as though I can be yanked back to jail anytime they feel like it. 


So don't bitch on here like your one petty shittiest thing was so bad. Both my mother and me have gone through ***far*** worse than your bullshit cheating or somebody pushed you or whatever (yeah, I was pushed everyday in middle school but you don't see me bringing that up).

279,"But how would we know who is a Democrat or Republican? 
If we had a non-partisan primary, the people would have to examine each individual on the merits of the person themselves instead of which party they belong to. Had the political election structure not been so deviously exclusive, Bernie would be running as an independent right now and be receiving many more votes than anybody else. With him having to choose allegiance with Democratic party, many democratic voters haven't wavered and have gone with Clinton because her name is more synonymous with the term ""Democrat"". Clinton has been a Democrat longer than Bernie and is famously associated with Bill Clinton so there is a lot of loyalty to the Clintons with the Democratic party. 

Truth of the matter is that without this whole party nonsense, we can judge the people on who they really are instead of the ideology of the party that we hope and subconsciously believing the candidate is in favor of and actively advocating for. 

These ""non-establishment"" candidates pose a real problem for the political heads because they are genuine candidates who have no allegiances and ties. They have their own (really, their own) ways of doing things, not caught up in the system and just going with the ""flow"" of things. That's why we're in this mess and why nothing has gotten changed.

When Eliza devises a plan to ""equip"" the marmasots with coconut shell body armor, the marmasots themselves can't distinguish members from one group from another. They end up fighting the same-tailed marmasots and realize how foolish they have been. 

It is great examples like this that show us how foolish, and honestly devastating, our two-party political system really is and has been for the least past 30+ years (living generation).",2016-05-02 13:03:42+00:00,d2pkqxr,1.0,t3_4hgge3,5798.0,PoliticalDiscussion

I think it has to do with these Middle and High schools with their EXTREMELY strict, zero tolerance, absolute conformist policies of any behavior that is seen out of form and out of line(like in a military drill and lineup). Then, these kids go off to college expecting the same kind of oversight and militaristic discipline. When they spot something crossing the boundary they have been indoctrinated to abide by, BOOM, they go right to the police or other authoritative figure.  

College is not a temple, church, or preschool where some mentor/teacher/priest is there to keep all the bad words out and everybody in check. College is a place for free expression and experience. It used to be high school, like in the '70s, but I guess everybody expects full upstanding, righteous, moral, Jesus God behavior otherwise demands you be cast out and in prison. People are people, they make mistakes, they do dumb things, or it's just who they are. Some people are dicks or express inappropriate behavior, but you just let them pass or set them straight. I put up with guys picking on me (literally) in grade school, but didn't run to the police because they kept trying to fuck with me (and this was like everyday; I think after a few weeks I had the right to but chose not letting karma get them down the line or otherwise the chance for them to cure of their ignorant behavior). If they kept hassling you and it won't stop and you indicated to that person to stop it, then you can get somebody else involved. Everybody is so instant shocked that they just jump to somebody in charge to squash out that person who ""offended"" them.

This is why are country has gone to hell. It is a repressive state of military and police control that has surpassed it's intention to remove violent and evil people and is now chasing down people with overdue library books. Literally, it was on the news where I live that a couple was being prosecuted for an overdue library book their granddaughter took out. It's out of control and out of line and is begging for violent protest and revolution rather than peaceful and understanding fixes, equality, justices, and right reforms for all peoples. This is what happens when the checks and balances on an institution (Justice system, particularly police and prosecuting units) with controlling power over the people have been stripped due to the conglomeration and merging of institutions occurs. Same thing happening with the financial district. Started with Reagan with his ""Trickle-down"" policies.

315,"NO!!! 
I want Clinton because she has connections and can get things done. Bernie doesn't know anybody and he'll be met with resistance. Clinton can negotiate with Republicans, not Bernie. Bernie's plans are crazy. We can't just have free health care and education. That can't happen unless it's us paying for it. My taxes are already too high. We need a female president so we can make history!!!!

Actually, I am scared of a real political revolution. While I know that she knows many people in the legislature and political circles, I forget that she has corporate allegiances and orders she must obey by. This has dangerous implications such as with fracking/environmental protections, TPP (US economical welfare---JOBS and also environmental protection), and Wall Street (equalizing the *extreme* [wealth inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM) in America). I also forget that she supports the war effort and has department of defense/military affiliations and militaristic passion. Her desire to run to war only to show that a woman can take the reigns as official commander-in-chief is yet to fathomed. I also don't understand that if you prevent corporations operating in the US to hide US profits oversees, that taxed revenue is enough to pay for all these much needed progressive ideas Bernie is setting out. Or perhaps I don't believe he has the guts, strength, and resiliency to outmatch, outlast, and outplay the staunch and stubborn Congressmen, other politicians, and special interest lobbyist controlling them to enact these policies. I guess I need proof of how he is going to go about this. I guess I forget again that it is ME who actually has to take action by forming a local community coalition to meet with my representative and *demand* they enact the laws necessary for prosperity or otherwise elect a candidate in the next election who would be willing to do these things. My whole fantasy for having a female president really has nothing to do with the presidency as it is merely a political employment position and has no intellectual basis. On this premise, I guess it is me, a girl likely, fantasizing myself as president and commander-in-chief (or similar position of power) one day and I need her to set a precedent in establishing the first woman president. That or I think her being a woman means equal pay for women and equality across the board. I overlook that if I want equality to be pushed so hard that woman would be convicted, jailed, and imprisoned in *far* greater numbers and much harsher sentences that they are now not realizing how much benefit of the doubt is given to woman as well as leniency. 

So honestly, I haven't really done any research or philosophical debate on this. I'm not much of a critical thinker and have subconsciously let my friends and family influence my thinking as well as media and possibly church. I am merely too busy with my mundane television shows, smartphone, virtual world, role-playing video game or computing, friend/family gossip, school, work, intimate relationships, and having control in my own little life to worry and care about such a boring thing as this election, especially since it just keeps dragging on and it's just getting to be old news.

318,"NO, NO, NO you fucked up there .

You are talking about a handful of Englishmen who settled in Boston, Philly, and New York. Many decades later, Irishmen immigrated to the United States because of the potato famine. A relatively few other immigrants came and settled for various other purposes. In around 1870s and 1880s, the population exploded with vast number of immigrants from many countries, especially Eastern Europe, immigrating here. It was only until around the mid-20th century that other nationalities that the great majority of immigrants were of different race such as Mexican, Asian, and Indian. The later 20th century especially showed this as true. 

So basically, except for the founding fathers and a few other vicarious englishmen, everybody else here is an immigrant. They had absolutely no ethnic, ancestral, or neighboring ties to the Americans living there. You are assuming that because they were all caucasians who came over here in the 1800s, they all knew each other or had ancestral links. Minus the distinct eye facial differences, it would be the same of me and you (I'm assuming) going over to China right now. 

You are right on one point: The comparison of European settlers to modern mass immigrantion is laughable. 
Don't forget about the late 1800 mass immigration. That was a major cornerstone in US development which coined the US phrase as a ""Melting Pot"".
You can't assume that immigration only occurs where that person immigrating to the new country is a different race of the majority of that country. ",2016-04-30 14:27:52+00:00,d2nbsyr,4.0,t1_d2nauae,2114.0,dataisbeautiful
319,"Trust me on this when I say I was exactly in your situation and things went *extremely* sour because this situation. 

Your ""people"" are pressuring you because you can get into serious legal trouble if you aren't well experienced heading into adulthood. This is only applicable if you are a socially-isolated guy. Let me further explain: 

It largely depends on several varying factors. First, whether you are a guy or girl. It also depends on if you would like to be in a relationship. Also, it depends on if you have a strong social network or you are socially isolated. If you are a guy and do want to have a girl but socially isolated, you need to get into a relationship because you need to have a means for sexual outlet, expression, and experience in having a relationship. I wouldn't worry so much if you are socially active among your large family, friends/best friends, and school/employment/club network. They'll be there to support you and the right girl will come into the picture when you're ready. Gay? Perhaps just the same. That's more complicated and I can't attest to it. If you're just plain asexual, you can just sit back and watch how weird everybody gets when around the opposite sex. 

Now if you're a girl. Don't listen to them. They will lead you full astray. All a girl needs to do is sit back, chill, be themselves, and they will find the right guy. Might not be that guy. It's an instinctual feeling. Usually a lot of girls already have a lot of experience because they were exploring based on superficial qualities the same as boys and young men. It's best to give the kindest and most timid guys stronger cues that the feeling is mutual because they are too dumb to tell if you like them. 

I really think it depends on guy vs. girl, your social network, and your own interest in finding a sexual partner.

347,"Your assessment is way off. Let me explain:  If the Sanders supporters are as knowledgeable and fervent in denying Clinton office based on the numerous infractions and malicious manipulative and deceptive measures she has taken by appealing to low information (stupid) people and denying Sander's (independent) voters from voting for him, they will vote for Trump. The whole unfavorable issue is simply based on his old fashion ways with dealing with woman (back-in-the-day culture). While he may not have a good upstanding and overly respectful approach to woman, it sure beats lying, deceiving, and cheating. That's why I not only think it may be close, but that Trump would win soundly. As we have seen in past elections, the Democrats have be very united to beat the Republicans. With such a strong divide in the democratic party (like Ohio State and Michigan or Auburn and Alabama), the united Republican party will *blow out* Clinton. On the other hand, if Sanders gets the nomination, the democratic party will be united. (Clinton voters aren't that attached and pledged to Clinton, they are merely pure democratic and, for the lot of them, are choosing Clinton because ""we need a woman president"", ""she's a real democrat"", ""Sanders is not electable/doesn't have chance of winning nomination"", or ""Sanders ideas are not tangible"". Come election time if Sanders is the Democratic selection, they'll vote for him anyhow. As stated previously, Sander's voters are not voting for Clinton based on her atrocious violations, corporate interests, underhanded tactics, and regular same old corrupt political allegiances and ties.

The people, usually zealous southerners, confuse that their representatives are likewise Christian when in reality they are only religious as Old Testament Jewish.

The problem here is that, if they really need the money, they need to manage their class schedule ahead of time to allow for a majority of days available; otherwise, they should find in-school opportunities like tutoring, etc... that offer such flexible and limited hours.

Then you have folks, of any age, who seem so sure about their stance on something.....like politics....when they have not fully conducted their research on the topics at hand regarding the candidates or research the plausibility and feasibility of such outcomes and even how the current political-financial system really works. When you fail to recognize ALEC, why we are really back in Iraq, the truth behind 9/11, and other fallacies in US politics, you fail to make the right choice at the polls....then again there is high plausibility and assertions that voters have been denied voting, their party being changed without notice, or election results reconfigured. We await and dig for the truth. 
Then you have your closed minded folks who think such things as the world is flat, global climate change is a hoax, and other clearly ignorant beliefs that have been contradicted case in point on absolutely unquestionable scientific proof (here notably the flat world folks). 
The problem is that people are very philosophical and simply rely on other peoples' assertions and assumptions to form their own opinions. As more people begin to do this, it creates a dangerous state...much like how propaganda changes a nation.....like Nazi Germany.

I guessing a lot of this material was friable (pipe fitting insulation, drywall, etc...). Even where a lot of it was non-friable, the amount of material blown to dust had to be substantial.

For those of you interested in how Asbestos affects the lung, it infiltrates the lung bronchioles and duct to embed itself into the alveolis where the white blood cells then look to exterminate the culprit. When it fails to do so (considering the material strength and resistance of such material), it creates a more significant problem as it cuts of circulation to the alveoli and thus ""kills"" it. Multiply that by several million of these microscopic asbestos fibers, and you have yourself a significant breathing issue.

400,"&gt; The people, therefore, have an interest in knowing what the State does in the criminal justice system, who it charges, who it imprisons, and why.

Basically, being nosy and fear. Then if you did do something stupid on some specific stupid situation, the public miss-perceives the reasoning, intent, and actual details and psychology behind such situations. Sometimes this fear spreads and turns into a law further punishing people because that victim or victim's family complained that if they had knowledge of some completely unique person involved in a unique incident, it ~~might~~ have helped avoid the offense. Then, based solely on this one incident, everybody committed of that offense must be tracked and if those people do not comply with being tracked, they are punished again and again. Even worse, the law is carried down to less severe crimes similar in nature. In fact, it extends so far down that a mere fearing instance of potential thought that would progressively lead to such actions based on immature, purely harmless actions, even those purely victimless, inactions based on downloading an image are considered just as heinous are bucketed together. What I'm talking about, if you haven't caught drift, is the SORA. Just for downloading a picture of some trashy 16 yr old girl who has already set her mind on being trash well into and past college because of lack of parenting, and which you will never intend to meet nor lives remotely close to you and in fact you thought was 20 something based on the miles she's run up already, you get charged with a crime that puts you in prison for 10 years max, 5 years minimum probation, 15 years of sex offender reporting and tracking, as well as treatment where you are psychologically beaten down because they *think* you are going to do something evil to that person when you really are just some normal guy just curious about his sexuality (90%+ men have porn, more in the 60s and 70s---it was encouraged actually). 

Then even without the SORA, there are crimes (life max crimes, sex crimes, etc....) that you can't expunge from your record years after your youthful shenanigans and hormones settle down and you're made entirely righteous, far more than even the attorneys and judges themselves. But everybody is going to think you are just as wild, dangerous, evil, and a devastating threat to their livelihood that they think you should be killed and murdered instantly having never believed it based on your now and possibly before that life reforming change that brought you into the stupidity actions, trustworthiness, and honesty but because they saw the background check or public search on the web. 

Truthfully, the police abuse their power to get more people into their control because it means more money for them in job security, job expansion, profiteering from prisons and prisoners, etc...; then the prosecutors get a chance to examine the defendant to really see what really went on, but instead are boasted by # of convictions so no matter if it was Jesus himself, the prosecutor will work to make him a criminal. The system is so broken that defense attorneys themselves have little time to look at the situation or person well enough to determine actual innocence so they pass you up in the interest of time and energy. 
There is no real checks in place over the police force and especially over the prosecutors. They can attack and press on Jesus as hard as they want and there is no oversight in place to limit their fervor. You can have the kindest people being held because of some misinterpreted action (i.e. stalking) or misidentity, but if you don't have money, you're a bad person (criminal). 

Case in point, the criminal justice system is so broken that removing ""transparency"" is the absolute right thing to do because a good fraction (I don't have numbers but I imagine anywhere between 10-25% and possibly up to 33%) of people with criminal records are entirely good people who did not commit a criminal act, did something not actually harmful nor potentially harmful (like weed), and in many cases, are completely innocent (wrong identity). If that person is so bad, the sentence should just be longer. Eventually they'll get out some time (less life crimes), and no matter probation/parole, their criminal record, SORA, they are going to have the same means of public access as everybody else and opportunity to make a similar offense. Tracking and everything does nothing in actuality to change somebody's behavior. Demeaning and demoralizing them only makes them more likely to actually do such a crime again. 

You do your sentence, you get released. You mess up again, you go back in (probably longer). There is no need for anybody to know what you did to get in jail because it makes no difference to know. You can and should tell just by that persons demeanor as to whether they are a good or bad person....and that has no relationship with criminal conviction. There are some very, very bad people who never commit a crime or accused because of their job position, gender, and misc. factors yet many good people who get caught up in something and they have a criminal record. 

Again, the whole criminal justice system is broken because you can't differentiate between who is bad and good with that person's actual demeanor, time passed with improvement in that persons actions, and on malicious prosecution.",2016-04-22 06:42:52+00:00,d2cs9xz,2.0,t1_d2cqn5v,4299.0,legaladvice

It does sound like pandering to the people with the same promises that politicians have long since used, but I see he is the first candidate who can really take action on this where Obama like others before him failed by negotiating and being slowly withered away from inexperience and money lobbying. 

Still, no president can make the changes that are needed. Like with the Civil Rights movement, the creation and formation of labor unions, and woman's voting rights among many other political changes, the *people* must demand the change and Sanders both knows this and has spoken directly about this--even citing Civil Rights movement--in the televised debates. 

Bernie isn't a typical candidate in this race and that's a leaning and highlighting marker for me. In the late 2000s, I noticed this Sanders guy who did all these awesome things in Vermont. I daydreamed he would run for president one day. It's incredible that this day has come, but frustrating now for me seeing that he is being swung at even by those who understand the critical importance of implementing these matters and measures; they fail to understand the requirement needed to implement these staunch positions.

If your income/wage pay increase is greater than the increase of taxes and goods/services, you are making a ***net profit***. His plan clearly works in your favor. 
It does not work in the favor of millionaires like Clinton who now have to pay more out of their pocket for these same goods/services.

It's like with Child Support. If the father (usually) makes more money, they are going to require him to pay more, but not even a majority (50%) of his incremental increase. (say, he makes $7/hr which is $1120 a month. He then has to pay 10% or $112. Now he gets a pay increase to $15/hr or $2400 a month. Same 10% is $240. While he has to pay $128 more, he still has a net profit of $1152 though he could have netted $1280 if the child support amount was fixed ($112)). 

The question now is: 
Would you rather make $2400 a month (A net gain of $1152 giving up $128) or stay at $1120 a month with no net gain in pay?

I think the answer is obvious, but with all these tax fear mongering people who uses the same logic as my father, they refuse an increase in pay just to keep a superficial required payment a low-appearing number. 

If I'm making $20 an hour, I don't really care about a small take of my taxes (10%) if that same 10% was biting at my scarce $7/hr. The reason why the pay increase for the common folk is being suppressed is because the rich don't want to services and goods to increase requiring them to pay more. Right now, everything is swell for those who make millions of dollars like Clinton where everything in our economy is dirt cheap because the majority of the people are poor. If the people are not poor, costs go up and those rich folks have to start paying more out of there pocket which clearly doesn't work in their favor.

It's kind of just more depressing I would say, especially when you know you are just as relatively broke in that world as the real world. Plus, about half the events are NeoCash driven. You think if I had real money, I would be using on Neopets? If I had that kind of money to pool around, I'd be at the club/bar/activity center/museum/vacation/casino/etc.... So what Neopets really is now is a virtual world for adults to feel they are rich with exclusive and rare items....except I can't even get that with even how hard I try. I don't know how these other people have like 2-3 of every rare paintbrush and 30 million NPs and here I am with nothing and maybe 500,000 nps busting my balls to achieve....just like the real world.....so for me, I mind-as-well return to reality and focus elsewhere.

I must revise my original comment to clarify that it is much easier to attain this goal because where the country is significantly smaller, they have integrated most, if not all, areas into the current public transportation infrastructure. Thus, where the demand for private transportation is much more limited, the goal can be much more easily achieved.

That being said, we can't use this as an excuse. Why?
Climate change dictates that we *drastically* mitigate our fossil fuel usage. Where is the capital to create such an infrastructure come from? I'm not a financial advisor/planner or economic advisor but we follow in the same direction when the US built the Pacific-Atlantic Railroad. Also, the interstate highway system in the 50s and 60s. Where did we get the funding to build such monumental projects? There we go. We have the funding, political money pigs (literally) are just withholding it because they are happy in their heaven and bliss so who cares if the people can benefit. Even with or without a public transportation system, there will still be a large (at least lingering) demand for private transportation (automobiles). With advancements in electric-powered vehicles (which was notoriously buried in Tesla's era and still underminded today), the US can very quickly deploy such autos.

I think you forgot the country you are living in. Please read:

Remember the Kobe fan back in October/November who bought his ticket for dirt cheap only in anticipation for Kobe's retirement only for Stubhub to renege on their confirmed sell because prices skyrocketed after retirement announcement? 

Yeah, I would say you two----and many more----need to file a lawsuit against Stubhub. Thus, I think you should get a hold of an attorney. You would be justly compensated, even though just like an accident or death, money never really justifies and rectifies the hurt and damage. 

Truthfully, it's as criminal and emotionally crippling as armed robbery. Yet, because they are a corporation, they skate under the chains of law enforcement and justice meant to protect the public; yet again, if it was me and you, we'd be locked away for years. Oh, also, it would be okay for, let's say a governor (* cough, cough Rick Snyder *) to do something just as egregious, if in all respects, not more so.

461,"I was in my statics class and our professor acclaimed that it was normal to get a ""C"" on most assignments and that getting a ""D"" or ""E"" was not uncommon. As you are probably well aware, these students were not dumb rather the assignments were more difficult and challenging. In that, students learned more from their failures and mistakes than they would have by ""curving"" the grading scale, easier questions on exams, or easier concepts and content. 
The main reason you get parents calling in is because so much emphasis is placed on GPA to get into college which is now equivalent to a high school diploma from ~50 years back. Parents look at this being that if their child doesn't even do well in high school, they will miss out on funding for college and have either a significant economic or miscellaneous disadvantage in college or otherwise end up in a strenuous, low-paying manual labor position. Or otherwise they might see it that the student can't handle a bad grade and get discouraged from school. 
Everything is predicated on employers. If the employers would just take talent right out of high school and train them their-selves, they would probably do just as well in most cases, if not better. Where was the need for a college degree in the 60s and 70s for a good paying job? The degree was merely supplement or means for an upper management/scientific position meant for somebody of that academic caliber. Now, you have schools directing every student towards that same position when in reality they would probably be more comfortable in general labor, skilled trade, or mid-to-basic technical work.

22 “Your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is filled with light. 23 But when your eye is unhealthy, your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is!
24 “No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money.

**To follow Jesus, Jesus asks Joel:**

Matthew 19:21-23
21 Jesus told him, “If you want to be perfect, go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
22 But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had many possessions.
23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “I tell you the truth, it is very hard for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. 24 I’ll say it again—it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!”",2016-04-05 09:48:39+00:00,d1qi3hc,1.0,t3_4dcf43,54895.0,todayilearned

488,"There is no war on drugs. It is all a ruse. In fact, I saw a reddit post on here (in of which you could probably verify) that stated Richard Nixon himself claiming it was only a means of incarcerating black men and hippies. Drug usage has actually *increased* since the ""war on drugs"" was first proclaimed. You know why? The DEA is the actual leader in drug manufacturing and distribution. Then when they decide to charge you on it....BOOM, basically everything you and your family own is confiscated claiming it was ""probably"" bought with drug money. This isn't some conspiracy. My mother, because of my father, has **first hand** experience with this. 

Oh, and criminalization of drug users is not the only social issue needing review on these same merits. Sexual addiction or sexual mal-adaptive behavior are other major issues that, in my view, needs more attention than drugs. Sometimes it is from a lack of knowledge/experience, traumatization/victimization, or other personal problems that can solved with a mental health-first approach. The whole sex offenders list is absurd and actually serves no purpose other than to both humiliate the ""offender"" and provide several grounds to continue charging them for non-compliance for the rest of their lives (lifetime incarceration). The majority of people on this list don't belong here. Usually, it is because of some juvenile behavior or lack of care (i.e. consenting to have sex with a 15 or 16 year old). She isn't some 9 or 10 year old being forced or coerced into the situation. She knows full well of what she's doing. Every situation is unique, but the law is full bent to establish that it doesn't even matter the situation even if she is enticing the guy to have sex with her, just that she is technically underage although she would just as well do the same thing the moment she turns 18. The law wants to establish a limit on age like this like it is a speed limit. Every person is different. You can have somebody 15 more mature than somebody 20 something. 
Anyhow, the whole sexual assault enforcement is in need of a serious overhaul.

Beyond these measures of mental health and health problems, criminalization of autistic persons must be handled with more caution and care, if at all. The great majority of defendant's with autism facing a criminal charge lack the mens rea needed to commit such a crime (see story on ""Paul Gordo""). That's not to say they we can't let somebody with autism or aspergers commit murder, just that anybody with this condition needs to go through a special court (mental health court) versus standard court. They should also be placed in custody under different and more accommodating circumstances than regular culprits. ",2016-03-30 04:59:33+00:00,d1iq2co,1.0,t3_4cioxg,11410.0,news

However, the converse is true. This small body has the gravitational and EM influence of a star far, far bigger than our relatively tiny Sun. Think of how big the sun is and then imagine something very significantly larger than that. Take the majority of that mass encompassed in that volume and shrink it down to, on average, the size depicted in this image. *That* is what the original publisher wanted to illustrate for Reddit.

527,"I did not know Aldi is a German grocery chain store. This makes so much sense. It's so true though about the efficiency. Sometimes the lines at Aldis are long, but because of how fast the cashiers scan everything up and then put it in the cart, it goes ***way*** quicker than like Target, Walmart, or Meijer where the cashier has to hassle with the bag. Maybe the item is too big for the bag so they don't know what to do with it. Indeed, just scan everything and put it in the cart and let them sort it out on a table....which Aldi conveniently has; really though, you're just going to have to re-sort everything out when you get to your car to put everything away. Both Walmart and Meijer made some progressive steps several years back by implementing self-checkouts. Faster, but you still deal with the bag issue, but still I believe just as fast. Target is still way behind on this, but they are more frivolous and precarious in theft prevention. Nothing they have I can't get at either Meijer or Walmart. Then again, Target is for upscale white suburban girls. I was tempted to use a more derogatory term and discuss the issue with delusional and/or demented Americans spending money they don't have and going places because it is ""trendy"" to go there. Okay, okay, I'll leave it as is as this gets off-topic.    
Basically, efficiency at checkout is important. I would imagine one day you can just go about a store and digitally buy things and once you're done browsing, you're also done checking out. I've walked out of stores---my mom, too---because the line was too long; usually during some holiday or special sales event. Unfortunately, a lot of the retail managers in the U.S. have low intelligence and/or low ambition coupled with stress, bitterness, and a false-sense of pride/attitude. They are usually the ""delinquent"" students you knew in high school who get the promotion to manager out of greed and influence rather than diligence. They use this new power they never had to control the basic employees like trash because they want to ""feel"" the power and control and are submissive to *their* bosses pressures, enduring and transferring their anger to the employees. Not to say they don't happen only in retail, it's just that this is the stereotypical place for employment hardship since the large majority of retail workers are people who have little ambition, passion, or hope of any career advancement due to lack of education. Thankfully, some do decide to progress themselves by obtaining a career they find passion in. Passion is the key word. Passion drives everything. When somebody establishes their passion, they find success. When they don't, they can end up spending their whole lives doing something they don't want to. Some do like retail; maybe their passion is retail. That is business, then. They would be likely be involved in logistics of the company and thus enter different line of work.

Plus the fact that she accepts corporate money just like the rest of the politicians (is a multi-millionaire the same). Bernie refuses corporate money, makes only some $300,000, and relies on the people. He's stood against segregation and got arrest for it. Hillary supported Goldwater who opposed the civil rights act. Yes, she did convert later on which is good, but still the dramatic action Bernie took told me at heart that he is fighting for the people. His plans are not farfetched. His policies he is advocating to implement merely emulate European policies (the ""dreaded"" socialism everybody exclaiming against). 

Everybody is going to be skeptical that he can implement these progressive changes. Many say that Hillary's plan is similar if not better and that she has more means of implementing those changes. I'm not sure how she has more leverage though I do know she has more obligations to corporate and shadow interests since she's willing to take their money so freely.  All that aside, Bernie's platform is predicated on the idea that the people actively (through protest, demonstration, etc...) demand change. The people demanding real change is what creates actual action, not by bureaucratic methods. Same happened with labor union rights in the late 1800s, the popular civil rights movement, woman's suffrage, gay marriage rights, etc... When the people sit back and hope things work out, they don't. You have to be active in change. Honestly, at least where I live, there aren't any stages, protests, or demonstrations like you see in Europe. Everybody is too busy surviving/slaving or distracted by technology.

Anyhow, I was going through some legal turbulence that messed up my sleeping schedule so I would usually start work somedays around noon-ish, though I would work all through the night. So even though I was scheduled to work regular 8 hours from 8-5, I usually worked noon to midnight. The extra time was for their benefit in return to work at hours at my leisure. It really made the job worth it and my supervisor evidently didn't mind. This was justified in part because the tasks/duties of my position could be fulfilled/completed remotely (database analyst job), we had global operations, and I organized the data in a very efficient matter better than anyone else both online and compiled as a filterable, well-illuminated spreadsheet. So I would assist in Asian operations which actually really did need the most consideration. US operations (business department I worked under to assist) hadn't probed me specifically on any time-working issue plus I provided them assistance on direct rarely did I find that the time irregularity was an issue. It all went fine until after a couple days after my supervisor resigned (possibly forced) I was let go. It is my understanding that the new supervisor/boss sited an issue where I was late to a special work event where I was asked to input data from feedback (transfer information from paper to computer). I didn't have the correct start time and wasn't sure where the location was. Operationally, my tardiness didn't delay any work flow process as I was able to input the data from paper fast enough to equate to just as they handed the paper in. The new boss basically didn't know me all too well or was more strict on procedural operations.  To this day, I'm still not quite sure why to this day why my supervisor resigned or forced out. I really enjoyed putting together the data as a colorful spreadsheet for the business department managers I worked for.

574,"Environmental Engineering graduate here (interest in Atmospheric Sciences and Astronomy): In high school and freshman year, were you casually social (extrovert personality)? If not entirely so or even if so, maybe you have Asperger's Syndrome. If perhaps not a genetic disorder, I'm guessing a situational/circumstantial issue. In any sense, it appears that as you excelled in your college courses,  added responsibility would pose little burden. As you incrementally added responsibility without stabilizing the initial added responsibility, your ability to control all responsibilities simultaneously has resulted in your collapse. Your realization of failure in all the responsibilities has left you paralyzed emotionally. I'm not just speaking out of speculation, I've already been through exactly what you've been through plus more than you could imagine to occur after graduation. My experience in brief is that I succeeded in my first and second years primarily. I had one notable class that I didn't do so well in partly due to oddity and difficulty of the class, but also because I was getting involved more in clubs, enterprises, and such. In my third year in college, I hit a brick wall. I had signed up to be president of the tennis club, treasurer of another club, and team leader in my enterprise in addition to all my coursework, which at this stage became harder (notably as I was getting into my core classes). I also moved further from campus (another mile, I have no car/transportation--It snows about 300 inches a year). My grades and my health noticeably declined. I informally resigned from team leader and delegated responsibility as president (I had founded the club so I still wanted to be president to see it through). Anyhow, I somewhat limped on in the second semester and got good grades in all my classes, except failing one because I just decided it was too much and it was too late to drop. The next year went really well as I let somebody else be president of the tennis club and shifted off a lot of that responsibility. I also moved closer to campus. I got on the dean's list the next semester as well as basically so the second semester 3.47 (close enough). I got an AB in that failed class. 
Don't let your failure be your demise. It's like what Alfred and Bruce Wayne's father said: ""why do we fall? so we can learn to pick ourselves back up."" But also it's a lesson to understand your limits. Hopefully this helps. Perhaps the issue is deeper. Anyhow, whatever it is, I'm in emotionally paralyzing situation that I have only been able to deal with in the past month or so after going 6+ months of retreat. So I understand where you're coming from with that. What I gained from this is that nothing gets done unless you act. Otherwise noted, faith without works is dead. For me it was a situation change that more or less I believe forced my hand to deal with it. 
Perhaps you might want to consider taking a semester or 2 off; maybe go study abroad (if you have the money or can get grant/scholarship for such). While I totally understand this is something you probably really don't want to do, it could really help out. Explore your options. Listen to wise counsel and do what feels right.

According to data from the nonpartisan group Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ), GE posted $33.9 billion in U.S. profits, yet somehow ***got*** $2.9 billion in ***refunds*** in that same time period. Same thing with Billionaires who either receive their income in capital gains (non-taxable) or hide the money offshore. This leaves the common people to pay the majority of the taxes. 

When the economy is made just and fair, this means higher pay or lower cost of goods, more people employed, more services rendered. This outweighs any other issue.

593,"""Americans are also considerably more religious than Western Europeans""

I don't think so. American Christians are simply more evangelistic and zealous about their religious practices. They want the government to ensure that every citizen is abiding by biblical teaching, when in essence, the USA is a country *founded* on religious freedom. To force all to abide by Christian practices works directly against the very first constitutional right of all citizens. That is why issues like homosexuality and abortion cannot be made illegal and why the Supreme Court will always rule against any such motions or cases. It is clear that the Republicans want to abolish this first amendment right (Trump notably in banning muslims and Cruz/Rubio et al. in abolishing the right to abortion). If you're a patriot (one who believes in protecting our constitutional rights), you will vote Democratic....notably Bernie Sanders. Didn't mean to turn this politically-oriented, but by process of elimination, this is who we come up with. Until further information is provided/additional research is provided, this is who I would vote for. In this campaign, I simply urge everybody to 1) research and learn about the candidates and 2) talk to others in the store, school, gym, club, work, etc... See, most folks are afraid engage in political discussion in order to avoid potential confrontation and argument which they may feel could escalate to fight or another because of being closed minded. Truthfully, it is simply a matter of learning. If somebody has an argument and you can't find a proper response to it, that is a good time to google that response and do your own research. I'm willing to change my vote if somebody can provide a solid example of why I should vote otherwise. We can have a good debate, learn some things, and possibly reach a mutual agreement. 

Never settle. I just hope you are surrounded by a diverse minded group and not so overwhelmed with work/school that you have little time for a casual conversation.

Primarily, anyone making more than $200,000 a year. Is that you? No it's not (*highly* unlikely). Then again, if you *are* making that much money, the net income you generated is still **FAR** greater than what most of us make...*for the same energy input of work*. Be lucky you don't have to work as hard as some manual laborers in this country making less than $10 an hour. The difference I see between advancing oneself (getting a bachelor's, master's, or even Ph.D.) and high school to college dropouts is that for about the same amount of pay (actually, well-educated folks making 2 to 3 times more), they have to exert less energy each day. The inequality of wealth is beyond what people can comprehend. Some people are in fact literally on vacation enjoying themselves in leisure making 1000s of times more money than somebody busting their balls making about $10 an hour because they were either born rich or found the crack in the economy (wall street antics) to get ahead and leave us behind. 

I think everybody should be required to work to make money and it's that simple. That's a very republican view and that's what Bernie is actually trying to insist in regards to the ultra wealthy.

610,"Even as an environmental engineer, I often times forgot how essential clean and safe drinking water is with our American standard of living. The easiest way to be reminded of this is during a power outage. You can't merely turn on your faucet for a running water supply to wash your hands, wash your dishes, shower, drink water, or to urinate/defecate in the custom fashion (toilets). 
Surely, no problems regarding toilet usage; yet, I suppose the citizens are still using the contaminated water to wash themselves or at least their hands/dishes while using bottled water for drinking. Though, noting how corrosive the water is, I have to imagine that people will likely quit using the water altogether, if they haven't done so already. Supplying the bottled water to the ENTIRE city of Flint is like applying a bandage (band-aid) to a chopped off arm, not a mere cut or incision wound on the arm. My guess would be a mass migration to outer sections of the county and local cities (Lapeer/Davison, Owosso/BirchRun/Saginaw, Grand Blanc/Holly). I suppose if it wasn't for this cold, people would be walking away already. Plan on seeing a mass exodus from Flint come spring/summer. To stay in Flint would be ignorant of the parents putting their children at further risk. Doesn't matter if they don't have the finances. How did immigrants make it to America?

As far as resolving the issue of the contaminated pipes, either the water treatment plant (distribution supply center) can inject a dilute base to react with the precipitated lead to flush it out of the water supply---which would mean a long standing spike in lead concentration that would force ALL users to discontinue use of water supply which is dangerous, not logistically feasible, and not rapid enough---or otherwise replace all the pipes; the latter seems, as we've heard well enough on the news, to be the more feasible solution. 

thanks Snyder. Instead of hiring these criminal business ****** (as George Carlin notably coined), can't we instead hire somebody of intelligence and integrity? Somebody who has little interest in money/greed and politics?",2016-02-11 06:38:53+00:00,czvrqws,1.0,t3_4546lb,43561.0,pics

Car insurance on the other hand is hardly a necessity. I do believe that each person should have an account with insurance in-so-where you pay the cap (say $40,000), you don't have to pay anymore. In Michigan, you have to pay $125 to cover ""uninsured drivers"". Does that make any sense? Basically, people in Michigan have to pay insurance extra $$$ for somebody committing a criminal act?! Then if they do hit somebody, because of ""no-fault"" it is insured driver's insurance that is supposed to cover them (you know, ""no""-""fault"").

George Carlin's Final Words To The World...
""There's a reason education SUCKS, and it's the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed. It's never going to get any better, don't look for it, be happy with what you've got. Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the REAL owners, now. The REAL owners, the BIG WEALTHY business interests that control things and make all the important decisions -- forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. YOU DON'T. You have no choice. You have OWNERS. They OWN YOU. They own EVERYTHING. They own all the important land, they own and control the corporations; they've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State houses, the City Halls; they've got the judges in their back pockets, and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all the news and information you get to hear. They gotcha by the BALLS. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying -- lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want -- they want MORE for themselves and less for everybody else. But I'll tell you what they don't want. They DON'T want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. They're not interested in that, that doesn't help them. That's against their interests. That's right. They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they're getting FUCKED by system that threw them overboard 30 fuckin' years ago. They don't want that. You know what they want? They want OBEDIENT WORKERS. OBEDIENT WORKERS. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passably accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it. And now they're comin' for your SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY. They want your fuckin' retirement money. They want it BACK. So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street. And you know something? They'll get it. They'll get it ALL from you sooner or later -- 'cuz they OWN this fuckin' place. It's a big CLUB. And YOU AIN'T IN IT. You and I are NOT IN the big club. By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long, beating you over the in their media telling you what to believe -- what to think -- and what to buy. The table is tilted, folks. The game is rigged. And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good honest hard-workin people -- white collar, blue collar -- doesn't matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-workin people CONTINUE -- these are people of modest means -- continue to elect these RICH COCKSUCKERS who don't GIVE a fuck about them. They don't give a fuck about you, they don't GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU. T HEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU -- AT ALL. AT ALL. AT ALL. You know? And nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care ... that's what the owners count on, the fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes every day. Because the owners of this country know the truth -- it's called the American Dream ... 'cuz you have to be asleep to believe it.""",2016-02-07 20:59:17+00:00,czreko7,1.0,t3_44nii8,303.0,politics

Historically, is autism more prevalent in recent times due to such environmental factors or is it a matter of discovery by and which autism has been around for centuries merely not established as a mental condition in society? If autism is a newly generated ""illness"" or condition of modern workings, how can we be so sure it is a result of vaccines? Perhaps autism is the result of other toxins in our environment (air, food, water, etc...).
