The whole unfavorable issue with Trump on women is simply based on his old fashion ways with dealing with woman (back-in-the-day culture). While he may not have that ideal upstanding and overly respectful approach to woman society expects from the ideal male, it sure beats all of Clinton's lying, deceiving, and cheating in many intellectual progressive Democratic and Independent minds. That's why I not only think it won't be close, but that Trump would win soundly. As we have seen in past elections, the Democrats have be very united to beat the Republicans. With such a strong divide in the democratic party as it is right now I find (akin to Ohio State vs. Michigan or Auburn vs. Alabama), the united Republican party will *blow out* Clinton. On the other hand, if Sanders gets the nomination, the democratic party will be united. (Clinton voters aren't that attached and pledged to Clinton, they are merely pure democratic and, for the lot of them, are choosing Clinton because they feel ""we need a woman president"", ""she's a real democrat"", ""Sanders is not electable/doesn't have chance of winning nomination"", or ""Sanders ideas are not tangible"". Come election time if Sanders is the Democratic selection, they'll vote for him anyhow. As stated previously, Sander's voters are not voting for Clinton based on her atrocious violations, corporate interests, underhanded tactics, and regular same old corrupt political allegiances and ties. 

My finding of Trump is that we aren't sure what exactly he will do (he's not making the same old promises because a lot of what actually gets done has to get done through Congress, which is in a complete upheaval and stand-still) though, at least for, he is genuine. It's human perception, you can see that both Sanders and Trump are genuine candidates because they have no political (and corporate for that matter) allegiances and ties they must obey. They have their own personal plans. That means change in any regard. This is why Reddit has subreddits for both Sanders (/r/Sandersforpresident) and Trump (/r/The_Donald). It's quite obvious for many intellectual and predominantly young people that I know that they are voting for either Sanders or Trump. It's these old, lets-keep-everything-the-same-because-I-am-too-scared-for-real-change people who vote for Clinton and then complain when nothing gets changed. A scary world we live in.

The collect call phones provided cost $15 to start. All my family lived 100+ miles away and didn't have a lot of money. My immediate family had no money to spare and I rarely talked with them. My other supporting family sent money for me to eat so that I wouldn't starve on the survival portion meals provided. My actions warranted so such psychological abuse that I would have to be locked up for months at a time (8 to be exact). I couldn't afford bail (it was a fucking richy uppity town) and was given no leniency. Partly this was due to the fact that I wasn't defending myself with the public defender I was pushed into representing me (what other choice did I have if my family couldn't afford one?). I wanted to talk with my mother more often to work up explaining what really happened (being granted consent to merely touch somebody's clothes), but felt terrible that I had to cost her $15 that she didn't have to talk with her. Thus, at the latter stages when she did hire somebody to represent me, I couldn't call her to find out my grandmother paid in full for representation because I knew the amount to call was too expensive. 

After I was released, a month later I was incarcerated in another jail on probation violation (due to this) for a first offense, but was able to speak to my mom more often because the rate was cheaper ($2.25 then $0.25 per minute). I could call for a few minutes and it's only $4-5 not $15. 

This violated my rights to a defense especially since I have a mental limitation (Autistic) and needed to confer with my family about what happened, but was shunned and punished further when the company extorted money from my family to speak to their deprived son. 
It is completely ignorant, unethical, and truly criminal to charge accused innocent persons an extortion amount of money for a telephone call when the most violent of criminals in prison serving life or on death row can call their own family's for pennys to a dollar. 

I demand reform and want to take the first steps in equating this injustice. 
Because of this extortion, I was not able to find out that my family hired this attorney in full and that he wasn't just working on a consulting basis. It was on my limited knowledge that I ended up taking a bad deal incorrectly figuring they aren't even paid to represent me. 

I'm looking for the right form in Michigan for a lawsuit against them or to take addition measure.

Click ""Call"" or accept and set your phone to rest. Everything is taken care of on-screen with a script and everything. I'm quite shy with having Autism and living in a socially isolated family, but you should know how important this is. That's why I'm forcing myself into the fire on this. I imagine you're more comfortable with this whole process so give it a whirl. Once you get into it, it's not as scary as it might seem. If you want to contribute another way such as rallying your community or neighborhood block party, even better. You can't expect a result by just commenting on the internet. I don't know where these Hillary supporters are coming from but I have to imagine she's getting her work done through advertisements and backing from religion claiming that Bernie is not worthy because he is Jewish (my stipulation why she won the south vote by such a high margin). Well, Jesus is King of the Jews and salvation was made first to the Jewish; everybody is a gentile. Yet this political race is not about faith. If that is what some are standing on, you can't expect just anybody who claims to be of Christian denomination to follow in the way. Dick Cheney can claim to be a Christian yet commit very immoral and illegal actions as he has done. Perhaps it's his claim of being a socialist. This really gives me a headache. Probably a bad migraine to the extent I want to hit myself. Socialism ***HELPS*** the people. At it's foundation, it ensures that the money is distributed **equally** to everybody, and not promoting greed as you would find in a capitalist country like ours. Exaggeration?

It cost about $4000. I paid if off completely about 2 years ago pr so and infrequently used my card. In the last year, I used it only about a handful of times yet I always paid on time; I eventually paid it entirely off on a number of occasions. Only just recently in the past month am I in a crunch and needed to put many things on the card to space out my payments for such things. However, it was just this past month Jan 2016 that my card expires. I never received a new one and called the bank/customer service and they just said I had to wait and that my account was under review. (?) I feared it wasn't going to be renewed because of the past inactivity. 

My question is if the bank is not going to renew a credit card, don't they need to provide at least a general reason why it is not being renewed so that I may remedy (if at all necessary) any problem either with my credit or otherwise. I'd at least like to know if it was because of my inactivity. Then at least next time I would know to use my credit card more often next time issued one.
