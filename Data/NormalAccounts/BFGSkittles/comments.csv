30,"My ratings:

David Warner: 4

Slashed at a wide one in the first and was caught at slip, but looked good for 45 in the second innings but was very unluckily dismissed.

Joe Burns: 1

Get a 1 for the 1 run he scored. Could argue was unlucky to be caught down leg side in the second innings.

Usman Khawaja: 6

Second innings top scorer with 64, which was the only half-century made by an Australian this test. Only Smith faced more deliveries than Usman.

Steve Smith: 6

The only untroubled batsman from the first innings. Added another 31 in the second innings, faced the most deliveries of any Aussie batsman this test. 

Adam Voges: 1

Another two fails for the under pressure old man. Has just 30 runs this series @7.5. Wouldn't surprise if he gets dropped for Adelaide. 

Callum Ferguson: 1

His debut test isn't going to be one he remembers. Run out in the first innings then fell for 1 to a ball that kept low in the second. You would hope he isn't made a scape-goat and gets another chance on his home deck next test.

Peter Nevill: 1

Two failures with the bat, and a missed stumping. Like Voges, his spot in the team is under serious threat, but I think his unbeaten 60 from the first test earns him another chance.

Joe Mennie: 3

The bowler that got over the line due to his batting prowess actually looked better than most of our batsman in the first innings where he scored 12% of the team's runs. Didn't bowl terribly, but didn't look overly threatening either. Like Ferguson, hopefully isn't a scape-goat and gets another chance.

Mitchell Starc: 4

Went on a rampage late on day 1 but that was pretty much it. Disappointing with the bat, even by his standards. 

Joshua Hazlewood: 9

Clearly our best player for the match. 6 wickets in a test where only bowl once is pretty good. 10 of his 30.5 overs were maidens. Wasn't the worst with the bat either, with scores of 8 and 6*. I don't think he personally could have done much more.

Nathan Lyon: 1.5

Wasn't effective with the ball, was wicket-less (although there was a missed stumping from Nevill). They had a stat on the radio saying something like he's gone more than 60 overs since his last test wicket, so his spot in the team isn't guaranteed.

38,"Ok so I'm in a bit of a pickle...

Two of my best friends got married 4 years ago. I'm more friends with the girl, but I've known them both for almost 20 years.

The relationship dissolved so much that it resulted in several cases of domestic violence. Shoving, yelling, pushing, breaking things, etc. Even yelling and being aggressive towards their three young kids. He started saying things like 'Having kids ruined my life, you ruined my life', etc.

Turns out he has anxiety, depression, and signs or autism and Asperger's syndrome. She tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. They tried help programs, they've tried medication, things become good for a while, but something so trivial would trigger him again.

She came to me for help/advice several times. I gave her advice. 
Thing is, around everyone but her, he's perfectly normal. He's quiet, nice, respectful, talkative, and never raised his voice or fists in anger. 

So, I was always caught in the middle. In no way at all did I ever justify or defend his behaviour, but at the same time, I thought staying friendly with him would be the best thing to do in the situation, and that's what I wanted, I wanted to do what would be best for all involved. I figured just ignoring him would just end bad as he would think his wife turned his friends against him, and he'd become violent again.

Several times it got to the stage where she was like 'We're done, it's over, we're divorcing, he's moving out, etc.'... And she gave me ultimatums: Stay friends with him, you're not my friend. 

That's fine, I get that, but then a week later she posts happy family snaps on facebook and tries to organise times for all of us to catch up, as if everything was fine again? So I'm like, OK, obviously things are good again so I'm allowed to be friends with him again?

This has happened a few times. The most recent was just a few weeks ago, she told me it was over between them, I was ready to slowly let my friendship with him go, but the same again, happy snaps on facebook, and she texted me to organise a time for all of us (including my Mrs.) to catch up! 

But then yesterday I get another ultimatum. She's deleted me from facebook. I keep getting all these mixed messages. I don't want to end my friendship with him, then a week later they've kissed and made up again, then I'm allowed to be friends with him again?

What the fuck am I supposed to do here?  ",2016-11-14 22:28:10+00:00,da0fn6u,1.0,t3_5cye2t,5026.0,AFL

93,"I had this discussion with a friend at the time (around 2012?), and I was anti-Marsh, he was pro-Marsh. He claimed Shaun Marsh had the best technique of any batsman in the country (mind you, this was around the time Clarke was peeling off double-tons left, right, and centre).

I was like... Really? Best technique? The same 'best technique' that had a Sheffield Shield average &lt;40 over almost 10 seasons?

So he was in the test team, against NZ I think and he got like 17 runs in 3 tests... Every time he got out I would text my mate 'So it looks like Mr. Technique failed again'.... 

Yet for some reason, unless he was injured, he seemed to be ALWAYS in contention to be in the team. They overlooked young blokes that they could have developed, and also overlooked mature players who were better batsmen in better form (Klinger anyone?) in preference to Marsh. I just don't get it.

The OP is right, he would look glorious peeling off a huge hundred, then it would be followed by a string of single-figure scores. 

And now look, he gets back in the team, ahead of a younger player like Burns, whose test average is a respectful 41, and ahead of a younger player like Handscombe or Bancroft. 

And, while he managed to survive last night, he looked awful. He got hit on the body, he got squared up at least a dozen times? Ol' 'Greatest technique in Australia' huh? 

He may go on to get a hundred. He may do well this test, but I can guarantee you he will have the usual string of bugger-all scores to follow. ",2016-11-03 21:23:35+00:00,d9kkkub,4.0,t1_d9j8bv8,74075.0,Cricket

103,"1. We seemed to play better footy against the better teams. We beat finals teams Geelong, GWS, and West Coast. We put up a decent performance against the Crows in Adelaide, almost knocked off Hawthorn, and almost knocked off the Bulldogs twice.

2. Conversely, we had our worst performances against non-finals teams, many games we were favourites in. We got spanked by Port at the MCG, Melbourne twice, and St. Kilda, and also lost to Carlton. So very inconsistent.

3. The players that stood up the most were Pendlebury, Sidebottom, Treloar, and Grundy. Grundy really took a step forward and I think he'll be one of the best ruckmen next year. A lot of the young guys stepped up at times too; Wills and Phillips look like great prospects.

4. The second tier experienced players let us down. Brown, Frost, Williams, Cloke, White, etc. We needed more from these guys.

5. The biggest thing we need to address before being considered a finals threat is our ball use. Skills are poor and the decision making with disposals in the forward half were terrible. This was evident by how easy it was for team to score from turnover against us.

6. The trade period was... average. Wells provides a good ball user/decision maker, and while I'm not unhappy about getting Mayne, that four year deal is just awful business.
I thought we should have gone after Eric Mackenzie considering we lost Frost, Brown, and Marsh and only brought in Lynden Dunn.

Growing up in the Moorabbin area there were a lot of St. Kilda supporters at my school, so naturally I wanted to go for them as well... Dad barracks for Hawthorn and didn't really care who I went for, but Mum did. She barracks for Collingwood. 

So my Mum offered me a 'deal'...

If St. Kilda could beat Collingwood the next time they played each other, I could barrack for St. Kilda... If Collingwood won, I would barrack for Collingwood... Seemed fair to 5 year old me right?

Low and behold, Collingwood thumped St. Kilda... Little did I know at the time (1991) that Collingwood were a pretty decent team, fresh off a premiership the previous year, and St. Kilda were like the Brisbane Lions of the early 90's... So Collingwood were never going to lose, and my Mum knew that...

My biggest vices are chocolates, fried food, and chips/biscuits. Makes it so fucking tempting when there's a Macca's AND KFC literally 2 doors down from my work...

The good points are I actually don't mind walking, that's going to be my main mode of exercise, and I have an exercise bike at home. 

Also, I've done this before a few years ago, went from right on 100kg to 90... I'm fairly tall so I was happy at 90... But I've ballooned out past 105 and I'm getting short of breath doing basic tasks so I've gotta do something. Wish me luck.

288,"Collingwood supporter here.

As much as I would love them play finals again, I honestly don't think it will be 2017.

The only way we'll push for a 5-8 spot is if we get something we haven't had in a while - a good year with injuries. We played 39 players this year and that's not conducive to playing consistent footy.

Speaking of consistent footy, that is actually what I want to see from us next year. We had some really solid efforts against most of the top 8 teams this year, but had some absolute stinkers against teams we had a chance at beating.

Ball use has been a massive concern for us in recent times, I want to see turnovers and unforced errors reduced. 

I worry when I look at our forward line though. Darcy Moore is a star but he's still a kid and it's a tough ask for a kid to be the number 1 guy and carry the forward line. Our most dynamic forwards are Elliott and Fasolo, and both have their injury concerns. 

The midfield I'm not too worried about because we have guns like Pendlebury, Treloar, Adams, and Sidebottom, as well as young players like Wills who will be guns. Grundy is just reaching that age where ruckmen really start to dominate, and he showed signed of that this year.

Defensively I'm not overly concerned as long as Ben Reid is up and running and Ben Sinclair can stop getting KO'd. 

There are other modes of 'improvement' other than increasing your win tally. I honestly expect roughly the same next year though, but with a slightly easier draw and maybe a bit of luck we might push 12-13 wins and sneak into the 8, but more realistically I think 9-10 wins is on the cards.",2016-09-06 22:45:07+00:00,d7c2uof,1.0,t3_51f5de,33991.0,AFL

- Adelaide's surge towards top 4;

- GWS debut finals berth;

- Geelong to return to finals (that was easy to predict though);

- Not buying into my own teams good pre-season form.

What I got wrong:

- I had the Bulldogs having a 'crash back to earth' season;

- I had North dropping out (I was about 10 games too early with that call).

- I thought Freo would remain a top 4 side based on winning nearly all home games and Nat Fyfe having another Brownlow year;

I'm pretty sure I'll go with the 'adds BB gauge boost when attacked effect to BB/SBB' and then spending the extra 10SP to make it stronger, which leaves me 40 points to spend.

The 30 point option of making normal attacks AoE is basically only useful in arena right? I'm not really tempted by this...

So it kinda leaves three options:

- Get the 'adds BB gauge boost to BB/SBB';
- Get the 'boost light elemental damage effect added to BB/SBB';
- A combination of 'turn end effect at start' + 'BB fill when attacked (self)'.

938,"I'm convinced she has turns where she's near-on immune to being cursed...

I tried this set up just for the hell of it:

Elza/Gazia leads, Semira, Dilias, Paris, and Nyami.

- Semira has an 80% chance to curse;
- Dilias has an 80% chance to curse:
- Elza adds curse to party (10%);
- Elza BB has a 45% chance to curse.

Going by probability, the odds of not one of the party inflicting curse when it's been added to the party and using Elza's BB:

1/5 x 1/5 x 11/20 x 9/10 x 9/10 x 9/10 = ~1/62.

Even if she has 50% resistance, that's roughly 1/31 chance not to curse...

Yet the actual curse rate, at least from my experience is about three-quarters, meaning it doesn't curse 1/4 turns. If there's others in the raid, I'll often wait to see their turn and see if they curse, then I'll attack. But that won't work if in on my own.

We need a RW for Johnny and Monahan, we need a solid D to partner Hamilton, and a genuine #1 goalie. Get them, trade out the dead weight and we should be right back in the playoff mix.

West Coast overachieved last year too, they just somehow kept on winning despite having injuries to all their key defenders. Other teams will have figured out their 'web' defense from last year so if they don't have something else planned, they are far from being a sure thing for top 8, let alone top 3. 
The thing going in their favour is they're bloody hard to beat at home. It's almost a guaranteed 8-9 wins. They go 5-5 outside of WA and they're in.

I'd more certain about Geelong. They simply can't go anywhere but up with Dangerfield. As much as I dislike Selwood, he hasn't played yet but add him to that midfield and they're lethal.

972,"Hey mate, great to see a keen follower from so far away.

Sounds like you're the opposite to me, I keenly follow the NHL but obviously AFL takes over this time of year, especially since my Flames are doing bugger all... And I get how you feel about always seeing the same teams on TV... We only get a few live games per week here and it's usually the popular teams like Detroit, LA, Chicago, etc. that seem to get more exposure.

Picking a top 8 is hard at the best of times, but especially this year. I've eliminated 6 teams from finals (the same as your predicted bottom 6), but I think the other 12 are a genuine chance. With that said:

- Hawks will be higher than 5th because they have great depth and synergy;
- Swans will be a lot lower than 2nd;
- I think you're right with the Bulldogs, they massively overachieved last year and this year will be a reality check (i.e. the Calgary Flames from 2014/15 to 2015/16);
- GWS *should* finish higher than 12.

I think finals positions more than ever will be influenced by injuries and percentage.

Go Flames Go!
