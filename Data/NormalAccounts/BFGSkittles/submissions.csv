John Longmire said in his press conference it needs to be looked at.
Brad Scott said as long as the rule is in place, players will try this tactic. He also questioned singling out players who do it and suggested every player in the competition does it.

What needs to be done here? 
I'm a massive advocate of NOT paying free kicks if the tackle goes high because the player being tackled makes it go high, whether it be ducking, shrugging the shoulders, or bending at the knees to induce high contact.

One day, someone is going to get hurt attempting this tactic, so I think it should be outlawed. Free kicks should be awarded against a player who does it. It they're repeat offenders like Thomas, then fines/suspensions should be considered.
