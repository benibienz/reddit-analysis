Im currently on the mentor with stoneforge as its good against any fair with a lot of disruption which is my current meta.

This is the killer part as it involves using a sorcery speed card called dread return (flashback reanimate, sacing 3 creatures) and getting your payload in the yard without hitting emrakul. Yes mathematically if you did it infinite times you would get all of them but its not a loop as you cant say that it will always happen. This is where the rules steps in, as a loop has to have at any point you able to say what the board state would look like and as you dont know where emmy is in your libary you cant say when you will hit that combo of the nessessary cards in your yard.

Mono black and black in general has fallen out of favor due to the meta game shift. UG has the speed and protection needed to win most games, unlike the mono black, it just doesnt have the pump or protection needed to cover it.

If you want a black deck then there are a few older BG decks around, this is a very different deck though in terms of its handling. Its more of a midrange resilance deck using the pro colours given by phyrexian crusader (the 2 biggest killers for infect, bolt/path) , backed up with pump spells and some protection with vines if needed. The main problem i see with it is that its just slower, and with the current meta you need the speed, even the slowest control decks (looking at you jeskai) has a fairly fast clock of nahari/emrakul, i think its best match up would be BW tokens and you have protection from their deck mostly and they dont have a quicker clock, but i would much rather be on UG.

• Return target permanent to its owner's hand.

Here is a simple check you can do:

1) pull a foil and some non foils shuffle them up and place them face down, try to find the foil if you can repeatably do this you have a problem.

2) put it on the top of your libary can you see that is a foil/is is noticably different to a non foil on the top

3) can you cut to a foil, with the bending this tends to be eaiser, check the card you cut to and the one thats still face down. if its repeatable you have a problem

Ways to get around any problems, try to a bend backwards/the other way to the foil, be very careful doing this. Then i would double sleeve the deck as this tends to hide foil bending a little. And repeat the steps above. Then i would check with a local/head judge before a fnm/torny.

For a full combo, look at the twin combo, it can generate an infinite amount of creatures.

Modern is a little different in the case that you know what meta decks there are, but i wouldnt be playing it if i didnt know the decks im playing against and how they work. This is due to know what to counter/remove. Is that creature important or can i just leave it alone, etc.

Back you deck though. Your main problem is going to dealing with combo decks and no permanent based decks. You dont really have any way to interact with cards on the stack, so storm will rekt you. Burn might be bad match up too as they can just point all the spells at the face. A lot of the cards you are looking at are far too slow, if you are playing control you really need to stablise by T3 as you are likely to be dead otherwise.

177,"This seems like a really dumb format, combo exist for a reason. Basically you are playing a game where you have an unremovalable [[mindlock orb]]. If you dont like tutors i would either build a deck around taxing tutors, such as mentioned mindlock orb, [[stranglehold]] etc. 

For the reasons you mentions i will counter point each one.

1) name what you are searching up and get it out at end of turn or pull it out, shuffle after your turn when your waiting. doesnt slow the game down then.

2) Not much, a fully built deck will have redunacy built in. Unless you are all in on one combo, which isnt a great idea most combo decks will have mutliple versions of the combo, see the kiki combo for example. you can use kiki/splinter twin + deciver/pestermite/zeleous/etc. Alternativly you can run multiple combos, i think i had a full sharum deck with around 30 different combos in the deck. so it wasnt hard for me to assemble on of them.

3) see above. And you really need answers, no seriouly if you dont have some form of interaction, removal spells/counterspeels then you really need to look at your deck building. Yes there is going to be some weird combo that you cant interact with but most can be solved with a removal spell. That is one thing i have found that newer players need to learn, put in answers, yes battle cruiser magic is fun but you need to deal with them.

4) Green really isnt the strongest. It good but you really need to pair it off to get the full effect, green ramp then into stupid stuff. But again there are answers. Easiest is stax, not for everyone, MLD again not for everyone. There really isnt much outside of these to punish going big other than mana barbs/etc. Alternative you can punish no basic greed with back to basic etc.

Scalding Tarn: Most likely a Grixis Control deck or a UR Prowess deck.

Polluted Delta: probably some kind of Grixis deck (Control/Delver), but could also be Esper Gifts/Control or UR Prowess.

Misty Rainforest: Could also be an Infect deck with a slow start or UR Prowess.

Flooded Strand: either Esper or Jeskai control. Watch out for Spell Snare and Path from both these decks

Arid Mesa: either Burn or some Jeskai variant. More likely to be burn though find out pretty fast with a T1 play usually. 

Wooded Foothills: Burn/Infect, you will know from a T1 play

Bloodstained Mire: probably Burn, but could also be Grixis or Jund

Windswept Heath: you often won't see this played and not cracked on turn 1, but if you do then you're likely playing against Abzan or Hatebears/Knightfall with a slow start

Marsh Flats: Abzan

Verdant Catacombs: Jund/Abzan.

Raging Ravine: Jund.

Treetop Village: Jund/Abzan

Gemstone Mine: Ad Nauseam or some other fast combo deck

Island: Doesn't give away much about the deck, but your opponent probably has Spell Snare. They could also be a Merfolk deck with a slow start

Mountain: most likely Burn

Snow-Covered Mountain: Skred Red. This deck isn't very popular but it does pop up from time to time. If you see this on turn 1, play around Blood Moon if possible.

Other basics are not likely to come down on turn 1 and not get tapped for something.

For a quick and dirty way to shut these to decks down:]

Krekno: Mass baordwipes hurt this deck hard, spot removal on the commander enough times, or just simply [[nevermore]] as krekno is usually all in on the krenko make tokens plan.

Aurelia: again just dont let them cast the commander counters work here or the good old nevermore, sounds like they are using a lot of artifact ramp to win by T5 so mas removal of them hits hard [[vandal blast]] [[shatterstorm]] [[shattering spree]]. Again spot removal works well here to to out cost the commander.

It sounds like this is a job for Stax though if you want to shut these decks down. I would start with a land lock down strat first then work on blowing up any remaining artifacts or a [[cyclonic rift]]. Some [[propaganda]] effects would be nice to stop the krenko deck too. I personally would go with a [[Derevi, Empyrial Tactician]] stax deck to beat both of these decks. It wont win by T5 but it will lock the game out by then.

212,"1) Pick a goal, a specific one. Not just ""I want to win by T5"". More ""I want to win by T5 by commander damage"" etc. This gives your deck a clear focus as to what it is and what its doing. For the sake im going write for a build of Kalemne voltron style.

2) Find cards. Use EDHREC, gather etc to find cards that go into the deck. This can take a while.

3) Make the cuts, now you this is where step 1 helps a lot and seeing where decks fail. If you go back to the example of having ""I want to win by t6"" this can be done via multiple routes, Inf mana + fireball, Massive token aggro etc. But this goal is via commander dmg. So im going down the voltron route. Equipment get in. Other combos get out. Look for cards that synergize with your goal, such as MLD with Kalemne, when i have her equiped, i could blow all the land to keep people off blockers etc.

4) Playtest/play the deck, you will find other people might have recommendation for the deck. You will most likely find cards that just seem bad and should be cut for others. Dont fall into the trap of a bad card being good, just because it won the game doesnt make it a good card. If that card was ----- you could have won the game x turns earlier. Rinse and repeat steps 2 - 4 until you are happy

[[Glistening Oil]] - see above

[[Tainted Strike]] - see above

[[grafted exoskeleton]] - I think your getting the idea

[[Fork]]/all the other duplicate spells - Why not do it again.

[[Curiosity]]/[[Helm of the Ghastlord]] - I heard drawing cards is a good idea.

[[Helm of the Ghastlord]] - Even better I draw cards and you dont. This will lock people out from drawing, they can only cast instants between the draw and the trigger. Really nasty.

[[Mizzix's Mastery]] - How many wheels can you do at once. Bonus it doenst care if it gets discarded. 

[[Waste Not]] - Get more value for that wheeling you are doing.

[[Hive Mind]] - Hum, how about everyone gets a copy of the wheel.

[[Dream Salvage]] - Draw all the cards

But just try it in a 4 man pod when you get the combo of [[Sakura-Tribe Scout]] &gt; [[Scryb Ranger]]. With 3 land in a 4 man pod you get to do double yisan tutor every turn cycle. This means you ramp up the counter to land a big fatty really early. An example of a typical game.

**T1** land &gt; Dork

**T2** land &gt; Yisan

**T3** land, pass activate yisan on end for Sakura-Tribe Scout

**T4** (land), activate yissan for Scryb Ranger, bounce a land to untap yisan, putting it back into play with the scout. Pass turn, bouncing a land &gt; untapping scout &gt; tapping scout to put bounced land back into play (a round about way to get untapped land on other peoples turn). Rinse and repeat untill you can active yissan again.

4 man pod is just before your turn, i usally grab elvish archdruid here for mana but what ever you want for 3. Wood Elves for ramp, Reclamation Sage to deal with a problem. Eternal Witness if they have killed something.

**T5** This is where it starts to get stupid, you can grab any 4 drop you want. and then untap yissan grabbing seedborn muse to go off. Profit.

1) a) *Player A, B, and C are playing a game of EDH. A plays their commander. B steals it and A's commander is now under B's control. If B hits C for 21 damage using A's commander, does C lose?*

Yes the commander damage is a link between the player (the one taking the dmg not the controller/owner) and the commander. Player C will die from lethal commander dmg.

1) b) *What if B hit A with his own commander?*

Yes you can lose via commander damage with your own commander damage, not really sure why you would let this but still it would suck. Killing your own commander feels bad.

1) c) *What if A had hit C prior to B stealing it?*

As explained in part a the commander damage will add to any previously done before.

1) Pick a goal, a specific one. Not just ""I want to win by T5"". More ""I want to win by T5 by commander damage"" etc. This gives your deck a clear focus as to what it is and what its doing. For the sake im going write for a build of Kalemne voltron style.

2) Find cards. Use EDHREC, gather etc to find cards that go into the deck. This can take a while.

3) Make the cuts, now you this is where step 1 helps a lot and seeing where decks fail. If you go back to the example of having ""I want to win by t6"" this can be done via multiple routes, Inf mana + fireball, Massive token aggro etc. But this goal is via commander dmg. So im going down the voltron route. Equipment get in. Other combos get out. Look for cards that synergize with your goal, such as MLD with Kalemne, when i have her equiped, i could blow all the land to keep people off blockers etc.

4) Playtest/play the deck, you will find other people might have recommendation for the deck. You will most likely find cards that just seem bad and should be cut for others. Dont fall into the trap of a bad card being good, just because it won the game doesnt make it a good card. If that card was ----- you could have won the game x turns earlier.

Personally i don't like either equipment, they cost too much to cast/equip for what they do.

Argentum Armor is a big effect for a big cost, paying 12 mana i would rather have 2 swords equipped for that. Also the effect is strong but look at it from the other side, makes you a massive target.

Darksteel plate is ok, but in my meta people have learnt to ignore indestructible, using exile effects etc, rather have hexproof/pro colours instead, indes is better when your commander doesnt come with first/double strike already as that usally stops her dieing to combat anyway where you would normall want it. If its to stop a board wipe i would much rather have [[sunforger]] (best card in the deck, really it is) +4 is massive, and it comes with a built in protection package or removal. Going back the boardwipe, i go get boros charm, quite a big blow out to save all my guys. Or is there is a real problem perminant that cant be solved by killing the player there is about 7 other cards i can fetch with it to deal with it. [[chaod warp]] etc. 

Im happy to talk about any cards that i have considered or put in, or budget options too.

Cards that you should run

Sword of x and y - if you have the money

[[sunforger]] - see above

[[Champion's Helm]] - +2/+2 and hexproof sign me up

[[Grafted Wargear]] - Free equips are great, and kind of needed in voltron to keep costs down

[[Hero's Blade]] - see above

[[Loxodon Warhammer]] - Life link and trample are nice

[[Tenza, Godo's Maul]] - really cheap card that give +3/+3 and trample, trample is really good for voltron, stops all the annoying chump blocks

[[Umezawa's Jitte]] - If you want to show off. But really there is a reason this card if banned in modern and is part of stoneblade. Also getting double counters is great (only gets 1 set if the creature dies to first strike). Its a swiss army knife, kills small stuff, buffs for leath or in a pinch gains you life if you are going to die (not likely if you have this on the table).

Also Tribal elf ball is kind of a flavor deck that is super strong, im sure there is a way to tie them all together as the deck is mostly elves. 

Nekusar story:

Let me tell you a story about a warloard, [[Nekusar, the Mindraze]], who ruled over his lands with an iron fist. He would be a generous ruler. Using his [[Howling Mine]] and [[Temple Bell]] to give everyone cards. He would only ask for the measly 1 life in return. This soon attracted other creatures to his land to help spread the joy and card draw. [[Kami of the Crescent Moon]] was one such creature. He soon acquired [[Venser's Journal]], which obviously went stright into his [[Library of Leng]]. With this new found richs he started to spread his Prosperity among the people.But soon his advisor, [[Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind]], said this was a bad idea and give people too much control. So soon he started to charge more for the privilege of having those cards. He started to get [[Spiteful Visions]] and [[Underworld Dreams]]. Because of this he soon turned his ruling into a [[Phyrexian Tyranny]]. This was around the time he got his little pet, a [[Psychosis Crawler]]. Soon everyone couldnt handle the taxes and start to leave, those that stayed soon perished under the painful rule of Nekusar.

346,"After a scan through it sounds like you have quite a mixed play group, mine is similar but we get around that problem by having multiple decks with different levels so we can have a similar game, I personally have 8 so it gives me options to play with and i know this isnt a solution for everyone. Instead of powering up your deck have you asked if the other would be willing to make another deck that isnt as powerful?

So my recommendations either find a deck like your tribal friend that you enjoy playing and dont care about winning. And as others have said EDH is about the journey, i enjoy seeing big plays being made and everyone else scrambling to answer it.

If that isnt an option another is to play counter control, which has been suggested and you said you dont want to play that, another way to play control is Stax this is usally in the form of resource denial stopping some of the more degenerate plays to be made. This is the way i have chosen to play mine. Mine is a tool box variant aimed at getting the right hate pieces tutored, and slowing everyone down with other effects. This can be played to be more hateful but i perfer a point where you can play just not do broken things. 

If you have any questions just reply to this and ill usally pick it up.

All legal commanders by colour. Not sure what you consider semi competitive but sub $80 is really low. I tend to start out with around $150 min and work from there. Athough i do have a large collection and plenty of edh staples to pick from.

Here is an old version of my krenko deck: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/13-09-14-krenko-mob-boss/ That if you take out the land and run basics comes a little over $100, and if you can pick up some of the goblins instead of buying them as people might even give you them you might be able to get it for the $80.

I found a full control deck in multiplayer isnt great as you dont tend to have enough counter spells to stop everything and then they tend to hate you anyway for countering their stuff, unless you are a political genius and can talk your way out of getting hit.

402,"The following is a good guide to working out what people are playing by turn 1.

&gt;PlatsonJiveMoney

&gt;To answer your first question, here are some assumptions you can pretty safely make about your opponent's deck based on what land they play (assuming they just play a land and pass on turn 1):

&gt;Scalding Tarn: most likely some Twin variant, watch out for Lightning Bolt and Spell Snare. Could also be a Grixis Control deck or a tricky Burn player.

&gt;Polluted Delta: probably some kind of Grixis deck (Twin/Control/Delver), but could also be Esper Gifts/Control or UR Twin.

&gt;Misty Rainforest: most likely a twin deck, either UR or TarmoTwin. Could also be an Infect deck with a slow start.

&gt;Flooded Strand: either Esper or Jeskai control. Watch out for Spell Snare and Path from both these decks

&gt;Arid Mesa: either Burn or some Jeskai variant. More likely to be burn though

&gt;Wooded Foothills: Burn

&gt;Bloodstained Mire: probably Burn, but could also be Grixis or Jund

&gt;Windswept Heath: you often won't see this played and not cracked on turn 1, but if you do then you're likely playing against Abzan or Hatebears/Knightfall with a slow start

&gt;Marsh Flats: Abzan

&gt;Verdant Catacombs: Jund/Abzan.

&gt;Raging Ravine: Jund.

&gt;Treetop Village: Jund/Abzan

&gt;Tolaria West: Amulet Bloom

&gt;Gemstone Mine: Amulet Bloom, Ad Nauseam or some other fast combo deck

&gt;Island: Doesn't give away much about the deck, but your opponent probably has Spell Snare. They could also be a Merfolk deck with a slow start

&gt;Mountain: most likely Burn

&gt;Snow-Covered Mountain: Skred Red. This deck isn't very popular but it does pop up from time to time. If you see this on turn 1, play around Blood Moon if possible.

&gt;Other basics are not likely to come down on turn 1 and not get tapped for something",2016-02-04 11:54:47+00:00,cznfo2j,2.0,t1_cznfnap,83.0,ModernMagic
403,"Modern is an interesting format to start magic. Knowing what decks people are on is down to practice, and really depends on meta. As at FNM levels you get a lot of brews turning up and being able to do well as you dont know that they are playing and how to play around it. This is far easier to call in standard due to the smaller pool, thus less viable decks.

Now to try to answer your questions.

Going to put 1, 2 and 3 together here.
[mtggoldfish](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/) is a good place to look at decks and whats popular currently. Top teir decks

**Tron** - Tries (and pretty much always) assembles the tron lands, [[urza's tower]] etc. using cards like [[Expedition Map]] and [[ancient stirrings]]. To power out big cards like [[Karn Liberated]] and big eldrazi.
Sideboard hate: Land destuction ([[Ghost quarter]]), and a clock.

**Affinity** - This dumps most of its hand turn 1, using cheap artifacts, 0 cost etc. Then uses [[Cranial Plating]] or [[arcbound ravager]] to pump the guys.
Sideboard hate: artifact destitution [[shatterstorm]], [[stoney silence]], [[kataki war's wage]] or board wipes [[pyroclasm]] 

**Abzan company** - This can be played a number of differnt ways. First the combo version, this assembles a combo bettween, a sac outlet usually [[viscera seer]], into [[Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit]] or [[Melira, Sylvok Outcast]], into [[kitchen finks]] or [[murderous redcap]] for infinite life or damage respectively.
The second is the value deck which just tries to beat you with good creatures such as [[siege rhino]], [[tarmogoyf]], [[lingering souls]]. 
Sideboard hate: Board wipes and cheap spot removal, [[dismember]] , [[path to exile]]

** B/x Eldrazi ** - This is a new deck, and hasnt settled into 1 list, so there are a lot of different versions out there, but they try to go a similar thing. Powering out the new eldrazi cheaply. Using [[eye of ugin]] or [[Eldrazi Temple]]
Sideboard hate: Board wipes, land hate.

**Infect** - This is a count to 10 deck. It kills you with a creature with infect, giving you poison counter which you only need 10 to lose the game. [[glistener elf]], [[blighted agent]] and [[inkmoth nexus]] are the big 3 creatures. then they pump them with spells untill you are dead. [[Become Immense]], [[mutagenic growth]]
Sideboard hate: spot removal, fast board wipe

**Burn** - Another counting deck this time to 20 with your life. Playing fast aggressive creatures, [[goblin guide]] , [[monastery swiftspear]]. In combination with direct burn spells [[lighting bolt]], [[atarka's command]]. Usally played in Naya colours, WRG, but can be Boros WR or just mono red.
Sideboard hate: [[leyline of sanctity]] , fast board wipe

**Zoo** - A very aggressive creature based deck, similar to burn but runs mostly creatures over the burn spells. Addtional creatures it runs are [[kird ape]], [[tarmogoyf]].
Sideboard hate: board wipe

**Delver** - This is a tempo deck, playing [[delver of secrets]] to apply a clock, then backing it up with counter magic, [[remand]]. Watch out for [[snapcaster mage]] to flash back their spells.
Sideboard hate: [[Boseiju, Who Shelters All]], [[Cavern of Souls]], more value cards.

**Elves** - This usually falls into 2 camps, with a side of mono green. All the decks follow the same strategy  though. Going wide, putting a lot of creatures onto the board and overwhelming any blocks. This deck can also generate an abserd amount of mana with [[elvish archdruid]]. GW is mainly green G1 splashing white for sideboard hate cards. GB splashes black for removal spells and a finisher in [[Shaman of the Pack]]
Sideboard hate: board wipes, spot removal for elvish archdruid

**Griselbrand** - My pet deck. A combo based deck revoling around cheating [[Grisselbrand]] into play, using [[Goryo's Vengeance]] or [[through the breach]] and drawing your deck with his ablity gaining life with [[nourishing shoal]] using [[worldspine wurm]]. Then putting [[Borborygmos Enraged]] into to chuck all the land at the opponent. It can also just beat you trough 20 life with [[worldspine wurm]]. Be careful with agasint this deck as it can win T1 with the absolute nuts, but can do T2/3 win with some regularity around 30-40%
Sideboard hate: Pithing needle, naming Grisselbrand or Borborygmos Enraged (careful naming Borborygmos Enraged and not Borborygmos as they are 2 cards with similar names :P), spot removal for grisselbrand, [[leyline of sanctity]], graveyard hate.

There are a few other decks that float around, storm, adnausum etc but im too lazy to write for them.

4)
Good and bad match ups are dependent on your deck and what deck you are playing against. Usually its a game of rock paper scissors, aggro beats control, control beats midrange, and mid range beats aggro. With combo being and outlier depending on how quick it is. Also with magic being a best of 3, sideboard play a lot in deciding match ups, your main deck might not be able to beat their deck, but you have access to 15 cards that could change the game. I would recommend looking primiers for each deck to find out what each deck is good against as its list dependent.

5) I depends on what you are playing against, if it was Twin(RIP) i would definatley say hold up the path, but any other deck it depends on the boardstate. Its down to practice to know when to play your treats to holding up removal.
Generally speaking it would say advance your boardstate unless, you think they might have a combo kill next turn that you need to disrupt or they have lethal to kill you.

Hope this helps.",2016-02-04 11:53:24+00:00,cznfnap,1.0,t3_444sme,3434.0,ModernMagic
404,"The sideboard seems fine, very much a meta call, hence why i keep mine open and will tweak mine dependent on where im taking it. As much as i like bloodmoon i personally think its a little over hyped. Most decks now have a way around it. The only deck that really doesnt currently is B/x exdrazi which if you are taking t3 off to cast this thing properly not a good situation anyway as they might have a clock onbaord anyway. Does get tron if you can get it early enough on the play. The only time i do like it is t1 but that does put you 3 cards down. SSG + desperate ritual, very hard to assemble.

I prefer IOK over duress and mostly thoughseize as 3 cmc is what you really care about in the deck if you are going down the reanimate grissel, and the 2 life can matter a lot. especially if you are having to shock to get the mana. 15 life is a massive risk. As that puts you to 1 with 2 draws.",2016-02-03 10:45:42+00:00,czm4i2p,5.0,t1_czl41s4,65584.0,ModernMagic
405,"Going on what wolfgangit said, burn match up sucks and there isnt a lot we can do about it, an early pyro is nice but you really need to mull to the combo preferably. Be careful how low you go if you do get the combo off, i take as many bolts as they have mana up etc, and only go into bolt range if i really need to.

Affinity is a little better as they give you an extra few turns as they dont have haste, so pyroclasm and shatterstorm can get you there.

I would recommend playing with the BR list for now, especially with the current meta of fairly aggressive decks. Learn that one as grisselshoal isnt the easiest decks to pilot nad going grixis makes it even harder. I have seen a lot of people fail playing the deck where they could have won doing different lines. You can go off endstep using the max hand size as a discard outlet :P, or reanimating on their turn etc. Try and find videos online and practice modern rewards the player that knows their deck the most.",2016-02-02 10:22:43+00:00,czkusz7,3.0,t1_czjtcwp,64683.0,ModernMagic
406,"I personally prefer the consistency of Grixis, and haven't found it much slower than the BR. It also does depend on your list exactly. This was all tested Pre ban and havent had much time to test/play after so take this with a pinch of salt.


I like the addition of Jace VP, i tend to relegate it to the sideboard though as it can be a massive tempo loss if its killed and can turn on bolts, but if its in your side they tend to side them out anyway. For what i have put in mainbaord are serum visions, another thing to do turn 1 as the only other option in BR is to faithless. Personally if you have both in hand T1 i tend to lead to serum if i dont have the combo already as it sets you up more for the draw on T2.

The second card that i added was izzet charm. Another loot card and in a pinch a soft counter.
For cards that i took out were, tormenting voice, nights whisper metamorphose.

One major downside to play grixis is the mana base is a lot more painful. So you may end up with less grisselbrand activations, and your burn matchup might be a little worse. But with the rise of the G/x eldrazi decks running even more hand disruption and a clock. I like having a little extra consistency.

Also looked into tasigurs scheming, im on the fence about it as it does dig through 5 cards and can find you both goyros and grisselbrand, but the problem comes when you hit a worldspine wurm as you reshuffle your deck where you may have scryed bad cards to the bottom. Also if you can run out of land if your not careful. As you bin just about every card that isnt goyros or breach, and i have had a game where i didnt have enough land in the deck to win with borborymos flinging land, had to beat face a few more turns to win.

Here is my list: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/grixishoalbrand/


TL:DR Added izzet charm, serum visons and jace in the board. + consistency, - painful manabase
