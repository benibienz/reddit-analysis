He was my first commander and im looking at rebuilding him, going through a lot of different iterations from the clone legion, to full combo to value. With the current one its value with a side of combo.

Current combos in the deck:

With Riku

Birthing Pod + 2 Drop - Pod up Deceiver Exarch copying with Riku, getting 2 triggers to untap Pod, with the second still on the stack, sac the token to get a 4 drop, then untap pod, sac the 4 drop getting Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker.

Palinchron - infinite mana

Worldgorger Dragon - Infiniate mana

Chord of Calling for 5, copied -&gt; Kiki combo

Other Combos:

Palinchron + Deadeye Navigator/Phantasmal Image

Chord of Calling for 6/9 - Chord woodland bellower -&gt; Eternal Witness -&gt; Chord all at end step, untap chord for 5 -&gt; Kiki -&gt; copies woodland -&gt; Bounding Krasis -&gt; infinite with kiki

Firemind's Foresight - Reiterate, Reset, Brainstorm -&gt; infinite mana and draw into comet storm. Cast reset holding priority, cast reiterate with buyback, to generate infinite mana, reiterate + brainstorm = draw. Either UUURR4 without riku or UUURR2 with riku.

I couldn't find it anywhere so i created my own and thought i would share. All the commanders by colour identity, which happens to be 600 legal ones. I have 27 on there are ether banned or are Non commanders (eg the Kamigawa flip card with only 1 the flipped side legendary).

Hopefully this will help you searching for a new general or get your brewing juices flowing. Please comment if i have missed anything or just got something wrong.

Edit: For those that are posting links to other sites, if you run a google search for ""commanders by colour"" etc they didn't come up on the first page so i assumed a list of this hadn't been compiled.

The sideboard are cards im looking at picking up for the deck and putting in. My current meta is quite varied as i play with a few different groups, but my main one we all have 2 - 4 decks with me and a friend having about 8 each, going from around 50% to full cut throat. Looking at putting her around 75% ish.
