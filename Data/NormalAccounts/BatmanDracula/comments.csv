Then when asked to move from the house he thought of his family in Atlanta, and had the means to get there.

Where would his family stay if he invited them? It is not practical. It makes more sense for him and his family of 2 others to go there doesnt it?

Remember extreme stress makes people do strange things. Say things without thinking. Gets their minds muddled. It doesn't indicate anything other than he just found his daughter dead. 

You seem to be stating facts which I cant find any supporting evidence for. This fake business meeting? Where was it proven to be fake. 

All I read was he had one, then cancelled it, then arranged to try and use the flight to fly to his family as he was told to leave. I don't see any of the other parts to this that has been confirmed. 

&gt;  How is in any way normal to want to leave the state when your daughter has been missing for only hours? 


Nothing is normal in that circumstance, who knows what you or anyone else would react in that circumstance.

He explains in the most  understandable way. He was aked to leave. Thought of getting his family to his family. Doesn't mean he was not thinking for coming back in a day. They needed support, he had another kid, he wanted his wife and kid to be with his family. Actually it is probably what I would have done. 

Got my family to my family and once I knew they were safe come back to the investigation and help if I could.

I use the word crazies in all honesty - These downvotes are largely due to them. And not the first time.

I think I know quite a bit about the case, and everytime I ask for these absolutes that people suggest I calmly explain them away like many people have. 

Watch the BBC documentary, it is pretty decent at explaining a lot of things.

As for ignorant bully. Lets be fair. I didn't bully anyone. I have a decent grasp of the facts, and more importantly, and this needs to be registered, I think I have a very much neutral view of the case that most people on here don't. I have asked for more information and responded to all I can find.

I think 90% on here have made up their minds already. That's my great strength.

And as I said, every time I ask for this knock out evidence I can easily explain it as something else. But none of you can explain away the outside DNA. Or accept the FBI and the DAs reports. 

Why can't anyone of these believers accept this DNA evidence for what it is, from far more knowledgable people than yourselves? They go and grab one or two people who have a theory as to how and why it got there and dismiss the general consensus from the law that yes in fact it is outside DNA which they admitted aquits the family?

128,"&gt; Well in most of these cases involving children, someone in the family was involved.

Absolutely true. 

 &gt; Don't call everyone else dumb for believing someone in the Ramsey family was involved.

Except there is no concrete evidence for it, just innuendo and heresay, and much that leans to an outside presence.

Strange behaviour is quite common from people dealing with such things. 

&gt;  It's not exactly logical to believe that someone from a foreign crime syndicate came into the home, used stuff that was laying around the murder Jon Benet, and then left a ransom note (not necessarily in that order). It's just outlandish.

Yes it might be but I never mentioned crime syndicates, I think it is just one very fucked up individual, who prob knew the family in some way. That is not outlandish.


&gt; Not to mention that the unusual ransom letter demanded ransom in the amount of Mr. Burke's Christmas bonus (which means it must be someone close to him, or it's an incredible coincidence). Not to mention, as I said, all the weapons and stationary were from inside the home.

The letter is a strange piece of evidence. I absolutely agree. I think it leans to what I was thinking though, a very deranged person who took great pleasure in writing it. 

Absolutely think it was someone who knew them in some capacity. Whether from going through their garbage to squatting when they were out of town to being a family friend or co-worker, and I doubt it was a sudden thing, it was long gestating.

All I heard was the police officer said she lost track of him for about an hour. Proof of nothing. At all.

Oh I read it there, thank you, again it just backs up what I am thinking. He called to cancel. THen after the immense shock of what happened and being asked to leave he automatically thought of atlanta, where his family was, and the pilot came back into his head

Once again, there is nothing particularly suspicious about this. In a moment of extreme stress he thought of being with his family, and had the means and contact to do so, spur of the minute impulsive reaction

In fact if he was guilty like so many others I'd say he would have insisted on hanging around and finding out what he could

Don't get upset over the use of the word *'crazies'*, this is from much past experience dealing with people about this case. Massive onslaughting of downvotes and rude insulting PMs. Possibly the wrong term but one that equates with my history. I apologise if people got upset about that.

(a) There was no physical evidence linking the Ramseys to the homicide, and physical evidence found near JonBenét's body suggested the presence of an unknown person in the home.


(b) There was no plausible motive for the Ramseys to kill their daughter. Douglas regarded the bed-wetting hypothesis as so unprecedented as to verge on absurdity. Furthermore, it was inconsistent with Patsy's established behavior.


(c) There was no evidence of physical abuse, neglect, sexual molestation, or serious personality disorders in the Ramsey household prior to the murder. Some combination of these is associated with most cases of children killed by their parents.

Most people are going to have to go below BMR to get a significant deficit. Just don't go below 1200 (men) or 1000 (women), which are the NIH's safe loss cutoffs.

Speaking with Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, Eastwood discussed the stunt in which he dangled from a mountain on the end of a cable:
I didn't want to use a stunt man, because I wanted to use a telephoto lens and zoom in slowly all the way to my face—so you could see it was really me. I put on a little disguise and slipped into a sneak preview of the film to see how people liked it. When I was hanging up there in the air, the woman in front of me said to her friend, 'Gee, I wonder how they did that?' and her friend said, 'Special effects.'[16]

&gt; However, many old photographs show that pasties were wrapped in bags made of paper or muslin and were eaten from end-to-end;[18] according to the earliest Cornish recipe book, published in 1929, this is ""the true Cornish way"" to eat a pasty.
