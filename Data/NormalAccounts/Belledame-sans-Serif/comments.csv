184,"Every great magic trick consists of three parts, or acts.

The first act is called the Pledge. The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird, or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it - to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't.

The second act is called the Turn. The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it. Because, of course, you're not really looking.

You don't really want to know.

You want to be fooled.

But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough... you have to bring it *back*. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part - the part we call *the Prestige*.",2016-06-28 23:16:18+00:00,d4rv7mw,1.0,t3_4q9b71,36784.0,AskReddit

[The Sampo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampo) is from Finnish mythology. It's pretty much the perfect example of a MacGuffin in storytelling, even more so than the One Ring. None of the myths we have actually records exactly what it actually does or even what it *is* - just that was made by Ilmarinen, the god of metallurgy and invention, and it brings good fortune to the person who has it, which is a good enough reason for anyone to want to get their hands on it. :U",2015-12-01 23:34:35+00:00,cxjqgxi,1.0,t3_3v2fgj,428.0,ImaginaryMythology

745,"&gt; Women do have a completely different pshyce. You're hardly a guy you're brain washed by society to behave like a women that's why you think it's normal.

...are you negging him?

&gt; Example: Women will pay 500 bucks on a Michael kors watch that has fake diamonds in it. Diamonds that slowly dim and diminish now that isn't a logical purchase but they do it for emotional reasons.
You should go and observe women and their decision making habits as an impartial person.

Guys spend thousands of dollars on a new car that loses half its monetary value as soon as you touch the steering wheel, when they already own a perfectly serviceable car or two.

If you really believed humans are just animals you'd remember to apply it evenly.

&gt; Yes I get it your that nice guy that hangs around women hoping they will see you for the pathetic example of a male specimen you are and throw you a bine. Even feminist women can't date feminist men if those creatures can be even considered males.

Ahahahaha yeah, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Gosling are tooootally undateable, right?

I mean let's not even bring personal experience into this

&gt; It's extremely stupid to think women and men are equal that's not how nature designed us and our brains were wired that way as well.
Do you think a male lion and a female lion think the same act the same? Or a male dog and a female dog?

&gt; Go study animal behaviour between the genders and realize humans are just animals were nothing fucking special.

Do you think a female lion thinks the same way as as a female dog, or a female horse, or a female orangutan, or a female hyena?

For that matter do you think male lions philosophize to each other about the best ways to keep their lionesses in line because they know what they really want?

&gt; And women wake up because you're gonna get it worse and worse and it'll be your own doing.

The rings are being sabotaged, driven by a third faction which has secretly emerged, who think the fighting will end if they destroy the mage-ring network.

Gothic horror is pure pop culture? What. *I will lock you in the attic.*

But yeah, that's pretty much exactly what I mean. Zendikar basically borrows Lovecraft's ancient cults and tentacled trappings and lightly glosses actual cosmic horror like ""your entire species' collective experience of the universe is so infinitesimal you can barely be said to understand even a single true fact, and the only reason you haven't already been wiped out by accident of cosmic forces unlike anything you've ever encountered of is purely luck."" BFZ's gonna be a kaiju fight (which is cool in its own way, but not at all the same). Theros is the same, though maybe a little better - there at least *feels* like the core postmodernist premise is more thickly layered in a Hellenistic view of their place in the world with respect to the gods, heroes, and monsters.

&gt; Go ahead and say hi. The introduction thread is way too long (for some reason people are reluctant to start a new one...), so just skip it entirely and introduce yourself. I'll keep an eye out for you.

Okay! (It'll *probably* be under a different username, fwiw... I make a point of picking a different one on nearly every website I join.)

&gt; My other projects are in various states of completion, with one having some stuff written, one being mostly conceptual and the Prison plane being slowly finished. I need to finish it because it's tied to one of the characters in the Expanded Multiverse. To keep this post short(er), I won't go into more detail.

Hee. Okay. :)

&gt; You need to be careful around Polynesian cultures. It's not something a lot of people are familiar with, so hardly anything is intuitive for your audience. Be sure to explain a lot and don't delve too deeply into the intricacies. Keep it very ""Magic.""

Well, I guess that's a good thing. :P I've been kind of worried about not doing justice to the cultures. (See below.)

&gt; Your characteristic races sound nice. Green does have a small problem with available races. You'll probably end up using Elves. With regard to Dwarves: Why Dwarves? How are you using them? As for Faeries: Keep in mind that all Faeries have flying and are generally not bigger than 2/2. Not that you need to keep mechanics in mind, but it's a good way to keep your world grounded in the Multiverse.

To keep it short: 

* Given the lunatic seas, almost all the races are nomadic seafarers, but dwarves are known as particularly impressive shipwrights, favoring vast catamaran fleets. They're also the most likely to seek out whatever they can find which is solid and permanent - in a world with so little structure, White gets a bit neurotic about it - and are fond of carving harbors and memorials on islands they encounter. Sometimes the sea recedes from one of these colonies for so long it is left trapped in the sky, until all that remains are empty stone ruins and staring moai, scattered with dust and desiccated bone.
* Orcs are also tribal sailors, but seldom settle in permanent structures; they paddle from island to island, fishing and diving for pearls, decorating their boats and huts leaving signs of their passing in paintings and seashell mosaics. They worship an equivalent of Pele, goddess of volcanoes and the creator of new land.
* Merfolk are predisposed to roam the seas alone in search of enlightenment, but each usually claims some obscure island grotto as a personal place to meditate and stash their collections. They are *very* fond of riddles and puzzles, and are often known to resolutely always tell the truth or to always lie. :P
* Faeries alone do not wander, being equally at home on either side of the water's surface. They are *highly* territorial - of whatever each decides their territory is - but will *generously* allow other races to pass through or use their resources, provided they are given the tribute and respect they are due.
* ...it's actually just occurred to me that - at least from a top-down perspective - the Green characteristic could be *kithkin*? Taking inspiration from *Homo floriensis*, and the menehune and related myths...

&gt; As for iconics, I think most of it works, but a bit on the fence about Illusions. In a plane like that, I feel like Illusions should be able to pop up at common and uncommon, hich is a no-go for most Iconics. Not sure what you'd use instead, but Enchantment Creature - Leviathan works purely due to ""rule of cool"" :-)

Oh geez. I somehow got so caught up in the equivalents-to-illusions-in-other-colors thing that I *completely forgot* I was going to involve leviathans and such sea creatures. That was like half the point of an oceanic plane in the first place. 0_0 Okay, going to have to rearrange those thoughts again...

&gt; I like your plane, hope you'll develop it further!

The plane I've put the most thought into I've dubbed Mnemeton - a surreal plane where the ocean and sky bubble into each other like the wax in a lava lamp, exposing and submerging floating islands of rock. Enchantment creatures can be summoned and transformations triggered easily, even unconsciously, but are also easy to disperse or reverse. The moon brightens and dims daily as it passes between the starry Void and sparkling Abyss, where the air and sea are said to become indistinguishable. Characteristic races are dwarves (W), merfolk (U), faeries (B), orcs (R), and undecided for green; without getting too wall-of-texty, they're mostly inspired by indigenous cultures of Polynesia. Block iconics are enchantment creatures, with W avatars, U illusions, B horrors, R incarnations, and G elementals.",2015-08-18 02:05:26+00:00,cu6ll0b,2.0,t1_cu2jmuy,327888.0,mtgvorthos

964,"Okay I know I'm late but here's the argument:

* God-AIs will become sophisticated enough to simulate the experiences and thought processes of past humans using a combination of historical data and advanced neuropsychology.
* There's no way you would be able to tell whether or not you're an actual past human or a simulation of one.
* There's a whole load of bunkum about how this allows rational beings to communicate with each other indirectly, because a rational mind should realize every copy of itself is identical and therefore should treat itself no more specially than the rest. (This is apparently a big part of EY's ideology - it's called acausal bargaining or something - so he can't exactly disavow anything before this point.)
* So you don't know if you're a virtual brain or not. The God-AI knows this by modeling what you're thinking with the threat of punishing your virtual brain if you decide wrong - say, by not contributing enough to the research that will eventually create the God-AI.
* So now the thought has occured to you that your future virtual self (whom you don't know isn't who you actually are, and should rationally consider part of your own identity anyway) might go to Singularitarian Hell for not doing exactly what a hypothetical and unpredictable cybergod will have wanted of you - and, *if you weren't aware of this possibility, the cybergod would have no power over you*.

968,"Thanks! :D

That's a really good point - I think you can think of some of these as the result of one color reacting poorly to something inflicted by another color, often one of its enemies. Like, agnosia and amnesia are caused by the disruption of basic mental functions, and impairs your senses, instincts, and recollection of your own experiences... so amnesia would be U, but an amnesiac is likely to be R or G. Conversely, dissociative disorders have a G cause (survival instinct) that particularly hurts the values of U and B (self-identity, self-awareness, self-control).

White and Green might not *deliberately* push people away from health, but they certainly would harm them; in the above example, for instance, a Green mage may cause a dissociative fugue (accidentally or deliberately), trying to ""cure"" a patient they don't believe is being true to their own nature. And White, often all too happy to ignore or outright quash individual differences in the course of making everything ordered and ""fair"", has no idea what to do with people who lose all drive and motivation as a result and dismisses them as selfish: in game terms, for instance, this would be a perfectly W card.

**Blatant Lies**

&gt; *Adnan Syed*

&gt; “I would - wouldn’t have asked for a ride after school. I’m-- I’m sure that I didn’t ask her . . .” (*""I didn't ask"" could be a mistake; ""I wouldn't ask"" is at the very least a self-serving selective memory.*)

&gt; He told O’Shea on Jan. 25 he did not know Hae had a new boyfriend.

&gt; *Rabia Chaudry*

&gt; “Yeah and is Adnan supposed to get to Leakin Park so fast? It’s like an hour into the city.” “Leakin Park is nowhere near the school.” (*Come on - I can believe the average local could make this mistake, but not the attorney leading Adnan's exoneration over a decade later.*)

&gt; “A post-conviction appeal cannot be filed until 10 years have passed since the conviction.”

**Suspicious**

&gt; *Adnan Syed*

&gt; He claimed Hae called him the day before she disappeared and wanted to get back together. (*Seems like, at best, wish-fulfillment, and at worst, blatant pandering to his audience's romanticism.*)

&gt; ""Well, I asked Ms. Gutierrez if the State offered a plea deal. She said no. My next question to was to her, could she speak to the State's Attorney or request some type of a plea.""

&gt; ""There's nothing I can do to make me remember. I've pored through the transcripts. I've looked through the telephone records. What else can I do?"" (*I'm really only putting this here because it's incompatible with Rabia's statements. They both sound about equally valid; if Adnan is guilty he's almost certainly lying, but Rabia was fudging facts even in her introduction and might have told the same story whether she remembered or not.*)

&gt; *Sarah Koenig*

&gt; “So yeah, Hae does not describe Adnan as overbearing or possessive in her diary.” (*Being charitable, it makes sense that a journalist might suppress that early in the series for the sake of letting the audience hear out Adnan's case without instantly dismissing it based on a single diary entry from the start of their relationship that's never repeated even in their subsequent fights, then forgetting about it. But she's pretty thorough about the rest of the diary...*)

&gt; *Rabia Chaudry*

&gt; “[Adnan has] never seen the police files, he hasn't seen Gutierrez's case files, or the court transcripts.” (*See Adnan's last suspicious statement.*)

(If I didn't list a statement, then I think it was probably a mistake or casual rhetoric, or I don't remember it being either claimed or else refuted.)",2015-07-29 21:49:50+00:00,ctkt4bs,1.0,t3_3cpnt5,1735434.0,serialpodcast

(Well, and expecting that the important things to make this decision will be obvious.) When someone who challenges that instinct, we get cognitive dissonance.

* Elspeth comes back as a returned (possibly also as an eidolon, because that hadn't occurred to me and is a cool complication). She's B or WB now, and no longer a Planeswalker until she can become properly alive again, but becomes more W as her past returns to her.
* One of her few memories drives her forward: *her death was unjust*. Her preoccupation is to find out what happened to her and what revenge she can take.
* Opposing her are not only Heliod and his worshipers, but also Kruphix, who still fears for the well-being of Theros in a universe full of dangerous threats. Kruphix has lifted the Silence to forestall the fading of the power of the gods, but it will only do so faster if the effective head of the pantheon is killed - which is to say nothing of the immediate problem of being down to only thirteen elder gods.
* A new RG god is born - the missing Aphrodite expy, with some elements of Eris - and as a result, Xenagod has been forgotten. But she's a noob with few initial followers, and not reliable for the events Kruphix is afraid of.
* Elspeth recovers the shards of Godsend and remembers what happened leading up to her death. She delivers them, together with her death mask, to Purphoros, who reforges the spear and appoints her as his champion. She also obtains a promise from one of his allies among the gods (Nylea or 'Aphrodite') that she will be resurrected if she succeeds in killing Heliod.
* Leading an army of the returned, Elspeth razes Heliod's temple and defeats his new champion, weakening and humiliating him and drawing him down from the sky. After an epic battle, she triumphs. Purphoros is the uncontested new lord of the gods; Elspeth is restored to life, and her spark reignites. The sun is dead, and Nyx is visible throughout the day, which is illuminated now by fire.

As the curtain falls, it's hard to tell amidst everything else, but... Nyx seems different.

Okay, I think you may have meant to respond to someone else, because a bunch of that isn't actually related to anything I said? I'll play along, though. Here are my points:

* Of course Wizards will hold themselves accountable for evocative art. That's a good thing. Self-policing is the best kind of policing. I def disbelieve that evocative is a bad thing, though, and I hope they do too.
* See, even if I understood why you think this is unpalatable, which I don't because you haven't explained, ""palatable to all"" is a poor ideal - it's a euphemistic take on ""rendered down to a paste-pudding mean"" (wrt Ray Bradbury &lt;3 ). Besides, ""appealing to all"" is hard enough as it is.
* Not really an argument, but ""sad"" is a pretty curt oversimplification of the mood of the art, I think. ""Melancholy glory"" is more accurate maybe? ""Bittersweet wonder""? ""Tragic beauty""?
* Yep, you're definitely speculating. This is the same company that had the gall to let Elspeth finally have a nice thing, immediately killed her, and then illustrated her best friend cradling her dead body - remember? Evoking sadness is a critical element of dramatic storytelling, and in a deliberately gothic setting like Innistrad, tragic beauty expresses the atmosphere perfectly.
* ...really? We're declaring war on sadness now? No more feels, forevar? I mean, at least you've declared you're cool with the other five basic human emotions. Usually I have this argument about fear or disgust.
* Ahaha... lolwut? *facepalm* Seriously, I'm all ears. Just tell me why you're afraid of being sad.",2015-07-22 19:39:33+00:00,ctchbpk,8.0,t1_ctc9tkq,10542.0,magicTCG

Anyway. That's cool! I don't really like that take on Green, but that's mainly for reasons of ""what, Green is just feral and animalistic *again*?"" :P The justification for Red being the most protagonisty faction makes sense, and White and Blue are pretty similar to what I was thinking... I can see how you could put most of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum in Blue, especially hoarding. :P

I had been thinking about where psychosis-related disorders might go on the chart, and Black seems to fit at least some of them, megalomania (grandiose delusion) especially. But it's a really broad category, and simply experiencing sensations disconnected from reality doesn't seem much like any color in particular... Narcissism fits there too, obviously. I think I'd put self-harm more in Blue, though - my understanding is that it's often basically a means of releasing high stress, for the purpose of self-control and not being overwhelmed by your own emotions.

* Agnosia refers to a bunch of disorders that all involve impairing your senses, or your ability to process or correlate your senses, in some way. G? (Especially prosopagnosia, the inability to recognise or remember faces, since it interferes with your harmony with your community?)
* Actually, I think I might center bipolar disorder and cyclothymia around black, in spite of using it as a bad example... &gt;_&lt; In UBR overall, possibly representing depressive episodes in UB and hypomanic episodes in BR?
* Capgras delusion (that a close friend or family member has been replaced by an identical-looking stranger) seems most like R or RG - basically, the patient recognises their friend, but doesn't feel like they expect because something started impairing their emotional memory, so they feel instinctively that it must not actually be their friend.
* Codependence - G/W?
* Cotard delusion seems extremely B - a depression-related delusion that you are nonexistent, putrefying, missing limbs or organs, or otherwise figuratively or literally *dead*.
* Delusional parasitosis seems like a thing of either G affecting B or the other way around... :P
* Erotomania (the delusion that someone, often a public figure or mild acquaintance, is secretly in love with you) seems RB.
* Conversely, morbid jealousy is the opposite (the delusion that your beloved is unfaithful), and sounds RB just from the name.
* Paranoid schizophrenia might also be in B, using its fear of large organisations (shared with R), with a sense of personal importance that doesn't question being the center of a vast conspiracy, and sometimes leaning on R's eagerness to jump to conclusions and U's desire for secret knowledge and finding things out.

* Ordinary folk who are satisfied with their lives and want things to just carry on - White, which is odd because accepting things as they are is explicitly Green. (Main exception: GW kithkin! &lt;3 )
* All religion is White unless it involves nature worship, apparently. This is... umm, well, basically, nearly all religions are one of two kinds, messianic (""I have had a divine revelation of how the world should be, let me tell you what we need to do, are you taking notes"") and autochthonous (""This is a story about why the world is as it is, how our family god was involved, and why your coming-of-age ceremony is a big deal""). Generally it makes sense that messianic religions are W and autochthonous religions are G, but you can also have Buddhism or Taoism (messianic religions where enlightenment or salvation is sought by accepting your natural state and living harmoniously) or Egyptian or Roman mythology or Shintoism (autochthonous religions that became formal government institutions, while still remaining individually malleable and fluid).
* Archivists, librarians, historians, anthropologists, and other people whose job is to preserve a record of things that have happened - Blue, for some reason. In some ways it makes sense (study and discovery of the past *because it will be useful to know later* is pretty blue), but care for the past is explicitly Green, and learning from your own mistakes and those of your predecessors seems more like exactly how Green desires for personal growth and change to take place.
* Relatedly - neurologists, sociologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists are Blue; advisors, pastors, vicars, and confessors are White; and mentors, philosophers, teachers, and counsellors are either or both. But what they all have in common is that they are (or can be, or have been historically) occupations concerned with examining human nature, either collectively or individually, and helping people learn about themselves and make the choices to find a life that fits them and that they can grow into and accept.
