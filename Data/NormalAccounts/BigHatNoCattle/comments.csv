4,"Here's the thing, all jokes aside, if you apply the ""competency ladder"", you are at the consciously incompetent stage... You consciously know you don't know shit about riding. 

This is a step up from when you signed up for the MSF class. That's when you were unconsciously incompetent, or you had no idea of all the shit you didn't know about riding. 

With practice, you'll move to consciously competent. You'll need to think about everything and you'll get the job done. This is the goal of the MSF class, but it can still be overwhelming for new riders. 

Again, with more practice, specific skills will move to unconscious competence freeing up your mind to focus on riding instead of the minutia it takes to ride. You won't have to think about how to shift or how much brake to apply or how to feather the clutch for a smooth take off. You'll just think ""shift"" or ""down shift"" or whatever and you'll make it happen. This is also the time cockiness enters the equation resulting in butt pucker moments.

Look for 10% increase on front and 20% rear when hot. Much more and you're cooking the tire; much less and you aren't getting full heat so ride a little harder or remove some air.

I'm assuming you will not take the bike to a shop as it's going to cost more than the bike itself. You'll want to find a bad runner because of a dirty carburetor/bad fuel gets you closer to a 1k bike. You tube shitty carbs and check them out in person for a match. 

I don't think a bike needs to run to pass a safety inspection for registration, but tires are a deal breaker. Know what that cost is. And the cost includes whatever it takes to pull both wheels off safely plus $50 to mount new rubber. 

Minimum price for a running, street legal bike should be around 1500, so don't be afraid to communicate that expectation to the seller and ding it for everything it falls short on. Don't ever refer to it as their bike, only the bike. 

Look at 2k bikes. You can tell by the ad which owners are selling a 2k bike and which are owners are asking 2k for their bike. You're about to ride motorcycles and it takes balls to do it, so start showing them now. If the seller is a pussy, don't waste your time.

For parking lot practice, go to 2nd hand sports Store and get a bunch of tennis balls and cut them in half. You now have cones. Set up a large figure 8, where the corner is 3-4 spaces wide. Practice body position and transfer and throttle control. Be smooth! Focus your vision into the next turn. When you get that down, you can monkey with trail braking and release. Increase speed by increments or 2-3 mph so it's less stressful on your brain and keep your vision up and looking into what's next, not what's now.

The key is heat cycles, load, and varied rpm and engine brake between redline and lug. After that, it's pretty much set. Also, optimal break in can mildly increase hp, but on a 100+ hp engine, we're talking about 2-3%, so don't sweat it. 

Couple suggestions 

1. Make sure they didn't already put the warranty in service. 

2. Have them replace the battery and brake fluid. My battery was dead on day 2 during my 2nd ride after I stopped for a smoke. Pop started easy enough.

Anyway, if by saggy front end you mean you're hitting the end of the range of your suspension a lot, you need more preload or stiffer springs. If it oscillates after a bump or takes too long to stabilize, it's oil. 

If you can't tune in the oil, you're riding style doesn't match your bike. Look for your fork diameter for fit, then figure out if another bike's better tech will change the rake. Or trail? Idk. ",2016-05-10 23:56:25+00:00,d30ncax,1.0,t3_4irx2f,4021.0,motorcycles

With the CA model, if you remove the PAIR system, you have to vent the tank by putting a fuel line off one of the tube at the front of the tank. That's what the duct tape thing looks like. Remove the tank to confirm. 

Storage - kriega system rocks. I only have the us20 bag, but it's modular, so I can add on.

I usually get a coolant leak there after valve adjustment because the oring for the coolant pipe, which goes in right next to spark well, is fried.

2. Remove the PAIR system and cap it to simplify air flow. That crap may be clogged and is stupid anyway.

4. Air filter. K&amp;N Is a good update with less restriction; just make sure it's clean.

1033,"New makes a huge difference; I'm assuming used.  Also, if money is an issue (as in, can't manage it), one should not be looking to buy an expensive toy.

Regarding financing, yeah, it's stupid to finance 15k for that sweet Ducati Scrambler and gear if you're a new rider.  I'd assume it's going to be totaled before payoff, but a 2k loan?  It doesn't cost much to carry that and the riding time, for me, is way more valuable than the $75 in finance fees (7% for 12 months).  I also select bikes that have already gone through depreciation so they don't compound the acquisition costs.

Like your example, the R3 is a great looking bike. It was probably around 5.5k OTD, but if you sell it this year, you can expect about 4k, netting your acquisition/use cost around 1.5k + change for financing.  That goes up every year until it's a 2k bike.  In my mind, I can get that 2k bike, ride it like it's stolen and sell it for about the same purchase price, minimizing the overall acquisition/use costs.  Of course, my bike will never be as sexy as a new R3, so there's that.",2016-01-13 17:17:10+00:00,cywsu3n,5.0,t1_cywpyul,4051.0,motorcycles
