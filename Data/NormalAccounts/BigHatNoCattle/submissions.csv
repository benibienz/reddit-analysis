I've been riding my speed triple for a couple months now and she just doesn't get the same gas mileage as others reported on fuelly. Fuelly posts an average near 40mpg, but I can't even get 30mpg.

Bike is stock minus farkles. I got it with 26 miles, put on 3700. Seems like the best mileage is out of town  highway rides, but I mostly commute/stay in town.

Previous post, I was asking about taking multiple bikes. I decided to go with my s3r on new diablo rosso 3's instead of my ex500 and focused on the pointers you guys offered. Amazing experience. Well run and here's what I learned for a first timer:

* be patient and use morning sessions to learn the line, regardless of the idiots riding out of their shoes. I got aggressive in session 4/7 and almost wiped twice with front lockups. By the end of that session, 3 wrecks happened at turn 12 due to fists full of brake. 
* Slow it down after missing markers or you're only going to make it worse for the next turn. 
* the pit ride through is a great way to find a gap in the train and regain focus. I did it at least twice during the day. 
* the light bulb didn't go off for me until class after session 4. My understanding of outside pass was wrong, and after already investing in practicing the line all morning, I was consistently passing folks coming out of 10, 12, 15, 18, and 19. Holy shit is that fun. 
* 1st ever knee drag at turn 20. Scared the shit out of me enough to stand it up and hit the candy stripe for a second helping.  
* turns 1, 7 and 13 are a sonofabitch. I think I got them close to right about 1/3 of the time.
* humble brag : I did COTA. ",Trackdays,Follow up to my first ever track day: COTA,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trackdays/comments/4zxidt/follow_up_to_my_first_ever_track_day_cota/
