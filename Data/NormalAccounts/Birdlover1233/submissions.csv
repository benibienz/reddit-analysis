Today this all seem to be gone, most of my friends have mellowed out and turned to more tradionational political philosophies, a lot of them even renounced libertarianism and turned to leftist or conservative ideologies, most of the libertarian groups in my region have disbanded and those who are exist consist of the same old people with no new blood coming in, this board has considerably slowed down both in quality and quantity of the discussion and seem to have bee coopted by various other ideologies, nobody seem to be working on libertarian projects, the FSP has turned out to be a failure, bitcoin never reached its former glory again and becomes centralized every day a little bit more, there are no new great thinkers or leaders, no fresh ideas, nothing on the horizon that would indicate that libertarianism is anything but a hopeful dream of a few crazy guys. 

I really lost any hope that libertarian policies will gain any traction in the near future, states are taking away more freedom every day, surveillance becomes  all-encompassing every day a little bit more, taxes are on the rise and the tax authority are coming down harder on every one trying to escape.

I recently read this study that hte legalisation of prostitution does [not lead to an decrease in human trafficking but as a matter of fact to an increase](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X12001453) and that made me wondering. Human trafficking would obviously exist in AnCapistan too but in the absence of a central police force who would help them? The victims of an human trafficking can not subscribe to any DRO. Does this means they are not covered by any law and thus are free to be done with whatever one pleases? Polycentric law turns law into a good to be bought, so what about people who can not afford it? Do they have to hope for a charitably soul to cover their fee otherwise they are basically outlaws? ",Anarcho_Capitalism,How would human trafficking be dealt in AnCapistan?

Researchers ""estimate that free-ranging domestic cats kill 1.4–3.7 billion birds and 6.9–20.7 billion mammals annually. This study calls cats the [worst invasive species](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n1/full/ncomms2380.html) in the USA. Thus I believe cats should only be allowed indoors and should treated as pest (like pigeons or rats) if found outside. I am a Bird lover and I can witness the damage done by cats every day. As such I should be allowed to destroy any cat coming at my property. CMV please.
