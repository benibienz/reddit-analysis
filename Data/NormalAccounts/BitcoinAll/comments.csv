  &gt;Based on the license agreement of Windows, Microsoft can pretty much do anything to the OS installed on your computer.

&gt;So what's stopping them from creating their own distributed blockchain across all Windows computers, and using all that power for mining purposes?

&gt;Apparently 14+ million people are already using Windows 10, and lots more using older versions of Windows.  So that's a lot of processing power.  All Microsoft has to do is release an update which gets installed on peoples computers, and starts mining away when the cpu is idle for example.

&gt;I don't think the bitcoin network even with asic hardware could compete...",2015-09-22 14:08:15+00:00,cva68mt,1,t3_3lxrjy,4,BitcoinAll

&gt;I just want to add that the Australian Bankers Association made some claims that its because of lack of AML/KYC. 

&gt;Yet companies like Coinjar had accounts closed even with KYC.

&gt;I actually halted trading on my Westpac account, and said to somebody from the security department that I will implement KYC before I start using it again.  It got closed anyway (In fairness tho, it was not the decision of the person I spoke to).

&gt;I am willing to implement KYC if thats what the banks require. The truth is that they do not accept that.

&gt;I do not know the banks motivations, but it seems to me the AML/KYC excuse is just that.",2015-09-22 13:22:31+00:00,cva4vcm,1,t3_3lxm2x,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I have a bank account in Brazil and a bank account in England. I am currently living in England but I do have monthly income made in Brazil that I'd like to transfer and have it in England. 

&gt;However the economic scenario in Brazil right now is depressing and on the top of that the charges to transfer overseas through my bank are ridiculous. It seems that the exchange through BTC - in numbers are even more drastically if I buy BTC with BRL aiming to convert to GBP. (but I still would like to confirm further details) 

&gt;So I have been thinking of buy BTC in BRL (where the income is - Brazilian bank account) and once the amount in BTC sell it here in UK and transfer it in GBP to my UK bank account.

&gt;However I am not experienced yet with BTC at this level and so far what I could see is that I can do this sort of operation in different ways. In all of them it involves different fees/commissions. I would like the opinion from people that have more experience with bitcoins so could point the most feasible alternatives on this case.

  &gt;I am still grasping the idea of 21's 'computer', but the more I think about it the more I am convinced the real value is in the OS and whole marketplace solution (aka console).

&gt;**Would't it be easier to just ditch the hardware part and focus on the software?**

&gt;Imagine your PC, which is doing the same what 21's computer: it's mining small amounts of bitcoin and is used as a node in the marketplace. It provides a service that can be sold for dust bitcoin - for example the now famous translation API.

&gt;Would it not be easier to build a software with sort of microtransactions server and put it on any device you want? It it was open sourced I see a lot of potential there, eg. installing this on smartphone.

  &gt;I wanted to make a post of my interpretations of current state of sentiment and trading operations of bitcoin trading and see if others share similar views:

&gt;1) Since mid-January (9months) we have been rangebound/trendless/sideways essentially between $200-300 with fakeouts to the upside and downsides. There certainly has been a general loss of interest by traders as many have turned to trading other markets -- here is a TradingView Chat activity of Bitcoin VS Forex VS Stocks and indexes:  [http://imgur.com/8LyeHjt](http://imgur.com/8LyeHjt)  

&gt;2) Volume across exchanges doesn't seem to be waning that much which would be indicative of what we would see in despair phase of a bear winter -- I am not suggesting this as any inflection point or calling an end anytime soonâ„¢ but we are seeing the rise of Skynet again as it appears Bitstamp has bought the ever effective Star OKCoin volume washing bot:  [http://imgur.com/q6EAkle](http://imgur.com/q6EAkle)  -- we also see the return of the random 10k BTC candles appearing again on OKC spot which used happen almost daily.

&gt;3) The traders/degenerate gamblers are the last people still interested in bitcoin in such a committed way IMO -- yes there are those 21inc companies and blah blah but really I don't know anyone else who is still waking up to bitcoin price alarms or forgoing activities when price action calls. And now we are even seeing some of this interest wane as I believe the ramping up volume washing bot activity is the Casino trying to keep the lights flashing and the sounds blasting so that we keep wanting to play the game. Take a look at the volume on Stamp when it introduced that MM bot:  [http://imgur.com/MZdxIdp](http://imgur.com/MZdxIdp) ",2015-09-22 06:32:15+00:00,cv9y6v0,1,t3_3lwo01,9,BitcoinAll

This has been mildly successful. But what if we added Bitcoin and smart contacts into the mix? Could we change the incentive structures and distribute (not democratize) the content creation process. Amazon has shown us that democratization doesn't work in scripted content. Tastemakers are needed. This think tank might be akin to the core devs in an open source project. How do we create a business that would run itself and produce quality films by quality filmmakers? How do we break up oligarchies in business? Imagine a Pixar like movie studio that's run by a program. The collective of filmmakers within the studio abide by the incentivized rules of the program and compete to make the best films. They are given raises etc... When the films do well. For example instead of making 1 200 million dollar movie like the studios are intent on doing, this new studio would make 20, 10 million dollar genre films. This would provide a higher rate of return while simultaneously giving the studio diversification across the market. Now obviously creating a film is a complex task that machines won't be able to do effectively for hundreds of years. So humans would be running this thing. I'm just talking about an incentive system in the middle that causes a breakdown in the studio system as we currently know it. A method to decentralize the power. im a filmmaker and I know In this particular instance how many good films go unmade. If we were able to decentralize Hollywood it would greatly benefit everyone, by delivering a treasure trove of highly immersive content.",2015-09-22 04:55:37+00:00,cv9w88h,1,t3_3lwfgx,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Note from FAQ ( [https://21.co/faq/):](https://21.co/faq/):) 


&gt;...You can indeed make a profit with the 21 Bitcoin Computer. However, you would do so not by directly selling bitcoin, but by selling digital goods for bitcoin. That is, you are not going to get rich by immediately selling the bitcoin mined by the device for offline currency, but you can potentially do very well by selling digital goods and services to others for their bitcoin.
**This should make sense: Bitcoin mining for the purpose of selling BTC on an exchange has the economics of a commodity business, while your globally accessible Bitcoin-payable API can have the economics of a software business.**""


&gt;VP's Theory:  

&gt;What 21 Inc is selling, with this ""Bitcoin Computer"", is an idea.  It's the idea that the future of IoT value transfer and security applications, among other things, will be powered by the Bitcoin protocol.  It will sell the Bitcoin Computer in some volume to the likes of Cisco, Qualcomm, Honeywell, Nest, etc.  Prepackaged convenience.  Modular.  Standardized.  Great for their labs, and cheap (for a business).  

&gt;This would be a smart play on 21 Inc's part, if they believed they could eventually ""sell"" IoT manufacturers on the utility of the blockchain, for various value transfer and security applications.  A company like Nest might then be onboard with embedding a ""21 Inc chip"" within it's next smart thermostat (or whatever).

&gt;This would be the real payday.  The ""Bitcoin Computer"" is a cheap pilot program for 21 Inc's partners, business clients, etc.  If the protocol wins, in many ways everyone wins, since it adds more utility to IoT devices (which can now transact with each other, etc.).",2015-09-22 02:24:10+00:00,cv9rk5p,1,t3_3lvy7u,11,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Yeah its all sounds like not serious solutions, too complex and not very popular

&gt;But recently I realized something special about installing software from APK packages.

&gt;That what I believe make Android really awesome platform. Its not very complex even for a newbie to install apk. Yeah it might be dangerous and I have no idea how to fix it, because I'm not even a mobile developer.

&gt;But just think about this: the whole world is spinning around those two platforms: App Store and Play Market - that's currently what is all about.

&gt;Also compare mobile phones to computer devices, yes Windows and Mac OS desktop operating systems don't spin around any AppStore/PlayMarket solutions. 

&gt;If I would choose to trust unknown sources and risk catching some virus, I don't care I would trust unknown sources over centralized service (I store my Bitcoins in offline storage anyway so there's no virus that can get my Bitcoins)

&gt;I think the story of App Store &amp; Bitcoin showed their censorship capabilities. I believe that decentralized software (e.g. server for OpenBazaar) must be written in a decentralized manner not depending on things like App Store. Few years ago I thought that Apple's approach is the best, because it provides security, but now I realized that security isn't always means freedom, and I truly love Android for the ability to run software without permission from Google or any other corporation.

&gt;Apple doesn't provides such functionality and this should be huge warning for anyone to think about purchasing such device.",2015-09-22 01:43:34+00:00,cv9q38j,1,t3_3lvt0a,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I stand on the side of a shorter blocktime, with rewards proportional to the decrease.

&gt;So if we moved to 1/5 the blocktime, the payout would be 1/5. 

&gt;Every 2 minutes a block with 5 BTC would be produced (Until the halving).

&gt;This would better allow for BTC mining decentralization as well as reduce variance for miners in larger pools. 

&gt;Yes, this will increase the number of orphans but it **will not change the percentage of orphans**. Look at altcoins that have gone with lower timing, then apply the understanding that the higher mining profit from Bitcoin allows for an incentive to make sure your mining nodes are well connected throughout the network, thus reducing the probability of orphan blocks.

&gt;Oh and a side benefit would be that 1MB blocks would now effectively be 5MB blocks since 1MB/block and there are now 5x as many blocks per day mined.

  &gt;Some of the things coming from the Bitcoin Core developers are coming as a shock to non-developers. For example,  [/u/Luke-jr](/u/Luke-jr)  recently  [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3lqyqm/discussion_satoshi_it_would_be_nice_to_keep_the/cv8s2d1) :


&gt;Present-day light clients are insecure. You might as well be using a webwallet.


&gt;SPV clients as insecure as webwallets? Since when? 

&gt;Several Core developers have claimed, in various comments scattered across Reddit and the dev mailing list, that the Bitcoin white paper assumed that SPV (light) clients would have ""fraud proofs"", and that since it turns out they don't, all previous assumptions on the majority of users relying on light clients have been invalidated.

&gt;If this is indeed the case, it would be really good for this to be communicated widely to the Bitcoin user base, because otherwise we will have clashing expectations between the people building Bitcoin's code, and guiding its development, and the wider user base that support the economy.

&gt;Ever since Gavin stepped down as lead developer on Bitcoin Core, there has been no central source of information on what Bitcoin developers are planning, and the rationale behind those plans, that a non-developer can use. So, why not a blog of sorts? ",2015-09-21 23:28:29+00:00,cv9l8yi,1,t3_3lvba7,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;The number of full nodes on the Bitcoin network has dropped from 10k to 6k over the last couple years.  Small block size advocates insist that raising the block size limit will aggravate this trend toward centralization.  

&gt;Large blockers insist that making the network more useful is more important than maintaining high levels of network decentralization.  

&gt;But both sides seem to ASSUME that increasing block size will cause more centralization, and the debate thus centers around whether the enhanced usefulness is worth the ""cost"" of a more centralized network. 

&gt;But...will larger blocks increase centralization?

&gt;I'm not so sure.  The more useful the network, the more people and organizations have a vested interest in it's maintainance. Businesses, governments and NGOs who are dependent upon the block chain for certain aspects of their day-to-day operations will have a built in incentive to ensure that their competitors don't gain undue influence over the network.  

&gt;While raising the block size limit might make it too expensive for certain INDIVIDUALS in certain areas of the world to operate a full node, the cost for a business or a government (whether local, state, federal) or an NGO to do so will always be TRIVIAL.  Every Russell 2000 company could run a full node at a truly immaterial cost to its bottom line.  That's 2000 nodes right there.  Every city and county government could do the same.  Every college and University.  Every for profit or nonprofit business with revenues of more than a few million likewise.  That's many tens of thousands of potential nodes, and that's just in the US alone.

&gt;Seeing the US take such a lead in nodes, what are other country's and their businesses, especially more aggressive and hostile ones, going to do?  They are going to operate nodes themselves.  And they will incentivize businesses within their borders to do the same, perhaps even by offering up tax incentives or the like.   

&gt;Tl;dr--Making the Bitcoin network more useful provides an inherent incentive for those organizations who use it to run full nodes, and the cost for them to do so will ALWAYS be trivial.  The more business, governments, universities, and NGOs use it, the more nodes we will thus have.  Competition among businesses and governments will ensure that no single or small group of entities gain control over any meaningful number of nodes.  In short, raising the block size INCREASES decentralization, contrary to the conventional wisdom on both sides of the debate. ",2015-09-21 19:31:27+00:00,cv9cc1s,1,t3_3lud0p,12,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Recently I submitted this issue to Coinbase:

&gt;Coinbase has a multisig vault, in which a key is generated for me the user, and the other is kept by Coinbase. Is there a way I could generate my own key and provide an xpub key instead?

&gt;I know the API allows you to create a multisig wallet by providing all the xpub keys, but there's seemingly no way to have Coinbase be one of the cosigners.

&gt;So on the one hand, Coinbase generates all the keys. On the other, the users generate their own keys and provide the xpub keys to Coinbase. Is there a middle ground mixing the best of both worlds?


&gt;While they find the answer, I was wondering if someone already found a workaround for this?",2015-09-21 18:51:17+00:00,cv9aq2w,1,t3_3lu6u0,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Iâ€™m excited to announce the beta launch of Sig3, the most secure way to transact with bitcoin. Sig3 is an automated cosigner redefining transaction security and improving the simplicity of multi-signature technology. Powered by a user-controlled policy engine, Sig3 allows users to set transaction policies that must be met before cosigning the transaction, and Sig3 can be integrated with any bitcoin wallet supporting multi-sig technology. We are thrilled to be fully integrated with the Copay wallet and are continuing development with a number of additional multi-sig wallets, as well as creating a web API to allow for future integration with all types of blockchain applications. Check out  [www.sig3.io](http://www.sig3.io)  and begin transacting with Sig3 security. ",2015-09-21 18:34:50+00:00,cv9a2wm,1,t3_3lu4em,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Bitcoin is at a turning point. Early in its infancy the creator Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a block size limit (1mb), saying the project was too small to defend itself with bigger blocks.

&gt;The idea was in the future the limit would be increased, by a community consensus. But even then a few people caught on to the ramifications and protested. If bitcoin blew up and got mainstream, convincing an entire community that is growing daily would be increasingly more difficult.

&gt;Satoshi never responded to the complaints.

&gt;Fast forward to the present and bitcoin is faced with a conundrum: 1mb blocks cannot support enough transactions for everyone to use bitcoin. Bigger blocks are needed, HOWEVER, bigger blocks necessarily effect the security of bitcoin.

&gt;Bitcoin seemingly has a choice, have large blocks and become owned by a few large corporations

&gt;Or

&gt;Become a very costly to use payment network that is ultra secure but too expensive to be used for average transactions.

&gt;The community has learned they cannot have their cake and eat it too, bitcoin is to be either and only a coffee money, or a new digital gold (high value settlement lay), but not both...

&gt;The global economy awaits the peoples choice.",2015-09-21 17:11:22+00:00,cv96srr,1,t3_3lts3j,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Even here, I know this will probably be downvoted into oblivion but we're wasting time by not talking about it and sticking our heads in the sand instead of addressing it head on:

&gt;Why is mainstream adoption going to happen? All of the previous spikes were due to speculative interest. Most people don't share our strong libertarian ideals. They want things that are effortless and solve real problems they have right now.

&gt;I think Bitcoin is brilliant but I can't crack this one critical issue. Clues out there suggest people are put off from Bitcoin before even trying to gauge if it solves a problem or not. See the ChangeTip survey data or BitPay's payment processing stats. That's not great but I think if there were some compelling service or product that absolutely required Bitcoin that stigma would quickly evaporate. Something with the popularity of Uber that only works with Bitcoin-- Uber is a bad example since they're more of a pull-payment mechanism and you obviously don't need Bitcoin for it to work but is there something that can fit this criteria?

&gt;Any ideas? Let's brainstorm...",2015-09-21 16:57:47+00:00,cv96a12,1,t3_3ltpxv,14,BitcoinAll

  &gt;On Sept 27th there is a high chance of independence of Catalonia from Spain. Such event will automatically push that region out of the European Union and the Euro. 

&gt;The Banks have already stated that in such case there will be no liquidity (aka ""Corralito"") for the citizens. Immediately most people sent a ""f*** you"" to the banks statement, but nevertheless getting out of the Euro means possibly going back to the peseta, which will grievously devalue people's savings.

  &gt;Forgive me for not having paid absolute attention, but from what I've seen from following this sub there have been very serious debates about forking or some other major controversial change. 

&gt;I was just wondering if by updating my wallet I somehow risk going in one or the other direction, leaving me unable to revert back to whatever it may be.. I'm sorry I'm not even sure if I understand what has been debated. Something about block size?

  &gt;On Sept 27th there is a high chance of independence of Catalonia from Spain. Such event will automatically push that region out of the European Union and the Euro. 

&gt;The Banks have already stated that in such case there will be no liquidity (aka ""Corralito"") for the citizens. Immediately most people sent a ""f*** you"" to the banks statement, but nevertheless getting out of the Euro means possibly going back to the peseta, which will grievously devalue people's savings. 

&gt;Some of my friends and family already contacted me regarding the possibility to get their first bitcoins as soon as possible. 

&gt;So far I told them about Local Bitcoins but is there a quicker way for converting large sums? One of my fears are banks blocking SEPA orders to Bitcoin exchanges.

  &gt;What is the deal with Circle always asking for information on who I sent the BTC to?  It is getting ANNOYING.  I've verified my account info and answered their interrogations questions honestly and accurately again, and again...

&gt;I buy BTC once to feed my hoarding habit.  Just about EVERY time I transfer the bitcoin out of their web wallet and into my personal wallet I get the following email:


&gt;Hi XXXXXXXX,

&gt;We noticed that you recently made a large transfer using Circle. That's great! Thanks for using our service.

&gt;We need to make a brief note about the transfers to comply with a regulation called the travel rule. This information is confidential and is only gathered to meet record keeping requirements. At your convenience please respond to this message with answers to the following two questions:

&gt;Regarding your transfer of [XXXXXXXXX BTC] on [XXXXXXXXX]:

&gt;1) What is the name of the recipient of this transfer, whether a company or an individual?
2) What is the address of the recipient of this transfer? (If full address is not known please provide as much information as possible)

&gt;Regarding your transfer of [XXXXXXXXX BTC] on [XXXXXXXXX]:

&gt;Please respond to this email with any questions you might have.

&gt;Best,

&gt;Betty, Team Circle


&gt;I guess ""the travel rule"" is some sort of AML requirement?  Why do I never get this interrogation from other exchanges?  Does Circle think I'm laundering money or something stupid?  I even googled the phrase  [""We noticed that you recently made a large transfer using Circle. That's great!""](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22We+noticed+that+you+recently+made+a+large+transfer+using+Circle.+That%27s+great!%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8)  and only got ONE search result.

  &gt;Some people has defined the small blockist side as the ""decentralist""

&gt;And I strongly disagree and that statement.

&gt;This got me thinking if there was a way to quickly describe each side.
So this is to me the accurate quick description I found.

&gt;The large blockist: the conservatist and decentralist side.

&gt;**Conservatist** because no change in bitcoin fundamentals will happen.

&gt;**Decentralist** because they want the blockchain prevalent and as cheap accessible as possible. And the blockchain is only fully distributed and centralised trestles system.

&gt;The small blockist: the hubs and efficiency side

&gt;**The hubs** because to grow with small block bitcoin will need hubs. (LN and other off chain Tx)

&gt;**Efficiency** because they want to keep a light and cheap to process blockchain and want/need the efficiency of hubs. (with centralisation consequences)

  &gt;Andrew Haldane said one solution would be for the Bank of England to issue a state-backed digital currency based on bitcoin. Supporting this initiative would be a negative interest rate levied on paper currency relative to the digital currency, with these measures do you think there is more possibilities that sometime:

&gt;Paper money will be banned entirely? 
How long do you think that happens?
would it work? 
What security and privacy risks would it raise? 
And how would public and privately issued monies interact?",2015-09-21 07:26:34+00:00,cv8t8eq,1,t3_3ls0n1,8,BitcoinAll

  &gt;For the last six months, I've been completely obsessed with Bitcoin. I've researched everything I can get my hands on pertaining to Bitcoin, economics, cryptography, and decentralized networking. Recently, I've been learning more with the  [Coursera Bitcoin course](https://class.coursera.org/bitcointech-001) . Currently, I only have basic level programming knowledge but a passion to pursue a career in technology. I'm a senior in college studying Philosophy (not the most practical degree, but I see it as a kind of Mental Engineering). Since my Philosophy degree in itself will not provide a meaningful source of income, I'd like to capitalize on my experience and knowledge of Bitcoin. Upon completion of the Bitcoin course, Coursera provides a Certification of Completion. This would bring more credibility to my knowledge and the idea of becoming a Cryptocurrency Consultant crossed my mind. Ideally, I would explain to businesses in simple terms how Bitcoin works and why it is important to innovate with this emerging technology.  I'm curious whether anyone else in the Bitcoin community has considered or pursued such employment. Would it be a better idea to teach myself a programming language that works with the Bitcoin API and if so, which language?",2015-09-21 04:30:42+00:00,cv8px1l,1,t3_3lrk2t,12,BitcoinAll

  &gt;ACN: How has the stock market crash in Shanghai and other markets affected LakeBTC?

&gt;Cho: Earlier this year the stock market heated up and attracted an enormous amount of money from everywhere, including the bitcoin market. Now the plummet obviously released some of the money back to alterative investment vehicles, and bitcoin is one of them. As you can see the price rose moderately in the past a few weeks. Hardcore bitcoin advocates have to realize that bitcoin is still a minority, even in ALT asset classes. The price stays low. Scandals after scandals. Stolen coins and compromised wallets. Politics and dog fights. Thereâ€™s still a long way to go to regain publicâ€™s attention and confidence.

&gt;What we can do at LakeBTC is to make our exchange a safe, liquid, and fair market for everybody. As a matter of fact we are probably the only exchange without any stolen coins or scandals since inception. We have a sizable user base and work with market makers and liquidity providers to better execute trade orders. And, we are the one exchange that cares about and stresses on fairness of a marketplace. We have market surveillance programs, carefully designed products, and no under-the-table deals with any bodoy. Unlike some other places, our business model is not to rip off the users.

  &gt;With banks and even governements considering their own alternative coins it is a matter of time to say goodbye to mainstream bitcoin.

&gt;Solution? Enable virtually all merchants of at least one  important country like England, USA or Germany to accept bitcoins. Make this setup for them with no cost or any hassle, leave a manual. Leave them ready to accept bitcoins when a customer appears even if it takes 5 years for one to appear.  Companies like BitPay could work on this. It is futile to push people to bitcoin if it is nowhere to be accepeted.

&gt;I thought it would be a real Xapo brand thing, but I think it's just a regular debit card. The only difference is that we 'load' it with bitcoins instead of dollars.

&gt;What is there to prevent A and B colluding so that A ""pays"" B 1M bitcoins per day (and B ""pays"" A the same ammount).

&gt;This would artificially create more work for themselves (and other miners). If mining is at all profitable, then generating zero-cost bogus transactions is a way of generating more demand for mining.

&gt;I understand you can attach some sort of commission to the transaction, so it increases the chance that some miner will pick up the transaction. But it is optional, and I cant see what is to stop an infinite number of A-&gt;B and B-&gt;A requests

&gt;The article implies some 60% of the minining market is controlled by about 5 miners, and I would imagine collusion of all sorts between them is happening (even if my scenario is bogus).

  &gt;Most of the arguments I've seen against raising the limit fall into one or both of the following two categories:


We should put off raising the limit, or resort to only kicking the can down the road with small increases in the limit, until a scaling solution can be found that does not increase validation costs. One account that commonly makes this argument is  [/u/smartfbrankings](/u/smartfbrankings) . For example,  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3llj0j/bigo_scaling_gavin_andresen/cv7iezs) :



&gt;The plan is to can-kick until scalable solutions are found.


&gt;""scalable solutions"", defined here, is a solution that doesn't increase validator workload at O(N) with increases in network throughput. 

&gt; [/u/110101002](/u/110101002)  often makes similar arguments, even arguing that economy of scale increases, categorically, would turn Bitcoin into a  [centralized currency](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3lmf5c/leaving_block_size_unchanged_will_have_bitcoin/cv7ldff) :


&gt;If we create more economies of scale and increase mining centralization then we will have a centralized currency and will be competing with centralized currencies which Bitcoin does not have the first mover advantage for.



Bitcoin can become a low-velocity high value settlement network, without any mainstream adoption as a currency for every transactions.


&gt;The  [/u/brg444](/u/brg444)  account commonly makes this argument, for example,  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3lniwl/fidelity_effect/cv8cuao) :


&gt;Bitcoin's future is clear to anyone with a bit of foresight: a low-velocity high value settlement network. bitcoins will be traded on a plethora of supplemental layers but it will cost you quite a bit to transact on the base layer. It's ok, this shall be an educational exercise for you I guess..!


&gt;This argument usually accompanies an extremely confident assessment of Bitcoin's ability to compete against clones, and appeal to wealthy investors, absent any demand as a transactional currency. For  [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3lniwl/fidelity_effect/cv8cuao) :


&gt;Bitcoin WILL be adopted by billionaires, investment funds and other high net worth individuals willing to escape the increasing capital controls, taxation and inflation. It's simply ignorant to pretend otherwise.


&gt;Use as a transactional currency is ridiculed and demoted in  [importance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3lmub3/comments_like_this_make_me_fear_that_the/cv8akzc) :


&gt;Do you really imagine that rich people care about what the common man can use or not? I don't see them being deterred from using gold because ""people"" can't use it, same with diamonds or off-shore accounts.

&gt;It's quite naive to put this much importance into this ""transactional"" network effect. It is by all evidence not the driver of Bitcoin adoption.


&gt;If there are any other commonly used arguments used, please let me know, and I will list them.",2015-09-20 23:32:15+00:00,cv8fzri,1,t3_3lqiyz,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I just came to think that bitcoin might be the answer to finally getting rid of annoying music DRM systems that prohibit users from doing things like making backups of their song files. Bitcoin could be utilized to easily track the ownership of mp3-files in a way that would make illegal copying very difficult but that would also allow consumers to resell their music files if desired.

  &gt;Here is a section on the history of things that have happened in Bitcoin since it was created, the technology and people that allowed for the creations of btc, and some history of money


































One local school was kind enough to return my emails and they asked if I thought I could teach the course, after some deliberations I said I could. As I am not a programmer I thought I could teach everything but the programming parts.
So I set out to write down everything about Bitcoin that I thought I knew after reading about it for a number of years. Then I looked up each point, gathering more info and sources on it. Now I have over 130 pages of info and research that I would like to share with you guys. 
The Bitcoin world is much faster to understand these days with all the great videos and explanations, but since it took me so long to figure it all out I thought others might not want to do all that work and instead just have all the info in one place.

&gt;So here in my unofficial and hardly readable but packed with information draft of 'Teaching Bitcoin 101' By Jack Andrews.",2015-09-20 17:15:58+00:00,cv8148k,1,t3_3lp0m0,4,BitcoinAll

&gt;Bitfinex and BitGo Partner to Create Worldâ€™s First Real-Time Proof of Reserve Bitcoin Exchange

&gt;Posted: June 04, 2015 20:04

&gt;We are very excited to unveil our new Bitcoin settlement system and security architecture that for the first time ever offers complete segregation of all customer bitcoins. Based on BitGoâ€™s revolutionary multi-signature technology, we are now able to provide individual multi-signature wallets for each customer, allowing traders to verify funds on the Blockchain for complete transparency while retaining institutional-level security.

&gt;Starting today we will begin using unique sets of keys for each user, and will separate each userâ€™s funds on the public blockchain. This powerful combination of BitGoâ€™s multi-sig technology with our exchange mitigates most of the shared pool security risks while simultaneously enabling users to verify their individual holdings on the blockchain.

&gt;We will start migrating users' accounts to the BitGo system over the next couple days. We hope to have the full migration completed in less than a week.


&gt;TL;DR: Bitfinex said they were going to have a real-time proof of reserves through BitGo in less than a week.... over 3 months ago. 

&gt;What happened? There's too many rumors flying around about insolvency (although I don't really believe them), but it would be nice if I knew they weren't insolvent due to the proof of reserve system they said they were creating in June. Would probably also get some customers and their trust back. Paging  [/u/zanetackett](/u/zanetackett) ...",2015-09-20 15:53:54+00:00,cv7y81r,1,t3_3looq2,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;We just released a  [Cryptowatch](https://cryptowat.ch)  update that makes it trivial to embed our real-time charts anywhere on the web. You can see a live example here:  [https://cryptowat.ch/news/embeddable-charts](https://cryptowat.ch/news/embeddable-charts) 

&gt;The new embedded chart interface is significantly stripped down to use screen real estate more efficiently.

&gt;To embed a chart simply open  [the new ""Embed"" menu in the footer](https://i.imgur.com/FjkL1mz.png)  and copy &amp; paste the code provided.

&gt;The generated embed code automatically includes your exact local configuration - this means you can control which indicators, overlays, color scheme, and time period are rendered by the embedded chart.

&gt;That's it for now. We have some new markets coming soon, and wider market support for our trading interface. I will write another update soon.

  &gt;So I'm at a wedding and I've been chatting up Bitcoin with my cousin, and now he wants to try it. So I'm ready to send him some coins, but this is not so simple. He has to: open the app store, find a bitcoin wallet that he likes, download that, open it, go through some setup process with warnings and such about backing up and losing his coins, create a passcode which he might forget, etc. Then after that I have to tell him to click on the ""receive"" button (or whatever that wallet has) and hold up his phone for me to scan the QR.

&gt;What I would like to do: 
Open a website on my phone that lets me enter his email address or phone number which then generates a receiving address for me to copy and paste into my wallet so that I can send the coins to that address.  So the work is all on me.

&gt;After I send the coins he would get an email or SMS with a link which would let him, open a minimal ""web enabled"" wallet that does not require login (link would be all they need). Once they click the link it immediately shows them their balance. So they use tools they already know (email, sms, web).

&gt;Blockchain My Wallet has some features like this (send via email), but only if you have a My Wallet account already and then the setup process on the receiving side is still complex. Blockchain doesn't even let you send via email from their iOS app (AFAIK).

&gt;Of course there are issues, like would this service know the private key they generate for the recipient, and is there a way to avoid that? Email snooping, is also a security issue, etc. But the ease of sending anyone bitcoins, with no requirement for them to setup anything in advance and no requirement for me to use a particular wallet for sending might overcome some of these issues (if they can't be solved).

&gt;I'm curious to know of other solutions out there for this (is anyone ""killing it""?) and if other bitcoiners would find this useful.",2015-09-20 14:58:58+00:00,cv7woyc,1,t3_3loi9c,9,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I keep hearing people talking about Bitcoin's anonymity. Bitcoin cannot be anonymous and it cannot give you anonymity either. Anonymity is something that you have to provide for yourself and practice all the time. Every single time you connect to the internet you can behave in ways that put your privacy and anonymity first and foremost. You can use tools like encrypted VPN and the Tor network religiously. You can abstain from all forms of social media interactions or posting anything that could be used to identify you. These days you very nearly are required to train your mind like a ninja so as to be continuously aware of the myriad bits of self-identifying data being leaked by your particular internet habits all the time. However, if you did do all the right things, if you trained your mind to be an online shadow ninja, if you completely erased or disconnected yourself from any personally identifying data at all ... and used bitcoin ... then for you, yes, bitcoin is anonymous. My point is that most people miss the point about what anonymity actually is. It's something that you have to have not something bitcoin has as some sort of de-facto design feature. If you are not anonymous when you use bitcoin, no anonymity can possibly be granted to you by the blockchain. However, if you are careful to protect your anonymity then bitcoin will not spoil your efforts. It can't. Not because it's anonymous but because you are.",2015-09-20 11:37:47+00:00,cv7t11v,1,t3_3lo07l,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Meetup Growth Summary September 2015

&gt;As the number of groups increases on this list the data becomes more interesting and the rankings more competitive.   We added 3 groups this month, and for the first time 2 of them are not from the Meetup site.   First, the Shire (Manchester, New Hampshire) group which claims to be the oldest meetup in USA. Second, Free State Bitcoin Consortium, and third Bitcoin Meetup Switzerland which makes its debut at #5 in the rankings.  Welcome to the monthly rankings.  If you are part of, or know another group that should be on this list please let me know in the comments.

&gt;Here is the link to the spreadsheet on Google docs: (the filtered tab is probably the easiest to view, set the date at the top and sort by growth % Zâ†’A for best view)  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FBCAMXzmfNE9bWneQK-Bah5eBS2iq507hVoX-QVN238/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FBCAMXzmfNE9bWneQK-Bah5eBS2iq507hVoX-QVN238/edit?usp=sharing) 

&gt;Always interesting to see which meetups rank the highest each month, we have Bitcoin London (the smaller of the 2 London meetups) taking the #1 spot for the first time with 36 new members and just over 7% growth, well done.  The always high ranking Bitcoin Wednesday Amsterdam moved up 4 spots to #2 with 60 new members and 6.2% growth.  Taking spot #3 was Barcelona Bitcoin Community, 36 new members for 5.5% growth.  They moved up 7 spots from #10 last month to #3 this month.  Again this group is always growing quickly. 

&gt;This month saw the San Francisco Bitcoin Meetup pass the London Bitcoin Meetup to become the second largest meetup group on our list at 2,516 members.  The largest absolute number of new members added was Israel Bitcoin Meetup (#10) with 67 new members, great job.

&gt;Notably 4 different meetups; Stanford Bitcoin Meetup, Israel - btc entrepreneurs, Bitcoin Budapest, and Bitcoin of South Florida saw their memberships shrink by 2 members each this past month.  What happened there guys? 

&gt;Big moves up included Israel Bitcoin Meetup gaining 11 spots 21st â†’ 9th, Barcelona Bitcoin Community moving up 7 spots 10th â†’ 3rd and Bitcoin Stockholm up 8 spots 25th â†’ 17th.  Keep it up. 

&gt;The losers this month include the 4 groups mentioned above plus Silicon Valley dropping 10 spots 11th â†’ 21st, Bitcoin San Fran 16th â†’ 23rd and Bitcoin Munich which had debuted at #1 last month falling to #11 this month.

&gt;If you would like your meetup added to the list just ask.  Good luck to all you meetup organizers this month.  If you have any big events coming up post them below.  I also post this to  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin) 

&gt;Based on growth percentage this month, here are the Power Rankings top 10 meetups

  &gt;Today, without any prior notice, Cryptsy increased its withdrawal fees to 0.5% of your withdrawal plus 0.001BTC ( [https://www.cryptsy.com/pages/fees](https://www.cryptsy.com/pages/fees) ). The previous withdrawal fees were 0.001BTC. They have removed trading fees at the same time, which were previously 0.25%. Even taking into account the removal of trading fees, many customers will still be worse off under the new fee policy. For example, I had a significant amount of bitcoin stored in the exchange for trading. Now I cannot withdraw this without paying 0.5% to Cryptsy. By increasing withdrawal fees with no advance notice to users, Cryptsy has effectively just stolen 0.5% of deposits in the exchange.

&gt;When Bitfinex changed their fee policy recently, they gave people almost 2 weeks prior notice of the change. Cryptsy on the other hand gave people zero notice. This is extremely unprofessional, and I recommend staying well away from this exchange.",2015-09-20 08:31:22+00:00,cv7qrg5,1,t3_3lno2e,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Looking at the transaction charts it appears we have some time to procrastinate as the 1mb limit is a way off. But of course what we can see is only half the story..

&gt;From  [/u/Bittburger](/u/Bittburger) :


&gt;We are already at the limit.
Companies are trying to build on the Bitcoin bitcoin block chain today, and can't, because of its limitations. Yet you still think we should kick back and chill until the limit for coffee shop transactions is reached, then nudge it up a bit.
This viewpoint will be the very reason network effect and first mover advantage will be lost. Mark my words.


&gt;And from  [/u/cypherdoc2](/u/cypherdoc2) :


&gt;We ARE in fact already at the limit. Companies and individuals are already making decisions whether to participate or pass on Bitcoin.
This is the Fidelity Effect.


&gt;With so far unseen but extremely well funded bitcoin killer settlement chains being developed by and for the banks as well as by and for trading platforms, it is easy to get swept up with Bitcoin's first mover advantage.

&gt;Some deluded individuals are even decrying VC funding and suggesting mainstream adoption can be put off until some nebulous time in the far future. The reality is that may have been true 2 years ago, but bitcoin needs to reassert it's dominance quickly. It is no longer the most technically capable of advancedn in existence - it is now simply first. The speculative value associated with the chain and individual currency unit is predicated on either corporate or mainstream adoption (or both) of bitcoin over competitors.

&gt;**TLDR**: everyone seems to now agree bitcoin can and must scale (what a surprise). It is time for those controlling Core to wake up and act like the stewards of a multi billion dollar enterprise before they strangle the project into irrelevance through benevolent inaction.",2015-09-20 07:14:09+00:00,cv7ppkk,1,t3_3lnj0h,4,BitcoinAll

&gt; [Github Full Description](https://github.com/1MichaS1/BIP100dotFive) 

&gt;I wrote a simple proposal for combining the best of BIP-100 and BIP-101, so I called it ""BIP-100.5"" for now.

&gt;I focussed on...


Decentralization
User adoption over time
Technological progress over time
The uncertainty of the two above
Interests of the eco-system
Interests of the miners
Reasonability and pragmatism
Likelihood of adoption
Simplicity of implementation


&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;This BIP proposes to replace the fixed 1 MB block size limit with an adaptive limit that can float between 1 MB and 61 GB (temporarily 1..32 MB) based on a default growth rate and miner voting. This combines the merits of BIP-100 and BIP-101 within a new generalized mechanism. Both BIP-100 and BIP-101 can be considered special cases of this BIP, depending on the choice of hard-coded parameters.

&gt;Fierce proponents of BIP-100 and BIP-101 respectively will probably not like any other proposal than ""their's"" - for the vast majority I am hoping it can be a reasonable compromise that can achieve wide consensus.

&gt;The reason why in this BIP the default growth rate is not 0.0% but some moderate positive value is that the default should, at least in tendency, follow the ""bathtub"":

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Centralization
of Bitcoin system
  .

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt;Left edge = centralization due to too low capacity (tx per second, congestion, users pushed off-chain).
Right edge = centralization due to too high bandwidth + storage requirements.
Both edges move to the right as time passes, this BIP's default growth tries to stay in the flat area of the bathtub.
Voting enables deviation from the default growth.

  &gt;The recent ruling is another example of why regulation is an innovation killer.  Now contract issuers who use bitcoin as the medium of exchange are going to be under the regulatory gun.  Anyone innovating in this space is now going to fail unless they are backed by deep (corrupt banking) pockets.

&gt;Remember that regulation does NOT protect people, rather it centralizes the points of failure to make the systems fragile and more susceptible to catastrophic failure that must be bailed out by taxpayers.

  &gt;Wendell, founder/creator of Hive, here.

&gt;I posted two responses to this:

&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3llr1a/hive_wallet_no_longer_being_developedtime_to_bail/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3llr1a/hive_wallet_no_longer_being_developedtime_to_bail/) 

&gt;My responses mysteriously did not appear in the thread, so they are copied below.

&gt;1) A general response...

&gt;It wasn't the ""web guy"" you spoke to, it was me, Wendell, the founder/creator.

&gt;I apologize for the issues people have been having with Hive, and you're right, I probably should have announced the glacial (not entirely frozen, see below) development of Hive, but on the other hand I assumed that everyone knows our GitHub URL ( github.com/hivewallet ) and could easily make that judgment for themselves.

&gt;Hive Web and Hive iOS are BIP32/BIP39 compatible, so you should be able to directly use your passphrase in any other wallet supporting this standard, including the excellent Bread Wallet, and I believe Mycelium as well.

&gt;It would be nice if some new maintainers for one or more of the platforms appeared, because with the patches that Wei created recently ( live @  [http://hive-js.herokuapp.com](http://hive-js.herokuapp.com)  ) it actually does work fine. However, these changes have not been rolled into the iOS version, and no one left over here who might touch it uses OS X for development anymore.

&gt;**We'll keep our servers on for anyone who needs them, but the wallets are basically unsupported, and we recommend using something else.**

&gt;2) In response to  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3llr1a/hive_wallet_no_longer_being_developedtime_to_bail/cv7cism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3llr1a/hive_wallet_no_longer_being_developedtime_to_bail/cv7cism) 

&gt;I'm pretty sure that you're just commenting on open source wallet businesses generally speaking, but for the record: Hive is and has always been open source.

&gt; [http://github.com/hivewallet/](http://github.com/hivewallet/) 

&gt;To the other comment, what you say is indeed true, and it's a real shame considering the strong momentum (  [http://stats.hivewallet.com/](http://stats.hivewallet.com/)  ) and the high quality of the overall application design.

&gt;We actually have a pretty awesome new product planned, something which could make money without a grotesque compromise of ethics and integrity, and we're trying to gather up the funds for it presently. This would also allow us to finally resume development of the existing wallets. We'll post here if that works out, fingers crossed.",2015-09-20 01:54:31+00:00,cv7i1p3,1,t3_3lmox4,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I used the Hive wallet for over a year to store my bits without any issue. Earlier in the week I started to have trouble logging into my wallet. When I opened  [https://web.hivewallet.com](https://web.hivewallet.com)  the icon would show up and dissapear but the login screen wouldn't show up. I had to dig around online to find an email address to contact. I could only find an address for Mac support and when I messaged them they gave me an address for web wallet support (None of theses address are on their website). After 3 days I had to email the Mac address again because I got no answer from the Web address. They finally got in touch with me today but by that time I had been able to log in on a VERY old laptop and transfered all my bits to another wallet. I told the Web guy I no longer required his help or their service and he said:


&gt;Probably a good idea. Hive isn't actively developed anymore.


&gt;I told him to let the rest of their users know that since their website is shit and doesn't offer any help. So anyone still using Hive I recommend moving to another wallet",2015-09-19 21:21:10+00:00,cv79upd,1,t3_3llrb0,13,BitcoinAll

&gt;Having watched the video I found it very moving. This bloke Ingo Pless literally found Abbey when she was in a mental hospital and set her out to be the face of a marketing campaign to promote this 'Fork the Banks' project.

&gt;She's now worried everyone will hate her for her part in the deception, but clearly she hasn't done well financially out of this and clearly this is a relationship with an unhealthy balance of power.

&gt;I hope Abby comes back from this and there are consequences for Pless who sounds like a scum bag. It's actions like this will be associated with the Bitcoin community as a whole unless they are dealt with swiftly.",2015-09-19 21:07:31+00:00,cv79fme,1,t3_3llpiy,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;A few years ago, I was a big proponent of LocalBitcoins. But over the last few years, I've been hearing stories of police stings and even people going to jail over face to face Bitcoin transactions. I'm sure it has something to do with the U.S's AML laws or something like that. But it still leaves me wondering: is meeting someone face to face to buy or sell Bitcoins illegal?

&gt;I understand the dangers of doing so as in people have gotten robbed, beaten up, and maybe even killed, but I'm more concerned about the legality. Is this one of those ""it's not really illegal but they don't like it"" type things or is there some legal issue here?",2015-09-19 20:05:06+00:00,cv77h29,1,t3_3llh0x,8,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Unfortunately, bitcoin is the only option I have to withdrawal on one of my online poker networks.

&gt;I have 15K total in withdrawals, 5k each time into bitcoin wallet. 

&gt;Is it safe to open a new bank account, and then withdrawal the bitcoins from bitpay to my new bank account?

&gt;I read a lot of banks don't like bitcoin and I don't want my funds to be permanently frozen. 

&gt;I'm too scared to use my existing bank account in fear they close it.

&gt;Any suggestions?",2015-09-19 19:09:59+00:00,cv75qs6,1,t3_3ll9cj,4,BitcoinAll

&gt;Crippling Bitcoin just out of the fear that the government might one day go after you, is not very wise.

&gt;If that is the case then no threat model or small blocks are gonna save you.
As history shows, even if you go as deep as Dread Pirate Roberts, you will eventually be caught and prosecuted.

&gt;So the best protection against governments is to grow and become a significant force in the world.

  &gt;When I first heard about the Lightning Network concept, I thought it to be a neat idea whose value add to Bitcoin was obvious: microtransactions made possible etc.

&gt;With the recent debate surrounding the max block size increase, it was interesting to witness the emerging alignment w.r.t. BIP101 and XT.

&gt;With most of the Bitcoin Core devs being paid by Blockstream, and Blockstream's inherent interest in the success of the LN, the LN becomes an important piece of the puzzle with regards to the current politics (maybe the most important, at least to Blockstream). 

&gt;Therefore, the whole LN concept merits a whole lot more scrutiny and deep thought beyond my initial enthusiasm.
Like many here probably, I am attracted to Bitcoin due to the fact that if I wanted/needed to, it would be possible to get some degree of anonymity in its acquisition and transaction, preventing interference and retaliatory actions by established players (banks, governments, petty criminals, etc). In other words, the increased autonomy and decentralisation afforded by Bitcoin.

&gt;If LN becomes the dominant way to transact, with the Bitcoin blockchain being used only for settlements and perhaps with much larger fees, these benefits would largely disappear.
Even worse, with LN ""hubs"" becoming a practically necessary ""middle man"", these hubs will gain de-anonymisation power over the users who wish transact using them.

&gt;The could be run by companies such as Blockstream, or large financial institutions licensing the LN technology, but it'd boil down to the status quo we already had before Bitcoin: others having the power over your financial transactions.

&gt;I'd appreciate your further thoughts about this, since there are a lot more knowledgeable people in this sub, and I may be overestimating the detrimental impact possible due to LN.

  &gt;If for example you bought $100,000 in bitcoin (166 coins) in 2014 and sold all the coins in 10 years assuming it jumped to 60,000 per coin in 2024 and make $9,960,000, what would be your tax deduction on long term capital gain (if that is the correct term). I hear it's considered property tax. Saw post on here about taxes but still confused. Just like answer to that scenario above. Be happy to answer any details if needed. I paid and would sell in U.S., Florida specifically. Typically I understood income over 400,000 is taxed at 39.6% thereabout, not sure if percentage would be much lower if long term gain vs short term.

  &gt;Hi fellow BTC people!

&gt;I've been contemplating investing in BTC for a while now - not a lot of money, I'm a student, but maybe just buying around 2-3 BTC and hope they'll be worth more in  6-12 months.

&gt;Do any of You guys do that, and has it paid off? Would it be possible to buy a couple BTC using an exchange and then exchange them for dollars immediately when the price goes up? 

&gt;I'd also like to hear what exchanges You guys recommend. Hard to keep up with all the ones closing / getting hacked / not updating canaries.

&gt;Also, this idea might be very stupid, if so please tell me ;-)

  &gt;Could you live off bitcoin. I mean could you buy a car and a house with bitcoin, and just exchange a small portion of your bitcoin for cash each month to cover living expenses (food, rent, mortgage, school, misc, etc.) Can this be done, or is there anybody who is legitimately living off bitcoin. Are there services out there today that allow you to purchase cars or houses. If you were to buy a car or house in bitcoin would it be reported, and would you have to pay taxes on that?

&gt;How can bitcoin revolutionize micropayments when fees are so significant?

They asked for TX hash for that today and I provided it. I was hoping this would be an easy ""oh look there is it, and there you go"" and I could show off more this weekend, but I fear nothing will happen till next weekend.

  &gt;Hi all,

&gt;I'm a cryptocurrency enthusiast and have lots of experience in the field.

&gt;I'm making myself available as your personal Bitcoin consultant from just $5/day.

&gt;If you're a total newbie or you want to improve your current knowledge, I can help!

&gt;I can teach you how to obtain Bitcoins, how to trade them, how to accept them as payment for goods and more.

&gt;My services are also available via Fiverr - PM me for further details.

&gt;I'm sure the majority here would not require my services, but you may know someone who might.
Many thanks",2015-09-18 22:01:01+00:00,cv6cl34,1,t3_3lhj2x,14,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hi there,

&gt;People will find out about it sooner or later, so better for me to create a post here first.
I'm currently handling the preparation of a blockchain hackathon in Dublin, as far as I know the biggest in Europe.
We will push some PR next week, but in the mean time I sent a few tweets about it for my followers to test the ticketing system and review the website before next week.

&gt;The event will happen just after the Web Summit which is a major event in Europe, we hope to get some of the attendees staying for the weekend and participate too (as I don't believe many people will fly just for the hackathon).

&gt;In short:


150 participants
â‚¬10k cash prize
Good food provided
Dublin!


&gt;We will provide workshops/mentoring and have the support of a few Bitcoin startups to help us out during the weekend.

&gt;You can find some more info on  [https://blockchain-hackathon.com](https://blockchain-hackathon.com) 

&gt;I'm happy to listen to any feedback you might have, I can't announce the sponsors before next week, and no, there is no Bitcoin integration for the payments on the website, but we can take it manually.

&gt;See you there maybe,

&gt;Kevin

  &gt;I have over $1,500,000USD in illegal bitcoins. They are not stolen but they have been earned through illegal online sales. I have various people who will buy my bitcoins and send me cash in the mail, anonymously. So converting to cash is not a problem. I am more than willing to pay taxes on this. But even if I do claim my income and pay my taxes, how do I go about using the funds freely (for example buying an exotic car, condo, expensive toys). People will get suspicious and start asking questions (the government) as to how I got all that cash. What do I tell them? Or where can I find a legal professional that would have my back when it comes to dealing with the government and the IRS. Even if I have to pay my lawyer half of my money, I would be able to spend it freely. Half of 1 million that you can freely spend is better all of 1 million that you cant spend and have to look over your shoulder every time you try pull out some cash.

First they ignore bitcoin - early years 2008-2010
Then they laugh at bitcoin - nerds money etc
Then they fight bitcoin - 2011-2013, DPR, Gox, MSM campaigns
Then they study it - 2014, you see the first delclarations in media from banksters that they will gonna study the blockchain etc
Then they try to adopt bitcoin - see the last news that 9 banks wants to build something based on blockchain or their blockchain (still unclear)
Then they failed adopting it - will see this soon

  &gt;UPDATE: looks like I am shit out of luck! They are not going to do anything for me. They just took my $50. How the hell does this happen? Someone have my IP address? As far as I am concerned this whole company is a scam. I just got fucked. 

&gt;have heard good things about the convenience of LibertyX and thought that I would give it a shot today. This is my first BTC purchase. 

&gt;So I drive 30min round trip to the store and purchase the Qpay pin. I get home and log into my account and try to redeem the BTC and have it sent to my other wallet. 

&gt;When I click send I get a pop up that my account has been temporarily closed until I contact support. So I contact support assuming I just need to verify some info and things. 

&gt;The guy tells me at first things like, ""sometimes they close accounts on accident"" ""this happens sometimes with new accounts"" etc etc. 

&gt;Then. He tells me that 6 other accounts have used 2 of the IP's of the 3 that I have logged in with!!? Wtf?? I have no idea what that is all about. 

&gt;So now I spent this $50 and I'm apparently a suspect in fraud crimes or some shit. I'm completely oblivious to what he is referring to and feel like I am being scammed here.... 

&gt;Does this sound legit you guys? I kind of want to create a new account and redeem the pin like that but apparently they are monitoring IP addresses and shit. 

&gt;It's been about 30 minutes since last contact in going to contact them
Again.

&gt;Thoughts? 

&gt;If this doesn't get resolved I will never use LibertyX again! ",2015-09-18 18:43:46+00:00,cv65bap,1,t3_3lgrm8,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Amidst the continuing regulatory clusterfuck things keep getting murkier and murkier, we have:

&gt;The CFTC which claims Bitcoin is a commodity

&gt;Fincen which claims Bitcoin is currency

&gt;The IRS which claims Bitcoin is property

&gt;The SEC which claims in some cases Bitcoin is a security

&gt;And a whole bunch of state regulators discussing different ways to handle things in silly ways

&gt;Do you think the regulators are confused yet? 

&gt;Regulatory agencies are always going to reach for the maximum amount of power over things that they can - but at one point these agenciesâ€™ definitions are going to start rubbing each othersâ€™ the wrong way and when a company actually takes this issue to court it will need to be clarified as not all of these contradictory definitions could be held up simultaneously in a court. At this point we will have regulators fighting regulators all over the definition of particular bits of data stored in a certain way (and defining the lines on that is only going to get even murkier, are tokens used in a game money? Is a bit of data the contributes to a storage network incentive a security?)

&gt;If anything this attempt to pull Bitcoin and other virtual currencies in so many separate directions under umbrellas of old language really misses the point: Bitcoin does NOT fit any of these definitions properly and never will. This is because Bitcoin is a new concept that includes some of all of these but is much more than the sum of any of these definitions combined. Bitcoin already is and will be so much more than our language can even formulate at the moment, we will have to invent new thought and concepts to encompass it. Watching regulators put out their opinions feels like watching books and newspaper publishers argue about what the internet is in the early way days, the old ways of thinking no longer apply - we can not solve new problems with old thought, language, and definitions.

&gt;At this point the only working definition that makes any sense is that Bitcoin is a piece of electronic data that lives on a blockchain - anything past that is just speculation and could be out of date in weeks if not days as the technology progresses. Those jurisdictions that seek to apply old thinking in ways that stifle innovation will simply push those innovators to other jurisdictions that are not so close-minded as to try to apply century old definitions to a technology that cannot be defined with thinking and language that was not created to account for it.",2015-09-18 18:27:11+00:00,cv64o64,1,t3_3lgp34,6,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I would like to share my feeling in the current block size limit debate.

&gt;It seems to me that most of discussion is center about argument against big block danger and people responding to it.

&gt;This might give a false sense that increasing the block size is a very risky move as we all only talking about that and almost no discussion is about the possible downside of LN and the restricted capacity.

&gt;New comer might think: ""yeah why bother with increasing the block size LN will solve everything"" it appear indeed as an miraculous solution.. And that kill the debate.

&gt;And this is a mistake the conservative move is BIP101, increasing the block size (minimal code change, LN still possible, no dramatic shift in usage/fundamentals)

&gt;Restricting the blockchain and using LN as a only scaling tool is the risky move without a doubt (relying on a not even existing system is a huge leap of faith, drastic change on key fundamentals of bitcoin (trust, regulation weakness), massive code change..)

&gt;To make long story short:

&gt;Current discussion:
Small blockist:
Bitcoin is safe now; lot's of Tx are spam; LN will save us all; large block can carry a risk.
Large blockist: 
Mainly respond to the potential danger of large block.

&gt;But this argument has brought us nowhere because if you believe bitcoin is safe and somewhat ""mature"" in his current form indeed it would be stupid to make any change ""why taking risk?"" and on top of that ""LN might save the day"".

&gt;Unfortunately we see little argument like:

&gt;Large blackouts: *Bitcoin is fragile now because it is too small; limiting capacity have consequences; growth will increase decentralisation; LN might not be a good scaling system for bitcoin; the blockchain is neutral; the blockchain can have many unforeseen innovative use; growth strengthen bitcoin; how come LN be able to scale bitcoin if current bitcoin send on average few Tx per weeks/months?

&gt;It seems to me that we should be a lot more critic about LN and restricting the blockchain instead of being defensive.
**Not because it's a bad system/proposal but because it's a massive shift from the original bitcoin ideas** (mainly.. Use of hubs and their consequences on privacy/trust/regulation resistance)

&gt;**This is where most of the discussion should be!**
And if LN end up being a major part of the bitcoin future his potential downside has to be discussed so we all know where we are going.

&gt;Ps: It might come from the  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  moderation.. The theymos comment about how moderation can influence people immediately come to mind..",2015-09-18 16:46:34+00:00,cv60pvc,1,t3_3lga02,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Now. I know what your thinking. Are you a f*** ret****?
Right?
But please just listen.

&gt;Now look. I need $100 dollars in btc. But if you do pay me. I will pay you $125 (in paypal) 14 days later.

&gt;Now you want to know what the money will be spent on and why i need it.

&gt;The reason that I need it is because in my country, to buy anything online it is almost impossible. Due to the fact to buy something. First you need to call the bank 7 business days earlier. Then you need to tell them the exact date and time that the transaction will be made. After that you need to tell them the exact amount and if the amount is wrong well your shit out of luck. And you need to wait 7 days. Again. Then you need to tell the exact name of the person/company. Now how the fuck am i supposed to know that? And it has to be exact. Again. So its pretty much a massive pain in the ass. Put on top of that that paypal isn't here.

&gt;Now what I will do with it. I will buy a prepaid paypal account from a seller. After which once I have the account and everything is working correctly. I will pay you your $125 as soon as possible.

&gt;If you have any questions just ask.
If you want to invest just send me a pm.

&gt;Thanks, Moe Green",2015-09-18 16:23:04+00:00,cv5zs8b,1,t3_3lg6fs,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hey guys!! So, I have some coins in an Armory wallet and I want to transfer them to any other lightweight client (electrum looked good). 

&gt;The reason is that when I changed computer I lost all the blockchain (the 50gb+ files) required by armory to run, and now my internet connection is too slow to re-download it (it would take weeks). 

&gt;Apparently this is the only option. Is this true? Is there a way to maybe send them offline or something similar? 
Do I really have wait and wait for weeks now that I had finally found a way of using the coins online?

  &gt;Contrary to a recent thread claiming India was exploring Bitcoin for issuing cell phone minutes, there is purported to be  a bitcoin ban underway in India, as BTCXIndia was recently forced to close up shop. The company is the first bitcoin exchange designed and launched in the country and has complied with KYC and AML standards so the reason for its shutdown is still unknown.

&gt;This follows a period of raids and warnings and murky language from the Indian government.  What's the ground truth there?",2015-09-18 12:48:00+00:00,cv5sagm,1,t3_3lfd5v,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;This short story will tell you about how Bitcoin scammed $60 out of me.  
So I got sucked into this scam, so much that I'd stopped using my bank account, and I proudly told everyone, you can't just wire me money, I only use cash and Bitcoins.
In the last 2 weeks I got a phone call from an unknown number, every day at 3pm, but since I don't answer unknown numbers, I always turned it down.
Over time it became so consistently annoying, that I answered once.
My old bank called me that I have to pay $60 to them. ""What the hell? I don't use you for years, what's wrong with you?""
""But, you have to pay for the account every month and it added up over time.""
Fucking Bitcoin, it just made me forget how much I have to pay attention to the traditional banking system, even if I don't use them.
I long forgot what is an account management fee. Working days, working hours, etc. I had to go in and close my account manually. (""But you can't just do that, you have to book an appointment for that."")
Thank you Bitcoin, now I'm so volnurable for the traditional banking system scams, just because you exists.",2015-09-18 12:29:18+00:00,cv5ruae,1,t3_3lfb2e,10,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Fincen says it's a currency. So we have to register as a money services business and do KYC/AML whenever we exchange it. Oh, and two people in a room exchanging one digital currency for another digital currency is ""money transmission"" so you need 40+ money transmitter licenses for that. Oh, and the CFTC says it's a commodity so they can make you get a commodities trading license. The IRS says it's a commodity for tax purposes because, of course, if it were a currency, you'd pay less in taxes. Oh, you thought bitcoin-denominated shares and colored coins were revolutionary? Wait until you hear what the SEC thinks. Ask Voorhees. And now we have the pleasure of waiting for 40+ more states to pass their own bitcoin licenses. 

&gt;I wish we had a smart federal judge who could interpret these laws and tell the federal government what bitcoin actually is and what laws apply to it. Several cases have come to light which would have given a judge an opportunity to do so. But because the defendants were facing such heavy fines and jailtime, they all agreed to plea guilty for deals instead of going to trial. Can't blame them.

&gt;Another option is for the federal government to pass a federal framework (trumping state laws) that say how bitcoin must be treated. Fat chance of that happening any time soon. It would take years.

&gt;Another option might be for one of these bitcoin businesses to try to get a declaratory judgment from the American courts. They would essentially say that they are experiencing a harm in the form of  regulatory interference with their businesses because the CFTC, Fincen, Etc. are all defining bitcoin as different things and the exchange wants the courts to say exactly what it is and what regulations apply to it.  That would probably take at least a year or two. 

&gt;Conclusion: There's at minimum a 2 year window of time ahead of us where various government agencies and jurisdictions (like Lawsky's NYDFS) are going to have free reign to basically pile on and suck the blood from bitcoin. This will make running any bitcoin business or using bitcoin in any way a semi-legal affair.

  &gt;I just received an email from Fidor bank telling me they're actually launching in the UK. Previously they had no actual products, although signup to their community was possible.

&gt;This possibly significant for Bitcoin because parallels have been repeatedly drawn between the acceptability of Fidor's disruptive stance towards existing banks, and the disruptive nature of Bitcoin's ecosystem to existing banking mechanisms.

&gt;Fidor have until now supposedly been ""frozen out"" of UK banking by the existing bank establishment/cartel.

&gt;The text of the email:

&gt;We have some exciting news for you!

&gt;After bringing its innovative services to Germany, Fidor is now officially open to UK customers and community members, therefore becoming the first retail bank to launch in the UK since 2010!

&gt;We are very much looking forward to challenging the existing banking model and count on you to help us build the bank of your dreams, thanks to your feedback in the Fidor Smart Community.

&gt;Our current list of products includes Smart Current Account with a 0.25% interest paid on the balance, Savings Bonds and SEPA transfers, a Euro transfer service with a flat fee of Â£2.49. This is the beginning of our story in the UK and we will be releasing very soon new features and products, including a debit card. Stay tuned!

&gt;Smart Current Account

&gt;The Fidor Smart Current Account is free and easy to use and does not require any credit check. It also offers an attractive interest rate on the balance of your account. You simply won't believe just how easy it is to open an account with us. Read more

I'm poor. Others are smarter.
So either I need to run it by someone that is intelligent to understand the coding of bitcoin, wallets, and sidechain implementation, that wouldn't, couldn't steal my idea.  Or Bitcoin will need to wait for me to get educated.
Maybe I can get the concept patented/protected (whichever applies) before sharing. But I wouldn't know how to do that either.
Maybe I can write up a paper and hope I can clearly get the idea across to some Venture Capitalists?

  &gt;I noticed on 9/16 the remaining small amount of BTC in the Bitstamp hacked address moved.  

&gt;It appears the movement following may have been a bit more sloppy than before and the funds were combined in a multiple input tx (.0004). Regardless only the ""hacker"" or an associate would have access to this address. I don't know why for such a small amount the hacker would re-use the address, a mistake maybe?

&gt;I would love your help and feedback on how to track the coins associated, and if any of you feel the desire to contact the companies. Some coins appeared to actually go back to Bitstamp.net oddly enough.

  &gt;Bram's talk is  [here](https://t.co/XE3nAYP1Iw) . 

&gt;**The reason given for wanting a fee market make no sense**

&gt;Bram says:


&gt;the idea here is that you should have a market at this point


&gt;Bram thinks having a fee market right now would be good. Why does he think this? He continues:


&gt;I [...] proactively want to see this happen because we don't know what fees ""should be"" until we actually run the experiment of doing it and see what prices wind up being.


&gt;So Bram thinks that we will find out some useful information by having a fee market now. We'll know the what fees ""should be"" in some sense. However the only thing we'll find out is at what price the current demand curve intersects the current block size.

&gt;Bram seems to think that this number will in some sense be the ""right"" level of fees. It's just what fees are given that we've restricted supply to 1 MB, and given the current demand. 

&gt;Since everyone seems to agree that the block size should be raised at some point, and everyone seems to agree that demand will change (hopefully increase) in the future, finding out at which point supply and demand intersect right now isn't useful. We should have fees when they are necessary for Bitcoin's security. Forcing high on users before then just  [hurts growth](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/For_large_blocks#Growth)  and  [hurts users](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/For_large_blocks#Fees) . 

&gt;**Problems with Bram's argument against basing the fee you pay on past fees**

&gt;Bram considers the idea that wallets would look at fees in previous blocks and base their fees on that info. Bram thinks it suffers from an attack: miners could at some point send txns to themselves with high fees. This would result in a block in which all txns pay high fees, then users would think ""Gee, it looks like I need to pay a high fee to get my tx confirmed. OK then."" So users start paying high fees, which makes future blocks full of high fee transactions, which means users will continue to pay high fees indefinitely.

&gt;The problem is that this won't work when a fee market exists, because in that case the marginal user is already paying the highest fee that they're willing to pay to get into a block. As soon as miners stop making fake transactions to themselves with high fees, the marginal transactions in blocks will again have fees as low as before the miner's scheme, which will signal to everyone else that they can lower their fees again.

&gt;This fee raising scheme would only work if miners kept putting fake transactions in their blocks indefinitely. This has the effect of miners enforcing a soft block size limit which is lower than the hard limit, to reduce supply and drive up fees. They could already do this if they wanted to ( [miner voting systems like in BIP 100](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Specific_block_size_proposals#Miner_voting_scheme)  make this easier for them), although achieving it via fake transactions would be harder for the community to detect, and might be impossible to detect if 51%+ of miners form a cartel. 

&gt;There is one extremely unlikely situation in which the miners could cause indefinite high fees with a temporary manipulation of the fee market: if the demand curve looked like a step function such that enough txns to completely fill up a block would pay a high fee, and no txns that didn't make it into a block would pay a high fee. In this case, before the miner manipulation all txns would pay a low fee, and after the intervention all the txns that made it into blocks would pay a high fee. However this only works if the 'step' in the demand curve perfectly aligns with the block size limit. If the 'step' were to the right of the block size limit, users would already be paying high fees, and if the step were to the left of the limit then as soon as miners stopped manipulating the market they'd see fees drop back down. 

&gt;**The attack on SPV clients is overblown**

&gt;Bram discusses wallets estimating fees by looking at the mempool of unconfirmed transactions. He dismisses this because SPV nodes would have to ask full nodes for mempool information, and miners could just spin up a bunch of full nodes and lie to SPV clients about the necessary fees. 

&gt;The problem with this attack is that SPV clients can ask for info from full nodes when they aren't actually sending a transaction, so they can learn which full nodes are trustworthy. Wallet software will usually be online for a long time, and it can collect a lot of data about whether it's getting trustworthy data from full nodes. If a full node tells an SPV wallet that it needs to pay $1 in fees, and then the SPV wallet sees the next block full of txns that pay much lower fees, the SPV wallet will know not to trust that full node. SPV nodes will also know roughly in what range fees should be by looking at previous blocks, so it'll know that it should be wary any time a full node claims tx fees should be much higher than ones it has just seen in blocks.

&gt;**Bram's fee solution gives no advantage over looking at fees in previous blocks, and it's slower**

&gt;Bram argues that users should instead base fees only on information from transactions they have personally sent, and pay no attention to the fees in previous blocks or the mempool. In the strategy Bram recommends, you start by trying to send a tx with a low fee, then if that doesn't work you increase the fee, then increase again, etc. This continues until either your tx is confirmed, you hit either the highest fee you're willing to pay, or you reach the maximum time limit that you're willing to try this strategy for. 

&gt;Repeatedly sending transactions with higher fees is slow, and the problem this is trying to solve isn't a real problem when we're not in the extremely unlikely situation of the weird step function described above. If miners do form a cartel and effectively enforce a soft block size limit, Bram's strategy won't prevent you from having to pay a high fee -- it will just make you wait longer to pay a high fee. It's better just to look at fees in previous blocks.",2015-09-18 03:29:22+00:00,cv5hx04,1,t3_3ldzll,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I say bitcoins, but I'm talking about the tech, whether it be a side-chain or alt-coin as necessary.

&gt;The ATO (Australian Tax Office) has recently updated their website, and it's pretty good. It got me thinking. 

&gt;Seeing as we're in the digital age, could a country do something like this: 

&gt;1) Every citizen who is registered to vote log into said government voting service. Account is verified in the normal ways (eg drivers license or tax office correspondence). 

&gt;2) Everyone is to provide a btc address. On polling day, everyone is sent 1 satoshi, and that is their vote. 

&gt;3) The receiving addresses are released for candidates, and everyone sends their vote from their address to the candidate of their choice.

&gt;4) votes are tallied, winners declared, etc.

&gt;Of course people can send any coins they want, but the only votes that are counted are those that were sent by the government's address to known voters to known recipients.

&gt;The software would work horribly as it is right now (it's not grandma friendly), but it can be rewritten, so I'm only talking about the idea.",2015-09-18 01:41:06+00:00,cv5e93y,1,t3_3ldmv7,14,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Bitcoin enthusiasts know that blockchain is the best thing on this planet. Unfortunately no one else cares. Try to explain digital currency to uninitiated people, you'll struggle answering a basic question - why bother?

&gt;So, here is the idea. People need a compelling reason to learn new things, and the most powerful reason is the oldest one - money. If people got paid for using Bitcoin - it would have overpowering adoption.

&gt;Letting people to sell stuff for Bitcoins, like selling videos on  [EscrowBytes.com](https://www.escrowbytes.com) , goes in the right direction, but works mostly in those remote parts of the world where bitcoin is able to compete with traditional payment options like credit cards and PayPal.

&gt;It is the competition from traditional payment systems that Bitcoin must overcome. I am not talking about making it 10% cheaper to buy with Bitcoin - that is unrealistic. 
The goal is to use unique digital nature of Bitcoin to compete ""unfairly"" against fiat currency, allowing scenarios where people are paid for actions which would be impossible to verify without cryptography. 

&gt;A simplified example: advertisement. Pay me for reading your ad, making it cryptographically impossible for both of us to cheat - everyone will be happy.

&gt;Yes, yes, I knowâ€¦ But making a revolution is never easyâ€¦

&gt;I think we have passed a point where we needed to charm talented developers and mathematicians with Bitcoin idea. Now we need to save bitcoin enthusiasts from going jobless.

&gt;Things like blockchain or Ethereum are tools. Tools are for professionals. We obviously need them, but without public interest it all goes to waste, or will be locked inside banks and big corporations.

&gt;Don't create another startup that allows some people to do some cryptographical mumbo-jumbo. 
Do something that lets all people directly make real money using Bitcoin and we'll see it flourish.",2015-09-18 01:02:58+00:00,cv5cv7t,1,t3_3ldia4,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hi All,

&gt;Running Windows 8 64-bit, Armory v0.9.32-beta-85959b20d8, Core Bitcoin v0.10.2.

&gt;Armory loads up just fine, and using Process Explorer (Sysinternals tool), I am able to see ArmoryQT.exe as the parent thread with bitcoind.exe as one child thread (which has a conhost.exe child thread) and another child thread for guardian.exe (which also has a conhost.exe child thread)
This is how it looks:


&gt;ArmoryQt.exe


bitcoind.exe (command line: ""C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\daemon\bitcoind.exe"" ""-datadir=F:\Users[USER]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin"")
guardian.exe (command line: .\guardian.exe 7976 8748)



&gt;Now, as soon as I load Armory, the wallet consistency check passes and then it's stuck in ""Initializing Bitcoin Engine"" with no progress at all (just the rotating grey/green wheel) - then about 15 minutes later, I'll notice that the bitcoind.exe process and its child disappear. Guardian.exe is still running though.

&gt;Now, when I disabled Armory from controlling bitcoin, I can load Bitcoin-Qt.exe no problems, it syncs with the blockchain no issues, and Armory will phase in and out of being connected. Which is totally weird....like the rpc connection somehow gets lost and reconnects at random times. But, even when Armory shows it's connected, and Bitcoin-Qt.exe shows that's it's fully synced with the blockchain, it doesn't update any transaction info in Armory at all. Now, I can see in the blockchain that my last few transactions already have 38 confirmations, but Armory still shows that there are 0 confirmations and that the transaction hasn't hit the blockchain yet. Obviously this isn't true.

&gt;So, I turn to y'all for some help and guidance....I've scoured their forums, and I've tried all the suggestions, so I'm turning now to the trusted reddit community for some insight and help.

&gt;Any ideas?! I mean, I could probably just backup my wallet, uninstall both armory and bitcoin, then do a clean install, then wait a month for the blockchain to sync, but I'd prefer to have to avoid this if that's AT ALL possible.

&gt;Also, not sure if this is relevant, but even though the blockchain is synced, shortly before bitcoind.exe goes out of commission (only when run through Armory, bitcoin never crashes when loaded separately) the cpu % for that process spikes to about 45-70% for a few minutes, which sounds like it's processing headers and what not, and then just poops out.

&gt;I have a quad-core AMD A6-3600 - not the BEST but not the worst either....

&gt;Ok, help....please....

  &gt;Nothing will add more value to the bitcoin network more than adding high percent of burn fees. Example 75% of all fees are burned. That is the only change to core that will be approved by all. Its good for minners, good for value, good for wallets and retail. Its very bad for spam, and stress test.

  &gt;I am a resident of NYS and I only buy bitcoin on LBC from a seller in peru. I was asked today if I live in NYS and I clicked no, because it was after I had placed my order and I was afraid I would loose my money if I admitted to being from NYS. So I got my coin and moved it to another wallet, but now what. 

&gt;Can I continue to use the same seller because he is not in NYS or even in the US? Would using tor to access LBC help me in any way or would that raise a red flag? Will I get in trouble for continuing to buy bitcoin from LBC? What are the chances of getting caught buying small personal amounts, less than 5btc? Sorry for all of the questions, but I am pretty confused about the new law. I understand it from a sellers point of view, more confused about happens to the buyer.",2015-09-17 18:52:06+00:00,cv4zg40,1,t3_3lc2q9,4,BitcoinAll

you should consider that this account has a 46K EUR balance. I can't wait that long.
You can't block my money like that. I gave you all the required documents. I still don't understand.

  &gt;La ultima semana pudimos observar como el precio del Bitcoin tuvo un claro y mantenido movimiento a la baja, tocando un piso en los 223 USD, el pasado Martes, en el dÃ­a de la fecha el precio parece estar estabilizÃ¡ndose en el nivel de los 228 USD. Para la prÃ³xima semana podemos esperar que el precio vuelva a los niveles de la semana pasada si es que logra romper la barrera de los 230 USD.

&gt; [https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1132/1*GuH7WGZ-TrvZUYmtMASB1w.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1132/1*GuH7WGZ-TrvZUYmtMASB1w.png) 

&gt;El director legal del Grupo de SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale ha pedido pÃºblicamente el establecimiento de un marco regulatorio para el bitcoin a nivel internacional.

&gt;En un artÃ­culo co-escrito por Dominique Bourrinet, el director legal del banco multinacional frances; y su colega Etienne Mauret, se discuten las consecuencias de la situaciÃ³n jurÃ­dica indeterminada del bitcoin.

&gt;Una versiÃ³n traducida libremente del artÃ­culo dice:

&gt;â€œEn tÃ©rminos de la legislaciÃ³n francesa, que [bitcoin] no entra en ninguna categorÃ­a conocida:. No es ni una moneda de curso legal, ni un medio de pagoâ€Šâ€”â€Šni siquiera una moneda electrÃ³nicaâ€Šâ€”â€Šen el sentido del CÃ³digo Monetario y Financiero. Esta incertidumbre no ha impedido al gobierno francÃ©s establecer un sistema fiscal ad hoc. la cuestiÃ³n de la aplicaciÃ³n del IVA queda por decidir â€œ.

&gt;A pesar de los esfuerzos de las autoridades francesas como â€œloablesâ€, los autores siguen esbozando la necesidad de un marco regulatorio internacional que supervise rÃ¡pidamente este â€œdinero nuevoâ€.

&gt;La plataforma basada en bitcoin, Bitnexo ha sido anunciada como la ganadora conjunta en la final de la competencia latinoamericana del Open Talent BBVA. La start-up, que tiene la intenciÃ³n de facilitar transferencias de dinero internacionales entre Asia y AmÃ©rica Latina, recibirÃ¡ un premio de â‚¬ 30.000 ($ 33.939), asÃ­ como la oportunidad de unirse a un programa de redes de dos semanas en MÃ©xico y Londres. La otra empresa ganadora fue Destacame, una startup chilena que ayuda a las personas a tener acceso al crÃ©dito.Hugo NÃ¡jera, jefe de la banca digital de BBVA Bancomer, comentÃ³ sobre el potencial innovador de las nuevas empresas en la regiÃ³n, diciendo:

&gt;â€œLas startups latinoamericanas han demostrado algunas propuestas realmente innovadoras dentro del FinTech.â€

&gt;El concurso Open Talent BBVA cuenta con nueve nuevas empresas de cifrado y se divide en tres finales regionales. Bitwage, Coinalytics, SnapCard y Voatz comenzaron a competir ayer en Nueva York junto a los start-ups de los EE.UU. y otras partes del mundo. La final tendrÃ¡ lugar hoy. La final europea, que se celebrara en Barcelona, â€‹â€‹donde Everledger, Safello y Vaultoro competirÃ¡n, estÃ¡ programada para el 21 y 22 de septiembre.

&gt;el exchange bitcoin chino BTCChina tiene un nuevo nombre: BTCC .La compaÃ±Ã­a dijo que la decisiÃ³n era parte de un esfuerzo de cambio de marca dirigida a internacionalizar su imagen.

&gt;â€œBitcoin es global, y como nosotros lanzamos mÃ¡s productos y servicios para servir a la audiencia global, necesitÃ¡bamos un nombre mÃ¡s globalâ€, dijo el CEO Bobby Lee, de los cambios. â€œBTCC es ese nombre.â€

&gt;El exchange tambiÃ©n comenzarÃ¡ a utilizar un nuevo logotipo y lanzarÃ¡ una nueva versiÃ³n de su aplicaciÃ³n para mÃ³vilesâ€Šâ€”â€Šactualmente en desarrolloâ€Šâ€”â€Šcomo parte del cambio de marca.

&gt;Nueve grandes bancos de inversiÃ³n, incluyendo JP Morgan Chase y Goldman Sachs se han asociado con el start-up de libro mayor distribuido R3CEV.

&gt;La asociaciÃ³n verÃ¡ esfuerzos de colaboraciÃ³n entre las instituciones que tomaran forma, el trabajo que incluirÃ¡ el desarrollo de normas para el uso de la tecnologÃ­a blockchain dentro de la industria financiera en general.

&gt;El grupo bancario incluye Credit Suisse, State Street, UBS, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, BBVA, Barclays y Royal Bank of Scotland. Muchos en la lista han anunciado previamente esfuerzos independientes para estudiar la tecnologÃ­a blockchain, y los bancos se dice que estÃ¡n invirtiendo dinero en R3 como parte del esfuerzo.

&gt;Los bancos y R3 formarÃ¡n grupos de trabajo como parte del desarrollo de prototipos blockchain y pruebas de concepto. R3 lleva meses trabajando con las instituciones financieras de Wall Street en la tecnologÃ­a, un proceso que incluÃ­a alojamiento de mesas redondas de la industria y ayudar en las investigaciones internas de los bancos.

&gt;El CEO de R3 David Rutter, dijo de la asociaciÃ³n:

&gt;â€œEsta asociaciÃ³n seÃ±ala una importante apuesta por parte de los bancos para evaluar conjuntamente y aplicar esta tecnologÃ­a emergente para el sistema financiero global. Nuestros socios bancarios reconocen la promesa de las tecnologÃ­as del libro mayor distribuido y su potencial para transformar las plataformas tecnolÃ³gicas de los mercados financieros, donde las normas deben ser seguras, escalables y adaptables â€œ.

&gt;Los representantes de los bancos involucrados, dijo que la asociaciÃ³n ayuda a armonizar el desarrollo de la tecnologÃ­a en un intento por promover el trabajo mÃ¡s completo.

&gt;â€œEn este momento, se estÃ¡ viendo dinero y tiempo significativo se gasta en la exploraciÃ³n de estas tecnologÃ­as de manera fracturada que carece de la estratÃ©gica, coordinada visiÃ³n tan crÃ­tica para el Ã©xito a tiempo. El modelo R3 estÃ¡ cambiando el juegoâ€, dijo Kevin Hanley, director del diseÃ±o en el Royal Bank of Scotland.

&gt;La participaciÃ³n de los bancos, de acuerdo con un representante, es un reflejo del creciente interÃ©s entre las grandes instituciones financieras en tecnologÃ­a blockchain.

&gt;â€œEstas nuevas tecnologÃ­as pueden transformar la forma en que se registran las transacciones financieras, reconciliados y reportadasâ€Šâ€”â€Štodo con la seguridad adicional, las tasas de error mÃ¡s bajas y una reducciÃ³n significativa de costosâ€, dijo Hu Liang, vicepresidente senior de State Street y la cabeza de las tecnologÃ­as emergentes.

  &gt;Disturbing title? - Ok, I will explain what I mean, I think after that it gets clear that it is not as crazy as it looks.



&gt;**Appendix**: What would be a most ""fair"" voting &amp; blocks size limit adjustment mechanism? Is BIP-100 a candidate?

&gt;I think BIP-100 can be improved. BIP100 is coarse: It requires 80% majority for even the tiniest block size limit adjustment, but then can achieve adjustment steps as big as 20% per 2-weeks (i.e. multiply by 114 per year) with the same majority.

&gt;Why shouldn't we allow a stable 55% majority to at least increase the block size limit at a rate of 4% per year? (which is WAY below any technological growth curve), for example.

&gt;A generalization of BIP-100 is more reasonable, the exact parameterization of the following proposal is to be debated (BIP-100 being one particular sub-case), but in principle voting should follow this single simple rule:

&gt;**A small majority can adjust the block size limit slightly, a huge majority can adjust the limit by a bigger leap.**

&gt;Illustration:

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt;Concrete example:


&gt;A 55% majority can adjust by 0.1% per 2-weeks (+/-2.6% p.a.)
&gt;A 60% majority can adjust by 0.5% per 2-weeks (+13.8%/-12.2 p.a.)
&gt;A 65% majority can adjust by 1.0% per 2-weeks (+29.5%/-23.0% p.a.)
&gt;A 70% majority can adjust by 1.6% per 2-weeks (+51%/-34% p.a.)
&gt;A 75% majority can adjust by 2.7% per 2-weeks (+100%/-51% p.a.)
&gt;A 80% majority can adjust by 10% per 2-weeks (x11.9/-94% p.a.)
&gt;A 90% majority can adjust by 20% per 2-weeks (x114/-99.7% p.a.)",2015-09-17 17:58:35+00:00,cv4xamr,1,t3_3lbuwf,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I can not even put in word how BIG this would have been. India is country with more than 960 Million mobile phone users. These 7 companies represent more than 85% of these users. This deal would have let people exchange minutes/balance with each other, and the companies would have settled with each other using the bitcoin blockchain. But the expected number of transactions is way too much more than what the blockchain can handle right now. So most of the companies backed out, and are focusing on a centralized solution now. Good job guys! The harm this debate is doing to bitcoin and your holdings is immense. I hope everyone realizes this soon.

  &gt;Apple's newly-released iOS 9 now supports ad blockers.

&gt;Although released only yesterday, already the adblocker apps are now topping the download charts.

&gt;Publishers are facing a 75% loss in ad revenue, so they'll be forced to find new ways to monetise.

&gt;This could catalyse the adoption of Bitcoin for quick and easy micropayments.

&gt;Imagine... with one tap you pay 1 bit to read an article, or 3 bits to read the site for a day. All without having to share your credit card details with a publisher where they might be leaked.

  &gt;Hi folks,

&gt;Yesterday I was sending some coins from my kraken account to my electrum wallet on windows. 

&gt;The transaction shows up on blockchain.info fine and in electrum, the total balance has been updated correctly. 
But on the transaction it shows up as unverified with -1 confirmations. 

&gt;I tried updating to electrum 2.4.4, deleting the header file,  opening the wallet file, trying different servers and restarting it a ton of times but its the same situation. 

&gt;Any tips or tricks would be helpful. 
Thanks in advance. ",2015-09-17 11:59:22+00:00,cv4kutt,1,t3_3lajgh,12,BitcoinAll

  &gt;It's possible to prove you store the UTXO set locally, so I'm wondering if this can be used as a proxy for full node validation.

&gt;In a situation where the protocol provides an economic incentive for users to provide proof of UTXO storage, users could end up storing the UTXO set, but not doing full validation, thus defeating the purpose of the scheme, which is to gauge full node decentralization. The key question is whether most of the cost of validation is borne by someone storing an up-to-date UTXO set locally.

&gt;If it is, most users storing the UTXO set wouldn't object to taking the small additional step of doing full validation.",2015-09-17 10:21:03+00:00,cv4j8ye,1,t3_3lab2h,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Dear Reddit, my name is Gregor Volkmann, I am a german entrepreneur in cinema advertisements and currently planning a crowdfunding for advertising bitcoin in cinemas! I would like to know, what you think about my idea and whether I should start this campaign. 

&gt;**The idea:**

&gt;The idea is simple, but with a special addition. I want to crowdfund screentime for bitcoin in cinemas (I am in cooperation with a bunch of them and able to get very good prices). But just doing cinema advertisements for bitcoin wouldnâ€™t change anything, since we have few stores which accept bitcoin here in germany. Now, with the already funded screentime, I will go to local stores and offer it in exchange for accepting bitcoin.

&gt;Why I want this to happen:


More people will understand bitcoin isnâ€™t just â€œdark web moneyâ€
Getting more connected to the local stores and cinemas
Bitcoin would be usable in the crowdfunded cityÂ°


&gt;**Planned stretch goals:**

&gt;**BTC advertisements in my original hometown LÃ¼denscheid (80k Inhabitants)**

&gt;For at least 8 local stores I will do 6 months of advertising. Before every movie in the cinema our ad will be running. The minimum playtime for the ad will be 30 seconds, every store promotes in about 5 seconds products you can now buy with the easy to use bitcoins from themÂ°. At the end of the ad we will show the animated bitcoin logo and 3 sponsorsÂ° of this crowdfunding.

&gt;Estimated expenses:


400â‚¬        Ad costs (6 Months, 30seconds, big hall)
200â‚¬        [recruit/collect/aquire] and record stores for the ad
200â‚¬        Postproduction
150â‚¬        Bitcoin workshop for stores, cinema and their staff
â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
950â‚¬


&gt;**BTC Advertisements in LÃ¼denscheid &amp; my current hometown Wiesbaden (80k+270k Inhabitants)**

&gt;8 Stores in each LÃ¼denscheid and Wiesbaden. 30 seconds each ad. Also see the above stretch goal.

&gt;Estimated expenses:


~1.000â‚¬ Ad costs Wiesbaden (6 Months, 30seconds, three halls)
200â‚¬        [recruit/collect/aquire] and record stores for the ad
200â‚¬        Postproduction
250â‚¬        Bitcoin workshop for stores, cinema and their staff (location may cost)
1.150â‚¬Luedenscheid (see above + second hall)
â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
2.800â‚¬


&gt;Each planned stretch goal is calculated for minimal effort and no rent for additional equipment, so every excess of the stretch goal to the next one will be used to refine the actual production (more stores, better sound/lighting). Details on my filming gear in the next update.

&gt;**First test run:**

&gt;I already asked local stores here in Wiesbaden, whether they could imagine accepting bitcoins in exchange for getting free advertisements in their local cinemas. Not only have I received acceptance and adoption promises, I also were allowed to film example footage to give the people interested in the crowdfunding a better idea of what I am talking about! Depending on how the reception of my reddit post is, I will put the footage together and share it with you guys.

&gt;Â°more on this in my next update!

  &gt;Bitcoin is flying everywhere in Europe and America but not so in Africa. Fortunately, it is gathering momentum here in Ghana, and Ghanaians are likely to be the number one â€œBitcoin-Nationâ€ in Africa because there are brilliant advocates, though they are few, who are trying their best to ensure that Bitcoin becomes a reliable medium of exchange as far as market is concerned. To expedite this dream into reality, BitUnit Foundation will be organizing a Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology focused seminar in Dansoman- Greater Accra 0n the 28th day of November 2015,  in the City of Ghana. We will introduce Bitcoin and blockchain technology to the attendees. The Bitunit Foundation is determined to educate the masses on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency usage and acceptance to improve their businesses and to help them understand the concepts of blockchain technology.
The event will be categorized into the following stages:
ï¶ Introduction to our newly founded BitUnit Foundation, our mission, vision, long term and short term goals.

  &gt;So often do I see people argue that large miners can do this and that to push out small miners. 

&gt;The problem is that there are two very different forms of size in this discussion! 

&gt;Just because you own several square kilometers of ASIC miners does not make you a big miner in both areas. I could point those miners to a Raspberry PI, and get taken out by a dude with a laptop running CPU mining.

&gt;So please, let's stop it with the argument that a small miner will go in to swap hell or node crash. Just because I don't have petahashes to contribute with, doesn't mean I don't have a kickass internet connection and a really powerful desktop running my node.

  &gt;The Bitpay Chain of Events from Hanover Insurance Group, June 8, 2015

&lt;ol&gt;
&gt;On or before December 11, 2014, the email account of David Bailey was
compromised by an unknown third party. Bitpay was in negotiations with Mr. Bailey, of ybitcoin, to purchase BitPay's magazine business.
&gt;On December 11, 2014, Bitpay, including Bryan Krohn, receives what
appears to be a legitimate email from Mr. Bailey to review modifications to an attached Google document. Mr. Bailey was unaware of this email. Upon Mr. Krohn opening his Google docs account his Google account password and authentication codes were compromised.
&gt;Immediately after clicking on the Google doc link, Mr. Krohn enters his
authenticating information as prompted in order to access the purported Google docs and receives an error message. He believes his private information was stolen at that time and that his response provided access to his email to the fraudster. He also believes that the fraudster at that time was able to review his communications to learn specific details about how Bitpay transacted business, including the fact that Second Market was the sole purchaser ofbitcoins with whom Bitpay did not require advance payment.
&gt;On December 11, 2014 at 2:26PM, an email purporting to be from Mr. Krohn
is sent to Stephen Pair (""the CEO""), which contains a purported email chain between the Mr. Krohn and Mr. Preston Blankenship, of Second Market, which the CEO believes to be authentic. The email requests that 1,000 bitcoins be transferred to Second Market at a specific wallet address provided. At 3:33 PM the bitcoins are sent from Bitpay's hot wallet.
&gt;On December 11, 2014 at 4:23 PM, someone posing as Mr. Krohn sends
another email to the CEO which says, ""just confirmed with Tony [Gallippi], please send Second Market another 1,000 btc to the same address ... ""
&gt;The CEO responds to the second email at 4:29 PM stating, ""I don't have that
many in the hot wallet ... these will draw down the warm wallet.""
&gt;Also at 4:29 PM, in response to the email from the CEO, Mr. Gallippi responds, ""No, I will send from Bitstamp.""
&gt;At 4:30PM, the CEO responds ""ok.""
&gt;At 4:35 PM, Mr. Gallippi states that Bitstamp should be sending shortly, and
apparently Bitstamp consummated the transfer.
&gt;At 9:20AM the next day, the imposter, posing as Mr. Krohn, sends another
email to the CEO stating, ""please send 3000 btc to Second Market"" at a different
Blockchain internet wallet address.
&gt;The CEO then sent an email directly to Mr. Krohn to confirm that this
request, which exceeded the usual 1000-2000 daily bitcoin amount between the companies, was valid.
&gt;The imposter sends an email back to the CEO, with a purported cc to Second
Market, that the 3,000 bitcoin request is valid.
&gt;The CEO sends the 3,000 bitcoins from Bitpay's warm wallet to Second
Market.
&gt;The CEO then sends an email back to Mr. Krohn's address, with a cc to Ms.
Gina Guarnaccia at Second Market, confirming that the bitcoins have been sent. Ms.
Guamaccia responds that she did not send the prior email noting the 3,000 bitcoins and address for them to be sent, and that Second Market did not purchase the bitcoins. As noted in Insuring Agreement 6 cited above, the Policy requires that the loss of money be the direct result of the use of any computer to fraudulently cause a transfer of that property from inside the premises to a person or place outside the premises. ""Direct"" means without any intervening step i.e. without any intruding or diverting factor. The Computer Fraud Insuring Agreement is only triggered by situations where an unauthorized user hacks into or gains unauthorized access into your computer system and uses that access to fraudulently cause a transfer of Money to an outside person or place 
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;The facts as presented do not support a direct loss since there was not a hacking or
unauthorized entry into Bitpay's computer system fraudulently causing a transfer of
Money. Instead, the computer system of David Bailey, Bitpay's business partner, was
compromised resulting in fictitious emails being received by Bitpay. The Policy does not afford coverage for indirect losses caused by a hacking into the computer system of someone other than the insured. 

&gt;Furthermore, there is an important distinction between fraudulently causing a
transfer, as the Policy language requires, and causing a fraudulent transfer, which is what occurred upon the CEO's approval of the bitcoin transactions after receiving the fictitious emails. The loss incurred by Bitpay was not a direct loss. The Insuring Agreement is also not triggered when an authorized system user triggers a transfer, even one induced by fraud. In this case, the transfers were first required to be approved by Bitpay's CEO, who is an authorized user of the system. The fact that the transfer requests were allegedly fraudulent does not, for the reasons explained above, trigger the Computer  Fraud Insuring Agreement.

&gt;In addition, the term ""premises"" is defined in the Policy as, ""the interior of that
portion of any building you occupy in conducting your business"". It is Hanover's
understanding that the bitcoins were held online, and transferred online, and are not on the physical premises of Bitpay. It does not appear that the bitcoin transactions involved a transfer of property from inside the premises to outside the premises. As such, Hanover
must respectfully decline to provide coverage for this loss under the Computer Fraud Insuring Agreement.

&gt;Because the reasons discussed above are dispositive of our coverage analysis, we have not discussed other terms, conditions or limitations of the Policy that might apply to this matter. Our action in this regard is not, and should not be interpreted as, a waiver of any additional rights Hanover may have to decline coverage for this matter. Rather, Hanover reserves all rights available to it under the Policy, at law or in equity.

&gt;Our analysis is also necessarily based on the facts and information made available to us to date.  If you have additional information that would bear on our analysis, please forward it to us immediately. We will gladly review our coverage position in light of any additional information received. Naturally, we reserve the right to raise additional terms and conditions of the Policy, or to assert other rights we may have under the law or in equity, that may become apparent upon review of such additional information. If you have any questions you may contact me weekdays from 7:00a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

  &gt;I wanted to research Electrum and how it works and on the official Electrum site I was directed to their wiki hosted by orain.org and it redirects me to porn hub.

&gt;Someone at Orain is playing a joke? Or hacked?

&gt;Can someone answer my question in the mean time since I cant access the wiki? I want to know how I can input the seed into any computer with Electrum and retrieve my wallet, like how is it possible if Electrum doesn't host your bitcoin wallet? Where does it pull it from?

  &gt;Fellow Pirates,
I've an idea that will change the reinsurance industry and pave way to possibility of an insurance DAO in near future. Reinsurance is simply put insurance of an insurer. When an insurer needs to protect itself from an extreme event like an earthquake or hurricane they buy insurance from an reinsurer. Similarly reinsurer purchases protection from Retrocession which is insurance of reinsurer. Goes without saying that it is a very bureaucratic and specialized market where deals are executed behind closed door and corporate relationship is the linchpin to success. More recently there was a surge of ILS products where hedge funds are using derivatives backed by treasury to execute deals. The ILS markets grew exponentially over the last 5 years and it needs to be noted the regulations in this field is more relaxed than insurance or banking. I've been with the industry for 11 years and located in Bermuda which is a lead jurisdiction for reinsurance. There are a few characteristics which makes reinsurance an ideal candidate for crypto disruption:
1. ILS products are often index based which means an unambiguous claims settlement. However it is rather expensive and too many counterparties/third parties involved (e.g. lawyers, banks, brokers) that increase the cost significantly
2. Regulations are relatively lax and reinsurance have developed mostly in offshore locations
3. Contracts and structures more or less standard across the industry which rarely changes

&gt;My idea would be to take reinsurance to the next level where the reinsurance liabilities can be attached to a crypto coin and traded. DAO can be the final objective, however I know being in the industry that it will take time and further development of a underwriting suite (which will take 1 year atleast) to set up the DAO. 

&gt;I have the contacts within the industry to make this happen, however I need a team with Blockchain and Smart Contract experience to set it up.",2015-09-17 01:58:55+00:00,cv48liz,1,t3_3l90uy,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I'd it possible for bitcoin to remain the settlement layer (the more valuable ""slow money"") while anther crypto such as LTC (backed by BTC) takes the place of smaller transactions?

  &gt;I am posting this under a throwaway account to keep both myself and my source confidential. My source was contacted by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in regards to his activities involving the popular bitcoin trading platform Bitfinex. Attached is the screen shot of the email with sensitive information redacted:  [http://imgur.com/87eML4i](http://imgur.com/87eML4i)  I have checked out the inquiring CFTC official and the CC on the email, both do appear to work at the Chicago office of the CFTC, one as a trial attorney and one as an investigator. I have not gone and inquired beyond an internet search so there might be more digging to check for legitimacy but this is as far as I am comfortable going.

&gt;As far as the reason for the inquiry I do not want to go overboard with speculation and cause undue alarm to the community but I would venture to guess is has to with Bitfinex and their peer-to-peer swap facility. Even under a report by the CFTC from October 2014 they list Bitfinex as offering ""total return swaps"" which would place them under CFTC oversight.  [http://imgur.com/yh2hiJJ](http://imgur.com/yh2hiJJ)  Here is the full source of that pdf as well:  [http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@aboutcftc/documents/file/gmac_100914_bitcoin.pdf](http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@aboutcftc/documents/file/gmac_100914_bitcoin.pdf)

  &gt;Hey guys, I'm new to Bitcoin and trying to get an idea of how much miners cost in terms of power in a region like Southern California.

&gt;For example, how much would this one cost to run, on average?

&gt;SP35 Yukon
 [http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/products/sp35-yukon-power-shipping-from-stock](http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/products/sp35-yukon-power-shipping-from-stock) 

&gt;Is it even worth it to mine at home anymore?

&gt;Thanks.",2015-09-16 23:00:03+00:00,cv42frr,1,t3_3l8e7x,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Guys I just deposited a couple grand on bread wallet. One was for 50 and the other 1950. The 50 one has confirmed 4/5 times and went through. The 1950 one is stuck at ""unverified. Seen by 2 of 3 peers"". It keeps going from that, to verified then back to ""unverified seen by 2 of 3 peers"". 

&gt;Please help? Have I lost my money? What's happening? :(",2015-09-16 22:05:58+00:00,cv40hxw,1,t3_3l8700,14,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hi Everyone, 

&gt;I'm a CS researcher and I may have a use for hashing equipment to put it to new uses. Since BFL gear is plentiful I would like to try to re-use it. 

&gt;With that said I know they are a shitty company and I was one of the first to pre-order way back when. Anyway...

&gt;I know that they have released the source code for the bitforce single 60Ghs miners. Does anyone know if they released source code for the monarchs?",2015-09-16 21:54:47+00:00,cv402w1,1,t3_3l85bv,12,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Like even as a semi-skeptic this is baffling to me.  Like I get apple pay getting millions of users since they have a giant company behind them, but if a new company can just come along and get 500% more users in a year than bitcoin can get in seven years that seems crazy. 

&gt;Like I would understand if the public is afraid of cryptographic keys or blockchains or whatever but bitcoin already has centralized solutions. You can send money on circle or whatever without actually using bitcoin at all. And not even those have even 10% of the user base a random korean company has gotten almost instantly. 

&gt;What is up? What is the real source of this totally terrible adoption curve?

  &gt;I'm looking to run bitcoin core without the 50GB it takes up. My research indicates that there is a pruning option I can access by compiling from source myself. That's a lot of work on Windows and I don't have a linux box set up right now. So, are there any clients which can prune the local storage of the blockchain without having to compile from source?

  &gt;This month, Crypto Capital, together with our integrated bitcoin counterpart, Coinapult, are very proud to announce the integration with renowned mobile bitcoin wallet, Mycelium. 

&gt;The integration gives users access to Coinapultâ€™s convenient value-locking service, Locks, which allows any value of bitcoin to be locked to USD. This provides the user with a quick and simple way to use and hold bitcoin without worrying about bitcoin market volatility. The dollar value of the userâ€™s bitcoin is retained over time, no matter what the market does. 

&gt;Users are able to set up a Coinapult Locks account from directly within the app and from there can simply transfer bitcoin in and out of the account to lock and unlock the desired amount of bitcoin. For example, you could lock $1,000 of bitcoin to USD in October to make sure you have the funds to pay your rent for November. Then when it comes time to pay your rent, you can unlock the $1,000 of bitcoin value in your wallet and pay your rent, even if the price of bitcoin were to fall 50% the day before! Youâ€™re locked! Youâ€™re safe!

&gt;Any bitcoins deposited to the Mycelium-Coinapult wallet are automatically pegged to USD. When you send locked funds out, they are sent as bitcoins and deducted from your current USD balance.

&gt;Watch the demo video of how to use a Coinapult USD account with the Mycelium app  [https://youtu.be/eT2CmOfXyH0](https://youtu.be/eT2CmOfXyH0) ",2015-09-16 19:58:52+00:00,cv3vbi6,1,t3_3l7nxm,17,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Cryptsy is currently not allowing for EUR or CAD withdrawals. The option is there in the website, but when clicking the link all we get is a blank page. No information.

&gt;3 days ago someone complained this was happening in their support portal ( [https://cryptsy.freshdesk.com/support/home](https://cryptsy.freshdesk.com/support/home) ); Yesterday I sent a ticket complaining about the same problem, linking the ticket and oddly enough a few minutes later the freshdesk ticket had been removed.

&gt;My ticket was replied by email today, saying the service is not working and that it's being worked on. No estimate when it would working. This is just marginally better than not saying anything at all.

I did all of this, the app stated it received my order receipt, and I check my status today and it says it's cancelled. No reason whatsoever, and my money is in the mail to them already. Great.

  &gt;From the Australian website  [macrobusiness](http://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2015/09/gotti-rings-warning-bell-on-china-property-bid/)  (see the comments):


&gt;A mate of mine is a real estate agent in Balwyn â€“ the epicentre of Chinese investment in Melbourne property. He tells some interesting stories.
The new restrictions are really having an effect. One Chinese buyer had to go to extraordinary lengths to settle on a property last week. Apparently they used to be able to get lots of people in China to transfer $50k each to a single bank account here in Australia ($50k was the max you could transfer out in 3 or 6 months or something from a Chinese bank account). Now China is also tracking the account receiving the money â€“ the same overseas account cannot receive more than $50k from Chinese accounts. Anyway, the Chinese buyer tried the â€˜oldâ€™ approach and was rung by the Bank of China advising her that the attempted money transfers were illegal. The buyer needed about $2m. What they ended up doing was flying their whole family out (10+ people) to all set up bank accounts here in Australia. The flights would have cost of fortune. Plus they contacted people they knew in Australia to help out. They then used multiple accounts in China to transfer to multiple accounts in Australia, before putting the money into a single account in Australia.
So itâ€™s much harder to get money out â€“ but still possible. Has to stop some buyers, at least.
More generally my mate tells me that expressions of interest are down, there are fewer Chinese turning up to open for inspections, etc â€“ all in the past 2 or so weeks.
Will be interesting to see what happens when the ATO steps up later this year.


&gt;It interests me to consider: does Bitcoin help the person in this case? It doesn't make the transfer any less illegal to the CCP, but let's put that to one side for the moment. 

&gt;Consider that a $2 million dollar (this is AUD not USD so it's actually 30% less but let's pretend it's $2m for simpler numbers) buy would be about 10K BTC. Given that there are multiple fairly big exchanges and a lot of USD and RMB liquidity, I guess you could buy this fairly quickly, but once the market gets wind of such a big buyer the offers will start disappearing rapidly. In other words, you might get a lot of slippage on price and might end up paying a few percent more than the starting price. (Doing a special deal with a miner might make some sense, but that would be seriously hard if not impossible).

&gt;Then consider liquidating into AUD. Much less AUD liquidity of course, but you could liquidate into USD and transfer to an arbitrary international account; after all, a wire transfer fee into Australia is basically zero compared to everything else discussed here. Another problem might crop up there: wire transfers of $2m into a new account could create AML/KYC flags, at the Bitcoin exchange, and at the one or two bank accounts involved.

&gt;Add to that the general volatility risk of the Bitcoin exchange rate; it's more of a risk than a certain cost, but if BTC moves against fiat by more than 5% in all this, it could be quite a big hit.

&gt;Compare all that to the cost of flying 15 people to and from Australia and doing it that way. I would ballpark that at $40K (also huge hassle, which is not so quantifiable), even imagining you can find that many people amongst friends and family that can do this for you.

&gt;Overall? I doubt the person involved even considered Bitcoin, but on balance I think they would still go with the flights approach, because the limitations/costs of it are more certain.

&gt;But, I see scenarios which would skew it more in Bitcoin's favour:


Increased govt. crackdown; if they start checking and investigating more, it's going to be more and more difficult to do it the ""normal"" way. But this could cut both ways; depending on what kind of crackdown we're talking about, Bitcoin might be a lot harder to acquire.
Increased Bitcoin liquidity; Bitcoin's price and daily exchange volume need to be much higher for these kinds of transactions to be doable without worrying about price slippage. That would only leave the volatility concern, which is still larger than normal Forex but is getting smaller.
The obvious: wider ownership/acceptance of Bitcoin always helps incrementally - the buyer already owns BTC, the home seller accepts BTC, you have a friend with BTC already etc. etc.",2015-09-16 07:41:18+00:00,cv3a2e6,1,t3_3l58vd,12,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Ok guys. Country is Ukraine. Theres no one active here any longer since before the revolution. Local currency is shit honestly and fluctuates easily. 

&gt;Only local trader is in small city and nothing here in the capital. Im not Ukrainian, I'm a US citizen, I just work here in Ukraine. 

&gt;Im thinking I can open a bank account in EU country (have one in Poland but cant find company to direct transfer to bank accounts there), purchase bitcoins locally or sell and cash out my bitcoins to whatever country I open the bank account in. 

&gt;Money transfer services are big here but pricing is no joke. For example if someone sent me a monegram from US it would charge them $10-15. For me to send one back to US from here its impossible  (law doesnt allow non citizen to send money) but if I got a local to do it, the price even to send $200 was $65 USD.

&gt;(BTW I did contact the company that previously was open here before the revolution and they stated the demand was there but they had a hard time purchasing bitcoin to here. Im thinking since I can come and go easily to setup bank accounts it should be a problem if I have reliable companies to purchase from.

  &gt;Tech company Code Valley makes the compelling  [claim](http://codevalley.com/whitepaper.pdf)  that the conditions for a software-revolution can be met. They propose shifting developers from the 'code-domain' (current software development practices) to a 'design-domain,' where independent, developer-owned vendors make 'design-contributions,' and show how code simply becomes a by-product of this decentralised collaboration. 

&gt;The 'design-domain' they argue, has the crucial elements necessary for such a revolution (elements the 'code-domain' lacks); strong accountability, feasible specialisation, acute competition, and most importantly, scalable complexity. The incorporation of Bitcoin allows this technology to go global. 

&gt;They envisage a supply-chain spanning the globe, powered by its bitcoin-fuelled vendors, capable of reliably delivering immensely complex software.",2015-09-16 06:12:22+00:00,cv38l3c,1,t3_3l51ee,14,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I have been thinking heavily about how we can implement Bitcoin into the same market place which the two headed monster, PayPal and Ebay, have taken over completely. My reason for this is the continued and steady increased control PayPal has decided to put over it's customers, limiting more accounts than ever before.

&gt;Ok, so scenario. Let's say OpenBazaar really takes off, it becomes a popular trading platform for goods and makes use of Bitcoin. Awesome, we now have a much cheaper and faster alternative to eBay and PayPal. I understand OpenBazaar has a mediation process for disputes on transactions and situations which may be negative to either the seller or the buyer. I understand that these situations may be resolved. However, what can be done in the situations where funds need to be gathered from a party that made a mistake or is directly aiming to make some financial gain through poor ethical choices. How can we protect against actions like that?

&gt;What I am getting from this, is that PayPal does seem to fill that void of protecting the customer if a situation like this does arrive, putting the users account into the negative, or taking any excess funds left in the account to recover what was lost. 

&gt;As Bitcoin is a 'push' transaction, rather than a 'pull', how can we aim to resolve these issues? It seems that the system is asking for a PayPal like system for Bitcoin, a mediator that can hold funds forthwith until a solution is found. 

&gt;I may have missed something recently that offers this solution, but this standard use case, which protects the average, non-techie, consumer from this  type of situation seems to be of the upmost importance. 

&gt;What do you all think?",2015-09-16 02:43:06+00:00,cv33uzw,1,t3_3l4hbf,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Quote from Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast Ep. 170
[43:16]
Back(On BIP101):


&gt;We're also setting up the trajectory, though, right...so, it's not that this is a kind of one-off change; so if we set the trajectory that sees increasing centralization â€” which is kind of the way you presented it â€” I mean, doesn't that end up with PayPal 2.0 in a data center, and you don't need to mine anyway?


&gt;So the claim here is that increasing blocksize means increasing centralization.  This is an unproven claim, which makes his argument a fallacious 'slippery slope'.

&gt;Given  [this data](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3ky04g/initial_sync_argument_as_it_applies_to_bip_101/)  it would seem as though if Nielsen's law upheld to 2020 the bandwith increase would overcome the increases in BIP101.  Has Back provided a solid refutation of projected bandwidth increases?

&gt;Has anyone provided any compelling claims for why bandwidth growth wont increase at rates able to sustain BIP 101 blocksize increases?  Even at only  [30% per annum?](http://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=551) 

&gt;And are decentralist arguments like that even valid in the face of the current state of mining? In my opinion, the mechanics behind miner decentralization have been screwed ever since ASIC technology came out, to the point where now it costs fairly  [big money](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3kywag/gavin_andresen_on_twitter_why_is_mining/)  to get into the game.",2015-09-15 22:53:28+00:00,cv2w39u,1,t3_3l3nq6,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Some episode of party of five had someone pay for rent with cash, when they came back the guy acted like he didn't know them, then when they called the police he just said ""I never saw this guy"" and he just lost his money because he had no way to prove he paid it at all. 

&gt;Bitcoin has the blockchain, But with no registration of who owns what there is no real way to show who paid what. I can be the scam landlord and say ""that wasn't my address, this guy is crazy, pay again"", but I also could be the scam tenant and send bitcoin to my own address then call the police and claim my landlord got the money and then is just pulling the above scam. 

&gt;Is bitcoin just not suitable for person to person payments and needs middlemen the same way cash does to be able to do transactions?",2015-09-15 18:14:22+00:00,cv2l4dv,1,t3_3l2k4l,24,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I am currently looking for a Bitcoin wallet which supports multisig, does not download the entire blockchain and which is ""offline"", I don't want to create an account somewhere.

&gt;The only wallet I found so far is Electrum. The problem is it doesn't work (anymore) on my Linux Mint 17.2 installation (I get a python error which I couldn't fix until now). The version in the Linux Mint repositories works but it does not support multisig. The only alternative I see is Armory but I really don't want to download the entire blockchain. I already tried Copay but it seems that this is just compatible with other copay wallets.

Small blocks will force the development of an additional layer Lightning, that will prey the mining fees from miners and redirect it to Lightning hubs. So in the end miners will get almost nothing. Only if there is always enough capacity in the blocks, Lightning will never gain traction and miners can rake in all those massive fees.

&gt;Is there any reason they wouldn't just immediately set it really low, even below 1mb? Even today, blocks are mined less than 1mb. Miners care more about their bandwidth costs then minuscule transaction fees, so there's no particular reason for them to want large blocks.",2015-09-15 13:54:34+00:00,cv2bdga,1,t3_3l1jgu,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;**Why completely removing the blocksize limit?**

&gt;**System dynamics will lead to ever higher degrees of freedom either within the Bitcoin protocol or outside of it - anyway!**

&gt;Every system has internal and external forces. Much of the blocksize discussion seems to be too focused on the internal forces (scaleability). The communities spinning round since 2010 is just one underlining observation. 

&gt;While a lack of decentralization (determined by infrastructure costs) certainly could kill the current implementation(!) of Bitcoin it won't kill the underlying idea! In such a case, the  community will immediately try hard to make an even better Bitcoin successor.

&gt;**To interfere with Bitcoins growth potential means acting out of fear and is a clear sign of overinvestment!**

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Be it emotionally, mentally or financially.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt;Limiting Bitcoins potential before we know its 'true' impact (which is obviously only possible in retrospect) will interfere directly with the energy put in by most participants and could for better or worse kill the idea (at least for a long time).

&gt;**I don't fear killing Bitcoin in an evolutionary process. I fear not living up to our capabilities!**

&gt;""Bitcoin Core Unlimited"" means giving more power to externalities and therefore trust in dynamically self-organizing processes.

&gt;**Bitcoin is a technical implementation for an economic problem not the other way round.**",2015-09-15 10:30:07+00:00,cv26vzf,1,t3_3l0ypi,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I would like to hear some mind blowing ideas on here that gravitate more towards reasons of how Bitcoin actually help humans.  I myself have been trying to separate the inherent inner beast of rushing to covet scarcity rather than providing an abundance for others.  I ran across a talk where a man pointed out that scarcity could actually be the detriment of humanity and that it is a premiere cause to alot of problems in our society.  Abundance is an often thrown around ideal and I have some reservations on what that actually could become in the future(good or bad).  I do agree that scarcity does breed some inherent superiority complexes in our human psyches and can grow into a poison if unchecked by discipline of our own emotions.  What I am here to ask from the community are any end use cases that provide an enjoyment to life because bitcoin is there as a tool and not just a monetary unit to hoard for some sort of retirement future for yourself.  

&gt;Of course the tool of ""banking the unbanked"" is a great one.  I have no doubt that is plain as day to see and I love that aspect.  However, for the most part all I see is systems being built to provide as much trustless scarcity as possible.  Super cryptographic systems that make sure your digital goods aren't stolen are great no doubt I just wish to hear more about extending good faith and fun use of bitcoin and not ""no one can steal my shit anymore"" mentality.

&gt;Maybe moreso how could bitcoin be played with, if that's even possible.  It is a weird question but just like putting strings on a piece of wood and sounding out something out of pure enjoyment, I wonder if Bitcoin's technology could do the same somehow.  Feel free to input on here any crazy ideas you like, would love to hear it.  Thanks.",2015-09-15 05:53:58+00:00,cv22tws,1,t3_3l0cz2,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;A few months ago I talked about the terrible privacy and security practices by many exchanges in this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/359n3p/plain_text_emails_divulge_financial_transactions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/359n3p/plain_text_emails_divulge_financial_transactions/) 

&gt;Can people help provide an update on any improvements they have seen? (or not seen)

&gt;I am talking about the plain text emails that most exchanges send.

&gt;They include information like:


IP address of login
Country code of your location
Browser/Device type you are using
Amount of BTC deposited, withdrawn, bought, sold
Bitcoin address receiving funds
and/or Fiat currency withdrawn, and name/details of account withdrawn to


&gt;and since this email goes to an email address, all this leaked information is out there for any and all snoopers to gather up....

&gt;This is an incredible security and privacy data breach that is ongoing - and probably illegal in jurisdictions like the EU where there are Data Protection laws.

&gt;TL;DR - exchanges broadcast the details of your financial transactions to all snoopers on the Internet.",2015-09-15 05:33:01+00:00,cv22e6p,1,t3_3l0b32,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Say in some number of years everything works out and bitcoin rivals the visa network and can and does do 56,000 transactions per second. A total success. 

&gt;So every transaction pays a fee of .00001 bitcoin. So .56 bitcoin per second to run the network. On a bubble day that might be a lot, after super gox 11 crashes it's less, but 1 BTC = 1BTC and the fee is .00001 bitcoins, whatever that means at the time. 

&gt;There is 31,536,000 seconds in a year, so that times the fee per second ends up with 17,660,160 bitcoin per year.

&gt;So depending what year it is, that could easily be like 105% of the entire money supply goes to fees each year? How the hell does that work? economically? an economy where each year more money goes to fees than even exists on the planet? ",2015-09-15 04:20:28+00:00,cv20h3a,1,t3_3l03wr,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I'd really like to see p2p decentralized poker, and I don't see any projects that seems to have the correct philosophy for it.  I do wonder though if there isn't a way of playing which doesn't a vastly improved block chain. There are a few ""strange"" assumptions and frames of reference here, but I suspect the general idea is nearly obvious for those that understand LC better than me (which I am still trying to understand).

&gt;**P2P Poker at Lightning Network Speed Without Blockchain Encumbrance**

&gt;There may be a slick way of implementing mental poker via LCâ€™s that does not (necessarily!) need an ultra-fast block-chain. Lighting Channelâ€™s also provide a fault-tolerance required for the implementation of mental pokerâ€™s gameplay. The key to implementing this extension as well as the (justified) assumption here is that each player is securely issued hole cards via mental poker protocol.  These hole cards become part of the secret needed for proof of participation/decision and are also used claim any refunded equity in case of any type of lack of protocol co-operation.

&gt;**One Simple Protocol/Game-rule Change**

&gt;The simple addition to the lightning channel proposal is that anytime there is â€œfunny-businessâ€ or for example if a player drops-out, or wont validate another players move etc, all of the equity in the pot is paid out via the equity in each players hand (in regards to any streets that are or arenâ€™t revealed).  In other words, anytime time players are upset and want a ruling from the floor, the floor always demands all active players reveal their cards, and the pot is divided in relation to the equity each player holds.

&gt;**Poker is Text-Based Turn Play**

&gt;If we think of a poker hand, similar to a complex transaction (ie contract), there is some comparability to text based turn play games.  In fact a poker hand history is exactly that, a .txt.file that can be read by either or both a computer or a human.  The basic point to be made here is that turns can be â€œcrypto-grapically sealedâ€ by the announcement of the next players decision. We can think of this simply as each player upon announcing their decision states â€œbecause you did X, I will now do Y.  So there are really only two decisions we are concerned with: the very decisions to be made and the last decision made before it (ie. the decisions made before these are already verified since the game continued beyond them).

&gt;So if we are on the turn, and no one has contested the flop decisions, we can be sure everything written in the flop history was fair and trust-able for all parties concerned.

&gt;**The House Always Agrees with the Equity**

&gt;This leaves us with a scenario in which a villain, facing an action that is not favorable to them, can drop-out of the game, causing the equity to dump in regards to the hole cards and the board.  If they donâ€™t reveal their cards, they donâ€™t get any equity (which is normal in poker), if they do reveal their cards they get the equity from the last line agree upon and they lose any penalty or reputation they might incur or have.

&gt;**How to Disincentivize Renegers**

&gt;All playerâ€™s still suffer in reputation from the renege, a la having the HH written in the block-chain, but in randomized seating/zoom Poker, habitual renegers are going to have a higher reneg score than those that donâ€™t.",2015-09-15 03:48:17+00:00,cv1zicl,1,t3_3l00b1,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;If I'm trying to stay anonymous (that's the whole point, isn't it?) I'm assuming the best way is to do cash deposit on LBC and go to a bank and put some money in. But I've discovered that if you're depositing into a business account, you have to show ID for anything over $3k. And even if into personal account, the limit is $10k per day. So if I'm trying to get anything higher than that, what should I consider doing? Maybe trying to find someone in person?

  &gt;Hi all!

&gt;I'm interested in helping out the Bitcoin network and have decided to run a Bitcoin node.  It will be on it's own machine that I won't use for anything else nor will I store any private keys on it.

&gt;If possible, I'd like to run it through Tor.  But only if it is safe, as I've read a few things claiming that it is not.  My main questions:

&gt;Are there any security risks for running a Bitcoin node through Tor?

&gt;Will all transactions be able to run through the node, or only those broadcasted through Tor?

&gt;Anything else I should consider?

&gt;I don't know if it's relevant, but I also plan on running a Tor relay (not an exit node) and will be seeding legal torrents, both on their own dedicated machines, but on the same network.",2015-09-15 01:23:34+00:00,cv1u4e0,1,t3_3kzig6,20,BitcoinAll

  &gt;So I'll mention it since nobody else seems to have, apologies if I'm stating the obvious:  [statoshi's mempool](https://statoshi.info/dashboard/db/transactions)  (check out the last 7 days) vs  [tradeblock's mempool](https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/) . I've not found any other good mempool stat sites (hence this post, please share them), so I cranked -maxmempooltx to a stupidly large value on an over-capacity XT node sitting at 50000 transactions and decided to see where it lands (currently approaching 70000).

&gt; [Clearly](https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-block-size?timespan=30days&amp;showDataPoints=false&amp;show_header=true&amp;scale=0&amp;address=)  the 'amplified ddos' spam is capable of filling all the blocks. It also seems that the anti-fragile nature of random transaction rejection by XT is providing a heterogeneous environment capable of persisting valid transactions when an otherwise homogeneous core policy would otherwise be able reject them.

&gt;The timing coincidence of the scaling conference, the spam attack and the XT launch, coupled with its features of larger block cap and random tx dropping is a matter for another day. If something's technically possible we should do it (sooner rather than later to reduce the risk to investors) and find a way to fix the results.

&gt;So have tradeblock changed their mempool policies and if so should the graph have a note to indicate the discontinuity? Is there an issue and is there a plan afoot by core devs to address it (besides larger blocks) and is this part of it? Could anyone completely fill the blocks right now by copying coinwalllet.eu and giving away a few tens of thousands worth of Bitcoin?",2015-09-14 21:43:06+00:00,cv1m82m,1,t3_3kyp71,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;According to this page:  [http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/visa-international-history/](http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/visa-international-history/) 

&gt;Visa was doing 807 transactions per second in 1992. 

&gt;Dividing the average transaction block size by the average number of transactions figures out the average transaction size and then dividing that by 1mb then dividing that out across ten minutes makes a number of around 2.8 transactions per second per megabyte of block space. 

&gt;So a 100x increase in block size would get us to about 1/3rd of the way to the network capacity of the visa network from 1992 and about one half one one percent of the way to the capacity of the visa network in 2015.

&gt;Why is block size even talked about in the context of scaling again? It seems like even jumps of 100x or 1000x or whatever make virtually zero impact. ",2015-09-14 21:32:36+00:00,cv1lty8,1,t3_3kynjg,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I made this post in the comments section in  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin) , but I figured I should post it here too to see what  [/r/bitcoinxt](/r/bitcoinxt)  thinks about this argument.

&gt;I was curious how this ""initial sync"" argument applied to BIP 101, so I plotted it out in a spread sheet. In order to calculate the potential blockchain size, I assumed completely full blocks, which will not likely be the case, so the blockchain size will actually be smaller than what I plot here.

&gt;For bandwidth, I assume a  [12 mbps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds)  (1.5 MB/s) starting point, but ultimately the starting point doesn't really matter. The more important assumption is the growth rate of 50% per year, which is predicted by  [Nielsen's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Nielsen_%28usability_consultant%29#Contributions) .

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Year  Blockchain size (GB) Bandwidth (MB/s)  Initial sync time (s)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt;As you can see, sync times will rise due to BIP 101, but it peaks in 2020, and then starts declining. By 2042, sync time will actually be less than it is now for the average node.

&gt;So, ultimately, I don't think this argument really holds much water. Bitcoin will remain accessible to anyone with a regular Internet connection, even with the most aggressive block size growth proposal.",2015-09-14 18:59:32+00:00,cv1ftmd,1,t3_3ky0dz,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I know it wouldn't be easy, but what if Obama was about to leave office and he decided to replace US fiat dollars with Bitcoin? How early would he have to begin the process, and could he be stopped? He had such a victory with Obama Cares, I feel like this would cement his legacy, and does anyone have thoughts on how we could convince him to enact this? I would certainly be willing to fly to the USA to be part of any ""Million Bitcoiners March"".

  &gt;Could it be that Bitcoin is the weapon the U.S government is using to dethrone the banks power and regain powers?  Could it be that since the banks held the country ransom that the last ditch effort was to release a prototype cash system and leave it open source for thousands to work on to quickly level the banks power to actually restabilize the U.S?  Could it be that using a name like Satoshi Nakamoto would be easy for tech geeks to open their arms and accept an anonymous tech bomb such as bitcoin out of the blue?  Could be it be that all programmers have been secretly hired by the government to further their motives of quickly destroying banks and putting them back in their place?

  &gt;I definitely can't code, but I am very passionate about bitcoin so I wanted to do SOMETHING in the space. I'm heavily involved in the arts for my job, so I decided to gather some local Calgary artists and host a show that will educate both the performers and audience members about bitcoin. The main idea is that every ticket sold will be redeemable for small amounts of bitcoin at the door, which can then be used to tip the artists live onstage. I'll also be live streaming the whole thing.

&gt;This is my first time doing something like this, so I don't know how it will go... but I'm willing to give it a shot. I'm diving in headfirst, and whatever I learn this time around will only help make the next one better.

  &gt;So I wasn't gifted with the technical know-how to code. I don't have very much to offer the bitcoin community in the ways of pushing the technology forward. My day job is teaching kids how to breakdance, and I sing in an acappella group in my free time. I am also ridiculously passionate about bitcoin and how incredible this new technology is. 

&gt;I wanted to do SOMETHING in the Bitcoin space, so I decided to combine my passion for crypto with my passion for the arts. What I've come up with is a series called ""The Bitcoin Sessions"". The first one will be held on Saturday October 3rd at Cafe Blanca in Calgary. The concept is to gather various artists and showcase their talents, while allowing audience members to redeem their tickets for small amounts of bitcoin, which they can then use to tip the artists as they perform live onstage. In between each act there will be people around the room, ready to help audience members set up wallets and learn how to use them. 

&gt;This is all new to me, but I'm willing to give it a shot. I think the best way I can contribute is by introducing new people to bitcoin and getting them curious. I guess I'm going with an Edu-Tainment vibe here. 

&gt;I also hope that some of the bitcoin community will tune into our live stream on October 3rd from Cafe Blanca in Calgary. Any tips as to ways that I can make this event a fun and educational one would be much appreciated. 

&gt;I've gathered a talented bunch of people for the show. You can check them out in this youtube video:

  &gt;A couple months ago there was debate there, and it was clearly obvious that the majority of people wanted something that could easily scale.  Almost everyone realized how insanely small moving to 8MB would be for most modern networks.  

&gt;You read there now and it's just a bunch of small block circle jerking, and people in my opinion destroying the future of bitcoin.

&gt;Like the title says, I almost feel physically sick to my stomach reading it.  I had so much faith that bitcoin was going to be something special, and I probably spent too much time reading and watching videos on the subject.  Every pay check I was buying more bitcoin, because I had faith that when the time came they would raise the limits especially when our computers and networks are at least an order of magnitude better than needed right now.

&gt;When I read the most popular places for people to discuss Bitcoin issues now, it's nothing but people trying to block progress.  

&gt;I used to put most of my fairly substantial investments in crypto-currency into Bitcoin, but for the last month I've been so unsure about the direction of Bitcoin that I can no longer do it.

&gt;I'm already looking at what's going to replace Bitcoin, and putting most of my money there.  I'll continue to hold my Bitcoins because it still has by far the largest market share and network effect, but I've lost faith in the people that are making decisions for Bitcoin right now.

&gt;I really wish Gavin didn't give up his position.  ",2015-09-14 15:51:56+00:00,cv18jcz,1,t3_3kx7q8,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I'm sure that the Bitcoin price will get down in the next months till the next halving, from 230USD/ to 120USD. The reason for that is very simple. 
Bitmaintech will begin to sell in the next 7-15days the new Antminer S7 which uses about the half of electricity comparing to S5.

&gt;The Bitcoin price is based on the miner hardware and how much electricity they use, its clear!",2015-09-14 12:49:31+00:00,cv12pbv,1,t3_3kwk2i,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;This thread is open for discussion on block size and hard forks.

&gt;New submissions regarding block size and hard forks are not permitted at this time, so unless you have very substantial news to share, post your questions and comments here. Please read the following guidelines before proceeding:


&gt;There's a new subreddit guideline in the sidebar. It reads:


&gt;Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.

&gt;Discussing the merits and drawbacks of  [BIP 100](http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf) ,  [BIP 101](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki) ,  [BIP 102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/173/files) , Pieter Wuille's  [BIP ???](https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6)  and other proposals is encouraged.
&gt;Themes regarding hard forks in general, such as what happens when they occur, how to ensure the fork is successful, and how the bitcoin network can react to hard forks which are potentially hostile, are open for discussion.
&gt;Avoid personal attacks and emotionally charged arguments.
&gt;No meta discussion.
&gt;Stay on topic.


&gt;There's been a lot of great discussion so far. Let's avoid falling back into voting cliques. They harm the discussion and will have no impact on the outcome of this debate. 


**Don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.",2015-09-14 11:01:02+00:00,cv10lve,1,t3_3kw913,12,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I've been using Digital Ocean for the last while but the blockchain has expanded in size to a point where I need to spend $80/mo on the proper server with them and that's just too expensive. Where are you guys keeping/indexing your blocks? I've tried housing it under amazon's storage but the connection drops/resets once in awhile causing errors. I would ideally like to keep everything running smoothly with my production server at Digital Ocean..

KNC has boosted their share from 5.4% of the network to almost 10%.
Transaction fee per block is up a huge amount because of the ongoing spam transactions.
Bitminter and Ckpool have had excellent luck over the past 6 months!
For pools that have a public display of every miner, the disparity between the slowest and the fastest half is increasing somewhat (IE there is more miner income inequality now). ",2015-09-14 03:36:35+00:00,cv0so1e,1,t3_3kv6iw,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;If a single entity controlled 51% of the computation of the mining network, this entity could control the block chain with the goal of stealing bitcoin (making a large profit). 
A logical miner will never pay more in electricity than he will receive as payment for mining.  Therefore, the cost to mine a bitcoin will usually be slightly less than what a miner will earn on average in an equilibrium state.
The bitcoin mining ""puzzle"" (encryption problem) automatically adjusts its difficulty to ensure that it takes the same amount of time to solve regardless of the speed of computation.  This implies that if more people are mining, the problem will be more difficult and vice versa. 
Bitcoin is currently going through inflation where new bitcoin are introduced into the economy as miner rewards. Eventually, this will stop and the only reward miners will receive are through transaction fees.  If this decreases the revenue of miners, miners must stop temporarily (negative profit) until the challenge adjusts itself by becoming easier.  The challenge difficulty is a function of the mining profit and the  current computation.  If the challenge becomes too easy (ie. cheap to solve) the network runs the risk of having a party, with the interest of stealing bitcoin, easily take over 51% of the computation.  This attacking party will greatly lose profit as a miner, but since their goal is for system control which has a potential for incredible profits, they will be willing to pay the price. 

&gt;The only resolutions that I can think of to the problem are the following :
1. Have a dynamic block size. The block size will scale to include more transactions such that the transaction fees are always a significant reward. 
2. In addition to a transaction fee, users would pay an ""insurance"" fee to keep reward high, preventing any party from taking control. 
3. Similarly a government could step in and provide a mining population or add regulation to help prevent any party from taking control. 

&gt;Is this a valid concern for bitcoin/cryptocurrencies? Are there any mitigations planned or currently in place to prevent such an outcome?",2015-09-14 02:42:03+00:00,cv0qwqf,1,t3_3kv08q,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I have some ideas! I would like to be able to log into Steam using a form of Bitcoin authentication, perhaps even using physical hardware. This would be good for both me and Valve, for I would be more secure and Valve wouldn't have to store my password on their servers.

&gt;I would also like to see Valve create jobs that pay in Bitcoin for Steam Support. They could create Steam Support jobs from the endless flow of Steam Support tickets. They could hire around the world to answer tickets from around the world. Steam Support would be able to scale properly as Steam grows into the future. 

&gt;How else could Bitcoin help Steam? I wonder if it would simplify or complicate the marketplace if it was introduced, can anyone speculate any possible benefits to bringing it into the marketplace? What about how the IRS classifies Bitcoin as property, would you then be bartering on the marketplace if you use Bitcoin, and would that be an improvement for both the user and Valve?",2015-09-14 02:06:13+00:00,cv0pq6i,1,t3_3kuvwb,10,BitcoinAll

  &gt;So, if all of sudden, say tomorrow, millions of people decide they have to use bitcoin, we'd be in trouble. I don't think the network would cripple even under such huge load, but the standard fee to get a transaction pushed through would be multiple times higher than it is now.

&gt;But what's the big issue? There's an easy solution. The market will simply drive the price lower to account for higher fees. Sure, it may cost .001+ BTC to send a transaction, but when a single BTC is only valued in the double or single digit $, that still comes out to the same USD equivalent as it has been, so no worries.",2015-09-14 02:01:11+00:00,cv0pkc5,1,t3_3kuv96,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;My current belief is that a major bitcoin client update will go out before Christmas with a modest static increase to somewhere between 2mb and 5mb, and within 12 months another system will become popular for fast transactions based on sidechains or sonething.  That other system could be Ethereum but probably people will copy whatever the core team suggests as per deference to their authority.

&gt;So I would say that the most popular bitcoin developers will be selecting the new system based on their actions and statements over the next year.  I believe this system will be built on/settle with bitcoin but will NOT be bitcoin and it will replace bitcoin by 2017 as far as handling the bulk of digital currency transactions (could be multiple competing systems).

  &gt;An another thing I would like to share.
(Again inspired by some post read on  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin) : small blocking are the ""decentralist"" side)

&gt;LN is more centralised than on-chain payment.

&gt;With on-blockchain transactions all the payment information are distributed over the network.
All node are ""symetric""; by running a full node you are maintaining a ledger.
Keeping record of all transactions, you are not evolve any specific payment.

&gt;With LN payment information are going trought specific node.
""Information, data"" is centralised trough specific node; this is where LN get his eficiency.
LN nodes are ""asymetric"" in a sense that node make specific payments possible; they are not ""neutral"".
And not being neutral means taking responsabilities (without your node this money could not have been transfered).

&gt;LN node are not a centralised system as closing one LN would not endanger the network but from the node operator point of view some payment/money transfer are  centralised trought your node and that might come with consequenses. (Regulation)

&gt;This make me think how brillant the blockchain is.

  &gt;And it's this:


the more applications running on the blockchain, the higher the price of a bitcoin gets? 


&gt;In other words:
- is there a direct correlation between the usage of the blockchain to the price of bitcoin?

&gt;As an example which illustrated the question:
- if let's say chain.com will eventually build 10 apps which are all running on the blockchain, will this cause the price of bitcoin to rise?

-managing the miner &amp; pool
-providing all equipment &amp; necessary fans
-payouts on a bimonthly basis (to be discussed)

&gt;I want to know if anybody knows a shop where i can buy a creditcard size smartcard for TOTP 2factor-auth login tokens. Currently i generate these tokens with authy or Google Authenticator on the same device where i do the login and that isn't optimal in my view. The perfect device for my purpose should have softkeys and a display to setup my various 2FA Token-Accounts and obviously show me the generated tokens for a selected account.

&gt;I hope anyone could give me a hint.

  &gt;The mods in this sub have gotten out of control.  The following rules go against the idea of bitcoin:


News articles that do not contain the word ""Bitcoin"" are usually off-topic.  This subreddit is not about general financial news.


&gt;I'd argue the opposite.  Bitcoin can encompass any financial sector or topic if it's used there.  So opportunity for bitcoin (for example, when Paypal stops  providing services to a specific country) are on-topic.  Failings of other currencies are on-topic.  Discussion regarding the merits of different currency implementations (fiat, gold, other cryptos) when discussed in comparison to bitcoin, are on-topic.


Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere.


&gt;If the cryptocurrency provides some thing that people believe bitcoin should incorporate, then it's on topic.  


Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.


&gt;The kicker.  The one that forced me to un-sub.  [Redacted] client is specifically aimed at addressing a problem that many in this community believe is an issue.  Dialogue regarding its merits is definitely on-topic, as it either 

&lt;ol&gt;
 Provides an improvement that people desire or
Represents a threat to bitcoin
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;Either way, it needs to be discussed.

&gt;The point is, moderation should primarily be about promoting discussion and readability.  Things like constant begging, spamming, etc prevent us as redditors from discussing the topic.  These other things are not preventing people from discussing the topic, because they have the topic as part of the discussion.  Until the mods realize that their job is NOT to prevent discussion about things related to the sub's topic, and their job is ONLY to promote readability and accessibility to that end, I can no longer be part of this community.

  &gt;There was a  [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3glfo1/44_of_bitcoin_mining_hash_power_is_currently/)  about miners voting for some issues in Bitcoin network. I come up with some idea:


&gt;Miners create own vanity address starting with 1VIPnnn, where â€œVIPâ€ is Vote for Improvement Proposal and â€œnnn"" is BIP number. If miner wants to vote for say BIP500, he/she publishes block using coinbase address starting with 1VIP5oo
&gt;Pool operators can provide multiple configurations for their users. Someone who prefers for example BIP505 will use configuration (if available) where if he/she finds block, pool operator will use coinbase address starting with 1VIP5o5
&gt;Normal bitcoin owners can vote too by spending some BTC to any coinbase address starting with 1VIPnnnâ€¦


&gt;The results can be published over some period, letâ€™s say 2016 blocks (difficulity change occurs). The order of votes is computed as a sum of incoming BTC for each group of addresses starting with 1VIPnnn.

&gt;Perhaps this proposal should be written and submitted as BIP ;)",2015-09-13 11:56:27+00:00,cuzxikp,1,t3_3krvr0,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I believe the next ""black swan"" event for bitcoin is when the US comes down hard on almost all the exchanges out there which are brazenly flouting the regulations.

&gt;Some common fallacies:

&gt;** Fallacy 1: Exchange is based in [some remote country], so they don't have to worry about US laws. **

&gt;Fact 1. Most people don't realise, it's not sufficient to be based outside of the US to be free of their jurisdiction. If an exchange is serving US citizens they must comply with the regulations, regardless of which country their exchange is based in.

&gt;** Fallacy 2: Exchange XYZ doesn't accept fiat and it's crypto to crypto only. Therefore it doesn't need a money transmission license. **

&gt;Fact 2. Fincen has issued multiple statements very clearly stating that a business which exchanges a virtual currency in exchange for another virtual currency is a money transmitter and thus requires a money transmission licence. Similarly for fiat to crypto. Some sources: ( [http://fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html](http://fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html)   [http://globalcryptonews.com/fincen-ruling-on-cryptocurrency-exchanges-explained-part-1-definition-of-money-transmitter-and-msb/](http://globalcryptonews.com/fincen-ruling-on-cryptocurrency-exchanges-explained-part-1-definition-of-money-transmitter-and-msb/) ). Here fincen publishes a redacted letter to a crypto exchange telling them they are a money transmitter:  [http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/rulings/pdf/FIN-2014-R011.pdf](http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/rulings/pdf/FIN-2014-R011.pdf) 

&gt;** Fallacy 3: Exchange XYZ is a money service business and is therefore compliant **

&gt;Fact 3. It's actually a piece of piss to get registered as a money service business and I wish people wouldn't look at it as a symbol of authenticity. If the exchange doesn't have the money transmission licenses and is serving customers in most states of america it's only a matter of time until they get a knock on the door.

&gt;** Fallacy 4: Most other exchanges aren't compliant so we have safety in numbers. ))

&gt;Fact 4. That is not a robust legal defense.

&gt;Exchanges which aren't compliant and therefore are NOT safe places to leave your money at:

&gt;Bitfinex
Poloniex (particularly high risk since they are based in the US and don't have the licenses)
Bittrex (particularly high risk since they are based in the US and don't have the licenses)
Btc-e (based in a country which may not comply with the US authorities, but still)

&gt;And probably almost all of the others! I've listed the above as they are exchanges which qualify as money transmitters and are operating without the correct licenses. An exchange I am fairly certain has no licenses is:


Bitstamp


&gt;If someone can prove me wrong, let me know. 

&gt;Exchanges that are doing things by the book:


Coinbase
Kraken


&gt;tldr: Use Coinbase or Kraken if you don't want to run the risk of an exchanges funds being seized. ",2015-09-13 11:42:07+00:00,cuzxb57,1,t3_3krumu,5,BitcoinAll

&gt;There's a new subreddit guideline in the sidebar. It reads:


&gt;Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.

&gt;Discussing the merits and drawbacks of  [BIP 100](http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf) ,  [BIP 101](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki) ,  [BIP 102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/173/files) , Pieter Wuille's  [BIP ???](https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6)  and other proposals is encouraged.
&gt;Themes regarding hard forks in general, such as what happens when they occur, how to ensure the fork is successful, and how the bitcoin network can react to hard forks which are potentially hostile, are open for discussion.
&gt;Avoid personal attacks and emotionally charged arguments.
&gt;No meta discussion.
&gt;Stay on topic.


&gt;There's been a lot of great discussion so far. Let's avoid falling back into voting cliques. They harm the discussion and will have no impact on the outcome of this debate. 


**Don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

  &gt;If mining becomes unprofitable for a large group of miners there can be security implications: they could decide to attack the network or sell their equipment cheaply to an attacker. Or try to demand higher fees, which might lead to some unforeseen consequences.

  &gt;I thought this was an interesting experiment, so I tried it: **double-spending the 0-conf coinwallet ""sweeper"" spam**.  Below is a quick write-up:

&gt;You can see the results here:

&gt; [http://coinsecrets.org/](http://coinsecrets.org/) 

&gt;Each transaction marked ""DS"", ""XX"", ""XY"", ""XW"", or ""R"" is a successful double spend.  Here are some recent samples:  [1](https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/tx/fbbc9602f09315048dd1916c7930aae86733201d6476646a0aeda30b535fa628) ,  [2](https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/tx/730a585467dd10cfa6a416d291c6bd83c2771c6d4ede81fb76cdc72216ad6a07) ,  [3](https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/tx/e518aef0c037454c9eda90be460b81ececed232d8436814cbd42dc327aeab76d) , etc.  These double spent some transactions that are days old.

&gt;**Method**:


Intercept a sweeper tx (using a pseudonode).
Replace the original output with an OP_RETURN with value 0.
Resign with the coinwallet private keys (used libcbitcoin for this).
Broadcast the new tx, discard the old tx.


&gt;The original sweeper transaction has done most of the hard work for me.  I merely modify the output(s).  This is possible because the private keys are publicly known.

&gt;By using OP_RETURN, I am sending 100% of the coinwallet ""giveaway"" coins to miner as fees (I'm not getting a single red satoshi out from this).  My motivation is:


Unlike the original, the OP_RETURN does not create a new UTXO, bloating the UTXO set, and needing to be redeemed later (i.e. yet more spam).
My replacement transactions are smaller, have a higher priority, and have a higher fee.  So RBF miners should prefer the replacement over the original transactions.
My transactions merely replace the original, and therefore do not increase node mempool usage.


&gt;Note that most of the transactions that are been double spent were generated days ago.

&gt;**Results &amp; Analysis**:

&gt;Success!  In principle this kind of double spending should be difficult for two reasons: (1) the network should not propagate the double spends, and (2) miners should ignore the double spends.  However, it seems this method is very effective:


The transactions seem to propagate OK.  I guess it is because of the number of XT nodes that propagate double spends by design?
It seems like some big miners, e.g. AntPool, BitFury, GHash.IO, 21 Inc., Slush, will happily mine the new transactions with the higher fee.  I guess they are implementing some form of  [/u/petertodd](/u/petertodd)  's RBF patch?


&gt;I think however the miner's themselves should get organised to sweep the transactions directly.  This will help discourage a flood of  transactions being generated for this kind of event.  I think F2Pool has done this to some extent.",2015-09-13 04:44:04+00:00,cuzqma0,1,t3_3kqzc3,10,BitcoinAll

  &gt;So I had been just following the MacD on the daily. It ensures I get out of a major dump before things really hurt, and that I get onboard a for a bubble before it leaves me in the dust... but overall, I haven't been able to make much coin, especially for this mostly sideways market of 2015.

&gt;I just got a roommate who is big into sports and sports betting. He knows the players, the coaches, and all the stats to an impressive extent. 

&gt;Assuming you know all these things, The quality of a sports team is more objective, and the outcome of a game more predictable, especially considering how manipulated the BTC price can be. Even if there were no wales in the watter, its things like  [this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/3509/products/buy_sell_grande.jpg?v=1426516607)  that often moves the price.

&gt;Allot of people bet on sports for without having half the knowledge my roomate does, so he is usually able to beat the odds.
Im thinking of just following his bets. Perhaps test it out for a month with .1 BTC since you can bet with as little as .0001 btc.

&gt;Does anyone here bet sports with bitcoin? If so, what sites do you most like? How has been your experience with the industry? How reputable are these sites in following through with payout? Security?

&gt;I found  [this site](http://gamblingwithbitcoin.com/bitcoin-sportsbook/) , but often those ""review"" sites are just shilling for affilates.",2015-09-13 04:03:11+00:00,cuzpl3f,1,t3_3kqvf9,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hi, 
I am no expert when it comes to building websites so not sure how difficult or straightforward this would be? Basically i would just like a small window which is a live feed showing all donations to a charity i have been working on in real time. This would ideally be compatible with numerous addresses and just show the amount in btc and transaction ID as a link. We plan to label all our outgoing transactions for transparency but it would be great if we could integrate this into the homepage so supporters can see exactly what's going in and out of the organization. 
If anyone can help with this or point me in the right direction i'd be much appreciated.

  &gt;My bitreserve.org id is marcusyh.

&gt;I've sent 1,896.30$ to bitreseve.org at 2015-08-25, and withdrew 986.24$ the second day. The bitreserve website asks identity information before withdrawing the remaining 910.06 USD. I've submitted my ID photo and a recently face phone, id did not work. I've tried several times, it still did not work.

&gt;So, I've opened a ticket for help. Byrne Reese, the bitreserve.org customer support specialist, responded my tickets for 6 times, from Aug 27th to now, but the problem is still not resolved. He told me to bear and wait, and wait, without schedule or time line.

&gt;It seems that Mr Reese has enough time to browsing reddit to comment to the posts related to bitreserve, but the stuffs at bitreserve don't have enough time to solve my problem, so, I'll reopen the ticket here, and show the ticket progress to the public. 

&gt;I've already submitted a post about it several days before,  but sorry for my poor English, it turns to be a joke because I've mistaken wrote ""Oct"" when I want to meaning ""Aug"". Here is the link of that joke:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3k445n/can_not_withdraw_from_bitreserveorg_im_wondering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3k445n/can_not_withdraw_from_bitreserveorg_im_wondering)   Please ignore the previous post and reply on this new one. Thanks.

&gt;I've already pasted the ticket reply here. Everyone you can image how **hard** work the website do for their customer's request even beg.

&gt;**NOTE to bitreserve** I'll try all the motheds to get my money back. If there still no schedule time, I'll spend this post to every forum, everywhere, to let the whole world know it. If that still don't work, i'll submit it to the authority for judgement.  If still not work, I'll turn to the law. I won't stop.

  &gt;My home internet sucks.

&gt;When running utorrent (which I believe is similar to a bitcoin client - they're both p2p), my utorrent client usually shows a download speed of about 70 kB / sec - which I believe translates to:


&gt;70 kB / sec * 60 seconds = 4,200 kB per minute
&gt;4 MB per minute
&gt;so, about 40 MB per ten minutes


&gt;Does this mean that I could also download 40 MB of block chain per 10 minutes, if I'm running a Bitcoin client instead of utorrent?",2015-09-12 22:46:51+00:00,cuzfwy3,1,t3_3kputl,10,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Amount of gold coins in the world: 171,000 tons * 2000 lb/ton *1lb/16oz = 21,000,000 = # of 1 ounce gold coins in the world if you do the math wrong.  I am certain that was the thought process of the bitcoin founders.

  &gt;By ""infrastruture markets"" I mean the following general principles and phenomena:



&gt;In an ""infrastruture markets"" scenario, as long as there are still multiple, ""sufficiently dispersed and distributed"" geographical locations around the world where decent hardware and infrastructure are available (eg, greater bandwidth) - then mining and full nodes **will simply go there**.

&gt;In fact, the following very positive outcome is quite possible:


As governments and companies scramble to maximize their Bitcoin profits, we would probably see â€œinfrastruture marketsâ€ naturally develop (similar to the current Bitcoin mining network, which already has over 500x the raw processing power of all the supercomputers in the world combined) â€“ ie, various geographical locations will naturally tend to upgrade their hardware and infrastructure, as they feel the pressure to compete globally to maximize their Bitcoin profits.


&gt;So, which of the following to options do you favor more?

&gt;(1) Do you want to encourage governments and companies to upgrade their hardware and infrastructure to compete for ""connectivity to the block chain"" in order to maximize their Bitcoin profits?

&gt;OR

&gt;(2) Do you want to encourage users to increase their Bitcoin transaction fees to compete for ""space on the block chain"" in order to be able to send and receive Bitcoin?

&gt;If you favor (1) more (or if you simply believe that ""competition to maximize profits"" is a more-powerful driver of change than ""competition to transact on the ledger"") than you should support any developers who simply release their best code to allow Bitcoin to scale up on whatever hardware and infrastructure which is known or expected to be available (now and in the near future) within a ""reasonably diverse and distributed"" set of geographical locations around the world â€“ regardless of where those geographical locations might be - and then let the inevitable usual ""Bitcoin mining arms race"" handle the rest.

&gt;**TL;DR:**

&gt;**As long as developers continue to release software that can be run using hardware and infrastructure available across a ""reasonably diverse and distributed"" set of geographical locations, then ""infrastruture markets"" will naturally develop as companies and nations compete to maximize their Bitcoin profits â€“ and this will be a major driver to ensure that Bitcoin scales.**

&gt;**This means, we should encourage ""infrastruture markets"" where governments and businesses compete for ""connectivity to the block chain"" by upgrading their their hardware and infrastructure - rather than encouraging ""fee markets"" where users compete for ""space on the block chain"" by upping their Bitcoin transaction fees.**",2015-09-12 21:38:25+00:00,cuzdpn4,1,t3_3kplqy,8,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Please excuse me if any of my understanding of this is incorrect, but I was thinking about this recently:

&gt;Lightning Networks use a series of valid Bitcoin transactions to transfer value between participants, and the security of these is derived from the assurance that either party can, at any time, broadcast these transactions to be settled on the Bitcoin network and (eventually) get their money returned to them after the locktime expires.

&gt;What fee rates are applied to the transactions, and how can a LN user be sure that the fee applied to the transaction will be enough to get it settled on the Bitcoin network at the point in time after the locktime expires?

&gt;If, for example, a 1 satoshi/byte fee rate was used, and Bitcoin network usage spiked so much that nodes mempools were full, and anything with a fee rate of less than 3 satoshi/byte was being rejected... what would happen?",2015-09-12 21:24:53+00:00,cuzd9q7,1,t3_3kpjx5,10,BitcoinAll

In fact  [I bought a few ""ethers"" myself earlier](http://i.imgur.com/D13puLB.png)  (that's what they call them, right?). It's pretty cool. We're excited to expand the reach of that feature more and more.

  &gt;Remember the hype about the Greece bank closing? Everyone thought that the people there will all switch to bitcoin. Some did, many did not. It was concluded that we where not prepared for this.
Catalans can expect that beside the leaders of the main partys getting jailed, and heavy vote manipulation and all the other things that the central government will attack the regional infrastructure and especially the money. The banks, of course, will follow the orders given to them. Then we will have the same situation we had in Greece. Everyone would benefit from using Bitcoin but they don't know about it and they don't have the infrastructure to get it.

&gt;In order to be prepared for an financial and infrastructure war the people of Catalonia should decentralize their infrastructure and become autonomous in their personal situation. This involves using Bitcoin for a financial infrastructure of transactions and the personal autonomy and control of their own money. If we want Bitcoin to succeed we should help them in doing this.",2015-09-12 20:53:11+00:00,cuzc7qy,1,t3_3kpfmp,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;After reading a post on  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  where the small blocking present themself as the decentralist side I got to think what are the incentive to run a full node if bitcoin blockchain is only use a settlement sevice?

&gt;Why would anyone bother with running a full node when it is only accesible trought off chain service or LN?
(Even cheap why would I spend anything to serve coinbase/changetip/circle etc..)

&gt;Why not just use the off chain service or LN instead?

&gt;So isn't small block got the potential to produce an ever more massive drop of full node?",2015-09-12 20:31:15+00:00,cuzbg9f,1,t3_3kpcjd,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;It seems unique to bitcoin that almost every single major service in the bitcoin space is one where a majority of the community agrees is clearly quite bad compared to other existing services, yet years pass and users seem to rarely or never shift. People start using the word ""goxed"" in 2011 but gox remains the biggest exchange until it ends operation, blockchain.info has numerous serious issues all the time but remains the most popular block explorer. It seems to go on and on in a way that I don't see in other industries, in other industries maybe the big guy can make a mistake or two and not lose their entire business, but I can barely think of examples where the top guy is just consistently the worst of the alternatives for years and years with no realistic chance of losing their position for no apparent reason Let alone an industry where that seems to be the standard where almost every single service serving the industry is some weird 'well, this is the worst possible implementation but we will all collectively stick with this one for years and years, a better exchange/wallet/block explorer/forum would be nice but welp, we already got this one so we are stuck""",2015-09-12 19:41:40+00:00,cuz9rce,1,t3_3kp5dl,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Satoshi did anticipate centralized miners running most nodes, with users running SPV clients. It shouldn't matter, Satoshi is not a god, but it seems to be a commonly misunderstood fact.

&gt;""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe  for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. **Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.**""

  &gt;I'm at the beginning stages of creating a virtual country to demonstrate the power and benefits of crowdsourced/direct democracy in the era of the Interwebs, mobile computing, and Bitcoin. These new technological tools now allow a realistic opportunity for disintermediation of governance (getting rid of the middlemen such as politicians and well-financed money brokers who corrupt our democracy). This disintermediation will start gradually but there's no reason that full disintermediation can't take place eventually since crowds have been shown time and again to be more effective at decisionmaking and forecasting than the so-called experts. (See The Wisdom of the Crowd, Expert Political Judgement, and a ton of other books on this).

&gt;The key idea is to use secure platforms like perhaps Ethereum, with blockchain-based voting systems, to allow for crowdsourcing decisionmaking on just about everything. The first big task will be to create the ""Worldania"" (my working name for this virtual country) constitution, with an entirely crowdsourced-decisionmaking process, of course. I'm a lawyer but not a specialist in constitutional law and nor do I expect people to be specialists in anything in order to take part in creating this virtual country. The end goal of creating Worldania will be to allow for people with an interest in technology-enabled direct democracy to test various ideas and approaches, and over time to see how a virtual country may even become a working operating system for a real country, either through direct adoption or, more likely, emulation.

&gt;At this point, I'm looking for collaborators to flesh out the key concepts, approaches, and tools required for, first, creating a crowdsourced constitution, and then developing the various organs of government in a workable crowdsourced system. People with coding skills are welcomed, as well as those with interest in and knowledge of constitutional law and political theory. 

&gt;My expectation is that the Worldania website will be an attractive portal into a world of free association, free speech, and the ultimate in crowdsourced democracy, with Bitcoin or other alt coins used for any commercial transactions that take place. I need help in creating this website also. I'd like to use the Worldania website as the portal into the blockchain-based crowdsourced constitutional convention.

  &gt;Hi out there.
First: bitcoin is a good idea, I like it a lot and I used it some months ago on a daily basis. But sometimes life hits you hard and you're about to lose everything.
So, why I'm here? I'm not here to tell you a long story how hard and painful life, especially my own, can be. We all know and see it daily on the news. But I'm here to kindly ask for some support. I know some rich people are reading reddit regularly, and by ""rich"" I mean all those people who can by food if they're hungry, get some new clothes when needed and can afford going on vacation. And, of course, there are the ""real rich"" people with some millions on their bank accounts. And, to be honest, we all want to be kinda ""real rich"". But I'd be happy if I could get up tomorrow and don't have to think about all the problems I will face during the day.
So I just fired up coinbase and made an account. It would be great, I mean, fu*king awesome, if one of the ""rich"" or ""real rich"" people would drop me some coins: 142hqgRRvgiZRkv1RJjQ7kzYxCpxEqSWoJ
Thanks for all your support out there!
EDIT: you don't have to comment once you sent some coins. It shouldn't be another ""I gave away again x-hundred coins"" or ""Your life, your struggles. Deal with it"" thread. I know I made mistakes and there are some things I won't do again, so yeah, it IS my fault, but I really need some financial help right now.",2015-09-12 17:29:43+00:00,cuz56hr,1,t3_3konbz,8,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hello Bitcoiners!

&gt;I love solving puzzles and winning bitcoin prizes.  Bitcoin is the perfect prize for this type of competition.  You can't ""sweep"" fiat currency out of the internet before your competition beats you to it, but you can with bitcoin!

&gt;There have been a lot of other people that have created bitcoin puzzle related games and websites, but it seems that they usually die off pretty quickly.  I think one of the reasons is that they aren't sustainable -- the owner/creator ends up running out of extra money to give away :)

&gt;I am considering creating a regular ""puzzle book"" that would include several puzzles with bitcoin prizes attached.  I am thinking about selling this puzzle book for a small fee (maybe 0.01 BTC), but each person that bought the puzzle book would have the opportunity to win bitcoin prizes if they can solve the puzzles quicker than the other people that bought the book.

&gt;I want your feedback:


What ratio of fee to total prize would be good?
How could I distribute this book to the buyers, so that everyone gets it at the same time (to have a fair chance at winning)?
Would you be interested in something like this?
Any other thoughts on format, puzzles, anything else? 


&gt;Here is a sample of what I'm thinking -- a couple prizes are included:

  &gt;I am not sure of this but can the total holdings of someones bitcoins held on their node be seen by the network as specifically relating to that node?

&gt;Reason being if this is possible it could open up a potential new voting mechanism for consensus. For you will be able to see at a glance the percentage of bitcoin holdings that are voting for a certain BIP as opposed to another. 

&gt;This is important because we know nodes can easily be duplicated but holdings cannot and they demonstrate a persons investment and interest. Users and business's with large holdings can then instantly begin to have a vote directly proportional to their investment in bitcoin no matter how large or small their holdings. 

&gt;This could prevent a scenario where just miners seemingly have a vote if you were able to see data that shows a large portion of bitcoin supply is voting for another bip or no bip at all. ",2015-09-12 12:47:27+00:00,cuyxadr,1,t3_3knpni,4,BitcoinAll

&gt;New submissions regarding block size and hard forks are not permitted at this time, so unless you have very substantial news to share, post your questions and comments here. Please read the following guidelines before proceeding:


&gt;There's a new subreddit guideline in the sidebar. It reads:


&gt;Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.

&gt;Discussing the merits and drawbacks of  [BIP 100](http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf) ,  [BIP 101](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki) ,  [BIP 102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/173/files) , Pieter Wuille's  [BIP ???](https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6)  and other proposals is encouraged.
&gt;Themes regarding hard forks in general, such as what happens when they occur, how to ensure the fork is successful, and how the bitcoin network can react to hard forks which are potentially hostile, are open for discussion.
&gt;Avoid personal attacks and emotionally charged arguments.
&gt;No meta discussion.

&gt;I am a postgraduate student researching the adoption of virtual currencies.

&gt;I have compiled a short survey for forum members at the following link:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RedditForum
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt;This questionnaire is conducted purely for academic purposes, answers are in complete confidence, and no personal information will be published, or be used for any other purpose.

&gt;After the survey is completed you will be able to view the results.

&gt;(The survey is also on the Bitcoin Forum, and a member there suggested I post the survey here also.)

&gt;Thank you for participating in this educational survey on virtual currencies. Your feedback is very important for my research.

  &gt;Hey guys, I noticed that most of my bitcoin gambling was done on my mobile (when i won 5 btc from a 3mbtc slots spin on the bus the girl next to me thought i was crazy haha).

&gt;I had troubles finding services that specifically worked on android (native app or otherwise).

&gt;So i've created a subreddit dedicated to all things bitcoin gambling on android smartphones/tablets. You can get there at  [/r/androidbitcoin](/r/androidbitcoin) 

&gt;If anyone wants to subscribe and help contribute that would be great. If there is anyone established in the community that would like to help moderate please get in contact with me =)

  &gt;Hi,

&gt;I installed some new corsair sp120 pwm fans because the stock ones were so brutally loud. Is there any way to increase the fan speed on them? Right now it's hashing away at underclocked speeds and the temps are 55 degrees (fans are completely silent).

&gt;What's a safe temp to be around? If i overclock it will it automatically increase the fan speed, or is there some way to manually set a fan curve?

&gt;Thanks alot guys. ",2015-09-12 04:16:50+00:00,cuypc56,1,t3_3kmov0,8,BitcoinAll

  &gt;We wanted to pay Reddit for a self-serve ad promoting our EscrowBytes service where users can sell their newsworthy videos for Bitcoins. We thought this would be more like an educational tool explaining to ordinary people power and freedom of Bitcoin. 

&gt;So naturally we wanted to target random Reddit visitors - those who did not previously see Bitcoin as something practically useful. 

&gt;Apparently this is not allowed on Reddit. 
The ad was rejected with the note ""Bitcoin related content must target cryptocurrency subreddit"", and a link to the Prohibited Ads page  [https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203677179-Prohibited-Ads](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203677179-Prohibited-Ads) 

&gt;Which means that any mentioning of Bitcoins must remain in the designated reservation without any exposure to uninitiated public. 

&gt;Though I respect Reddit team's conviction - they even refused to take the money - I still find it strange. What did Bitcoin do to Reddit to cause such animosity?",2015-09-11 21:25:19+00:00,cuydazc,1,t3_3klcyd,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;So my knowledge is limited on the value of bitcoin and how the price is determined. I understand that when the price goes down on exchanges it means more people are selling, and when it goes up more people are buying. However, I am curious as to how many bitcoins are active across all the current exchanges and if ""lost/dead"" coins is factored into the price.

&gt;So lets say for example all of satoshis coins started moving around, I personally would think the price is about to drop. However, the logic in that is that it means those coins are counted as dead coins because if the population considers them live the price shouldn't react. 

&gt;Now my next question is the amount of bitcoin on exchanges, I am not sure how many are actively being traded, but let's say it is 10-15% of the bitcoins that are ""live"". So if that means 70ish% are being held then when a big burst of demand is called for (maybe online gambling blows up, or some ETF happens) then wouldn't the price just explode because 1-2 million bitcoins would be just wiped off exchanges within days.

&gt;Let me know what you guys think and other bearish/bullish scenarios you guys can think of that would drastically define the path.",2015-09-11 19:31:32+00:00,cuy9379,1,t3_3kkwc2,9,BitcoinAll

  &gt;It's an interesting bunch. Have just been noticing some trends. The people that stuck around there and didn't defect, they've definitely got a certain mentality. Not just on which client to use. But everything. I'm noticing that they are the arrogant, inactive, futilistic, negative, bored ones of the group. 

&gt;Obviously there are exceptions but in general, it's incredible how common sense, and interesting logical ideas just get shot down en masse by the tenant people there. 

&gt;I've always been a fan of sociology and human group behaviors, and this is really interesting to me. I kind of wondered what types of folks would stay and which ones would go. I'm still trying to figure out how to describe the people who stayed there. 

&gt;Maybe this is a bad example, but I posted a thread suggesting we have one really well-organized Bitcoin conference once a year for bitcoin. Something major such as in Vegas where all the people in the community could come together to network, celebrate, and grow the ecosystem. 

&gt;I got nothing but pointless idiotic responses like ""Why does it have to be in the USA"" ...and... ""That defeats the purpose of decentralization""...and...""We need, or you want?""...followed by... ""This guy is obviously 15"". And then there was the ""Who is going to run it,  the Bitcoin CEO?""  

&gt;I felt like not a single response was either intelligent, nor helpful.  Just a bunch of people trying way too hard to be negative for no reason. Maybe I would get there same response here, but it just seem to match the troll-ish dick attitude everyone there leftover there seems to have.",2015-09-11 19:20:57+00:00,cuy8r1w,1,t3_3kkuv0,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;The beauty of using bitcoin as the rails is that they have a universal protocol. Money really could become like email with incredibly user friendly front ends. If the big guys (google pay, apple pay, paypal, venmo, etc) all decide to be awesome and play ball (ok, apple probably won't until they are forced to) then we really could have a great interoperable system. OR everyone could race for world domination and we end up with another messaging app war. 

&gt;My dream for all this is to have my spending money stored in my @google wallet and be able to send money to my mom to her @apple wallet or to amazon to their @braintree wallet. These tech companies could replace consumer banking in a decade if they decided not to be dicks about it and make their shit compatible. ",2015-09-11 18:38:56+00:00,cuy77g2,1,t3_3kkoye,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;For everyone supporting XT, presumably you care about zero-conf transactions, and will prefer thant zero-conf remain reasonably useful and reliable (constrained by inherent weaknesses of zero-conf, of course). 

&gt;Consider the following scenarios in the event of a spam attack:

&gt;**If each node drops random tx below a certain threshold from its mempool**

&gt;Regardless of whether you tx is ""low-priority"", your tx is almost guaranteed to still live somewhere on the network, in the mempool of some machine. In other words, you still have a pretty good chance of eventually finding a miner (in fact, it's almost certain) to mine it. As long as your tx lives somewhere on the network, and have a reasonable path to a miner, it can be confirmed. The only drawback is that mempools will be de-synchronized across nodes; with double-spend relay in XT aiding route-finding and double-spend alert, merchants with better-equipped nodes should not worry about mempool desynchorinizing too much.

&gt;In order to drop your tx from the network, the spam attacker will need to saturate the combined mempool of the entire network to failure (dropping so many tx, that your tx can't be routed to miners anymore). That is a lot harder than saturating individual mempools.

&gt;**If each node drops tx, lowest fee first, in a deterministic way** (the Peter Todd /  [small-blockistan preferred way](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3kenp1/stress_test_commence_as_of_now_were_seeing_23/cuwxvbz) , they're actively working on it!)

&gt;Think about what they told you when they said they wanted a ""fee market"", where your wallet scans the previous blocks and determine the lowest fee you should pay to still get away with getting confirmed the next few blocks. 

&gt;All fine and dandy, right? That's how free market should compete for blockspace, right? 

&gt;Except not, because when a spam attack comes in, it'll be completely broken. It's not even ""not confirmed for a long time"" anymore, your tx will be dead. 

&gt;The reason: If your tx is at the bottom of the priority list during relatively lax times, you're likely to be paying a low fee - and for good reason, since you have no reason to pay any higher. It's completely rational. As of right now, if a spam attack happens, and they pay higher fee than you do, your tx will be pushed to the back of the queue... but not dropped. Eventually it gets confirmed. Some nodes might fail due to bloated mempool, but the sanctity of your tx is preserved.

&gt;But if the sort-by-fee-then-drop ""feature"" is implemented across all nodes, your tx will die. Disappear. Vanish. Cease to exist. One second your tx is sitting there, 0-conf, with ""expected to confirm next block"", and five minutes later it no longer exists, simultaneously, across all nodes as far as you can see. Merchant is fucked. You're embarrassed. 0-conf is killed. 

&gt;Which aligns perfectly with the full-RBF mentality of Peter Todd: ""0-conf is not safe anyway, kill it with fire, user should be vigilantly monitoring the network all the time themselves and resubmit if tx fails - never mind the complications of not knowing if tx is truly dropped across all nodes, or a miner might be secretly holding it.""

&gt;**If you care even a little bit about zero-conf, the Core drop-lowest-fee idea is so bad, you should consider buying a flamethrower and set all supporting devs on fire.**",2015-09-11 18:27:12+00:00,cuy6qqo,1,t3_3kkn80,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hoping someone can help me who's used ChangeTip to purchase bitcoins with a US credit card?

&gt;I've added their price for purchasing 1 bitcoin via a credit card (including fees) and just wanted to make sure the price matches with what's presented on their website.

&gt;If someone could do a dummy buy and compare it that would be most appreciated :) I can't test this as i'm in the UK and it's US credit cards only :(

&gt;To find the ChangeTip price on  [BittyBot](http://bittybot.co/us/)  use the search box in the buy bitcoins section as it's quite a way down on the list. Many thanks!",2015-09-11 17:45:24+00:00,cuy53ri,1,t3_3kkgyq,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I have an issue signing a transaction from a 2/3 multisig address.
- I construct the transaction using coinb.in
- I sign with the first private key. When I decode the hex output, it correctly shows the transation with 1 signature
- When I sign with the second private key, it does not give an error but when I decode the hex output of that, it still shows only 1 signature and I cannot broadcast the transactions either

&gt;I am sure both private keys are correct, when I reverse the order I get the same issue (first key always works). I allowed for a tx fee of 0.0005.",2015-09-11 17:24:40+00:00,cuy4afv,1,t3_3kkdwc,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Example: Keeping buying bitcoins, increasing demand, thereby raising price. Keep on buying, then eventually the price is much higher than initial purchase price. Start selling at a higher price.

  &gt;You should read this article if you don't want to wake up and find you are broke. I am a legitimate longest running Bitcoin ATM operator in Hong Kong (  [http://hkbitcoinatm.com](http://hkbitcoinatm.com)  ). I have been scammed and my money is frozen with Hong Kong HSBC. I keep minimum cash in HSBC and my money are diversified in different banks, assets, currencies and of course Bitcoin. So don't be the next victim.

&gt;On 18th August I found my bank account frozen. After many calls to HSBC, I am told a person had wired money into my bank account and then wanting to cancel the transactions. These transactions turn out to be a Bitcoin client who started contacting me on 20 May 2015 and told me she has trouble going to my ATM shop and asked if she could wire transfer into my bank account to buy Bitcoin. The client showed me a  [photocopy of her passport](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_X-tufSMQKpT2Y4SjM0N2NSbDA/view?usp=sharing) . I had also asked her what is her reason for buying Bitcoin. She told me she wanted to buy on Ctrip and from website that only accept Bitcoin. I did KYC even though the sum is not big i.e. around 15,000 HKD.  On 24 July 2015 she wired me money into my bank account and I sent her Bitcoin which can be proved on Blockchain. 

&gt;I sent these information to HSBC and they suggest me to contact the customer and sort out the transfer cancel, maybe if I give her back the money back then my account can be unfrozen. However I have already sent Bitcoin to her. When I try to contact her on Facebook she cancelled her Facebook account. Now I have no way to contact this person. HSBC told me to go to the police, promise that HSBC have a department which cannot be named have very close tie with the police and will sort it out. So I dial 999 and the police show up very quickly and drop down some minor information. When asks the police when they will follow up to gather the other information, soon was the reply. Not hearing from them for a couple of days and HSBC seem to be stuck in the red tape I went to the police station. There they told me they won't investigate and had noted down information for record only because no crime was ever committed. So the money sender never report to the police and HSBC has procedure to protect the scammer, freeze my bank account and assist the scammer. I also read online that HSBC had in the past reversed transactions without authorisations and kept account frozen for over six months. While HSBC kept repeating the same thing no matter what I ask them and insist I talk to the police. So at the station I put the police on the phone with HSBC directly. For 15 minutes, I can hear they are trying to push the responsibility over to the other's side. The police ask HSBC how long my bank account will be frozen if the sender of the money never show up. The police says HSBC did not reply. Just saying a special department is working on it but we cannot know the name of the department nor contact them.

&gt;This is week three and I don't know how long I have to wait. I don't understand how a bank or any company can keep your money based on internal procedures and there is nothing one can do about it. Does this mean, I can setup a company, keep my customers' deposit indefinitely based on my company's internal procedure ?

&gt;I do not see this a Bitcoin specific issue because this kind of scam can apply to anyone that accept wire transfer. In fact anyone can have their account frozen if someone know your bank account number. A malicious person can deposit a tiny amount of money into the bank account and then tell the bank to cancel the transfer and have the account frozen. This can apply to Localbitcoins.com, bitcoin exchanges, stock broker's bank account and much more. The source of the problem is the scammer but HSBC has a responsibility for assuming guilty until proven innocent. In my view, they should only freeze a bank account if the police or the court tell them to do so. They are not the judge.

&gt;I have made a complaint to HSBC but they told me they will review it but won't get back to me. So I have no choice but to report to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Fingers crossed.

&gt;So beware, don't take bank transfer. If you not in the Bitcoin business but have money in HSBC move it out. Diversify it. Now more than ever I am strongly believe that your money is unsafe with a bank. They can take your money even in Hong Kong. But nobody cannot take away your Bitcoin.


BTW the above was drafted about two weeks ago and since then I found the scammer.  [His bank account number and company name](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_X-tufSMQKpY2RaMzltSDZDUUU/view?usp=sharing)  were on my bank statement. Will write another article later.

  &gt;Just out of curiosity, is it possible to create a Debit Card which works with all standard POS without the debit card being linked to a central server?

&gt;Is it at all possible to somehow make the debit card decentralized, so it links directly to your personal local wallet on your phone/laptop/desktop/tablet etc?

&gt;So far, all debit cards seem to have a weak point, they are all based on a centralized wallet.

&gt;If this is not possible, can another ""new"" type of card be created which can be 100% decentralised?",2015-09-11 08:58:09+00:00,cuxqh8i,1,t3_3kiqwx,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;A lot of people aren't actually all that aware how Open Source is funded. It breaks down to a few models:


A few volunteers working their spare time (usually only small projects, often not stable)
Sponsorship by a large company (For example redis is sponsored by redislabs and  [a bunch of others](http://redis.io/topics/sponsors) )
Some sort of dual-business model (I.e. software is free, support and hosting is money) (Ubuntu,  [elastic search](http://elastic.co) , Discourse)


&gt;We need to decentralize the effort put into Bitcoin, and that means finding methods of sponsorship that's isn't exclusively corporate.

&lt;h3&gt;What am I doing to fix this?&lt;/h3&gt;

&gt;My goal is to set up a direct funding model where people can sponsor developers as possible without going through a foundation. I'm also going to be seeking grants from investors and open source groups to fund development.

&lt;h3&gt;Are you a developer?&lt;/h3&gt;

  &gt;This ""stress test"" has made me realize one thing.

&gt;The balance in your Bitcoin Core wallet is lying.

&gt;I imported all the keys given away by coinwallet.eu.

&gt;Balance is 0.156

&gt;Cannot spend it due to the ""number of inputs"" that make up this 0.156 being ""too large""

&gt;The whole idea of ""inputs"" needs to be abstracted away so a user never has to understand what it is.

&gt;In addition, fees should not reflect number of inputs.

&gt;I understand why fees reflect inputs, I am saying it shouldn't.  I am not saying its an easy problem to solve, I am saying that, in the future, this needs to be fixed.",2015-09-11 08:16:16+00:00,cuxpx2p,1,t3_3kinvf,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;hmm...
if you could halt the transactions for a 30 days
thats nearly 2 sets of diff adjustments
that could plumett the diff
and then 2 weeks you could mine out
all the coin
while everyone else catches up
and then stop the attack
and then be 30 days ahead
everyone syncs up
and u have all the btc for 4 weeks

&gt;so in oct when we hear about something like that
i told u so

&gt;if u wer in the right position
with the right amount of hash power
and running this stress
or just know it exists
and adding to it
u could potentially mine all the bcks from here on out
controlling the fucking network
crazy
last block time is 2mins after the current time
love btc

&gt;how was it solved 2 mins from now
?
ehem
&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; read up

&gt;im serious man
this might be seriously what they are doing
dude if u could pull that off
for $100k
you would mine 25BTC/10min * 6/10min per hr * 24hrs/day * 14days/diffaddjustment
thats 25 * 6 * 24 * 14 = 50400BTC
....
or $11,088,000
assuming each coin is $220

&gt;yeah
thats a $10M fuck u right there
dude
and whose gonna say shit
the govt hates btc
well hell why not then 
anything to shows it sucks and fails is great

&gt;theyll back us

&gt;if i had the resources
i prob woulda thought of this
and been doing it 
plus
if u slow depos/withdraws to nothing
u can fuck every exchange
and control the prices
jack up the price on all major exchanges
and just fuckking go ape shit
everywhere
ud literally destroy btc while making about a billion dollar

&gt;1 billion dolla
a massive worldwide attack
a hydra
multi fronted
across all major exchanges and their prices and all major nodes and relays
ud have to fuck everthing at once
but if u did
ud take down the entire ecosystem and control it
and once u stop
itll all readjust
and ull be ahead of the game
and profit the whole way
jees
this is big

&gt;dude
this is big
dude
idk how the fuck wed be able to pull that off alone
how do we get in on it

&gt;thatd have to be at least 4 ppl
wed need a few ppl
we need a dox specialist
we need a btc bc expert
we need an architect (me)
and we need a pusher
(you)
then we need to go go go
theres no rush
they arent doing this
or wed already see and hear about it
plus im synced
u r?!
they are just stress testing
but they are showing
its possible
and IF someone was willing to
they could control tx fees
and fuck shit up
and if we built on that
we could fuck the entire thing
and control the price and pull the ultimate p&amp;d
thats where ud come in
as a pusher
ud need to get a few whales
that go along that we give private and preferred access to the real chain
while we are doing this
so theyd be able to push the volumes
and profit
while we ride it
and create it
i mean $10M/4ppl = $2.5m

&gt;that'd be a whale of tale
be so worth t
theyd make a fortune but wed make a bigger one
bc wed be 1 step ahead of them
and nobody'd be the wiser
they just have the boulder to push off the mountain when we say go

&gt;we have everything else set after that
wed make a fucking killing
wed pull $10m from miners
$50M from each exchange * 5 exchanges
$250M
and then cash
thats over $252.5M each
and we walk away
walk away clean
hahha
pretty much
u didnt actually do anything illegal
u didnt hack anyone
but wat kind of hashing power needed
u ddnt break into anyting
i have to research more
its just a thought atm
im just planning the biggest btc haul we could fathom
1 run in/out
that and to what extent could the diff drop
to
and be done for life
thats not the power
thats $10m
its not about controlling the mining
we could not get that
and still use this
its the control of the flow of btc
think about it
if u raise the price of btc on an exchange
by buying it from yourself
and raising prices
pumping
someones gonna depo
and flush u out
but what if u can stop them
they cant depo
then what
other exchanges see it
and rush
then u move there
and allow ppl back on the old exchange
sell all on the new one
ppl buy on old
and sell on new
normalize
u get out
prices stablize
most ppl ddos the servers
to do this now
we saw this with cryptsy
but thats technically illegal
if we were to just control the tx fees
we could inject in enough to control all that
thats what they are saying
you can force offline some depos
and control the flow of txs be processed
so yours go through by paying more
while others dont
their solution xt is increase block size
so it costs more to do this attack
but then it just raises it from $50k to $100k
its still worth its weight in gold at $250M/each",2015-09-11 07:40:19+00:00,cuxpeid,1,t3_3kil0n,12,BitcoinAll

  &gt;What are some things that can only be done with bitcoin. For example

&gt;-Micropayment or tiny donations online. Credit card companies dont like processing small payments, fees end up higher than the actual amount you'd want to send.

&gt;-A decentralized marketplace (open bazzar) or even a dark-net marketplace (silkroad) 

&gt;-Smart Contracts = You could set up a betting system, where any number of people could pay into a contract, and it will automatically pay out to the winner(s), when the result is published on a trusted news site. No middle man required. (auger)

&gt;Eventually they will be replaced. Eventually there will be flawed people in control of Bitcoin Core. Those flawed people will eventually cause problems, whether through ineptitude, maliciousness, or both. Eventually Bitcoin Core will be compromised.

  &gt;Okay so I just got bitcoins sent to an address. The address was a cold address and I didn't save the private key. I have access to the wallet that created the address though - but not the private key. It was my first time doing this and I kept sending the seller the QR code instead of the bitcoin address, so when I finally had that wallet address (which I believe was created as a cold storage address) I sent it to him straight away as I thought he might bail on the sale.

&gt;I know this is dumb as shit and I feel so damn stupid, but if anyone could assist I would greatly appreciate it.

  &gt;The philosophy of **BIP-100** is to be by default conservative on Bitcoin system changes and hence on block size limit changes. The ""conservative default"" is defined as ""no change of block size limit"". Only a huge majority of 80% miner votes can realize changes, while a ~21% minority can inhibit any block size change and prevent Bitcoin from scaling with natural growth of internet bandwidth, CPU power, storage capacities and Bitcoin user demand. This is considered undesirable and also stands against the original design intentions of BIP-100, which is to preserve current Bitcoin characteristics against too easy changes. But when block size limit is preserved while Bitcoin traffic and user demand increases, TX fees would increase and entail huge changes in user experience, while Bitcoin could not participate with the advances in internet bandwidth, CPU power and storage technologies.

&gt;The  [following **modification proposal to BIP-100**](https://github.com/1MichaS1/bip100/blob/master/bip-0100plus.mediawiki)  considers that being ""conservative"" on block size limit means a moderate increase schedule in best (and possibly a bit conservative) anticipation of technological progress ( [Nielsen's law](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth) ) and natural growth in Bitcoin adoption. Defining such moderate growth momentum as the default for the block size limit is considered more ""conservative"" to the actual characteristics of Bitcoin than BIP-100's ""no growth at all"" default schedule. Only a significant majority of miner votes shall be able to enforce deviations from this moderate default growth rate.

&gt;This proposal allows flexible adaptations to unforeseeable developments in technology and Bitcoin user adoption, just like BIP-100, and unlike BIP-101 with its fixed growth schedule. But it has a built-in ""default-growth-momentum"" similar to BIP-101, as opposed to BIP-100 whose default stagnation can only be ""unlocked"" by a huge 80% miner majority.

&gt;This proposal is no more complicated to implement than the original BIP-100. It allows slight deviations from the default-growth-schedule by 60% miner vote majority, and requires 80% for more disruptive deviations from the default schedule.

&gt;Unlike mechanisms with auto-blocksizelimit-adaptations based on actual block size, this proposal (like BIP100 or BIP101) does not suffer the "" [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) "" problem.

&gt;The following modifications to BIP-100 are proposed:


&gt;80% miner vote majority can cause a max. adjustment step of +/-10% (not +/-20% like BIP-100), i.e. up to factor x11.9 or x0.06 per year (not factor x114 or x0.003 per year like BIP-100).
&gt;60% miner vote majority can cause a max. adjustment step of +/-1.6% (BIP-100 has no consequence for 60% majority), i.e. +51% or -34% per year.
&gt;If there is no 60% or 80% majority vote for a block size limit adjustment, then a default increase of +1.09% per 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) takes place, i.e. +32.5% per year = factor x2 per 2.5 years.

  &gt;Hi all, 
I work at an IT department. One of our customers got infected with a cryptolocker virus, and had no backups. He decided to pay the 3 BTC asked, and asked me to help. 
I know bitcoin, even mined them in the early days, but never really used them.

&gt;Upon buying 3 bitcoins, I decided it would be a good idea to get them transferred to our own wallet and be sure nothing went wrong at that step. 
This was not the best idea. Apparantly you have to pay a fee (and I don't have enough bitcoins for that), but you don't if the priority of your coin gets high enough. Upon calculating that, it seemed that I should be OK by tomorrow, so there isn't a real issue.
Of course, Green Address is way behind on the number of confirmations (17 showed vs ~40 actual), so I'm not sure that I'll make it. 

&gt;Another problem is that users seem to experience problems when paying (excessive confirmation times). This all might be a problem, since there is a deadline of 96 hours to pay (we've used roughly 36 hours now).
I'm not sure what would be the best way to proceed. Buy 3 coins again, directly to the attackers address, with my own money (and try to recuperate the 3 coins some way, but probably lose ~50 eur), or wait it out a bit (how reliable is green address?), or buy a bit more coins to cover the transfer fees?  

&gt;I can't mess this up, as it would be a HUGE loss to that person (university prof, multiple years of research/courses/presentations/....). 

&gt;What do you guys think?",2015-09-10 23:12:57+00:00,cuxb2mz,1,t3_3kgzjm,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;To be honest, until the moment the verizon automated voice confirmed the transaction, and e-coin (within seconds) texted my phone to confirm it and tell me my remaining balance, I didn't believe it would go smoothly, if at all.

&gt;I did little research by the way on other services. But I hit on e-coin, decided to try it, and since it worked I thought i'd share the experience for anyone wondering about it.

&gt;So registration was very simple. Verification of id is only required for over set limits (I can't remember what they are, but the $100 bill was under it). It needs a phone for 2fa. Then you just send bitcoin to your account (takes about 15 min to start confirming, then 6 confirmations till it's done - around an hour total), and from there you can load any one of a dollar, sterling, or euro virtual visa card. Theoretically, anywhere that accepts visa can be used.

&gt;They email you the virtual card details (long number, exp, security code), and the cards seem to load pretty quickly. The virtual cards are free, but you can also buy a physical card (I think it's $17?) that you can use at atm's (for a charge).

&gt;So, I used the card as I would a normal visa card. The verizon system wanted a US, five digit post-code for the billing address, and I just mashed in my UK, longer post-code. For some reason it was content to go through though.

&gt;So, overall, it was a very quick, easy, system. From registration to having a visa card, in dollar, euro, or sterling, loaded via bitcoin and ready to use, could be just an hour and a bit.

&gt;Compared to last year - the only other time I had to sell (and in the end gave up) - this was a breeze. I really hope they can keep it up; so many companies seem to wither or turn into scams, so be careful still - one good example from someone shouldn't be a substitute for research (especially when I didn't really do much myself).

&gt;10/10, would use again. ",2015-09-10 20:43:55+00:00,cux5s18,1,t3_3kgdns,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Non-mining full bitcoin nodes are claimed to be vital for the security of the network.  There are now ~6200 such nodes and their number is falling (and it is not clear how many of them are contributing to the network).

&gt;One of the excuses to retain the 1 MB block size limit is the claim that increasing it may increase cost of operating a full node, and induce many of them to close.  But the magnitude of that effect has not been clearly demonstrated.

&gt;On the other hand, retaining the 1 MB cap may actually increase the load on the nodes. 

&gt;Currently, any user who pays more than the minimum fee will usually see his transactions confirmed in the next 1-3 non-empty blocks.  Therefore, users can assemble and sign their transactions offline, then broadcast their trasnactions to the network, and be confident that tehy will be confirmed as soon as possible.  If they need to know whether their transaction has confirmed, they can just check 1-3 mined blocks in services like Blockchain.Info.

&gt;If the network is congested, however, users who care about the confirmation delay will have to query several full rrelay nodes (or some service that queries several full relay nodes continuously) to obtain information about the state of the queue, before assembling the transaction.  Specifically, they need to know at least how many unconfirmed transactions are paying more than X in fees (BTC/kB), for various values of X.  

&gt;Those clients will also want to check the queue periodically to update that information, and top up the fee as needed.  Each top-up will generate another transaction request that will have to be propagated to all nodes.  

&gt;Whil only a fraction of the individual users may have sufficient time and urgency to engage in this interaction with the system, some high-volume institutional users (such as CoinJoin) may automate the process, and issue multiple top-up requests for thousands of transctions.

&gt;In summary, the ""fee market"" may well increase the interaction and (byte traffic) between users and the bitcoin syste; and some of that extra load will have to involve the relay nodes.  Thus, the ""fee market"" may precipitate the negative historical trend in the number of relay nodes, instead of stopping it, or slowing it down.",2015-09-10 20:39:39+00:00,cux5m2y,1,t3_3kgcxe,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;If you had some magic button that would obliterate bitcoin completely, would you press it if you were offered 1 million fiat dollars to do so?  What if you were also told that 20 other people were made the same offer, so you can either play along or be left out in the cold with nothing?  Or, what if the button didn't kill bitcoin completely, but it just forever limited it to hobby/toy level usage?

&gt;Similarly, what if you ran a highly popular message forum and were offered a large sum of money to assert a particular agenda that wasn't in the best interest of bitcoin?  Or, what if you were facing potential prosecution for facilitating illegal activity on your message forum, or enormous tax liability on unreported digital currency income, and some company stepped in with an offer to cover your defense?

&gt;Think about it honestly.  Would you do it for $1M or maybe even less?

  &gt;Maybe the goal is to intentionally force bitcoin to fail, so some wight knight can ride in and save bitcoins with permissioned blockchains, or offer some working patch that changes it into a permissioned blockchain.  Maybe individual key developers, and some of the most prominent miners have been offered huge financial incentives by key players in the banking system if they go along with it.   

&gt;I don't know, but all the politics lately just seems odd to me.   Usually politics in other venues like this comes about when somebody is trying to find an excuse to take something that isn't theirs, because they don't want to work for it or take the risk and effort necessary to get it themselves.   Since decentralized blockchain technology denies political manipulators the power of the state to impose their will, maybe they've moved to stage two, political manipulation of the technology.   Specifically, politicize development.   ",2015-09-10 19:10:28+00:00,cux23ma,1,t3_3kfx7y,12,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Durante la ultima semana pudimos observar como el precio del bitcoin se estabilizo manteniÃ©ndose en el nivel de los 230 Usd, despuÃ©s de la abrupta caÃ­da de la semana anterior vimos como el precio comenzÃ³ a escalar levemente hasta alcanzar el nivel de precio actual. Para la siguiente semana podemos esperar que el precio siga repuntando de manera leve pero sostenida si no rompe la resistencia de los 229 Usd.

&gt;Barclays ha anunciado que va a dar sus primeros pasos hacia el apoyo a la utilizaciÃ³n del bitcoin como un mÃ©todo de pago alternativo, al permitir a las organizaciones benÃ©ficas aceptar donaciones en la moneda digital.

&gt;En un nuevo artÃ­culo publicado en The Sunday Times, la empresa multinacional de servicios financieros dio a entender que habÃ­a entrado en asociaciÃ³n con una â€œplataforma de intercambio de bitcoin o gastoâ€ sin nombre, y que buscarÃ­a dar lanzamiento formal al servicio en el aÃ±o 2016.

&gt;El jefe de diseÃ±o y oficial digital Derek White proporcionÃ³ la fuente de noticias con pocos detalles acerca de la asociaciÃ³n, con excepciÃ³n de afirmar que estaba en desarrollo.

&gt;White dijo al Times:

&gt;â€œBarclays estÃ¡ permitiendo el intercambio de bitcoin para ayudar a organizaciones benÃ©ficas a aceptar bitcoin.â€

&gt;El anuncio sigue a otros que sugieren que el banco estÃ¡ aumentando constantemente sus esfuerzos para comprender y aplicar el bitcoin y la tecnologÃ­a blockchain.

&gt;A principios de este aÃ±o, Barclays revelÃ³ que estaba llevando a cabo una prueba de concepto con el proveedor de intercambio y servicios europeos Safello, una decisiÃ³n que siguiÃ³ a las noticias de marzo que habÃ­a aceptado tres empresas de la industria en su programa acelerador FinTech.

&gt;A medida que el debate continÃºaâ€Šâ€”â€Šdado a que se agrego combustible por la reciente liberaciÃ³n de Bitcoin XTâ€Šâ€”â€Šsobre el tamaÃ±o de bloque- Los interesados en bitcoin estÃ¡n eligiendo lados sobre cÃ³mo debe escalar la moneda.

&gt;Ya se trate de un aumento de 8 MB, o un lÃ­mite dinÃ¡mico elegido por la elite de minerÃ­a de la moneda, estamos teniendo en cuenta las decisiones de la industria hasta el momento.

&gt;Se puede ver los resultados de las 15 organizaciones mineras mÃ¡s grandes y de los 10 proveedores de servicios de bitcoin mejor financiados.

&gt;El mapa indica tambiÃ©n que propuesta ha recibido el mayor apoyo geogrÃ¡ficamente.

&gt;Los usuarios de ChangeTip pueden ahora intercambiar sus consejos de divisas digitales con bienes de la vida real, gracias a la integraciÃ³n con el proveedor de tarjetas de regalo digital, Gyft.

&gt;El servicio de inflexiÃ³n bitcoin, que ha recaudado $ 4,25 millones en financiamiento a la fecha, las marcas como un â€œlove buttonâ€ â€œpara varios redes sociales como Facebook, Twitter y Redditâ€.

&gt;Hasta ahora, los usuarios de ChangeTip podÃ­an recargar sus cuentas a travÃ©s de Coinbase, bitcoin o con tarjeta de crÃ©dito / dÃ©bito, sin embargo sÃ³lo podÃ­an cobrar en bitcoin. Tras el anuncio de ayer por la tarde , ahora tienen la opciÃ³n de canjear tarjetas de regalo de Starbucks, iTunes, Xbox y Amazon. que Van desde U$D 1 hasta U$D 2.000.

&gt;El brazo de riesgo de un importante fondo de pensiones canadiense informa, que esta mirando la realizaciÃ³n de inversiones en startups de Bitcoin y blockchain.

&gt;El Sistema de Retiro de Empleados Municipales de Ontario, o OMERS, es uno de los mayores fondos de pensiones municipales de CanadÃ¡. El brazo de riesgo del fondo, OMERS Ventures, recientemente ha descrito en una reciente entrevista con TechVibes, una publicaciÃ³n canadiense que el negocio estaba explorando el uso de los ingresos de $ 260 millones de fondos de CAD para realizar inversiones en el espacio bitcoin.

&gt;El fondo tambiÃ©n ha atraÃ­do el apoyo del Banco de Montreal y Cisco Inversiones.

&gt;El director general Jim Orlando dijo durante la entrevista:

&gt;â€œLa ciberseguridad es otra Ã¡rea que hemos estado viendo, especÃ­ficamente en FinTech como Sid mencionado, y en particular lo que bitcoin y la capacidad de la cadena de bloque de traer en tÃ©rminos, oportunidades diferenciadas. Tenemos la esperanza de encontrar un par de las inversiones para el Fondo II relacionadas con el Bitcoin y la blockchain, y el lado de la seguridad de todo ese paradigma â€œ.

&gt;OMERS Ventures, indicÃ³ a principios de esta semana en su sitio web que pondrÃ­a un fuerte Ã©nfasis en las empresas de tecnologÃ­a financiera, incluyendo aquellas en el espacio bitcoin. Una infografÃ­a publicada por la firma incluye una serie de nuevas empresas Bitcoin basadas â€‹â€‹en CanadÃ¡.

  &gt;I'm interested in purchasing a small ASIC Miner for the sake of  having some stake in the Bitcoin network other than just HODLing, reading the news, and hoping a merchant I use will actually start accepting Bitcoin.

&gt;Poking around on the Internet, I haven't found any ASIC retailers that looked remotely credible. The reviews of Butterfly Labs are terrible, taking months or years to ship products, and everything they listed was out of stock. The Antminer ASICs I saw on bitmaintech.com were far more than I was looking to spend. Other websites looked sketchy at best. I've read several reviews of people who got ripped off, or waited months for their products to ship.

&gt;I'm not under any delusion of making my money back. But I'm not opposed to putting a few hundred dollars into an ASIC that outputs a few hundred GH/s and uses less than 30 kwh/day in power... if it is likely to actually show up.

&gt;Any thoughts or recommendations on where to look?",2015-09-10 19:07:31+00:00,cux1ziu,1,t3_3kfwq1,11,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I've made about a half dozen orders on purse.io, everythings worked fine until now. I ordered an amazon basic keyboard, and the price estimate was off, so it was canceled. Big deal, buy another one and it asks me to deposit more. No biggie, I do so. Then the escrow balance from the previous transaction did not appear as withdrawable. Okay, contact support, its a holiday weekend, they'll get to me. Well its been 3 days now, and the balance in escrow from my canceled purchase DISAPPEARED FROM MY ESCROW WALLET. 

&gt;Has anybody else had something similar happen recently? I'm about ready to never use the service again if I don't here from someone soon. They effectively stole about 11 dollars from me. ",2015-09-10 19:05:04+00:00,cux1w2v,1,t3_3kfwa7,14,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I've heard 2 rumors about Blockchain.info being comprimised, and I still getting confused with mobile wallets like Mycellium on how their system of deterministic wallets works.

&gt;I sent money to my friend, he's using mycellium. Here's his address  [https://blockchain.info/address/1NcaNzL9swyfQm1nQdAgcc2MY3NcHC5Lqr](https://blockchain.info/address/1NcaNzL9swyfQm1nQdAgcc2MY3NcHC5Lqr)  - few hours ago we sent Bitcoins there several times using the same address. But now the latest transaction (for 0.015 BTC) can't be seen in history or balance on friend's phone on mycellium.

&gt;Just trying to figure out - where it go wrong? According to blockchain.info transaction is on the blockchain, but according to mycellium, funds didn't arrived.

  &gt;La ultima semana pudimos observar como el precio del Bitcoin siguiÃ³ recomponiÃ©ndose de manera constante hasta alcanzar un tope en los 246 USD. en el dÃ­a de ayer, para finalmente ajustar hacia los 240 USD en la jornada de hoy. Podemos esperar que la moneda se mantenga en alza durante la semana siguiente y podemos esperar un salto grande hacia la linea de los 260 USD. si es que el precio logra romper con la resistencia de los 250 USD.

&gt; [https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1137/1*M6Yb9i_JZEMWNd-UMtSa-w.png](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1137/1*M6Yb9i_JZEMWNd-UMtSa-w.png) 

&gt;El Dinero en efectivo y las donaciones en especie son los dos tipos principales de alivio cuando se trata de ayudar a aquellos que han sufrido los desastres naturales, pero el bitcoin se estÃ¡ convirtiendo en una opciÃ³n cada vez mÃ¡s popular.

&gt;A raÃ­z del tsunami de 2004, mÃ¡s de $ 14 mil millones de dolares fueron prometidos por la comunidad internacional para el socorro y la recuperaciÃ³n de los 14 paÃ­ses afectados por el desastre naturalâ€Šâ€”â€Šuno de los mÃ¡s mortÃ­feros registrados en la historia.

&gt;Paul Currion, un consultor independiente para las organizaciones humanitarias, dijo a CoinDesk que este â€œenorme outpour de apoyo pÃºblicoâ€ significa a una gran cantidad de organizaciones tener mÃ¡s fondos de los que pueden procesar y distribuir fÃ¡cilmente.

&gt;Las donaciones en efectivo pueden ser favorecidas sobre las donaciones en especie, con estas Ãºltimas que han sido criticadas en el pasado por lo que es mÃ¡s difÃ­cil para que coincida con las necesidades de los destinatarios, y al hacerlo, debilitarlos y amedrentarlos.

&gt;SegÃºn Currion, que actualmente estÃ¡ trabajando con la Red de inicio para explorar el potencial de la tecnologÃ­a blockchain, una de las mayores caÃ­das de la ayuda en el pasado ha sido debido a el uso de una â€œrespuesta plan maestroâ€ para cada desastre. Ã‰l dijo:

&gt;â€œEso obviamente hecho por razones de facilidadâ€Šâ€”â€Šque no tiene que volver a inventar la rueda cada vez que hay un nuevo desastre â€¦ por otro lado, lo que eso significa es nuestras opciones son limitadas y que, a su vez, ha limitado las opciones de las personas que han sido afectadas por el desastre â€œ.

&gt;La oficina de USAID para la Asistencia de Desastres en el Extranjero, Alimentos para la Paz y el Laboratorio de Desarrollo Global se hicieron eco de las afirmaciones de Currion y ese dinero puede ser mÃ¡s beneficioso que los regalos en especie, y seÃ±alÃ³ que, en las circunstancias apropiadas, las intervenciones basadas en efectivo pueden estimular las economÃ­as locales.

&gt;Actualmente, el efectivo de ayuda se distribuye de forma directa, se transfiriÃ³ a una cuenta bancaria o en un sistema de dinero mÃ³vil, como en Kenia M-Pesa, o mediante el uso de vales, que pueden ser reembolsados en los comercios locales.

&gt;La CompaÃ±Ã­a Multinacional de seguros y gestiÃ³n de activos AXA tiene en la mira al bitcoin para ayudar a simplificar el mercado de remesas.

&gt;Minh Q Tran( Socio general de la divisiÃ³n de Fondo de Riesgo) dijo que AXA Strategic Ventures ,fondo con una recaudaciÃ³n de $ 223m,y su acelerador, AXA factory, estÃ¡n tratando la moneda digital como una â€œtesis de inversiÃ³nâ€.

&gt;Ã‰l dijo:

&gt;â€œCreemos que muchos casos de uso relacionados con Bitcoin todavÃ­a no se han explorado. En particular, estamos muy interesados â€‹â€‹en cÃ³mo bitcoin, y mÃ¡s en general las cryptocurrencies, podrÃ­an ser utilizadas en el mercado de remesas.â€

&gt;Aunque no hay Bitcoin o blockchain startups que hayan recibido fondos de AXA hasta ahora, Tran dijo que la empresa estÃ¡ en conversaciones con varias empresas rebittance â€˜que buscan interrumpir el sector de $ 582bn.

&gt;MÃ¡s allÃ¡ de las remesas

&gt;Aparte del uso de bitcoin en el mercado de remesas, AXA estÃ¡ explorando cÃ³mo la tecnologÃ­a blockchain podrÃ­a ser utilizada en campos como el inmobiliario, la gestiÃ³n de la riqueza, la propiedad intelectual yâ€Šâ€”â€Šcrucialmenteâ€Šâ€”â€ŠSeguro. Esta noticia coincide con el anuncio de hoy de Kamet, del banco incubadora de 111m Â£ â€˜InsurTechâ€™.

&gt;Aunque la banca sigue siendo una industria de aversiÃ³n al riesgo, muchas empresas de renombre estÃ¡n explorando el potencial de la tecnologÃ­a a travÃ©s de sus brazos blockchain VC.

&gt;Bankinter de EspaÃ±a se convirtiÃ³ en el primer banco en financiar una empresa bitcoin, Coinffeine, en noviembre pasado tras una inversiÃ³n no revelada de su FundaciÃ³n para la InnovaciÃ³n. Empresas incluyendo BBVA desde entonces han seguido su ejemplo.

&gt;Otros estÃ¡n explorando tecnologÃ­as personalizados a travÃ©s de la I + D en la empresa. UBS tiene una residencia de un aÃ±o en Londres a Nivel incubadora FinTech 39 para trabajar en prueba de conceptos que podrÃ­an beneficiar a sus grupos de interÃ©s. Mientras tanto, Ken Moore, director de los Laboratorios de InnovaciÃ³n de Citi, revelÃ³ que el banco estaba probando su propia criptomoneda, Citicoin.

&gt;El Servicio de Alguaciles de los Estados Unidos (USMS) ha puesto de manifiesto que es probable que la subasta de los bitcoins restantes confiscados al mastermind de la ruta de la seda Ross Ulbricht ocurra en algÃºn momento de 2015.

&gt;En total, los USMS incautaron mÃ¡s de 144.000 BTC (entonces por un valor de $ 122 millones) de Ulbricht a finales de 2013, junto con 29.655 BTC en carteras en el mercado negro en lÃ­nea en el momento de su cierre.

&gt;El evento serÃ¡ la ultima subasta que implica bitcoins de la investigaciÃ³n de la Ruta de la Seda, con 44.336 BTC ($ 10 millones al cierre de esta ediciÃ³n) que se ofrece a los posibles inversores.

&gt;Un portavoz de los USMS dijo a CoinDesk:

&gt;â€œTodavÃ­a no tenemos fechas para anunciar, pero sÃ­ esperamos que [la realizaciÃ³n del evento] sea antes de que finalice el aÃ±o.â€

&gt;Hasta la fecha, los USMS ha celebrado tres subastas abiertas a los miembros calificados de la opiniÃ³n pÃºblica estadounidense, en un intento de subastar los activos.

&gt;El evento mÃ¡s reciente, celebrado en marzo, vio 14 postores compitiendo para comprar 50.000 BTC (entonces por un valor de $ 13,4 millones).

&gt;Bitcoin Group esta por hacer su tercer intento de IPO este mes de noviembre, despuÃ©s de dos Ã³rdenes de detenerlo por parte de la ComisiÃ³n de Valores e Inversiones de Australia (ASIC).

&gt;La firma de Melbourne primero anunciÃ³ que buscarÃ­a una oferta pÃºblica inicial (OPI) en la Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) en octubre pasado, los retrasos sin embargo, se ha enfrentado a raÃ­z de una reprimenda por parte del regulador en febrero y dos Ã³rdenes de stop en su prospecto de los inversores en julio.

&gt;SegÃºn el Sydney Morning Herald, la firma presentÃ³ un prospecto actualizado el viernes pasado despuÃ©s de que el ASIC levantÃ³ su segunda orden de suspensiÃ³n. Su fecha de inclusiÃ³n se establece ahora para el 11 de noviembre.

&gt;El CEO del Grupo Bitcoin, Sam Lee dijo a la publicaciÃ³n que, como su salida a bolsa sentÃ³ un precedente, se exigiÃ³ revisiones para que los inversionistas puedan ser â€œplenamente informadosâ€, y agregÃ³:

&gt;â€œEl papel del ASIC para proteger a los inversores australianos significa que necesitan para entender nuestro modelo de negocio Ãºnico. Apreciamos la paciencia del ASIC que han llevado a entender lo que hacemos, y agradecemos su cooperaciÃ³n en ayudar a asegurar nuestro prospecto que refleja con precisiÃ³n la oportunidad actual y futuro del Bitcoin Group â€œ.

&gt;Aunque otras empresas Bitcoin, incluyendo digitalBTC y Bitcoin Shop han tenido acciones negociadas pÃºblicamente, Bitcoin Group se mantiene como la primera empresa de la moneda digital en hacer una salida a bolsa, ya que ha evitado pasar por las llamadas â€œlistas de puerta trasera â€˜.

&gt;Con sede en Melbourne, Bitcoin Group actualmente ofrece el arbitraje de la criptomoneda, pero dijo CoinDesk que la idea serÃ­a cambiar a la minerÃ­a de la moneda si su salida a bolsa es un Ã©xito. Se planea emitir 100 millones de nuevas acciones a 20 Â¢ cada uno. Alrededor del 90% de los fondos de la empresa se destinarÃ¡n a la compra de energÃ­a de la CPU.

  &gt;I am looking to purchase Bitcoins via PayPal, the currency that I am using is Canadian. I was wondering how the process would go? I know that you have to have a wallet and what-not, and you purchase BTC from exchanges? I've looked around and seem various exchanges, but I'm not sure if they're reliable. Also, when you purchase them from exchanges, how do they get transferred into the ""wallet""? If someone could give me an explanation on how all this works that would be great!

&gt;I was also wondering if I could mine BTC as a casual miner. Maybe 3-4 hours a day? I doubt I would get any profit, but I'm just wondering...

&gt;Any help would be appreciated!",2015-09-10 18:04:14+00:00,cuwzhz9,1,t3_3kflbd,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I have a web application that I want to program in JavaScript to generate new addresses for an existing Copay wallet from which I have extracted the extended public key.

&gt;I have read that it is generally possible to create addresses from an extended public key, however all of my attempts to send bitcoin to the generated addresses using the extended public key of a Copay wallet have failed, wasting bitcoin in the process.

&gt;When I tried using the schildbach Android Bitcoin Wallet it worked. I've been using both the Bitcore Playground and  [https://bip32jp.github.io/english/](https://bip32jp.github.io/english/)  to generate the addresses for testnet. My inputs are the extended public key (""tpub..."") and path ""m/0/0/..."".

&gt;What do I need to do in order to create working receive addresses for Copay wallets, for both testnet and mainnet, and both 1-of-1 and m-of-n wallets?

&gt;Would it have something to do with the path? I'm aware that Copay wallets use paths like ""m/45'/2147483647/0/0"". However Bitcore Playground doesn't accept the ""2147483647"" part and bip32jp.github.io doesn't accept the apostrophe in the path (that indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used).

&gt;I know that there are some highly knowledgeable people here (e.g. kinoshitajona) who may already have the answers, so I'm looking forward to some guidance. Thank you in advance.",2015-09-10 16:44:42+00:00,cuwwf0q,1,t3_3kf799,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I thought you fellow redditors would appreciate this interview from  [Bitcoinist.net](http://bitcoinist.net/inside-bitcoins-san-diego-digital-currency-institutes-steven-michaels-speaks/) . If you like it come and see me at the  [Bitcoin Investor Conference](http://bitcoininvestor.com)  in Vegas or at  [Inside Bitcoins](http://insidebitcoins.com)  in San Diego:

&gt;**What role do you want the Digital Currency Institute to attain in bitcoin related circles?**

&gt;â€œI want DCI to be known for its support and training of the cypherpunk ideals â€“ primarily the idea of sound money that empowers mutual, voluntary exchange while being resistant to third-party interference.

&gt;Our instructional focus is on:

&lt;ol&gt;
Wallet security best practices
Economics of Bitcoin
Familiarity with the tools that make using Bitcoin easier while preserving or enhancing its privacy and censorship resistant nature.â€
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;**What are your thoughts on Bitcoin XT? Do you plan to address it at the conference?**

&gt;â€œIâ€™m not a computer scientist but I do have a good understanding of economics. From that perspective, the most important features of Bitcoin, in my view, are 1) Its potential to act as a long-term store of value; 2) Privacy; and 3) its ability to act as a tool for self-defense against tyranny.â€

&gt;â€œIâ€™m not a fan of XT Coin personally but Iâ€™m glad it was released because it has forced the public debate on many levels. It is also a â€œstress testâ€ for Bitcoin itself. At any rate, it looks like Bitcoin is working like it is supposed to. Consensus is hard and it should be extremely difficult to make changes to the core protocol. Ultimately, the market always decides and I think it is making the right choice at the moment by rejecting XT Coin in its original form.â€

&gt;**How much time have you been aware of bitcoin. Consequently, working with it?**

&gt;â€œI was first introduced to Bitcoin in January of 2011 but I didnâ€™t really take notice until the June, 2011 article in Gawker Magazine which was a story on The Silk Road. When I learned that a persecuted minority of the population could trade freely using this amazing new currency I immediately saw its potential for enhancing individual liberty. It is truly revolutionary. Iâ€™ve been hooked and involved full time ever since.â€

&gt;**What are your thoughts on Bitlicense?**

&gt;â€œI am against violence in every form. All licensing is simply the use of violence by some people to restrict the lives of other people. Licensing â€“ and most laws â€“ are the act of committing an immediate and certain crime (restricting voluntary association) with the hopes of stopping a possible, future crime. Licensing is anti-human and anti-life at its core. Committing an immediate crime to hopefully prevent a future crime is unacceptable in a free society.â€

&gt;**What do you hope to achieve at the upcoming Inside Bitcoins conference?**

&gt;â€œMy goal is to always promote tools that can maximize individual liberty and provide for self-defense against tyranny. Bitcoin is one of these tools if used properly and I hope to convey this message to all who care to listen.â€

&gt;**Consider the pros and cons of using Bitcoin. Which pro outweighs most of the cons?**

&gt;â€œWithout a doubt it would be its potential to act as a long-term store of value. Capital always flows to where it is respected and protected. Bitcoin protects capital because bitcoin is in limited in supply, it is relatively easy to protect, and it is useful in trade. Capital (property) is the product of our life energy. Capital is the fruit of our labor. Capital is life. Bitcoin is life. If you value your life you should pay attention to Bitcoin.â€",2015-09-10 16:44:21+00:00,cuwwejr,1,t3_3kf76v,4,BitcoinAll

My memory pool is rarely more than 500Kb and only touched the 3000 transaction level once so far in this attack (it was interesting to see the what happened at 3000 as tx's started getting pruned).  My network bandwidth is higher than usual but not bad at all, about 80kb/s in and out, and not effecting any other work I'm doing on my laptop.

  &gt;I think bitcoin is a great idea. I think it's genius and that it could rule the marketplace. The problem is that I don't think it WILL rule the marketplace. I think this for a variety of reasons. Every single fucking time I post in this subreddit my negative opinion is met with statements like ""you are wrong."" No argument is made. No discussion occurs. I receive a pile of downvotes, and that's the end of it. This community seems to outright refuse to consider that maybe bitcoin isn't a good idea. Any negativity is so toxic to the average  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  - er that it's downvoted on contact, stifling discussion.

&gt;I seriously think that bitcoin is a risky buy. For some reason, this community is worse than  [/r/Atheism](/r/Atheism)  talking to the WBC when they are talking to those who don't think bitcoin is the hottest buy on planet earth. This is bad for this subreddit, it's bad for bitcoin, and it's going to be really fucking bad for all of the people who are heavily invested. Propagandizing yourself with positive bitcoin information is not a sound investment strategy. To make a good decision you need to hear the good and the bad, but the bad gets smothered here.

  &gt;In my bread wallet app I can see my balance (approx 1.17 BTC) and my receiving address is shown. However when I check the address on blockchain.info it reads 0 BTC. Address in question: 1EAzQqGJ5BFvxq1vdom8aA4Z1dSEnyMYJX

&gt;Does BreadWallet use an intermediary 'receiving' wallet?",2015-09-10 11:45:13+00:00,cuwn1ye,1,t3_3kdxc6,9,BitcoinAll

  &gt;This thread is open for discussion on block size and hard forks.

&gt;New submissions regarding block size and hard forks are not permitted at this time, so unless you have very substantial news to share, post your questions and comments here. Please read the following guidelines before proceeding:


&gt;There's a new subreddit guideline in the sidebar. It reads:


&gt;Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.

&gt;Discussing the merits and drawbacks of  [BIP 100](http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf) ,  [BIP 101](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki) ,  [BIP 102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/173/files) , Pieter Wuille's  [BIP ???](https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6)  and other proposals is encouraged.
&gt;Themes regarding hard forks in general, such as what happens when they occur, how to ensure the fork is successful, and how the bitcoin network can react to hard forks which are potentially hostile, are open for discussion.
&gt;Avoid personal attacks and emotionally charged arguments.
&gt;No meta discussion.
&gt;Stay on topic.


&gt;There's been a lot of great discussion so far. Let's avoid falling back into voting cliques. They harm the discussion and will have no impact on the outcome of this debate. 


**Don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.",2015-09-10 11:03:19+00:00,cuwmcfq,1,t3_3kds7r,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Lets say I am buying coffee for breaking using Bitcoin, or say buying a computer from NewEgg for $600.  How much should that cost?  I think that the current  [$7 per transaction](https://blockchain.info/charts/cost-per-transaction)  is quite high, and results due to a speculative bubble.  Can you imagine paying for a $4 coffee with a $7 transaction cost?   That doesn't make sense at all.  I think it should be more around 40 cents currently for transactions.

&gt;Currently, paypal is 30 cents + 3%, so a $4 coffee would be 30 cents + 12 cents = 42 cents.  ",2015-09-10 08:10:26+00:00,cuwkaef,1,t3_3kdc8e,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I had this thought today while thinking that Bitcoin users often joke that Coinbase is no better than a traditional bank, based on the amount of data they collect about their users and the frequent complaints about accounts being arbitrarily closed.

&gt;Which made me wonder, what would be the requirements for Coinbase to provide the same services as an actual bank? At the moment, you can already deposit, sell, buy and withdraw bitcoin. You can also deposit fiat and withdraw it to the bank account of your choice, but how hard would it be to give each user an account number that could then be used to pay bills the same way you do with your phone operator (in Europe, it would be your IBAN number)?

&gt;You can then keep both crypto and fiat on the same place, and go from one to the other seamlessly with the integrated exchange. We're still waiting for the day a bank will integrate bitcoin for customers, but I have no clue if it wouldn't actually be easier for a bitcoin company to get a banking licence.",2015-09-10 07:58:26+00:00,cuwk4he,1,t3_3kdb25,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I was just doing my small bit of community service in small blockistan for the week - correcting a couple of obvious misconceptions before the falsehoods could perpetuate and grow into fables - and something occurred to me...

&gt;Because as I habitually went to link to a relevant line of code from github, I suddenly realized that speaking of such things in small blockistan might get me banned or my comment deleted. This means that it's very hard to simply tell the truth and even harder for people there to discern what is true.

&gt;It reminded me of something John Stuart Mill said in  [On Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Liberty) , which (to paraphrase) is that freedom of speech is important because it allows people to express ideas that challenge the status quo - not just because it's some ""god given right"" as many people seem to (ironically) believe.

&gt;That's very important, because it allows everyone to consider different ideas (even if they turn out to be wrong) and this generally evolves the status quo ideas and makes them stronger. A related idea from Mill is that ideas are rarely totally false. Many ideas contain elements of truth or wisdom even if they're not wholly true.

&gt;Mill explains it more elegantly than I do at length:


&gt;We have now recognized the necessity to the mental well-being of mankind (on which all their other well-being depends) of freedom of opinion, and freedom of the expression of opinion, on four distinct grounds; which we will now briefly recapitulate.

&gt;First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.

&gt;Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision of adverse opinions, that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied.

&gt;Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds.

&gt;And not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.


&gt;This is quite a famous text, so I assume many people have read it at some point and I'm just refreshing your memories. If you haven't come across it before, I strongly recommend it. As far as books go, it's  [relatively short](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm)  by today's standards.

&gt;This obviously cuts both ways and that's why I appreciate people like  [/u/nullc](/u/nullc)  (Greg Maxwell) coming to this sub and debating ideas even in the face of strong opposition and unnecessary personal attacks and innuendo (doing his bit of community service for us, even if not everyone appreciates it).  [/u/gavinandresen](/u/gavinandresen)  and  [/u/mike_hearn](/u/mike_hearn)  do the same service in small blockistan, when they have time, and remember that these are all busy people (so we should help when we can spare the time).

&gt;Two final comments before this becomes a long rant (too late maybe?).

&gt;Firstly, the most counter-productive thing on both sides of this debate is that we allow the debate to descend into pointless ad hominem 'arguments'. That's because it shuts down and eventually silences the real debate. It only serves to soothe our own egos for a short moment. We all do it sometimes, because that's one of the flaws we humans all share, but we can set a good example for the whole community by trying to be better.

&gt;Secondly, I believe that there are elements of truth on both sides of this debate. Even if I don't agree with everything Greg thinks or says, I understand his concerns and appreciate him taking the time to explain them. Likewise, I understand Gavin and Mike's concerns and that's why I'm running XT. It's usually the case when politics arises anywhere that neither side can claim a monopoly on the 'truth'.

&gt;You may regard that view as 'indecisive', but it's doesn't mean you don't make a choice and I don't think either side is close to what Mill would call the 'wholly true' view of the world yet. Those with passionate, strong views sometimes overlook this.

&gt;So let's take a leaf out of Bill and Ted's Exellent Adventure's (and  [/r/bitcoinmarkets](/r/bitcoinmarkets) ') book, ""be excellent to each other... and... party on, dudes.""",2015-09-10 06:58:24+00:00,cuwj7uz,1,t3_3kd4ve,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Mycelium Wallet for Android v2.5 is finally out after a long long time in beta. Some major new features in this one!


Added support for the Ledger hardware wallet, including  [Ledger Nano](https://www.ledgerwallet.com)  and  [HW.1](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/shop)  via USB, and also Ledger-Unplugged.
Added support for Coinapult, a new account type which uses Coinapult Locks, allowing you to ""lock"" your Bitcoin value to USD. It works by simply transferring bitcoins in and out of your Coinapult account right from within the wallet (minimum required to lock is $1), and any coins transfered to that account will stay at the same USD value until they get pulled out.
Added support for many more Block Explorers (besides blockchain.info), which you can choose in Settings.
Added the option to copy input/output-amounts using LongClick in transaction details
Added support Bip73, which uses more compact QR codes for merchant payment requests
Wallet now shows fiat value for payment requests
Minor UI changes
[bugfix] Fix error in transaction history, if no fiat currency is selected
[bugfix] Enforce startup-pin on launch if starting wallet via LocalTrader notification


&gt;Ledger and Coinapult are our most exciting features this time. We hope that now that users are able to lock their account value to the value of USD, those who were worried about using Bitcoin due to high volatility (such as merchants in areas without access to BitPay type services) will now be willing to give Bitcoin a try. Who knows, maybe it'll finaly give some competition to MPesa. And Ledger adds a much more affordable option for those who wish to use a more secure dedicated hardware device for storing their Bitcoin savings. Also, don't forget, our European users can already send to SEPA accounts directly from within the walle, too, using  [Cashila](http://cashila.com) . That feature isn't really obvious, since it only shows up if you register for a Cashila account, but let's you pay your bills or transfer money to friends and family right from your wallet.

&gt;We also have some news (in case it was missed earlier). Mycelium managed to raise some funding, and is in the process of hiring developers:

&gt; [https://coinality.com/jobs/front-end-developer-android/](https://coinality.com/jobs/front-end-developer-android/) 
 [https://coinality.com/jobs/front-end-developer-ios/](https://coinality.com/jobs/front-end-developer-ios/) 

&gt;We recently hired a new backend developer, and senior developers for iOS and Android. I have moved from a Community Manager to a Product Manager for the wallet (I'll still be doing community managing though). And we also have some BIG changes planned for our wallet. Much of the wallet will be redesigned from scratch, and the main changes you will see are:


Switch to an open source Bitcoin library, and making our wallet completely open source.
Unified user experience across all platforms (Android, iOS, possibly others), which means everyone gets the same features at the same time (hardware permitting).
Brand new UI, which will greatly simplify use by making navigation much more intuitive, while also allowing us to easily expand the wallet with tons of new features.
Full support for SPV and custom user nodes.
Full dedication to implementing new core Bitcoin functions, like new BIPs, mixing services, stealth addresses, multisig addresses, time locked transactions, transaction channels, etc. (We always wanted to, but until now did not have enouch developers or time to dedicate to it).
Lots of new surprises we can't reveal yet, which we're sure everyone will love.


&gt;These changes won't come quickly, unfortunately, and we will keep updating our old wallet in the mean time, but we'll keep you updated on our progress.",2015-09-10 06:32:36+00:00,cuwis5m,1,t3_3kczlq,1447,BitcoinAll

Brand new UI, which will greatly simplify use by making navigation much more intuitive, while also allowing us to easily expand the wallet with tons of new features.
Full support for SPV and custom user nodes.
Full dedication to implementing new core Bitcoin functions, like new BIPs, mixing services, stealth addresses, multisig addresses, time locked transactions, transaction channels, etc. (We always wanted to, but until now did not have enouch developers or time to dedicate to it).

  &gt;Mycelium Wallet for Android v2.5 is finally out after a long long time in beta. Some major new features in this one!


Added support for the Ledger hardware wallet, including  [Ledger Nano](https://www.ledgerwallet.com)  and  [HW.1](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/shop)  via USB, and also Ledger-Unplugged.
Added support for Coinapult, a new account type which uses Coinapult Locks, allowing you to ""lock"" your Bitcoin value to USD. It works by simply transferring bitcoins in and out of your Coinapult account right from within the wallet (minimum required to lock is $1), and any coins transfered to that account will stay at the same USD value until they get pulled out.
Added support for many more Block Explorers (besides blockchain.info), which you can choose in Settings.
Added the option to copy input/output-amounts using LongClick in transaction details
Added support Bip73, which uses more compact QR codes for merchant payment requests
Wallet now shows fiat value for payment requests
Minor UI changes
[bugfix] Fix error in transaction history, if no fiat currency is selected
[bugfix] Enforce startup-pin on launch if starting wallet via LocalTrader notification


&gt;Ledger and Coinapult are our most exciting features this time. We hope that now that users are able to lock their account value to the value of USD, those who were worried about using Bitcoin due to high volatility (such as merchants in areas without access to BitPay type services) will now be willing to give Bitcoin a try. Who knows, maybe it'll finaly give some competition to MPesa. And Ledger adds a much more affordable option for those who wish to use a more secure dedicated hardware device for storing their Bitcoin savings. Also, don't forget, our European users can already send to SEPA accounts directly from within the walle, too, using  [Cashila](http://cashila.com) . That feature isn't really obvious, since it only shows up if you register for a Cashila account, but let's you pay your bills or transfer money to friends and family right from your wallet.

&gt;We also have some news (in case it was missed earlier). Mycelium managed to raise some funding, and is in the process of hiring developers:

  &gt;I can't maths right and need help from the community to understand the decimal 100 sub-units of ex. U.S. Dollar v.s Bitcoin's 100,000,000 sub-units. To my knowledge this is the first currency with so many sub-units and I was wondering what the community's prediction of how those sub-units will impact the currency as it scales up.

&gt;Also, because it is the first currency with 100,000,000 sub-unitsis this a new evolution of currency considering we know have the technology to use them. The advance decimals of this currency gets little fanfare.",2015-09-10 05:52:00+00:00,cuwi0qp,1,t3_3kcxqm,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;The problem the community was faced with was that an adoption boom could happen at any time, but Core might stall at 1MB and kill it. Creating an alternative implementation and readying it, testing it, familiarizing people with it, and having the debates necessary for people to be comfortable with it - all that would take too long and we'd likely miss that adoption surge. 

&gt;But now the situation is different. XT is a thing. It's not winning by node count at all, but it doesn't have to, because the market will prefer conservatism until change is the only option. That was the very situation we were worried about: what if change is the only option yet change is blockaded by Blockstream? All XT has to do is be locked and loaded, ready with open arms to take in the longsuffering Core refugees. 

&gt;XT doesn't need to be an open floodgate; it just needs to be a floodgate ready to be opened at any time. In that it has already succeeded, and Core feels the pressure as shown by the elevating pitch of attacks. 

&gt;The only question now is, to misquote Mises, ""There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of the 1MB dam. The alternative is only whether the relief should come sooner as the result of Core's voluntary abandonment of the antiquated blocksize cap, or later as a final and total loss of centralized control by Core dev.""",2015-09-10 05:43:09+00:00,cuwhu97,1,t3_3kcwqv,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Let's say a whole new cryptocurrency evolves on a sidechain - let's call that s-coin for now. Does that mean s-coin only needs to be linked to a single Satoshi on the bitcoin blockchain? In other words, can 100m sidechains be created using 1 btc?

&gt;There's been far too much good press about the blockchain recently. My cousin works for a massive investment bank and has always been dismissive of Bitcoin, but even he is now saying its all about the blockchain - not bitcoin. 

&gt;I'd like to know what the possibilities are of the Bitcoin blockchain succeeding, but bitcoin the currency failing. Is there any type of scenario where this can happen?

  &gt;I do have a knowledge of basic economics that prices are determined by supply and demand but I can't see why Bitcoin prices continue to fall day after day. Obviously the previous peak in 2013 was a bubble where Bitcoin was ridiculously overvalued however, surely after almost 2 years the price has recovered to a more suitable equilibrium. Thus if the price is not over or undervalued and more and more people are using it each day (increasing demand) what is driving the price continually down? Surely it's not an oversupply issue. And it is not an issue with strengthening currencies as Bitcoin is losing value against all currencies even the weak ones. I'm interested to see what people think about this. I personally remain long term bullish on Bitcoin prices but I just can't explain what's going on in the short term. Anyone have any idea?",2015-09-10 04:05:21+00:00,cuwfho1,1,t3_3kckvp,11,BitcoinAll

  &gt;First let me say that I admire Gavin. And I have no idea what to believe with all the gossip regarding Mike. I do personally believe that programmers should never make product development decisions. I've been really vocal about that numerous times.

&gt;Nevertheless, I do recall for the last four years, always being under the impression that if bitcoin wants to scale, it needed some way to do so without putting the core code at risk. 

&gt;The person who's opinion I value the most (Andreas)?  I remember him constantly talking about services being built ""on the edges"". Being built on top of bitcoin. 

&gt;Where the protocol itself fell short, products and services built on top of the protocol is where it would shine.

&gt;That was the mantra for years and years. 

&gt;Then the question kept coming up: how are we going to do that? And then someone came up with a brilliant idea. Side change. I was one of the people shouting it from a mountaintop back then. Finally we had our way to scale bit coin and build an list products and services on top of it. Just like with the Internet. You don't continually enhanced TCP/IP do you? You build Amazon.com for shopping. You build a trade for an entire ecosystem of stock trading.  

&gt;Then this whole fight came about. And even I jumped the bandwagon. I'm like whats with all the censorship? And why don't the programmers want Bitcoin to succeed? Etc. etc. 

&gt;But then it hit me again recently: I thought we were going to make Bitcoin awesome, with sidechains, on top of the protocol?  Just like the Internet. 

&gt;So what am I missing here? When did the dialogue completely change from the brilliant introduction of sidechains, to this talk of centralized services.  And I could've sworn even guys like Gavin were on board with ""building products and services on top of the protocol"" where the protocol fell short.",2015-09-10 03:48:34+00:00,cuwf0c0,1,t3_3kcii9,11,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I understand that long term, in the case of a deflationary cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin the one thing that will keep the system going will be transaction fees, and that they are there to somewhat curb spam transactions, but I believe under other rules it should be possible to have a 0 fee tx. cryptocurrency.

&gt;Email, despite being centralized, and despite the size in bytes of emails, and their attachments, and despite the petabytes of spam that are sent day by day is free.

&gt;how come we have to pay so much for ~255 byte sized transactions? (specially since those fees go around like a lottery and they're not evenly distributed to all participants) Doesn't the value provided by the possibilities enabled by such an awesome system like Bitcoin merit the costs of everyone running their nodes? just like email service operators make money indirectly from their services, why couldn't professional network participants build atop Bitcoin and monetize on it to keep everyone's transaction fees free?",2015-09-10 03:13:48+00:00,cuwdyff,1,t3_3kcdr9,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I've noticed on FB and youtube some MLM people promoting Onecoin.  I looked into this a while back and it seemed like a big scam to me, like a real ponzi scheme.  One thing I do notice is that the marketers are using lots of Bitcoin info to promote this like Andreas videos etc.  It seems like it has alot of members (maybe 500k?) but I fear it might reflect badly on crypto in general if/when it crashes.  Anyone else come across this?

  &gt;I'm in a bit of a pickle and I'd like the wisdom of the many to assist me. 

&gt;I need to buy around 1 BTC ASAP but I've run into a dilemma. I only have a debit card and a Wells Fargo checking account (I love in the US).  Normally I use circle to get my coins but I've already used my weekly limit on my debit card and my instant access limit on my bank account purchases. 

&gt;Normally I'd use localbitcoins.com but I got a new phone and I'm waiting the 2 week waiting period before I can reset my 2 factor authentification so that's not an option.  

&gt;I know coinbase also does instant transfers but I need to verify a credit card which I don't have.  

&gt;What is the safest and quickest way to buy bitcoins with my debit card and have the coins.  I need them in at least 24 hours.  

&gt;Thanks for any help and recommendations.  I trust reddit more than any other expert or website I've encountered.",2015-09-09 23:53:30+00:00,cuw7a4o,1,t3_3kbj4k,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I've thinking about how I might setup a large scale mining farm.  I think I would like to do submersion cooling for various reasons.  So right now, I'm trying to do some small scale tests with some S3+'s.  I don't plan to overclock right now.  My main question is:

&gt;**If I use a plastic container ( typical plastic storage container ), and I rise the miner up off of the bottom of the container.  How likely is it that the heat generated by mining might melt the plastic?**

&gt;I'm wanting to do a cheap small scale test.  I know some others use fish tanks, and I see advantages to that.  But I'd rather spend $10 - $20 on the container, not $100+.",2015-09-09 23:30:54+00:00,cuw6j16,1,t3_3kbfaj,3,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hi guys,
I'm a student from Germany and currently doing a paid internship in Campinas - SP Brazil.
Ill be leaving Brazil at the end of the month. My problem is that I will be paid for my internship just a few days before my flight home, so I wont be able to spend all of the money. 
Since Im trying to avoid fees for money exchange I read on the internet that there is a Bitcoin ATM in Sao Paulo where I could buy BTC for Reais.
All the information I found was outdated, so I was thinking there might be a Brazilian redditor who knows weather this ATM still exists and if it would be worth it to go there with around 1000 Reais or if you know any trustworthy sellers at localbitcoins in Sao Paulo or Campinas.
Thanks for any help or advice. ",2015-09-09 22:38:25+00:00,cuw4p2m,1,t3_3kb5x6,10,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Bitcoin is under attack by powerful interests who stand to lose their firm grip on world power if it becomes successful.  This is not news, and they've been fairly effective at keeping bitcoin in check through fairly obvious means (regulation, arrests, extortion, bank account closures/seizures, taxation).

&gt;These enemy forces are also attacking bitcoin from the inside by having infiltrated the developer groups and our communication channels.  This is a challenge for sure, but what aggravates me even more is that many of us do not see what's really happening.  Stop treating these adversaries as if they have valid arguments.  Their aim is to marginalize bitcoin, and they're doing a very good job of it so far.

&gt;To help illustrate what's really going on, imagine you're on the board of directors of Burger King, and McDonald's has infiltrated your inner circle with one of their own operatives.  The infiltrator might even be a smart guy â€“ they obviously wouldn't assign such an important task to a moron.  He might have even made positive contributions in the past to earn some trust, but his goal is also to play the long game.  He doesn't need to destroy your burger empire overnight.  He just needs to gradually chip away at your ability to threaten his own company's interests.

&gt;One day he suggests that Burger King should stop making French fries.  Although this seems like an absurd suggestion, he comes up with all kinds of seemingly reasoned arguments, from things like the cost of fry oil to predictions about the future demand for potato based products.  Not realizing he's an infiltrator working for McDonald's, the other board members begin debating all the various arguments he injects into the meeting.  Some of it even gets quite personal, and some of the board members suggest that we all cool off a little, slow down, and do more research into the French fry market before taking any action in either direction.  Studies and workshops are scheduled to discuss whether the company should expand or reduce its presence in the French fry industry and to research improved methods for peeling potatoes.  However, no rational argument and no amount of scientific data will ever convince the infiltrator to change his mind because he already knows that all his arguments are red herrings.  In the end, he's managed to slow growth, turn the board against itself, and divert the attention of your company's leaders in the wrong direction.

&gt;Don't debate the infiltrator.  Don't try to come up with compromises to satisfy him.  Throw him out if you can.  At the very least, ignore his yammering and march onward with the things that need to be done to grow the company.",2015-09-09 21:13:09+00:00,cuw1k6a,1,t3_3karfe,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Is it just me, or has the tone in some of the more contentious threads around here begun to change subtly? When  [/u/statoshi](/u/statoshi)  started this subreddit, the discussion seemed to focus on giving Theymos his Two Minutes Hate. Now that we seem to have gotten that out of our systems, we're seeing some of the anti-BitcoinXT crew pop in to stir things up, and the conversation almost seems to be something that maybe borders ever so slightly in the general direction of cordial... ish.

&gt;Those here who are anti-anti-BitcoinXT, imagine for a moment that the anti-BitcoinXT crew members really were as unpleasant as you believe. Is it not possible that they might not really like each other, as well?

&gt;Perhaps Core Dev A really is a stinking low-life dirtbag with bad breath and mismatched socks, and Cored Dev B really is a malicious attention-princess out to destroy all that is beautiful that he, himself did not create. How long can it be before they start squabbling amongst themselves? After all, every serious programmer knows that everyone else's code sucks, and by chasing away calm voices and level heads, they've concentrated themselves into the kind of band that many here find rather unpleasant.

&gt;That can't be fun.

&gt;Now, if we make it easy for one or several of them to save face while changing camps, maybe it would be easier for him to do so? [They are all male, right? If not, then mea culpa.]

  &gt;So prepare your DDoS armor and join the team of XT pools who are determined to triumph in the face of all opposition.

&gt;Mike is doing his part by adding stealth mode to nodes. But we must do our part and get those blocks mined.

  &gt;I started running XT a few weeks ago (three separate nodes). Here's the problem: In the past, when running Core,  if I ever got a BSOD or my system otherwise crashed due to any kind of internal or external problem, upon restart Core would just pick up where it had left off.

&gt;With XT, any time the machine shuts down without warning (like when the Windows overlords decide to push an update), XT will tell me it needs to rescan the chain... and there go the next few hours of my life!

&gt;I have absolutely no idea why XT and Core should behave differently post unexpected shutdown, but I swear they do on this end. And it's more than a little bit annoying.

&gt;Will still run XT, though. At least until some other solution to scaling presents itself.",2015-09-09 19:33:35+00:00,cuvxkzh,1,t3_3ka9zh,25,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I landed in DÃ¼sseldorf and strolled through the airport. Then a Visa guy stopped me and wanted to sell some card product to me. I asked him if he knows Bitcoin - he did not hear of it at all. I did not put too much effort into this but explained him the function of electronic money - no idea if he got it. Finally he asked me if I have a bank account and I said NO I just have Bitcoin.

  &gt;I've got a plan to send myself money without incurring the usual high charges but wanted to run it past the community first. 

&gt;I have a bank account in England but live in America, and I occasionally would like to send myself money. Not vast amounts of money, probably no more than 1 or 2BTC a month. The issue with regular money transfers is the fees. I get a transaction fee from the service, as well as a percentage cut, and another transaction fee from my bank. all in all it costs about $30-$40 per transaction... safe to say I don't wanna drop 10% of my cash each month just for moving it. 

&gt;Would a Bitcoin transaction be cheaper/ just as simple?",2015-09-09 19:30:34+00:00,cuvxgii,1,t3_3ka9ki,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;So, I noticed the mempool on my node growing pretty large (25 to 30MB) but not a super-high transaction count (~3-5000).  Still kinda big, but not as big as during the last round of ""tests"".

  &gt;I was wondering if it were possible to create a login system on a website that only uses a bitcoin wallet or something Bitcoin related in order to validate an identity?

&gt;For example instead of logging in as your email address as your username, it is a Bitcoin ID. In order to validate the account when created, a small transaction is made and recorded on the blockchain. 

&gt;Is something like this possible? The reason I ask is because typically to do this you always have to forge your information and create a fake email account, ect. It seems like creating an anonymous account could be a bit more straightforward nowadays. ",2015-09-09 18:59:03+00:00,cuvw7cy,1,t3_3ka42c,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Coinbase offers $75 for referrals to new customers that purchase $100 or more in bitcoin. 

&gt;However a new user to Coinbase is unable to purchase more than $50 per day on their new account. 

&gt;This means that the advertised offer of $75 per new user is ALWAYS IMPOSSIBLE TO FULFILL because of the $50 limit. 

&gt;Obviously Coinbase knows about their limits and therefore it is a MISLEADING and DISHONEST and deeply MANIPULATIVE offer to suggest that they will pay $75 for new user referrals if they purchase more than $100 in bitcoin... since new users are limited to purchasing only $50 per day, this means it is IMPOSSIBLE FOR A NEW USER TO PURCHASE $100 or more in bitcoin and therefore Coinbase NEVER needs to honor its $75 reward for new referrals. 

&gt;THIS IS DEEPLY DISHONEST AND A HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE FOR NEW USERS AND REFERRAL USERS. ",2015-09-09 18:06:32+00:00,cuvu5p0,1,t3_3k9vpv,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;So, for now, this is just a possibility for the future. I have 0 experience mining and I only know the very basics about bitcoin.

&gt;Let's say I start working for a company and I could have one equipment farming there. That's the ""free"" electricity, it's not really free but I'm not the one paying for it. I would most likely just turn it on while I was there (9 to 5), so about 8 hours a day.

&gt;I'd like to know what are the machines I could buy for this. How much each would cost, how much would I get per hour and how much electricity would it consume per hour? (because depending on the size of the company, it could either be an insignificant increase or a big one)

&gt;Also, do I need to be connected to the internet all the time for it to work? Would mining dogecoin or litecoin be a better option? Anything else I might need to know?

  &gt;After many failed attempts at convincing friends/family/co-workers that Bitcoin is beneficial, one of my Minecraft server players asked me about it.  I decided to send over $10 worth on Circle just so he could experience it first-hand.  I didn't expect much, since he's young he might not understand even some basic financial concepts.  I was shocked that within 30 minutes of sending, he was already linking bank acounts to Circle and signing up for multiple sites such as purse.io (shout outs to MadBitcoins !).  When I heard he was going to use purse.io I tried to explain a little how it works, but I've never used it and might be a bit complex for someone so new to Bitcoin.  A few minutes later he said he already made a purchase on purse and someone had accepted, I couldn't believe it.  He then asked me why I didn't suggest to use Coinbase because it looks like it has a lot more options than Circle.  I said I didn't think it would be a good thing for someone new to be overwhelmed with all those options, but he was already signing up and linking his bank account/cards.  I then told him about ChangeTip and he immediately signed up and sent some coins to it.  He said ""Bitcoin is fun"" and I responded ""Exactly!!!"", finally someone gets it!  I didn't even tell him about the exchanges, but he immediately tried to sign up for Coinbase exchange...  He always had to get permission to use his parents credit cards to buy things online, but now he has the freedom to spend and even work for Bitcoin.  (Yes, I know child labor laws could get messy with this, but it's still freedom for youth to start learning job skills early)

&gt;I feel like it's a waste of time trying to convince adults/old people about Bitcoin... let them stay in their old ways if they are really happy with their current banking/creditcard system.  I've also noticed the more financially stable they are (retired, etc) the more defensive they get when you bring up Bitcoin.  They seem to want to attack, possibly because it threatens the way they're used to doing things?  Youth are the ones who get it.  Even though they may not need the freedom, they are probably one of the most restricted groups of people within first world countries.  If a 14 year old wants to learn how to program apps and make some Bitcoin online, why not?  Let them learn responsibility with their own finances with Bitcoin.

&gt;Youth are the 'killer app' in my opinion because if Bitcoin spreads fast for them, their parents will feel the need to understand it more or to send their kids money.  They also have all the time in the world to learn it, use it, and build on it without the need to ever step into a bank, give their identity, or get rejected an account based on factors such as age.",2015-09-09 14:21:19+00:00,cuvlg21,1,t3_3k8una,8,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I think everyone here wish to see an increase in BTC price, if only for the fact that a price increase would be the cause or the effect of an increased BTC adoption.
Obviously we need to focus on the BTC DEMAND (supply is defined and established): we should focus on having people buy BTC.
But who are the potential buyers and for which reason could they be willing to buy? Understanding who can be the next wave of â€œbelieversâ€ is essential to better focus our efforts

&gt;**The potential buyer**

&gt;Iâ€™m a supporter of the â€œdigital goldâ€/â€international store of valueâ€ vision of BTC.  My personal opinion is that a person approaches the BTC primarily as an investment: he/she is persuaded that in the future the value of the cryptocurrency will be higher than the current price (limited supply, low frictions, freedom, 24-7, etc). 
So, which are the characteristics of the potential investor? 

&gt;C1) by definition, the potential purchaser have some money to invest.

&gt;C2) he has a robust risk appetite (as the investment in question is characterized by high volatility and sooner or later could go to ZERO)

&gt;C3) ideally the next wave of buyers should possess a minimum familiarity about the investments world (equities, commodities, VC, etc.). If you never had hold some asset, itâ€™s unlikely you start with BTC. 

&gt;C4) Finally, I believe that our investors should have a certain openness to new technologies..

&gt;Later I will explain where I think itâ€™s possible to find some of these investorsâ€¦

&gt;**The perception of the investment**

&gt;What currently keeps away investors from BTC are essentially three things:

&gt;O1) They are difficult to understand, use and store for the average person

&gt;O2) They are perceived as a nerd game (or worse a petty criminalsâ€™ game) and not as an innovative digital resource

&gt;O3) Itâ€™s difficult / expensive to have exposure (investment only) on it for the average investor (bank wires, registrations, OTC trading, wallets)

&gt;The BTC are therefore a long way from collecting investments from average investor/saver, so we have to find a way for overcoming these three obstacles! What could be the bridge to cross the river?

&gt;**The Bridge between the buyer and the investment**

&gt;I am convinced that one of the ways to overcome these obstacles are financial instruments purchased through traditional brokers. For example, an ETF (eg. Winklevoss), in my opinion would be an indirect instrument to invest and would give a very strong contribution to the spread of BTC because it would be a tool that:

&gt;S1) addresses exactly the ideal target: our investor (who has a trading/investment account has probably the characteristics stated above);

&gt;S2) allows investors to avoid learning exactly what BTC are and work;

&gt;S3) strengthen the association BTC = investment or financial instrument (I buy them with the same channel / broker with whom I buy the APPLE shares), and gives legitimacy to the BTC (if my bank allows me buy them, BTC shouldnâ€™t be so bad)

&gt;S4) You can get exposure with a single click, low cost

&gt;Waiting for the ETFs approval and issuing, I wondered if there are already other instruments that replicate the investment without involving burdens ...

&gt;Thinking about it, even  [CFDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_for_difference)  (contracts for difference) play a role similar to ETFs ... CFDs are practically financial bets (derivatives) on the appreciation or depreciation of an underlying financial asset. CFDs are generally negotiated by the retail investors against their broker. One advantage is therefore a much simpler approval procedure (compliance, SEC, etc).

&gt;In fact there are already some brokers that allow you to negotiate BTC through CFD (PLUS 500, IG, Avatrade). A customer of these brokers can then bet long or short on BTC in the same way he bets on other assets (commodity indices, individual stocks), in a fast, safe, and economical manner.

&gt;**What we can do**

&gt;If each of us would contact our broker to ask for adding the BTC to the assets on which itâ€™s possible to bet/invest we would get many benefits:

&gt;R1) it would get more attention of the financial community (brokers, investment banks, investors) on the subject

&gt;R2) it would create stronger association BTC = Financial Assets

&gt;R3) it would allow those who are vaguely interested in the BTC to have an exposure in a simple way (or at least a first contact)

&gt;So why not ask our brokers to provide BTC CFDs? Imagine what would happen if the BIG Trading Brokers (Fidelity, Scottrade, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade Financial, OptionsHouse, etc) would allow their customers to negotiate BTC ..

&gt;**Disclaimer**

&gt;Off course I own some BTC.. :)
I bought some in 2011 and Iâ€™m still buying since then. My average carrying price  is close to the current price. I am employed at the Headquartiers of a top tier European Bank. Iâ€™m studying for the last step of CFA certification and I am a BA and MSc in Finance. 
And most of all, I am addicted to this sub!",2015-09-09 14:19:40+00:00,cuvldz8,1,t3_3k8udp,11,BitcoinAll

&gt;Equilibria is a brand new concept digital currency to be widely adopted and used in any number of situations. It has been designed to address the issues that currently reside in the popular digital currencies. Such as the ones that Bitcoin and Ethereum suffer from.

&gt;Itâ€™s simple really, one of our developers explained this as a mix between Bitcoin and Boinc.

&gt;Once you have installed either the Command Line or GUI Client you will have an option to do work. Your client will connect to the decentralized network and will send a broadcast out requesting work. The client will then check what transactions are in queue and the client will generate an encrypted package. Rather than just having one difficult hash to find the work package will consist of 32 to 256 small, less difficult hashes to find, each hash should take no longer than 15 minutes to be found. The entire package should take between 8 to 64 Hours to complete with a standard 4-Core 4.00 GHz CPU.

&gt;When our OpenCL / Cuda client has been completed we expect packages to take between 1 to 6 Hours to complete.

&gt;Once the work has been completed you will gain a standard package value of 250. This work will then be displayed on the public work-ledger. Unencrypted clean packages cannot be made anonymous. The network needs to know how much currency is in circulation so that you are able to use it.

&gt;With this system we believe that Equilibria will never be out of reach to the general population and will not require any specialist hardware such as FPGA or ASIC devices.",2015-09-09 14:16:54+00:00,cuvlald,1,t3_3k8tza,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;There are many opposing viewpoints about tomorrowâ€™s announced stress test. Some are calling it an attack on the network, however we see it as no different than someone purchasing all of the tickets on a train to have the whole train to themselves. We have spoken to multiple lawyers and the general consensus is that such a test does not violate any laws in the EU or elsewhere. 

&gt;Tomorrowâ€™s test will not occur as planned. CoinWallet.eu will not be sending a single transaction. Instead, we will be giving away over 200 Bitcoins to the community. Previous tests have involved splitting bitcoins into hundreds of thousands of tiny outputs. Now, as a gift to the community, all of the private keys that contain those outputs will be posted publicly, making the coins free for the taking. 

&gt;Here are 5 private keys, each containing 0.53918 BTC. Thousands more will be posted tomorrow.

  &gt;So I've been buying small amounts of bitcoin for 2 years now, trading on a few sites, (most of which have had sketchy moments) buying real product here and there, holding some for the long run.

&gt;But you know what? I don't understand bitcoin anymore. What the f*** is this sub talking about? I want to use it as a currency, but the constant talk here about increasing block size from 1 to 10 or 20 or 3 or 5000 or f*** all, every site I think is legit isn't, don't use this or that, do use this BUT F*** WAIT DONT!

&gt;The hell. You're telling me the whole thing could fork to whatever the hell bitcoin ""XT"" is and I'll have to keep track of that too? I just want to use bitcoin. I don't want to have to read to use my money as money.

&gt;I get that the value changes, thats normal, and I can deal with that. But the fact that all of you are making every change out to be the end of the world, guess what. I don't want any part of it anymore. You know what I don't have to do with usd or my debit or credit card? Learn new terms. Figure out if my bank is a scam tomorrow. I've got all my s*** on paper wallets now b/c as far as I'm concerned, every site is a scam, and every market is f***ed.

&gt;Yeah many of you will say I'm overreacting, and don't read enough, but if you want wide spread adoption YOU NEED STABILITY. Not 2-3 month stability, 2-3 year stability. And I'm not talking stability in price, in BASIC TERMS. The f*** are you all talking about? I've followed this s*** for 5 years now and I've officially lost track of what the arguments about. And I'm a young person who's not tech Illerate, who normally thinks they know how to explain bitcoin to people. Now I don't have any confidence as to what the f*** is going on. Are you forking again? Are you not? Is this sub cen***ed? Is everything at risk? What the f&lt;sup&gt;$#&lt;/sup&gt; is going on seriously someone explain the last 3 months to me without me having to read a god damn book about it, because while I might read it, the average currency user won't, and if you want them on board and want me to get them on board, this shit needs to be able to be explained in less than a paragraph or two.

&gt;/rant

&gt;I've had a few drinks, and I'm sick of sitting on the sidelines not knowing what the F*** is going on anymore.

&gt;Explain this shit in a paragraph. What is bitcoin in its current state. What the hell is going on. ELI5 this shit so I can still say to people, ""buy bitcoin, its worth it!"" ""you can totally use it as a currency and no your money wont be gone tomorrow!""

&gt;sorry. I like you guys.

  &gt;Is BitCoin the future of GreeceÂ´s economy?
Will the new Greek finance minister George (Giorgios) Chouliarakis try to adopt BitCoin? Is it time for the world to change and move forward? I would love to see this in my country as well.

&gt;In June/July the Grexit made the Greek run to buy lots of crypto, but now August, it was quiet. Maybe these 1,000 ATMS will make Greeks more aware and will try to invest in crypto coins.

  &gt;With the increasing number of laws and tax implications around the crypto currencies I thought I should ask the question; Are crypto currency traders using private business structures??
These structures are not very common in the usual public business space however there are lots of companies popping up which offer services in setting up/managing Private business structures.
Some benefits of the crypto currencies are that they are safe and decentralized. These benefits have been taken away by the Australian Government. If you operate business ""privately"" you are not under the governments jurisdiction therefor not subject to tax. Its a weird industry, and some of the negative population think its a scam, the reason being 1) its not common knowledge, and 2) most people when seeking ""business/tax advise"" got to an accountant. Well that's all fine and dandy however the accountants in this country a) don't know about this, or b) don't promote it because they will destroy their industry! If everyone operates privately there would be no use for accountants.
Private business structures can be set up in any industry however it would be ideal for anyone trading BTC etc. Is anyone doing this?",2015-09-09 07:06:10+00:00,cuvdabo,1,t3_3k7hm5,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I've been using this service for a while now and I simply can't fault it. I'm saving 20% every time and all the while not touching fiat. 

&gt;My biggest worry at first was confirmation times. They accept 0 confirmations - so that was no worry. Then I worried about whether the thing would work. It did. Every single time.

  &gt;I just tried to post this message as a reply to the following message from Theymos on the ""legacy"" Bitcoin forum:

&gt;Theymos, I appreciate that you do care about Bitcoin. But you simply do not have the real-world experience like Mike does, so it's starting to seem kind of surreal that you even dare to debate him.

&gt;The only reason you still even have somewhat of a major platform or bullhorn these days is because:


&gt;You got a lot of Bitcoins (although you've misappropriated the donations either to a needless software project or - worse - to buddies of yours in Hawaii, while free forum software such as reddit itself is all around you)
&gt;You got control of two of the major forums 


&gt;and that's about it. (But those are both things that fell into your lap - they don't prove any kind of competence on your part).

&gt;Meanwhile...


&gt;You don't know how to manage a large software project - you've never done that (like Mike has - at Google, and on Bitcoin itself)
&gt;You don't know how to develop a threat model including prioritizing threats - you've never done that (like Mike has done on the XT Google Group)
&gt;You don't know how to manage an open community or encourage free debate (which you've shown via your censorship tantrums and your statement that you'd be fine if ""90% of  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  users left"")
&gt;You don't understand how consensus works - ie, you don't understand consensus on the network is the only real consensus that actually exists or can exist in a real-world open-source software project - while consensus among devs is a nice-sounding phrase but ultimately a meaningless illusion which simply does not and cannot exist on an open-source project - because (as Mike has pointed out elsewhere): if a project cannot be forked, it's not open-source


&gt;Really, Theymos, you're just a kid with:


&gt;no experience coding, 
&gt;no experience managing a large software project, 
&gt;and lots of experience (and a giant FAIL) maintaining a community - since you're the person responsible for destroying  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  and running away with people's donations.


&gt;Where do you even get off trying to argue with someone Mike? You should be very thankful that he's even kind and patient enough to take the time to talk to you. (And you should realize that he probably wouldn't if you didn't happen to **own this forum** - because nobody would know who you were, because, in all honesty, your opinions about Bitcoin aren't terribly interesting or relevant in the larger scheme of things.)

&gt;Mike is talking from experience as a coder and a manager. 

&gt;Meanwhile, you're just a kid (some anonymous 22-year-old hiding behind a pseudonym, right?) who's done basically nothing involving Bitcoin programming.


&gt;Could you have changed Berkeley DB to LevelDB in the Bitcoin client like Mike did? 
&gt;Could you have written BitcoinJ like Mike did (which is the whole reason we're able to have Bitcoin clients on Android)?
&gt;Have you ever done scaling and security on a major software project at Google (as Mike has)?
&gt;Do you know to develop a threat model (as Mike has) - including the vital aspect of prioritizing threats?


&gt;You've done none of these things - and yet you continue to pontificate on this forum **which you happen to own** as if anyone really cared about your irrelevant opinions (which are downvoted to oblivion, like any other troll).

&gt;Seriously where the hell do you get off even daring to butt heads with someone like Mike, who so obviously has way more real-life experience than you in all these areas?

&gt;It must be such an ego power-trip to you know that Mike is stuck responding to you. But you need to remember: **Mike wouldn't talk to you if you were just another Redditor. The only reason you're getting all this attention is because you own a subreddit and a domain name.**

&gt;The only major projects which you have been entrusted with - applying people's donations to create a forum, and running this forum - have proven to be utter disasters.

&gt;You get downvoted to oblivion all the time these days. Fortunately, this is probably the one part of reddit which you can't get control over: our voting. 

&gt;Seriously, if you hadn't lucked into owning the names  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  and bitcointalk.org - you'd already be a nobody.

&gt;Eventually you will be a nobody - because, as outlined above, you don't know how to write code or manage a software project or maintain a community, and the majority of Bitcoin users are starting to route around you and your censorship and your damage (although you're frantically trying to hang on and avoid the inevitable by censoring the main Bitcoin forums, which you happen to own).

&gt;It's great that you have an opinion, and you certainly have a right to continue to express it and argue your points.

&gt;But word is starting to get around that you're just some 22-year-old kid from nowhere with no real-life experience writing code or managing projects (and a major fail running a forum and using donations) - enjoying your un-earned moment in the spotlight arguing against one of the biggest heavyweights in Bitcoin who's done major security and scaling projects both at Google and on Bitcoin itself - and who also has way more understanding of history and politics and society and game-theory and management and communication than you do.

&gt;Really you're just a not-very-interesting, not-very-qualified, not-very-experienced mega-troll who we simply haven't had enough time to moderate away yet. But in your mind, you're ""important"". It's all gone to your head - you've tasted power (from owning a subreddit and a domain name) and now you think you're ""somebody"".

&gt;But actually you're just a nobody. 

&gt;You've gotten way more of a platform to air your views than you would have if the playing field had been level.

&gt;You don't have a right to dominate the debate (and silence the other side of the debate) the way you've been doing. 

&gt;We're still stuck with your sticky posts and your crappy choices for moderators and your undeserved prominence for a while longer now - but we're starting to route around you.

&gt;Seriously, have you no honor or shame or decency?

&gt;Don't you feel guilty that **you** are the one who is single-handedly destroying  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin) ?

&gt;Don't you feel guilty that you're wasting so much valuable time of someone like Mike - who has much more important things to do that sitting around here debating some inexperienced kid?",2015-09-09 03:58:40+00:00,cuv9492,1,t3_3k6ve8,11,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hi guys,

&gt;Im relative new to reddit. I'm another scam victim of Igot, with 40K + owed to me. Its been that since the 6th of May, 2015 and they no longer respond.

&gt;The worst part is the reasons and timeframes they keep conveying. It started from a ""lack"" of funds from their German account, to being investigated by AUSTRAC and AML(Australian money laundering agencies) investigation, to more banking holds and then just being told to wait while they continuously go past many deadlines.

&gt;Also, when i threatened them with legal action, they subsequently changed my pending amount to a confirmed amount, yet no money was received. Literally, they don't reply for over a day, claimed they emailed me which they didn't and then change my status thinking i don't check my account. Till today, that still hasn't been received. Lies and deception once again. 

&gt;I have contacted others who have received their money, and it seems being outspoken seems to catch their attention. Igot is an exchange that holds onto  money and doesn't give them back money owed to others. ITS OUR MONEY! They don't consider the damage it does to the community and bitcoin as a whole and the industry they work in. 

&gt;I've waited over 4 months for my money, have received no replies recently, and they have done nothing but past deadlines.

&gt;I've never posted to reddit, but like many others i've read what people here have had to say. What else can one do but report them?

&gt;The fact is I hate having to beg for my own money. I have the belief that many are like that to. I would have loved to leave a message saying Igot paid out, igot did this and that. But they haven't.

&gt;Is there anyone out there that can help? or have a consistent solution? I'd like to be able to hear others peoples experiences with them, such as what they were told, what deadline they were given and other information regarding Igots refusal (or inability) to withdraw funds. I got a promise to pay 5-15th August, then 20th at the latest! not a dime came from them! ",2015-09-09 03:00:13+00:00,cuv7agh,1,t3_3k6mob,14,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I decided to make my first order on Purse.io, and my first purchase using a bitcoin merchant service altogether.
When I sent the bitcoins required for payment to my Purse escrow, it never ended up in it. Instead, the blockchain shows that my money Â« bounced Â» to another bitcoin address, then another, and so onâ€¦ ending up being merged with a lot of other btc transactions.
I doubled-checked, the address I sent my btc to is really the one displayed in my account, so Iâ€™m 100% sure I didnâ€™t screw up.

&gt;I tried to contact customer service via their inline chat service, 2 e-mails and reddit PM, but they didnâ€™t answer any of my requests within 4 business days so far.

&gt;So either the escrow address Purse gave me was compromised, either my account was (but it doesnâ€™t seem so, according to my account history, which shows no transaction).
Right now, I just feel robbed, which may indeed be the case.",2015-09-09 02:14:32+00:00,cuv5o6s,1,t3_3k6fqp,13,BitcoinAll

When there's an overflow, a **random** transaction and its children will be removed to make room.


&gt;IBLT is one of the most promising future developments to optimize block propagation. Important for reducing bandwidth requirements (particularly burst overhead), particularly under a BIP101 scenario when the block limit is increasing fast.

&gt;This software technology requires node mempools to be as synchronized as possible. If mempools vary too much in size, and particularly if many nodes are missing many random transactions, then the potential gains in using IBLT is severely compromised.

&gt;It would be better for node mempools to not limit their own size radically from the default, and also to use consistent logic to eject low-fee spam-like transactions in an overflow scenario.

&gt;Once access is given to users to configure their mempools then it is harder at a later date to roll this back when block propagation efficiencies like IBLT are needed.",2015-09-09 02:04:32+00:00,cuv5b5g,1,t3_3k6ear,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hopefully someone here knows the name. I put a couple BTC into about 2 years ago. Forget the name I would like to withdraw my funds!

&gt;The website was made for easily transferring between crypto currencies. It had a large page with all current buy and ask rates for dozens of different coins. It had a short but catchy name. They charged just a small fee on withdrawal. Any ideas?

&gt;Umm, more about it. You were able to view trading charts for all coins  [like this](https://static.incrediblecharts.com/images/png_images/sch_price_volume_spike.png)

&lt;h1&gt;Full text:&lt;/h1&gt;

&gt;Satoshi definitely intended to increase the hard max block size. See:
 [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.0) 

&gt;I believe that Satoshi expected most people to use some sort of lightweight node, with only companies and true enthusiasts being full nodes. Mike Hearn's view is similar to Satoshi's view.

&gt;I strongly disagree with the idea that changing the max block size is a violation of the ""Bitcoin currency guarantees"". Satoshi said that the max block size could be increased, and the max block size is never mentioned in any of the standard descriptions of the Bitcoin system.

&gt;IMO Mike Hearn's plan would probably work. The market/community would find a way to pay for the network's security, and it would be easy enough to become a full node that the currency wouldn't be at risk. The max block size would not truly be unlimited, since miners would always need to produce blocks that the vast majority of full nodes and other miners would be able and willing to process in a reasonable amount of time.

&gt;However, enforcing a max block size is safer. It's not totally clear that an unlimited max block size would work. So I tend to prefer a max block size for Bitcoin. Some other cryptocurrency can try the other method. I'd like the limit to be set in a more decentralized, free-market way than a fixed constant in the code, though.",2015-09-08 13:48:20+00:00,cuueb72,1,t3_3k3dqf,14,BitcoinAll

  &gt;You can store your Bitcoins in the LocalBitcoins Wallet, but we try to promote other Bitcoin wallets. Our favourite standalone Bitcoin clients are Electrum and Multibit. Paper wallets are a good idea if you want to store Bitcoin securely. Wallets on your smartphone can also be a convenient way of carrying Bitcoins around with you wherever you are. 
You can send Bitcoins to any Bitcoin address in the world from your LocalBitcoins Wallet.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pay your purchases with Bitcoins
Transfer Bitcoins to another wallet
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt;It's easy:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Go to Wallet under your user profile
Type in the receiving Bitcoin address
Type in the amount of Bitcoin you wish to send
(If you are using two-factor authentication to protect your account, you'll also need to enter the two-factor security code to transfer money out from LocalBitcoins)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt;Please note that if you are using gambling services or other services which automatically refund Bitcoins to the sender address: This feature does not work with LocalBitcoins.com web wallet. 

&gt;Transactions take between 10-60 minutes when youâ€™re sending Bitcoins to your LocalBitcoins Wallet or when your sending Bitcoins out from your LocalBitcoins Wallet. Transactions between LocalBitcoins Wallets is instantaneous.
I've waited 60 minutes and my transaction is still pending, now what? The Bitcoin network might be experiencing congestion, in this case transactions will take much longer to go through. Bitcoin transactions have to be confirmed by the Bitcoin network. When a transaction is made it gets sent into a transaction pool from where it is bundled up into 'blocks' that Bitcoin miners confirm through mining. Blocks get mined on average every ten minutes and only a finite number of transactions can fit into each block. Sometimes blocks can take much longer or much less time to mine. On rare occasions there can be several hours between successfully mined blocks. This means that the pool of unconfirmed transactions grows larger than what can fit into a single block, making it take a long time for transactions to become confirmed. Once the transaction has been included in a block and has been mined, it has been confirmed once. When the confirmation count of the transaction reaches a certain threshold, usually 3-6 confirmations, the transaction appears in the receiving wallets. You can read more about confirmations on the Bitcoin wikipedia and you can see the current number of unconfirmed transactions on the Bitcoin network here.
To check the status of your Bitcoin transaction

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;You need to know the transaction id or receiving wallet address (looks like: 1JF7RrjBzmVymz3cFeGWA7iVg3y6UXxyg) and the amount of Bitcoins transferred. On LocalBitcoins.com you can get the transaction information from your wallet transaction history after you have made the transfer
Go to blockchain.info
Type in the receiving address to the Search field
(Use the Bitcoin amount to quickly identify transactions if the receiving address has several transactions incoming)
Click the transaction to view more information about it
See how many confirmations the transaction has
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt;The results

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;More than six confirmations: the receiving wallet should have received the transaction. Please contact the provider of the receiving wallet if the transaction still does not appear in the receiving wallet.
0-6 confirmations or unconfirmed: the transaction has left the sending wallet and is still under way.
You cannot find the transaction: the transaction never left from the sending wallet. Contact the provider of the sending wallet.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt;If the receiving Bitcoin address is outside of LocalBitcoins.com service and the transaction has confirmations, please contact the provider of the receiving Bitcoin address. There isnâ€™t much we can help with for outgoing or incoming transactions, as Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Transaction fees affect how fast confirmations are registered on the Bitcoin network. LocalBitcoins.com reserves this fee from your wallet automatically. Please note that with web wallets like LocalBitcoins Wallet, you cannot make a connection with incoming and outgoing transactions of the same Bitcoin address.

  &gt;Today the confirmation time for 1 Tx is 10 min. and the average blocksize is 0.5377 Mb.
Is it right that if the average blocksize will be 2 Mb the time for 1 confirmation will need 20min. instead of 10min.?

&gt;If yes why is this a problem? Bank wires or Western Union take more than 1440min. I dont think a blocksize increase is necessary, its better creating a new currency based on Bitcoin's price.",2015-09-08 13:12:07+00:00,cuuddwz,1,t3_3k39bx,10,BitcoinAll

  &gt;We are  [SheffieldCrypto](http://sheffieldcrypto.com/) , we specialise in developing cutting edge predictive models. These â€˜smart modelsâ€™ utilize machine learning and deep neural networks, they are constantly learning and evolving given new market conditions. Currently we are applying them to various digital currency markets, the results have been very promising. We require a financial expert, specifically an expert in trading systems, to design and implement a system to utilise the signals produced by our models. please see page 2 for information regarding the models 

&gt;**Job Description**


&gt;Design and implementation of a semi-automated/automated trading system utilizing the signals produced by our models. 
&gt;Custom indicator/feature design 


&gt;**Person Specification** should be experienced or knowledgeable in 


&gt;Algorithmic trading 
&gt;Machine learning 
&gt;Natural Language processing
&gt;Market analytics 
&gt;Hedge fund operation 
&gt;System Architecture 
&gt;Feature/custom indicator design
&gt;Agile software development (CI, TDD, Scrum)
&gt;Python


&gt;**Additional Info**


&gt;We need the position filled asap 
&gt;We have access to around $30,000 in start up capital 
&gt;We will be offering equity in the company for the filled position


&gt;**Model Information and Performance**

&gt;On one simulation we tested our TA (technical analysis) algorithm with around 30 coins with shared initial parameters over a 3 month period, however many of these coins had little data (small market cap/volume), the results were as followed:

&gt;Start capital: $5,000

&gt;TA trader: $12,706

&gt;Buy and Hold: $-731.79

&gt;Random $-1,145

&gt;Buy and hold and random are included as comparisons ie how a portfolio would have performed if one was to 'buy and hold' the commodity

&gt;Another model being developed is based on NLP (natural language processing). This relies on input from social media or â€˜text dataâ€™, such bitcointalk threads, reddit, twitter etc. The semantical content is analysed and the algo finds patterns between that and price movements. We are currently working on combining the output from both algos into a deep neural network.

&gt;**Feature/custom indicator design**

&gt;Currently the TA algo utilises the output from TA-lib (a library of 150 technical indicators). The design of custom input parameters (or features as theyâ€™re known in machine learning) will allow the models to make better predictions by feeding it more relevant market data. However the priority at the moment is the design of a trading system.

&gt;**Final words**

&gt;We have 2 PhDâ€™s on our team developing these models. The models collectively have had 6 years of development (3 years/ PhD) and we are now ready to implement them into a trading scenario.

  &gt;This thread is open for discussion on block size and hard forks.

&gt;New submissions regarding block size and hard forks are not permitted at this time, so unless you have very substantial news to share, post your questions and comments here. Please read the following guidelines before proceeding:


&gt;There's a new subreddit guideline in the sidebar. It reads:


&gt;Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.

&gt;Discussing the merits and drawbacks of  [BIP 100](http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf) ,  [BIP 101](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki) ,  [BIP 102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/173/files) , Pieter Wuille's  [BIP ???](https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6)  and other proposals is encouraged.
&gt;Themes regarding hard forks in general, such as what happens when they occur, how to ensure the fork is successful, and how the bitcoin network can react to hard forks which are potentially hostile, are open for discussion.
&gt;Avoid personal attacks and emotionally charged arguments.
&gt;No meta discussion.
&gt;Stay on topic.


&gt;There's been a lot of great discussion so far. Let's avoid falling back into voting cliques. They harm the discussion and will have no impact on the outcome of this debate. 


**Don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.",2015-09-08 11:03:24+00:00,cuub07t,1,t3_3k2wnt,19,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I've seen a few posts by small-block supporters (e.g.  [luke-jr](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3jyl1i/september_07_2015_block_size_and_hard_fork_dialog/cutr367) ,  [110101002](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3jyl1i/september_07_2015_block_size_and_hard_fork_dialog/cutjloj) ) claiming that 4 MB is larger than the network could handle securely today. So far, we've been making theoretical arguments back and forth with no success. Ultimately, it's an empirical question, not a theoretical one. Perhaps we should just implement an 8 MB network and see how it goes?

&gt;Here's what I propose:

&gt;We set up a testnet-style altcoin that can be merge-mined with Bitcoin Core. The new coin will be almost identical to bitcoin's testnet, with a few differences:

&lt;ol&gt;
8 MB blocks will be permitted immediately. 
16 MB blocks will be permitted in 2017 (1 year before BIP101).
32 MB blocks will be permitted in 2018, and the permitted blocksize schedule will be 2x what is permitted by BIP101 then and thereafter.
Block rewards increase over time, doubling every 4 years instead of halving: let nobody mistake this for an economic challenge to Bitcoin.
If possible, merged mining support would help a lot with testing the mining infrastructure. I know merged mining would require a fair amount of code to be written (or copied from Namecoin), but I think it would be worth it. It would be especially helpful if the merged mining could be done using two different servers, so that the main bitcoind mining process could be isolated from resource contention in the 8 MB process to whatever extent the pool or mining farm operator desires.
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;The new coin would need a name. Please make suggestions below. Here are three probably bad ideas:

&lt;ol&gt;
POCcoin, for proof-of-concept
BIPcoin, for BIP101
Eightcoin
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;As a medium-size miner, I would be willing to support the testing of this project with a dedicated server, about 400 TH/s of merged mining, and possibly a dedicated 100 Mbps fiber line. If we can convince a few of the other major pools (especially in China) to put up a server for this project, we can set up a test network to see what limitations there are when trying to scale to 8 MB blocks. If we can fix all of those issues (or see that they are easily fixed by the financial incentives of an actual mining network), then it should be easier to convince people to go for BIP101.

&gt;In order to make this happen, we'd need at least one good programmer behind it. Any volunteers?

&gt;Any reason why this would be a bad idea?",2015-09-08 07:19:13+00:00,cuu7wmm,1,t3_3k2f00,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Do legal frameworks such as the New York bitlicense cover the requirements to register as MSBs when bitcoin is used as a guarantor or deposit for a loan, that is contractually agreed to be repaid in cash?

&gt;For instance:

&gt;Someone wants to borrow $240, so the loan company says that they can, but as a guarantee they need to deposit 1 BTC which they will receive back after the loan is repaid. They provide them with Bank details, and allow for repayments on a daily/monthly basis.

&gt;Would this require a bit license?",2015-09-08 06:54:39+00:00,cuu7i1h,1,t3_3k2cwd,5,BitcoinAll

Today I successfully got my permanent ban by posting this:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3k2acn/please_ban_me_from_rbitcoin_ive_started_a_new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3k2acn/please_ban_me_from_rbitcoin_ive_started_a_new/) 

&gt;Here is confirmation:  [http://i.imgur.com/pXG3Uxp.png](http://i.imgur.com/pXG3Uxp.png) 

&gt;Now, I can move forward without ever looking back!  I started a brand new uncensored Bitcoin + Altcoin subreddit here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinbeyond/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinbeyond/) 

&gt;It will be completely uncensored.  There will be no other moderators besides me, and I won't do a thing or lift a finger, as far as moderation is concerned.  I trust the community to downvote bad content, including bad content posted by me.

&gt;I love Bitcoin, and I love several Altcoins (Ethereum, Litecoin, REP, to name a few).  We are all adults, and I feel that we should be able to intelligently discuss Bitcoin, any Altcoin, or any other crypto-currency topic that we feel like discussing.  So if you like the concept, please feel free to add Bitcoin Beyond to your subscription list, and I welcome you to post to it as well.

  &gt;Thomas Sowell released in 1987  [an interesting book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Conflict_of_Visions) . It is in my opinion describing nicely a conflict similar to the conflict between the two Bitcoin camps. I think that if you want to study the situation then this book provides a good insight.

&gt;I will try to describe few ideas from the book here but I am not a native speaker nor a good speaker/writer so get an audiobook or read it for yourself.

&gt;Thomas is noticing that throughout the history of mankind there are two interesting camps of people very often opposing each other. The same people stand on the opposing sides of different issues too often for it to be a random coincidence. He then tries to identify what is driving this two camps and then shows how the two camps easily come to opposite conclusions because they start out their thinking from opposite premises. Thomas then describes how this happens in many different situations over and over again.

&gt;I personally think that the current XT/Core situation is another example of this conflict.

&gt;Some Ideas from XT camp:


Knowledge is mainly spread out. Public discussion are important and bring ideas forward.
Everybody can fork codebase and blockchain whenever they wish and the people will then use whatever is better for them. Forking is healthy for Bitcoin.
We cannot find perfect solutions to problems, only compromises. Find perfect solutions block any progress we can make.
We should take an inspiration from the past. It is possible that some of the important knowledge they had in past is probably lost already.


&gt;Some ideas from Core camp:


Individual knowledge attained by experts is far greater than the knowledge of the masses. Public discussion is worthless compared to discussions in expert groups.
Forking of Core is a blasphemy as who could know any better than the actual experts working on core.
If the experts think hard they can find out solutions to most hard problems.
There is no reason to dwell on past. We know much more now that we knew back then we can make better decisions now.


&gt;This ideas seem to me very aligned with the two visions Thomas is describing in the book.",2015-09-08 05:11:28+00:00,cuu5jg6,1,t3_3k23tu,10,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I think CCTV should be in place here because i work with lots of criminals (supported housing unit). However i think the CCTV should only be reviewed when an incident occurred as nobody here wants to feel like they are being watched by their boss for 12 hours solid. You can never properly relax and it makes you more self-conscious definitely. 

&gt;What crossed my mind is the possibility that instead of a multi-sig wallet and the co-signing of a payment by employees, could there be away to make it so all the staff (here there are 5) need to have input to review footage on a monitor? Or at least make it so all staff receive a notification when the management are reviewing footage?

&gt;Maybe CCTV systems already exist that require multiple keys (physical) to do this but i'm not aware of them. ",2015-09-08 01:44:13+00:00,cutzov4,1,t3_3k1guw,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Are we seeing the initial enthusiasm about BIP100 begin to fade as people think through the implications of giving miners full control of network capacity. Watching many of them ""vote"" for giving themselves more control, even as the issues were being discussed, was perhaps enlightening.

&gt;Is it time to see this issue as not quite so complex: The decision today is not how big do we want the network to **be**; rather, it is how big would we like it to possibly become.

&gt;Raising the blocksize doesn't magically cause the blocks to be filled. (Don't even start with the spam...blocks would already be full.) Miner's have always had and used the power to make blocks smaller than the limit. Any games they can play will get played; whatever the blocksize.

&gt;The only thing that's crystal clear is that the capacity can never exceed what's imposed by the size limit.

&gt;So stop thinking of it as a limit. Think of it as a statement of how big you'd like to aim for.

&gt;And then we can get back to work making it happen.",2015-09-07 23:45:14+00:00,cutw130,1,t3_3k11sn,9,BitcoinAll

&gt;I did the randomization it generated a new address I saved the public address and sent some coins to that public address, in the  next minute or so I hit ""generate new address"" by accident and it created a new wallet. I didn't save the private address but already sent the coins to that wallet. Is there any way to retrieve the previous address data? Is it saved in RAM anywhere or perhaps in the java?

  &gt;Hello I have an idea

&gt;The Singularity is very near.

&gt;Just imagine: 1 world-wide open-source voting system based on the bitcoin blockchain. Kinda like Kickstarter.


Every human or artificial intelligent system could vote
Available on every mobile device with some sort of Touch ID
Available in every language
Every human or AI system can freely post ideas
Results are immediately available and update live on the fly
This voting system is available on any device with some sort of touch id
You can vote multiple times. 1 vote costs 2 satoshiâ€™s
1 for the owner of the idea
1 for the voting system itself
The idea-owner decides his next step
People who canâ€™t afford a smartphone can somehow get a free one paid for by the voting system (not 100% sure how this could work), with a couple prepaid satoshi's
This voting system will absorb idea's from concurring systems.


&gt;How would this work in Africa?
Public voting booths with Touch ID entrance and free prepaid satoshiâ€™s?

&gt;My wish is to be an adviser for this system as Iâ€™m not a programmer, Iâ€™m a designer.

&gt;Math geniuses of the world, we need you.

&gt;My bitcoin adress is

  &gt;This will probably get downvoted but I don't think I'm alone. I thought the support BitcoinXT had was way bigger because of so many people praising it on  [/r/Bitcoin](/r/Bitcoin) . I wanted to help scale bitcoin so I spent about $200 to set up 10 BitcoinXT nodes for a month. My nodes were all running smoothly for the past 3 weeks. I didn't get any DDOS or anything like that but the month is almost over and I will not renew any BitcoinXT nodes because the miners refuse to use it. The record was only 8 blocks out of 1000. It will be impossible mine 750 blocks in one week because over 70% of miners already support another BIP. Now I think there must be a good reason why they won't run BitcoinXT and people are just gaming  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  with fake voting to make it look like there is support, just like they're gaming the XT nodes website. The $200 I spent was almost 1/3 of my bitcoin savings and I regret wasting my money on this.

  &gt;The first item in  [BIP 100's](https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100/blob/master/bip-0100.mediawiki)  ""motivation"" section is:


&gt;Long term, wean the bitcoin protocol away from any block size limit; let the free market establish a natural size limit equilibrium.


&gt;In his PDF, there is a lot of rhetoric about the free market:


&gt;This change moves from centralized management of the fee market to freeÂ­market control, improving bitcoinâ€™s governance by removing a hardcoded policy control from the software

&gt;A key goal, therefore, is to transition the speed limit from software control to market control. Remove the policy wedge. Let the free market decide the long term shape of bitcoinâ€™s transaction fee market, level of security and level of decentralization.


&gt;The problem is that BIP 100 doesn't actually put the block size under free market control.

&gt;Wikipedia defines a free market as:


&gt;a market economy system in which the prices for goods and services are set freely by consent between vendors and consumers, in which the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority.


&gt;In BIP 100, supply (of block space) is not free from intervention because it is being controlled by a cartel.

&gt;A free market would be a situation where there is no max block size at all, but this is likely not desirable because such a market has many externalities. 

&gt;First, miners don't bear the direct  [costs to the network](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Against_large_blocks#Transactions_have_negative_externalities_which_higher_fees_keep_in_check)  of including a transaction. They also don't bear the full  [costs to decentralization](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Against_large_blocks#Decentralization)  that large blocks could pose. Miners also don't bear the full  [costs to growth](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/For_large_blocks#Growth)  of blocks that are too small.

&gt;**TLDR: BIP 100 claims to put block size under control of a free market but puts it under control of a cartel instead.**",2015-09-07 20:27:02+00:00,cutr9si,1,t3_3k0fox,29,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hi! I'm very new to bitcoin. I don't really have much experience in it and am trying to get around the headache of using a wallet and get into this. Nearly every FAQ suggests CoinBase, but, CoinBase requires you to wait 7 days? 

&gt;Is this normal for Bitcoin, to wait seven days before you can use the funds for anything? Coinbase required me to use my bank account, won't even let me use a debit/credit card. I canceled at the last second because it told me my funds wouldn't be available until September 14th. I find this wait to be unacceptable.

&gt;Does anyone else have any other recommendations and any tips that are broken down for dummies, like me? ",2015-09-07 19:55:00+00:00,cutqh34,1,t3_3k0c65,11,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Thanks to Bitcoin, I've personally been unbanked since 2013. It recently occurred to me that no single definitive resource exists that lists all the fantastic ways a person can fly, rent, shop, remit, save, communicate, and invest without using a bank account.

&gt;I've purchased the domain Unbanked.xyz to create this resource. I intend it to be not only a one-stop place to learn how to live on crypto, but also to be a continuously publishing blog (think clickworthy posts like ""10 Reasons to Ditch Your Bank Account"", ""8 Ways to Save Money Using Bitcoin"", etc.) I'm a blogger, and so will write all the content myself.

&gt;I'm familiar with Wordpress and can certainly navigate it on my own, but I fear that its basic pre-built templates would be insufficient for Unbanked.xyz's navigational needs.

&gt;So here's my ask: would anyone here be willing to donate a handful of hours to customize a web design for me, which I can then populate into The Crypto Economy's Most Useful Guide? I'm also very open to just being pointed to pre-built templates which you think would serve the purpose.

&gt;Thank you. Please private message me.",2015-09-07 19:11:48+00:00,cutp3b0,1,t3_3k067b,7,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I know it's hard to imagine that we would ever go censor-crazy the way  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  did, but imagine the following:

&gt;In addition to anti-XT trolls that spew invective, we also get a flood of self-promoting trolls (advertising scams, etc.)
&gt;The well intentioned mods start to get exasperated and instead of thinking deeply about each post to be removed, start using mental shortcuts (""well, if it's an altcoin, it should be removed"")
&gt;Some reasonably contentious issue comes up that feels like ""obviously a scam/bad-idea"" to some and ""reasonable"" to others, overworked mods end up removing an issue that perhaps ought to be discussed... and keep in mind at this point there are legions of sock puppet accounts

  &gt;The topic is a strong statement alone. With this post I wan't you to share my personal opinion on what the 'Killer App' of the Blockchain really is. For those who don't know the term 'Technological Singularity' it's worth a moment to check Wikipedia:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) 

&gt;**In short:** It's the theory that at a certain point in time technological invention will accelerate itself so dramatically that the future of humanity becomes unpredictable after this event. This thesis was first claimed by 'John von Neumann' 1958 and later adopted by a number of accredited scientists. Also leading into the definition of 'Moores Law' 1965. In particular the singularity may happen spontaneously without notice even by the ones directly involved in it's creation. 

&gt;A lot of people think of this event as something bad. I.e machines will start to rule over humans like in the movie Terminaor. But there's also the ones, like me, that say humans can stay in control and use the technology for good purpose.

&gt;**So what has Bitcoin or the Blockchain to do with all this?**
It's about Bitcoin's economic incentive to build even faster computing machines. It has been been proven by reality that the (still stupid) SHA256 computing power of Bitcoin's Blockchain exceeds everything humans have invented before, combined, by magnitudes. And this was in 2013!:  [https://tradeblock.com/blog/bitcoin-network-8-times-faster-than-top-500-super-computers-combined](https://tradeblock.com/blog/bitcoin-network-8-times-faster-than-top-500-super-computers-combined)  

&gt;As the price of Bitcoin rises, so will the computing power of the underlying network. The existence of Satoshi Nakamoto's invention will soon create an economic incentive so strong to build optical and maybe quantum CPU's that will boost technological development in a manner humans have not experienced before. The technical feasibility of optical CPU's is already proven in laboratories around the world. The only thing that is currently missing is: money. So we are all part of building the missing pieceâ€¦

&gt;Notice: Sure there institutions like intelligence agencies that have a huge budget. But I think that even the NSA cannot easily put 500Bil$ into a specialized project. I think Bitcoin is the missing piece here that will make this technology not even possible but publicly available.",2015-09-07 18:40:45+00:00,cuto4dl,1,t3_3k022n,12,BitcoinAll

  &gt;We are  [SheffieldCrypto](http://sheffieldcrypto.com/) , we specialise in developing cutting edge predictive models. These â€˜smart modelsâ€™ utilize machine learning and deep neural networks, they are constantly learning and evolving given new market conditions. Currently we are applying them to various digital currency markets, the results have been very promising. We require a financial expert, specifically an expert in trading systems, to design and implement a system to utilise the signals produced by our models. please see page 2 for information regarding the models 

&gt;**Job Description**


&gt;Design and implementation of a semi-automated/automated trading system utilizing the signals produced by our models. 
&gt;Custom indicator/feature design 


&gt;**Person Specification** should be experienced or knowledgeable in 


&gt;Algorithmic trading 
&gt;Machine learning 
&gt;Natural Language processing
&gt;Market analytics 
&gt;Hedge fund operation 
&gt;System Architecture 
&gt;Feature/custom indicator design
&gt;Agile software development (CI, TDD, Scrum)
&gt;Python


&gt;**Additional Info**


&gt;We need the position filled asap 
&gt;We have access to around $30,000 in start up capital 
&gt;We will be offering equity in the company for the filled position


&gt;**Model Information and Performance**

&gt;On one simulation we tested our TA (technical analysis) algorithm with around 30 coins with shared initial parameters over a 3 month period, however many of these coins had little data (small market cap/volume), the results were as followed:

&gt;Start capital: $5,000

&gt;TA trader: $12,706

&gt;Buy and Hold: $-731.79

&gt;Random $-1,145

&gt;Buy and hold and random are included as comparisons ie how a portfolio would have performed if one was to 'buy and hold' the commodity

&gt;Another model being developed is based on NLP (natural language processing). This relies on input from social media or â€˜text dataâ€™, such bitcointalk threads, reddit, twitter etc. The semantical content is analysed and the algo finds patterns between that and price movements. We are currently working on combining the output from both algos into a deep neural network.

&gt;**Feature/custom indicator design**

&gt;Currently the TA algo utilises the output from TA-lib (a library of 150 technical indicators). The design of custom input parameters (or features as theyâ€™re known in machine learning) will allow the models to make better predictions by feeding it more relevant market data. However the priority at the moment is the design of a trading system.

&gt;**Final words**

&gt;We have 2 PhDâ€™s on our team developing these models. The models collectively have had 6 years of development (3 years/ PhD) and we are now ready to implement them into a trading scenario.

  &gt;Have been wanting to try it out and finally did.  Worked really well, connection was almost instantaneous and had better connection quality than my own cell phone.  I was just calling locally so haven't tried it overseas but overall I thought it was great first try.

&gt;It's still in Beta and not many features but I'm pretty impressed.  Can't wait until we can use our cell phones like this and just pay for what we use rather than having wasteful monthly plans.

  &gt;Iâ€™m proud to say that  [Cryptowatch](https://cryptowat.ch)  is growing up today. Weâ€™ve released a big update which transforms our service from a read-only charting platform into a functional trading platform. For now itâ€™s compatible with 4 exchanges: Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTC-e, and Kraken. We will soon be adding more.

&gt;The goal behind Cryptowatch has always been to build the best trading software we can. Traders generally use separate software for charting and order execution. This is clunky and makes you keep a lot of stuff in your head. We think merging the two makes a lot of sense. So we started with charts, and now weâ€™re taking the next step. We think we've designed an interface that makes trading more intuitive, consistent, and fun.

&gt;Some demos:


 [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/V69VoNd.png) 
 [Screencapture](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cryptowatch-external-assets/trading.html) 


&gt;This new part of the product is a paid extension. We're pricing it at $30/month. It's free to try for 14 days with no payment information required. And of course we accept Bitcoin.

&gt;We're launching it with spot trading support only; margin trading is not possible yet. Adding margin trading is basically the next thing on our list. It will require some extra work on the UI.

&gt;These new features are completely optional; you donâ€™t have to keep it open if you just want to use our charts the same way as before. We havenâ€™t removed anything from the free charting service.

&gt;There are also more minor updates:


Weâ€™ve added multi-factor authentication using the  [TOTP standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)  (Google Authenticator, basically). We recommend everyone with an account uses it. You can enable it at  [https://cryptowat.ch/account/security](https://cryptowat.ch/account/security) 
We're tracking logins and other account activity. You can find it in the new â€œSecurityâ€ section
The decimal places in the interface better reflect the precision with which the various exchanges display their prices


&gt;As usual, this release was tested thoroughly but Iâ€™m sure there are still bugs. Please report them when you see them: PM me here or email  [admin@cryptowat.ch](mailto:admin@cryptowat.ch) . We will be fixing things as soon as they come up.

&gt;On a more personal note, now that weâ€™re opening ourselves up as a business I think itâ€™s important to understand who we are. Cryptowatch is built by a very small software company based in New York. Weâ€™ve chosen to remain completely bootstrapped (no venture capital) so our operating costs are very low and we donâ€™t have to answer to any outside pressure. Weâ€™ve chosen to keep our business model simple: sell good software to people who value it. Pay for our product and in return we will give you the best trading experience we can. We will never hassle you with ads or sell your data to outside parties. We just want to make good software.

&gt;Thanks! Happy Labor Day.

&gt;Artur

&gt;Founder, Cryptowatch

  &gt;It would be nice to make this power formal and explicit. For example, miners could publish in their blocks something like:


&gt;I will only mine on top of blocks of size &gt; X, if at least k other blocks were mined on top of them.


&gt;For example, if someone mines a 10MB block, I will ignore it unless at least one more block was mined on top of it. This way an effective limit is determine by the risk that a block will be orphaned, and we don't need any weird voting protocol built into Bitcoin, except to agree on a way to share intent. Then we can simple remove the blocksize limit completely.",2015-09-07 07:32:30+00:00,cut9jen,1,t3_3jy5e3,7,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hey everyone,
I was just wondering if anyone from the community can recommend a place to buy Bitcoins via either PayPal or credit card. I own an armory wallet so I want to be able to deposit by Bitcoins into that wallet instead of keep them on a server associated with the site that I buy from. So far all the exchanges I've seen have looked like scams or have required me to make several purchases or hold an account for a certain period of time before making decent Bitcoin purchases. I would really appreciate if someone could recommend a website that they have used to buy Bitcoins with PayPal or with a credit card from so that I can be confident that the site will work.
Thanks to everyone who helps me out!  ",2015-09-07 07:11:48+00:00,cut96s5,1,t3_3jy3pl,14,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hey guys,

&gt;We collect data from top exchangers and provide users with an overall average rate. Data collection is done every 10 minutes. 

&gt;In addition to this, we allow users to ""get the best rate"" at any moment in time, in 5 foreign currencies. 

&gt;We also feature a ticker API that developers can use if they so wish. 

&gt;Please remember that this app is still in beta, so any and all feedback is greatly appreciated. We wish to hopefully target the ""non-techy"" market, allowing for people who have no previous knowledge about bitcoin and virtual currencies in general, to get started with the concept.",2015-09-07 04:49:11+00:00,cut678q,1,t3_3jxqy7,9,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hello  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  and I will thank you in advance for any help you many grant to me.

&gt;I made a purchase earlier today on bitstickers.net (They have great prices) and I bought $6.81 in cryptocurrency stickers after shipping. I was redirected to coinpayments.net where the intuitive design was easy to navigate. I was given 3 hours to submit my payment, which I did, but here is where I fucked up.

&gt;I had to re index my wallet. And I was still 7 weeks away from everything being synchronized. I sent the Bitcoin to the address provided but the transaction is stated as being offline. Bitcoin was taken out of my wallet though. 

&gt;I go to the website and they still show my stuff as not being purchased. So any thing I could do to figure this out? Did the transaction somehow go through? Should I just contact the company? 

&gt;Thanks again for any help or advice. Have an enjoyable night.",2015-09-07 03:29:07+00:00,cut45ni,1,t3_3jxir8,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hello!
I've been using bitcoin for some time now but have been buying them through the exchanges/local traders. Now I'd like to get part of my salary in bitcoin, and was thinking of using Bitwage to do so.

&gt;I have a few questions regarding Bitwage before I sign up and give my employer the account info...

&gt;1- I am l located in Canada, and will be paid in Canadian dollars, this is OK? Is the bank account number that I will get from Bitwage a US account number? I'm not sure if my employer is able to do the direct deposit to a US account, is there any way I can get a Canadian account number/transit code from Bitwage?

&gt;2- When setting up my account, it asked for the payment processor or something similar. I think they are paying it via direct deposit with their bank, so can I just write ""direct deposit"" and as the URL give the employer's website URL again?

&gt;As for the bitcoin debit cards, I've seen a few, with the most popular looking to be Xapo. The problem with Xapo (and others I've checked) is that there is a 3% fee to use the card in another currency than USD. I would be spending in CAD (since I'm in Canada) and wouldn't want any fee to do so. Are there any Canadians out there who can suggest a bitcoin debit card similar to how Xapo works (converts BTC -&gt; fiat on the fly, when the purchase is made) and without the 3% fee on every 'foreign currency' purchase?

&gt;&lt;code&gt;stratum+tcp://71.58.72.67:9332 -u YOURBITCOINADDRESS -p x&lt;/code&gt;and don't forget to set a failover pool with &lt;code&gt;--failover 198.71.92.235:9332 -u YOURBITCOINADDRESS -p x&lt;/code&gt; for example :)  (That's  [/u/heldertb](/u/heldertb) 's XT p2pool on west coast US).

&gt;Set up your own p2pool node here  [http://p2pool.in/](http://p2pool.in/)  (it's easier than you think, promise!), the more there are the harder to DoS us all.

  &gt;First of all sorry for the bad English. Secondly. I tried to contact Aaron Voisin - programmer of breadwallet. But could not reach him. I used breadwallet a few times but now I cant access my empty wallet anymore because I have lost my passcode and recovery phrase. I dont mind that because its empty so I want to start a new one but when I delete the application - remove and reinstall - the application still have my old data in it while the iOS popups; when delete this application you remove all personal data do you continue? Well.. Nothing happend still have my personal data when deleting. Please help! How can I start a new wallet? It seems to be a bug. ",2015-09-06 17:10:55+00:00,cuslpz2,1,t3_3jvh5w,4,BitcoinAll

&gt;Saturation: 11% (C = 8.9 Ã— T)

&gt;**Notes**

&gt;[0] The average transaction size seems to have been near 500 bytes for most of the time since 2010 at least.  

&gt;[1] The actual capacity of the network was revealed during the ""stress tests"" in early July, when the queues had a backlog that peaked at 200 MB (400'000 tx) and lasted for several days.  The capacity is only 700 kB/block, not 1 MB/block, because miners often output empty or partially empty blocks, even when the queues are full.  It is assumed that the capacity was the same in 2010, although the actual traffic never reached 2% of it.

&gt;[2] The clearance determines (a) how hard it is to create a persistent backlog on the queues, due either to natural traffic surges (at peak hours and days, or random fluctuations) or to malicious spam attacks; and (b) how fast a backlog is cleared after the traffic T returns to its normal average value.

&gt;[3] Actually 2300 tx/day was a peak demand observed in three short periods during 2010.  Except for those peaks the demand was about 400 tx/day by the end of 2010.

&gt;[4] Those predictions for 2016 assume that the average demand will continue to rise linearly by 5000 tx/day every month,as it seems to have been doing over the last 12 months (when it grew from 60'000 to 120'000 tx/day).   If the growth were to be exponential rather than linear -- i.e., doubling every 12 months -- then the demand would be 150'000 tx/day (75% saturation) by Dec/2015, and 180'000 (90% saturation) by Mar/2016.  Since the demand varies strongly with the day of the week (Â± 15% or more) and with the hour of day (Â± 30% or more), recurrent traffic jams, lasting several hours each, are expected to occur well before the network reaches 100% saturation.

&gt;[5] Assuming that the percentage of empty and partiually empty blocks, in a persistent backlog condition, will be about the same as seen in the recent stress tests.",2015-09-06 16:55:30+00:00,cusl8nz,1,t3_3jvf86,9,BitcoinAll

I'm a newbie BTCer and have been trying all day to buy BTC from the most reputable company I could find (Coinbase).  It took many tries to get my ID verified, but they finally let me buy $50 worth...  Wow.  I'm up for Investor of the Month.  Anyway, I would really like to buy more (safely) while we're still in the $250 range, and I was hoping I could get some advice from the vets around here on where to go (I'm in the US).

  &gt;We disabled the TotesMessenger bot a few weeks ago because it was getting reported a lot and didn't seem to contribute to the content of the subreddit.

&gt;However, now we're wondering about the auto submission bots like ""BitcoinXPostBot"" and (I'm fairly sure it's a bot) ""BitcoinNewsie.""

&gt;It seems like a ton of the submissions are coming from these two accounts, basically mirroring content from  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin) . It seems like they may be discouraging participation on  [/r/bitcoinxt](/r/bitcoinxt)  and causing the identity of this subreddit to be less unique, essentially turning us into an echo chamber for  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin) .

  &gt;I've upgraded my account to a Business account, and when I go to create buttons, I don't see anywhere to allow me to accept Bitcoin with the buttons I'm able to create.

&gt;When I do a Google search for:

&gt;'site:paypal.com ""accept bitcoin""', I see 2 results. [1]

&gt;Neither pages seem to help.

&gt;If you've been able to get this working, could you please provide some guidance.

&gt;-Thanks.

  &gt;Not looking for upvotes here, just advice...

&gt;My friend runs a small e-cig shop in Toronto and wants to start accepting bitcoin.  I have a feeling there's some crossover between the bitcoin and vaping demographics so I think this could be a good move for him... Might bring in some new customers.

&gt;He plans on converting any BTC revenue into fiat, so a service like Bitpay is probably ideal.  Is Bitpay still the go-to for this type of thing or is there a better alternative?

  &gt;Hi,

&gt;I have free electric and I want to know what the best path to take is if I want to get into mining, my reason for which would be solely to make a profit. If I won't make one unless bitcoin doubles or triples, I'll stay likely out.

&gt;Is something like this a good idea?  [http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814195129&amp;cm_re=firepro_w9000-_-14-195-129-_-Product](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814195129&amp;cm_re=firepro_w9000-_-14-195-129-_-Product)

  &gt;As you might have guessed by the title, I am not the most informed member of this sub. I know running bitcoin mining on some shit hardware is just not worth the effort. However, how about running it on 30+ average computers [I actually don't know the specifications on them, they are some 2-3 year old, middle of the line HPs].

&gt;I have these computers that are maybe used for a max 50 days every year. They just sit there and do nothing the rest of the year.

  &gt;Been reading some articles about adoption and how it is necessary to get a wider audience. Lets face it the doldrums have kicked in. Back in the day one of the exciting aspects was mining, now you have to be a large outfit to participate with the expectation of reward, which in its self has gotten tough. So we need some new ideas! I got one.....Light bulb went off in my head! What if you could design a light bulb or small appliance that would add to the hash rate of the network. This unit would be tied to a service that would also automatically create an account with wallet service. Your reward would be no transaction fees for using your wallet, I know pretty much that way now.....But to entice the new users just maybe the thought of reward and simplicity could create an itch...Now I know the device would have to consume very little energy...but if you could get enough people on board
Decentralization baby! Success will rely on the fact that grandma could set it up easy than an email account. You get where I am going ....but also remember this is dumblar......Ha ha",2015-09-05 23:56:14+00:00,curznjr,1,t3_3jswrc,12,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Block size would be governed by equation:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;maximumBlockSize = floor(1000000 * 1.05^n)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt;Today, n = 0 giving the current maximumBlockSize.

&gt;Every 2016 blocks, in line with the difficulty adjustment:

&gt;Find the median block size in the past 2016 block period.
This would be the mean average of blocks 1008 and 1009 when the 2016 blocks are arranged in size order.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (median &gt; 60% of maximumBlockSize)
    n = n + 1
else if (median &lt; 40% of maximumBlockSize)
    if (n &gt; 0) n = n - 1  // n must always be at least 0
else
    n remains the same
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


The maximum block size would always be at least 1000000 bytes since n &gt;= 0.
If the block size were to change it would be by 5% in an adjustment period.
If it were to change in every adjustment period it could change by a factor of 3.56 per year at most, assuming 26 adjustment periods per year and every adjustment in the same direction.
It only changes upwards when blocks are becoming more full and is also able to scale down.
Technically, miners control the block size since the size of the past 2016 blocks is determined by the transactions they choose to include (still incentivising transaction fees).
Miners wouldn't want to create blocks larger than are able to efficiently propagate, keeping block sizes appropriate to the available bandwidth.",2015-09-05 23:21:52+00:00,curyn4e,1,t3_3jsstb,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;So i bought like 1.59 BTC on a danish exchanger, all is cool, i registered a Bitcoin Core wallet since it popped first on google.

&gt;i downloaded it and gave them the address, and they send the money

&gt;Now problem is that i need to sync 3 years, and after 8 hours i am now 20% in... I tried downloading a Bootstrap.dat and insert it in %appdata% but doesnt seem like Bitcoin Core likes to import that file.

&gt;Is there anyway i can sync it faster? The BTC isnt even showing and is unspendable?

  &gt;I just had the worst first experience ever through LibertyX. First I drove to 2 locations yesterday that supposedly participate according to their website but no longer do. After over an hour of driving I go to the third and purchase $300 and $50 PINs with cash. 

&gt;I tried to redeem them later that night but didn't realize that their receipts only printed out the confirmation ID instead of the 12 digit PIN's. I didn't know any better as it was my first time. So I drove all the way back to the store and waited over 2 hours while they had to call QPay and play phone tag while sending e-mail to their managers. I finally got the PINs but now I'm locked out of my account while they are apparently closed for the holiday weekend. I really hope they are able to refund me the $350 or somehow apply it to my account. All in all this is the worst experience I've had.. ",2015-09-05 22:27:10+00:00,curx0d1,1,t3_3jsmcv,14,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I wanted to invest my btc just to try it out. First time was some time ago when i bought haslets at Gaw miners. But this seemed to slow and i couldn't really calculate when it would pay of, so i got out early with almost no loss (after spending around $5000+ in different haslets), which turned out to be the best thing ever after it turned into a scam or ponzi scheme 6 months later. (I feel bad for those who lost a lot of money)

&gt;But then I found btcjam and bitlendingclub, but after trying for a few weeks, its just to slow and time consuming (btcjam auto invest is terrible and invest terrible, and bitlendingclub requires sitting long periods of time just choosing people to lend out very small amounts to)..
I have also just started trying to use bitfinex swap trading, investing/lending out $261 as a start, and now after 2 weeks have made a whole $1! (wow - yawn).

&gt;What are some alternatives you guys use? I wouldn't mind trying cloud mining again, if it was trustworthy and not just unseen (aka non existing) server parks as with gaw miners.
I'm just not to thrilled about buying and selling bitcoins as this haven't given me much luck previous. I would rather just lend out and only get profit :)",2015-09-05 19:57:33+00:00,cursfg8,1,t3_3js2o5,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I Am a middleschooler who is interested in bitcoin. There is one guy in my class who's brother mined early and has a lot and he will pay people to do stuff. I sold him some stuff and made him a website and he paid me using a paper wallet (it looked like a dollar but with mlp, and a part that you fold down to see the key, lol).
At lunch I was showing a teacher, they thought it was really cool, and wanted to know more. BUT THEN! a little later I was told to speak to the principal and they made me give them the paper wallet and said it was ""gambling"" and wouldn't give it back!
Is there anything I can do!? I'm freaking out! .3BC is probably not a lot to you but it was to me!!! Is there anything I can do to make him give it back!? is it even legal to take? Why is it gambling!?",2015-09-05 19:25:00+00:00,currf7k,1,t3_3jryk4,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;We have had quite a bit of time to think up what would the the the use case that would bring in more adopters. People have mentioned things like international remittances, micro transactions, self-banking for the bankless, decentralisation of the ledger, low transaction fees etc.

&gt;All of these are good, but I think right now there can be nothing more appealing than bitcoin being a safe haven against inflation and capital controls.

  &gt;Title pretty much says it. 

&gt;I'm researching this and most dev tools I can find rely on a third party which to me is anti-Bitcoin.

&gt;Anyone here have the tech experience to directly tell me that me whether or not running a full node is critical to accepting Bitcoin without a third party?  I don't need to know how (although I'd like to) as much as I'd like to know if it's even possible 

&gt;(My reason for this question is a full node takes quite a lot of server overhead which which can be quite expensive for a start up website that may or may not make money)

&gt;Requirements:


Different payment address for every transaction
able to update how many confirmations
Able to resend from unique payment address (in bullet one) to another address (my actual wallet)",2015-09-05 15:41:12+00:00,curkff1,1,t3_3jr5cn,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;So I replied to a Craigslist ad for a  [forklift in PA](http://lancaster.craigslist.org/hvo/5164980116.html) .  Which shares the same photos as this Ebay  [forklift in FL](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2006-TOYOTA-FORKLIFT-5000-LBS-DUAL-FUEL-PNEUMATIC-TIRES-LOW-2738-HRS-/221863437171) .

&gt;The Craigslist seller is now telling me (via email only) that he and the forklift are in Utah, and he's already paid for shipping (up to 500 miles) so he'll arrange shipping.  All I have to do is buy 14 bitcoins and deposit into his wallet.  FYI, the $15,000 price on Ebay is far more realistic than the $4,000 craigslist price.

&gt;How do I have fun with this person?  I've never run into such an obvious scam before.  I've got the craigslist guy replying to my emails regularly, albeit slowly.

&gt;Discussing the merits and drawbacks of  [BIP 100](http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf) ,  [BIP 101](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki) ,  [BIP 102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/173/files) , Pieter Wuille's  [BIP ???](https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6)  and other proposals is encouraged.
&gt;Themes regarding hard forks in general, such as what happens when they occur, how to ensure the fork is successful, and how the bitcoin network can react to hard forks which are potentially hostile, are open for discussion.
&gt;Avoid personal attacks and emotionally charged arguments.
&gt;No meta discussion.
&gt;Stay on topic.


&gt;There's been a lot of great discussion so far. Let's avoid falling back into voting cliques. They harm the discussion and will have no impact on the outcome of this debate. 


**Don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion.

  &gt;There is no current demand for bigger blocks - except you guys (note exactly what I said - I DID NOT say that we don't need bigger blocks, I said there is not currently a demand for them - it's artificially induced).

&gt;The rest of the world does not care of BTC or blockchain tech as it does not benefit them directly (as of writing this anyway).  Just because you suddenly make bitcoin block capacity 8X larger, doesn't mean that those 8X persons care or even plan to use it. (approx. 5.6 Million people based on BTC having 700K users)

&gt;I'm all for raising the block size limit, but artificially expressing a level of urgency to raise the block size limit and threatening the rest of all of bitcoin is NOT appropriate.  Just be sure that when you back Bitcoin XT, you're doing so for the right reasons, doing it as an act to ""prepare Bitcoin for scalability"" is a fallacy.

  &gt;(this was also a reply somewhere, context for the start:) Where the fuck is this psychotically insane bullshit that sidechains and the lightning network are centralized services? That is completely and utterly false. Lightning network relies on decentralized hubs of payment channels that STILL REQUIRE PRIVATE KEY SIGNATURES TO USE(EXACTLY LIKE THE BLOCKCHAIN). It is in no way centralized. Sidechains, anybody here ever heard of merged mining before? Or do everyone's brains just dump out valuable information every night to start fresh the next day? People are running to and fro screaming ""sidechains are just centralized ledgers!!!"" Not when you have ACTUAL MINERS MERGE MINING THEM. What the hell do you think will happen if a sidechain is actually promising with potential? Miners will secure it, just like the main chain. There's still transaction fees to earn for processing payments, and if someone found a logical reason to design an inflationary sidechain(I see none immediately evident), they could slowly just gain a bigger and bigger chunk of the bitcoin tied to the chains through the sidechain peg.

&gt;Everybody is running around like a chicken with their head cut off that can only remember a fraction of the things people should have learned by now, squaking doomsday this, doomsday that. It's fucking ridiculous. This is supposed to be a community of enthusiasts and experts, not 172,308 self-proclaimed know it all idiots.

&gt;The majority of the back and forth bullshit, is one person (whether they support XT or Core is irelavent) positing an actual hypothesis back by actual factual or argumentative data is attacked by someone attacking inconsistencies as if they can only conceptually grasp 1/10 of the total concept, and then when refuted, simply switch views to a different ""1/10th"" of the concept at hand, sidestepping each refuting and simply making another conceptually incoherent attack ignoring many layers of the topic at hand, until eventually a giant wall of text that no one wants to read sits there. That giant wall of text is someone attempting to state a position and engage in discourse, being met by the worst kind of troll, the one who comes across to the laymen as someone who is an expert when they are not, and it is totally destroying this community.

&gt;BITCOIN IS NOT YOUR PROPERTY, IT IS AN EVOLVING EXPERIMENT. IT IS NOT YOURS TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS WITH IT. It is something that hypothesis should be formed about, and tested, and those that fail those test discarded, and others tested until verifiable confirmations can be had. Then actions and design should build upon what is proven correct. Anything else is childish arrogant and selfish. If you promote XT, argue why with technical facts, not assumptions about HOW THE FUTURE WILL PLAY OUT(technology will keep pace). If you promote Core, ARGUE WITH FACTS BACKED BY DATA. DEMAND TESTS THAT ARE SOUND AND VERIFIABLE IF DATA DOES NOT EXIST. Do not lower yourself to spamming nodes offline, and refusing to even sit at the table anymore. If you support something else entirely, LOOK AT THE DATA, GATHER MORE OF IT. START THERE, not personal attacks and flawed assumptions.

&gt;That is all, bitcoin communities in general are starting to annoy me with both a lack of open discussion(which guess what, leads into this next thing:), a complete abundance of partial and total ignorance.

  &gt;So I'm starting out with a brand new machine and am installing Bitcoin Core 0.11.0  As expected its taking over a day.  One thing I'm noticing that is curious and perhaps causing me concern is that often times half of my peers are using XT 0.11.0 This shouldn't make a difference until I get to late August of this year or so.  

&gt;The above conditions were using a US IP address.  Out of curiosity I switched to an European IP address (using VPN) at block 33800 (January, 2014) and I have had no XT peers so far.

&gt;I know I want to know how much I can expect to pay someone to do the webdev for me. And I know from the school of hard knocks that there's always something else I would have liked to have known prior to getting too involved with a certain service or platform. Like the thing PayPal does with their arbitrary freezing accounts that some poor folks don't realize happens to too many people just like them. So I come here to ask, what else is there about doing business with Coinbase that I'll wish I'd had known months down the line?

&gt;Is it too hard for laypeople to setup an account w/ them? I don't think so, but that's my opinion. I don't think JavaScript is that hard with a good tutorial, either, but once it was way over my head years ago. Is that how Coinbase is for those who think Bitcoin's just for the Silk Road because that's what the news told them on TV once upon a time?

&gt;Please someone advise. Thanks alot.

  &gt;Backstory: I was setting up to make public an Ethereum mining pool with a custom implementation of stratum replacing the GetWork system. Eventually gave up on this due to concerns about botnets CPU mining, which seems to have been solidly founded given the behaviors of the pools which other people launched some time later. 

&gt;Is there enough people looking for a solo mining / shared pool dedicated to Bitcoin XT miners for this to be worth my while retooling? xtnodes.com only  [shows p2pool](http://xtnodes.com/bip101_mining_pools.php)  supporting it now that Slush has thrown in the towel, which seems a little empty. I'm a little concerned about fending off large denial of service attacks, but well prepared for that eventuality if it comes to it. I'm well up for the challenge if people are in need. 

&gt;For the moment it would be simply a solo pool with the block version marker set (and some secret sauce DDoS protection), extending to a full PPLNS pool if the demand exists. Let me know what you think of the idea.",2015-09-05 01:51:55+00:00,cur4jnw,1,t3_3jp0rb,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;For BIP100 it is unclear whether the activation threshold is 90% or 95%:


&gt;Changing the 1MB limit is accomplished in a manner similar to BIP 34, a one-way lock-in upgrade with a 12,000 block (3 month) threshold by 90% of the blocks.  [https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100/blob/master/discussion.md](https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100/blob/master/discussion.md) 
95% rule (""Point of no return""): If 11,400 of the last 12,000 blocks are version 4 or greater, reject all version &lt;= 3 blocks. (testnet4: 750 of last 1000)  [https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100/blob/master/bip-0100.mediawiki](https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100/blob/master/bip-0100.mediawiki) 


&gt;A simple plumbing change in Bitcoin's code was allowed to fester until it became a divisive community issue causing long and acrimonious debate and now entrenched opinion. This means that a small bloc of miners could prevent activation of BIP100 long after transaction volumes are hopelessly crippled. Having an activation threshold is a big improvement in BIP100 over the original ""flag day"" which opened up the insane risk of a 50/50 network split.

&gt;IMHO an activation threshold of 80% is warranted and should see BIP100 deployed smoothly (as many hold-outs upgrade before the next difficulty change), and allow Bitcoin to continue its growth success story into the future.

&gt;The 32MB is less of a concern as this may be best solved with Tier Nolan / Adam Back extension blocks (if it also proves a seriously divisive change).",2015-09-05 00:44:12+00:00,cur2k2q,1,t3_3joiw4,5553,BitcoinAll

  &gt;For BIP100 it is unclear whether the activation threshold is 90% or 95%:


&gt;Changing the 1MB limit is accomplished in a manner similar to BIP 34, a one-way lock-in upgrade with a 12,000 block (3 month) threshold by 90% of the blocks.
 [https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100/blob/master/discussion.md](https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100/blob/master/discussion.md) 

&gt;95% rule (""Point of no return""): If 11,400 of the last 12,000 blocks are version 4 or greater, reject all version &lt;= 3 blocks. (testnet4: 750 of last 1000)
 [https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100/blob/master/bip-0100.mediawiki](https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100/blob/master/bip-0100.mediawiki) 


&gt;A simple plumbing change in Bitcoin's code was allowed to fester until it became a divisive community issue causing long and acrimonious debate and now entrenched opinion. This means that a small bloc of miners could prevent activation of BIP100 long after transaction volumes are hopelessly crippled. Having an activation threshold is a big improvement in BIP100 over the original ""flag day"" which opened up the insane risk of a 50/50 network split.

&gt;IMHO an activation threshold of 80% is warranted and should see BIP100 deployed smoothly (as many hold-outs upgrade before the next difficulty change), and allow Bitcoin to continue its growth success story into the future.

&gt;The 32MB is less of a concern as this may be best solved with Tier Nolan / Adam Back extension blocks (if it also proves a seriously divisive change).",2015-09-04 23:11:44+00:00,cuqzr7b,1,t3_3joiw4,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I tried to explain my idea in pictures and  [a video](http://seawisphunter.com/mockup%20monday/2014/12/29/mockup-monday-33-bitcoin-open-assets-idea/) . Basically it's to use Bitcoin Open Assets as software licenses.  People are used to software licenses being a jumble of letters and numbers; so they could use Bitcoin without even knowing it. I suggest using the private key as the license. This does two positive things: 1) It allows for an after market for software licenses. 2) It disincentivizes piracy because sharing your private key puts own your license in jeopardy.

&gt;Now and then I've had concerns that this may not work or have some vulnerability.  I thought what if someone sent the asset to a Bitcoin eater address. Then no one could move it, and everyone could safely share that one license. However, because we're using the private key, no one has access to the private key of the eater address. Anyway, you guys are deeply immersed in this, what do you think might go wrong?",2015-09-04 21:18:22+00:00,cuqw0af,1,t3_3jo40c,18,BitcoinAll

&gt;Now I know that some pools are sympathetic with such mistakes and have returned between 2BTC - 200BTC (GHash, ASICMiner, Bitmain). Now what about BitFury? Does anybody have any experience with the company and contacting them? 

&gt;Maybe the manner in which to pool operates does not allow for such a refund, but I see  [https://blockchain.info/tx/55d1233fecb5f5e433f22690863ace3f96efefc71c4bbfba845e08fc8d109ee9](https://blockchain.info/tx/55d1233fecb5f5e433f22690863ace3f96efefc71c4bbfba845e08fc8d109ee9)  which contains my bitcoins, unspent :(

  &gt;I've been a small hodlr since before the bubble.  Shorted a bit on the way down and made a few extra coins, but for the first time I'm starting to think about deploying fresh capital into BTC.  My reasons are:

&lt;ol&gt;
&gt;Given the block size controversy, I would have expected the price to be in the mid 100s by now (or lower).  Given how well it's holding, I'm starting to wonder if we're near the bottom.
&gt;I think if the block size controversy resolves we're going to see a big rally.  It will be 'proof' that Bitcoin has survived yet another crisis and that decentralized adaptation of the protocol works.
&gt;Oddly, my involvement in the Ethereum community is making me more bullish on BTC.  To me, it's the first legitimate 'Altcoin' and I can see all kinds of ways it makes BTC more valuable, and BTC makes it more valuable.  It's a small confirmation of my thesis that the future of cryptocurrency will resemble (to an extent) the traditional stock market, with hundreds of 'issues' trading side by side, and heavily interlinked blockchains.
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;Overall, I'm hugely bullish on the space, and I see BTC as the liquidity 'entry point' into cryptocurrency.

&gt;Would love to hear others thoughts on the matter!",2015-09-04 16:40:24+00:00,cuql47p,1,t3_3jmzv5,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Unless your only internet access consists of a mobile phone with a data cap or dial up, please run an XT node! It's really easy. We ought to be up around 50%, instead we're languishing around 10%. The DDOS attackers can't be allowed to win, if you are having problems contact your ISP and complain.

&gt;If you're worried about bandwidth usage, my node with currently 47 connections isn't slowing down my internet (16MBit down/2MBit up) in any noticeable way, this includes uplink usage such as VOIP, gaming (PS4), cloud data/photo storage, and remote access to my network.

&gt;If you don't want to run it on your own computer, you can either buy/rent a node running on a remote server ""cloud"", or get dedicated hardware, for example:

&gt;**cheapest option**:

&gt;**Nicer/faster option**:
 [https://bitseed.org/product/xt/](https://bitseed.org/product/xt/) 

&gt;I'm sure there are many other options, including that old Core 2 duo with 4 GB ram in your closet that you don't use anymore, this is just a skeletal list of options.

  &gt;Bitcoin works essentially the same as stocks do: the price is driven by supply and demand. What if companies create individual cryptocurrencies to issue ""shares"" of their company?

&gt;For example, say a company called XYZ Inc. creates a ""currency"" (pretty much a stock) called XYZCoin. They could set the protocol to only allow a certain number of coins to come into existence. XYZ Inc. would hold maybe 40% to 50% of all possible coins that could become available. The rest would be sent into the market for investors to buy and sell. XYZ Inc. would raise money based on the price rise (or take a loss based on the price fall) of this XYZCoin, because they own a substantial amount of the available quantity.

&gt;Is this a feasible idea? Has anyone come up theorized this before?",2015-09-04 12:53:44+00:00,cuqcy2a,1,t3_3jm3qh,11,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Many here have serious concerns about BIP 100, let's assume that we can leave them aside for the sake of this post, that they will be worked through and BIP 100 ends up a workable solution to the block-size problem.

&gt;There are some pretty hard-line developers in Bitcoin Core, and the ""rule by unanimous agreement"" which has come about recently gives them a veto if they shout loud enough. They seem to be keeping fairly mum about BIP 100 now, because the momentum behind it makes it look like BIP 101 won't go through. But make no mistake, some of them don't want the blocksize to grow at all, and when it comes to commit time, after developers have put in the work to get it implemented, tantrums will the thrown again. When it comes down to it, the problem isn't block size, it's ""rule by unanimous agreement"".

&gt;Alternative clients are thus an inevitability. The mining pools currently see BIP 100 as an option, one which serves their interests. When a developer throws a wrench into the works, it will cease to be an option. They'll be left with: do nothing and accept 1MB blocks indefinitely, or BIP 101. Miners overwhelmingly want to solve the blocksize issue, it's fairly clear what they would choose in that circumstance.",2015-09-04 11:26:45+00:00,cuqb39a,1,t3_3jlu35,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;We are being told that BIP101 isn't a compromise. But anything that isn't the complete removal of the block size limit IS a compromise. Because that not having the limit was the original vision. That is what we really want, that is what we really need. 

&gt;Hear me out. Would anyone ever agree to add a limit if there wasn't a limit in the first place?

&gt;By focussing on removing the limit completely we gain more ground and we debunk more counter arguments. If they are on the extreme with their 1mb limit, then we should not already compromise and meet them more than halfway. 

&gt;I mean really what else do we need besides good (default) soft limits and orphan limits? 

&gt;Turning a temporary fix into a feature is definitely not sound engineering. Thats what the core developers want, and honestly thats what BIP101 proposes.

  &gt;This thread is open for discussion on block size and hard forks.

&gt;New submissions regarding block size and hard forks are not permitted at this time, so unless you have very substantial news to share, post your questions and comments here. Please read the following guidelines before proceeding:


&gt;There's a new subreddit guideline in the sidebar. It reads:


&gt;Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.

&gt;Discussing the merits and drawbacks of  [BIP 100](http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf) ,  [BIP 101](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki) ,  [BIP 102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/173/files) , Pieter Wuille's  [BIP ???](https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6)  and other proposals is encouraged.
&gt;Themes regarding hard forks in general, such as what happens when they occur, how to ensure the fork is successful, and how the bitcoin network can react to hard forks which are potentially hostile, are open for discussion.
&gt;Avoid personal attacks and emotionally charged arguments.
&gt;No meta discussion.
&gt;Stay on topic.


&gt;There's been a lot of great discussion so far. Let's avoid falling back into voting cliques. They harm the discussion and will have no impact on the outcome of this debate. 


**Don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion.

&gt;After eliminating extreme values, the mean is the best there is! The median or percentile is taken when the extreme values are stil present.

  &gt;There is a lot of FUD about the blocksize, censorship, then there are stresstest where you cannot send any bitcoins without transaction-fees like western unions... People want to use Bitcoin and not want to be afraid of sending coins. So what is happening? It seems that everybody is trying to threaten Bitcoin, the devs are fighting and so on...
This is bad for Bitcoin! I do not have enough knowledge to talk about the BIPÂ´s or the Blocksize and what is good and what is bad - but thatÂ´s the point: Average JoeÂ´s donÂ´t know whatÂ´s going on! This drama is going on for weeks now and exactly this drama is scaring: many wonÂ´t buy in or start with bitcoin in a situation like this.

  &gt;I just read  [this article in the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/refugee-crisis-what-can-you-do-to-help)  and had some thoughts about how charities and non-governmental organisations could use bitcoin to help the refugees.

&lt;ol&gt;
Request donations from the public into a multisig bitcoin escrow.
Register the refugees using the  [bitcoin Identity protocol](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Identity_protocol_v1) .  Tracking the refugees/migrants/asylum seekers is a huge task that a distributed database would be well-suited. 
Issue adult refugees a bitcoin debit card (like a Xapo account).  Use the registry to ensure there is no 'double-dipping'.
Distribute the bitcoins into the refugees bitcoin account. 
The refugees can then access euros through ATMs for basic needs.
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;It doesn't meet all the needs, but it maximizes the amount of these donations going directly to those in need.  It also provides a platform of accountability that  [emergency operations desperately need](https://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCQQFjABahUKEwiN9uuB7tzHAhVDXhQKHRIMAJ4&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2014%2F10%2F29%2F359365276%2Fon-superstorm-sandy-anniversary-red-cross-under-scrutiny&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxYRONHH2UCl_Sg3LvHcpweJMcPg&amp;sig2=tUUMlTfxP7G592yx1vTraQ) .

  &gt;So, I'm very new to bitcoin. I bought about 0.2, since it was my first time, from CoinBase and went to transfer it to an account on another site via wallet address. On CoinBase's end, the transaction was confirmed about 3 days ago, but looking at my account on the other site now, I have nada. If this could be due to miners not looking at it for a while because I paid nothing for the transfer, I can rest a little easier knowing that. I also know the site I transferred to isn't a phishing site. Also, I really have no idea what this means, but the wallet address for the second site shows, from blockchain.info, that it received the bitcoin but has 0 as the total balance and shows two transactions, one with the address sending BTC to another address, which is troubling, but my account history on the site shows nothing. Is it normal for a transfer with no fee to take this long? If not, assuming no phishing involved, will the transfer eventually be confirmed or just sent back to me? What about that  account receiving the BTC but having nothing in it and showing a transaction of sending to another account on blockchain.info? Plz help.

  &gt;Should I respond to Coinbase's compliance review or nah? Apparently I am a high volume user, their compliance officer just noticed.

&gt;I've made 2 buying transactions this year. A total of 5 transactions. (bought, immediately sent to a different address. bought, immediately sent to a different address. Coinbase account received a tiny amount of btc)

&gt;For the record, these are all transactions between addresses where I control the private keys.

&gt;Anyway, been a Coinbase user for over 2 years. Definitely did have some higher volume times, when Coinbase was relevant lol and was the US savior to the Mt. Gox problem.

&gt;But now? Do I care?

&gt;Is the answer ""just tell them your funding sources it isn't that big of a deal"" or should I take my high volume self somewhere else.",2015-09-04 03:55:52+00:00,cuq36og,1,t3_3jks81,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;So I have a donate button on my blog that is tied to my real life identity. The way I understand it is that any coins sent from this wallet at a later date will be easy to tie to me. This is fine but I'm not a huge fan of people being able to look at my bitcoin purchase history ( nothing illegal or embarrassing but still). If I sent these coins to a multi bit wallet would that increase the annonimity? If done while masking my ip would that be better?

&gt;Just need a little help understanding and finding a way to re-annonomize my coins.",2015-09-04 03:34:05+00:00,cuq2iyn,1,t3_3jkpuv,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hello. Yesterday I mad two deposits to my wallet. One for $180 and another for $97. I then sent $271 to a friends address. 5 minutes Later I recieved a duplicate payment of $97 creating a double spend. This left my transaction of $271 unconformed. Some please help me. Blockchain.info was no help whatsoever. Is there anyway I can undo the transaction w bitundo? It's been over 30 hours and 0 conformations. Here is the hash

  &gt;It's good to see that now the ""do nothing"" camp is no longer taken seriously in the block size debate. However, the BIP100 proposal has me concerned for one main reason - BIP100 complicates the protocol unnecessarily. We should not be complicating the protocol unnecessary, especially at the whims of unpredictable human operators. As any engineer knows, the more ""moving parts"" the design has, the more opportunity it has for errors.

&gt;In particular, I'm not all that concerned about potential errors in J.Garzik's coding or implementation of the design - I'm quite confident that with his expertise and the thorough vetting of the BIP, that we won't let nasty bugs slip through. I'm concerned about the potential perturbations to the game theory that underlie the decision making in Bitcoin mining.

&gt;The implementation of BIP100 introduces all new dynamics of game theory that I don't think have been properly studied. Why are we considering adding the ability for miners to decide on block size, thus adding a whole new variable to the game theory of mining that has not been carefully examined? Has this proposal been properly studied or simulated in any substantial way with regard to these dynamics? If not, isn't it an irresponsible proposal?

&gt;For example, China has substantially lower average bandwidth than the United States. China also controls a significant portion of the hashing power. Why do we think that miners will not collude on a regional or national level to influence the block size? Isn't it short-sighted and naive to think that we will not see nationalistic lines form and the block vote turn into a regional ""miner-war""? We need not just be concerned with 21% attacks from one specific pool. We may start to see colluding and decision making on larger geographical scales then we are traditionally used to considering. Combine that with the fact that we cannot anticipate the external forces that influence the miners' votes, and we have a completely unknown future block size situation.

&gt;In the end I simply ask why? Why would anyone introduce this unnecessary complexity to Bitcoin? Why would they let the unpredictable whims of humans, possibly with ulterior motives, dictate such an important aspect of the protocol - one that if done incorrectly could hamstring the network and prevent growth?

&gt;BIP101 provides stable and predictable growth. Let's not add a bunch of moving parts when we could accomplish a more elegant solution with more predictability through something like BIP101.",2015-09-04 02:47:43+00:00,cuq12ae,1,t3_3jkkhf,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Okay everyone, I have read several articles, watched a YouTube video, so obviously I am now an expert.  But I'm having some trouble.  So, I have an Antminer U2.. It has a black heat sink, if that makes a difference (I've seen a lot of different colors on Google Image).  I joined the Slush pool (I think, it is mining.bitcoin.cz).  I setup a script as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bfgminer -S antminer:all -o stratum+tcp://stratum.bitcoin.cz:3333 -u myusername.worker1 -p XXX
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&gt;According to what the pool website told me, I was to put worker1 as my worker after my username, and then the password did not matter.  When I run my script, it finders the Antminer, but then nothing seems to happen.  It gets a ""SICK"" error shortly after I start the script.  What have I done wrong?",2015-09-04 02:04:05+00:00,cupzlfc,1,t3_3jkf5w,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;The variable we use to deal with potential future resource bottle necks has been block size. But couldn't using the block time (10 minutes) as the variable for change be used? With the benefit of also reducing confirmation time. I can imagine I am missing something obvious that I hope someone can explain to me.

&gt;Such a scenario would also require the block reward size be a floating variable, still halved every 4 year through a function based on the average reward per N_time_sized block",2015-09-04 01:48:58+00:00,cupz2ie,1,t3_3jkd3n,18,BitcoinAll

  &gt;So I wanted to get my bitcoin wallet back up and running, it had been years! And I mean like 6! So I download bitcore and start synching it up. Mind you I just wanted a fresh install for a wallet. It is taking literally days to synch, I go to play some Starcraft with friends and stop it from synching so it wont use up all my bandwidth. Next I go to start it back up before I go to bed, next thing I know its just stuck at the loading screen. I decide to click abort and bitcore shuts down. Next thing I know my HDD (secondary, this is where I decided to install bitcore) is making this weird brzzzz-beep, sound over and over. I go to shut down my PC but it is stuck on the shutting down screen. I decide to just whack it by cutting power. Next thing I know, whenever my computer boots up that sound comes back and then says SATA 6 Disk error, and cannot read/recognize the HDD. Any help would be appreciated, I'm next to positive Bitcore is what caused this. I dont even care too much about whats on the HDD but I can't even detect it to reformat it, please help.",2015-09-04 01:23:00+00:00,cupy5mq,1,t3_3jk9z4,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;At this point mining pools have already established themselves and currently are the most economically efficient entities competing in the mining space. Anyone can join one of these pools and contribute their computing power. Yes, the mining pools have a lot of say, but ultimately it's about the number of nodes. So, can the Bitcoin community agree on what constitutes a healthy number of nodes? Is it no less than 5,000? 1,000? Is there diminishing returns to having more and more nodes? Is there an optimal ratio between the number of nodes and the number of transactions?",2015-09-04 00:51:32+00:00,cupx2fs,1,t3_3jk5sj,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;People often reference the ethereal but holy tenant of Bitcoin: Decentralization. But, nobody really has a clear definition of what that actually means. The way I see it, there are many factors that contribute to centralization, or as I like to call it - a decision bottleneck. We can look at miners, exchanges, full node count, developers with commit access - all of these things and more are factors that lead to disproportionate say in the hands of 'too few', whatever that magic number actually is.

&gt;But I want to specifically focus on full nodes here, because I often see the complaint that full node count has dropped dramatically touted as a sign that the Bitcoin sky is falling. Is it really though?

&gt;I've seen opinions from the 'experts' running the gambit from ""literally everyone should be able to run a full node"" to ""the network would probably work just fine with a dozen full nodes"". Obviously, these are mutually exclusive positions to hold. The vision of Bitcoin cannot follow both at once. We are going to have to choose what 'acceptable' decentralization actually is, if only to know when we should be concerned. Without a concrete metric to measure our proposals against, how will we ever make the engineering tradeoffs that need to occur? Will it simply be the loudest point prevails? That doesn't sound like a very good way to solve technical problems to me.

&gt;My thought: full nodes need not be run by every end user. In fact, regular end users are extremely unlikely to be targets of SPV attacks - they simply don't move enough money around to make attacks worthwhile. Someone moving many BTC certainly would do well to run a full node, because they're dealing with more money. But the average guy who has a few BTC and uses it to buy coffee with foldapp? The risk just isn't a huge deal.

&gt;So right now the cost is fairly low to run a full node. Any user with a decent internet connection and a modern computer can run one, as I do. Will that always be the case? No. But, I think we'll be okay as long as the Bitcoin economy grows.

&gt;As people are moving more and more value, and as businesses handle more and more value, those businesses will have incentives to run full nodes for the security it provides. Even if regular consumers have little to no reason to run a full node, in a healthy ecosystem that spans the globe and contains millions of bitcoin-accepting businesses, we'll be more than decentralized enough should even a small fraction of them opt to run a full node.

&gt;So I think a good metric to gauge health of the full node space is whether a bitcoin business can easily run a full node in house.

&gt;What are your thoughts? Am I off the mark? Are we doomed if you can't run a node on a toaster? Are we doomed if we can?",2015-09-04 00:20:26+00:00,cupw05a,1,t3_3jk1y1,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;In an effort to create at least one viable exchange for trading I am going to do my best to consistently offer the best bid and best ask at BitMex for the monthly and quarterly options.  I am challenging others who are interested in seeing that exchange become viable to check in regularly and improve either the bid or ask on as many of the offerings as possible, even if it is with trivial volume.  The spreads are so large that there really should almost always be some side that you would like if taken at the bid or ask.  The sizes they allow you to trade with are so small that you can have offerings which take less than $1 margin to post (honestly I have no idea why they use such small units, but for bringing down the spread it takes most of the risk out of this exercise).

&gt;My hope is that we can bring these spreads down collectively.  If some of you like the sides opposite me and post with volume, maybe we can do some trading.

&gt;Right now, I've been on both sides for the XBT September, December, and March expirations for several hours, untraded and unimproved.  If collectively we would step up the bids and step down the asks this platform might become relevant.  I have seen many cheerleaders for the site, I am asking for those people to step up and place some orders.  I will commit to regularly improve both sides (although I'm not going to post equal volume on the side I don't want, I'll still try to improve the spread).  I don't use bots to post, so I can't really make the market there, but I will make an effort.

&gt;Please let me know if you have interest.  My interest is selfish, I like trading bitcoin and want a place to do that.  My fear is that I will be forced to go back to the traditional marketplace, which for me has been much tougher to consistently predict.  I would rather do this full time, but I don't have a place to play or anyone to play with right now.

&gt;BitMex also should see this as a challenge.  They need to find market makers to bring the spreads down below 1% almost always and honestly below $1 most of the time.  Less than that and they really don't provide a viable option for trading.  I believe they have responsibility to provide more than an excellent platform if they want to be taken seriously and if they intend to actually be viable as a financial enterprise.  There is no way they can make money with the business currently being transacted on their platform.",2015-09-03 23:06:25+00:00,cuptglj,1,t3_3jjshg,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I think you all realize where I'm going with this, but to be super clear: I am researching the potential for a low friction, 100% transparent way for the Bitcoin community to help with the current refugee crisis, covering basic needs now, and witnessing in real time how the money is allocated and impacting the communities. I don't want to get my hopes up, and I'm sure someone might already have though about/tried this, but this could be a triple whammy: Direct and swift help for the refugees, support for strained local mediterranean economies, showcasing (yet again) the power of Bitcoin to do good, immediately.

&gt;I want to be pretty frank about the fact that I have no concrete sense of how to actually do this outside of some loose ideas, hence why I am asking for help from the Bicoin superorganism. I literally just thought of this in the shower, so be gentle with me.

&gt;If anyone has any ideas on how this can be pulled off regardless of whether or not such suppliers exist (I, for one, cannot seem to find any), please share your thoughts.

&gt;I have seen this community do amazing things for humanity in the past, and I would truly appreciate if we can get a good brainstorming session going. Perhaps something good will come of it, perhaps not. This is probably literally the least we can do.

  &gt;Hey reddit, so I just got an antminer s3 and peripherals for $100 even (which im pretty sure was a good deal). Anyway, I am wondering which pool would be best for this relatively low hashrate (of about 430 Gh/s usually).  I plan to be consistently connected to the pool so ""score"" based rewards would work fine I suppose (that's what I read was the problem with those type of pools). I also don't really plan on upgrading my hashrate anytime soon (as I am a broke college student). So! Almighty knowledge bank that is reddit, any insight on my problem would be greatly appreciated, and feel free to ask me questions about any specifics.

  &gt;Trying to become more educated about this but need some help, please.

&gt;I understand concern is primarily related to slower block propagation between miners.

&gt;How much slower (milliseconds?) are we talking from 1mb to 2mb, 8mb, 20mb?, 50mb?

&gt;How much of an advantage is this really? Has somebody done the math? Does a miner gain 0.1% ?  1%? 0.01%, 5%

&gt;Also, taking into account the ever-increasing speeds of the internet, what is the likelihood the internet will/won't keep up with the increasing block sizes?

&gt;For example, I want to know if the internet speeds increase at X trend over time, and the block size max increases at Y trend over time, the advantage of a Z hashrate miner only goes up A in 10 years, vs B (more miner advantage) if those same numbers were calculated using today's (slower) internet speeds.

&gt;A semi-concrete example: Given we have 20mb blocks today, how much is the advantage, to a 40% of total hashrate miner today? 2%?  But, lets assume 20mb blocks won't happen for 5 years, given global internet speed improvements in 5 years, will that bring the 40% total hashrate miner's advantage down to only 1% maybe down to 0.5%? Or, are the numbers more scary, like 5-10% advantage?

&gt;How about if we tried this numbers for 8mb blocks today? I'd like to know how bad the risk of centralization really is if I were to support BIP101.

&gt;Additionaly, if BIP101 were to stay in place for 5 years, and given the internet speed increases alongside the BIP101 size increases in the same 5 years, will it be worse in terms of centralization in 5 years, or the same as 8MB today?

&gt;Thanks in advance for the enlightenment.",2015-09-03 21:11:32+00:00,cuppdep,1,t3_3jjcet,16,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Just for background, I am a recent Finance graduate with extensive banking experience. With work experience in both NZ and Australia at major financial institutions.

&gt;What can I do to help create a liquid BTC marketplace? I want to start up a AUS - NZ remittance service, as many people send money back and forward between the two (myself included, being an NZ citizen working in AU). 

&gt;I think to be able to offer this service I need to be able to buy and sell BTC easily in both countries. Currently NZ has some bare bones ""exchanges"", and AUS doesn't have much better. 

&gt;Would I even need an exchange in both countries? Are there any liquid international exchanges that accept free bank transfers from both AUS and NZ?

  &gt;Hi everyone, I have just started to use bitcoin core wallet, here was me thinking nice and easy wallet to use just like paypal, I admit I was wrong.

&gt;I bought bitcoins off bittylicious and sent them to my bitcoin core wallet, great I thought so I opened up bitcoin core and got hit with 6 years worth of transactions to download, left it for 3 days and it got to 7 weeks remaining and it gave me an error about cant rebuild database.

&gt;I reloaded it again all 6 years worth over 3 days come home from work to a power cut and yes you guessed it rebuild the database.

&gt;So I got another wallet Electrum it's called so I imported my key and I can't spend it as it's watch only or something.

&gt;Please can someone tell me what I can do or what I have done wrong as I am new to this.

&gt;What is the purpose of the newly added 1 MB floor? It seems clear from the current information available that 1 MB is presently too high for the limit, and it is entirely one-sided to only allow increases when decreases are much more likely to be needed in the short term.

&gt;I have both a financial and philosophical stake in this grand experiment and want it to succeed badly.

&gt;This would largely solve the 21% attack problem. 21% of hashing power could still keep the blocksize from growing, but it couldn't shrink it.

  &gt;My understanding is that all of the scaling options are slow. The fastest one gets us to the equivalent of Visa processing in something like 2030. That's Visa alone. Not Visa and MasterCard together.

&gt;I realize the theory goes:  ""We will not have the need for faster transactions for awhile"". But this is incredibly shortsighted thinking. 

&gt;We're really going to spend the next 15 years saying that Bitcoin can't even match Visa? 

&gt;If you understand how people in the finance world work, you'd understand that Bitcoin needs to be able to do Visa now, so that confidence can be had in the system for future projects. If we spend the next 15 years saying it'll handle only 1/20th of what Visa alone can do, they're going to dismiss the technology outright as a payment system. 

&gt;Maybe this is why the lightning network guys shouldn't even worry. Because you guys are still going to be the ones to provide the Visa/MasterCard processing capabilities in the short term. It's going to be because of the lightning network that anyone in the industry has any confidence in the system in the first place. 

&gt;I feel like people are missing the larger picture when it comes to this scalability issue. It's great that the protocol is going to scale over time, but it's going to scale so slowly that it's reputation in the eyes of outsiders will continue to suffer for the next 15 years.",2015-09-03 16:16:03+00:00,cupdp47,1,t3_3ji5bo,8,BitcoinAll

&gt;Because I believe Bitcoin isn't broken, I do not buy the false dichotomy that a choice ""must be made"" between different competing BIPs, or else the sky is going to fall on our heads without notice and ""potential new users"" are going to ""leave ship"".

&gt;Because I understand that the security of the network has to somehow be paid for, and the current money issuance schedule is still in a phase where mining is heavily subsidized. I know that at the same fee levels, even with 100mb blocks, the miners would make nowhere near the current block reward.

&gt;Because I conlude that therefore, blocks must necessarily be full for the Bitcoin network to be able to pay for its own security.

&gt;Because I realize that the block space is a scarce resource that is sold, but not paid for, by the miners, especially with constant time block propagation proposed by IBLT and the like, which is why a ""tragedy of the commons"" situation can only be avoided by a block size cap.

&gt;Because I compare this situation with how nonsensical it would be to declare that ""people should be allowed to chop down as much wood as they'd like from the rainforest, because the market will magically sort it out and protect the trees"".

&gt;Because I am not scared by the constant fear-mongering of those who compulsively want to ""fix"" a system that isn't broken to ensure that they'll get rich while they sleep by allowing more people to ""buy into Bitcoin"".

&gt;Because I don't buy the false sense of urgency that is manipulated upon us, I want to see if less costly solutions can be found, and I want to revisit once fees become more important than the block reward.

&gt;This is why, my friends, I support BIP000.",2015-09-03 15:18:16+00:00,cupbfwc,1,t3_3jhwtd,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I'm not affiliated with Bitnodes in any way, but I just received my order of a B1 full node and wanted to share the excitement and praises for the seller. The unit came well packaged and looks pretty neat (see link). The seller also reached out to me proactively to make sure I was happy with the delivery and answer any questions I may have, which is great customer service. Now to ""upgrading"" the node to XT!

  &gt;I think a neat idea would be to create a dark pool or private trading company that brokers shares only with Bitcoin. Independent companies could choose to become listed, the incentive being that they do not need to rely on the (centralized) dollar.

&gt;Does anyone know if anyone has created something like this? Additionally, while this idea is not completely decentralized, has anyone created a completely decentralized stock exchange based on the blockchain?

  &gt;This thread is open for discussion on block size and hard forks.

&gt;New submissions regarding block size and hard forks are not permitted at this time, so unless you have very substantial news to share, post your questions and comments here. Please read the following guidelines before proceeding:


&gt;There's a new subreddit guideline in the sidebar. It reads:


&gt;Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.

&gt;Discussing the merits and drawbacks of  [BIP 100](http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf) ,  [BIP 101](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki) ,  [BIP 102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/173/files) , Pieter Wuille's  [BIP ???](https://gist.github.com/sipa/c65665fc360ca7a176a6)  and other proposals is encouraged.
&gt;Themes regarding hard forks in general, such as what happens when they occur, how to ensure the fork is successful, and how the bitcoin network can react to hard forks which are potentially hostile, are open for discussion.
&gt;Avoid personal attacks and emotionally charged arguments.
&gt;No meta discussion.
&gt;Stay on topic.


&gt;There's been a lot of great discussion so far. Let's avoid falling back into voting cliques. They harm the discussion and will have no impact on the outcome of this debate.

  &gt;Hey Redditors..! I work in a tech support job and I've never used bitcoin before... one of my customers has an old XP (Gasp!) machine and has had a crypto virus on it - with no backups..! They've asked me to help recover their data.
The machine runs some sort of high tech drawing / CAD software and machine and they are willing to pay the ransom to decrypt the files.. they have little other choice.

&gt;Anyway..! I found an aussie company selling Bitcoins and have setup an account and purchased some bitcoins 2.25 (almost $800 AUD) however now I try and pay the ransom it says I don't have enough due to some fee... it wants 2.2501 bitcoins total..!

&gt;It was a huge pain to arrange payment (IN THE BANK!) couldn't do it online so was wondering if anyone is able / willing to send me  literally 0.0001 bitcoins so I have enough for the transaction..!?

&gt;Willing to netbank the $ it's worth direct to someone or paypal it or something...? Just trying to avoid going back to the customer and saying... ""actually you need to go to the bank again and transfer another $2 worth into the account..""

&gt;anyway my bitcoin payment account number thing is:

  &gt;Not everyone is aware of this, but the bitcoin network can only support, at most, about six million people holding value on the network. I'm not talking about cups of coffee here, I'm just talking about the ability to 'own' any bitcoin at all stored safely on the blockchain (not held by a 3rd party centralized system such as exchanges, coinbase, etc.).

&gt;In fact, if you wanted bitcoin to act as a payment network, one which can accommodate cups of coffee and other regular commerce, then the bitcoin network can support less than 100,000 people.

&gt;Yes, we are really that small. That is why the years we spent trying to get merchants to accept bitcoin now seem completely pointless.

&gt;I fully believe, personally, that bitcoin must evolve to being almost exclusively a settlement network and that the vast majority of all transactions should happen off-chain.

&gt;However, I also believe that many more people should be able to hold value on the blockchain and, if we want to accommodate even just a hundred million people, the blocksize needs to increase by tens of megabytes.

&gt;Who wants a bitcoin network that the average person can never access? Not me.",2015-09-03 03:35:09+00:00,cuoxgw3,1,t3_3jg3dv,8,BitcoinAll

  &gt;While not much discussion has been going on, there is still quite a widespread amount of DDoS'ing going on against XT nodes. 

&gt;This is an attack against my 100mbit connection last night:

&gt; [http://puu.sh/jX3ue/ccd585d7e4.png](http://puu.sh/jX3ue/ccd585d7e4.png) 

&gt;I had to change my MAC and get a new IP..  I setup a new rule within PFSENSE to block all dns reflection attacks that aren't origin from my providers DNS, we'll see if this fixes it.

&gt;Regardless, this is likely still an issue among all nodes, I noticed that they came in spikes/waves but then suddenly its like I got on the top of the list to take out, and it was massive, keep in mind my internet only is 100mbit, so the attack could of likely been MUCH higher but thats all I was seeing on my side.",2015-09-03 03:30:54+00:00,cuoxc71,1,t3_3jg2y5,13,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Hi fam.

&gt;So, I am a new bitcoin user, and I've made a few mistakes along the way. I purchased bitcoin and attempted to send it from an online wallet to a wallet on my computer. All seemed fine, except that the bitcoin never showed up in the wallet on my computer. I am sure that I sent it to the correct address with the correct amount. Unfortunately, I believe the problem is that the wallet on my computer has not synchronized with the network. I know that this can take an extremely long time, but I have had the wallet downloaded on my computer for 10 days so it should be done by now. The synchronizing networks bar has not moved since the first day. I believe it's frozen. Anyway I can make this work again so I haven't lost all my btc?

&gt;Any suggestions? Desperate for help here. ",2015-09-03 02:16:39+00:00,cuouyqc,1,t3_3jfu7d,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;We've supposedly got more than 500x the processing power of all the supercomputers in the world combined, in a mad world-wide lottery/race of thousands of nodes competing to ""mine"" the next block on the chain.

&gt;Currently the system is using:


&gt;a simple ""nonce"" to ""random things up"" in terms of the results of doing hashing, and 
&gt;a ""difficulty"", which is periodically reset in proportion to total global hashing power - to ""random things up"" among the miners.


&gt;And meanwhile nodes are already continuously uploading and downloading many megabytes or gigabytes of ""candidate transactions looking for inclusion in the next block"" - and this network throughput capacity needs to grow somehow.

&gt;If we're gonna do a fork - why don't we try to come up with some kind of approach which really addresses the network throughput capacity bottleneck using some kind of network-level algorithm? There could be some interesting algorithms or even implementations that might be able to provide ideas or even some code. 

&gt;For example, LevelDB is used to store local copies of the blockchain. Maybe some network-level aspects could be handled by something like CalvinDB from Yale (which goes beyond Paxos and RAFT) - eg creating a ""blockpool"" and selecting a ""consortium"" from it:

&gt; [www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dna/papers/scalable-calvin.pdf](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dna/papers/scalable-calvin.pdf) 

&gt;What if miners could submit their ""candidate blocks"" to a kind of short-lived globally distributed pool of candidate blocks a/k/a a ""blockpool"" - and then some globally distributed algorithm could search through this ""blockpool"" trying to coalesce together a large (or the largest) ""consortium"" of ""non-overlapping candidate blocks"" - ie a large set of blocks which do not share any ""input addresses"" in common. 

&gt;Then instead of appending just one block to the chain, the Bitcoin algorithm would append this (potentially rather large) ""consortium"" of non-overlapping blocks to the chain all at once.

&gt;So maybe our criterion about ""how many transactions can go in the next block"" could be quite a bit more subtle and complex than just a maximum number of bytes - and our randomness and difficulty configurations for ""which candidate block gets chosen"" could involve something other than a (locally chosen) nonce. 

&gt;A network-selected ""consortium"" of candidate blocks having no overlapping source addresses could be an interesting alternative (and much bigger) ""block"" to append to the chain.",2015-09-03 01:32:47+00:00,cuotjvz,1,t3_3jfoyr,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;I used to use amagimetals.com, but they stopped accepting bitcoin since at least July. They will accept bitcoin again ""any day now"" according to their support staff, via email on July 23. Kind of funny since they were the ones that said they would stop accepting fiat after 2016..

&gt;providentmetals.com seems like a good shop, I've used them a few times and didn't have any problems. But they charge 1% more for using Bitcoin than they do if you paid cash. That just leaves a sour taste in my mouth, so I went looking for more options.

&gt;veldtgold.com looks really good, and comes out a tiny bit cheaper than providentmetals, and doesn't charge a higher price for bitcoin.

&gt;I'm wondering if anyone found a good gold/silver dealer that takes bitcoin, and doesn't charge extra for using it. I'm located in the US.",2015-09-03 01:21:10+00:00,cuot6s0,1,t3_3jfnjp,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Alright, so I was moving around some coins and ended up moving them to an encrypted wallet that I thought I had the password to. (First mistake) After realizing that every variation of the assumed password was wrong I moved onto attempting to recover it via seed. I also assumed I had that particular seed; I did not. So now I'm at a total loss, and the amount on the wallet warrants me to at least try crowd sourcing a solution. There is 0.59 Bitcoin held on the wallet, any help is appreciated. I'm willing to give .10 to whoever can help me recover it successfully. Thank you!",2015-09-03 01:03:49+00:00,cuosn8k,1,t3_3jfl2q,4,BitcoinAll

  &gt;Thats a proposal but I think we should all be very carefull to always call bitcoin core and bitcoinXT bitcoin core client and bitcoinXT client or reference implementation as Gavin say.

&gt;I think lots of the debate is poluted with semantic trickery and bitcoin core dev team take advantage of it as the name bitcoin core is ambiguous and it tend to imply that bitcoin core= bitcoin.

&gt;I know it's a pain, it takes longer to write but that ambiguity its bad for the debate lets call a client a client! And that what bitcoin core is!",2015-09-02 20:42:33+00:00,cuojsfi,1,t3_3jekf8,5,BitcoinAll

  &gt;From Wikipedia entry on California Gold Rush:

&gt;""At first, loose gold and gold nuggets could be picked up off the ground. Later, gold was recovered from streams and riverbeds using simple techniques, such as panning. More sophisticated methods were developed and later adopted elsewhere. At its peak, technological advances reached a point where significant financing was required, and mining companies became important. Gold worth tens of billions of today's dollars was recovered, which led to great wealth for a few. However, many returned home with only a little more than what they had originally started with.""",2015-09-02 19:54:23+00:00,cuohvy4,1,t3_3jedjc,5,BitcoinAll

When 1mb is a part of the protocol, it just is.  There is no discussing the matter.

I am leery (as are others) at how ""voting"" for a blocksize limit is a zero sum game where there is a more profitable/less profitable answer to the question as to what the blocksize limit is at any given point in time to a specific mining actor.

This has the potential to cause imbalance in the ecosystem as extremely large percentages of mining hashes vote a specific direction and push the limit to gain maximum profitability (this can be tiny blocksizes or large and everything in between).

Now, remove BIP100 and just put in a 4 mb cap which doubles every 2 years with a ceiling of 32mb and suddenly there is no discussion about incentives or a risk of service outages due to game theory and mining.

I think the bad taste of BIP100 is the game theory aspect. (and it is no surprise mining operations vote for this BIP since it allows them to potentially make more profit. If we decide on the change based on mining votes, this BIP was a genius move; since of course mining operators would want more power/profit)

This isn't actually correct.

On August 15th a new version of Core (renamed to what you stated) was released **that has the potential to cause a fork**.

There is no fork until 75% of the miners vote ""yes"" AND an actual block is mined that is greater than 1mb.

There is a lot not to like about BIP100.

As Mike Hearn said, and I'm sure a lot of you reading this post realize, the ""default"" setting is what human beings use.  Regular people who have lives.

The default setting is 1mb.

This won't work because of this.
