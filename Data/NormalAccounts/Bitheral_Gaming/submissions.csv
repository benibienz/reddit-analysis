I mean the Bitherus Subreddit, You can talk about our games (Bitherus Studios) and if it's a Development Release (If I release updates with something new added or changed) then suggest what you would like to have added or changed or even removed; I listen to the community when it comes to creating games.

[Error: 0x8007045d]

The computer I am using is a HP Omni 120-1110ea AiO (All-in-One) but I had upgraded the hard drive from a Seagate 500GB 7200RPM Internal 3.5"" SATA to a Western Digital 1TB Caviar Blue 7200RPM 64MB Internal 3.5"" SATA Hard Drive

**EDIT**: I have tried the Command Prompt method (Using DiskPart) but when I try the ""create partition primary"" and hit enter it shows me with this error ""The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error""


**UPDATE 1**: I have refunded the hard drive as it was counted as a bad disk in partition wizard, so I am getting a Seagate Barricuda Internal 1TB 64MB Cache 7200RPM 3.5"" SATA 6Mb/s

**UPDATE 2**: Hello reddit, for those who have experience this problem then there may be a problem with the hard drive because when I have just replaced the hard drive, Windows is installing; I found this out because I used Hirens BootCD and Partition Wizard said that the hard drive was a bad disk, so take note of where you buy your HDD and I wouldn't recommend buying a recertified hard drive.
