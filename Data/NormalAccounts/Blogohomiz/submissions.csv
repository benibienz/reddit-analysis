I just thought it would be helpful to compile evidence that points towards another project releasing soon into one post.


**Malay Snapchat:**

* [Eating tonight](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrankOcean/comments/4yx59s/from_malays_snapchat_are_we_eating_again_tonight/)

* [Wait for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrankOcean/comments/4ywcpj/dont_know_what_to_take_from_this/)

* [It's Sunday somewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrankOcean/comments/4ywws9/my_friend_asked_malay_today_and_got_this_response/)

**Feminine/Masculine theories**

&gt;  [Frank will be releasing two versions of ""Blonde"". The one he release already was previewed with the music video for ""Nikes"". The second version is the darker side, the deeper, more rap-styled voice that was shown off in the Nikes music video](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrankOcean/comments/4yrsh7/theory_about_twooo_versions/)



&gt; [What if Blonde is just the feminine version of the album and he's going to release a masculine version some other time where each song is slightly different? So Nikes will have the deep rapping as opposed to the Frank's high pitched singing. I GOT TWOOOO VERSIONS](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrankOcean/comments/4ywt9e/what_if_new_album_theory/)

**Magazine**

* [Magazine has different tracklistings](http://pitchfork.com/news/67679-frank-ocean-drops-new-album-blonde-listen/?mbid=social_twitter)
* [Magazine has lyrics to songs that are not on Blond]
