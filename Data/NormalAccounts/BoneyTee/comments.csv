Your point about the layman's work force doesn't make any sense because I was pointing out education is more important because all these people that take algebra and what have you end up in the workforce I was referring to and NOT playing professionally.

I have a pitbull and its super friendly but 1/2 of the people that see him react with fear so I always keep him on a leesh unless i take him out in the boonies somewhere.  It sucks because one of my neighbors has a tiny little dog that behaves very poorly but they let that thing run around without a leesh all the time.  Cant tell you how many times I've seen cars stopped in front of my house because of that damn thing.
