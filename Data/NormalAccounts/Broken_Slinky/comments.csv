108,"Me and my two good friends were in a cab driving to the theater, all of us in the back seat with me in the middle. We were stuck in pretty heavy traffic in a not so great part of the city. All of us including the cab driver were pretty uneasy since just the other day some guy was shot just sitting in his car. Finally traffic started moving but not long after we were in motion there was a loud BANG. My heart dropped to my stomach and out of instinct I just dove to my left, shielding my friend in the process.

Turns out it was just a car backfiring, I sat back up and just laughed, I was just laughing to cover up the fact I was still scared as shit. I looked over to my buddy on the left and all I could see was a goofy smile on his face. He thanked me for shielding him and i just said ""no problem buddy."" I looked over at my other friend to give him that look of ""pfft, can you believe that just happened?"" And all I saw was him just staring out the window, in the reflection of the window I could just see the hurt in expression. In that moment where we all thought a gun went off, I covered someone else...not him. He never really spoke to me after that, and to make things even more awkward we were roommates. After about a year me and him drifted apart, I guess he never really got over that. I haven't even heard from the guy in years. Me and the other guy still talk though.

The thing I'm too ashamed to admit to either of them is I wasn't shielding my friend, I was shielding the sandwich I was eating.",2015-12-18 23:06:56+00:00,cy3xoue,3.0,t1_cy3rfe5,10211.0,pics

172,"There was an episode of fear factor that had these 4  people In a car. The 2 in the back were the pankees, the guy in the drivers seat was the guy that set it up, and the passenger was the pranker. 

I forget the set up but it involved the pranker pulling a knife out and as soon as he pulled it out, the guy in the back seat (guy being pranked) lunges forward, puts the guy in a head lock and proceeds to beat the hell out of the guy. All while his gf is screaming (the other one being pranked), his friend trying to pull him off, and the guy being beaten saying ""it's a prank, it's a prank, this is fear factor!"" 

It was pretty great.",2015-07-30 23:18:38+00:00,ctm5gm7,4.0,t1_ctlxphm,11880.0,gifs

Whenever you need to make a call it connects you with an interpreter so you can make calls and people can call your number and a interpreter will intercept the call for you and speak for you. My mother is deaf and uses this, it bypasses most of the phone problems you listed.
