Now some of them have moved, others have started families, and now I'm short a lot of friends.

So i decided to look for some new friends. Reddit, Facebook groups, and some other places. Each time I got responses and was happy to talk and make plans to meet and make some new friends.

Except every. single. time. it falls through, and I don't mean in the way of getting a text the day before informing of the change but a complete stop of all communication. 

Talking to someone about joining their hiking group, on the day we're supposed to meet I text to confirm the place and time...nothing. I joined and D&amp;D group, something I've been wanting to do for years and was so happy i got invited to start a new campaign, i even met them to do character construction, and am told ""we'll start on Sunday"" Saturday afternoon i text to ask where we'll be playing...yup. heard nothing back.

and these are just the two recent examples of just utter assholery, is this exclusive to San Diego? Or is it an issue in all of the larger cities? or is it just people being inconsiderate pricks?

sorry about the rant, it's just very frustrating.

He should have stayed, but not because of any strategic reasons, but because he was brought back to life by the red priestess Mel and The Lord Of Light.  For anyone that doesn't remember in season 3 Beric Dondarrian is killed by The Hound, and he was brought back to life by Thoros of Myr, a red priest. Later on Beric explains that he has been brought back to life multiple times but at a cost, every time he loses a part of himself. This is something we never saw happen to Jon, he remained the same person the whole time. The Battle of the Bastards would have been the perfect opportunity to reveal a change. As Ramsay releases Rickon and all of the fans expect Jon to rush to save his brother, he just sits there atop his horse and just stares stoned faced at Ramsay. 

This also could have made an interesting scene with Sansa afterwards, when she asks why Jon didn't try to help Rickon, Jon has no answer,  because the piece of himself that he lost was the love for his brother.

So I'm looking for some new friends that aren't boring. 

I'm pretty active, I like to do long hikes, run, and go to the gym and work out and be bored because I'd rather watch YouTube videos while I work out and not sports or the news. But, admittedly I've taken a break from the gym since I'm in real estate school and froze my membership until June 14th. But I still hike and run, but my stamina and muscle mass has taken a hit. So if you are a gym rat or a hiker, we will definitely be besties. And a hiking buddy or a gym buddy would be great.

Im a little bit of a dork, which is like a nerd without all the benefits of being super smart, but I do love to learn stuff, I'm always watching Vsauce videos on YouTube and John Greens science channel. I have a foul sense of humor and make inappropriate jokes, I make jokes that only I think are funny, I swear, I'm sarcastic, a smart ass. I also really want to join a D&amp;D group, so if you know of any that will take a beginner, hook me up.

I'm a casual drinker, I don't smoke cigarettes, I'm 420 friendly, but I'm not really a smoker.

We know that they travel with a maximum of 20 people (meaning that their group is huge if they can spare to send out 20 people) they also know Hilltop has no weapons, and that their people are cowardly and don't fight back.

The plan should have been to have Hilltop do nothing and wait for a group to come to them, setting up an ambush that they would be totally unprepared for. It would also be safe to assume that Negan would have shown up to Hilltop to give a reminder of what happens when he is disobeyed and also to kill Gregory himself.

Ricks group could have effectively killed every capable soldier of The Savior's and their leader in a single episode.
