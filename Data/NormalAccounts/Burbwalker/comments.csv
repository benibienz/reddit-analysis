The owner did not get a single bourbon that I asked for, saying that it was too short notice (and it probably was).

223,"I think when I first tried to look at your list, it just hadn't been approved by the mods yet, so I couldn't see anything.  I saw it the next day, so it should be good now.  

I went around today looking for straggler bottles of Seasoned Wood.  I've been flooded by requests for samples here and in my local group, so having another bottle would be nice. :/  I didn't have any luck finding another one though.  I did find one Baby Saz in Murfreesboro for $29!   Old Fort Parkway Wine and Spirits has 5 bottles on the shelf for $49...  Also, Grapevine W and S in Cool Springs still has WT 101 Rye.  Only place around that I've seen it. ",2016-04-25 23:09:04+00:00,d2h74pj,,t1_d2gk24l,30797.0,nashvillewhiskey

235,"u/signde pretty much covered it.  Husk is excellent.  Whiskey Kitchen has a lot of ordinary whiskey, but nothing special on their menu.

If you want really good, authentic Italian, go to Giovanni's Ristorante (http://www.opentable.com/giovannis-ristorante).  It's downtown like most of where Signde has suggested.

For sushi, hit Wild Wasabi or Ru San's.  I prefer Ru San's but it's been a while.  

Also, while I have not toured Yazoo myself, I've heard it's a good place to go.  Blackstone Brewery is also downtown and their Strawberry Picnic beer is out now, which is the only beer my wife will drink, haha.

For something special to do, I always struggle with this question, being a native Nashvillian.  There's the Country Music Hall of Fame and honky tonks on Broadway.  Hot chicken is certainly an experience.  The Frist art museum is on Broadway.

236,"I'm not looking to start a review blog or anything, but it would be nice to learn.  I was especially intrigued by Texacer's guide where he noted that learning to taste whiskey made him start to notice the flavors in all his food.  I love food, so that would be an excellent side effect.  I'm going to keep working on the Buffalo Trace, seeing if I can get a little deeper.  I've got a bottle of Stagg Jr. Batch 5 that I'll crack open as a reward for picking out 3 flavors.",2016-04-18 23:18:29+00:00,d2864mv,2.0,t1_d27r6yr,20497.0,bourbon

I switched from a rocks glass to a wine glass a while back after reading about how glass shapes affect the nose.  I was shocked at the difference it made.  I was also surprised at what a big difference resting the drink makes.  Something that tastes full of ethanol is noticeably less hot after just 10 minutes of sitting.

Cool Springs Wine and Spirits hides them away for big spenders, so no chance of picking it up there.
