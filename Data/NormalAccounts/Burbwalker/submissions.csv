My first thought was, ""They like me!  They really like me!"", and then my SECOND thought was, ""I wonder which one r/bourbon would like best?""  Being able to sell that whole barrel in a timely manner definitely matters to the store, so I thought I'd give a brief, and inept, description of what I tasted in the BT (because it was 11:45 am and I was hungry, so the Eagle Rare is a blur...) and see what you guys think!  
&amp;nbsp;  

Sample 1 - Warm, just like I would expect from a standard BT pour.  The best way I can describe this is that it was like BT on roids.  More heat, more of the standard flavor, just more.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Sample 2 - Corn.  There was less barrel influence in this sample than either of the other two, and very pronounced corn and mash.  It was my least favorite, not because it tasted bad, but because it just didn't taste right.  Less heat than Sample 1.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Sample 3 - Super soft, no heat, vanilla.  Think standard BT that had breathed for an hour, but right out of the bottle.  Personally, this was my favorite.  
&amp;nbsp;  

So for those of you who are big fans of the standard Buffalo Trace, if you were going to buy a store pick, which of those sounds best to you?

18,2016-05-01 15:47:28+00:00,self.bourbon,https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/4h9mbq/notes_from_touring_beam_willett_buffalo_trace_and/,False,"My wife and I took a trip to Louisville this weekend (Fri and Sat) and strategically hit four distilleries.  We were driving up from Nashville, South of Louisville, so naturally that played a part in the itinerary.  
&amp;nbsp;  

The short version is: really enjoyed every distillery; felt like we saw every aspect of the process between the 4 of them; every distillery offered something unique.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Beam was our first stop.  I must have missed the note in the r/bourbon guide to book 2 days in advance, and the Beam website does not ""strongly encourage"" you to make reservations in advance (unlike Willett, ironically) though you can purchase in advance.  I would suggest you do this, or have the flexibility to jump into the short tour.  We arrived 10 minutes before the Noon tour and it was full, with the next available complete tour beginning at 1:00, or a truncated tour (45 mins) was available at 1:15.  Beam uses a 20-ish passenger shuttle to get you around the property, so that's the limit a tour will hold.  We had made a 3:00 reservation for Willett (because they strongly encouraged it on their website), so we opted for the short tour at 1:15.  On the short tour, we hit the distillery, but not the bottling or rick houses.  The tasting at the end gives you two samples of pretty much their entire line, from the flavored stuff to Booker's, and you get to keep your snifter (so don't buy one in the gift shop beforehand).  We also ate lunch at the BBQ joint, which was fine, though totally inefficient for such a large tourist attraction.  What's unique is the size of their operation: Beam will fill their 14 Millionth barrel on Monday, May 2nd! A good experience overall and fun glimpse into a huge operation.  
&amp;nbsp;  


From there we went to Willett (30 mins East), which is right next door to Heaven Hill.  Willett, according to the tour guide, is slightly too big to be a ""craft distillery"", but was small enough to be a really neat comparison to Beam.  Willett strongly encourages reservations, which, as I said earlier, is ironic because it's a walking tour and the group was bigger than our group at Beam.  This was a great tour that takes you through the distillery, where you can stick a finger in and sample all the various stages of fermentation, lots of photo ops with their [unique pot still](http://i.imgur.com/wpITknq.jpg), and also a tour through their rick houses.  Currently they do not tour through the bottling room, but said they plan to do that in the future.  Finally you get a tasting, which for us included the standard stuff, plus WFE 3 year Rye and WFE 12 year SiB Bourbon (which were also for sale in the gift shop).  What's unique is the smaller scale operation, and their patented pot still. Thanks to u/theduke282 for suggesting the course correction to include this stop.  
&amp;nbsp;  

From Willett we drove to Louisville which was about an hour away.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Saturday we went to Buffalo Trace first (about an hour East of Louisville) for the normal tour (not Hard Hat, which is booked a month in advance it seems).  We had no reservations and it was no problem.  It seems they do tours every 30 minutes, which are walking tours with large groups.  Buffalo Trace is the most beautiful distillery of the 4 we saw, with old brick rick houses and set right on the river.  The regular tour takes you through a history lesson of Ky Bourbon, a rick house (specifically [Warehouse C](http://i.imgur.com/Y20fAZx.jpg) which was hit by the tornado), the bottling room, and ends with a tasting of Eagle Rare, Buffalo Trace, their White Dog (my wife's fav...), Vodka and Liqueur.  What's unique is this was the only tour that was free, the brick rick houses and just how freaking nice the whole property is.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Finally, we drove 25 minutes South from BT to Four Roses Distillery (not the bottling/rick houses which are near Beam, 45 mins away).  Four Roses is currently my favorite bourbon, so I was excited for this tour for that reason alone.  You start off with a snoozer of a video about the brand and bourbon in general, and then some history from the guide, which includes a very candid explanation of why the brand was garbage until the late 90s/ early 2000s, when Rutledge brought it back.  After that you tour the distillery and get to sample the vats (which are made of [wood](http://i.imgur.com/qLLiTHs.jpg)!), and then you taste all three standard Four Roses offerings, which was a great comparison, and you also get to keep your glass.  What's unique is the story behind the brand, the recipes and the architecture.  
&amp;nbsp;

All in all this was a very easy 2 day trip, and it might have been possible to cram another stop in each day, but most of these places are quite a drive from one another, which, for me (who is not a great planner according to my wife), makes it difficult to pre-schedule tours because I don't want to rush around.  I feel like I got a good and un-repetitive sample of pretty much the whole bourbon process in just 4 stops, too, which I'm really happy about.",bourbon,"Notes from Touring Beam, Willett, Buffalo Trace and Four Roses this weekend",https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/4h9mbq/notes_from_touring_beam_willett_buffalo_trace_and/

I am really NOT a fan of the Orphan Barrel project, but I bought 3 bottles of the crap before I knew any better, so I figure I might as well round it out for the novelty of having a whole set.  I also thought I might find a store big enough in Tullahoma to have gotten a bottle of Seasoned Wood that nobody picked up. (Wrong.)

So I drove down and hit a liquor store who I found on Facebook had advertised having some decent stuff last Winter.  If he had good stuff then, it's all gone, except for a bottle ETL that he wanted $100 for... All his prices were crazy, and I was immediately regretting driving down there. I went to 5 other stores, none of whom had anything good.  

As I was giving up and coming home, I decided to stop at a little store that I had skipped, because hey, I'm an optimist, and the good stuff could always be right around the corner!  I walked in the door and there was a bottle of Rhetoric 21 on the counter ... for $225.  There was also Gifted Horse, $225; Forged Oak, $225; and Barterhouse, $225.  

Dumbfounded and too Southern to tell the lady how stupid those prices are, I went and browsed the shelves, where low and behold, there was a bottle of Eagle Rare, age stated 10 years on the neck ($30), 2 bottles of Booker's 2013-06 ($60) and another Booker's 2014-07 ($60).  I may have been overly excited due to how depressing the rest of the hunt was, but I bought all 3 and left the other 2013-06 for somebody else who might want to take a drive.",nashvillewhiskey,Went to Tullahoma and Manchester today,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashvillewhiskey/comments/4grzli/went_to_tullahoma_and_manchester_today/
