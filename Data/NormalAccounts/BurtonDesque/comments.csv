450,"&gt;  Why dont u believe in God?

You know all that evidence god exists?   Yeah, neither do I.

&gt; Why do u believe in the fact the we came from monkeys?

Because it's a fact.

&gt; Why do u think that there was a big explosion an man in all it's beauty was formed?

The Big Bang was over 13 billion years ago.  The Earth did not form until 4.6 billion years ago.  Human beings as a species are about 200,000 years old.

IOW, your question is stupid and shows you have NO idea what you're talking about.

&gt;  Do you think if you scatter some legos on the floor it would build itself?

No.

&gt; How do u think the world was formed?

Gradual accretion from the planetary disk 4.6 billion years ago.

&gt; How do u think u wake up every day?

Changes in brain activity patterns.

&gt; How do u think you we're created!?

By my parents having sex.

&gt; What made u believe that the Bible is wrong? 

It says things that are blatantly false or simply not backed up by any facts.

&gt; What about the signs of the time in revelation as we can clearly prophecy is being revealed!

That's bullshit.  Christians have been saying ""Any day now"" for 2000 years.

&gt; How long have u been an Atheist?

The word atheist is not a proper noun and I've been one for about 35 years now.

&gt; How the hell do u think they the world began!?

You asked this already.

&gt; Where u just nothing? And how do u think u came to existence?

Through the processes of fertilization and fetal development.

&gt; Don't u love God?

No, as there is no such thing to love.

&gt; What about when God comes? What will happen to u?

Never going to happen.

&gt; Do u think u have to serve God out of fear?

I don't think I have to serve god at all.

&gt; Do u think it's a sin to be gay?

Sin is an imaginary disease designed to sell you an imaginary cure.

&gt; You people are the perfect definition of Satan he has made u twist around the word of God to fit your needs but why did u twist around the word of God?

I don't.  I don't care about the so-called 'word of god'.

&gt; Do u know the difference between right and wrong?

Yes.  Indeed, study after study shows that atheists behave more morally than theists do.

&gt;  Or do u make sins seem correct when they are wrong?

Sin does not exist.

&gt; If you had 24 hours to live would you turn to God?

Which one?

&gt; Are you afraid of God?

No more than I'm afraid of Voldemort.

&gt; Do you believe Satan exist?

No.

The technique of mindfulness is easy:  PAY ATTENTION!  

The difficulty is in maintaining being present in this moment 100%.  Slowly quieting your mind with mediation greatly helps in this.

For meditation, here's a technique that's been taught to beginners for centuries:  Put yourself in a posture where you can breathe freely from the diaphragm.  Breathe in, letting the diaphragm do the work.  As you exhale count off ""one"" in your mind.  Repeat this up to ""ten"" and then start over.  If you lose count, and you will, go back to ""one"".

Do this for at least 5 minutes a day and try to do it at the same time each day.  IOW, make the practice part of your daily routine.

There.  I have now taught you the techniques that have served great Zen Masters for their whole lives.  Books and podcasts are not necessary and usually are of little help.  They are like reading a menu.  Only you can actually eat the food.  

There is no substitute for actual practice.  Now just DO IT.",2016-03-31 17:12:39+00:00,d1knaaq,1.0,t3_4cq5ue,11042.0,atheism

1505,"&gt; still stay firm in my belief

A belief you freely admit is built on ignorance.

&gt; I do know that the Bible also tells us to love one another

Jesus told Jews to love one another, as he clearly stated he was speaking to no other group.  Later on others in the New Testament said that only applied to Christians.  Why don't you follow the Bible in this?

&gt; And sadly, I do believe that, yes. As crazy as that sounds, if there's a Heaven, then there has to be a Hell. 

Why is it sad?  You're supposed to be joyful you get to go to Heaven and glad we non-believers get what we deserve.  The Bible says so.

Of course all this begs the question why you believe the Bible at all in the first place, as there is NO evidence for any of its supernatural claims.",2016-02-20 09:03:49+00:00,d06wfsc,3.0,t1_d06wdco,275.0,atheism

The New Testament tells Christians to shun non-Christians.

1510,"My dad died this week.  His instructions to me were explicit:  No wake.  No funeral.  No memorial service.  No obituaries.  NO NOTHING.  Just cremation and interring the ashes in my mom's grave.

In his early retirement he had managed the graveyard of his church.  He grew to dislike all the fuss over death people made.  I think it was part of what turned him into an atheist and anti-theist in his old age.

Today, though, my aunt, his sister, called me and asked me why she had not heard about any arrangements I might have made.  I told her there were none to tell her about.  She KNEW this was his wish but she still got mad at me for actually obeying it.  She went on and on about how upset my mother would have been in an attempt to guilt trip me.  Finally, I just said, ""That's what he wanted so that's what he's getting and that's the end of it.""

I expect to get more of an earful later.

As they say, funerals are for the living.  Though I understand and agree with my father's sentiment I also understand that some people want or even need some sort of closure when a person dies - some sort of ceremony or gathering to remember them by and say your goodbye.

Part of me wishes my dad had agreed to some sort of memorial gathering if for no other reason than to make my life right now a little smoother.  The bigger part of me is royally pissed at my aunt.

So, right now, I'd have to say I'm somewhat conflicted on the subject of your inquiry.  ",2016-02-20 06:46:01+00:00,d06u2sk,1.0,t3_46ow4y,3017.0,atheism

1892,"&gt; Are there contemporary writings where people mention Buddha?

There isn't much of anything in the way of contemporary writings from the Buddha's time.  It was not a literate society.  However, other oral traditions that come from that period, like the Jains', mention him.

&gt; Did early worshipers

Most Buddhists will tell you the Buddha shouldn't be worshiped.  He was not a god.

&gt; seem to know when/where he was born/died?

Yes.  These places are mentioned in the Sutras.  In particular, the Buddha mentions four places that his followers could venerate him at if they chose to:  Lumbini, where he was born; Bodh Gaya, where he attained enlightenment; Sarnath, where he first taught, and the place of his upcoming death, which turned out to be Kushinagar.  All four of these places had temples or stupas at them not long after his supposed death.  The emperor Ashoka is recorded as having improvements made at each and doing pilgrimages to them.

Indeed, Ashoka holds much the same place in Buddhism that Constantine does in Christianity.

Furthermore, there are the ruins of Buddhist monasteries in a number of the places mentioned in the Sutras, though the physical remains come from after the time he supposedly lived.

This is basically why I think the Buddha existed.  There were these monastic communities that were clearly Buddhist and who said they were founded years earlier by this one guy.  There's no reason to think they were lying and the story makes perfect sense in its time and place.  Of course, this is only circumstantial evidence.

Christianity, on the other hand, appears to have started out as a cult of a divine heavenly Christ that only later developed a story of a flesh and blood Jesus to go along with it.",2016-02-07 19:35:49+00:00,czrbjzg,3.0,t1_czr709e,7544.0,atheism

1902,"I think it is more likely the Buddha existed.

If you look at the writings about Jesus, you find that the ones talking about a heavenly divine Christ actually predate the ones talking about a flesh and blood Jesus.  This is particularly glaring in the writings attributed to Paul.  This makes Jesus seem like an afterthought.

As for the Buddha, if you strip away the fantastical aspects of what is presented in the Sutras about his life, which are things typical of the religious writings of that time in India, you are left with the tale of a wandering holy man who gathered a group of followers around him to live by and spread his Dharma.  There's nothing strange or unusual about that especially given the time and place he supposedly lived in.  When you couple that with the fact that there is physical evidence that there were Buddhist monastic communities in existence not long after he supposedly lived, it lends credence to the idea that he was an actual person.

That said, we cannot be sure that anything that is written about what he said and did is in any way accurate.  That includes his existing in the first place.

To me, the key difference is that if these men existed they were both itinerant teachers within the religious traditions in existence in their time and place.  For the Buddha and Buddhism that really presents no problem.   For Jesus and Christianity it is catastrophic.  Some guy wandering around Judea preaching doesn't make you the only son of the one true god.

If the Jesus who existed was not as the Gospels portray him then Christianity is false.  If the Buddha was not who the Sutras portray him as that doesn't really affect living by the Eightfold Path.",2016-02-07 10:51:28+00:00,czqy8b0,1.0,t3_44kr92,8644.0,atheism

2582,"Hinduism is certainly not a non-theistic religion.

However, as I'm a Buddhist priest myself, let's look at the Four Noble Truths as they relate to you.  They say that if you don't want to suffer you must follow the Eightfold Path:

Right View  
Right Intention  
Right Speech  
Right Action  
Right Livelihood  
Right Effort  
Right Mindfulness  
Right Concentration

So, you're in the 3rd year of university.  That makes your Right Action, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Intention, Right View and Right Livelihood clear - Study hard and do well in school while being kind to others.

That leaves the other two:  Right Concentration and Right Speech.

Stress is a burden on college students.  It is a great source of suffering.  I therefore suggest you do things to relieve those sorts of things.  Exercise is good and so is meditation.  I suggest you try meditating 10 minutes a day.  It will give your mind a much needed break.

As for Right Speech, if you tell your family and friends you're trying to follow the Eightfold Path as it relates to a college student, that will probably go a long way to putting their minds at ease.  If they continue to pressure you remember not to give way to anger, especially in your speech.

It might not hurt to move out of the house if you can regardless.",2016-01-21 08:45:30+00:00,cz6bcwk,1.0,t3_41z1x9,1104.0,atheism

Hitler was a Catholic in good standing with the Church until the day he died.  His writings and speeches are filled with references to god and Christianity.

Death is like a floating cloud which disappears.

It is pure and clear, not depending on life and death.

2895,"&gt; This is what I believe to be the truth.

There is a problem with your belief.  For it to be true Christianity would have to be the most perfect moral code ever conceived of.  It is not.  Jesus' philosophy, as presented in the Gospels, is morally and intellectually inferior, not just to ones that have come since, such as secular humanism, but to some that predate Christianity.

For example, the moral codes of Buddhism and Jainism are both superior to the moral code of Christianity and predate it by over 500 years.

&gt; you are open to the idea of following the teachings of God, if the information presented made complete sense to you. Is that correct? 

Not quite.  It would not only have to make sense to me but would also have to align with my own moral code.

""Let’s say that the consensus is that our species, being the higher primates, Homo Sapiens, has been on the planet for at least 100,000 years, maybe more. Francis Collins says maybe 100,000. Richard Dawkins thinks maybe a quarter-of-a-million. I’ll take 100,000. 

""In order to be a Christian, you have to believe that for 98,000 years, our species suffered and died, most of its children dying in childbirth, most other people having a life expectancy of about 25 years, dying of their teeth. Famine, struggle, bitterness, war, suffering, misery, all of that for 98,000 years. Heaven watches this with complete indifference. 

""And then 2000 years ago, thinks 'That’s enough of that. It’s time to intervene,' and the best way to do this would be by condemning someone to a human sacrifice somewhere in the less literate parts of the Middle East. Don’t let us appeal to the Chinese, for example, where people can read and study evidence and have a civilization. Let’s go to the desert and have another revelation there. This is nonsense. It can’t be believed by a thinking person.""

You can apply this logic to every form of theism.

Then there's the Problem of Evil, neatly summarized by Epicurus:

""Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.  
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.  
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?  
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?""

You dehumanised them with beatings and exquisite torture, gouged out their eyes, slit their tongues, stretched, crushed, or broke their limbs, tore off their breasts if they were women, crushed their scrotums if they were men, imprisoned them, stabbed them, disembowelled them, hanged them, burnt them alive.

&gt; Let's assume God is the force behind this universe, or some guy in an alternate dimension who simulated our universe.. or whatever. I don't understand why he/she needs to care about one or two people suffering on this planet in the middle of nowhere. 

This is deism.  It posits a god that doesn't give a shit about you.  In practical terms that's about the same as there not being any god at all.

&gt; A Muslim Kim Davis? She'd have been dead just for looking at another man

That is so ridiculously and falsely hyperbolic as to be utterly laughable.

&gt; For the Muslim attitude to adultery (zina) from an Imam

That's one Imam giving his opinion and you take that to mean that all Muslims think that way?  Seriously?

&gt; How many of these peaceful and innocent Muslims think LGBT people should be 'legally' killed by the state?

&gt; Well I can tell you the figure it is in Britain - from the government's own data - and it's 100%.

4729,"&gt; idea of God just makes less sense more I think it.

That's the way gods are, the Christian one included.  Christianity claims their god is a number of self-contradictory things all at once, so of course it makes no logical sense.

For example, the Christian god is supposedly ""all loving"" but will, of its own free choice, send most of the people who've ever lived to eternal fiery torment.  Those two things are self-contradictory.  Either the Christian god is all loving and no one gets sent to Hell or it's the most horrible sadist imaginable.  It can't be both.

&gt; I don't know anything besides Christianity.

That's okay.  Many of us, myself included, were in the same place as you at one point.  Here's a book that helped me see beyond that:  [*The Story of My Experiments with Truth* by Mohandas Gandhi] (http://www.amazon.com/Story-My-Experiments-Truth-Autobiography/dp/1499142471/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447342392&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=my+experiments+with+truth).  While he was a devout Hindu, Gandhi was devoted to the idea that living according to what is true is the most important thing in life.

My transition to being an atheist began when I realized that not all religions can be true, but they can all be false.  I then came to see that the supernatural claims of Christianity were no more valid than the claims of other theistic religions.  I therefore saw I had no basis or reason for being a Christian any longer.

It was a very liberating experience.

&gt; I know this Forum is propably meant for atheists, but I could really use other viewpoint now.

Santa Claus for adults

• Why don’t you believe in God?

There is no evidence any god or gods exist.

• How to you think life came to be?

abiogenesis.


• Did you believe in God before? What made you stop?

Yes.  Realizing there was no rational reason to continue to believe.

• What would have to occur in order for you to at least consider the possibility of God?

Ask god.  He'll know what it would take.

• Do you believe science can answer all questions?

No.

• What was the influence of religion on humanity?

""Religion poisons everything.""

• How deep is your knowledge of other religions?

Quite extensive actually.

• Were you raised as an atheist? If not, why did you leave your religion?

You've already asked these two questions.

• What is your evidence against the existence of God?

Atheism does not require evidence.  It is the null hypothesis.

• What do you think happens after life?

Nothing.

• What is the purpose of life?

Whatever you decide to make it.

• Do you see Atheism as a religion in and of itself, a way of life or a philosophy?

No, as I never said that.

&gt; Or the part where you said he was a hypocrite for criticizing them?

He wasn't criticizing the Church, so again, you're trying to say I said something I did not.

He gives money.  He gives his time to the Church.  IOW, he is an active member of the Church despite all the bad shit it does.  That makes him complicit.

&gt; Colbert can be a good person and a Catholic

Given how horrific the Catholic Church is that statement is HIGHLY debatable.

5356,"&gt; 2 people told me that I could ask question here on this sub, and people are very active in having brainy conversation. But... I'm quite skeptical.

Free hint:  People are more likely to engage you in civil conversation if you don't insult them first.

&gt; Do you think that people who have no kids and no intention of having kids deserve the same right to marry as the people who have, say 3, or 5 kids? You can answer with ""yes"", ""no"" or you can explain.

Most people have no children when they marry.  Are you suggesting that only people who already have kids should be able to get married?

Also, you seem to fundamentally misunderstand that marriage is primarily a civil contract between the two people getting married.  What does that have to do with having children or not?

&gt; question 2: Would you rather be a nerd or a jock?

This is a false dichotomy.  When I was younger I was both.  Now I'm too old to be a jock anymore.

&gt; Do you know what the ""non sequitur"" argument is?

Yes.

&gt; These are a bunch of tough questions

No, they're not tough.  They're STUPID.

He has not done nearly enough regarding the pedophiles and their protectors in the Church.

Women and homosexuals are still something less than fully human in the Church's eyes.

He says the rich need to do more to help the poor, but he still hasn't sold his golden throne or done much of anything else to increase the amount his very rich church helps them.

He is no friend of free speech.

He was an ally of the brutal Argentine Junta.

He is only liberal in comparison to his two immediate predecessors. He is part of the reactionary wing of the Church.

You outlawed them from the universities or any teaching careers, besmirched their reputations, banned or burned their books or their writings of any kind, drove them into exile, humiliated them, seized their properties, arrested them for blasphemy. You dehumanised them with beatings and exquisite torture, gouged out their eyes, slit their tongues, stretched, crushed, or broke their limbs, tore off their breasts if they were women, crushed their scrotums if they were men, imprisoned them, stabbed them, disembowelled them, hanged them, burnt them alive.

You outlawed them from the universities or any teaching careers, besmirched their reputations, banned or burned their books or their writings of any kind, drove them into exile, humiliated them, seized their properties, arrested them for blasphemy. You dehumanised them with beatings and exquisite torture, gouged out their eyes, slit their tongues, stretched, crushed, or broke their limbs, tore off their breasts if they were women, crushed their scrotums if they were men, imprisoned them, stabbed them, disembowelled them, hanged them, burnt them alive.

And you have nerve enough to complain to me that I laugh at you.”

Essentially, it hinges on just TWO observable facts:

1.  Red shifting.  The light we observe from objects in the Universe is shifted towards the red.  This is due to an effect analogous to the Doppler Effect with sound.  Furthermore, the farther an object is from the Earth the faster it appears to be moving away from us.  This observation means the Universe is expanding.  That means a moment ago it used to be smaller.  An a moment before that, smaller still.  Run that backwards long enough (13+ billion years) and the Universe was apparently just a point.

As opposed to Muslims, whose holy book says to kill we atheists, and Christians, whose holy book says we should be shunned and will burn for eternity?  

You theists are in NO place to lecture us about thin skins.  Indeed, you remind me of this quote:

“I'll tell you what you did with atheists for about 1500 years. You outlawed them from the universities or any teaching careers, besmirched their reputations, banned or burned their books or their writings of any kind, drove them into exile, humiliated them, seized their properties, arrested them for blasphemy. You dehumanised them with beatings and exquisite torture, gouged out their eyes, slit their tongues, stretched, crushed, or broke their limbs, tore off their breasts if they were women, crushed their scrotums if they were men, imprisoned them, stabbed them, disembowelled them, hanged them, burnt them alive.

And you have nerve enough to complain to me that I laugh at you.”

7030,"&gt; ""Why Buddha explained Christianity better than Jesus""

See, to me, as a former Christian who is now a Buddhist priest, this title in and of itself screams ""BULLSHIT!"".  If you look at the tenets of Buddhism and Christianity it quickly becomes quite obvious that they are very, very different.  There is little in common between the two and where they do coincided it is on things that are common to many, many religions.  

These commonalities are notions like ""Thou shalt not kill"" and 'Be kind to each other'.  These ideas are so pervasive among our religions that we can ascribe them appearing in both Buddhism and Christianity as being a mere coincidence.

If you claim the Buddha explained Christianity better than Jesus what you're really saying is that you're picturing a Christianity that is not like the Christianity presented in the Bible, but is a Christianity you really desperately wish existed in its place.  

Buddhism is a kinder, gentler, more forgiving religion than Christianity.  You don't see the Buddha calling people ""dogs"", smiting fig trees in fits of pique or telling his followers to shun non-believers.  You don't see the Buddha preaching an apocalyptic message and, most of all, the Buddha does not preach a message of self-glorifying self-deification and eternal fiery punishment for non-conformists.

At its heart Buddhism teaches kindness.  Christianity dose not.  Things like the Golden Rule are peripheral to its central tenets which are obedience, subjugation and intolerance.  Lots of people WISH Christianity were more like Buddhism so they invent silly  notions like 'the Buddha explained Christianity better than Jesus'.

Jesus explained Christianity just fine.  That is why Christianity is so different than Buddhism.  Arguing otherwise is just wishful thinking.",2015-08-18 16:01:27+00:00,cu75dyi,3.0,t1_cu6ztms,9562.0,atheism

I think there is a problem with the notion of karma if you ascribe things that happen to you as being caused by it.  That sort of thinking leads to thinking things like 'the Jews brought the Holocaust on themselves'.  

I look at karma on a more personal level as ""You make; you get"".  IOW, we tend to get back from people what we give them.  If I'm nice to you you'll probably be nice back.  If I'm a jerk to you you'll probably be a jerk back.",2015-08-11 22:33:04+00:00,ctzp6gg,13.0,t1_ctzor91,691.0,atheism

Except, clearly, when it comes to believing in a deity for which there is NO evidence.

&gt; do you hate all Christians regardless of their opinions

We're the haters here?  Seriously?

“I'll tell you what you did with atheists for about 1500 years. You outlawed them from the universities or any teaching careers, besmirched their reputations, banned or burned their books or their writings of any kind, drove them into exile, humiliated them, seized their properties, arrested them for blasphemy. You dehumanised them with beatings and exquisite torture, gouged out their eyes, slit their tongues, stretched, crushed, or broke their limbs, tore off their breasts if they were women, crushed their scrotums if they were men, imprisoned them, stabbed them, disembowelled them, hanged them, burnt them alive.

And you have nerve enough to complain to me that I laugh at you.”

― Madalyn Murray O'Hair

&gt; Are we chill?

As long as your fellow believers keep slandering and persecuting we atheists the answer is ""no"".  You should be out there talking to them, not to us.

When you Christians all stop saying we should be discriminated against, assaulted, jailed or killed, and stop doing those sort of things, then, and only then, will we be on an even standing.

You outlawed them from the universities or any teaching careers, besmirched their reputations, banned or burned their books or their writings of any kind, drove them into exile, humiliated them, seized their properties, arrested them for blasphemy. You dehumanised them with beatings and exquisite torture, gouged out their eyes, slit their tongues, stretched, crushed, or broke their limbs, tore off their breasts if they were women, crushed their scrotums if they were men, imprisoned them, stabbed them, disembowelled them, hanged them, burnt them alive.

And you have nerve enough to complain to me that I laugh at you.”

I've seen my children discriminated against in their public school for not being believers.  I've had a family member maimed for not believing in Allah.

And yet you have the gall to tell me that we atheists are the mean unreasonable ones.

8565,"To quote /u/SerialAntagonist:

Hippie Jesus was a pacifist. The Jesus of the Bible was not.

&gt; ""Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword."" (Matthew 10:34)   
""For I have come to turn 'a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law--a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.'"" (Matthew 10:35-36)  
""'But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me.'"" (Luke 19:27)  
He said to them, ""But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one."" (Luke 22:36)  
So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. (John 2:15)

Note that all four canonical Gospels were written after the Great Revolt and the subsequent destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, so those writers would of necessity downplay those aspects of Jesus's life and teachings.

There was some frustration among the other members of Genesis over the fact that Peter got all the press.  That played a small part in his leaving, as did his realization that the rest of the band would not give him as much control as he'd had over *The Lamb* again.

Do you deliberately try to sound like an ignorant hick, or does it just come naturally?

As for your point, Jesus said something about those complaining about the speck in someone else's eye when they have a log in their own.  Also:

“I'll tell you what you did with atheists for about 1500 years. You outlawed them from the universities or any teaching careers, besmirched their reputations, banned or burned their books or their writings of any kind, drove them into exile, humiliated them, seized their properties, arrested them for blasphemy. You dehumanised them with beatings and exquisite torture, gouged out their eyes, slit their tongues, stretched, crushed, or broke their limbs, tore off their breasts if they were women, crushed their scrotums if they were men, imprisoned them, stabbed them, disembowelled them, hanged them, burnt them alive.

And you have nerve enough to complain to me that I laugh at you.”
