47,"As for myself, I YouTube'd the name ""Lana Del Rey"" in April of 2012 because I had seen the name floating around Twitter so much and was extremely curious (the name itself really catches one's attention). The first song I heard was Born To Die, and I thought it was rather creepy honestly. For some reason, though, I began to hear more of her. I clearly recall walking through a flea market in languid Summertime heat with the National Anthem demo playing through my headphones (at the time I thought that was the official version! It wasn't until much later that I heard the real orchestral-y track). I then told my close friends about her and my love grew and grew and grew like the Grinch's heart. This past May, I finally got the chance to see my queen live! It was my Christmas gift! I set off with one of my best friends whom I introduced Lana to, a fellow devoted fan, and embarked on an 8 hour drive to Dallas, TX where we were both right against the baracade in the pit amid 20,000 other fans. Sadly, the concert ended up getting canceled that night due to ""severe storms"" (DALLAS WAS AS DRY AS A BONE, BTW). That was probably one of the saddest nights I had in a while. However, the pain has seen eased and I'm loving Honeymoon fiercely. I'm very excited to hear everyone's story! ",2015-10-19 03:50:31+00:00,cw4taam,1.0,t3_3pb72v,523.0,lanadelrey
