33,"What you said for Beta is pretty subjective, so I won't touch it. I will, on the other hand, give a counter argument for Earthlings. 

&gt;I don't mind seeing Smoky beat Jasper, but it was bullshit to have her stomp all over her without breaking a sweat especially since Amethyst couldn't do a thing to her normally. And that's not to mention just how stupidly handled Jasper is: for someone who's hyped up as an ultimate supersoldier, she had one good fight with Garnet before turning into a chumpish jobber for all her other appearances.

I've mentioned this before, but experience/power doesn't necessarily mean you'll win every fight against a weaker/less experienced soldier. 
Plus, she seemed to be the one more in control of Malachite and nearly defeated Alexandrite as her. Not to mention that Steven, Connie and Amethyst aren't exactly slouches when it comes to fighting.  

&gt;their attempt at making you feel sorry for her was laughable: she's a sadistic, abusive, genocidal asshole who deserves no sympathy after what she did to Lapis, those poor corrupted Gems, and especially Amethyst.

Just because a character is cold hearted and evil, doesn't necessarily mean you can't feel sorry for her. Corruption looks like a painful/terrible process, if monster reunion taught us anything. I never really got a sadistic or genocidal feel from her. I got more 'soldier that takes to much pride in her superiority over other gems'. 

&gt;And the whole thing where she originally served Pink Diamond just felt like a plot twist for the sake of having a plot twist with no buildup whatsoever.

I wouldn't say there was *no* buildup. In Jailbreak, we see the homeworld symbol has three Diamonds. In Sworn to the sword and it could've been great, we get subtle hints that there was a fourth Pink Diamond.

I believe that the difference between less than 1000 comments v 3000 comments in the episode discussion thread here on reddit implies a BIG difference between fan interest in an episode involving Gems and an episode perceived to be filler.

I think that's more of a lack of content to talk about rather than disappointment and uninterest in those episodes. Mindful Education was about dealing with anxiety, had a great Garnet/Stevonnie, and Steven coming to terms with the people he's hurt. Future Boy Zoltron was about Steven pretending to be a robot and Smiley's old partner.

Not really? At least, I don't think so. Sometimes the perfect set up for an episode Is for the characters to interact with each other or be put into a situation. (Hit the Diamond and Know your Fusion) It's all from Steven's POV, but that doesn't mean EVERY episode needs to have him grow and learn. He'd become pretty unstoppable if that happened.

95,"&gt;Garnet ignored Amethyst's protests when they formed Sugilite. That was not cool.

You're definitely right, but I feel like she did that out of anger and frustration. They had to destroy the tower *again* and Pearl led them on a wild goose chase just for quick moments of being Sardonyx. The episode never says ""this is the right way to fuse"". Plus, that's probably the only time where she forces someone to fuse with her. Pearl and Amethyst agreed to the first time, and when Peridot got startled by Garnet wanting to fuse with her, she responded with ""Hah, I get it—you're not ready, that's fair. Another time then."" You're right that she never asks to fuse and that's probably not the best thing, but she rarely *forces* others to fuse with her.

112,"&gt;No. Cooperklebba. Sadie and Lars did speak, so did Smiley. But all the other 'likable' people were silent cameos while Steven acted like a robot in a way that doesn't actually follow last week's episode at all.

Steven decided to watch horror movies with Ronaldo, Lars, and Sadie an episode after 'On the Run' where he watched two family members fight. Steven has a tendency to bounce back after dramatic events. That's one of the reasons why he's such a great character in my eyes. After all he's been through, he's still a goofball at heart.

&gt;For a moment Mr. Frowney did seem to be bringing an interesting and uniquely Steven Universe sense of ominousness and unease. But then it turned out his dialogue was just poorly written.

This is pretty subjective. I think his dialogue was fine for a depressed person and wasn't poorly written at all. But to each their own.

&gt;As for the debate that this was about depressed people, failed comedians or gay people -- my complaint is that it clearly is not because they didn't devote enough effort into saying anything of value that resonated in any genuine way about those things. Frowney's dialouge was even deliberately a repetition of Jasper at one point rather than any REAL sort of character expression. The dialogue overall was rather heavily biased towards Steven nattering on in a manner which reminded me of why people found him annoying in season one.

Again, very subjective. I thought the moral was pretty clear that when someone is just naturally depressed, you shouldn't force them to be happy. You she make them feel comfortable. I've seen quite a few people who got that message from this episode. But again, to each their own.

&gt;It actually focused a lot more clearly on the idea that Steven had no idea how to relate to a stranger than anything else.

I'm not sure how it's a repeat. Greg disliked Marty and Marty didn't respect Greg. Smiley and Frowny do seem to respect each other, but Frowny was just too depressing to be around.

&gt;So why do they do these slice of life episodes and THEN undermine the world building they are doing? It ticks me off when they give superpowers to the ordinary humans as if they felt like messing with the world building by incorporating cartoon physics wasn't disruptive enough. The episode wasn't even interesting so deciding to make 'Mr. Smiley is freakishly stronk' the punch line to a joke is even less logical. There is a borderline weird acceptability to it when Onion's half vegetable status is ominously hinted at -- but that gets undermined when Mr. Smiley has Steven-strength.

4.) An Optimus that constantly questions his ability to lead the Autobots.

5.) A Megatron that has a deep origin story that explains his desire to conquer Cybertron and bring peace through tyranny.

My point, or ""beef"", that I was trying to make is that I don't agree with you when you say this makes Greg rotten and manipulative. We've all made at least one bad choice because it felt just good/convenient. But again, this is all up for interpretation.

How is him simply asking for the remote dismantle the idea that he wants to spend time with his son? 

&gt;We see them hanging out all the time!

You're somewhat right about this. But since we don't know how much time goes by in-between episodes, or what's going on in-between episodes, we can't say for sure how much time they actually spend together. But one things for sure, it's limited. 

Greg: But, won't I get in the way of your training?

Pearl: *off-screen, quickly reacts* YES!

It's heavily implied that once Steven started training/living with the gems, he spent less time with his dad. Even if Greg got visits once every couple weeks, he's still separated from the person he raised for over ten years of his life. It's not morally right, definitely, but it's not completely out of character for him.

Yes, faking an injury was probably the worst option, but it doesn't dehumanize him at all. If anything, it just makes him more human. Just because you're a good person doesn't mean you're immune to making bad decisions.

In Greg's defense, we've all had those moments where we did something bad and we knew it was bad, but it *felt* good. And when Greg realized the actual damaged he caused, he genuinely felt guilty and tried to fix things. Yes, he lies and that shouldn't be shrugged off. But it's not coming from a need for self-gain.

170,"&gt;She is still trying to convert her own followers to giving up their own ambitions of freedom as Gems so they can believe in her dream of a beautiful living planet.

She isn't? She's kinda dead? I'm not exactly sure what you mean by this.

&gt;Rose's plan with Steven isn't to win a final showdown with Homeworld -- it is to finish her battle to convince the Gems she led to believe in her cause and accept her victory as the desired goal. Steven was in much better a position to negotiate with the cluster shards to bubble and commune with each other rather than destroy Earth -- because as Rose's son who destroyed his mother by being born without having meant to do so his take on the cluster's options was much less manipulative and self serving than a mind meld with Rose would have been. After all, it is looking like Rose may have set up her followers to be sorted into the cluster experiment after all - there might be some shards left that resent her for leading them to be shattered while she emerged unscathed. Steven was a necessary gesture of solidarity she needed to take to face the these followers and lead them to somehow protect Earth and turn on Homeworld one more time.

While this is possible, there's one flaw in it. There's no solid evidence that says Rose knew about the cluster, or even that homeworld would ever return. The most we have is Garnet saying ""Rose couldn't have known"" and even then it's just Ruby Sapphire reacting to the forced fusion experiments.

My main headcannon for Rose wanting Steven is that she felt guilty about all the crystal gems that died/corrupted because of her somewhat selfish desires. (Just wanting to liberate earth.)

190,"Is there a difference between self insert and point of view? EVERYONE thinks they're the hero of their own story.

&gt;Making the story look and feel more like a sci-fi fanfic than a story about his son's dead mother who left a buttload of **heroic quest BS** for him to handle is kind of sweet.

I'm not sure what you mean by heroic quest BS. Rose had no way of knowing that homeworld would return or a giant cluster of shards was gonna destroy earth. While the reason for Rose wanting to make Steven is still mostly unclear, it was probably because she wanted to bridge the world's of Gem and human in a way she couldn't.

&gt;But it is also really really tired because we don't know the actual story behind the Gems well enough to want the fanfic version featuring an impossibly 'awesome' Greg.

But the backstory episodes aren't about the gems. It's about the relationship between Greg and Rose. And Greg isn't impossibly awesome. In *We need to talk*, he realizes that they just jumped into this relationship and that they don't actually know each other. In *Greg the Babysitter*, he learns that he's been mooching off of Vidalia (and Rose to a lesser extent) and he needs to take more responsibility for himself. Yes, he technically wins every time. But the same can be said about Steven. He literally saw himself die in *Steven and the Stevens* and makes an upbeat song about it.

&gt;But it DEFINITELY keeps him from actually telling it like it was enough for us to deduce any hard truths about the Gem situation.

Again, why would the crew go through the trouble of making backstory episodes if they weren't true? Why would they show us so much of Rose and Greg's relationship if it was exaggerated. It would be like if the show ended on the 'it was all just a dream' or if the video in *Lion 3* was just an elaborate prank by Amethyst for laughs. What would be the reason for spending so much time, money, and resources on backstory episodes if they're just self insert fanfics?

191,"&gt;Greg literally lampshaded that he was a 'Marty Sue' with his 'This time with Marty' announcement in Story for Steven.

I think that was just a throwaway line/a reason for Greg to tell the story to Steven again so the audience can hear it.

&gt;Young Greg has been a literal Marty Sue stand in for the 'fanfic' writer because Greg has been telling his stories to Steven in that style: More comfy than plotworthy.

While Greg's backstory episodes are more ""comfy"" than other episodes, they're still plotworthy. They tell us how Greg and Rose met, what their relationship was like and what problems they faced, and how Greg started taking responsibility for himself and working at the carwash. How is that not plotworthy?

&gt;Every episode that Young Greg has appeared has been Greg telling the story.

Just because it's Greg telling the story and it's about himself, doesn't mean he's exaggerating for Steven's sake. (Plus, we've seen Marty in present day and he's just as much a jerk as he was in Greg's story. If that's true, then everything else is probably true to.) It's sort of an unwritten rule that backstory/flashback episodes need to be 100% accurate. Why would the crew make a backstory for Greg if it's not true?

&gt;Greg's money mooching in the last episode was shown as an easily overcome 'obstacle' which he just decided to change in a Mary Sue way without any actual challenges.

This is kinda subjective. While it was somewhat easy to overcome, all he really needed was a good job, I think it still counts as a big flaw he had to fix.

&gt;Because the actual challenge in the episode was Rose being a dork who almost got Sour Cream killed because she was so stupid about her beloved Greg-like humans. The portrayal of 'The Great Rose Quartz' as a complete moron is the sort of typical Mary Sue story structure (the most important hero of the original story is foolishly infatuated with Mary Sue and uncharacteristically stupid) that actually makes the Greg flashbacks unenjoyable to me.

While Rose was really naive at best and kinda immature at worst, I don't think she's anywhere near being a ""complete moron"". That elequent/deep speech about how humans grow didn't come from a stupid mind. Plus, it's entirely possible that the gem's view towards Rose is the exaggeration and Greg's depiction is the one that's honest. Rose wasn't the perfectly wise and completely empathetic leader. She was naive, a little goofy, and even kind of [innocently incentive.] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive)

As for Garnet's characterization? While it's not as prominent as Pearl's or Amethyst's, I personally think she's had some nice subtle character growth.

215,"&gt;You tell him IMMEDIATELY after he see's Opal for the first time. You tell him BEFORE you start those fusion dance classes.

There's a problem with this. You can't drop something as big as 'Garnet is actually two people' on the audience just because Steven now knows about fusion. That would be like if the gems just told Steven everything about the Diamonds because he saw wall paintings of them in 'Serious Steven'. Something that big needs to be revealed big, hence why it was a season finale. The reasoning of 'waiting for his birthday or the right time/waiting until he's ready' is arguably not great, but it's acceptable. (At least in my eyes)

&gt;The thing that is eye rolling is that Garnet remained closeted for network reasons (to get the whole story out there before censors could panic and CN cancel.)

Didn't Rebecca say that Garnet being a fusion was planned from the start and that CN gives the crew a lot of freedom to do what they want?

&gt;ALSO her excuse for being a closet case -- as posted by you here -- was entirely projected onto her by fans and has in fact been 100% debunked by the show. So the subtext was misleading -- and now people are vaguely convinced that Garnet lived for a long time in shame on Homeworld because that would explain her habitual closeted nature -- when in fact she was first fused on Earth and immediately taken in by Rose and Pearl who were supportive.

You're right about ""she was first fused on Earth and immediately taken in by Rose and Pearl who were supportive"", but Garnet still got some pretty nasty shame from homeworld. A bunch of gems called her ""unbelievable!"", ""disgusting!"" and ""unheard of"". Blue Diamond was even gonna execute Ruby over what was a simple accident.

241,"&gt;The only thing he can feel good about having actually accomplished is having won Rose away from Pearl defeating Pearl in a romantic contest.

But Greg doesn't consider beating Pearl as a victory. After Pearl's song, he looks and feels genuinely bad about how defeated and lost Pearl sounds. ""I'm sorry you had to be around me."" 

&gt;Rose is dead. Greg gave up on Steven or Steven decided he was ready to ditch him to be a Gem. All Greg has won in his contest against Pearl is Pearl's defeat.

Rose dying doesn't erase ten years of a happy relationship. Greg winning Rose's heart is still an achievement. Greg and Steven haven't abandoned each other at all. Greg genuinely loves Steven and Steven still loves and respects Greg. 

&gt;This means that if Pearl does cheer up, move on and shack up with the powerful Lapis or whaoever -- Greg will have nothing left to claim as his victory.

At the end of the episode, Pearl and Greg are talking/laughing with each other on the ride back to Beach City. Pearl's moving on, and Greg is happy about that. Steven even sings a reprise of *it's over, isn't it* which indicates that their issues with each other are over.

&gt;The salt is actually all Greg's perspective.

Not exactly. If Pearl's song is any indication, then there was definitely a competition of sorts between her and Greg. (Like what we saw in *We Need To Talk*) ”I was fine, cause I knew, that they didn’t really matter until you. I was fine, when you came, and we fought like it was all some silly game, over her, who she’d choose. After all these years I never thought I’d lose.” Whether she was ""salty"" or not is debatable, but Pearl definitely had some level of jealousy towards Greg for actually winning over Rose.

You're right about Greg blaming her to a point. But honestly, she kind of DOES deserve a lot of the blame. Before the scene with Garnet and Pearl, Greg tries to get up to start cleaning but Amethyst stops him to watch more Little Butler. When he's upset that he's missing the fireworks and wants to be with Steven, Amethyst brushes it off saying that he'll be fine. She even sort of mocks him by saying he's ""sooooo sensitive"". I'm not saying Amethyst is a terrible person, she's got justifiable reasons, but she's not blameless in this situation either.

I'm not entirely sure what you mean with Greg not bothering to spend time with Steven.

267,"&gt;My main problems are that after all the mystery and intrigue as to what was in Lion's mane, Bismuth is just a Crystal Gem and nothing more.

Understandable, but Bismuth still has a lot of mystery. We still don't know WHY she was bubbled and put in Lion's main. Did Rose know something about her? Was she framed for something? Did she find one of Rose's secrets?

&gt;Plus... I really feel underwhelmed seeing how Lapis' poofer ended up being. I was expecting someone far more aggressive and vicious, maybe even dark-humored. Hell, I honestly thought she'd be downright evil and a sort of ""Token Evil Teammate"" to the Crystal Gems who was imprisoned by Rose for being far to sadistic towards Homeworld to the point of attacking civilians and brutalizing defeated Homeworld Gems. I expected a cool look at how being on the side of the rebellion didn't mean you were a good person, but instead we got a generic happy-go-lucky hero.

Fair point, but I don't think it's right to judge a character based on what you wanted her to be. When week of Sardonyx was announced, I really hoped that she would be a gem bounty hunter. But I knew it would be a long shot and knew I shouldn't be disappointed if it's not exactly what I want.

I tried to find the interview you talked about. While I didn't find it, I found [this one] (http://www.skwigly.co.uk/rebecca-sugar/) where Sugar does express a lot of respect for Tom. She even calls him her hero. So she probably isn't trying to embarrass him.

*Greg is my favourite, Steven’s dad, for a ton of reasons. I think he’s the most interesting character in the show and he’s voiced by my hero Tom Scharpling. I’m a huge fan of the Best Show and it really helped me when I was moving from New York to Los Angeles to do this work, his radio show really helped me to feel tied to my home. So this character is very special to me. It's so inspiring for me to work with Tom and to flesh him out as a character as he’s the bridge between the world of regular people and magical people and he’s so inspired by The Gems – he’s an artist. He’s very interesting, I really enjoy exploring him as a character. We see more of him as the show progresses.*

I never saw Pearl and Amethyst's relationship as a 'mother neglecting her child' thing. I saw it more like 'Two sisters bickering over how messy one's room is.'

While I admit that Garnet could've handled the situation in *secret team* better, I don't think it was THAT bad. Pearl and Amethyst were being paranoid over nothing and I'm sure Garnet had no intention in ACTUALLY harming them. Also, at what point was Steven seen to be enjoying Pearl and Amethyst being tossed around by what he thought were giant Gem hands/shards? I watched a clip to see what you mean, and I just saw him being terrified to tears.

I also saw a clip of *back to the barn* to try to find what you mean, and I didn't see Steven be thrilled or smile at the revelation. He seemed more shocked and confused. As for the contest, he probably just wanted to see giant robots do awesome stuff because he's a kid. I don't know how the contest was weighed against Pearl, her and Peridot seemed evenly matched when it came to intelligence.

For those who haven’t watched Transformers Prime, I’ll give you the basics on who Dreadwing is. Dreadwing is a decepticon who’s fiercely loyal to Megatron and values honor above everything else. His brother, Skyquake, was killed under Starscream’s command and was later raised from the dead. While Dreading is furious at this discovery, Megatron doesn’t punish Starscream for this.

Disillusioned with the Decepticon cause, Dreadwing stole a powerful weapon and delivered it to Optimus. His only request is that Optimus should ""put it to good use."" Optimus tried to recruit him to be an autobot, but Dreadwing responds with “Betraying my kind is not the same as joining yours.”

What if Jasper becomes like Dreadwing from Transformers Prime.

For those who haven’t watched Transformers Prime, I’ll give you the basics on who Dreadwing is. Dreadwing is a decepticon who’s fiercely loyal to Megatron and values honor above everything else. 

Later in the series, he becomes disillusioned with the Decepticon cause. Dreadwing later steals a powerful weapon and delivers it to Optimus, his only request that Optimus put it to good use. Optimus tries to recruit him to be an autobot, but Dreadwing responds with “Betraying my kind is not the same as joining yours.”

I feel like Jasper could go through a similar arc. She starts to question the ways of homeworld, sabotages their operations, but still refuses to join the crystal gems.

That whole dynamic is horrible and uncomfortable because of the open admiration of the idea that a dead mum is the best mum and that the best way to show you are serious about someone emotionally is to kill yourself 'for them.'

I... Never got that impression from the show. Steven wishes he knew more about her, and the crystal gems are obviously confused and lost without her guidance. How is the show saying 'dead mom is best mom' if the main characters are in distraught/depression over their loss?

As for killing yourself to show your caring for someone? While we don't know the exact reason she gave up her physical form, I don't think it was because of the reason your presenting. I personally think it was because she realized in 'We need to talk' that gems still somewhat looked down on humans and weren't equals, even though that was what the war was trying to correct.

Isn't that just on Sugilite, not Garnet? I thought fusions were their own people. Even if that wasn't the case, wouldn't that imply Amethyst abused Pearl too?

&gt;Garnet terrorizing and squeezing and throwing around a frightened Pearl,

&gt;Garnet summoning her gauntlets and smashing Pearl and Amethyst on the head, 

That was just sorta used for comedic effect. It was basically the Garnet version of a boy playfully slapping a friend in the back of the head when the friend does something dumb.

Fusion is obviously important to Garnet, it's the reason she's around, and Pearl was deceiving her just to get a quick fix of self-confidence and power. Not only that, but Pearl was also wasting time that could've been used to find Peridot. ""Peridot is still out there, and Pearl's been distracting us with **NOTHING!!!**"" Was what she did wrong?  Probably. But it's safe to say that Pearl and Garnet were BOTH in the wrong.

Honestly, I think Garnet's hostility makes her an even greater character. How boring would she be if she was just the one-dimensional stoic who occasionally talked about fusion? Every crystal Gem has gigantic moments of harshness. Pearl has training Connie to needlessly sacrifice herself and kidnapping Steven for space adventures,  Amethyst has shape-shifting into Steven's dead mother to taunt Greg, and Garnet has her brashness and high temper. These are all horrible acts, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're bullies or abusive or bad people.

506,"In my opinion, It's not really love at first sight. It's attraction at first sight. While love at first sight doesn't exist, attraction does. It isn't really 'I love this person and we're destined to be together!!!', It's more like 'that person is pretty and seems nice. I'm going to see if I can make this work.' Sometimes true love can bloom when two people find themselves attractive and see each other as all around good people. Sometimes things don't work out, other times it works out great! Does this happen a lot? No, but I've seen couples form from simple attraction. Heck, you could argue that's what happened with Greg and Rose. Greg gives up fame and fortune with his rock star dream because... he thought Rose was a hot tall babe. I feel like this was the case with Ruby and Sapphire.

As for the healing fountain? I think that's more an example of Rose's sympathy rather than her empathy. Empathy is when you put yourself in someone else's shoes, thinking about how your words/actions might personally effect someone. Sympathy is when you have compassion and feel sorry for people who are hurt. Garnet mentions how Rose felt deeply sorry for her hurt comrades. They don't call them healing TEARS for nothing.

Empire strikes back is another example. If the Empire could send ships to hoth and have them drop off a few walkers, why didn't they just send bombers to destroy the base faster? So we could have the awesome battle for Hoth.

**[A name and the forest:](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11017019/1/A-Name-and-The-Forest)** *Steven, through unspecified circumstances, wanders a forest with the company of the brutal but warm-hearted giant robot; his new friend puts on an act of being mean and scary, but Steven knows Sugilite. He knows all about big things that everyone thinks is scary, and he knows how to get through to them.* 

Basically just Steven and Grimlock from Transformers interacting off of eachother. Nothing much, but I really like the interactions they both have. I kinda want more crossover fics like this. Nothing big or grand, just random characters shooting the shit together.

585,"&gt;Male-presenting gems will give young boys someone to look up. The ones that can't see themselves in the female-presenting gems.

Sooooo boys can't like or look up to female characters? Why not? That doesn't make much sense. I'm a manly man and when I was younger, I LOVED the power puff girls and wanted be like them to help others. Heck, [here's an old tweet by Ian JQ at an old con where alot of little boys want drawings of Garnet.] (https://mobile.twitter.com/ianjq/status/619663748035248128) So I don't think gender matters when it comes to liking characters. If characters are awesome, they're awesome!

Also, I feel like it's too late to add male gems at this point. The show has pretty much established that gems are an all female race. Adding males now would just come off as a cheap way to attract a male audience.

EDIT: Didn't have time to address this, but now I do.

&gt;Steven is more of a decoy protagonist since the Gems always steal away the limelight.

Yeah... I can't disagree with with this harder then I am right now. While the gem's do get the spotlight here and there, the center of it is still Steven. For every 'Rose's Scabbard' and 'Jailbreak', there's a 'Full Disclosure' and 'Joy Ride' that focuses on Steven's problems and inner conflicts. Not to mention that he's the only character that's appeared in EVERY episode of the show. Even in flashback episodes, we see Steven before the flashback starts.

627,"&gt;If the story had Ruby and Sapphire running away from Home-World gems

I mean... That's kinda what actually happened. Blue Diamond wants to execute Ruby, Sapphire doesn't  want the person who saved her life to die, they run off. It's just not the focus of the story. While I do agree with you that conflict is important in most stories, it's not always 100% needed. Sometimes, we just need something more light-hearted for an episode. That's kinda what makes SU so great. It has conflict, but it sort of treats it as a background element instead of shoving it in your face. 

&gt;And on the subject of that, my point about the reaction videos is that everybody seemed so content with what I consider a lack-luster ending. Now what other people feel is none of my business. But what I want to illustrate with this video is how despite how many people love this episode, it has flaws and you have to recognize them! People praise this episode without considering it having massive problems and that's frustrating, especially when a lot of these people want to get into story-telling themselves!

Again, YOU see somethings as flaws, YOU thought the ending was lackluster and YOU thought it had massive problems. It's perfectly fine to think this, your thoughts are your own, but that doesn't mean it's not okay for others to not see flaws in it. It's okay for you to see flaws in something, just don't act like everyone NEEDS to see things the same way you do.",2016-03-15 09:44:05+00:00,d10fz44,3.0,t1_d10b7jo,16286,stevenuniverse
628,"Even Though I strongly disagree with a lot of this, you made a well put together review! Good on you! 

If you don't mind, I'd like to make a few points of my own

Firstly, the art change. While by definition it's definitely inconsistent, I don't really view it as a bad thing. The episode is still BEAUTIFUL with both styles mixed in. It's kinda like a bag of skittles. You don't always get the flavor you want, but they still taste sweet.

Secondly, the 'love at first site' thing. I'll admit, that is a VERY strong point you made. But I like to view it this way. It's not really love at first site, it's attraction at first site. While love at first site doesn't exist, attraction does. It isn't really 'I love this person and we're destined to be together!!!', It's more like 'that person is pretty and seems nice. I'm going to see if I can make this work.' Sometimes true love can bloom when two people find themselves attractive and see eachother as all around good people. Sometimes things don't work out, other times it works out great! Does this happen a lot? No, but I've seen couples form from simple attraction. Heck, you could argue that's what happened with Greg and Rose. Greg gives up fame and fortune with his rockstar dream because... he thought Rose was a hot tall babe. I feel like this was the case with Ruby and Sapphire. Even when they were fused, Garnet wasn't sure whether this was a good thing or a bad thing. It's foreign and different, but also strangely good. Something... Entirely new... Yeah. Another thing, I feel like Sapphire's attraction to Ruby comes from the fact she saved her life. That would warrant a little appreciation. And what's Ruby's reward from Blue Diamond for saving one of her aristocrats? Execution! Sapphire might've had other Rubies, be she Isn't heartless. 

Thirdly, and most importantly, just because you dislike something doesn't mean people who do like it are dumb. I know this wasn't your intention, but parts of the review, mostly when you kinda bash reaction people, comes off as that. People have different opinions and interpretations on things. Some people despise Lars and Ronaldo, others view them as funny and likable. It's perfectly awesome if you don't have the same opinion that the majority of people! Just don't act like it's because you know what's good in shows and what's not. There's no accounting for taste.",2016-03-15 01:48:57+00:00,d104fi6,1.0,t3_4afxc4,5842,stevenuniverse

648,"Video games, books, other TV shows, movies, comics. I'll give you a list of stuff I like. 

I've got a couple of comics I'd like to recommend to everyone. Comics I personally enjoy and hope others will enjoy.

**Penguin: Pain and Prejudice:** Known for being one of the more intelligent and sophisticated villain in Batman's rouges gallery, this comic dives into just how ruthless and black hearted this character can be. Dare I call it Penguin's 'The killing joke'?

**Deadpool kills the Marvel Universe:** Ever wonder what would happen if Deadpool went off the deep end (more than usual) and decided to kill every hero and villain in Marvel? This comic quenches that wonderment. It also has two sequal comics called Deadpool killustrated and Deadpool kills Deadpool I recommend.

**Joker by Brian Azzarello:** Remember that one episode of Batman TAS were a low level crook wants to become a big shot but gets in over his head when he teams up with Joker? Imagine the rated R version of that, and you got this comic.

**Transformers IDW collection:** Great reads for any Transformers fan, this comic series takes a darker look into the war between Autobots and Deceptions.

**The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl.** My more light hearted recommendation. A simple, funny comic series about an energenic Squirrel based heroine.


**The BioShock games:** Three games of pure artistic dystopian awesomeness. The first two deal with an underwater free market society and the third deals with a sky-high religious city. The gameplay's fun, the voice acting's great, the story's fantastic, and the twists are jaw dropping. 

**Spec Ops: the line:** Don't let the basic third-person, 'murican shooter look fool you, this game goes places. Places that are... Pretty dark. I won't go into details.

But how are four gems, three of which don't have the scientific minds and engineering skills, going to make giant advanced factories across the entire planet? Even with the 6,000 years of preperation, that's a pretty huge task for only four people. Rome wasn't built in a day, afterall. 

Plus, they would need proper tools, construction vehicles, etcetera to build all this. And, like you said, they're in the bronze age. Does Pearl have a ready supply of tools and construction vehicles in her back pocket? The fact that Pearl needed to use Greg's tools to build a spaceship begs to differ.

I'd imagine humans would still be protective over their recources. The idea that four strange women taking the stuff you use to make tools for hunting and such to make giant structures over their land wouldn't really sit well with pritave humans. Some would want to fight back, and human loving Rose wouldn't exactly be thrilled over the idea of killing humans to make factories and armies. That's the reason she started the rebellion in the first place. It would make the crystal gems hypocrites if they used up a bunch of earths recources to make armies and factories when their enemy was going to do the same thing but faster.

768,"&gt;there is a point in the show where we are explicitly meant to recognize that Connie is behaving very differently than Greg did as her reaction to the Gems.

Is there? I personally think it's all up for interpretation.

&gt;Connie has recognized what the Gems are and responded as a human with respect and a desire to actually HELP defend Earth.

Who says Greg needs to help the gems fight homeworld 24/7? He's aloud to have the choice to stay on the side lines and let the gems do there thing. Plus, how exactly would Greg help defend earth? Not to disrespect him, I love his character, but he's just a chubby forty year old man with a van, a car wash, and musical talents. Not exactly someone I see going up against a homeworld quartz soldier.

&gt;Greg is very subtly but also very very very consistently shown as disliking the whole 'protectors of Earth' aspect of Rose's nature. (And his ambivalence about Steven is very clearly linked to Steven occasionally scaring and confusing him due to having alien traits.) He is contemptuous or jokingly dismissive of 'Gem-stuff' on the surface and then frightened when he is pressured to confront it. Greg find it threatening to his masculinity and superiority over the others in a way that has made him a HUGE liability to the whole plan to protect Earth.

I wouldn't say he dislikes the crystal gems for protecting earth. I feel like he respects them, but is more terrified of the danger itself. How would you react if you found out your friends constantly fought giant monsters that could kill you in seconds? He's not worried about his masculinity, he's worried about being blown up or eaten.

&gt;Flashback Greg is the most egregious example of one EVER.

He is? I'm not an expert on Mary Sues or writing characters, but Flashback Greg dosen't seem 100% perfect or respected by everyone. No one came to his concert, Marty looks down on him, Pearl sees him as a 'phase', and Rose laughs in his face when he tries to fuse with her.",2016-02-24 22:19:59+00:00,d0cij7e,10.0,t1_d0c6nsw,15548,stevenuniverse

Mostly because flashback episodes in general don't really do this kind of thing. Short, exaggerated flashbacks are played for laughs. But when the majority of the episode is a flashback, it's usually accurate to what actually happened.

Also, I don't see a reason for Greg to lie just to make himself look better. He's already got Steven's and Connie's respect and admiration. It's like running laps in the Olympics when you already won the gold.

Again, these are interesting and well put together points. I'm just throwing in my two cents.

810,"Good points.

But here's the thing about Greg's lie. He didn't know his lie would affect Steven's confidence in such a bad way. He barely knows anything about how magic works, even less than Steven. And he does feel genuinely bad and regretful when he finds out he unintentionally damaged his healing powers, to a point where he tries to fix the Geode himself.

Again, you're right about Pearl not being great with lies. But I feel like she could become skilled at alot of things if she sees it as important. Watching Steven sleep probably wasn't on top of her priority list, so it makes sense that she would fumble with creating a good excuse as to why dhe watches him in his sleep. But gaining a HUGE confidence and power boost through fusion when she was severely needing both? That's very important to her, so she would put mor effort into her deception skills. Plus, like i said before, there have been a few times where she lied with success. Think back to 'Cheeseburger backpack' with the knowledge that it was all a test. Was there ever a point where Pearl made it sound like it was all a test for Steven. She made it sound like the lunar sea spire was grand and extremely important to gem culture, but brushes it off in 'The test'.

Let's put ourselves in Greg's shoes for a minute. We've got a man who had to raise a child with no house, a dead wife, and the income of a carwash. It's definitely not easy, but he manages to raise Steven well and give him a happy childhood. Eight long years of raising him later, he decides to give him a more comfortable home with the gems. How often does he see his son now? Once, maybe twice every two weeks or so?  That may not sound like much, but when you spent nearly every day of eight years taking care of your son, you're gonna feel distant and somewhat lonely. That's not mentioning the fact that Greg knows Steven's fighting deadly monsters constantly, which would just add more stress and desire to be with him. Personally, I think Greg wants to spend AS MUCH time with Steven. Was lying the best way to do it? Of course not. But, to me at least, it's not unbelivable for his character.

You're definitely right on Pearl not being a great liar. But there have been times where she managed to keep secrets and lie very well. She managed to keep the sea spire test a secret for a long time, and succesfully lied to Steven about giving him a 'real' test soon after he learned the truth about the spire. Plus, Pearl told us that Rose trusted her with some of her secrets, like the location of the armory.

Also, let's put ourselves in Rose's shoes and see her options of who to make leader once she's gone.

Amethyst: Reckless, inexperienced, and impulsive. Has some self-hatred because of her origins from the kindergarten and thinks she's inferior when comparing herself to Garnet and Pearl.

Pearl: Perfectionist, has low self-esteem and low self-confidence, and is emotionally unstable. Gets easily flustered and overwhelmed when facing the unknown or when her plans fail.

Garnet: Can be brash at times, but is mostly cool headed and kind hearted. Has future vision and is the most composed when extreme situations arise.

There's also a few comics I'd like to recommend.

**Penguin: Pain and Prejudice:** Known for being one of the more intelligent and sophisticated villain in Batman's rouges gallery, this comic dives into just how ruthless and black hearted this character can be. Dare I call it Penguin's 'The killing joke'?

**Deadpool kills the Marvel Universe:** Ever wonder what would happen if Deadpool went off the deep end (more than usual) and decided to kill every hero and villain in Marvel? This comic quenches that wonderment. It also has two sequal comics called Deadpool killustrated and Deadpool kills Deadpool I recommend.

**Joker by Brian Azzarello:** Remember that one episode of Batman TAS were a low level crook wants to become a big shot but gets in over his head when he teams up with Joker? Imagine the rated R version of that, and you got this comic.

**Transformers IDW collection:** Great reads for any Transformers fan, this comic series takes a darker look into the war between Autobots and Deceptions.

**The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl.** My more light hearted recommendation. A simple, funny comic series about an energenic Squirrel based heroine.

Developing her as a lesser version of Pearl rather than a reflection of Steven was a demotion.

I'm not sure what you mean. How are Pearl's problems similar to Amethyst's problems? Pearl's dealing with the loss of Rose and lack of confidence. Amethyst's dealing with the kindergarten's dark legacy and her part in it. How are those two similar in any way, shape, or form?

We've seen how when Garnet gets conflicted, Ruby and Sapphire start to surface. (Keeping it together) But the only times we seen her do this is when her emotions are in turmoil. Whether that be seeing fusion monsters for the first time or finding out Pearl was tricking her for personal pleasure. 

In conclusion: Garnet does have her own feelings. When those feelings are compromised, she unfuses. Fusion requires emotional stability. Ruby and Sapphire unfused because **Garnet** was emotionally hurt and conflicted.

The whole Pearl thing I can kinda get, although I still like the fan art because I like dark stuff. But I gotta disagree with you on Greg. He clearly loves his son, and would never harm him purposefully, he just fumbles with raising him. And that's completely normal for a parent. Raising a child is extremely difficult, and there isn't an official right way to do it. Parents can't always please their children, that's just life. Greg's doing what he thinks is best for Steven.

Because I honestly don't see that anywhere. The reason Pearl had a hard time communicating inside the box was because she felt unimaginably guilty about what she did.

&gt; Garnet doesn't really deserve to be liked and respected at this point.

Seriously??? I'm not trying to stomp on opinions here but... Really? The only time Garnet has shown the smallest bit of these traits was in the Sardonyx arc. And even then, it was understandable and justified. Fusion is very important and serious to her. Pearl wasn't going to trick Garnet without receiving serious consequences. Plus, she did eventually forgive Pearl in the end. Did Garnet handle this whole thing properly? That's debatable. But I think her showing these negative traits makes her that much greater. 

We haven't seen many of Garnet's flaws before the Sardonyx arc. She was still a great character, but she lacked anything interesting. (If we're not counting her being a fusion) Now that she's showing that she isn't as loving or caring as we thought, that makes her more three dimensional and, for lack of a better term, human.

I personally think it's because the show's completely from Steven's point of view. We don't learn something until Steven learns something. And, in my opinion, I wouldn't have it any other way. In nearly every cartoon, it will show the audience something that the main characters don't see. (Example: the bad guy's hand slowly emerging from the rubble after his/her defeat.) This isn't bad, and it definitely works. But what makes SU so great is that ANY episode could have a big reveal, so it's completely unpredictable. The official summary for 'On the run' is just ""Steven and Amethyst runaway and try life on the road."" No one had any idea we were going to find out that Amethyst actually came from earth. And even when we don't see more backstory in an episode, we still have great characters, neat little side-stories, nice music/songs, good jokes, and a bunch of other cool things to keep us preoccupied.",2015-09-21 09:39:28+00:00,cv8uwyq,1.0,t3_3lrz6k,8965,stevenuniverse

I feel like your focusing on Sadie when the source of the problem was her mother. Barbara (Sadie's mom) has similarities with Dr Maheswaran, them being mothers who have a bit too much control over their daughters. But where Dr Maheswaran is overprotective, Barbara is oversupportive. She took even the smallest hobby Sadie had the slightest interest in and turned it into the greatest thing her daughters going to do. 

So why didn't Sadie just say no? It's hard to say with what little evidence we have, but I think it's a similar reason why Connie just accepted all the health rules and such from her parents. Even when we're teenagers/young adults, we can have a hard time talking down to our parents. Not everyone is like this, but it could be the case with Sadie.

That's because he's also very hilarious and charismatic. The first time we meet him, he talks about his pet horse made of diamonds and complains about eating bad pretzels. Not only that, but he also has quite moments. When you kill his girlfriend, he's genuinely stunned, at a lost for words. And the cherry on top is his motivation. Throughout the game, Jack's goal is to bring peace to Pandora and proclaims that he's the real hero of the story. While what he does is evil, his motivation is purely good.

Pearl is similar in some ways. While she does do some awful actions, that doesn't mean she's a bad person. She does genuinely care about Steven and the other gems and is willing to protect earth to her dying day.

The point I want to make is this. When we see a character that provokes a strong emotion, like anger, we get invested in a way. With Jack, we want to see him pay for his actions because he's the villain. With Pearl, we want to see her improve and move on from her past because she's a hero.
