Outside of Lars, Mystery Girl, and maybe both Buck and Mayor Dewey, all the humans have been fleshed out.

So I think that after 'Three gems and a baby', we'll focus more on the Gem plotlines. Jasper, curing corruption (and healed Centipeetle by proxy), maybe some more stuff with Mystery Girl and Bismuth (on a side note, Is Bismuth's voice actor actually really expensive? I understand famous Broadway and music stars, but are regular actors just as experience?),  etcetera. 

Then, the Diamonds come in full force. Whether they destroy just the town/temple, actually conquer the planet, or something in between, the crystal gems now needs to ally with the humans and work with them more closely.

1.) Watching the Secretariat movie that Bojack dreamed of doing slowly fall apart and Bojack being so desperate to be happy is pretty gut wrenching... In a good way.

2.) Mr Peanutbutter has officially won me over. The moment where he doesn't take Bojack's shit in the gameshow episode really elevated him for me. He and Diane do share genuine chemistry and the moment when he forgives her in the last episode is just golden.

3.) Bojack's mom is the worst. Give Rutabaga credit, while he doesn't commit to divorcing his wife he at least had some charisma and seems to have a little genuine care for Carolyn if his movie star speech was any indication. Bojack's mom is just utterly cold, abusive, and cruel. The scene where she forces young Bojack to smoke was actually kinda hard to watch. Please tell me she gets turned into glue by the end of season 3. (Don't actually spoil anything)

4.) I was fine with Bojack keeping Todd around just because he was lonely, but when he said that letting Todd stay was the nicest thing he's ever done is probably the most heartwarming moment in the series so far for me.

5.) Wanda's really cute and the joke where she proposes a comedy at the *twin towers* is perfection. If Bojack wasn't so... Bojack, they'd make a cute couple.

6.) [""You look just like your mother.""] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OXQpQ7OZw0U)

7.) I cannot believe that running monkey actually had significance and that they're STILL doing the hollywoo gag.

One example is Rose and Navey, both having belly button gemstones and bubbly/joyful personalities.

So can we use this to guess White Diamond's personality since her, Pearl, and Peridot have forehead gems? We should start with what traits Pearl and Peridot have in common. I'm typing this at school, so the most I can say is that their both are incredibly intelligent. 

Personally, I'm hoping for an emotionless megalomaniacle perfectionist who's willing to do anything to achieve order in a random universe. (or what she considers as order) But also someone who's [faux affably evil] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil) with superficial charm and charisma so she can convince others that he's right.

Personally, I think that they're necessary for a couple of reasons. 

**1.) They show us the human side of SU.**

While the magic gem stuff is really amazing, it's important to see the human side of things as well. Steven doesn't want to save earth just because thats's what crystal gems do, he does it because he enjoys being around his human friends. The evacuation in 'The Return' wouldn't be as impactful if we hardly knew who these humans are. Plus, Steven is half gem AND half human. So it only makes sense that the show would flip-flop between gem adventures and mundane human activities.

**2.) They give us needed breaks from the dramatic moments of the show.**

Don't get me wrong, the dramatic and serious moments of SU are some of the best aspects of the show. But if was ALWAYS dramatic and serious, it would loose it's charm. It's the reason people stop watching Bojack Horseman, NOT because it's bad but because it's too depressing. Sometimes we need a break From all the crying and singing so we can just watch the characters we love be the characters we love. 

**3.) They teach very good/unique lessons and morals.**

The gay representation is extremely powerful, but the other morals it teaches in filler episodes are pretty great as well. 'Future Boy Zoltron' shows that you can't FORCE depressed people to be happy, just make them feel comfortable around you. 'Onion Gang' shows that people with weird hobbies and unusual personalities still experience the same human emotions as normal people. Onion is FAR from being an everyday kid, but he still feels isolated like Steven.

There are other reasons why I think filler episodes are necessary, but these are the main three. What do you guys think?",stevenuniverse,Why I personally think that filler episodes are necessary,https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/53c0lx/why_i_personally_think_that_filler_episodes_are/

Most people chalk this up to her either Pink being squeamish and not wanting to conquer, or that she was recently created.

Personally, I think it's because she was incompetent. She was ultimately lacking actual conquering skills and lost planets as soon as she tried to harvest them. This lead to being the weakest/least respected Diamond of the four.

Until she stumples upon a primitive planet that offers little to no resistance from the local inhabitants and rich resources that produces stupidly strong quartz gems. This is Pink Diamond's one chance to win the respect of the other Diamonds. Her one chance to brecome a genuine conquerer with a powerful army backing her up. And there's no way that a quartz gem will see beauty In earth, hate what homeworld is doing to it, and start a rebellion.

From what I've seen on a commercial or two, it's about a washed up actor who's a jerk horse guy? I thought it looked simple, but apparently it's a lot deeper and emotional from what people tell me. So I've got a few questions about the show.

1.) What's the show mainly about?

2.) Who are the characters and what are they like?

3.) Is the voice acting good? (Weird question, but it's one of the things I greatly respect in most shows. It may be involved with my desire to be a voice actor when I grow up.)

I've been thinking about this a lot recently. Obviously, a character having flaws makes them more human and relatable. And Steven Universe is overflowing with those characters. But then there's Connie and Garnet, who have little to no flaws at all.

Granted, they have a few flaws. Connie's socially awkward and Garnet's not comfortable with her position as leader. But they aren't exactly explored as much as say Amethyst's self loathing or Pearl's mourning over Rose. This, of course, lead to people complaining that their boring/flat characters.

While they all have fair points, are flaws really necessary for a character to be enjoyable? I enjoy flaws as much as the next guy, but I also enjoy a character's personality, mannerisms, designs, etcetera. 

I don't like Amethyst just because her self loathing issues are relatable, I like her because she's fun-loving and carefree. I don't like Pearl just because of her issues with Rose, I like her because she's an overprotective mama bird who's genuinely sweet.

The same can be said about Connie and Garnet. Connie's kind, nerdy, and talented. Garnet's loving, gives great advice, and funny.

What do you guys think?

Why would Rose refuse to use a weapon that could possibly kill the Diamonds while there was a WAR going on. While her morals most likely played a part in it, there's something else we should consider.

Rose didn't want to free/conquer homeworld, she just wanted to save earth.

In *The Answer*, Rose doesn't say something along the lines of  ""You'll pay for your crimes, Blue Diamond!"" She says, and I quote, ""Blue Diamond, leave this planet! This colony will not be completed!"" When Greg asks if she misses her homeworld, she replies with a quick no without any hesitation.

From what we've learned from Greg's backstory episodes, she's sweet as sugar, graceful, and somewhat [innocently insensitive] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive)/nieve towards human things like how relationships and babies work.

But something important to remember is that this is Rose AFTER she won the war. We have yet to see her during the war or directly interact with homeworld gems. And I doubt she'd be as sweet and childlike towards her enemies.

So here's my take on what's gonna happen this week. (Note that I haven't seen so much as a screenshot of next week's episodes, so I could be super wrong) 

Crack the Whip: Steven and Amethyst, looking for Jasper, stumble upon an old crystal Gem base. They find old video recording/written logs or something along those lines that reveals Rose did morally questionable stuff during the war. (Torturing homeworld gems for information, using human soldiers as cannon fodder when she started running out of Gem soldiers, pick your poison ladies and gents)

Steven vs Amethyst: This isn't gonna be a straight up fight, (although it could escalate to that) it's about how they're handling the new revelation about Rose. Steven feels confused but is still forgiving, Amethyst feels angry and betrayed because the others didn't tell her, and they go back and forth on what they think.

It was funny, heartfelt, the singing from everyone's great, Steven being his genuinely sweet and helpful self by getting Pearl and Greg to talk about their problems involving the love triangle they had with Rose, it had everything I could ask for in an SU episode.

And as I go through different posts about the episode, I'm surprised by all the contrasting opinions. 

*Before I go any further, I would like to clarify that I don't mind people having different opinions. As I always say, there's no accounting for taste.* 

Here's two examples: Some enjoyed Greg's singing while others say that it bad to the point of cringe. Some don't mind the *spending spree* trope, others detest it. 

Of course, this isn't the first time people have had contrasting opinions on certain episodes. But this particular case made me wonder if I had any opinions that contrasted with the majority. I like Ronaldo and Lars, but it's somewhat understandable why they're hated. The ships I don't go nuts over I'm indifferent to. 

Then it hit me. And it's not as simple as 'I hate character x and episode y', it's about the show as a whole.

Where most people give praise/focus to the deeper meanings and subtext, I mainly focus on the simplistics. 

The great voice acting, the backgrounds, how the crew tells so much with so little, the morals it teaches, the clever writing, the small things like that. Now all these things have been praised, but it's the way it all comes together is what makes it extra special for me. Everything just blends so perfectly with each other. The voices fit the characters and their designs, the backgrounds fit the feeling of each environment, the music fits the mood of each scene, etcetera.  

Another thing I greatly appreciate is that it's not afraid to still be a kids cartoon. It has controversial messages, dark moments, and deep emotions, but still does fun cartoon-y stuff. Steven has become a bottomless well of empathy and kindness, but he's still a goofball who's overdramatic about not getting fresh donuts. *Mr Greg* has a meaningful/emotional conversation between Greg and Pearl, but it also has goofy moments like [this.] (http://67.media.tumblr.com/562f9ed91b1fa8fff49c19f528913556/tumblr_inline_o9zdpj6MTI1s18x0o_500.png)

It's only dramatic and serious when it NEEDS to be dramatic and serious. If it was always dramatic, it would loose it's charm and fun. The fact that it gets serious sparingly means that those scenes just hit harder.

I also usually accept what's given to me and focus on what it's saying. This means that I'm more forgiving of some of the head scratchers of the show. For example, *Nightmare Hospital*. Yeah, it's kinda weird how Dr Maheswaran thinks the fusion monsters are humans. But that's not the focus of the episode. The focus is on Dr Maheswaran realizing that she's too protective and doesn't actually know a lot about her daughter. Coming back to *Mr Greg*, I'll admit that I'm not a huge fan of the *spending spree* trooe. But again, that's not what the episode is about. It's about Pearl and Greg's uneasy relationship involving Rose.


Welp, those are the things I admire about SU. I hope you all enjoy the rest of Summer for Steven!

(So I've decided to do movie reviews. Here's how they're gonna go down. One or two movies for one post and mostly my general thoughts on them. Sometimes I'll talk about other stuff, like what makes a good story and comparing the two movies when I have two to talk about. Let's get right to it.)

To me, the most important thing in any piece of fiction is the characters. You can have the best backgrounds and story, but it won't mean anything if you have badly written characters. I bring this up because the movies I'm reviewing today are somewhat similar, but differ when it comes to character quality.

*9, by Timur Bekmambetov and Tim Burton*

9 is about, who else, the main character 9 waking up to a hostile and unfamiliar environment. He meets up with other numbered survivers, and the rest of the film is mostly about metal monsters and finding out what caused the world around them to crumble. The movie's biggest flaw is the characters. It's not that they're bad, it's just that they're pretty bland. 9 is the basic wide-eyed and curious hero, 1 is the old leader who believes sacrificing others for many is the right thing, 8 is the big muscle with little intelligence, etcetera. But I will say this, they all have creative designs and good voice acting to make up for it. Overall, the movie's mostly solid. The monsters are pretty cool, the action's intense, the post apocalyptic world is nice, and the story's simple but effective. Not spectacular, but still pretty good. 

*10 Cloverfield Lane, by J. J. Abrams*

This movie is about a young woman named Michelle, like 9, waking up in a hostile and unfamiliar environment. (A bunker) The person who brought her there, a large man named Howard, tells her that the world is ending. The main problem is that Howard's showing signs of lunacy. The movie is mostly about Michelle and another surviver named Emmett trying to decide if they should leave the bunker or not. Michelle and Emmett are great characters, but it's Howard that steals the show. He's so intimidating and big, but is also ambiguous. A great deal of the film's tension comes the mystery surrounding Howard's nature and intentions. Through out the movie you're not sure if he's a Well-Intentioned Extremist, a budding Serial Killer, a deluded survivalist, or a depressing loner? The whole movie is delightfully suspenseful and tense, and is a satisfying sequel (?) to one of my favorite monster movies. I highly recommend it.

Ruff 'n tuff space marines fighting alien bugs seemed like some simple fun. So I looked it up to see if it was good or not. Common things came up like ""misunderstood"" and ""ahead of its time"".

I bought the DVD online and watched it. It's pretty darn great if I do say so myself. But how exactly is it ahead of its time? I get that it's poking fun at militarism, and that the way overconfident soldiers are torn apart by a group of beings with near suicidal devotion to their colony mirrors events in our world, but what's the full extent to it? Something I did notice is that gender/race issues are practically non-existent. To a point where male and female soldiers are bathing in the same shower stall. I'm not an expert in army stuff, so maybe this is more common than I think, but that seems like something that wouldn't be allowed. I guess this militaristic future where countless young soldiers are slaughed for a mindless retaliation towards killer insects has it's perks?

For me personally, I'm hoping for a stoic, monotone, leader-type who takes her job as crystal gem very seriously. (Imagine season one Garnet multiplied by ten.) Story wise, I feel like she might've been a big name crystal gem during the Gem war. But unlike Pearl and Garnet, she didn't exactly see eye to eye with some of Rose's decisions. To a point where she proclaims that she should be leader.
And while she does genuinely care about earth and it's inhabitants, deep down she just wants to get recognition and praise for being a skilled leader.

Another idea I had for her is that she claims she's better than the other crystal gems, but actually has all of their flaws. (Garnet's 'violence is the answer' mentality, Pearl's perfectionism and complicated strategies, Amethyst's brutal honesty, Lapis's cynicism, Peridot's egotism and condescending nature.)

TL;DR: I'm hoping for a combination of [Locus from Red vs Blue] (http://img.ifcdn.com/images/c0bfe9830482d42f231aeae9d8c1bbd167189e25eb4962b84d468371a0349b5f_3.jpg) and [Starscream from Transformers.] (http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/a/af/Starscream_prime-0.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150430080532)

This probably won't happen, seeing as Peridot is her own Starscream in a weird way. ""WAIT, I'm the one who betrayed the mission, who called Yellow Diamond a clod, **the new leader of the Crystal Gems?**

(Like Yellow Diamond coming to earth.) Should Steven stop using his words to solve conflicts when the ruthless gem empire comes a-knocking?

Some people say that Steven resorting to violence would clash too much with his character and the shows message overall. You don't need violence to solve problems and that there's no such thing as a good war. Others say that Steven can't possibly talk down all the antagonists, which are cold-hearted planet killers, without the show becoming repetitive. Both sides have fair points and counterpoints.

Personally, I'm actually kinda hoping for a mixture of the two. Steven being forced to use violence to kill one or two of the Diamonds, (There's gotta be three from the hint of White Diamond in 'it could've been great') which results in either two things.

1.) He feels extreme guilt about taking a life.

2.) It completely backfires and results in something worse happening. (Beach City destroyed, earth's now under homeworld's boot heal, White Diamond causing rave induced genocides across the whole universe, etcetera.)

What do you guys think? Should Steven learn that sweet kindness and understanding isn't gonna solve all your problems, or should his considerate pacifist nature stay with him to the end?

So why bomb the earth with corruption if the earth's gonna be destroyed anyway? One that note, why bother making the cluster in the first place if you have a huge corruption bomb lying around?

There are a number of reasonable explanations here: It takes concentration which Garnet didn't have because of the ground cracking up, (see also Amethyst not being able to shape shift in 'Secret team') Garnet being hesitant on taking the homeworld Gem that unfused her and head-butted Steven, she only had five seconds to react, ~~Two redemption/character arcs going at the same time would be complicated and bubbling Jasper to bring her back later would be too similar to Peridot's arc, so the writers just let her fall,~~ the list goes on.

But this brings up a certain question. Has Garnet become too overpowered? With her huge strength and list of top notch abilities, she's practically leagues ahead of Pearl and Amethyst. Future vision itself seems to be a gigantic power that could make Garnet unstoppable.

While I can't say much for her other abilities, there is one major flaw in future vision. Garnet can only **predict** certain events. It only shows her possible futures, and the one she chooses isn't automatically set in stone. This is evident in 'The answer' where Sapphire didn't expect Ruby to fuse with her, and even in it's debute where Garnet thinks telling Steven his possible deaths will bring them closer when it just turns him into a paranoid mess.

The reception is... Well... Surprisingly mixed if you can believe it. Some are saying it's amazing and emotional, while others are saying it was rushed and anticlimactic. I've even seen one or two people, and I won't name names, that are saying that they had straight up lazy writing and that the crew dropped the ball hard.

**Before I go on, I would just like to say that there's no right or wrong opinion and that you're free to think what you want about the episodes. As I always say, there's no accounting for taste.**

Personally, not only do I love this two parter, I think it gives 'Mirror Gem/Ocean Gem' and 'The Return/Jailbreak' a run for their money. Yep, I'm saying this is my new favorite two parter as of right now!

Let's start with Watermelon Island. It's got a giant fusion fight and adorable Watermelon people. Very simplistic, but beyond well executed. Alexandrite vs Malachite has got to be my favorite fight in the show so far. Don't get me wrong, the fights in the other two parter specials are awesome in their own right. But nothing compares to the Pacific Rim styled kaiju fusion smackdown that happened here. I now await for someone to make a big of someone on the show saying ""We are cancelling the apocalypse!!!"" As for Jasper slipping off into that crack with the gems trying to get her? I mean, it's not really THAT big a problem with the episode is it? Plus, alot of chaos was happening and they probably didn't have time to react. It's kinda like why Amethyst couldn't shape shift in 'Secret Team', she was freaking out.

Next comes Gem Drill, which really what elevates this to my favorite two parter. Steven talking to the cluster has got to be one of my favorite scenes in the entire show. Some call it rushed, lazy writing, or a Deus ex machina. I call it the perfect illustration of why Steven is an amazing character. The fact that he didn't want it destroyed, tried and succeeded in making all the countless gems (Gem souls? Fragments of souls?) happy, and that he was horrified to the point of hyperventilating at the idea of countless gems dying despite the fact that the cluster was gonna destroy everyone he's loved along with the rest of humanity?!? I mean..... Just..... **I LOVE THIS CHARACTER SO MUCH!!! I WISH I WAS THIS SWEET AND CONSIDERATE!!!**

Anyway, that's my review/opinion on these two episodes. The perfect example of why I believe in Steven...

On an unrelated note, I'm probably the only one on this subreddit who first thought of [this] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dwq524mLKiU) when I saw the Watermelon Stevens attack Malachite.

Those four statues, one of them destroyed, started the 'Rose is Pink Diamond' theory. (At least by my knowledge) After Diamond's were revealed and looking nothing like the statues, the theory more or less died. 

So are these just random statues? Why all the trouble of hiding Pink Diamond? Earlier today, I had an interesting thought.

What if the statue gems, along with Rose, were the Diamond's lieutenants? Gems that do all the heavy lifting while the Diamond's just give orders.

Pearl: I could fix your car!

Vidalia: My car's not broke.

Garnet: I could break your car.

Vidalia: WHY WOULD I WANT THAT!?!

You could have the most clever, nuanced, well-written stories in history and it would fall flat on it's face if it has boring characters we don't want to see succeed. And SU definitely succeeds with great characters. They're fun, interesting, and... Well, not exactly mentally stable.

It's easy to say that the crystal gems have PTSD, and they do have several symptoms of that. But why don't we get creative with this. Let's really psychoanalyze the gem's. (Along with other characters.)

I'll start things off with Pearl.

Again, it's easy to say that she has PTSD. But looking up disorders, I think she's more likely to have a borderline personality disorder. For someone to have borderline personality disorder, he/she must have five of nine traits. Let's dive in.

&gt;Extreme reactions—including panic, depression, rage, or frantic actions—to abandonment, whether real or perceived.

Pearl has definitely shown extreme reactions when it comes to Rose. She practically yells at Steven when she realizes that Rose might've kept secrets from her sole confidant.

 &gt;A pattern of intense and stormy relationships with family, friends, and loved ones, often veering from extreme closeness and love (idealization) to extreme dislike or anger. (devaluation) 

Idealization: Rose Quartz.
Devaluation: Greg Universe. (At least in the flashbacks.)

&gt;Distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self, which can result in sudden changes in feelings, opinions, values, or plans and goals for the future (such as school or career choices) 

Pearl's lack of self-esteem and confidence definitely attributes to this. She practically forgets about finding Peridot so she could feel brief confidence as Sardonyx.

&gt;Impulsive and often dangerous behaviors, such as spending sprees, unsafe sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, and binge eating.

Trying to take Steven into space in a barely functional ship, with parts she stole from Greg's van. See also the Sardonyx incident, where she lied to Garnet for a quick fix of strength and self-confidence.

&gt;Recurring suicidal behaviors or threats or self-harming behavior, such as cutting.

Needlessly sacrificing yourself constantly in battle (Sworn to the sword) can attribute to this.

&gt;Intense and highly changeable moods, with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days. 

Maybe? Not 100% sure on this one.

&gt;Chronic feelings of emptiness and/or boredom.

Eh, not really.

&gt;Inappropriate, intense anger or problems controlling anger.

Eh, this is more Garnet/Ruby than Pearl.

&gt;Having stress-related paranoid thoughts or severe dissociative symptoms, such as feeling cut off from oneself, observing oneself from outside the body, or losing touch with reality.

Maybe? She doesn't grasp the fact that the ship in 'Space Race' is falling apart until Steven snaps her out of it. 

Counting them up, looks like Pearl has 5 to 6 out of 9 symptoms of borderline personality disorder.

There's a nitpick among some fans that asks one question. Why didn't Rose help Pearl with her self-confifdence and help Amethyst get rid of her self-loathing? They've been together for thousands of years after the war was, yet they still held onto these negative feelings that Rose apparently ignored.

Most usually shrug this off, but it promted me to think up a reason. Then I realized something. 

It wasn't because Rose didn't try to help them, it was because she was probably bad at helping people. 

Rose is a quartz gem. Gems that are made to be big strong warriors. For whatever reason, she grew a concious and decided to rebel against homeworld, which is good. She eventually became an all loving person and protector of the human race.

But here's the thing. Rose, as far as we know, wasn't a grand master or leader when she was first created. She was just a warrior. She had love for everything and a good moral code, but little to no sage advice or wisdom to give. Rose didn't ignore the other crystal gems, she just gave them simple compliments and genuine, but basic appretiation that would only give them short lasting satisfaction. 

What do you guys think? Anything I missed?

1.) Lapis and Jasper joined the crystal gems. The crystal gems and the three homeworld gems are fighting the Diamond's new elite squad of gems. The new elite squad look and talk like something out of a cheesy Sci Fi movie from the 50's. There's also a 50's robot with them. The crystal gems get their butts handed to them and they're forced to all fuse together to defeat them. Imagine a horrific being that's looks like Alexandrite mixed with a spider with legs, legs, and random colors mishmashed together. I don't remember the rest of the dream, but it ends with Amethyst looking proud and holding a large frog.

2.) Steven and Charlie from We bare bears are hanging out. Charlie's sad because he's not accepted by society and Steven cheers him up. You know, cause that's how Steven do.

3.) Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl are kidnapped. Steven and Connie are the only ones that can help them. Out of nowhere, Deadpool shows up and says he'll help. He says something like ""I'll help you, but you gotta look the part if you wanna hang out with me!"" And he gets them Deadpool style suits, Steven's is Pink and Connie's is blue. The rest of the dream us just the three of them fighting bad guys while Steven and Connie are horrified by Deapools... methods. Imagine the montage in the new Deadpool movie but with Steven and Connie thrown in there.

&gt;If I could begin to be,
Half of what you think of me,
I could do about anything,
I could even learn how to love.
When I see the way you act,
Wondering when I'm coming back,
I could do about anything,
I could even learn how to love like you.
I always thought, I might be bad,
Now I'm sure that it's true,
'Cause I think you're so good,
And I'm nothing like you.
Look at you go!
I just adore you!
I wish that I knew What makes you think I'm so special...
If I could begin to do something that does right by you,
I would do about anything,
I would even learn how to love...
When I see the way you look,
Shaken by how long it took,
I could do about anything,
I could even learn how to love like you!
Love me like you...

I'll give the basics about Prowl for those who don't read the comics. Prowl is the strategist of the Autobots, the man with the plan. But he feels like too many   loose cannons in the ranks. Hot headed, savage brutes like Grimlock. Loud mouthed daredevils like Hot Rod. He even says Optimus can be restless at times.

""The average Autobot default setting is daredevil maverick. That's not us, Perceptor. We can subdivide this war into its purest mathematical form and generate solutions all we want, but unless we happen to be surfing on a meteoroid at the time, no one will pay attention."" —Prowl

He goes so far as to say the Deceptions act more as one than Autobots.

""They may have sinister goals, but there's nothing evil about reason, analysis, discipline... Logic. Why can't these be the tools for the Autobots?"" —Prowl

And without giving anything away in the comics, he's even willing to do highly amoral and immoral actions in order to win the war quickly and efficiently, and all without an interest in getting credit.

I kinda want Centipeetle to be like this. Someone who's a crystal gem and wants to protect humanity, but doesn't agree with Rose's tactics and views Gems like Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl as unstable mavericks. Maybe she'd befriend Steven because he's more of a peaceful, outside-the-box thinker and not a brash warrior.

Would this be a good fit? What are you guys hoping for with Centipeetle?

**Penguin: Pain and Prejudice:** Known for being one of the more intelligent and sophisticated villain in Batman's rouges gallery, this comic dives into just how ruthless and black hearted this character can be. Dare I call it Penguin's 'The killing joke'?

**Deadpool kills the Marvel Universe:** Ever wonder what would happen if Deadpool went off the deep end (more than usual) and decided to kill every hero and villain in Marvel? This comic quenches that wonderment. It also has two sequal comics called Deadpool killustrated and Deadpool kills Deadpool I recommend.

**Joker by Brian Azzarello:** Remember that one episode of Batman TAS were a low level crook wants to become a big shot but gets in over his head when he teams up with Joker? Imagine the rated R version of that, and you got this comic.

**Transformers IDW collection:** Great reads for any Transformers fan, this comic series takes a darker look into the war between Autobots and Deceptions.

**The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl.** My more light hearted recommendation. A simple, funny comic series about an energenic Squirrel based heroine.

My hopes for Blue are kinda weird, but hear me out. Did anyone wonder why Blue let the rubies and other gems fight? You'd think because Diamonds are so powerful she'd take care of Rose and Pearl herself. I Headcanon that she's gotten so good at combat, it's actually boring to her now. She hates her job, not because it's morally wrong, but that it doesn't bring any joy or pleasure to her.

As for White Diamond? I would probably like something to contrast the cold hearted tyrants. Someone who's funny and charismatic, but still ruthless and self centered.

They're pretty darn tough, when you think about it. Break one into shards, you get Frybo and the arms from 'Secret Team'. (Although the arms wouldn't exactly be tough to defeat, but whatever) You grind one into dust or paint, you get together breakfast monster. They almost seem unkillable.

But I rewatched 'Together Breakfast' recently and realized something.

When the deed is done, the smoke that possessed the together breakfast doesn't come back. No one bubbles anything. It's gone for good.

I'm probably grasping at straws here, but I think it's safe to say that the smoke, which is the life essence of a gem, died. So I guess gems are killable with a special kind of gem lava?

What do you guys think was the reason behind Rose's decision?

My theory is a little out there, but I'll put it here anyway. I think it's something similar to the reason why Ultron built Vision in Age of Ultron. Ultron wanted to appear as a savoir to humanity once his plan . So he built a more heroic looking body that eventually became Vision.

*I was meant to be new, I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked up to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead, they'll look up in horror because of you.* - Ultron

I think Rose wanted something similar with Steven. Rose wanted to be a protector of humanity, but in 'We need to talk' it's clear she doesn't fully understand them. She couldn't just protect humans, she needed to **be** human. I wish I could go into more detail about my theory, but I'm pressed for time. Feel free to add on to or comment on my theory.

Through a series of events, he encounters an A.I. version of Jack. No one can see him except Rhys. As the story goes forward, Rhys realizes that the man he idolized is actually an egotistical, careless, megalomaniacal madman.

I want something similar to happen with Steven. Encountering a spirit-like version of Rose threw his gem that only he can see and slowly finding out she's not as good a person as the crystal gems make her out to be.

SU definitely has a great voice actor cast. One thing that they accomplish is how their voices fit the designs of the characters. For example, let's pretend you had no idea what Steven's voice sounded like and had to guess based on his design. He looks young and nice, so you'd think he'd have a young and nice voice. It fits the design. 

This, of course, isn't the only way to create a good and fitting voice for a character. So discuss below on why you thing the voice acting is great.",stevenuniverse,Voice actor appreciation post!,https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/3p4hv0/voice_actor_appreciation_post/

While I’m mostly indifferent on the subject, but I thought of something that could be quite interesting. What if Jasper becomes like Dreadwing from Transformers Prime.

For those who haven’t watched Transformers Prime, I’ll give you the basics on who Dreadwing is. Dreadwing is a decepticon who’s fiercely loyal to Megatron and values honor. His brother, Skyquake, was killed under Starscream’s command and was later raised from the dead. While Dreading is furious at this discovery, Megatron doesn’t punish Starscream for this.

Disillusioned with the Decepticon cause, Dreadwing stole a powerful weapon and delivered it to Optimus, his only request that Optimus put it to good use. Optimus tried to recruit him to be an autobot, but Dreadwing responds with “Betraying my kind is not the same as joining yours.”

I feel like Jasper could go through a similar arc. She starts to question the ways of homeworld, sabotages their operations, but still refuses to join the crystal gems.

(Join the crystal gems) I'm kinda indifferent on the subject. It'd be cool to see them swich sides and change things up, but I wouldn't mind them staying villains. 

But I'm not here to talk about whether it'd be good or stupid if they'd swich sides. I'm here to talk about the possibility of their redemption.

The thing about SU is that it's all about acceptance, compromise, and forgiveness. There's not a single person that Steven, the main character, genuinly hates. He mostly fears the homeworld gems more than anything else. So it's more than likely he'll try to convince the homeworld gems to leave their evil ways behind. Will this work for all of them? Most likely not. There's obviously going to be a villain (Probably Yellow Diamond, but who knows?) That won't buy in to Steven's words. But I wouldn't be surprised if one or more switches sides because of Steven.

Lapis has a fair chance of going the crystal gems. Granted, she has shown hatred towards them, but has shown compassion for Steven as well. It could go either way, but I'm personally leaning towards her joining the crystal gems.

Peridot has a 50/50 chance if you're asking me. She's definitely no angle, but it's fair to say Steven won't just let the gems kill/bubble her. 

Jasper doesn't really have much of a chance for redemption, for obvious reasons. But I wouldn't say it's impossible. We've still got alot of episodes to go through. Will we get more of Jasper's backstory? Will she become more complicated? Only time will tell.

Mostly with the mom characters. But what I like about it is the different ways they show it.

Instead of an overprotective mom that doesn't want her daughter to do dangerous stuff but learns to accept it, we've got a mom that tries too hard to make her daughter happy and learns not to push her daughter into things she doesn't want to do. 

It shows that there's more than one way to not properly raise a child. Being overprotective isn't the ONLY negative thing a parent can do. Sometimes they can be too suppotive. I'm really glad they showed that.

P.S. sorry if this is worded weirdly. I'm pretty tired. I hope you still understand where I'm coming from.",stevenuniverse,Mom parallels (Spoilers for Sadie's song),https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/3ldohg/mom_parallels_spoilers_for_sadies_song/

The New Lars: I'm curious to see what this episode will hold. I personally hope it's about Lars changing his dink ways and asking Steven for advice on how to be a good person. 

Catch and release: I feel like this is gonna be a really funny episode. I think it'll involve someone visiting Steven, asking to go to the bathroom, and it turns out Steven's bathroom turns out to be this huge magic room with scented candles and fancy soaps and a bunch of magic stuff.

I think Dr. Maheswaran took Rose's sword from Connie. How/why else would it be at a hospital. But if it's because she learned about Connie sword fighting, why would she bring it to a hospital and not just lock it in a closet or something? 


This is where my guess takes a weird turn. 


Maybe she wants to give it to someone else in exchange for something. Whether it be a random mob boss or Peridot in a trenchcoat is anyone's guess. What would she get in exchange for the sword? I have to possibilities.


1.) To keep her family safe. Someone threatened Dr. Maheswaran and her family and demanded cash. She doesn't have the amount he/she wants, so she hopes giving him/her a one of a kind sword will work.


2.) She needs surgery, and her insurance won't cover it. Someone offers to help in exchange for cash. Once again, she doesn't have the amount he/she is asking for and hopes the sword will work.


But that's just what I think. Most likely won't happen. What do you guys think will happen?


EDIT: Someone theorized that Connie and her mom accidently switched bags. Steven and Connie go to fix it. Connie's mom is mad/upset but then they get attacked by a corrupted gem, Connie and Steven have to fight to protect her mom. While this makes the most sense, how did a corrupted gem get inside the hospital? Most of them are pretty big and probably couldn't fit in a small hallway.",stevenuniverse,"As Nightmare Hospital draws closer and closer, let's discuss what we think it'll be about",https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/3ipyzk/as_nightmare_hospital_draws_closer_and_closer/

I think Dr. Maheswaran took Rose's sword from Connie. How/why else would it be at a hospital. But if it's because she learned about Connie sword fighting, why would she bring it to a hospital and not just lock it in a closet or something? 


This is where my guess takes a weird turn. 


Maybe she wants to give it to someone else in exchange for something. Whether it be a random mob boss or Peridot in a trenchcoat is anyone's guess. What would she get in exchange for the sword? I have to possibilities.


1.) To keep her family safe. Someone threatened Dr. Maheswaran and her family and demanded cash. She doesn't have the amount he/she wants, so she hopes giving him/her a one of a kind sword will work.


2.) She needs surgery, and her insurance won't cover it. Someone offers to help in exchange for cash. Once again, she doesn't have the amount he/she is asking for and hopes the sword will work.


But that's just what I think. Most likely won't happen. What do you guys think will happen?


EDIT: Someone theorized that Connie and her mom accidently switched bags. Steven and Connie go to fix it. Connie's mom is mad/upset but then they get attacked by a corrupted gem, Connie and Steven have to fight to protect her mom. While this makes the most sense, how did a corrupted gem get inside the hospital? Most of them are pretty big and probably couldn't fit in a small hallway.",stevenuniverse,What do you guys think Nightmare hospital will be about?,http://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/3foko4/what_do_you_guys_think_nightmare_hospital_will_be/

Personally, I think that's a bit harsh to assume that. That's like saying Disney doesn't like Inside out because they advertise Frozen more.


Now I'm not saying CN is completely blameless. I also find it odd that they advertise shows like UG and TTG alot more than SU. (It's totally OK if you like UG and TTG. It's just not my cup of tea.) But that's no reason to think CN doesn't care about SU.


CN renewed it for a third season for crying out loud! AND they're gonna release graphic novels and books later this year! So it's safe to say CN cares about the show.


I suppose the question remains, WHY does CN advertise UG and TTG so much? In my opinion, and I could be totally wrong about this, but I think it involves their target audience. We need to remember that CN is primarily a children's channel. And while adults can enjoy cartoons just as much as children, CN is more concerned with their younger demographic. UG and TTG are very popular among children. And while it's still important to push more intelligent cartoons for children, they're always gonna want something silly, random, and not much thinking required for a simple laugh.


In conclusion, CN likes SU just as much as any other cartoon they have. They just don't advertise it as much... For some reason.

Ian Jq said and I quote that there are ""NO Steven Universe fillers""(excluding Say Uncle for obvious reasons. ""None of this is canon!"") and that ""world-building takes time"" 

A good example is that the episode 'Secret Team' had gem shards that turned into hands. This ties into 'Keeping it together' with gem shards being fused together and Making a mix of body parts.

Even though everything in his life is how he wanted it to be, and even at one point accepts it, there's still small hints that everything is not what it seems.

Yellow Diamond: Head of technology. All about progress and hates all lifeforms that aren't as advance as homeworld. A pure narcissist who brags that she's the smartest gem alive. Do to living in a high standard society for thousands of years, she became a spoiled, classy snob who views killing countless people as a vacation. (Basically Aurelia from Borderlands the pre-sequal) 

""I'm bored now. Someone dance for my amusement""- Aurelia.

Blue Diamond: In charge of military. Cold, merciless, and honorable to a fault. A master strategist with a cunning mind, she's the type of woman that's all work and zero nonsense. She wants to make her enemies suffer and eventually die slowly and painfully. Not because she's sadistic, but because she wants her enemies punished for going against homeworld. She's willing to scar people physically, mentally, and emotionally. (Basically Scarecrow from Arkham Knight)

""And when the dawn comes, when Gotham lies in ruins and I turn my gaze to the world beyond. The legend of the Batman... Will be worth nothing. At. All.""- Scarecrow.

White Diamond: All about Spin-control and negotiation. She's a charismatic, passive-agressive, egocentric, megalomaniac who genuinely thinks that she's a hero to her kind. Unlike the other Diamonds, she has more of a sense of humor and isn't afraid to make fun of her partners.   And while Blue and Yellow hate other primitive species, White Diamond just laughs at them. (Basically Pagan Min from Far cry 4)

Or at least not putting earth on top of their priority list. 
The reason why I think this comes from the episode 'Marble madness'. After Pearl gives her ""We are the crystal gems!"" Speech, Peridot just blankly stares back at them and asks ""The crystal gems?"" Let's think about that for a second. The crystal gems are basically people that formed a rebellion, chose humans over their own kind, probably killed HUNDREDS of homeworld soldiers, and Peridot doesn't know about them? Unless she flunked gem-history class, something's not right here.

Plus, when Peridot does report on them, homeworld sends ONE war veteran (Jasper) and a singal warship to deal with them. Don't you think homeworld would send more gems and firepower to deal with the crystal gems? Heck, Peridot even says that the whole point of going to earth was to ""check the cluster"" and NOT bring back traitors of homeworld.

So here's my take in all of this. After the end of the gem war, homeworld decided that if Rose really wanted a big ball of dirt and saltwater, she could have it. So they left earth and moved on. Thousands of years later, they decide to see if Rose and the other crystal gems were still alive. (Peridot mentioned that the red eye from the second episode ""didn't pick up any gems on this plant."") After that, they sent Peridot to reactivate the kindergarten and check on the cluster. Once Peridot reported that there WERE gems on earth, they decide to just send Jasper to deal with it.

I wouldn't be too surprised if Sardonyx, a possible new gem coming, turns out to be some type of bounty hunter/mercenary/gun for hire that homeworld decided to hire to find Jasper, Lapis and Peridot so they wouldn't waste more resources on earth.

But that's just my opinion/headcannon, what do you guys think?",stevenuniverse,Does homeworld actually care about earth?,http://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/3bg71h/does_homeworld_actually_care_about_earth/

There's not much proof behind them and I'll understand if you don't agree. With that out of the way, let's begin.

People have already given my theories on who or what Sardonyx is. My theory is a bit more... out there.

First, Sardonyx a fusion? While I agree that Sardonyx may be a fusion, I don't think it's one of Peridot and Jasper or Garnet and Pearl. It is the WEEK of Sardonyx after all. So a fusion of those characters wouldn't make much sense. Let's look at the definition of Sardonyx: onyx in which white layers alternate with sard. So maybe Sardonyx is fusion like Garnet, with two new characters. (Sard and Onyx)

Next, is Sardonyx a crystal gem or a homeworld gem? While signs point to homeworld gem, I feel like the crewniverse are gonna throw a curve ball at us with this. I feel like Sardonyx might be a bounty hunter/mercenary/gun for hire that homeworld decided to use and not waste resources. I don't know, maybe me thinking that Sardonyx will be a bounty hunter is just the part of my brain that thinks bounty hunters are awesome.

Finally, what will Sardonyx bring exactly to SU? From what I've gathered, The gemstone Sardonyx brings people confidence, optimism, and other similar things. So maybe Sardonyx will do that to some SU characters? Like tell Pearl that she needs to let Rose go and to not view herself as nothing? Probably not gonna happen, but it's worth bringing up I suppose.

That's basically what I think Sardonyx will be. I'd love to hear what you guys have to think of this.",stevenuniverse,Who is Sardonyx,http://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/3aj99m/who_is_sardonyx/

Recently, Pearl has shown very obsessive and self-destructive traits when it came to protecting Rose during the war. Even after the war, she held on to these feelings that practically shaped her into the gem we know today. I realized that this is somewhat similar to another character in fiction.

If you aren't familiar with the web series Red vs Blue, there is a character named Locus. Simply put, Locus is a cold hearted, quite, and somewhat sadistic mercenary who'd throw his own mother under the tracks if that was an order given to him by a superior. He seemingly displays a cynical/realist perspective on life, bearing the viewpoint that soldiers aren't meant to care for anyone or anything other then completing the objective to how they see fit. 

But he wasn't always like this. We learn in a flashback, long before he became a mercenary, Locus was initially a more reasonable and compassionate soldier while serving under the army during a Great War. The squad he was part of cornered an enemy soldier and his captain orders to kill him. Locus suggests that they restrain the enemy rather than mindlessly kill him. His captain snaps at him and says ""You're a soldier! In this war, you are nothing but a suit of armor and a gun! So when I give you an order you damn well follow it! Do I make myself clear?!?"" Locus became who he is because his captain drilled in his head that he was JUST a soldier.

That got me thinking. Did something similar happen to Pearl? Perhaps Rose told her to protect her and she Pearl took it too far. Maybe Pearl figured that if Rose fell in battle, the whole rebellion would fall. So she took it upon herself to protect her at all costs. Whether this was brought on by Rose or Pearl herself is another story.

Another similarity between Pearl and Locus is that Locus tried to pass his ideology on Washington, a professional soldier who cares deeply for his friends, like Pearl did to Connie.

But a question remains. Why did these two not move on after their participation in their wars?  I think it's common knowledge that war is a horrible and chaotic thing. All the killing, death, and violence can change a good person for the worst. Greg said it himself, there's no such thing as a good war. Soldiers constantly deal with psychological/mental problems even after the war is over. That's the reason Locus became a mercenary, he couldn't go to a normal life after what he did.

In conclusion: Pearl and Locus are psychologically damaged characters who took their roles in war too far. Locus taking orders no matter what, and Pearl protecting her leader no matter what.",stevenuniverse,Soldiers after war (in regards to Pearl's actions in Sworn to the sword),http://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/3a5w44/soldiers_after_war_in_regards_to_pearls_actions/
