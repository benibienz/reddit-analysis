0,I have a question. How strong is Ã†ther Vial in this deck? Is it necessary for this deck? (I am not asking this because of financial reasons.),2016-10-14 05:21:19+00:00,d8re4rb,1.0,t3_57c56i,35561.0,ModernMagic
1,"Hello!
Before I made a post recently asking about esper twix I looked at several links:

The Ali Aintrazi List, but be sure to look at the first comment on the article, it provided an updated deck-list at the time: http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=12585

GreatNate's Youtube playlist of it: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaUnM24uNg0D-Djxr20z3lxAZh3cbRhyD

And this mtgsalvation thread: http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/developing-competitive-modern/579970-buw-aggro-control-esper-midrange

None of these are really new, the only really recent ones is the Esper deadguy player who commented earlier. I hope some of these links help! Let me know what deck-list you end up with, I'd be very interested in knowing.",2016-10-13 17:59:34+00:00,d8qjzxg,1.0,t3_57adpa,14413.0,ModernMagic
2,UWROV might be looking for more members. It is pretty much a robotics club.,2016-10-13 01:21:22+00:00,d8pnkda,1.0,t3_577mhb,1504.0,udub
3,Do you mind if I see your Esper spirits list? I am considering building it myself.,2016-10-02 17:57:47+00:00,d8b0mku,1.0,t3_55f5sa,75398.0,ModernMagic
4,Thank you! I picked up UB Delve(r) last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed the deck! I was also able to pilot the deck to 3/4 place out 31 people at a local Pauper tournament! Thank you for the suggestion!,2016-09-17 07:12:58+00:00,d7qbe5i,,t1_d7ekmr8,,Pauper
5,"Hello! 
I mainly play EDH/Commander, but I would like to start playing a 60 card format. I am typically considered a spikey MtG Player, and I like playing free counterspells and/or wrath effects. If I were to build a Modern deck it would probably be Mono Blue delver or Esper Thopter Gifts Ungiven. My two favourite EDH decks are Tasigur Draw-Go Control, and Sydri Artifact Control &amp; Combo. 

What does r/Pauper recommend for me?
Thank you for your help!

6,"Hello! Can you please explain more about ATM S 111? Things like what the homework was like, do students have to write essays or papers, how much studying and reading there was, etc.? Thank you for the help!",2016-08-11 05:19:51+00:00,d6cvtgg,,t1_d697gzc,,udub
7,"Thanks for the feedback. I've already tested out of Phys 121 with a 5 on the Physics C Mechanics Exam. I've also already had some programming experience from toying with MatLab and taking AP computer science, but I only got a 3. 
I have earned a 5 on the Calculus BC exam so I don't have to take math 124 or math 125. I also have little Idea of what I could take as a ""fun' class, with the only class standing out to me being ATM S 111 (Frierson). I enjoy classes that make me solve problems and require critical thinking. I hate classes that require me to write essays. I've always done very well in math and science classes, but I'm afraid of overwhelming myself. I probably should have added this information in my original comment. Any feedback is appreciated.

8,"Hello! I am an out of state freshman student that is aiming for Computer Engineering.
Is this schedule acceptable for the first quarter? 
Right now I am looking at taking:
CSE 142 (Reges), Phys 122 (Morales), Math 126 but if it is still unavailable I will probably take ATM S 111 (Frierson)
Any advice or feedback on this schedule?",2016-08-07 05:57:47+00:00,d67j2t8,1.0,t3_4uhdm1,1117864.0,udub
