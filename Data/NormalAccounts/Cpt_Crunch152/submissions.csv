 I have not been able to find any recent information on the deck, can anybody shed some light on what happened to it or how strong it is currently? If not, can anyone recommend a similar deck?

(Main article regarding the deck: http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=12585).

There also seems to have been a Facebook group, but I think it was deleted. (https://www.facebook.com/EsperTwix).
