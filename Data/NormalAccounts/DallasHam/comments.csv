1,He has already said he isn't asking that much. Just his worth. I agree we have other players to hold onto but its going to depend on who our coach is and what scheme we run.

I get that he wanted that number but he wanted because of the Jordan contract. I just don't think it's a big deal. You play for millions of dollars shouldn't be worried about a number.

I live in Denver and listen to nothing but Sports Radio and after this year the Broncos most likely will start rebuilding. They need to fix their cap.

141,"Obviously they werent ""lazy"" im sure it was a lot of hard work and dedication but the story wasnt much of change. There wasnt much of an ""effort"" to change anything. Like you have the biggest franchise in movie history and you  know its going to make money. Do something different. Change it up do something big that's gonna make people be like ""holy shit that was in a star wars movie"". Instead they changed the main lead to a girl, which is fine, and killed someone off. I'm not trying to bash the movie I enjoyed the movie to a certain extent. I guess I just wish they would have done something way different. I get that Kennedy and Disney have a plan for Star Wars and they are trying to set a foundation for other people to take off with it. Rian Johnson hopefully will turn it around and bring in something crazy that will blow the people who have been die hard star wars fans since day one away. I don't think it's naive to say that they were lazy when it comes to writing the story. All the hard work that goes into  making a movie is truly amazing but when it comes to writing a story and you just pretty much copy the original when you say it's a brand new star wars is lazy in my opinion. You're getting paid millions to write a movie why not throw some crazy twist. This is just my opinion who knows what happen  behind the scenes. Maybe Walt Disney was resurrected from the dead and said it must be this way or else. Maybe they knew that the original worked so well that they thought why not just copy it pretty much we know it will sell. WHO KNOWS I sure dont.

Its a money pit because they make everything from year 1 useless so you have to buy the taken king to get all the new stuff. It is a money pit. This is how the game should of been when it first came out. Instead we've all had to pay excess amounts to finally get a full game but in the process losing all the gear we worked towards in year one. So, by asking players to keep buying dlc and if you don't then the game wont be as fun isn't right in my opinion. Look at the The Witcher who is releasing a bunch of free DLC content then releasing a huge expansion. That's how it should be done. I still play destiny. Im playing it as I write this but it just sucks it came down to this for a game. ",2015-09-18 22:35:51+00:00,cv6dppo,3.0,t1_cv6cpmk,1859,gaming

Plus with the change of red lava, or whatever it was, to green shit is an obvious sign the test screenings went bad. This movie had a lot of trouble with shooting as well. Fox hasn't even signed on for another movie yet because they were worried about Josh Tranks handling of a big budget movie. In my opinion this movie will be just as bad as the originals. Dont make a fantastic four movie unless its like comics which were cheesy as fuck but thats how comics were back then when they first came out. I mean Super Man fought a giant spider.
