So the day before the incident I went to a The Bronx concert with my older brother and he had gotten me a t-shirt as a gift. The shirt said ""White Drugs"" on it in huge white lettering, it was the name of their album that year. So I go to school the next day and I wear my fresh shirt and all my friends are saying what a cool shirt it is and that its funny. Well about half way through the day I hear my name called over the intercom to come to the principal's office. Let me remind you that I was not a kid who got in trouble. I kept my mouth shut and did my school work. So, I'm walking to the principal's office sweating bullets and shaking profusely. I get into the office and the principal, assistant principal, a cop and a drug dog are waiting in the office. As all of them stare me down I ever so slowly sit down at the principal's desk. He looks at me and says ""So you think selling drugs at school is cool, huh?"" I was so confused because I had never touched any crazy drugs at the age of 13, well one year later I smoked pot, but that's another story for another time. So, I was so confused I didn't know what to say except for ""Excuse me?"" Well that was the wrong answer to say as the Cop slammed his fist on the table and said ""WE KNOW YOURE SELLING DRUGS WE HAVE PROOF NOW CONFESS OR IM GOING TO SEARCH YOUR LOCKER!!"" Now, let me remind you all again I am 13 years old, skinny and white as hell. I'm shaking in my Emerica Reynolds 2 at this point and am so confused all i could say was ""I have no idea what you're talking about I don't have any drugs"" well once again that was the wrong answer and the principal proceeds to yell at me tell me that my shirt is a ""dead give away"" that I sell drugs. He told me I was a ""walking advertisement for selling cocaine"". I tried to tell them that it was a band and it is the name of their album but they refused to believe me or even look it up on the computer. So they drag me out of the office to my locker to have the drug dog sniff it for coke and other crazy drugs that I supposedly had. Well they don't find anything because I'm not a coke dealer and the cop looks at me after it all and says ""I will find those drugs on you so help me god"". Now let me remind everyone I AM 13 YEARS OLD and this is how they fucking treated me. They proceeded to call my parents and tell them I have coke and that if I don't tell them where it is that I will be expelled because you know you can expel kids from school without any evidence...who knew? Well my mom leaves work comes to the school to talk to the principal. My mom is such a bad bitch she laughed in his face and told him straight up that he is ""an idiot for accusing my son for selling coke because of what a tshirt says"" she pulls out the The Bronx CD with the cover that says ""White Drugs"" on it. She then gets up grabs my hand and tells me where leaving. The principal is in shock and won't even say a word. As were leaving my mom looks at the cop, who had the drug dog with him earlier, and says ""Do your fucking job and actually get some goddamn evidence before you go accusing 13 year olds of selling cocaine"" and then we walked out. The next day at school the principal apologized to me and then announced his retirement that same day.
