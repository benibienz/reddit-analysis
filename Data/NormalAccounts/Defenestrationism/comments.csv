They literally could not understand the concept that it is controlled by the ambient temperature and has two modes for both the heat and A.C.  FUCKING **ON** AND FUCKING **OFF**!!! THAT'S IT, THAT'S ALL!!! **ON AND OFF**!!!  Jacking  it way up or way down does not put the furnace or A.C. into hyper-mode where it heats up or cools down much faster.  It happens at the exact same rate as if it is set to the proper temperature!  Meanwhile, the exotic fish in my department (fish department, pet store) start getting sick and dying because these jackwads forget the dialed it way up or down and these critters rely on it being consistently mid-high 70s.  This came to a head a few years ago when my boss yelled at me about the excess propane/electrical consumptions and I tossed all the ones who were responsible for it under the bus to get her off my back.

-related storytime: I used to have a coworker I'll call Jason (not his real name).  
Jason was uncomfortable with it when people didn't do things his way.  
Jason thought he was way smarter than he actually was and desperately wanted to be a manager.  
Jason thought he knew how to do everyone else's job better than them. 
Jason tried to constantly coerce everyone into doing things his way.  
Jason's way of doing things was often not better, it was frequently worse or about the same.
Jason generally pissed off everyone by manipulating others against them when they didn't do things exactly his way.  
Jason one day bit off more than he could chew, so to speak, by trying that shit with me.  
Jason thought I didn't have the balls to call him out on his bullshit, manipulation, control freak tendencies, embarrassing him in front of the other staff.  
Jason was wrong.  
Jason now works elsewhere in a position where he doesn't have to be around people.
Everyone is now happier.

I have a few neighbors with large tracts of land and they keep catching the same hunters on the same land several times.  A couple years ago one called the local Fish &amp; Game Warden and the Warden came and personally escorted a couple of the hunters off the land and warned them that if they trespassed again they'd go to jail.

While I may thrive on detail and find it interesting, most others don't, but feel free to expand on your point if they ask further questions.  Initially, one should only convey only as much information as is needed to get your main point across.

168,"I feel your frustration.  I was raised with southern Baptists and various evangelical types. Whenever a sex crime happened or a girl got pregnant outside of marriage, there was very little pity for those who were victimized and/or impregnated.  The first line of inquiry was always about what the victim or pregnant person did to deserve or encourage it while their side of the story was often not believed at all.  It was heavily implied that men just couldn't help themselves and weren't as responsible for controlling themselves as women were, so the onus was almost completely on the woman to stay safe.  When you think about it, that's straight up misandry combined with misogyny.


Someone very close to me was once molested and, instead of going after the perpetrator, they told her to shut up about it, that she probably invited and encouraged it, etc. the person who did this was a client of the family business and apparently the extra income was more important than the victim's mental health and physical safety.

I don't know... have met at least a couple people similar to that who got that way because mommy and daddy always treated them like they were special, rescued them when they failed instead of turning it into a teachable moment, and generally didn't allow their precious baby to be subject to consequences for being a generally shitty person.  One of them definitely didn't fare well as I think he's still in jail.  The other one, not sure of.  Never heard from him again and I can't say that bothers me.  ;-)

The stuff you outlined in your first paragraph is eerily familiar to me.  I used to have a coworker who was similar, though more of just an attention-seeking narcissist who liked to start trouble, I don't think she was a full-blown psychopath.  She liked to come off like she and her family had their whole act together and it would be perfect if not for her fuck-up of a son.  Just last year I realized when talking to my best friend, that years ago this friend also was a teacher/counselor (in a school for troubled kids) for their 'fuck up son' and he gave me an entirely different story than what the kid's mother gave to me.  As it turns out, their youngest son ended up a complete fuck-up because he has seriously fucked up parents who present really well to the outside world but were generally dysfunctional assholes behind closed doors and made the poor kid's life at home a living hell while they doted on his older brother and treated him like their precious golden child. That could screw up any kid.

Anyhow, I got off on a tangent... but it kinda relates.  My point I guess was that those who brag the most are often the most deficient in other areas.

197,"1. Emphatically YES.  My sister was the first one to lead me down the path to diagnosis somewhere around a half decade ago, as she had heavily suspected I was on the spectrum for a while.  Finally being able to figure out why I was so strange and different from everyone else kinda gave me a mild identity crisis for a while, but it also enabled me to seek out resources and ways to retrain my mind and social presentation to be mindful of my social deficits.  All in all, I'm glad that I found out.  I'd rather deal with objective truths, even difficult ones, than to go on muddling around in a state of semi-confusion.

2. She may be (badly) using statements like that to open up a dialogue concerning a suspicion she already has about you, but it's hard to tell based on what you've related so far.  While some people choose not to go around sharing their diagnosis status with most others, I do think it's important for one to tell those closest to them.  How they receive that information will vary according to the individual, and if they receive it badly, give them time to process it and come to terms with it if they are someone you really care about and respect, but if they continue to stay firmly in a negative position on that, it may be a signal that they aren't someone should have in your life in a major capacity.",2016-09-18 15:27:39+00:00,d7ru3py,1.0,t3_53cicg,1220.0,aspergers

Naturally they became something of a local attraction and they didn't seem to mind people standing a respectful distance away at the edge of the field to take pictures. 

 My brother and I went to take a look and I literally had to physically block this jack-wad from Mass. who apparently didn't understand the concept that nature is not a petting zoo and moose are not sweet and cuddly (they actually smell pretty bad too, btw) was proceeding to walk into the field, holding his toddler daughter aloft in front of him.  

Mother moose started to stamp her front feet and lower her head, which is moose-speak for ,*""Back off or I'll fuck you up, asshole!""* I asked him wtf he thought he was doing... he was somehow convinced the moose was domesticated and he wanted to get a picture of his daughter sitting on it's back.  I couldn't believe it. 

 It took a little convincing, but I finally got it through to him that he was trying to walk up to a wild animal and putting both himself and his daughter in serious danger, and some of the other people standing nearby backed me up.  If it was just him I probably would have just let him try it after the first time he tried to dismiss me, but the other folks and I couldn't watch him put that kid at such risk.  It was a little sobering for me to see IRL that there are people who are actually that stupid.

Even many of the cheaper models have functions like night vision, motion-sensing, are usually lockable with any padlock, can be used to snap stills or take videos of varying lengths.  

Be sure to research the camera's capabilities before buying and if you have any questions on good models to buy, the good folks over on /r/hunting can probably give you much better advice than I can.  With what little I know,  I strongly recommend that you get a model capable of at least 720p video if not 1080p or higher (or if snapping still shots, at least 5megapixel or more, with a decent radius of coverage) as that makes it much easier to grab images capable of positive identification by authorities if necessary.  You can set up such a camera in areas where entry to your property is likely and/or areas with things which they like to vandalize.  Be sure to brush up on local ordinances governing surveillance.  In some areas it may be illegal to set up cameras in such a way which they cover parts of someone else's property, but setting them up in a way which records only areas of your own property is generally accepted as legal in most areas AFAIK.

If you go the game/trail camera route, make sure to mount them securely in an area where they can't be messed with easily.  I wish you the best of luck.

Edit: if you are looking to catch them in the act more easily.  Install the camera in a hidden fashion when they aren't home so that they aren't even aware of it.  This makes it far more likely that you will catch them in the act.   Installing the camera in a hidden fashion and leaving something in it's field of view to serve as tempting bait could accelerate your ability to gain footage/evidence which you can immediately turn over to the authorities so that they can be properly dealt with.  Also make sure that you are reporting everything which happens (and you suspect them of) to your local authorities so that there is a record, which will make prosecution and stiffer sentencing much easier if it comes to that.",2016-08-14 18:08:04+00:00,d6haqe8,1.0,t3_4xo1st,17580.0,raisedbynarcissists

When I turned my head a saw a large pickup still coming to a screeching halt while some poor guy was flying through the air and landed right on the curb, crumpled and lifeless, as parts of what used to be his motorcycle went scattering all over the road.  I thought I just watched someone bite the big one and felt kinda sick about it for a few days afterward.  Fortunately it was just fifty yards from the police and fire station so they were on the scene in about a minute.  It turned out to be an elderly driver speeding up the street and not paying attention as the motorcyclist pulled out into traffic.  I found out a few days later that the guy had been taken up to Dartmouth hospital and was seriously injured, but expected to survive.  Still, seeing stuff like that sticks with you.

303,"That's a great sub and it helped me a lot with gaining further sanity and understanding the mechanics of the fucked up relationship I've had with my own father, who is a textbook Narcissist.  The advice I would give anyone going to that sub is to dive in, share your experience, and learn from that of others, but be careful not to let others' experiences cause you to keep rehashing bad feelings, there needs to be a point at which you have to put it away and go on with your life.  This is why I am no longer subscribed there.  They are a wonderful and supportive community and I highly recommend them for people going through the same crap that OP is going through, but be careful not to let the culture of the sub suck you in and keep you depressed.  This is not the fault of the sub, this is just how it is. For me, they were a stepping stone to understand what I was dealing with, but not a permanent stop in my mission to figure things out and deal with them properly.  With that said, that sub helped me to figure out a lot of good tricks and gain more self-confidence for dealing with abusive narcissists in my life.

304,"Hey there OP, I feel for you on that.  It was kind of similar with my parents, who were conservatively religious and strict about the stuff they would let my brother and I watch on TV.  We literally were not allowed to watch even PG-13 movies in our mid-late teens (unless those movies had some kind of religious message they approved of).  This compounded my lack of social development and made it difficult when I got out into the real world.  I glutted on popular music, movies, and other media for at least a decade after leaving my parents' home and finally have mostly caught up.  

It sounds like you are at least partially justified and your mother spoke and acted from a place of ignorance, much as my own did, even if our situations were a bit different.  The real question is, does it mean enough to you to be worth pursuing the issue to a potentially bitter end?  I had to ,mostly cut my parents out of my life for well over a decade because they are toxic individuals... one with definite Narcissistic Personality Disorder, the other with mild-moderate Histrionic Personality Disorder and they refuse to acknowledge any of the profoundly fucked up things they've done over the years... like not protecting a family member from a molester (then blaming her for it and refusing to take legal action against the predator), kicking me out when they found out I'm gay, being abusive hypocrites in the name of their religion, etc.  I had to cut them off for my own sanity and eventually allowed them back in my life in a very limited capacity where I am still in complete control of the relationship and don't have to rely on them for anything critical which I can't do without. 

 If your mother's lack of perspective and empathy is enough of a problem, it may be worth putting some distance between you and her for a while, and that may even send your message to her much clearer than words ever could.  But I don't know your situation or relationships that well so don't take this as being a proper solution unless it seems like the best one after objectively evaluating the whole thing.   As with anyone else, including your mother, take a while to think over what that person brings to the table in terms of your relationship with them, and whether or not it is worth staying as close as you are to them.  It is not a decision to take lightly and the solution varies according to the person/situation/relationship so there is no boilerplate advice I can give you on this.  I can only say that, for me, cutting them off from my life and putting a lot of distance between us has been good for my own sanity, but my situation is kind of unique.  Keep in mind that lack of empathy can be immensely frustrating when dealing with it in other people, but empathy can be taught, though teaching it sometimes takes extreme measures.  Also, nobody is perfect and everyone has their own flaws.  Judge for yourself whether or not tolerating their flaws is worth keeping them in your life, or at least as close as they currently are.",2016-08-14 16:02:45+00:00,d6h5qve,1.0,t3_4xnefz,26588.0,aspergers

313,"&gt;You're not alone in that at all. I only know which rules can be broken by watching others. If I have no experience with the situation, then I'm at a loss. 

Much the same here.  That's the only way I've ever learned which rules are OK to break.  On the same subject, within the last few years I've thrown off all pretense of being Mr. Lawful rule-follower at work.  I was the only one following the rules all the time while everyone else broke them blatantly and frequently, yet I was the one seemingly getting in trouble the most because I was a target.  I also didn't give a shit and didn't report others for breaking rules unless it was serious and/or negatively affected others.  When I started breaking the same rules everyone else did, I used to be the only one getting in trouble over it.  Then I finally grew enough balls to confront my boss about why I was the only one getting in trouble for it when everyone else was doing the same thing right in front of her and she backed right off after I brought up how several of her favorites were the ones violating said rules the most.  There's way more to the story than that but I'll cut the story short there.  The result of all of this: after I had the balls to stand up to her, she has left me alone since then.  Note: my boss is actually a really good person, but she is very easy to manipulate and some of her favorites were manipulative types who didn't like me.

383,"We will see if it stays civil.  Speaking from my own perspective,  I have no issue with feminism and I 100% support the fight for gender equality, not least because I was raised in a conservatively religious household and had a front row seat to seeing how they treated my big sister, who is by far the brightest and best of my family.  She got treated like shit growing up (and still is to some extent) because she was unfortunate enough to be born to a set of parents who believe in 'biblical' gender roles (unequal, women subservient and dependent on a man, with no real rights of her own) and my sister had a mind of her own and didn't have a penis (which was apparently required if one wanted to have a mind of their own in my family). She, I, and my brother left that toxic nonsense behind long ago. 

With all that said, I don't particularly like a particular subvariety of literal man-hating extremist feminists in the same way that I don't like sexist red-pill types, or extremists of any philosophical bend or religion... and pretty much all schools of thought/perspective have divisive extremists in their midst who become the uninvited, de facto spokespeople for their cause because the media gives them exposure because it boosts viewership and everyone involved seems to find them more interesting than the majority who are more normal, sane, and reasonable.  Come to think of it, I don't much care for most of the media either for that reason.

464,"I'll also ask you if you have had to deal with emotional abuse or being around a parent/authority figure a lot who is emotionally unstable.  I have had similar issues, with some improvement, particularly in the last decade.  For me, about half of it turned out to be actual autism, but I also come from an environment which had a fair amount of emotional/psychological abuse, which can compound autistic deficits and make it more difficult to discern those kinds of things.  

Example: it has literally taken me decades to realize that someone yelling or being angry around me does not necessarily mean they are angry at me or that I am being directly threatened with the results of that anger.  I have to constantly work on not reacting to anger from others unless it is directed at me, and being able to tell whether or not it's directed at me was quite a struggle at one time.  I still tense up and feel my heart rate rise whenever I'm exposed to angry behavior which isn't directed at me, but I've gotten better at intercepting my own reactions to it.  To this day though, I still can't be around people who throw things, break things, or yell when they are pissed off because it brings out too many bad memories, so I remove myself to a quieter place when possible.

I ended up learning this stuff the hard way but I hear that these days there are videos tailored to people with ASD which show and teach various emotions and how to appropriately react to them.  I don't have any recommendations though.  There are likely other users here who are more familiar with such things and can give you good advice on which to choose.

One other piece of advice which may or may not be helpful depending on you and your situation...  A lot of my problems stemmed from feeling like I'm in danger, physically threatened, and insecure.

468,"Reactionary?  Yes, probably to a certain extent, but there is a nearly infinite array of other options if one is not able to get sex.  I hold that, barring actual psychosis or some other condition which makes one not in control of their faculties, we are ultimately responsible for what we feel and how we react to what we feel.  Some of us have shittier training in that than others, but how far are we as a species and society willing to go with allowing people leeway in their behavior based on their background and what resources they had available to teach them?  He lives in the internet age where he could have been hitting up websites which taught him how to improve his social game or at least how to cope with the feelings he was having in a constructive fashion instead of websites which taught him to feel more bitter and isolated.  

He still could have sought out other odd-balls and chilled with them.  I also don't personally believe that a lack of sex automatically causes one to go insane unless they allow it to.  It's hard to say whether or not attempting to be social in a typical college scene would have done him any good.  It's completely hypothetical and short of being able to actually tap into his mind in a completely unfettered fashion, I don't think any of us will be able to totally understand his motivations.   

As for the last couple paragraphs you wrote.  I don't believe it's my or anyone else's place to drive other autistics in any particular direction as far as whether or not it's realistic for them to expect physical intimacy at some point in their life.  I'm one of those who is highly self-sufficient and high-functioning, though not necessarily highly educated.  I read a lot but I have only a high school education and some trade school mixed in.  I've suffered a lot from crippling self-doubt and social problems which I've made a concerted effort to rectify, with varying degrees of success... but I'm also gay and, to be honest, it's damn easy to hook up if you are a guy who is into other guys.  As long as you have at least some self-awareness regarding how you come off to others and realistic standards about what you can achieve in dating, hooking up is simple.  If I wanted to I could hop on Grindr, Craigslist personals, or some other hookup forum and be getting it on in 10 minutes, but I don't because that's just not my cup of tea.  I'm just not one of those people who feels like I need sex to go about my life.  When I'm getting it it's generally great but when I'm not, it's just not that big a deal to me.  I've literally been over three years without it at this point because I haven't been actively looking for it and don't feel like I'm missing anything.

All that aside, I've seen people all over the sexuality spectrum who were really objectively ugly and socially stunted (as in worse than the aspie stereotype in some cases) get laid pretty easily because they had realistic standards given their situation/position in life.  So maybe you can understand why I don't think it's my or anyone else's place to tell others what they can or can't achieve in that department.",2016-06-17 02:46:41+00:00,d4cj636,,t1_d46ygt7,,aspergers

I freaking hate that type of tree.  They leak sap everywhere which is impossible to get out of clothes, they grow massive pretty quickly while having only a shallow root system which only extends 6-10 feet horizontally from the base, usually grow only in loose, sandy soil,  so wind tips them over pretty easily.

496,"Interesting set of questions. I'll bite.

 If we're speaking in terms of status categories, my impression is that he was probably in the lower echelons.  That IS fixable to some extent too, even for aspies with fairly pervasive traits,  and that does not necessarily have to mean changing one's base traits, but many can improve their social behavior and social language and even get laid if their standards aren't unreasonable. Some just aren't in the right environments and would be way cooler and more attractive to their preferred gender in the context of a different social scene.

 I've met a fair amount of guys who were either on the spectrum or had aspieish traits, who constantly set their sights too high... as in, if you're a 5 on the 1-10 scale of looks... don't be shooting for 8-10s unless you have a hell of a lot else to offer in some way.   Others were just way too risk averse.  As for finding a long term companion, that certainly takes more social acuity and commitment to compromise, something a fair amount of us struggle with.  It probably takes 3-10x more practice and self examination than for a NT but it's not impossible. Whether or not it's worth it for the individual is the question though.  Even if it's not worth it, that does not justify the choice to go psycho and kill people.  

Would socializing more have yielded better results?  Really hard to say.  Possibly if he had been in a different type of environment with more understanding people... or maybe he was an aspie with a brain defect which tipped him into psychopathy and his violence would have happened anyway.  Maybe his hormones were shooting off hard when he fell into bad ideology and took it way too seriously.  Tough to know exactly.  There are so many things which can fracture a person's mind or cause them to go bad.

Maybe better circumstances and/or role models in his life would have made him turn out better.  I can certainly think of a number of bad turns I could have taken at certain times in my life if not for the right options or the right concerned friend being there at just the right time to help me find better paths in my life.  I come from the kind of background which often gives rise to violent, criminal behavior but you don't see me shooting up movie theaters or politicians.

505,"One thing I found about prioritizing others' expectations... they keep moving the goal posts.  You meet *x* goal, and the people you are trying hard to please are cool with it for a short while, but then they start actively looking for something else to whine about.   I used to be a super nice-guy pushover type who actively invited this nonsense.  Now, instead of trying too hard to connect with others, I just do my own thing, represent as who I really am, and those who like me will generally connect with me anyway and I have to deal with a lot less unreasonable expectations. My social circle is smaller than it used to be as a result of this, but my head is a lot clearer when I'm not having to jump through a million flaming hoops just to meet a fuckload of others' expectations. The friends I have now are way higher-quality too.  If some people don't like me, that's OK.  Nobody can be friends with everyone because not everyone has reasonable expectations.  I can just ignore them and leave them in peace, unless they actively try to mess with me, in which case they typically end up regretting it.

520,"This is a terrible idea.  Religious cults should not be allowed to do what amounts to a take-over of townships.  This happened also in Lempster, NH, close to where I live.  An insular cult started in that town and befriended a bunch of locals, bought up their land, instituted their own budget and directives via majority at town meetings and by shoehorning their members into elected positions, educating all their kids at their own private school while starving the local school of money and resources via their budget-killing power on the various boards/councils.  

The townpeople started getting real pissy about that and started fighting back.  Because the cult is so insular and does not like attention, they decided to move to some other area in northern Maine or Canada as I recall, so they basically moved onto some other township they could exploit.  Because they were one of the main businesses in that town, the mass-exodus left a lot of vacant buildings, pulled away a lot of business and fucked the town budget further, but the town has recovered somewhat on their own since then.  

I also used to work at one of the big businesses owned by this cult, just seasonal work but the small amount of time I spent there was enough for me.  The folks in the cult are very strange, very Stepford-Wife-like.  Not saying that's a reason in and of itself to dislike them, I simply started disliking them after I learned what they were doing to that town.

It's shit like this which is the reason that I am not into having large religious collectives amassing in townships and forcing their will on the locals.  As soon as they are the majority, you can pretty much count on that happening. ",2016-06-04 12:19:01+00:00,d3vne68,1.0,t3_4mclle,86325.0,vermont
521,"I found out later in life that I have asperger's/high-functioning autism, now professionally diagnosed but there really wasn't a well-known classification for what I was when I was a kid.   I was that stereotypical awkward kid who didn't socially interact in a normal way, was kind of a loner, seemed to constantly have a target painted on my back and was frequently intimidated and hit at school.  I stayed passive, sometimes wish I hadn't.

I also started life as an older brother for whom a younger brother kept instigating fights with me. I would try my hardest to avoid him and get away from him, and I'd always kick his ass when he pushed too far, but he kept picking fights, so I'm not sure what he got out of it.  We also had a somewhat abusive father who often hit us for minor offences and constantly made a point of intimidating us.  He also used to beat the dog. That all stopped a week after my 18th birthday when he hit me one time too many and I sent him flying out of my room into the hallway.  Ultimately he turned out to be a coward, as most bullies are, and exited the hallway to get away from me real quick. He tried to get in my face one time after that and I stepped up and directly challenged him.  He backed down.

Not long after that I started taking some basic martial arts classes, became more disciplined. I've had to use violence a select few times in my life, and most of the time regretted it, even when three northern-variety, half-drunk rednecks tried to gay-bash me.  

I do NOT regret that one time with my father, because he had it coming for a long time.  My little brother later went on to break two of his ribs when he pushed my brother too far, and I'm damn proud of my brother for it.  Sometimes I wish I'd had the foresight to kick my father's ass worse and threaten to do something much more horrible to him if he ever laid a finger on my brother or me again, because he apparently went to hitting my brother more when he couldn't do it to me anymore.  I probably could have saved my brother a couple more years of abuse before he snapped too and he wouldn't have had to be pushed to that point.  Surprisingly, my dad seems to have learned his lesson because I heard through the grapevine that he went on to intervene in others' lives and calm things down when he saw them start getting out of hand with their kids and animals.  He never did that sort of thing before.

I also hung out with Quakers for a while and learned a lot about non-violence from them.  Though certain aspects of their philosophy I find incomprehensible or impractical in the world I live in, that doesn't mean they aren't good ideals to aspire to.  I learned similar lessons from the lady who taught me some of the martial arts stuff.  She was very clear in saying that we should avoid confrontation whenever possible and we were never to use the skills she was teaching on someone capriciously or without just cause.   I'd say my philosophy is a fusion of the two schools of thought.  Violence isn't the answer to most things, unless there is absolutely no other choice.  Sometimes the only way to get someone to back off and not harm you is to give them a black eye or two.  I've learned that, *""Speak softly but carry a big stick..""* has it's merits. 

I also am diagnosed with PTSD, due in no small part to the environment I was raised in.  I have to keep myself disciplined and under control, which takes a lot from my mental energy reserves, because I feel the same rage and impulsiveness that I was constantly exposed to and one of my biggest fears is that I'll lash out and harm someone, and I'm most worried that I'll do it to someone I care about.  It's not that I'm a ticking time bomb or anything like that.  I just have to be careful to avoid/deflect situations and people who are likely to light my fuse.  

Many of the people who used to bully me in school have reapproached me in our adult years and apologized for how they treated me in school, which was heart-warming and good of them.

I'm not hiding anything illegal or terribly interesting, but was raised with people who don't respect personal privacy and it has made me hyper-vigilant about it.  If I go on vacation with my family, I literally have to put padlocks on my bag zippers as well as my tent zippers because my mother will rifle through my things when I'm not there and that pisses me off, not least because she has been repeatedly confronted about it.  She wonders why she isn't terribly close with her kids but her lack of respect for privacy/personal possessions is a self-reinforcing negative feedback loop.  The more she snoops, the more her progeny lock everything up and withdraw from her socially.  She has been told about this problem repeatedly but refuses to change in any meaningful way.  My father doesn't have as much of a problem with this... his problems are more with social boundaries and embarrassing social behavior (trying to proselytize or shoehorn religious views into every conversation, being somewhat racist, etc.)  Both of my parents have always had a very poor sense of personal boundaries and it hasn't changed much as I've gotten older, so I have no choice but to protect my privacy using all available means when I'm around them.  They also used to routinely lend out their kids' possessions to other people or gave away things they didn't think mattered to us (they did) without asking, then we were accused of being selfish when we protested.  I blew a gasket on my mother two years ago when we were on a family vacation... I was going for a long hike, told them not to wait for me as I was uncertain when I'd be back.  Three hours later I was hiking down the road from the mountain and saw my mother and two of her friends, driving MY CAR looking for me, (mom doesn't drive, friends were driving it) despite the fact that her friends had a perfectly useable car of their own.  I had a raging borderline-meltdown right there... she actually took my keys and told her friends that it was OK to use my car.... that was by far the worst violation of personal boundaries lately...  Maybe folks reading this can understand why I guard my privacy viciously.

562,"I'm in my mid 30s and was diagnosed a few years ago.   It's neither here nor there at this point I guess.  There were a number of professionals in the school system urging my parents to get me screened for developmental problems some years ago, and my parents refused... for the wrong reasons but the net effect was probably positive compared to what it could have been.

With that said, I'm glad that at least now I know and now I have answers for why I didn't seem to fit into my environment terribly well and was always very different from many of the other kids.  It's kind of like being a cat that was raised as a dog, with dogs for it's whole life, sort of managing to loosely conform to pack behavior but never totally being a part of the pack or able to understand some aspects of their pack-mates' behavior,  and then one day that cat ends up wandering into a group of cats and is somehow able to realize that it is actually a cat, so to speak.

The only things which have changed are that I am now more selective and smarter about the company I keep and I have stopped trying to force myself to fit in with the standard neurotypical population. I take more time to be solitary and feed my head, which has helped with my emotional/mental well-being.  I don't begrudge neurotypicals (or other people who are otherwise not like me) their way of being and living and I enjoy hanging out with some of them, but I am distinctly different and at this point in life learning to be OK with that.

569,"Well, be cautious there... many types of pine needles have allelopathic (growth-inhibiting effects on other types of plants) compounds in them.  Make sure to do your research on that.  From what I know, regardless of what you use, if it has allelopathic compounds in it, should probably be composted for at least a good year or two and will usually be safe after that.  In the florida heat and rain, you should be able to compost wood bark/shavings/chips pretty quickly, particularly if you inoculate it with compost tea and take a leak on it now and then.  I'm way up in the north-east and it usually takes a couple years for it to totally break down into soil,  I figure down there it would take significantly less time.  You can often get them for free from landscaping services which chip their trimmings/cleared brush and/or pet stores cleaning out animal cages.  I work for a pet store and take home 2-3 55-gallon bags of pine shavings a week.

Then I rely on calculating how to deal with them where I reason my reactions to people based on what I know about them and what is commonly accepted as an appropriate reaction to them and what will be helpful or appropriate to their problem/situation/conundrum,  without actually feeling the ancillary emotions attached to all that.  I don't really have a choice in that sometimes.  The only choice is to allow myself to feel and become a train-wreck who is of no use to anyone, including myself, or put up a wall and act according to what some might consider a cold, mental algorithm, while still appearing to be caring and concerned.  Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm half-sociopath or something, but I also reason that I'm not a sociopath because I was at one time very concerned that I could be and then, realized that the fact that I was concerned about how that would affect the others in my life meant that I probably wasn't a sociopath, just a little fucked up/damaged.  :-P

That said, there are also some other aspies or at least aspie-types whom I get along well with because our sensitivities, interests, mindsets, and behaviors are more convergent.

589,"The public schools constantly tried to toss me into special ed because I was struggling hard, but many of my struggles were social, not intellectual.  I couldn't learn because I was undergoing constant anxiety from being bullied too much and the school administration was woefully incompetent when it came to dealing with bullying.  It's real hard to absorb knowledge when you are literally having to watch your back every minute you are in school. The principal's stock response to all forms of bullying not involving personal injury was, ""Sorry, nothing I can do about it, freedom of speech.""  He was an incompetent, uncaring uber-putz.  

Public special ed programs in my area at the time (early 90s) were also basically holding tanks for kids who were thought to be more or less hopeless as far as being fully functional members of society in the future. Whether or not special ed would have been good for me is heavily in question here.  I suspect I would not have thrived. My parents, for all their faults, at least cared about my education, refused to let me get tossed in there, and moved me to a private school, which was way better and easier to deal with.  Some bullying but nowhere near as much as in public school.  I graduated salutitorian of a small class, so it's not like I was super-smart among a large graduating class, but it's something.    With all that said, from what I've seen, special ed programs have come a long way since then and I would probably be less opposed to going into it these days if I were a struggling pre-teen.  There is also way more awareness and support for ASD-type conditions than there was when I was young.  Much probably depends on the individual school, the funding it gets, and the quality of the people staffing such programs.

Random fact: literally the year after I was moved out of public school, the local district superintendent saw how poor the poorly that school was performing and literally moved his office into that school so he could crack the whip hard over the incompetent principal.  At least some small measure of justice was enacted.  A pity it had to happen after I was gone from there.

It's best to try to just leave and avoid further confrontation if you can't summon local authorities in a timely fashion.  If something like this ever starts to happen again, it might be a good idea to try to video-record their behavior on a cellphone camera so you can show the cops what they were doing in case they try to lie about it.  It might also be a good idea to backup the video to a flashdrive or other media and leave it with a trusted friend/family member before you even contact authorities, just in case the cops or anyone involved in the resulting case happens to be corrupt and the evidence ends up conveniently 'lost'.   It's pretty damn hard to lie about what's clear on a video and, if you are in the U.S., in most places it's completely legal to record anything happening in a public space.  Privately owned spaces... it depends on local/state laws.   [Something like this](http://www.amazon.com/SpyCrushers-Spy-Pen-Camera-Guarantee/dp/B00J3CL3Q6) is also potentially very useful if you are wishing to record their behavior on the down-low without them knowing they are being recorded.   Just slip it into a breast-pocket on your shirt or into your shirt collar in such a way that the lens is facing outward and stand facing whatever incident is happening for long enough to capture whatever it is.

636,"Hey there, speaking as a guy who works with animals as part of his profession, have you considered possibly soaking the cards with a 1:1 solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide and water?  I'm not guaranteeing that it won't harm the cards in some way but it does a reasonably good job of sterilizing the surface and permanently killing the associated odor which comes with that kind of mess.  I've done this myself with similar objects when my own large dog decided to mark a box I forgot sitting on the ground for a few hours outdoors.

Again, I don't know how it will react with the cards as it may depend on the cards' manufacturer,  base material and the ink they are printed with.  At the very least, it may render them useable again, though it may destroy their trade/resale value if it eats off the finish, causes the card to warp/wrinkle, or shifts the colors in the ink.  You might want to test it on a few low-value cards before you try anything on a larger scale.  If this ends up working out for you and they are still in reasonably good shape with treatment, you can then sandwich them between two towels and two sheets of rigid cardboard/paperboard between a mattress and box spring, and leave them there a couple days so they can dry flat.   The towels may need to be changed out once and again between each batch you treat.

I could literally go online and be hooking up within 10 minutes, but I don't, just because [my wiring does not work that way.](https://www.asexuality.org/wiki/index.php?title=Demisexual)  I've been celibate for over three years and don't really feel like I'm missing much.  My best friend whom I hang with on a nearly daily basis was a former lover and we have been strictly platonic for over three years, not for lack of trying on his part.  That said,  don't value yourself based on sexual availability or the amount of people you've slept with or haven't.  Sexuality is a part of being human but it is not the whole or even a majority of it.  Whether I am being sexually active or not, it feels the same to me, but maybe it's different for others.  Sure, I'd like a healthy relationship again at some point, including the physical/sexual part of it, but I just haven't met anyone whom I have bonded with or feel that way about since my last relationship.  It's OK to not have sex and it doesn't have to be a part of your identity or a metric to value yourself by.

It can be difficult to determine the proper middle ground between too friendly and too aloof... even more complicated when you realize the same method doesn't work for everyone.  The best you can really do is shoot for a persona which manages to endear you to most people.  I don't think it's possible to have one which appeals to everyone.   

There isn't any big secret in my case,  it's just that I learned from a lot of the times I screwed up.  I also found it helpful to watch people who are socially adept, focused on the bits I figured were doable for me, compared it to my behavior, made modifications when  necessary, and pounded out a working social script from it by trial and error.   Practicing the required facial expressions,  body language, etc... in a mirror in private helped, but felt very awkward.  I still have to do this sometimes.  It still feels awkward.

677,"Good to hear that you are doing better OP, and that the community was a great help.  Feel free to keep swinging in and speaking your piece.  I remember finding this sub a few years ago after I was urged by a close family member to pursue diagnosis.  It was when the subscriber count was just below 2k, and I also recall enjoying how helpful and insightful the community was for me, and how it helped me feel like I wasn't alone and how relieved I felt that I wasn't the only one having these kinds of struggles which most others couldn't relate to.  How these things can all tie into and promote deep depression.  I also remember feeling a lot of relief in knowing that I'm not really broken, but was wasting a lot of energy applying myself to situations which were bad for me or at the very least counterproductive.  

Here's wishing you the best of luck from here on out and don't be a stranger.  One thing I found helped when I was at where you are now, was to prepare myself mentally, knowing that the laws of probability and how they relate to human relationships and situations... in some ways they assure that more bad things and/or complicated situations will land on your plate, but there will usually be a lot of good things to balance them out in the long run.  When bad times come, pull in, knuckle down, wait out the storm and take pride in all the other storms you outlasted so far.  You survived and defied all the other ones, the next one will not break you.  Keep looking for the good in others, carefully avoid the bad, understanding also that sometimes the bad requires you to meet it head on,  and stay connected to what inspires you. Not everything in life has or needs to have a complicated answer.  Be wary of over-thinking but strike a balance with your curiousity and allow yourself to explore other avenues.  Stay open to and make peace with the fact that the only consistent thing in life is often change.  Make peace with the fact that changes in life will come and they will require you to negotiate with yourself a lot. It's also OK to wander but try to stay grounded in something.  These all sounded like useless platitudes to me five years ago, but I've come to know the truth in them in the last few years.   ;-)",2016-05-04 14:38:24+00:00,d2sggqw,1.0,t3_4hsmxw,41271.0,aspergers

679,"It's not weird.  I've done the same thing with other types of wildlife.  Relatedly, last year my dog got ahold of a possum (and they are true to the common saying 'playing possum' BTW, thing appeared dead at first).  I ordered him to drop it immediately.  I went off and tethered my dog a fair distance away, then came back a few minutes later and saw it nosing around for bugs and whatever else it could eat on the ground.  I left it a handful of my dog's chicken treats by way of feeling bad my dog caught and worried it.   I walked away and it started eating the chicken treats.  

One other thing I'll say in defense of possums here, the whole rabies scare thingy persists, I believe, partly due to the fact that possums do not act like most other types of fuzzy animals their size.  They seem less afraid of people and animals.  In my experience they don't quite react the same way to the presence of large creatures, and they don't quite have the same personality as a large, fuzzy rodent, because they are not rodents, and many people think they are.  I have to wonder if the whole rabies scare thing with possums has something to do with the fact that they don't quite act 'normal' in the eyes of those who aren't familiar enough with them to judge their behavior.  They see several possums in their lifetime and they all seem to act 'weird' by an arbitrary standard of animal behavior, hence many of them must have rabies or something.  ...Speaking as a person with some stereotypical ASD traits, I can relate heavily to possums.",2016-05-04 14:13:40+00:00,d2sfg11,1.0,t3_4hug9o,2805.0,aspergers

Crawling over winding roots.

Brushing off the ticks.

Black dog always meandering in wide circles.  Ever vigilant, ever curious. 

Red squirrels wending their way up the trees like rollercoasters, to sound the alarm as we cut through and around the thickets, and glacial erratics left long ago by a receding ice cap.

When was the last set of feet traversing where I am?  Has anyone ever followed the exact same route ahead of my time?  Will someone else trace the same path after me?  

You are a young forest.  You are, in your own way, where I was, as I am, in my own way, where you will be.  If I did not visit you in the meantime, I would not recognize you in twenty years.  Though somewhere in me, I would remember the angle of every stone, curve, branch, and root I saw.  I would remember the way you made me feel most of all.  I would still feel and see echoes of what you were, as I imagine the many possibilities of what you will be.  Which of your trees will survive the years to come, to become the reigning presence and continuation of it's genetics?  

With or without me, you will build yourself.  You will persist.  You will play host to many millions of microdramas, macrodramas, and billions of chemical and energy transactions.  Other life will grow from you, with you, and surrender it's energy back to you.

Anyone who dares to show vulnerability and openness tends to get labeled as being weak.  What happens when you bottle up negative emotions for a long time with no healthy outlet?  From a psych perspective, nothing good.  Emotional control is a good thing within reason.

I love me some Chemical Brothers. Was just listening to them on my way home. [We Are The Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TF6_MhwZX8) is my favorite album so far... one of the very few albums I've ever listened to where I liked pretty much every song on the album... though Salmon Dance is lame AF.  That aside, it's my go-to album if I can't decide on what I want to listen to.  It's beat and general cadence is high enough that it keeps me motivated and moving when doing physically active stuff or doing manual labor, but I can also just zone out to it while being sedentary too.  I also enjoy having it in the background when I'm doing things requiring mental focus.  There are very few artists and forms of music which serve all three of those purposes for me.

My choice is either that or become a mentally ill, homeless train wreck as social services are very hard to access in my area, especially if you work for a living and take an income above an insanely low 'poverty'  amount.  My condition comes with some nice benefits, but also with a social and mental price.  I struggle hard with mental illness sometimes, and in lesser amounts nearly constantly, have even had suicidal ideations which I was on the verge of going through with.  I've seen some raw shit and experienced some raw shit, been through enough abuse of the sort which could put somd others in a padded cell.   It's the kind of memory which puts it's hooks deep into your soul, bones, and nervous system, so to speak, and wiggles now and then to remind you it's still there even when you are happy or at least trying to be.


Also with your first paragraph,  I suspect rigid black and white thinking as well as a lack of healthy social/home environment, which sadly many autistics have to deal with, may play a hand in development of that mindset.  I was of that subset at one time, but life, hardship, experience in closely observing people, and looking for the good in them while becoming more cautious to avoid the bad tends to reduce and open that sort of attitude as time passes;  at least it did in my case.

I work at a pet store and I take calls all the time where people are asking for parts or pads for fish tank filters and at least half the time I have to repeatedly ask for a brand name and model number... they initially start with a generic description of the filter which could apply to dozens or possibly over a hundred different types, all taking different parts... and they keep restarting their explanation of the filter while I keep asking for a name and model number.   Sometimes they get annoyed with us for not having universal parts and pads which fit all filters.... and somehow it's our fault that most models take proprietary parts and filter media.

The unit is just ordinary 1.5"" steel pipe capped off at one end and reduced to a 1/4"" I.D. elbow to serve as the nozzle at the other end.  I may create a larger unit down the road if I can get my hands on larger threaded steel piping of the proper size. 

I fill it up with chipped corn cob which I get for free from work, screw the end on, and stick it in the woodstove, after a few minutes, as the pipe heats up, it causes the biomass inside to heat up enough to start venting flammable gases out the end which combust inside the woodstove, thus heating it up more and accelerating the process. Twenty minutes later it is completely finished and no longer venting flammable gas, so I remove the unit with a pair of tongs and once it's cooled down, I have perfect biochar for enriching potting and garden soil.  

In the pictures... #1 is the unit with the cap off, filled up with chipped corn cob; #2 is the filled, assembled unit; #3 is what it looks like when it's venting enough flammable gases to make a respectable fireball inside my woodstove, #4 is how it appears when it's almost out of flammable gases; #5 is the finished product of this process, which is typically about half the volume of the original biomass.",2016-03-06 02:44:38+00:00,d0p6pp3,1.0,t3_495hom,135.0,Permaculture

1010,"&gt; Hell, she doesn't even want me speaking to ""sinners"".

I heavily identify with this too.  It wasn't so much my parents but the religious folks I went to school with (was an odd, private religious school) as well as the pastor of the school, who were constantly perpetuating this 'us versus them' mentality when it came to 'outsiders' aka those who didn't believe what we did.  As far as they were concerned 'those people' needed to be treated with caution and their lives and identities were intrinsically less valuable than one of a committed, conservative, Christian.   

It has taken me a long time to recover from the psychological damage of that kind of brainwashing, and I can't even claim that it's 100% dealt with yet.  I still sit on a lot of anger and frustration from being betrayed and ostracized by family members in the name of their religion.  My parents are still conservative Christians and, while I support their right to freedom to adhere to whatever philosophy or interpretation of meaning/life they choose, there is such a thing as taking one's ideology to an unhealthy level... and I think they may have even come up with entirely new and novel ways to take it to unhealthy levels. 

My emotionally and somewhat physically abusive father has a fantasy version of his parenting and his kids' upbringing set in his mind.  He pisses people off left and right, even those who believe the same things he does.  He's classic, textbook profile for mild-moderate Narcissistic Personality Disorder, has left a long line of shattered friendships, severed ties, and churches where he isn't particularly welcome or at least a significant portion of the congregation doesn't like him.  My poor mom who, while not totally innocent, is more or less just an accessory to him and she can't stand on her own apart from him or socially due to the years of being socially isolated and highly dependent within a weird religious microcosm which does not adhere to standard social mores of behavior.

It doesn't matter how nice and contrite-under-a-veil-of-condescension they are presenting as now, and I'll admit they've improved a lot in the way they relate to me and other family members, but they still refuse to talk about or specifically acknowledge what they did and their complete avoidance of the subject shows what kind of cowards they are and it lights one hell of a hard-to-control, angry fire in my mind, so to speak.

Something tells me you also have a pretty deep understanding of the types of scenarios I just talked about.

Those who didn't leave that type of cultish mindset now find themselves getting lonelier within in an increasingly shrinking social circle, are in the process of being progressively ostracized by most of the people they used to call friends and family and rightfully so.  There's only so much crazy bullshit a person can put up with before it damages their relationship with the perpetuator of said variety of crazy.  They have done it to themselves by being so ideologically rigid.

Me: ""Yes.""

Me: ""Again, yes.""

Them: ""You'd tell me if you weren't OK, right?""

Me (*sighing in an exasperated tone of voice*): ""YES, please stop asking me!!!""

Them: ""Is something bothering you?""

Me: ""Yes, people repeatedly asking me if I'm OK and not seeming to understand that Yes means yes means yes and there is no alternate way to interpret that.""

Them: ""Well there's no need to be rude/snippy.""

Me: ""Apparently there is because you don't understand what 'Yes' means unless I say it fifteen times in a progressively louder and more annoyed tone of voice.""

1023,"Speaking as a guy who has known a lot of southerners, understand that the culture up here is very different and we seem to have more introverted behaviors than in your section of the country.  Many (though not all) of us tend to view a lot of friendliness toward strangers as being condescending, sketchy, and/or possibly a tad lacking in intelligence.  It's nothing personal, that's just how it is here.  Often-times around here, if someone you don't know is being excessively friendly, it means they have some kind of angle they are playing and trying to take advantage of you for something.  We tend to be a bit more reserved and express that we like people in slightly different and more subtle ways. If we aren't smiling, it doesn't mean we aren't happy.  Some of us are legit bastards too.  

 Let me put it to you this way, from a local southern lady I know:

""When I moved up here from South Carolina, I went door-to-door and introduced myself to the neighbors who looked at me like I had two heads.  I thought people didn't like me because I was southern, but that wasn't it at all. Introducing yourself door-to-door is apparently rare up here.  I later found out that some of them did like me when I went through that nasty snow-storm which dropped over three feet and several of them came over and shovelled me out and I eventually got invited to people's houses for dinner and parties and forged friendships that way.  It just takes longer because people around here like to observe you for a while before they decide to approach you.  New England is the kind of place where you may not see or talk to your neighbor for weeks or months, but when an emergency happens they appear and are there for you.""*

Became way more socially accepted in my 20s when I became known for having a talent for throwing great parties, but got exhausted with that by my late 20s and kinda phased back to being a weirdo in my early 30s.  My earlier 20s were exhausting and mentally taxing because it was all an act and I realized that being more popular was not worth all the effort I was putting into it.  My circle of friends has shrunk a lot since then but I'm OK with that as I'm being way more authentic now and the smaller group of friends I have now are way more true and accept me as I am rather than the image I wished to project back then, plus I was friends with way more fake people back then.

1057,"Speaking as a gay guy, don't be too jealous.  What one sees in the media tends to be exceptional examples.  Inspirational, yes.  Realistic portrayal?  Maybe not so much for many of us.

 Over the arc of my own life, it wasn't too long ago that I was basically kicked out of my house when my hyper-religious parents found out that I'm gay.  To this day, they refuse to directly address the issue and whenever some fact which alludes to my sexuality (past boyfriends, dating, etc.) gets brought up around them, they act like a robot which was just handed a piece of information which overloads their system and they go through a blank-faced 'system reboot' before quickly shifting to another subject as if nobody said anything.  It doesn't even matter that the 'ex-gay' facility that my parents were involved with for years after severing our relationship and attempted to coerce me into going to.... has since shut down and apologized to all whose lives they damaged, admitting that what they were doing wasn't working and was doing way more harm than good.... none of that matters to my parents.  

For LGBTQ folks like me who suffer from having families which are weird microcosms of anachronistic values imposed by bronze-age sensibilities... that's the reality we deal with.  I had to leave home quick when I was in my late teens, then did everything I could to stay afloat afterwards.  If not for my sister and grandmother not being homophobic bigots, I honestly would have eaten a bullet a long time ago.   My family is and will continue to be permanently fractured because of fundamentalist religion which has convinced my parents to take an 'ostrich' approach where they bury their head in the sand despite life progressing and going on without them.

In contrast to your post, I am frequently jealous of those select few LGBTQ folks in my area who actually have supportive parents and families, who did not have to go through the struggles I went through and are openly accepted.  That will never be me and I can't even structure my future around that possibility.  I have to structure my life and future plans around not being closely involved with my parents life.  The portrayals of acceptance and family ties one sees in the media are not a widespread reality yet.  That could have been my future but it was all ripped away from me by fucked up, insecure, religious bigots long before I was even born.

Now, I'm not writing this as some kind of self-indulgent 'poor me' session and I'm not fishing for pity, because I don't want any.   I dealt with a lot of the issues around this matter long ago and walled them off so they can't go barrelling through my life like a freight train and generally wrecking shit, as they used to (yet they still pound on those walls now and then to remind me that they are there).  I'm just posing it as an example of an LGBTQ person for whom life has not been gentle and I was forced to adapt to the world through a lot of hard knocks, and the themes of my story are incredibly common throughout the rest of the LGBTQ community.  Heck, I had it EASY compared to some others.  If a minority of us either were born into a fortunate situation or struggled through and managed to have an ideal life, serving as an example and model for other families and couples, so be it and bless them, but their reality is not my reality, nor is it the reality of most other LGBTQ folks.  The media representations are basically extreme overcompensation and attempts to make social reparations toward an entire class of people who have been treated like absolute garbage for centuries.  It's nice and inspirational and all that, but it is NOT a reflection of reality for most of us.

It's not all or even a majority of them, but it's a significant enough minority that it causes a lot of problems.  It varies according to the facility and how good the administrators are at weeding out the bad ones who are causing trouble.  To be fair, there are a lot of awesome nurses out there too and I've worked with some of them.  The other problem is that it is very rare to find a nursing home or other similar facility which has long-term administrators who understand the business.  My impression is that a lot of facilities are run on a shoe-string budget on the very edge of what is technically legal as far as staffing, etc...  and administrators are basically hired as fall-guys for the next state inspection.  I worked for around a dozen different facilities under an agency and for three freelance and there was only one facility I encountered which had an administrator who had been there longer than three years.

By 'cognitive empathy' I mean that I relied on what I knew about people and how to interact with them instead of my feelings and it got me through, with some minor mistakes, but at least I didn't completely wreck my life by telling myself ,[""Fuck it all, I'm gonna do what I want and be as nasty/evil/sociopathic as I like.""](http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cartman.jpg)",2016-02-12 08:44:58+00:00,czx4f1l,1.0,t3_45ac2n,50531.0,aspergers
1087,"I more or less identify with most of what you have to say.  For me, #3 turned out to be a natural response to PTSD and having gone through a pretty extensive amount of emotional and physical abuse growing up and I'm learning to control it better... that part of me had never been let out until a few years ago when I reached a breaking point after an extensive run of bad treatment at work... On the upside: people learned that nice pushover had a really nasty, evil, vindictive side which you didn't want to get on the receiving end of, and it is in no way worth pushing him to that point. Now I get left alone and not harrassed or treated badly and the work environment has directly improved for everyone as a result of the confrontations I had with people when I was in that state of mind... because I had no fucks left to give at the time and told it like it was to pretty much everyone, hence 'clearing the air' so to speak.  

Now number 3 stays locked away in a box but I let him pop his head out now and then when certain people need reminding that I'm not going to take their shit or be their personal whipping boy/door-mat.  My coworkers and I understand each other better and get along much better than we used to.  It would be lovely if I never had to rely on him but he's a necessity for the world I exist in.  Sadly, sometimes you have to break out the social weapons and remind people that what they are attempting to do to you is not worth it.  Still, it's also not worth it to go too far with number 3, so work on making sure that number 3 has appropriate restriants.  I came right to the border of going too far,  and it could have cost me a lot if I hadn't had the self-awareness to reign him in when I did.

Number 2 I owe to being way too rigid in my rule-following and structured lifestyle growing up... much of which was forced on me, so it was a natural rebellion tendency...  He isn't present much these days as he has more or less run his course and I've become comfortable with indulging myself in healthier ways instead of keeping myself so repressed that I have a break-down when I can no longer stand it.

Number 1 is more or less my base setting, though I'm no longer a 'young adult' as it were... am in my mid 30s and have seasoned it with more socially acceptable personality traits as I've gotten older and taken some hard knocks.  The pedantry and argumentativeness is more under control now and I've found better outlets as well better forms of presentation for it as I've refined how I interact with the world around me.

My hair is wild and crazy... kinky and curly and it goes into a full Jew-fro if I don't tend to it (I'm not Jewish, that's just the term for afro-like hairstyles on caucasians if you aren't familiar with it).  One thing I've found works marvellously, and this is very controversial advice, but it worked well in my case... stop shampooing it regularly... It's OK to shower and use conditioner, but shampooing strips the oils and makes it frizzier.   I also found that by drying it to the point of being still a bit moist, then running my fingers through it vigorously in opposite directions, in all directions, close together, then arranging and gently patting it down by hand (instead of with a comb/brush) and letting it dry naturally in place... works great.

You also might want to have a hand-mirror on hand when in front of the bathroom mirror so you can examine how it looks from multiple angles as well as the back.  Experimenting with this can be awkward at first but as with anything else, practice makes perfect.

In most cases, when doing the above, your hair will be a little oily/greasy for a couple weeks or so but you gotta power through it and your body eventually adjusts and starts producing less oil on your scalp because it's not being constantly washed away with shampoo (though your body's reaction may not be the same as mine depending on your genetics, diet, environment, etc.)   Just washing it with conditioner still cleanses it well and washes away any excess detritus, dead skin cells, etc.  I use mostly the cheap suave coconut conditioner formulated for dry, frizzy hair but have also been impressed with the Dove brand for the same type of hair, yet can't justify the price because I suffer from a chronic condition known as cheapbastardism.  :-P",2016-02-10 14:51:01+00:00,czursug,3.0,t1_czulrki,17417.0,aspergers

1104,"^ Agreed on all of the above, though I never went to college.  I've hung out with stoners a lot over the years and they cover a wide spectrum of people like most others.  Most of them are very chill, accommodating, and non-judgemental.  I don't live in gang territory though, unless squirrels, deer, moose, bears, and coyotes qualify as such.  I also love cannabis but I have to be careful with it as I love it just a bit too much and addiction issues run in my family.   These days I only have it once in a while, and that's when I can get it.   Upside: helps me a lot with creative thinking, relaxing/takes out my anxiety issues, helps me be way more social, is the only thing which helps me get a full night's rest without feeling groggy and tweaked for 8-10 hours after I wake up.  Downside: fucks with my critical thinking, verbal expression and attention span, which was already meagre to begin with.

1110,"I've read in a few different articles about children from very neglectful and  bad situations being 'functionally autistic', but I'm not entirely sure what that means or if it's even a real thing, or just the closest convenient comparison so that people would understand the child's state of mind.  For me it begs questions on whether or not the child is legitimately autistic as a result of the situation, started out autistic and was not helped by their situation, had autistic tendencies which were magnified by their experiences, or is simply being treated as autistic because it's the best way that the professionals know how to address them while their underlying neurological makeup is heavily divergent from that of a person with actual autism.  Therefore, does 'functionally autistic' mean that they are literally autistic and should be labeled and treated as such?  

All of that is an extreme set of circumstances which probably does not apply to your situation OP or might apply only loosely as a comparison because, as far as I know, you aren't being abusive, you simply aren't a rich source of certain types of social training through no fault of your own, so please don't take the above questions/comparisons as an insult or assertion about your parenting.  

However, there is mounting evidence that autism-spectrum disorders have a genetic and/or epigenetic component.  I'll tell you that I'm Asperger's/HFA and there are a hell of a lot of people in my family who are as well, and similarly to you it has brought about a lot of questions about nature versus nurture, most of which probably won't be answered adequately unless I somehow come into a lot of money and am able to afford to have elective MRI scans of my brain and other more highly specialized psych examinations.

We're hashing the idea of post flairs in the mod chat.  We are not going to do username flairs because it was done in the past here and it resulted in diagnosis-status witch-hunts, gaslighting, insults, and other unfriendly behavior which is not appropriate in this community, mostly directed at the self-diagnosed as well as NT friends/advocates/folks who just swung in here to gain perspective and education.  One reality of this community is that there are a fair amount among us who are poor, don't have fancy health insurance plans or any form of adequate medical/psych coverage.... or simply can't afford it where they are, which is particularly a problem in the USA among several other places given the crazy expensive clusterfuck that is our health-care system.  It's not ethical or moral to deny people participating here just for being self-diagnosed, and many of those who are professionally diagnosed started out as self-diagnosed, myself included.

This is why we have welcomed the self-diagnosed and neurotypical folks here since I first started lurking several years ago.  We are a resource for understanding one's self and comparing notes with others about living with the condition.  If allowing non-autistic as well as self-diagnosed people here means there are some fakers in the midst, that's fine, because it's just as easy to lie about professional diagnosis as it is about self diagnosis and it's not our job to judge or police which are legit and which aren't.

I never really had one of the types of interactions OP is talking about until a few months ago.  The subject was brought up and one of my newer coworkers who didn't know me well yet suddenly launched into a diatribe about how 'those people' can't feel emotion and should be kept away from guns, are sociopaths, etc.   It had to be the highest amount of ignorance I've ever had poured into my ear in the shortest amount of time since my teen years.  I think she'd been glutting on stories of one of the mass-shooters who was possibly Asperger's in the news in the last few years and that was the only picture she had of the condition.

 I tried to interrupt her a couple times, let her drone on a bit, then forcibly interjected my views into the conversation, telling her that I am diagnosed with it and corrected all the bullshit she just spouted.  It was a teachable moment, still kinda shocking.  She clammed up really quickly and looked embarrassed as soon as I spoke up.  Not sure if I got through to her or scared her.  I'll take either result.  *evil laugh*  As far as I know, I can in fact have non-selfish, altruistic feelings, use fire-arms, and am not a danger to anyone unless they start being dangerous/threatening toward me first.

1269,"Hey there.  I actually do lighting installs where I work.  FYI... most of those replacement LEDs  require a bit of electrical jiggery-pokery where you will likely need to open up the unit,  disconnect the fluorescent ballast, and wire the lines straight through to the pin receptacles, positive and negative on opposite ends of the bulb in most cases.   Read the fine print on the bulb package to see if it's this type... and it likely is.  That said... I'm on the spectrum myself and I really like a lot of the new LEDs coming out.  Try to shoot for soft white around the 3,000-4,000 kelvin range with a CRI (color rating index) of at least 80 or more if possible.

1273,"Re: your title... not as often as I would like.

I have a love-hate relationship with winter.  While it's beautiful and brings out interesting lines, angles, sites, and a certain different type of beauty in the woods and landscapes surrounding my place (due to the loss of seasonal foliage during this time of year), I also dread it, especially in large amounts.  I also own and live in a drafty old cottage up in the hills in New Hampshire, and it was literally built (poorly) by drunken hillbillies in the 1930s and 40s and I heat my place exclusively with wood which I have harvested and processed myself... so it's a lot of work.  It's also not unusual for the temperature to dip to -20 - -30F during the coldest parts of winter in my area.  I also hate shoveling snow from my driveway and roofs (there are also two sheds and a wood-storage pavilion/overhang which need to have snow cleared off).     Also, winter driving around here utterly sucks, my town is slow to clear the roads... which is why I own an all-wheel-drive vehicle.  If snow could exist at a constant seventy degrees and fall everywhere except for on driveways, roads, roofs and vehicles, I'd feel a lot more appreciative of it. :-b

Last winter was particularly brutal.  We had a nearly endless chain of storms dropping 1/2 - 3 feet at a time, in rapid succession.  Going out just to grab firewood involved ten minutes of suiting up in many layers and trudging through waist and in some cases chest-deep snow just to be able to warm my house for a few hours.  Old Man Winter, Jack Frost, Princess Elsa, and her idiot snowman friend can all go fuck themselves!  :-b",2016-01-04 15:20:00+00:00,cylk71q,1.0,t3_3ze82z,18842.0,aspergers

I usually can't tell if someone is angry, sad, frustrated, depressed, traumatized, etc.... and if they are angry, whether or not they are angry with me or someone/something else.  Once I get to know someone for a while and can establish a behavioral baseline for them in my head, it gets easier, but I always have and probably always will utterly suck at interpreting negative emotions in strangers.  This is why I like dogs and cats,  their expression is generally unambiguous and you can tell how they feel by their pose, body language, and tails... kinda makes me wish people had tails and ears whose position articulates in relation to their mental state, that would make things so much easier to interpret.",2016-01-04 15:13:21+00:00,cyljzgz,2.0,t1_cyld8zi,21535.0,aspergers

I can generally maintain a good scripted personality as well as conduct myself well in social situations when I'm feeling good and on top of my game, but even if I'm a little bit worn out, sleep deprived, or otherwise stressed, much of the former goes straight out the window because I just don't have the energy to juggle behavioral filters, overwhelming sensory input, scripted personalities, literal/figurative interpretation, emotional interpretation, etc. all at once.

In my experience, narcissistic and/or sociopathic types of people seldom do the right thing simply because of it being the right thing... they don't really have much of a conscience or sense of empathy.  If one were to pull off this sort of thing in a public setting and/or in front of their parent(s)' friends or others whose social support the parent(s) value, the threat of losing social capital is a very real motivator for self-centered people to do the right thing, even if it's for selfish reasons.  I speak as someone who has had similar (though maybe less severe) dealings with my own parents, one of whom is pretty much a classic case of Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  But still, pulling this sort of thing is a bit of a risky gamble and I'd really only recommend it if one knows the person well enough that they can be reasonably assured of a positive outcome and has a fall-back plan in case it doesn't work out well.

1338,"I'm not really sure how interesting the story will be but here ya go.

Basically, there was a fuck-ton of parking out in back of their apartment building and they had to walk maybe 30 more feet to get to it than if they parked on the street.  None of them were disabled, just lazy as fuck.  The street itself was a single-lane, narrow back-street and parking was prohibited on the street.  They had taken to parking sorta half off the street on the land in front of apartment, which was not the same property as the one they occupied.  I had previously come to an agreement with my landlord (same one who went on to purchase the property the pigs lived in after they were evicted for non-payment, not that they couldn't afford rent, they dealt a fuckload of drugs and drew a healthy state check), that I could put in a flower garden there to make the place look nicer. He was of course thrilled that he had tenants willing to make the place look nicer because it was a bit of a trashy part of town.  He talked to them and their landlord at the time, asking them not to park there because it wasn't their property and they had plenty of parking behind their own building. 

 They kept doing it, I personally asked them not to about a week later and let them know I was putting in a garden where they were parking.  I put in the garden, invested around $90-$100 for nice garden plants, put in rockery, etc. then I came home one day and they had pulled up all the rockery and pushed it over to the fence and parked right on the flowers, having trampled most of them.   The next few weeks involved me repeatedly calling the cops who ticketed them several times for parking halfway into a one-lane street and ordered them to move their car to a parking spot, but they would go right back to doing what they were doing.  You would think the tickets would have been enough, but the handful of nails all over the ground and them getting two flat tires before they finally learned that it wasn't wise to park there... that's what it took to convince them to stop.  They and their friends then began tossing their trash all over my flower-bed and over the fence. I kept collecting and picking up all the trash over several weeks, then dumped it all over their front porch in front of their door.  The trash stopped getting tossed on my flowerbeds.

These people were a walking stereotype of white welfare trash who were so ignorant that they thought anyone telling them what to do was some kind of threat and didn't think they needed to follow rules.  Sadly, our taxes are probably paying for them and their children (late-teens/adults by now) to be in prison or juvie at this point.  The guy went on to father several more kids, mostly from separate mothers, because he's apparently never heard of using a rubber.  I feel like these people are the precursor to the movie 'Idiocracy'.  I do feel bad for the kids, barring some kind of miracle or extreme intervention, most of them are probably going to have a tough life involving a lot of jail time and other assorted hardship.",2015-12-20 12:12:46+00:00,cy5f2oj,4.0,t1_cy5e9u4,3781.0,AskReddit

I used to live next to an apartment full of people who fit the stereotype of welfare rats, had a bazillion kids, never supervised them properly, were usually inside their house either high or drunk as fuck while their kids ranging from 2-7yo were roaming around outside.  Despite repeated attempts to get them to actually parent and prevent their kids from entering my yard, where they would inevitably trample through my flowerbeds and wreck shit... one day I came home and there was a group of toddlers playing in the polluted ditch at the back of my yard while another one was squatting in the middle of my yard taking a shit.   I ended up calling the cops that time because it was clear neglect and I was fed up.  They sort of controlled them for a while then fell back into old habits and ended up getting evicted... I saw the apartment afterwards and it was horrific.  One room was piled floor-to-ceiling with bags of dirty diapers and there were fecal children's foot prints ON THE FUCKING CEILING! I try not to even imagine how that occurred.  The smell was, of course, horrid.  That wasn't the only set of run-ins I had with these neighbors but certainly the most memorable.

I also identify with the main character of the book [The Highest Tide](http://www.jimlynchbooks.com/the_highest_tide_113805.htm), Miles O'Malley.  It's never specifically stated that he has Asperger's but he is extremely aspergian in presentation within the story.  His perspective and life virtually mimics what mine was like in my teen years, just in a different setting.  I was always randomly hiding away somewhere building something, finding personal treasures, randomly bushwhacking through the swamps, woods, and in the mountains exploring off-trail, discovering things and seeing sights which very few other people have seen or known.

One of the more common ones I've run into is people who think that 'autistic' automatically = borderline vegetative, uncommunicative and/or severely intellectually impaired.   They don't understand anything about it being a spectrum.  The closer you are to the line which more or less defines the difference between NT and autistic, the more nitty-gritty and specific you have to be about how your are classified as being on the spectrum... basically, it's more of a pain in the ass to explain.  This is part of the reason why I am not totally open about being aspie and mostly only tell people on a need-to-know basis, like if my particular deficits are obviously gumming up communication with people and they need to know what I need more specifics on, or if they outright ask me something like ,""Why are you so strange?"" Yes, I've actually been asked that a few times.  We aren't the only ones who can be way too blunt I guess.  :-b",2015-11-17 14:36:20+00:00,cx3af5x,9.0,t1_cx362k3,12212.0,aspergers

More seriously though... I understand where you're coming from OP.  I was raised in a fairly sheltered religious environment and wasn't told much about human sexuality.  After leaving my parents' house, I did a hell of a lot of legitimately academic personal research on the wide array of things which people do to satisfy their mating instincts.  I'm particularly interested in the mental underpinnings, childhood experience, and psychological divergence which causes certain subgroups of people to develop obscure and powerful fetishes.  I don't really have any of these quirks myself except for a few mild and common ones I won't get into here, but the research I do on it is legitimately because I find it fascinating, not because I get my rocks off jerking it to really obscure fetish stuff or anything (by the same token, I don't really care if other people do as long as it doesn't involve children or anything else illegal).  Needless to say, I can't really discuss this with most other people or they think I'm weird and most would probably think I'm actually into it.   I will say though, that all the research I've done drastically changed my perspective on human sexuality since I was a teen (I was basically taught that the only form of sex which is completely acceptable is between 1 man and 1 woman within a religiously sanctioned, monogamous marriage.)  Now I'm all like,  ""Meh, whatever consenting adults decide to do with each other is OK by me.""... and I have an encyclopedic knowledge of most of the range of obscure human sexual behaviors which I can't really discuss in an academic context with most people, lol.",2015-11-17 06:23:30+00:00,cx31ezm,1.0,t3_3t16nn,51836.0,aspergers

1506,"Eh, I tend to present as NT with some odd, but manageable quirks in my professional life. Outside of work, I'm a bit weirder.  I chock it up to having gotten really good with the scripted personality thing.  When I was a kid, my behavior profile was classically autistic and I might have even been considered slightly further into the spectrum than 'very light' back then if I'd ever been fully, professionally diagnosed when I was young, but my parents were unwilling to go further with it despite the fact that I was obviously struggling hard to adapt despite my best efforts.  This might have been good or bad.  Upside: I eventually did adapt to act sort of 'normal'... whatever that is, but the underlying emotional-perception deficits, etc. are still there, just a tad less severe than they used to be as I've gotten better at interpreting emotions, etc.  

Also, back then, the public school system wanted to throw me into special ed and basically label me 'retarded' (yes, that was the technical term back then) and that probably would not have served me well because the special ed programs back then sucked, were basically a holding tank for kids with behavioral or cognitive deficits until they aged out of the system and got kicked out into the real world without being adequately prepared.  Being forced to adapt and try to keep pace with my classmates' social dynamics gave me a lot of tools I might not have gotten if I was tossed into special ed. Downside: I strongly suspect my parents didn't want to admit to themselves that their kid wasn't 'normal'.  I incurred a lot of emotional damage because I was forced to butcher large parts of myself to adapt.  I really only began understanding myself and how my head works in my late 20s/early 30s.  I sometimes wonder what life would have been like if I'd been given good resources for dealing with my wiring from a much earlier age.  But, as the saying goes, ""Hindsight is 20/20.""

In my case, my parents were informed by professionals from a very early age that I was pretty different and had some perception deficits, etc... but this was back in the days when autism stuff wasn't well-known-about and my parents refused to fully believe said professionals at the time, both to my advantage and detriment in various ways I guess.",2015-11-17 03:14:00+00:00,cx2vi2g,2.0,t1_cx2v9w7,359.0,aspergers

I approved your post(s) this time as a courtesy because you don't appear to be a troll and your post(s) seemed pertinent to this sub. Be advised that further spam-tagged posts by you will not be approved. Others can probably see this one now but be aware that all future postings to pretty much all subs from your current account are likely to be invisible to all but you and the mods until the mods manually approve it, assuming they check the spam-trap regularly.

Ghosting/Shadow-Banning: it's a mysterious Reddit thingy which often happens to spammers as well as those who use certain proxies, post from IP addresses which have been banned by Reddit itself, attempt to manipulate votes with alts, innocently post too many links from one website (which gets you flagged as a spammer) and/or post to controversial subs a lot which often makes you the target of blanket-downvoting/blanket-reporting brigades, Reddit's filtering algorithms can be unforgiving in this regard. This is why your posts are not getting voted up, nobody can see them. The only people who can see them are either you or the mods of the sub you are posting to. I originally noticed this when I saw your post caught in the spam-trap (which happens automatically for ghosted accounts on most subs).

You can appeal to the Reddit admins to have your account reinstated but it rarely works. A couple of my own past accounts got ghosted after I started posting in controversial subs (it has been suggested that this is due to collectives of trolls who report you for non-valid reasons and reddit's filtering algorithms are rather unforgiving if you end up being the target of unwarranted mass-reporting). Sign up with a new account and there's a good chance you'll be OK, but be aware that if you are posting from a banned IP address or a Reddit-wide banned IP range, manipulate votes with alts/sock accounts or submit a lot of links from the same website, you are likely to get ghosted again pretty quickly. As far ghosting in general, even if it happens unjustly, as far as I know there is not much which can be done about it.

1544,"&gt;""You're Too Normal To Have Asperger's"" 

Ugh, I've heard this or some variant of it way too many times both online and IRL.   If anyone actually lived in close proximity to me and saw my everyday life and was able to peek inside my head, see me as I was during my younger years, as well as talk to the psych professionals who diagnosed me as an adult, they'd understand.  This is very similar to the responses I've gotten from people about me being gay; that I don't act 'gay', whatever that is.  I live on my own way out in the woods and have an affinity for chainsaws, harvesting and processing my own firewood, hiking and many other activities considered 'butch' by gay-culture standards.  Regarding the aspie thing, people don't understand that my persona and mannerisms were adapted to my surroundings from a very young age in an environment where psych professionals were all deeply mistrusted within a very conservatively religious paradigm, and without allowing me adequate exposure to acclimate to the normal, 'real' world. 

I also had to deeply repress my sexuality until adulthood or else I would have been sent off to one of those brain-butcher/personality-butcher, religious, 'Ex-gay' institutions where they basically teach you how horrible and fucked up you are because you don't fit into their neat little categories of what a good Christian kid should be like.   I was forced into a box I was never meant for from a very early age and had to stay hidden and adapt the best I could on many fronts.  Most of my personal self-discovery and growth had to be put off until my 20s when I was out of the house and out from under the control of the cultish environment I was raised in.  

For both aspies and LGBTQ folks, I think much of the misunderstandings and common perceptions boil down to crass stereotypes and people valuing those stereotypes as some sort of absolute truth because it takes way more effort to understand people as individuals instead of sticking a label on them and expecting them to act in strict accordance with that label.  Most every subgroup of humanity does have people who are typical of the stereotypes, but they are usually a minority and the most noticeable so that is what people automatically identify the entire subgroup with.  There has been a lot of progress in recent years, but we humans have a long way to go when it comes to understanding the vast assortment of subspecies within our own species.

It can actually kill you if that happens.  This happened to my mother, though her reaction was only moderate because she was so far away and the smoke was dilute.  

Edit:  another possibility is to layer several feet of rich compostable stuff, thick and wide enough that it builds up a bunch of heat... enough to kill the poison ivy and/or it's seeds.   The best way to do this is to layer it thickly in the right ratios and cover it with a tarp if it's cool in your area right now.   Lift the tarp every few days and fluff it deeply with a pitchfork, making sure also that the moisture level is acceptable, watering it down if needed.   Throwing a few handfuls of half-finished compost and/or soil between layers and lightly watering it down between layers... is a good method for inoculating a pile with decomposing bacteria and getting it to break down real quick.  I'd recommend leaving it all in place for at least a year or two to insure that the urushiol (rash-causing compound) is broken down and harmless.

1597,"&gt;To some degree what I'm angling at is totally the Sir Didymus in me. At least ot suits me to day so for now. You know, (over)excitable, principled to the point of ostensible chivalry, but basically boldly charging into situations where he (not that I'm a boy, not sure why necessary to qualify this as am also not a puppet) is only going have a really bad time.

I think that's a trait that, if one has it, one generally learns to mitigate it appropriately as they get older, also assuming they are circumspect about the situations they've gotten themselves into.  I used to be the type to charge in and bust heads on others' behalf (not literally) because I was taken advantage of and bullied a lot when I was a kid because I was incredibly awkward, had a hard time with social cues and reading emotions, basically an undiagnosed aspie at the time.  I was also shorter and very awkward and chubby.  When I came into my body as an adult and got to be fairly large in what society considers 'the good way'.... taller, more muscle, etc.  it apparently made me more imposing.  Given my experiences, I developed a strong sense of justice for those who were being taken advantage of/bullied.  I realized later in life that some people actively invite both forms of attention, both the negative and those who would white-knight for them because they just plain enjoy it and have no interest in progressing to the point of being resistant to the bullies and negative attention in their lives.  I am now much better at judging the ones who are legit from the ones who aren't.  Some people are just drama-queens who intentionally put themselves in bad positions so they can cry victim for attention.  It took me over three decades but I finally caught on to how to recognize those types.  Now I don't go diving in on anyone's behalf unless I'm certain that they aren't attention-whores.  I also hate the threat of violent confrontation so I'm the guy who is more likely to try to talk people down and reason with them before I'd ever resort to getting into a fight with someone.  I did way too much fighting when I was younger and I hate what it did to my head.  Doesn't matter how 'right' one is, it still just didn't feel right to me.

Jareth could maybe keep the kid if he promised not to turn him into a goblin... I mean, let the kid grow up and decide for himself what he wants to be when he has an adult mind.

Pretty much that, yeah.

&gt;The whole gender non-binary folks can complicate things too

I never bothered to ask how they identified re: gender and orientation, but I have met a few women over the years who were very stereotypically masculine, tomboyish, assertive, smart and friendly... and I did feel little twinge of attraction.  ;-)  Though I'm not very attracted to stereotypically feminine gay guys.  I don't dislike them or generally think they are unattractive or anything, but they also don't get my juices flowing.  If I find them unattractive/unappealing, it's usually because they have a shitty personality (manipulative, bitchy, etc.) and not because of anything having to do with their aesthetics... though some of them really need to learn how to wear feminine clothing better and/or purchase sizes which accentuate their best features, lol.

Long story short, I took a bully's manipulative bullshit and turned it back around on him.   This method does not necessarily work with all people or with all environments so don't take it as boilerplate advice.  Also, the threat of legal action can be a great motivator in getting management to do the right thing.  One thing I did before what I mentioned in the comment I linked to, was 'confide' in a person whom I knew was a bit of a gossip-monger and had a loose tongue and would go straight to the boss about it (and told them to keep it a secret, which I knew they wouldn't)... told them that I was consulting a lawyer about potential actions I could take against the company for promoting a hostile work environment toward me. Many companies are extremely proactive about avoiding litigation because it can tarnish their public image.  Also, if you have an official ASD diagnosis and are open about it, you can play the discrimination card, but I only suggest doing so if there is pretty clear evidence of you being discriminated against because of your behavioral traits.  However, don't go balls-to-the-wall about it... as with any altercation/negative interaction, it's best to start with a light touch and ratchet up the rhetoric and threats gradually if they don't respond.  Again, this can backfire if the situation doesn't have the proper dynamics for it to work so it's best to be careful and fully weigh the environmental factors and various personalities in play within the situation before putting a plan like that into action.  

*edit:* It also helped that I had some really juicy dirt on said coworker.

1675,"I'm particularly sensitized to it because of the experiences I've had with being bullied and physically assaulted... and it put stuff in my head which should never have been there.  When I was a kid, and after a long run of bullying and physical assault against me in school, which authorities in the school did next to nothing about,  I started having fantasies about torturing animals and certain people... never acted on it, thankfully, but examining those horrible thoughts forced me to realize that this kind of stuff is NOT normal and was the result of how I was treated, which further forced me to deal with it and find outlets for that dark part of myself, outlets which did not involve harming other living things. 

What scares me most is thinking about the sort of person I could have become if I hadn't had those realizations earlier in life.  In a strange way, I feel happy to be so sensitized to that stuff now because it means I am still a whole human being and still trying to be a good person who does not want to harm anyone.  

I won't lie.   I still have a nasty, dark, angry, destructive part of myself which I have to work to maintain control of, but I find ways to siphon the energy away from that part and pour it into things which put good things into the world and good things into my life to strengthen and reinforce my better self and starve the bad parts of the energy they would need to break out and do harm.  You know, that whole [wolf you feed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BeWpUIQCQAAIqg-.png) metaphor and all that.

I feel strongly that there would be a lot less crime, mental illness and poverty in the world if people were prevented from falling into situations like the ones which almost turned me into a bad person.  Other people aren't so fortunate.  If not for a few, caring individuals who saw how badly I was hurting when I was younger, I would likely have caused a lot of harm to myself, my family and friends in various ways, and that would have been the worst part.

1712,"Assuming you may have it, FYI there is still a lot of old stigma floating around about Schizophrenia and the medications used to treat it... make sure you are armed with more modern knowledge.  There is much which has been learned about the condition in the last few decades and the newer medications and other treatments are far more effective and less problematic than the older ones, where they (older methods/meds) basically made you ultra-stoned and barely or non-functional most of the time.  Many of the newer ones allow far better mental functioning with a lot less side effects.  On top of that, don't be anxious or paranoid that you will be institutionalized.  The only people they tend to do that with (at least in the U.S.) on a long-term basis now are the ones who have shown a capacity to be dangerous to themselves and/or other people.  Schizophrenia is also a spectrum much like any other disorder.  I wish you the best of luck in getting your issues sorted out.  :-)  I've known quite a few very smart and worthy people with schizophrenia over the years, I even work with one currently.

1713,"This is pertinent.  I've found that a bad, toxic work environment makes it impossible to enjoy my job, even if the job itself is enjoyable.  It's not worth it to be around people who constantly stress you out and work against you.  We had major issues in the culture of my long-time (15+ years) workplace a few years ago and it took a lot of work on my part, but I went around behind the scenes working to expose the people who were causing problems and making it a difficult environment for everyone to work in.  It worked.  My workplace is a pleasant, friendly environment again. 

However, don't be under the illusion that this can happen for everyone.  Sometimes the best thing you can do is to learn when to cut your losses and leave because the toxicity is so deeply entrenched in the culture of a particular workplace that it isn't worth making yourself into a target by working to expose it.  I was a target for a while and it wasn't pleasant, but I'm damn stubborn and I don't back down, often to my advantage, sometimes to my detriment.  The only reason I was willing to stay and work on it was that I had been there a long time, had seen the place at it's best, had a deep understanding of all the environmental forces in play, and had the right connections and game-plan to help the change to happen.  Not everyone is armed with those kinds of tools. The analogy I like to think of is this: if there's a single room on fire and you are ready and willing to wield a fire extinguisher, it might be worth trying, but if the whole house is on fire and nobody else is willing or available to help put it out, just leave and let it burn down.

AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!  :-b

I have no advice for how to deal with your sister besides just simply putting it to her straight, how it wears you out, how you maybe need a different way to be social which is more structured, calm and planned and be prepared for dealing with what would seem to be the inevitable blowout from her.     

It took years of avoidance on my part for some of those closest to me to realize that I am not interested in highly social venues where I'm being forced to perform (scripted personality, etc.) and deal with a lot of unexpected people and interactions.  They realized that if they kept trying to do this, it just drove me further away from them and further into myself.  I do compromise and do it once in a while but not to the edge of my capacity like I used to have to do, which left me feeling wiped out and just plain not right for days.

It was like a mental vacation which helped me temporarily block out the depressive thought processes and allow me to recover and rediscover/reconnect with parts of me which had been shattered by the death of my partner.  He was a big fan of the books and I never understood why until I began reading them two years after his death.  

I also enjoyed the movies and felt that they held reasonably close to the books.  Have watched them all about 10 times.

I went on to consume many works, too numerous to name them all but I've consumed a lot by C.S. Lewis, John Irving, Dan Brown, Barbara Kingsolver, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell... last two authors not recommended if you are currently depressed or fragile.  I credit a lot of this reading with helping me to understand human nature and emotions much better than I used to.  Many of these delve deeply into characters, how their heads work, how life experiences affect people and drives their personalities in different directions, etc.  

I'll also toss out an honorable mention of [The Highest Tide](http://www.amazon.com/The-Highest-Tide-ebook/dp/B0045I6TPI) by Jim Lynch.  The main character/protagonist is exceedingly aspie in many ways and I identified with him heavily, particularly because his life and thought processes are very much like mine, only with seashore living instead of the rural woodland living of my formative years as the setting.

All that aside, best of luck to you OP.",2015-09-17 03:25:42+00:00,cv4biig,1.0,t3_3l7p95,26311.0,aspergers

1821,"Hoo-boy.  About 18 years ago, my 1st 'romantic' relationship which, in hindsight, wasn't a real relationship... was just some dude who was out of his element living in a northern state with no gay culture and was a bit desperate for sex, used me for that and allaying boredom, I was young and hot, also naive and wore rose-colored goggles.  He was a bodybuilder.  I wasn't thinking with my head, lol.  He turned out to be shallow and have a shitty personality.  He dumped me after 4 months when he found someone else more naive and got bored with me.  In hindsight, I regret the relationship but don't regret the wisdom I gained from it.  At least I learned a lot about fitness and proper form for weight-lifting and various exercises, which was of much benefit.

Roughly 16 or 17 years ago I had my first real relationship.  He was a guy I met over the internet from a gay chat room, back when those were a major tool for gay guys to find each other.  He was legitimately a nice guy, very sweet and caring, I suspect on the spectrum or at least very introverted and shy.  We had a half-year relationship but we have extremely different tastes, histories and perspectives in life and we just couldn't make it work long-term, got bored and frustrated with each other, agreed to a mutual, amicable break-up.  We stayed friends after breaking up.  A year later I hooked him up with one of my friends whom I thought was a steady and decent person, after a several-year relationship he turned out not to be, abandoned him with no explanation and moved to the other side of the country. I felt badly about it, didn't dream he was the sort of person to do that.  Regardless, I'm still friends with my first real bf/ex.  We chat on Facebook once in a while and meet up for lunch and a few beers once in a blue moon but have remained strictly platonic since our initial break-up.  He tells me he wishes we met at a different time in his life.  I'm not sure what that means or how to respond to it.  It sounds like he wants a second shot but I just don't feel that way about him.",2015-09-17 02:51:23+00:00,cv4aea1,1.0,t3_3l7hk3,27374.0,aspergers

1851,"The reasons I am in pain relate more to my family situation than my Asperger's/HFA... though that does play a part in it.   

I'm a gay guy who came from a fairly conservatively religious family.  My father was emotionally and somewhat physically abusive while my siblings and I were growing up, that's left it's mark.  I was the son who dragged them down with medical issues when I was younger, who was pretty effeminate and awkward growing up, he pretty much wanted a 'manly' kid who played sports, etc.  Fortunately for my little brother, at least he was more like that so he got a bit less of the abuse.  My father is almost a textbook case of Narcissistic Personality Disorder and it's affected all of us badly.  Sometimes he would act like a loving, caring father, other times he would act like a deranged tyrant who lashed out at anyone within range and had serious anger management issues.  He desperately wants to be perceived as a some kind of inspiring, intellectual, spiritual man and puts on a convincing facade for those in his church group and outside his family, but the rest of us have seen what he is really like when he's not throwing up a false front to impress people.  I also can't stand most of my parents friends either because a rather large portion of them are misogynistic, intellectually-stunted bigots who think that America should be a theocracy and the 'undesireable' people they don't want to deal with, people like me, should be pushed away into some unseen corner of society and not respected or dealt with fairly, while professing that they 'love' them and think that society refusing to adopt their preferred paradigm is persecution against their religion.  It's about 5,000 different kinds of fucked up.

 My parents basically kicked me out of their house when I was 19 after they found out I'm gay.  We were estranged for years.  We sort of came back to each other, but not all the way.  They pretend I don't exist or am not talking when I bring up anything even slightly related to my sexual orientation... romance, dating, past partners, gay friends, etc.  The only way I can be acceptable in their eyes is if I am celibate and alone for the rest of my life.  I lost a partner to brain cancer some years ago and I was once stupid enough to open up to them about it in a moment of vulnerability.  Their response was ,""Well, at least you have a dog now..."" as if that makes it better, then quickly dropped the conversation.  Most people can open up to their parents when they have a major trauma in their life. I can't, nor will I ever be stupid enough to do so in the future.  Their response tells you where their fucked up heads are at. I am also furious with them much of the time for how they treated my sister growing up and how they continue to treat her with passive-aggressive disrespect and refuse to be on her side because she didn't have the privelege of being born with a dick.  The girl is the brightest and best of my family and I am damn proud of her.  She's the only member of my family to have gone to college, Ivy-League, much of it on scholarships, which my parents attempted to discourage her from doing because she was supposed to marry fresh out of high school and have grandchildren for them who could be programmed to be good lil' soldiers for Jeezis.

My siblings are both cool with me. I love my parents but can't stand them in more than small doses.  I stay in their lives mostly for the sake of my siblings.  If it weren't for my siblings, I would probably have cut off all contact and gotten the hell away from them permanently years ago.  Having them in my life is stressful.  They choose to stay heavily entrenched in a bizarre, socially conservative religious culture which does not acknowledge any form of science, philosophy, psychology, real world ethics, etc. which does not directly support their religious views.  They think that praying and reading religious texts are a cure for every possible problem. They act like I'm an ungrateful child for not wanting to spend more time with them but why the hell would I be masochistic enough to want to spend lots of time with people who consider me a damaged and shameful person simply for seeking happiness with a person of my choosing, while actively attempt to deny large parts of my life and who I am?

I have fantasies of moving my siblings and I to another country or way across the U.S. to the west coast and never talking to my parents again.

All that said, I've been standing on my own outside their sphere of influence since my late teens and am OK with that.  I didn't have any choice but to be completely independent since I was kicked out.  I have my problems but I'm making it work and getting by, despite all the weight on my back, so to speak.",2015-09-08 15:21:24+00:00,cuuh9si,1.0,t3_3k37lo,8802.0,aspergers

1869,"I wouldn't be too worried about it.  I was raised to completely mistrust psych professionals by people with an agenda (replacing legit psych help with religion in order to force people to be dependent on said religion, hence, promote it further).  I mistrusted pretty much all psych doctors/therapists/counselors for years.  I finally started getting help for some of my issues and it was a good call.  It's OK to be a bit skeptical of professionals and seek other professional opinions if possible and feasible.  It's also OK to seek help elsewhere if you don't feel that they are evaluating you correctly or your doctor/patient relationship just isn't working out but I'd urge you to examine yourself and the professional as objectively and dispassionately as possible.  That aside, I'm of the opinion that it's better to seek harsh truths than pretty lies.  If you do happen to have some sort of mental disorder or different wiring, it's better to know about it so you can be conscious of it, which allows you to develop methods for dealing with it.  

You may just be over-thinking it all and have some sort of garden-variety anxiety issue.  However, if it is found that you do have *xyz* more serious disorder(s), you may feel like you are having some sort of existential crisis over it, as many people do.  This is normal and it will pass if you arm yourself with the right knowledge and resources.  It is better to consider these issues, take them in, understand them, and deal with them appropriately rather than attempt to surgically remove them from your psychological makeup or cut yourself off from them, so to speak, because it doesn't really work that way. Remember that brain wiring, disorders, traits, etc. are a small part of the big picture, they may be part of you but they are not all of you.  Some traits, disorders, etc. may have downsides, but many of them have upsides too.  Example: some of the most intelligent and good-hearted people I've known contend with things like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other things.",2015-09-06 15:38:16+00:00,cusix4t,1.0,t3_3jun98,11119.0,aspergers

Part of me wishes I was diagnosed at a much earlier age, there was a host of school officials aggressively encouraging my parents to get me further evaluated,  but the condition was poorly understood back when I was a kid during the 80s and it's likely that I would have been generically labelled 'retarded' in some way and herded off to the special-ed room where my chances of leading a successful life after graduation would likely have been obliterated as the special ed programs 20-30 years ago were pretty crappy in my area, was more or less a holding tank for problem kids nobody wanted to deal with until they aged out of the educational system.  Hence, my parents ignored all that and pushed me through, with a lot of problems, but I made it.   They more or less did the right thing for the time, but for the wrong reasons... it was mostly because they didn't trust anyone who wasn't speaking from a religious perspective.   My understanding is that special education programs have improved a lot since then,  so if I had a kid whom I suspected were on the spectrum, I'd probably encourage a thorough evaluation and appropriately modified educational program at their school given today's standards (at least for my area of the U.S.  I realize there are other areas with educational systems which are better or poorer for students with different brain wiring and learning styles... one would have to take local educational standards and practices into account).",2015-09-06 02:47:17+00:00,cus4le4,2.0,t1_cus06ms,9169.0,aspergers

In general, I think that professionally diagnosed (or even very carefully self-diagnosed... assuming the person is capable of being completely objective and very thorough) psych labels can be used as a guideline to understand people and their behavior more and give them a little more leeway than one normally would for those without said label.  But if you remove people's personal responsibility and personal agency because of a psych label, that reduces them to being an amoral animal who should probably be under close supervision and firm structure in their environment, and I just don't buy that except for cases where they have extremely pervasive disorders which legitimately mess them up so bad that they truly can't make decisions for themselves or be held responsible for their actions... their living arrangements to be decided by whether or not their actions endanger other people.

1907,"&gt; it's probably best to not tell many people. This is how your brain works and it really isn't anybody's business.

I pretty much agree with this.  In my experience, it's best only to tell people on a need-to-know basis when it's obvious that my deficits in perceiving emotional flavors in communication are degrading said communication and/or causing miscommunication.  And when I tell them, it's casual and I don't make a big deal of it.  I just politely ask them/tell them how to  be more clear with the particular type of communication I'm having problems with and a majority of people are accomodating.  Otherwise, I'm OK with not telling people and just letting them assume, rightly, that I'm a little strange.  In my experience, a majority of those who go around telling anyone or everyone are the fake 'Assburgers' who self-diagnose after taking some kind of terribly constructed fake online personality test and are trying to use it for special flower status a la Tumblrina culture.",2015-08-16 02:33:22+00:00,cu4heqf,2.0,t1_cu4d9re,8570.0,aspergers

1912,"Not trying to tell you what to do or how to think or how to mourn, just offering my perspective here.

I only go to funerals because it is expected of me.  If I cry at a funeral, it is usually not for the deceased, it is because I know that others around me, many of them people I care about on some level, are sad and hurting and I feel it powerfully... for them, not for the dead or for me.  If it wasn't a social expectation and if it wouldn't feel like an insult for others not to see me there, I wouldn't go to these things.  

I choose to honor departed friends and loved ones by not letting the story of their character and experiences die.  I relate their existence to others when pertinent.  If their grave is within convenient distance or if I'm passing by where they are buried, I make plantings of beautiful flowers on their graves and help keep their headstone clean.  

They may be gone but if they are someone I cared about, chances are they added some measure of good to the world and contributed to the progression and collective consciousness of society.  Some say that the last and final death of a person is when their name leaves a person's lips for the last time and when they are thought about for the last time.  The least anyone can do is keep their memory alive and relate that memory to others in whatever medium they choose.

If you feel like it, write about him.  Tell about how you felt connected to him.  Tell about what his life was like and what he accomplished.  Remember the lessons they taught you and pass them on to others so that they can benefit from the narrative of your loved one's life.  In my mind, that is the highest honor one can posthumously receive because, in a way, it means a part of them remains in the world and recombines with the collective consciousness of humanity to drive it toward whatever the future holds for our species, hopefully with just a bit more wisdom which this person's life has added to it all.  

Some contribute in great ways. Some contribute in smaller ways.  Some contribute in smaller ways which become bigger generations after they have passed and vice versa.  Some contribute in the form of being a cautionary tale for others to avoid the pitfalls that they fell into.  Be the continuation of their voice and legacy while casting your own into the mix.",2015-08-15 04:04:03+00:00,cu3lk5x,1.0,t3_3h11qg,22349.0,aspergers

I have found that, in general, stimulants have the opposite effect on me than what their effect would be on a person with more standard wiring.  They chill me out and help me focus.  I've tried a couple ADD meds courtesy of friends (variants of time-release ritalin) and they do what I just described.  I mostly rely on caffeine and vaping nicotine for similar effect.  My condolences on the weird medication sensitivities.  I have similar issues.  To get a prescription that works for me, I usually have to go through a rollercoaster of crazy with several others.

They can spread quite rapidly and easily, are ridiculously easy to grow if you keep them relatively weed-free.  They form new clusters of onions on the long stalks with the lighter tops you see.  If you come back and look at them in a week or two, you're likely to see a cluster of bulbs developing on them.  Once they are at least the size of marbles you can lop them off, take them home, break apart the individual bulbs and plant them just below soil level and they'll grow a whole lot more of them for you.  They are called a 'Walking Onion' because as the bulbs develop and get heavier, the stalk falls over and when the bulbs gain contact with the ground, they send down roots and form a new cluster and keep spreading that way, hence 'Walking'.  They are perennial in my area (Zone 5a) so are likely to be so in your area as well.",2015-08-07 23:15:56+00:00,ctvdfkq,1.0,t3_3g6fcp,5392.0,gardening

2023,"Indeed, and yes, there will be a lot of collateral damage (kids raised with methods, attitudes and training which harm them) before that kind of perception is thoroughly beaten back into the dumpster where it belongs.  As more is learned, social pressure will increase against those who aren't willing to do the right thing or have a proper understanding of their kids.  We're in the early phases right now.  In a few more generations it will be relegated to a very small group of nutjobs who ignore all science and evidence... still unfortunate if they have kids, but it will be much more rare than it used to be in our time.  Societies don't tend to right their wrongs overnight, it takes a long time. 

*Edit:* I've already lived through part of this process as a gay guy who's parents rejected large parts of me when I was in my late teens and basically drove me away... now they are finding that their weird little ideological religious bubble is getting smaller and smaller and they are going into old age realizing that they are getting lonely, were quite wrong about many things and more of their friends have gotten with the times, tossed away their own anti-gay attitudes and distanced themselves from my parents because of the borderline-fundamentalist attitude they insist on clinging to.  They are starting to slowly realize that the son they started driving away from them over a decade and a half ago, and the daughter they neglected and abused over two decades ago due to their heavy-handed, misogynist attitudes based in their religion... neither of us is as close to or supportive of them as they were hoping for.  Action-reaction.  It's an ugly and nasty process which harms many people, but it can lead to a greater good.  When I was first coming to terms with my sexuality, I was scared shitless and always having to watch my back.  The world has changed a lot since then even if a significant portion of my family has not.  I'm nowhere near as nervous about being attacked anymore and I don't have to hide who I am.  I've intentionally structured my life so that I don't have to depend on my parents for anything so they can't hold anything over my head to manipulate me. 

I think the same process is happening/will continue to happen for folks with ASD as more is learned.  There will still be some people who cling to outdated information which has been proven wrong, but that number will continue to shrink as more progress is made.

I try to give him a bit of leeway on that because he lost his father around age 10, didn't have much in the way of good male role models for him to pattern his behavior after, and went through some serious shit which definitely affected him badly.

I'm also diagnosed with PTSD.  When I'm feeling like I'm on top of things and not depressed, it's like I have an emotional firewall against those kinds of things and it isn't much of an issue, but when I'm feeling low that firewall pretty much disappears and it makes me feel very vulnerable and hyper-aware/hyper-analytical of the actions of those around me, am likely to default to feeling like most people are somehow jeering at me.  

I've come to realize that this usually isn't the case and I am perceiving these things through the lens of some fucked up experiences and I constantly have to remind myself that not all or even a majority of people are actually having a laugh at my expense or even noticing me beyond simply seeing that I am occupying space and time in their vicinity.

Same goes for a lot of the disability fakers in my area... people who claim debilitating injury at the doctor's office but are out racing around on ATVs and/or playing contact sports when not hobbling into the doctor's office with a well-studied and well-rehearsed set of physical behaviors consistent with the injury they are trying to claim they have.  I also have a friend who has lived in the area longer than me, knows almost everyone, works at one of the local high-traffic grocery stores and she has seen way more of that kind of nonsense than I have.",2015-07-23 01:48:25+00:00,ctcvace,4.0,t1_ctc8o4e,34312.0,newhampshire

Honestly, given the shitty school system I was in at the time, being diagnosed properly may not have been good for me because there wasn't adequate support for ASD stuff.   I'd likely have been herded off to the 'special ed' room, which was basically a holding cell where kids were not pushed to do anything or improve much while they waited out the time it took for them to become legal adults and they were then shoved out the door into the real world, utterly unprepared.

OP, I'd say you are more conscientious about not wasting food than most people so I wouldn't sweat it too much if I were you.  Also, squid or most any seafood dish tends to go bad quickly even if kept in the best storage conditions.

Fun-fact: if you have cooked food which is going to go bad soon, re-cooking it properly (even temperature of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit, for at least 15 minutes, more is probably better)  will reset the keeping/still-safe-to-eat time.

There's a precedent for that in my family also... we have a few 'mountain men' in the lineage, guys who eschewed standard village living back when America consisted of colonies and loosely established territories, choosing instead to live mostly off in the hills or in association with the native tribes (this used to be known as, ""going the way of the wild ones,"" in the older local vernacular).",2015-07-05 05:19:25+00:00,csslma1,4.0,t1_csserjl,18501.0,aspergers

2167,"I sucked with most abstract maths until after I graduated high school.  It took me two years to pass pre-algebra with a poor grade.  As it turns out it was likely because the various maths curricula my school was using were so incredibly dry and unhelpful that I couldn't learn much from them (i.e. *""blindly follow this formula for the correct result but we're not going to explain how said formula works*).  I discovered I was actually pretty good with maths, including more abstract ones, when helping friends' kids with homework in later years because the curriculum they were using gave solid examples of how the formulae worked, how they related to real-world situations and how to navigate them. The materials for the courses I was taking in high school were written by a very dry former air-force colonel with no imagination, no sense of humor, and apparently no need to delve deeply into the concepts he was trying to teach.  I am someone who absolutely can't blindly follow methods or rules until I understand how they work and it helps if they are broken down, explored and related to me in a way I can understand. 

I've always been pretty good with basic math functions in my head and can do a lot of things internally which most people need a calculator for.  I'm occasionally annoyed when people at work feel the need to double-check me with calculators or ask me to explain my formula, often being skeptical even after I've explained it because they were taught and choose to use some convoluted and needlessly long formula while all I'm doing is taking a few shortcuts and still coming up with the same result.",2015-07-03 14:44:14+00:00,csr0xmt,1.0,t3_3byccy,38021.0,aspergers

The rest of what you say, I completely identify with.  I used to live right next to a bunch of section 8 housing when I lived in Claremont and all I saw were a bunch of useless, ignorant, white-trash slobs who didn't want to work, sitting on their steps chain-smoking and getting plastered... just staring at me or other neighbors with dumb cow-eyes and gaping jaws like they never saw other people before....  while their litter of undisciplined brats,  which my taxes pay for them to keep popping out like they're coming off a factory assembly-line, fighting and generally acting like little shits out in the yard, trespassing on my property all the time.... always had to keep all my stuff bolted down or locked up in that neighborhood or it would get stolen, often vandalized. I had my windows shot out with BB-guns, flowerboxes stolen, garden plants trampled, etc.  There was a lot of drug activity too.  Never again will I live near that kind of housing.  This is why I bought a place way out in Cornish, with neighbours who actually work and maintain their own homesteads.  The welfare rats (as in the ones who can work and shouldn't be drawing a lot of support) add nothing of value to society and should be deported to work camps where they are forced to learn how to work, with consequences if they don't.  I strongly believe in helping out the less fortunate by giving them a hand up and comprehensive job training, but many of these people don't want a hand up, they just want someone to give them everything and offer nothing in return and they perpetuate that culture by having litter after litter of dumb little brats who will also be on the system for life.

I personally have two diagnosed disorders which should get me a decent amount of assistance but I power through it and don't even try to get help because I know I can work and support myself.

2228,"I hear you on all of that.  I tried having a couple casual flings over the years and they left me feeling more or less the same as what you described.  I think a lot of these types of issues are from being raised in a society which has been pretty lax on in-depth education about sex, but thanks to the internet and further study, that seems to be improving.  Basically, most of us (at least in the U.S. afaik) were just taught the mechanics of it and that's about it.  I was raised in an environment which basically taught that sex was only for married, strictly monogamous hetero couples and the woman was expected to put out every single time her husband wanted it and wasn't really supposed to enjoy it much and if she did, it was heavily implied that she was of inferior moral character and likely to be a whore.  I also turned out gay so you can imagine what all that did to my head.  I'm in my mid 30s and can honestly say that I only have started deeply enjoying and getting adventurous with sex in the last half decade or so, much of it because it took so long to deprogram from all the nutty pseudoeducation about it which was dumped into my head since a young age.

2237,"Do you feel like you have actually fallen in love with her yet?  I ask because some people have a hard time with sex if there isn't much romantic attraction and a feeling of having bonded closely, this is often known as being '[Demisexual](http://www.asexuality.org/wiki/index.php?title=Demisexual)'. This is more or less how my own libido works.  If I don't feel romantic and closely bonded to someone, I can still do it, but not with gusto, deep feelings, or much enjoyment on my part.  You also might be asexual. Both categories involve a spectrum like many other traits and there is nothing wrong with being either of those things.  It might also simply be due to you being young and inexperienced, that's OK too.  Everyone has to start somewhere and as I recall, I lost my virginity around age 19 as well.  Would probably have lost it sooner if not for a socially conservative upbringing which stigmatized sex and kinda made me neurotic about it for a while, which brings up another set of questions... tell us about the education you received and general attitude toward sex in the household you grew up in.

That aside, it's not a race and don't pressure yourself.   Do you have any fetishes or interests which get you in the mood?  Are you attracted to your own gender at all? Don't be afraid to experiment a bit if she is open to it and assuming you guys have discussed your boundaries on bedroom behavior.  Sex is like many other things, practice can improve your understanding, appreciation and technique.  Also, as another user in this thread said, don't over-think it, try to go more on instinct and just let it happen.

She deserves to be loved, supported, and understood by the entire family and I can only do so much because I'm a black sheep outsider too at this point (coming out gay in a socially conservative family tends to have that effect).",2015-06-21 15:07:24+00:00,csdty80,1.0,t3_3ai9hf,93817.0,aspergers

2277,"I know what you mean there... maybe slightly differently.  I used to work as a nurse's assistant, have witnessed many deaths, held people's hands as they drew their last breaths, several times, and death can be many things... it can be a final close to a lovely life and a beautiful affirmation of what they lived for, or it can be other things I won't get into here, I've seen some of the best and some which couldn't be described as a good way to go, but I can tell you that having seen so much of it, it changed me.   It doesn't necessarily matter if you are close to them or not, much depends on where you hold them in your mind, how you regard other life forms in general, and how you feel about the concept of death itself.  I don't have any deep words of wisdom on this because everyone deals with it differently, though some similarly for some.  I will say, though, that having been through and seen so much of it, I'm not afraid of it any more.  That's one of the major things which changes you on some fundamental levels.  When you come to accept it and sit with the concept of an end to a life, in a thoughtful, serious, and reverent mindset, it is an honor to those who experience it and it gets easier with time, at least for me.   

If you can define it and care to, I'll ask what it is about the situation with your boyfriend's uncle that you are feeling strangely or badly about?  Are there any angles of the situation which you don't understand?  Would you define it as a feeling-what-your-boyfriend-is-feeling-by-proxy sort of thing?",2015-06-21 07:08:24+00:00,csdmhwi,4.0,t1_csdl1ra,4867.0,aspergers
2278,"A good set of questions.  Also, changes in the social environment accompanying a time of loss can feel particularly destabilizing for certain types of children, possibly doubly so for aspie kids, particularly the type who rely heavily on routine and consistency.  Those conditions also seem like potential triggers. I remember that's how times of loss and bereavement felt for me within my family, but who knows what it really is?  I'd be interested to hear about OP's situation a few weeks and/or months down the road and hear about what they have learned in the process as well as whatever the potential triggering factors may have been.  Whatever the cause is, I feel very badly for OP and their kid.  That's a hell of a set of conditions to have to deal with and they sound like they are at their wits' end.",2015-06-21 05:09:04+00:00,csdk8yd,2.0,t1_csdg79f,9900.0,aspergers

2280,"I hear you loud and clear on that.  I used to be one of those people who couldn't say no to anyone or define and reinforce my personal boundaries clearly, possibly partially as a result of a sheltered upbringing with occasionally harsh and/or emotionally unstable parents.  I had to teach myself how to refuse unreasonable requests and keep manipulators and emotional vampires outside my boundaries.  Went through a lot of hard knocks and generally raw nerves in the process but I learned eventually. I didn't really get a handle on it until my late 20s/early 30s.",2015-06-21 02:54:43+00:00,csdh02a,2.0,t1_csdam08,14507.0,aspergers

I have certainly had a problem with it and had to inject an air of detachment and reservedness into my social behavior because some people were getting weirded out or misinterpreting interested intensity as romantic attraction, in some cases deflecting me as if I'd made an amorous advance... which confused the hell out of me... or reciprocating what they interpreted as a romantic attraction and then things get equally awkward and I feel like shit because I've unintentionally lead someone on.
