I've watched multiple family members as well as now-former friends get sucked into these things and I've watched as their personality is slowly lost to the inevitable accretion of the 'lifestyle' aspect of this new 'business' mindset they are trying to cultivate and are suddenly paying obscene amounts of money for what I basically think are brain-washing audio CDs which teach annoyingly obsessive business ideology.  After steeping in that stuff for long enough, they inevitably end up becoming a walking advertisement for their so-called 'business' and start scaring away friends and family members who are perplexed because they seem to have lost their loved one to a weird money/success cult which has a very low rate of long-term success for participants.   

As I get older, I find this whole thing psychologically fascinating as well as morally/ethically repugnant.  It's also personal for me because I toyed with the idea of getting into one of these when I was young and extremely naive, thought most businesses were turn-key and easy; probably would have done it too if I didn't have people looking out for me who clued me in on these scams.  

I noticed that several of the people in my circle who were hooked by this sort of thing were confirmed aspie or had heavy stereotypical aspie traits. They've all since left it behind and most don't even want to talk about it after the fact.  Yet I see a new wave of this sort of thing coming over some well-meaning but naive people in my friends list on facebook and all I can do is just facepalm, send them a link to websites which discuss the mechanics of these scams, and move on hoping that they are capable of critical thinking and good research.   

Over the years I've noticed that the people who are tied into this cult-like mind-set seem to target people who are young, vulnerable, and/or otherwise lonely for recruitment.  This really pisses me off because I was targeted and almost fell for it, also because some years ago, people whom I thought were my friends at one time tried to distract me and separate my little brother from me so they could give him a sales pitch for their business which insisted that my brother's plan for going to college/trade school was a stupid idea and that he could be making mountains of cash if he invested in and became a rep for their 'business' instead... at that point I grabbed my brother, GTFO and didn't contact them again.  Also a close family member got involved with several of these scams and lost a lot of the family's money because he's very aspieish with a dash of narcissism and willingly trusts anyone who shows excessive interest in him, including slick and disingenuous pyramid-scam reps.",aspergers,Discussion/Rant: Any of you get hooked by or have someone they know get hooked by a multi-level-marketing scam?,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/4nasdt/discussionrant_any_of_you_get_hooked_by_or_have/

It seems ... excessive.  What is the motivation behind doing this?  Is it for attention?  What do they feel they are accomplishing?   I mean, I understand doing it once in a while but there are a lot of people out there who seem just plain manic and obsessive about it.  The posts wouldn't really bother me if they had any substance but it's a bunch of mindless fluff which doesn't mean anything from where I stand and it's pushing down a whole lot of more serious, current, topical stuff happening in the fora.  I'm not looking for a solution here, I'm just trying to understand why people do this.

I'm talking about stuff like [this](http://i.imgur.com/rIxvxq0.jpg), like, what does it even represent... a fucking kitten, roses, and a horse at the beach which inexplicably has sunshine as well as a storm occurring and there are apparently stars in the clouds... why?  just why?  Hell, I'd even understand if it was derivative of some sort of fantasy genre tailored toward very little children but this appears to be derivative of a strange and saccharine-pickled mind.
