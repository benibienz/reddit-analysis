As a result they don't let me do shit, and I've been asking for work to do all week and they keep telling me to ask other people (and those other people tell me to ask other people, and so on). When they did give me work, it was either a stupid script or they didn't give me anything I needed, i.e. they asked me to fix one of their websites and didn't give me the source (nobody knew where it is).

Needless to say I'm not satisfied with the internship, and I wake up every morning depressed as hell to go sit in front of my computer for 8 hours doing nothing but annoying those ""geniuses"" with my existence and by asking them questions. They don't want interns, and I understand it's a hassle but they shouldn't have accepted me in the first place. So the bottom line is, I hate it and want to quit, but at the same time I need it for my resume.
