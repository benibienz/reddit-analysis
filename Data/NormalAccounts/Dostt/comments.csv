0,"&gt;Scylla is generally considered a fun character by those who play against her, while not being a huge offender in terms of frustration. 

  I'm sorry but WHAT?! She's one of the safest and most frustrating characters to play against, has one of the largest normal abilities in the game with her crush, and later in the game has an AOE cripple and root that punishes your teammates for even being in any sort of range near you, and deals shittons of damage alongside that. All on top of a CC immune ult that gives movement speed.  In almost every way she feels like a stronger, more viable version of Anubis.  and for a short time when you ""adjusted her damage"" she had higher scaling overall than him, that was much safer and in a single burst at a longer range.


You talk about how Anubis is doing ""well"" in casuals. but what I want to know, is what is the variance of players actually playing him compared to people playing Scylla? Because when you have a **much** smaller base of reference of course it's going to seem that they're doing ""well"". A Sample size of fifty is much different than a sample size of five hundred.

2,"I completely agree with this. The 3 pre-buff was absolutely awful to try and get away with, often times you'd just be better off running away instead of pressing the button 4 times in a row only to be stunned out of it each time, especially if you had higher ping. That being said, the damage to the 3 is honestly fine, and makes him more sustained bursty poke rather than straight up 0-100 burst now.",2016-09-22 01:42:36+00:00,d7wwf0s,1,t3_53wfwb,3306,Smite

8,"I believe she is currently available, It's just alot of the pros seem to think she's unviable, so they likely haven't wanted to try her yet, She's easily camped according to alot of them as well, though I disagree with that statement in my personal opinion. I think it's mostly just people don't want to take the risk of playing with her and losing because of it. She's very akin to Artemis though with the fact that she has low mobility and no real escape.",2016-04-18 18:40:03+00:00,d27u3n3,1,t3_4fdbf6,196,Smite
