1. The Road Not Taken
 
TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood,	
And sorry I could not travel both	
And be one traveler, long I stood	
And looked down one as far as I could	
To where it bent in the undergrowth;	      
 
Then took the other, as just as fair,	
And having perhaps the better claim,	
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;	
Though as for that the passing there	
Had worn them really about the same,	       
 
And both that morning equally lay	
In leaves no step had trodden black.	
Oh, I kept the first for another day!	
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,	
I doubted if I should ever come back.	       
 
I shall be telling this with a sigh	
Somewhere ages and ages hence:	
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—	
I took the one less traveled by,	
And that has made all the difference.",2016-11-15 11:47:14+00:00,da14ziq,1.0,t3_5d086u,31875.0,AskReddit

370,"I personally like this one better (not from a book though)

Have you ever seen the aftermath of a suicide bombing… I have. June 29, 2003. I was meeting two associates at the Marouche restaurant in Tel Aviv. As my car was pulling up, a 20-year-old Palestinian named Ghazi Safar entered the restaurant and detonated a vest wired with C4. The shock wave knocked me flat, blew out my eardrums. I couldn’t hear. The smoke… It was like being underwater. I went inside. A nightmare. Blood. Parts of people. You could tell where Safar was standing when the vest blew. It was like a perfect circle of death. There was almost nothing left of the people closest to him. 17 dead, 46 injured. Blown to pieces. The closer they were to the bomber, the more horrific the effect. That’s every suicide. Every single one. An act of terror perpetrated against everyone who’s ever known you… Everyone who’s ever loved you. The people closest to you… the ones who cherish you… are the ones who suffer the most pain, the most damage.

TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood,	
And sorry I could not travel both	
And be one traveler, long I stood	
And looked down one as far as I could	
To where it bent in the undergrowth;	        5
 
Then took the other, as just as fair,	
And having perhaps the better claim,	
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;	
Though as for that the passing there	
Had worn them really about the same,	        10
 
And both that morning equally lay	
In leaves no step had trodden black.	
Oh, I kept the first for another day!	
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,	
I doubted if I should ever come back.	        15
 
I shall be telling this with a sigh	
Somewhere ages and ages hence:	
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—	
I took the one less traveled by,	
And that has made all the difference.

She accepted and as soon as she did, i turned to her friend and kissed him (i asked first of course, like i did with everyone else) and then made out with some bearded man, while my roommate was standing there shocked, putting us both on 2. 44 minutes had passed and we both tied for kisses, both on 16 (she kissed more girls than boys and i am sure i broke even) and with a minute to go we are both desperately trying to find one more person to kiss. and i shouted to a random guy walking past if he would kiss me for the challenge.

Office properties have been added to GTA Online. Players can buy an Office via Dynasty 8 Real Estate or directly through the Dynasty 8 Executive websites after completing or skipping the GTA Online tutorial and can only own one Office at a time. Upon purchasing an Office, players will be given a CEO title and given access to exclusive privileges. Offices also give you access to the SecuroServ Special Cargo Network which allows you to start buying and selling Special Cargo. Offices are provided with an Executive Assistant and can be customized with additions such as décor, a gun locker, accommodations and a safe.

Warehouse properties have been added to GTA Online. Warehouses are used to store Special Cargo and at least one is required to new Special Cargo Missions. CEOs can buy a Warehouse via the SecuroServ Special Cargo Network. This can be accessed at the computer on the desk in the Office. Warehouses are used to store Special Cargo. Warehouses can be bought in 3 capacities, small, medium and large and players can own up to 5.
Players can now buy and sell Special Cargo via the new SecuroServ Special Cargo Network which is available at the desk computer in Offices while registered as a CEO. Once secured, CEOs can then choose to sell their Special Cargo or purchase even more to increase the potential return.

Players who become a CEO will have access to exclusive benefits. These benefits include:
The ability to become a CEO without any bank balance restrictions, time limits, or cooldowns.
Access to new and exclusive outfits for CEOs to dress their Organization with.

Access to new and exclusive CEO vehicles upon purchasing an Office and various sized Warehouses.
Players who become Associates of a CEO will also have access to exclusive benefits. These benefits include:
Bonus wages for each consecutive Special Cargo Mission completed by their CEO, up to a maximum of $10,000. 

Failing a Mission will reset wages to a default value.

Increased RP and 100% health regeneration when inside the radius of their CEO.

Three new VIP Works have been added. These include:
Headhunter (1+ Players) – Your Organization tries to take down multiple targets across the map against a time limit.

Airfreight (1+ Players) – Your Organization must collect a Cargobob and use it to extract to a drop-off point.

747,"I had a nice big family of 8, wanted to challenge myself to see how i would manage them all at once. so i built them a nice big house with the living room made of glass, so they could all see outside and it brought in a lot of natural lighting, little did i know, this is where i would create simulated emotional trauma.

After a while of playing my massive family, it got super hard making all the children go to school, all the adults go to work, so i did the only reasonable thing. I gathered the whole family in the living room, removed the doors, placed a whole lot of clutter and a fireplace, then i sat back and waited. The oldest one in the family died first in the fire, just as one of the children was burning to death, that's when i saw it. One of the children had made it outside of the house before i started the fire. So being the psychopath i am, i decided to just let him sit there, and he did. A small child watched (probably in horror) as his mother, father, grandfather, grandmother, two sisters and only brother burn to death in the fire.
So then i decided to continue his legacy. I let him live out his life, he moved out, i adopted him off to a single mother who had no children. He grew up happy, he found a wife, had twins. A boy and a girl. the foster mother was getting old, and to celebrate her final days, i made them have a nice party before removing the doors, and setting the place on fire again. The whole family perished, but i made sure to remove the original fire survivor from the house to to make him watch his family burn to death for a second time.

I haven't gone back to check on him after that.

- Rimworld (you manage a small colony and have to keep them all alive to escape the planet) (it gets hard some times)
- FTL: Faster Than Light (Manage a space ship and crew to defeat bigger and bigger ships along the way)
- Prison Architect (manage a prison, all the staff and prisoners) (very similar gameplay to Rimworld)
