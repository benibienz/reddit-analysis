1,"This specific part took about a four hour session, I decided not to stray from the road that the DM was paving for me too much and just went along with it. I've actually been playing for quite a while, but decided not to write it down since at the time it didn't make sense to, the common orc rarely learns to read and write in his homeland.",2016-10-01 12:14:28+00:00,d89hczd,,t1_d88u7gt,,DnD

4,"The point of this post wasn't to yell ""skye is op, nerf!"" but to spitball ideas on how she could be improved to make her less toxic to the game. There is a reason people say she's op and needs a nerf, it's because it's not fun being on the receiving end of an ability that can kill your team if they don't know how to deal with her. I'm one of those people who disagree on the OP part, she may be fine but I still don't think of it as fun, I have no idea how to deal with her.

I would much prefer a high skill ceiling champion with a lot of power instead of a champion that anyone can just pick up and use to dominate in the low levels.",2016-09-30 12:55:43+00:00,d8880d6,2.0,t1_d885c2i,6391.0,Paladins

22,"On the other side of the spectrum. I've had a great experience playing hero league instead of just QM, went from unranked to rank 10 and am still climbing steady with a high winrate. I've seen a total of two ragers in the ~30 games I've played and we even won both of those. 

Before playing hero league I didn't have enough heroes and had to play QM. That was a horrible experience, I had to resort to playing vs AI to get any quests done without getting frustrated. I actually went on a two week loss streak (playing around three games every day). The enemy team did feel stacked against mine and the people there would get mad over the simplest, most logical calls when they didn't feel like cooperating.

I think hero league is fine as it is right now, but then again I haven't experienced the losses to tilt me yet.",2015-11-05 06:48:22+00:00,cwp5s5y,1.0,t3_3riul9,44389.0,heroesofthestorm
