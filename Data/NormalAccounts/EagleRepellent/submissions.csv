 That feels like a lot to me when I look at it on paper. But while we're playing, he just doesn't feel like the hulking mountain of muscles that the character sheet shows.
 
I've heard people say that an ability score of 10 is basically a farmer boy, that makes sense to me. But just how much stronger is 23 str vs 10.

 How do you handle it? Do you make it meaningful, is the character physically massive, or does the character just exhibit his strength when it's needed?",DnD,How do you(dms) deal with a high strength score?,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/582giv/how_do_youdms_deal_with_a_high_strength_score/

Me and my GM never liked the idea of simply picking a background and meeting the party so we decided to actually play from the start and truly flesh out the backstory in a way that it would truly have meaning to me and my character. 

Keep in mind that English isn't my first language and that this is my first time writing a story (I'm also recalling this from about 4 months ago so some detail might be missing)

 So without further ado I present to you what I believe to be some of the best roleplay that I've experienced.

-----------------------------------------------
Orak'dal was born in Boldbridge at an unspecified time near the end the reign of Dyren Mori. His mother is Mazoghul who was a builder last he saw her. His father is unknown. Orak'dal is 2 meters and 15 CM tall, as tall as they come.


Growing up in Boldbridge made the young orc tough as nails, he also appeared to have a keener mind than most of his peers. His best friends who he had retained since childhood are known as Nose and Rock, a sorcerer and a brawler. Orak'dal was given the nickname Spike. While Rock is a simple orc who loves collecting pretty stones (hence the nickname) and Nose, along with his sisters displays magical aptitude. Spike considered himself a plain orc, perhaps only smarter than most. Rock is 25 while Nose and Spike are both 23 years old, not that age and time are important to orcs.


Their adventure together began when they came of age and it was time for them to embark on their first raid on the country across the eastern sea. The things he took from home were three nails that were forged by his mother, he could have taken a dagger but since they were going to be issued a weapon he decided against it.


They all tasted something sweet for the first time in their lives when they made land and found many edible, slightly fuzzy fruit. After a few days of travel while enjoying the fruits of this new and strange land they had reached their destination. When night fell the orcs made their move and charged for the walls of the city.

 The three friends along with the other rookies were going to be used for cannon fodder while the veterans attacked from the side. Spike and Nose figured that they wouldn't be winning that battle. Nose did his best to keep all three of them alive, paralyzing both Spike and Rock and hiding them in piles of corpses. When Spike came to, he was beat pretty badly, had many wounds that would later come to adorn his body as scars.

But right now he was alone and badly hurt, no living soul in sight except a few vultures. He could barely move. After laying in the mud for a few minutes he heard voices nearby. Not orc voices, the pitch was the same as the fighters from the battle.

Spike tried to stealthily crawl his way to the edge of the nearby forest to find some cover and maybe find something to bandage his wounds with on his way there.

The voices were coming closer, he couldn't understand what they were saying but he heard the sound of a spear piercing some armor and then the dying groan of an orc.

The voices suddenly became agitated and as he looked behind him he saw a group of six dark-skinned men. Three were wearing chainmail, helmets and were pointing his spears at him. Two were wearing plain clothing, one had his bow drawn and an arrow aimed at Spike, the other had no weapon save for a dagger on his belt. The last man was wearing robes that were gray from wear and tear, sandals and a funny hat.

Spike stood up, using up most of his strength in the process. The man with the funny hat yelled some orders and the three spearmen moved closer. They were taking stabs at him but not to kill. Spike's leg was hurt badly and he couldn't move much. He managed to grab a spear and wrestle it from a spearman, unfortunately the spear fell to the ground and any attempt to pick it up was thwarted by a stab towards his hand. 

The man in charge yelled orders again and suddenly the air was filled with pleasant sounds as one of the group was playing a flute. Spike was feeling drowsy and his eyes started to shut ever so slowly. As spike was about to fall over, he put too much pressure on his broken leg and the pain brought him back to reality for a second. He smacked his ears as hard as he could to deafen himself to the music and stared the group down. 

Again, orders from the man in charge. The third spearman had retrieved his spear and they had Spike surrounded. One started to harass his broken leg to make him lose his balance while the others did the same with his other leg.

The pain, the stress and the confusion was too much to bear and all that spike wanted at that moment was to die in glory and to inflict a lot of pain on that short sweaty man that was poking his hurt leg. Suddenly Spike felt a surge of strength in his spine, grabbed the spear that was coming at his broken leg yet again and pulled it past his side, pulling the spearman towards him. His strength had manifested in more than just a second of supernatural strength. His hands were no longer his own, instead of his slightly stubby fingers he saw claws, ready to rend a hole in that little man. In a fit of rage he threw himself a the spearman, tearing a hole in his armor, his skin and then his innards. All that Spike could feel during that time was his soul burning brighter and hotter than anything he had ever felt before and then, nothing.

I'm currently making a character who I intend to conquer a large part of my DM's world with. The DM is absolutely willing to let me do so. And I'm going to roleplay the character starting from level 1 to build up a story. We figured that at one point (since I'm not the only player who's playing in the world) other players would inadvertently hear of a war going on, and would be given the option to either help my character or try to stop him(or just pass on by).


The character I've chosen is to be an orc bloodrager (with int 14) in a [legitimate orc country](http://imgur.com/NWJgrve) (the highlighted area). [There are three cities](http://imgur.com/8z1Xwmo), two of which are governed by the king's subordinates. To become the orc king (or a governor  of a town) you must challenge the current king (or governor) and beat him in single combat. So far the current king Dyren (he's dumb as a rock, if you'd point to the sky and yell ""Look at that, a pig's flying!"" he's turn and look) has been in over one hundred duels and won every single one. The area is a mostly a rocky plain with very few (and I mean VERY few) forests remaining.

To the north we have the elven country (my goal to conquer) part of which (about half)  they conquered from the gnomes. The elven country has been falling apart ever since king Cales took the throne and all races but elves are persecuted (they're douchebags to everyone). The elven country doesn't use their natural resources since it goes against the will of the king (no hunting, no forestry, no gathering, food is distributed in cities for coupons)  and most of them live in poverty. Many are against the king but dare not show it since that would mean most certain death. 

Edit: [A map that shows the climate zones](http://imgur.com/LXKCBEz)

Edit: I will be playing a one on one campaign with the DM unless some other players in the world come up to stop me.
***
What I've come to you for /r/DnD is to ask for help building my character, strategically sound ideas, good discussion and everything that would make the game more enjoyable.
****
 My character's motivation to take the king's place is to save his species from running itself into the ground even more and becoming extinct.

* How can I make sure that my PC can hold his own against against an adventuring party of up to four characters? (How would you as the DM make a character like that?)

* What should I consider when attempting to cross the mountains and how would a true leader handle things like his troops dying of malnutrition?

* Is there anything I can do before the the first session to ensure a decent start for my character, do I attempt to make a guild of sorts to gather resources and find someone trustworthy?

* We'll be playing in pathfinder since that's what we've been using for the last four years and that's the edition that the world is built on.

* The character is to be an orc, using [this](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc) as a base.

* He will be a[ bloodrager](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager)(unless someone suggests something more fitting).

* Thinking about using the [Abyssal](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager/bloodrager-bloodlines/paizo---bloodrager-bloodlines/abyssal) bloodline.
* [Orc country with a grid](http://imgur.com/CW5w5Yb) (every square is 10km/10km). There are many abandoned towns which are not placed upon the map since they were abandoned when the resources around them ran out.

Recently I've begun having this issue where I lose the ability to right click. Sometimes when I spam my right click, it will lock down my right mouse and I can't control my hero during this time. A few seconds later it will unfreeze the mouse and I can continue on. 

It's more or less gamebreaking for me, I can't do HL without the fear that I'll lose control at a crucial moment and lose the game because of it.


I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddun9389HVU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=12) that shows what bug I'm experiencing although the clip is from League of Legends
