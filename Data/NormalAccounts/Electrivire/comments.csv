76,"&gt;&gt;So your fallback is an inexperienced

Stein IS inexperienced, but she won't win so I don't view that as a big deal. 

&gt;&gt;anti-GMO

She is, unfortunately, anti-GMO and that's shitty, but I could list off a few policies of Clinton that I find much more disturbing. 

&gt;&gt;anti-nuclear

She is anti-nuclear which I don't agree with, but am not totally concerned about, as her main focus is clean energy which I support. 

&gt;&gt;anti-wifi

She is not anti-wifi. She uses wifi and as she made clear [here](https://youtu.be/eiu3oT2-Eng?t=29m30s) is around it all the time. She is also not worried about the possible effects of it on adults but rather on young children. This isn't that big of a deal. I don't see any evidence of it being a problem, but there isn't really any research on it since very few generations have been subjected to it at a young age. She simply want's to make sure. 

&gt;&gt;fringe candidate

She is a fringe candiate but I don't think the same way about the Green party or at least its platform. 

&gt;&gt;with anti-vaxxer sympathies 

She is not anti-vax and as [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/is-green-party-candidate-jill-stein-anti-vaccine/) said ""She praised vaccines' ""huge contribution to public health"" while tacitly criticizing mandatory vaccination policies and U.S. regulatory agencies""

&gt;&gt;when even Sanders is stumping for Clinton now?

Also, Sanders is only supporting Clinton because of the danger that Trump threats. He has said that in nearly every defense of Clinton and it's telling. 

He has said in the past that votes for third party candidates are not spoiler votes or wasted votes and that you should indeed vote for third party candidates if they are the better option.

&gt; Scholarly opinion is beyond Jesus' existence being merely plausible, scholarly opinion posits that his existence is highly likely.

I have not seen anything that would lead to ""highly likely"" being the final conclusion, while I have seen writings that lead to a ""plausible"" conclusion.

171,"&gt;yes it is a fine analogy

It's really not at all. 

&gt; Scholarly opinion is in favor of him having existed based on evidence collected

No, there is not ""evidence"" there are writing of a couple different people that lead scholars to see the existence of Jesus to be plausible. That is different. You should read what they have found and tell me if you would believe in someone or something else given the same circumstance of ""evidence"" found.

&gt;Well, no, that's not entirely true.

Show me the difference in evidence found for both men if you feel that way.

&gt;How people will act based on this or that is neither here nor there.

This is another place we disagree. If people are basing their whole lives on the existence of someone or something, then there should be irrefutable proof of their/its existence.

No, they don't and you cannot prove that which is why you don't intend too.

As far as asking for irrefutable proof in this instance, it is warranted because of the massive following that said person has amassed. 

If people are going to be basing their whole lives around a person there should be irrefutable proof that they existed.

176,"&gt;When you simply assume that any version of Jesus is fictional, you are just arguing on your own opinion.

No. I have reasoned that the Christ is fictional and from that have hypothesized that a Man named Jesus likely was fictional for some, but not all, of the same reasons that the Christ is fictional.

&gt;You simply don't like the evidence or find it convincing.

Correct I do not find the evidence of a man named jesus existing to be convincing. And again there is no evidence that the Christ existed. 

&gt;There is more evidence for Jesus than Socrates. 

And as i've said in this thread, that is irrelevent. There could be more evidence of Santa Claus than the Easter Bunny, but that still doesn't mean either of them exist.

And also, Socrates existing doesn't affect my life currently or anyone else's. Jesus existing or not DOES. That is why the evidence should be more substantial. 

&gt;Things one can place the subjective moniker of ""extraordinary"" on do not suddenly need to exhibit proof beyond what would normally suffice as proof without it.

177,"&gt;&gt;It's kind of far stretched to think that a lot of Jews from that time would start believing the Messiah had come if there had not been a person they had believed to be the Messiah.

That's funny because there are numerous stories of others that are very similar or almost exactly the same as the story of Jesus. 

Here are some examples. 

1.Horus: (Egyptian God) (3100 B.C.)

&gt;He had 12 disciples.

&gt;One was born of a virgin in a cave.

&gt;Like Jesus, his birth was announced via a star.

&gt;And three wise men showed up!

&gt;He was baptized when he was 30 by Anup the Baptizer.

&gt;He rose a guy from the dead and walked on water.

&gt;Lastly, he was crucified, buried like Jesus in a tomb, and resurrected.

2.Buddha: (563 B.C.)

&gt;Healed the sick

&gt;Walked on water.

&gt;Fed 500 men from one basket of cakes.

&gt;Taught a lot of the same things Jesus taught, including equality for all.

&gt;He spent three days in jail.

&gt;Was resurrected when he died.

3.Mithra (Zoroastrian deity) (2000 B.C.)

&gt;Virginal birth on December 25th.

&gt;Swaddled and laid in a manger.

&gt;Tended by shepherds in the manger.

&gt;He had 12 companions (or disciples).

&gt;Performed miracles.

&gt;Gave his own life to save the world.

&gt;Dead for three days, then resurrected.

&gt;Called “the Way, the Truth and the Light.”

&gt;Has his own version of a Eucharistic-style “Lord’s supper.”

4.Krishna (Hindu God) (around 3000 B.C.)

&gt;Born after his mom was impregnated by a God.

&gt;Angels, wise men and shepherds were at his birth.

&gt;Guess what gifts they gave him? Gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

&gt;A jealous bad guy ordered the slaughter of all newborns, just as happened with Jesus.

&gt;Baptized in a river.

&gt;Performed miracles, including raising the dead and healing the deaf and blind.

&gt;Rose from the dead to ascend to heaven.

&gt;Is expected to return to earth someday to fight the “Prince of Evil.”

5.Osiris (Son of Egyptian god)(around 2500 B.C.)

&gt;Killed and the resurrected after three days in hell. 

&gt;Performed miracles

&gt;Had 12 disciples.

&gt;Taught rebirth through water baptism.


In case you couldn't tell. These all came well before Jesus. They are all stories made up by humans and so is that of the Christ and possibly even the man Jesus. 

And to answer the question of why it was ""so popular"". There is a reason to believe it wasn't at first. It was forced upon the people by Constantine and anyone that did not accept it would be excommunicated or killed.

Not to mention that if a historical Jesus was proven and a magical Jesus was disproven simultaneously people would still believe the fairy tales they do now. Which wouldn't solve the problem that I view as faith in a religion.

As far as evidence goes it depends on which Jesus you want to talk about.

307,"&gt;don't expect to be invited to the events of a private party.

Well, that's the thing. I don't think the party should be private. If you want to use that analogy.

&gt;And these people would be able to figure it out by the general election? 

Yes, of course, many of them know before the primaries but again, the deadlines to register may get in the way. Then they not only don't get to vote for who they want in the primary but because said person doesn't win they don't get to vote for who they want in the general either.


&gt;I find it odd that you aren't advocating ending caucuses but rather are focusing on independents.

Well, i do advocate that, but the topic hadn't come up yet. 

&gt;you also need some citations for these claims.

In the report, i referenced as well as other reports they have done. It's been shown if you don't believe me then read the reports. 

&gt;50% of democrats said they would not vote for socialist, 40% said they would not vote for atheist

That's so so sad. I hate people sometimes, but even so, I think those people would easily vote Sanders over Trump AND would likely be informed enough to know that Sanders is not either. 

I don't think Sanders would have had any problem against Trump. I can't speak for other candidate comparisons. It's a shame he didn't win the primary as I believe he should have and believe there is sufficient evidence to support that. ",2016-09-13 02:03:17+00:00,d7kfpzl,17.0,t1_d7ke042,2444.0,politics
308,"&gt;If they want a say in how a private party conducts business they should join the party.

No, not all people are loyal to a party, nor should they be. Many voters decide based on who the candidates are and if they are restricted to vote in 1 party then they may not be able to vote for who they want. Voting needs to be easier not harder. 

&gt;If independents were so important and so in favor of Sanders then Sanders should have won a majority, right?

No, because some people didn't know the deadlines of registration or weren't sure of who they wanted to vote for by then. Stop acting like making voting more difficult is a good thing. 

&gt; How did the people purging the rolls know who the Sanders voters were?

Paper votes were counted for Clinton even if the vote was for Sanders, and electronic machines were shown to only register Clinton votes in some areas. 

&gt;He would be educating not campaigning.


He would be doing both. And that's not only fine with me, but it would be better than Clinton as she only campaigns. 

&gt;&gt;if he were an atheist I would view that as a positive thing, as it is one less thing to worry about clouding his judgment.

&gt;So would I. But once again polls clearly show that the majority of Americans would not and that is the point.

I understand that, but I don't think that would be a big deal. The people who were that upset over something so minute probably weren't going to vote democratic in the first place. 

&gt;Serious question. Is this the first election you have followed?

Second one I have followed, first one I've gotten somewhat involved in.

311,"Independent voters are allowed to vote in the general, they should be allowed to vote in the primaries as well.

Sanders had the majority of independent voters in most of the polls back then, but so few of them were allowed to vote in the primaries it didn't really give him the boost he needed. 

They should be allowed to vote in primaries. 

As far as we know only a small percentage of people had their registrations changed. But that's not the point. The point is that it only happened to Sanders voters and delegates that would then be stripped of credentials through no fault of their own.

Clinton got a ton of media coverage both positive and negative. I would rather Sanders have gotten that so people who didn't know him could at least know who he is and then maybe do the research they wanted to later on. 

You clearly haven't been listening to me or maybe you just don't want to. That election justice USA lawsuit and the report is the basis of my position here, with polls and anecdotal evidence on top of the that. 

Bernie would have obliterated Trump or really any or the Republican candidates with maybe the exception of Kasich where it would have been closer.

He's not a socialist , he's a democratic socialist and both of those things should not be viewed negatively unless someone is ignorant of what those titles mean in a capitalistic society.

He also isn't an atheist as far as we know. He is a ""non-practicing jew"" so people can take that for what they want, but if he were an atheist I would view that as a positive thing, as it is one less thing to worry about clouding his judgment.

If you disagree then fine, but I can't possibly see how more people liked Clinton over Bernie when she is struggling against the most hated candidate in history (Trump) a man that did extremely poorly against Sanders in nearly every poll there was.

Apart from not seeing the evidence for an afterlife at all, I will, for the sake of discussion, pretend there is for a moment. 

An interesting topic that I have discussed with family members who are believers is the question of what exactly ""gets"" someone into hell. 

Some say that people who have done something as innocent as masturbate will go to hell if they don't repent, others have said that someone as terrible as Hitler could go to heaven if he repented and was sorry for the sins he committed. 

None of it really makes much sense, to be honest. If there is a god I would hope that they just let everyone into heaven except the most heinous people of all. 

It's normal to be confused. There are a ton of ambiguous or contradicting statements in the bible, it's hard to really get 1 solid picture of what it the ""true word of god"". 

My answer, of course, is that there is no word of god and that the idea of heaven and hell were simply created to keep people in line and order in whatever civilization was using religion at the time. ",2016-08-20 04:18:14+00:00,d6p0xcu,1.0,t3_4yktym,31137.0,Christianity

677,"&gt;They are political narratives, not facts or objective truths.

I disagree.

&gt;So when Killer Mike said ""a uterus does not qualify one for the presidency"" at a Sanders rally, his comment was supporting civil rights and had nothing to do with Clinton's gender?

No how the hell does one ever come to that conclusion or assumption?

That had everything to do with her gender. But her supporters MADE IT about that. People want a women as president, and that's fine, but you can't elect someone just because they are the gender you prefer for the situation. THAT is was Killer Mike was talking about. How that is even questionable is beyond me. 

I get where you're coming from on the Trump video, I just happen to agree with TYT on that scenario. 

As far as the Bernie video we are in disagreement. TYT was not biased in that video they were simply explaining what happend.

680,"&gt;The track records you are referring to are narratives pushed by biased outlets like TYT or Fox News.

No, they are blatantly obvious on their own. 

&gt;Many pro-Clinton outlets say the Sanders campaign has a sexist track record, but that track record doesn't count does it?

No, because it is again blatantly untrue. If they said he has a history of protecting Civil Rights then that would be a true statement.

&gt;Trump never mentioned Garner at all, he wasn't talking about anything related to the Garner incident, police, or black people. He was talking about Romney. Yet it was racist. 

That is a fair point. It is an assumption based on previous tendencies by the man that spoke. Regardless of whether he meant it to be racist or not though it was still a childish thing to do and he deserved to be treated like a fool since he was acting like one. 

&gt;The Sanders surrogate called Clinton out by name twice, then immediately followed it up with the corporate whores remark.

Well, he did explain afterwards that it was meant to reference members of congress. But I have to say even if he directly said ""corporate democratic whores like Clinton"" I would still back the guy as long as the context was that of big money in politics and Clinton's continued showing that she cares more about money and her donors than about average American citizens. 

This is what he was referring to regardless of whether he meant to say it about Clinton, congress members or both. 

So still I don't see the problem with supporting him. The use of the word whore might have been uncalled for but it was honest and truthful. That can't be denied in the political context it was spoken in. ",2016-04-28 01:20:57+00:00,d2k4fu1,17.0,t1_d2k3fph,1542.0,SandersForPresident

Same with any other democrat.

I don't think there is any reason for the backlash against the Democratic surrogate and TYT agreed for the most part with that sentiment. 

Trump, however, has been saying and ""acting"" things that are just inexcusable and deserves ridicule for. 

If Clinton does something that deserves ridicule TYT ridicules her.

If Sanders does something that deserves ridicule TYT ridicules him.

The only difference is that Sanders doesn't deserve much ridicule and the other two do!

Even if Trump wasn't referring to Garnder he still made an ass of himself regardless. Trump makes himself look stupid and TYT is one of the few news shows that comments on and can make fun of it. 

There is no bias being shown in these videos. Maybe there has been in other videos, but I watch the majority of their content and have not seen anything as of yet.  ",2016-04-27 20:35:28+00:00,d2jswv4,11.0,t1_d2js0ef,1168.0,SandersForPresident
685,"&gt;they don't mention her popular vote lead (of millions of votes), kind of an important detail to ignore, especially when they make arguments that lower turnout benefits Clinton (the fact is it doesn't, Sanders performs his best in the very low turnout caucus states).

They have mentioned that she is leading which is the important thing to make note of. 

Clinton wouldn't have the popular vote if independents were allowed to vote in all of the primaries and if people weren't forced to jump through hoops just to vote.

Sanders is more popular, he draws bigger crowds, he raises just as much if not more money than Clinton, (and that says a lot considering how small his donations are) he does better in the general election polls and has a higher favorability rating than any of the candidates, MUCH higher than Clinton to be honest. 

There is absolutely no reason Sanders would lose this election if it were ACTUALLY up to the voters and said voters ACTUALLY were able to vote. 

Sanders is supposed to do better with high turnouts and he has in some instances. If there was a high turn out and he didn't do well that would be because it happened to be a closed primary, or a more conservative state (which the Democrats won't win in the General anyway)

As for the videos, I'll be honest I didn't really see anything wrong there. 

The first video, where the guy used the phrase ""corporate whores"" was maybe a little tasteless but completely reasonable for one to say. The only problem there would maybe be the use of an unkind word but honestly, people shouldn't care about that. Jimmy made a great point saying ""that people are more upset that he used a word instead of being upset about what he was talking about when he said poor people can't see a doctor because of corporate democrats."" THAT was the point of using the word and I think it was a fair use.

As far as the second video goes I'm not sure what the problem is? Trump has a history of being out of line in his speech and made a reference to Eric Garner in a rather distasteful way. I mean you could say it's not the biggest deal in the world, but it's certainly not something a presidential candidate or really anyone should be ""re-enacting"" you know?

The biggest difference I see here is that the first video was actually about a problem facing the country that got turned into a ""he said a bad word"" kind of BS story and the second video was about nothing important. What's the point of talking shit about Romney? Even if you do why the need to reenact a choking scene? AND make a reference to a recent event in a disrespectful way.

The point is that many girls have dated Toby. I think Olga and Jacyln being the most important since they dated him the longest and most recently.

Jaclyn Glenn confirmed this in her video, making note that whenever she didn't want have sex, it would be a huge turn off for Toby. 

Olga K also said she had never been drugged or abused in anyway and she dated Toby the longest I believe. 

Also, April has a history of being very jealous and passive aggressive. 

I think if Olga or Jacalyn came forward instead of her then it might be a different story but she is just not trustworthy when asking for opinions on Toby.

That would go along with the whole ""god of the gaps"" argument. Just because you don't understand something doesn't mean that a supernatural being is the cause.

1286,"&gt;&gt;RD does give you the opportunity to improve your deck.

Barely though. 

&gt;&gt; I don't know how long you've been playing this game but that's ridiculous and will never/should never happen.

I've been playing since the beginning of season 1 a year ago with a 2 month gap over the winter, and i simply disagree. If i can't play for an event card i REALLY like then i should be given another chance to play for it down the road at least. These cards are only available once (or twice now that pairs have been split) and that sucks for people who don't pay 100's of dollars for card packs in the beginning to be able to play for them. 

 &gt;&gt;You aren't. The first RD card is always a throwaway bonus card.
URs and Epics could help you quite a bit though

That's where i think they need to change the rewards at least give me two ultra rares or even two epics.

&gt;&gt; It's to be expected that if you want the second one, you'll have to spend quite a bit again and buy legendary packs.

The difference is that i would theoretically have a chance to get an RTG event card with a rare deck, but i don't even have a chance in RD with an Ultra Rare or Epic deck. That is the problem. 

They should allow you to play for all the cards in RD but make you start at or below your tier level. I would much rather go through 5 cards in RD and get the event than go through 3 and not really get anything out of it.

""Season 2 cards open up new possibilities and strategic avenues. As you train Season 2 cards, you earn tokens that can be used to permanently increase their stats. Want the fastest Triple H card in the game? Or the strongest Mark Henry? Play your way by customizing your Season 2 cards.""

So you can train up certain skills of cards similar to that of EV training in pokemon if you have ever played that. 

""Play your favorite cards of Superstars from the WWE and NXT. The Season 2 roster includes Brock Lesnar, Kevin Owens, Samoa Joe, Neville, The Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Charlotte, and many more.""

Updated roster with a bunch of NXT additions.


""Season 2 introduces an additional Divas slot in Exhibition and events. Play your best Divas in new Tag Matches or, potentially, multiple singles matches in card battles.""

Exhibition has 6 cards now with 4 superstars and 2 divas.

""In Season 2, the Fusion Chamber can convert your Season 1 cards into powerful Season 2 variants of the same card. If you want to keep playing with your Season 1 cards in Season 1, you totally can. Your cards are your cards.""

They have to elaborate more this but if you want to transfer your Season 1 cards to Season 2 it is an instant fusion. 

""In Season 2’s King of the Ring, we’re flipping the script on line-ups. Your entire 10-person King of the Ring team will be active during the run of the mode, meaning that any Superstar, Legend, or Diva in your deck could be called up in an event to battle. Balancing your deck will be crucial to taking the crown; you’ll want all your best cards in your line-up and customized in ways that compliment each other. Have a bunch of POW guys in your line-up? Consider throwing some SPD into the mix, either by collecting a speedster or customizing cards to make them faster.""

So all 10 cards in Season 2 KOTR are active. You have 2 separate superstar tag teams and 1 diva tag team. Then another single diva, and 3 single superstars.

You can store up to 25 energy and you get an energy card after every exhibition game. 

Boosts can be used as well i believe but they are called enhancements i think. 

""For instance, if you slot a POW enhancement in a card and it competes in a POW match-up, that card’s POW will be increased for that match. So, in addition to balancing your deck, you’ll want to make sure you’re strategically slotting in Enhancements.""

This week's event will be a PCC for Season 2 cards. I'm not sure if Season 1 will have events anymore though.

You can still play as normal with your Season 1 cards in Exhibitoin and the KOTR you are accustomed too, but i think they are trying to get people to jump to Season 2.",2015-08-19 02:05:09+00:00,cu7skeh,1.0,t3_3hixg9,2164.0,wwesupercard

Obviously if someone is a hunter they have rifles for a reason, but i don't really see the need for weapons to that extent in everyday life. 

I certainly wouldn't want someone walking around in public with a rifle. I don't like people walking around with pistols in public but i understand it because at least if they had bad intentions there is a limited clip size. 

I think people should maybe have the right to own these weapons as long as they are cleared mentally and keep them in there homes out of reach from children or anyone who does have mental problems. 

&gt;&gt;Well, the prisons are quite full though

See i would use prisons to hold people in these situations. People who should not be introduced back into society.

The prisons are full but full of the wrong people. We give people 20 years to life for possession of drugs. That seems a little steep too me. 

Maybe 5 years and some rehab would be better for those people. Even for people who have committed a non violent crime are getting long prison sentences and i think if we could fix that we wouldn't need the death penalty (except for maybe extreme circumstances) because the prisons wouldn't be as full.

&gt;&gt;I don't mind Sanders too much, I mean, obviously I disagree with him on many things but at least he doesn't seem to be corrupt. Why would you vote for Clinton though?

[Here's](http://presidential-candidates.insidegov.com/compare/35-40-57/Bernie-Sanders-vs-Hillary-Clinton-vs-Rand-Paul) a good comparison of the three of them. 

Paul wants to ""keep god in the public sphere"" While Clinton opposes and Sanders strongly opposes.  So here i would vote Sanders&gt; Clinton&gt; Paul

Paul favors gun ownership, Clinton Opposes, and Sanders has a neutral opinion. So here i would vote Sanders. 

Paul opposes Obamacare while Clinton and Sanders look to expand upon it. I am a fan of Obamacare. so i would vote Sanders or Clinton.

Sanders and Clinton favor prioritizing green energy Paul does not. I would vote for Sanders or Clinton.

Paul opposes higher taxes on the rich while Clinton and Sanders favor that. I would vote Sanders or Clinton. 

There are plenty of other things to look at there, but in comparison Paul seems like a much better candidate than all of the other Republicans. Is almost as good as Clinton and nowhere close to Sanders in my opinion.

&gt;&gt;I'm pro-gun

Ok so you're pro-gun. Do you think there should be any limits as to what kind of guns people are allowed to purchase?

Like do you have a difference in opinion between people owning pistols and people owning shotguns or semi-automatic weapons?

&gt;&gt;I'm against affirmative action

I have mixed feelings on affirmative action but i think something needs to be done about a lot of the low-income communities throughout the country that for one reason or another consist of mostly minorities.

For example i don't want to give anyone special treatment but think some kids do need better opportunities when it comes to education and what not. Leading to them having a better chance in getting a job when they are older. 

&gt;&gt;I'm against abortion

Ok so i would say i understand your opinion on this much more than i would someone from the christian right.

What do you think about women who have been raped? Should they be allowed to terminate a pregnancy?

If were put in a situation where a girl i was with wanted to get an abortion i probably wouldn't be angry. I would talk about and think about all the possible situations but ultimately i'm not the one that would have to go through the pregnancy so i wouldn't try and force a decision on her either way. 

From reading the link you included it said you have no problem with sex education or some variants of birth control. Is this right?

I haven't really come to a conclusion on when i believe an embryo becomes a fetus or what we call a baby yet. But i don't have any problem with someone getting an abortion before a certain point in the pregnancy. I have not really done enough research to know exact weeks or anything but i would say maybe up until 20 weeks or so i don't really have a problem with it. 

I obviously would't approve of one being done in the third trimester but again i think all women should have the right to choose. Especially if there are health concerns. 

&gt;&gt;I'm for the death penalty

In all instances? What crime would you constitute worthy of the death penalty?

I seem to have more sympathy for criminals with mental problems or those who have done something by accident. 

I would say there are some people who are are deserving of the death penalty but then i would argue a better punishment would be to keep them in prison their whole lives. 

&gt;&gt;I'm supporting Rand Paul in the next election and I'll vote for anyone who's not Hillary

See my best case scenario is Rand Paul vs Bernie Sanders.

I am a huge supporter of Sanders. I can't stand most of the Republican candidates and Rand Paul isn't perfect but is the best of that party.

I would probably vote Sanders&gt; Clinton &gt; Paul

There are people who really tried and were not able to get these cards and there were people who simply were not playing when those cards came out. 

If you bought a card back then people who missed it should be able to buy it now.

If you earned a card back then people should be able to earn them now. 

You said you didn't spend any money so you shouldn't be angry. 

For those who did spend  money they shouldn't be pissed at this idea either. 

IT DOESN'T AFFECT THEM. Giving everyone the chance to play for the cards is important. 

Like i said if they added a feature to RTG where you could choose an old event card or the current one to play for then there would be no reason for anyone to complain. 

If someone got the chance to play for an old card they would lose the chance to play for the current one. 

People could play for the cards they want, don't be ass dude, it doesn't affect you or any of the people who got the cards already. 

If anything it would be better for you guys who have all the event cards because when they release a new event card less people would be earning them that weekend.",2015-07-31 19:11:34+00:00,ctn4m83,8.0,t1_ctminrd,46393.0,wwesupercard

And I wasn't playing until the WM RTG so I missed all the SV RTGs.

Also sure you can plus 1 on RTG but you still need a decent deck to even have a chance at getting the event cards. Like SV + at a minimum.

So again excluding PCC cards the event cards should be earnable again. 

I don't think being able to buy them would be fair to anyone. 

Those that earned them would feel cheated and those paying for them would feel cheated.

1535,"So i have a few ideas.

1. A new event all together where previous event cards would be available to play for. If you only got a sinlge the first time you play for a single to make a pro. If you prod the card already you don't get to earn the cards again but have alternate regular non event WM cards you can play for if you want. If you missed both cards all together then you could play for both.

2. Same as number 1 but instead of a weekend event it could be a mid week event so everyone could still play for event cards during the weekend. 

3. Idk how we could make PCC cards available again, but when it comes to RTG cards they could be alternate cards in the normal RTG event.

So similiar to how we have to ""choose a side"" in PCC we could choose to either play for a certain RTG event card from the past or whatever the new current event card is for the week.

So the last event card was Lesnar, they could offer an option to play for maybe the WM Bret Hart that came out instead. 

I'm sure there would be a way to do this and maybe they could allow people to play for cards they already earned or maybe not. 

But i think 3 is the best option. If they had the SV RTG cards available in the situation maybe they could replace the regular SV card instead and have a regular WM card as the last card on the list. 

Any ideas?

I think it's important that people can't buy these, at least right now, but being able to earn them would be awesome. ",2015-07-30 23:42:26+00:00,ctm6b0q,1.0,t3_3f7fio,10904.0,wwesupercard

2. We might like seeing more people become atheists but the real goal is just to educate people and make sure everyone knows the truth about certain things.

You very rarely see homophobic atheists, which is good.

You often see that homophones are religious,which is bad. 

We can't have nor should we have a government based on any deity or ""higher power"" because that gives those in control the thought that they can do whatever they want. 

Lastly i and many others just hate ignorant people or ignorance as a whole. So by trying to teach people and educate them that can help eliminate such ignorance. 

This is when religious people start taking offense and throwing hissy fits because they start to realize that all their beliefs were bullshit, and in order to keep their dignity they say we are ""attacking them"" which in turn is also bullshit.

If he had traveled down the left then he surely would have been eaten and if he had traveled down the right there would be no reason for him to leave.

1704,"Both WWE and Reigns have done a great job with his career so far. The only reason he isn't champion or more successful is because their are so many fans that like being assholes and put him down. 

He would have been champion at Wrestlemania if fans weren't so butt hurt that DB didn't win the Rumble and the Title match. 

Fans have treated him like shit and sucks because he is one of the best in the company on all playing fields. 

I only wish the company ignored all those people and gave him the belt instead of Rollins. Rollins was stale before Wrestlemania and probably ever since he broke off from the Shield. 

I'm tired if him and would love for Lesnar to crush him like a bug and send him out for a few months so they can do something else with him in the future. ",2015-06-16 21:05:04+00:00,cs8t65t,1.0,t3_3a21h3,15294.0,SquaredCircle
