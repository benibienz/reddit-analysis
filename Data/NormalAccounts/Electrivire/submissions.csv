FIRST CLAIM:

I got a copyright claim the other day for showing [this](https://youtu.be/trkdn5H6vG0?t=15m10s) part of the game. 

**This is not my video or channel, my video is currently blocked but this is the exact clip that was shown on my channel (as it's part of the main campaign) with the only difference being that i full screened the T.V for part of the speech.**

The Claimant was Take 2 Interactive which made me curious because i thought they would have been smarter. 

Rockstar's full policy on monetization and posting of copyrighted content can be viewed [here](https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200153756-Policy-on-posting-copyrighted-Rockstar-Games-material)

In it, it states

&gt;To make our position on this subject easier to understand, we have put together a list of content that, if posted, would result in a take-down notice:

&gt;&gt;Pre-Release Footage: No pre-release leaked footage of any kind: Any posting of in-game footage from leaked copies of the game prior to its official release date will be taken down, regardless of how the game was obtained. This includes ""early unboxing"" videos.

&gt;&gt;Spoilers: Posting video showing the ending of the game, pure cutscenes or any other big reveal in the story. It's ok to show cutscenes as part of a larger play-through (or in a narrated ‘Let’s Play’ type video) but isolated videos of the game's cinematics will be removed. If you are unsure if what you want to post is considered a spoiler, please contact copyright@take2games.com and describe exactly what scene you are wondering about and in what context the scene would appear.

&gt;&gt;Encouraging Cheating: Videos posted that encourage and promote ways to cheat your way towards gaining illegitimate RP or in-game money or duplicating counterfeit in-game items.

&gt;&gt;**In-game Entertainment: Things like the TV shows and comedy performances in Grand Theft Auto IV, or the silent movies in Red Dead Redemption. We prefer fans to experience these in the context of the game's world, so any posting of these in isolation will be flagged for removal.**

So i think the video got taken down because an automatic system thought the thing on the t.v was like a show or something. I'm not sure, but i do know the claim is false. 

Not sure if i should contact them at the email provided or not.





SECOND CLAIM:

This one seems much simpler and is obviously ridculous. 

You can view the segmant involved [here](https://youtu.be/fGIu6JfIY8Y?t=41s)
 (again not my video or channel)

The audio from this scene is what's in question and the the Claimant is ""TuneCore on behalf of Glo Gang"" With the content being ""Trevor (Interlude) - Lil Flash. 

So i looked up Lil Flash and found [this](https://soundcloud.com/lil-flash-gta-music/lil-flash-trevor-outro) on soundcloud. 

He apparently thinks he owns the content and is trying to put ads on my video. 



So i filed a dispute on the first claim and haven't done anything on the second. What do you guys think? What do you reccomend? Did i miss any needed info? 

Thanks for any help. ",youtube,2 copyright claims in 2 days. Getting a little upset. (GTA V Let's Play),https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/4prfar/2_copyright_claims_in_2_days_getting_a_little/

I don't agree with those reasons (at least not completely) but I do understand them.

Now I've been a fan of Reigns since the shield debuted on the main roster. I was also a fan of Ambrose and to a slightly lesser extent Rollins. (I know another unpopular opinion)

Ever since Rollins broke off from the group I was tired of HIM and the whole Authority gimmick that made Kane look EVEN worse and kind of stagnated Orton's career for a while. 

Now onto Reigns. I like his in ring style a lot. Just as I like Rollins and Ambrose in the ring. (all for different reasons of course) I thought they all deserved to be in the main event picture but Reigns just seemed like a good choice for World Champion to me. I think a lot of people would have agreed with me if it wasn't for Daniel Bryan being so popular. (Someone I have always liked but never jumped on the hype train for, at least not until he won the I.C title.)

So I think people began to hate Reigns because he wasn't the face that the fans wanted to see win. I get that because I've had to sit and watch MANY superstars get pushed who I absolutely couldn't stand (E.G Del Rio) but I also figured it was for a reason. It was to tell a story and to entertain the fans in one way or another. 

So now we go onto WM 31. Reigns challenges Lesnar for the world title and everyone is pissed because it's not Bryan. I was ecstatic because it was a really good matchup. To powerful guys, that fight in real high energy matches. I would have been content if Lesnar beat him and retained and I would have been pretty siked if Reigns had overcome and won the World Title. All I wanted was an all out war and we ended up getting that for the most part. 

Now the part that everyone else seemed to love was also the worst moment of the Mania for me and honestly ruined the main event from what I was hoping it would be. Instead of the match ending with there being a clear winner and, therefore, champion, Rollins comes down and interferes in the match. If that wasn't bad enough he then steals the win and the Championship. I get that it was exciting for people to see because it was a Money in the Bank cash in, but I would have MUCH preferred it happen the next night to a beat up and bruised champion regardless of who it was. 

So Rollins goes on to be champion for over 200 days as I constantly hoped he would Kayfabe get injured and drop the belt. (turns out he actually ended up getting hurt and I kind of felt bad, but not really)

So my big problem at this point is that Reigns and Lesnar didn't get to finish their amazing match a Mania and never got a rematch either. 

Now move onto this past year's Royal Rumble where everyone wanted ANYONE but Reigns to win. Again I had no problem with him winning if did, I figured he would be in the main event at WM again the problem I had was that it was against HHH. I would have preferred Ambrose or Styles (which it looks like we will get to see now) or someone else. Anyway, I think it's a popular opinion that the match at Mania this past weekend was nothing special. I know am left feeling bored of Reigns and although I don't hate him like most people seem to I certainly am getting tired of seeing the same stuff. 

I think a heel turn is imminent and hopefully, Styles actually ends up winning the title. 

O.K now you guys can tell me how great Bryan, Rollins and Del Rio are and why Reigns and Cena suck. I'm all ears haha.
