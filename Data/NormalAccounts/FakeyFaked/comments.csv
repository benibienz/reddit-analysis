0,Electoral politics are not a winning strategy and not how the labor movement was built.  ,2016-11-22 06:19:31+00:00,daaobrm,,t1_daaknzz,6802.0,missouri
1,"Protests are for more reasons than to 'change minds' of legislators. And it certainly isn't to try and get votes in elections.  They build solidarity, build infrastructure for mobilization, and the best ones strike fear into people, but unfortunately union leaders aren't as gutsy as they should be nowadays. 

I recall a friend at the Capitol during a protest, as they slammed on the door with hundreds chanting ""Let Us In!""  He looked around, saw two security guys v. hundreds of protesters, and tried to change the chant to ""Let's GO In!""  That would have been far more effective.  

In Michigan though, yes, of course the protesters were constituents.  Unions show up for stuff.  No need to bring in out of state members. 

Electoral politics, internal to the union and external in politics, have fucked the labor movement.  Better tactics are needed.  Blue dog democrats are bullshit too and have done labor no favors.  ",2016-11-22 04:17:51+00:00,daakcj3,,t1_daahw8m,3542.0,missouri

7,"The ""freeloader problem"" is a big one.  Basically, if a non-paying member needs representation the union is *required* to give it to them as per federal law.  They cannot choose to 'not represent' those that do not pay.  This can incur large costs including legal costs in some cases.  The freeloading worker also is a beneficiary of the union contract, even though they do not pay for the bargaining process of it.  

Additionally, it undermines the democracy of unionism.  Unions are voted into existence by all the workers.  Allowing people to opt out of paying means that vote has less meaning.  

There is the option that the union can change a contract in order to stop representing non-members, but that gets very dicey.  Employers would then give the non-members the same (or even better) treatment/pay/etc for those not on the contract, in order to devalue the utility of the union.  Once the union becomes busted, it's back to low wages and no job security.  ",2016-11-20 01:09:47+00:00,da7moj8,,t1_d9tdjiq,,missouri

18,"Not only that, but I would think that some other aspects of day-to-day operations would tone down on the night shift.  Think about the science experiments and mapping duties going on every day.  

There isn't a need for 3-shift 24 hour crew to perform the science functions on the Intrepid class (or any class for that matter) starship.  In the daytime there's probably more to manage regarding ship resources.  

e.g. *more energy needs to go to the hydropoinics bay because of an experiment ensign Kelly is trying to finish, they need a 10 kiloquad burst throughout this section to get the best results* 

*Seven of Nine is requesting a sensor sweep of this particular sector to get a better image of a binary cluster*

*Neelix needs a couple of extra hands for the lunch rush as his primary stew he had prepared seems to have gone rancid.  Can Ops send a couple of crew down to help?*

Night shift would see a slowing down of these things.  Assuming that most of the crew is on a regular day/night sleep schedule, and only the officers and those running the ship would have to be 24 hours, then yeah, the night shift may be a little slower in activity.

Privatization was going on in DWSD by outsourcing workers.  Do you remember the strike?  They were going to outsource 80% of the workers.  Privatization doesn't just mean making an entire department private.  They privatize sections of the bureaucracy.

Second, Josiah is blaming neoliberalization of the public sector pretty clearly.  He definitely mentions that the EM laws are racist. But you didn't even read the context of the paragraph - 

&gt;Others focus on the larger issue of lead pipes and decaying infrastructure, or the criminal negligence of Governor Rick Snyder and his administration. Still others note that the long history of housing discrimination in Flint, and the racist application of emergency manager laws, help explain why the majority of the poisoning victims are African American (although they include many working-class whites).

&gt;Corporate media coverage, however, has ignored the relationship between the water crisis in Flint and ongoing mass water shutoffs in Detroit. More broadly, it has obscured the role of neoliberal restructuring in undermining one of the nation’s largest water systems, and in leaving over one hundred thousand people without running water in a state surrounded by the Great Lakes.

&gt;Between 1977 and 2010, DWSD was under an EPA consent decree for Clean Water Act violations. Judge John Feikens, an arrogant racist and longtime opponent of school desegregation, recommended Victor Mercado to head DWSD in 2002. Mercado was a former vice president of Thames North America (an offshoot of Thames Water, privatized by Margaret Thatcher in 1989) and United Water (a subsidiary of the French multinational Suez).

&gt;In 2003, United Water took over Atlanta’s water system, with disastrous results. In Detroit, Mercado cut DWSD’s maintenance and repair staff by 13 percent, and accelerated the outsourcing of unionized jobs to private contractors. This process continued under Mercado’s successors, culminating in 2012 when DWSD signed a contract with EMA, Inc. that included plans to lay off 81 percent of DWSD’s staff, leading to a strike by AFSCME Local 207.

&gt;While Mercado laid off unionized workers and **illegally rigged bids with private contractors,** water rates in Detroit more than doubled. At the same time, as a result of welfare reform, the number of recipients of cash assistance in Wayne County fell from 198,000 in 1995–96 to 32,613 in 2003, and to 15,238 by 2013.

No native caricature Chief Illiniwek at Illinois is allowed.  CMU is still not allowed to host NCAA postseason events, which is understandable because that's their policy and even though they negotiate with the tribe not every person may be in approval of the usage of the name.  It's a hard place because tribal leadership in the past have said they did *not* want CMU to change the name.  If there was anything close to a tasteful way of doing this, they have pretty much done it. ",2016-10-20 21:36:40+00:00,d90wj5u,4.0,t1_d90njnk,11246.0,baseball

74,"Opaka becomes a mediator in the first peace talks between the two factions.  The meetings are contentious to say the least.  I'm sure that multiple times fights break out, and Opaka is killed many times over just to be revived over and over like the warring factions.  

But what Opaka brings that these factions never truly had, was faith.  Her faith in the Prophets and the promise of peace inspires leaders of both sides.  Eventually the peace talks become a curiosity for the Ennis and Nol-Ennis, as their perseverance to wipe out the other is matched by Opaka's perseverance to make peace, despite their brutality toward her and each other during talks.  Although the talks end in failure every time, Opaka is trusted by both factions.  This leads her to approach the mediation in a different manner.  

Opaka meets with factions separately, not in an attempt to broker peace anymore.  She feels that bridge is burned but at the very least she can proselytize the way of the Prophets so that the fighters may find internal peace, even though they experience eternal war.  She relays the stories about the Occupation, and how Bajorans through all of their fighting still had their reliance on faith, and that faith was stronger than the strongest Cardassian weapons.  This piques the interest of the Ennis and Nol-Ennis, thinking that this may be a way they can eradicate the other.  Instead, the teachings have a different effect on them.  

Rather than pursue the end of their enemies, they desire to become closer to the Prophets.  Even though at first it is motivated by the destruction of their foes, Opaka cleverly and wisely instructs that the path to the Prophets is only for the pure of heart, so violent motivations will always obstruct the way.  Fights rage on but some people begin to follow Opaka's teachings and become less interested in fighting.  Years pass and no headway is being made in battle, but significant numbers of people now begin to question the leaders obsession with the destruction of the other faction.  The questions turn into changes, and the peace table looks more appealing again.  

Now talks restart, but not between the leadership, but between Opaka's students on both sides of the warring parties.  Trust begins to be established, and what seemed like an impossibility now is a distinct, but distant, possibility for normalized relations.  

The unthinkable happens, but not in the way Opaka would have predicted, however.  The peace talks result in non-aggression between both sides, but only to work together to find an answer to get off the moon.  Their motivation?  Not to separate, nor to work together, but rather to get revenge upon those who imprisoned them to endure the cruel fate dealt to them.  Opaka knows that the vengeful nature of the Ennis and Nol-Ennis may never be ameliorated, but it will be a long time until they are able to leave the moon, and even she wonders how the authority that imprisoned them are unlike the cruel brutality of the Cardassians?  She has much work to do, but the first steps are now in place.

167,"I think most of the comments here are ignoring the last part of /u/RollAwayTheDew77's post, and for me, its the most significant part.  How DO you change the shift rotations?  

We've always heard about a ""day"" crew and then the ""night shift.""  But we know that there's actually at least 3 shifts going on in a standard starship rotation.  Captain Jellico changed that to a 4 shift rotation, which still is equalized at 6 hours per shift.  

26 hours makes a bit of a difference.  I don't see the Federation mandating longer than an 8 hour shift for a few reasons.  Studies have already shown that a 6 hour shift garners higher productivity and some nations are moving toward a 30 hour work week as a result.  But 26?  Does that mean 4 shifts of 6 and a half hours?  The amount of crew needed just was increased by 25%.  Do you do 3 shifts with two going the extra hour in exchange for possibly an extra day off during the week?  

Not to mention that we don't have a definitive idea of what a week is on DS9 either.  I mean, if the amount of time in a day is different, what about the amount of days in a week?  If the work week is shortened/lengthened what effect does that have?  I would be inclined to think that the week has to be standardized in some way, based on the amount you want people to work/not work.  

I'm interested though in theorizing about what the duty shift structure on DS9 would look like in a 26 hour day.  Do they carry that much extra crew, or do they lengthen a shift or two in exchange for more time off?  ",2016-09-13 05:43:13+00:00,d7knr5q,1.0,t3_52bvcd,101932.0,DaystromInstitute

219,"Great subject to talk about, kudos OP.  Thinking about this I had a couple of items that I think come into play that we may not be considering.  

First, planets that apply for Federation membership I would assume are already self-sustaining.  There is not likely a big need for extensive trade outside the star system as the civilization already has attained warp capability without the aid of the Federation.  I make the argument that the planets in the Federation has already been able to survive using its own resources so the need isn't as great for interplanetary trade.  

However, trade does have to occur.  Dilithium for example, cannot be replicated.  We see Klingons taking advantage of Dilithium mines run by other species in Enterprise.  If Dilithium as an element cannot be replicated, it makes sense that other raw materials that are sufficiently rare also is going to need to be traded in order to acquire them.  So why don't we hear about the millions of trading ships across the galaxy?  I posit a couple of explanations. 

First, those ships exist.  Jake and Nog contact multiple trading vessels and manage to get an entire gross of self-sealing stem bolts!  That occurs only using a future equivalent of CB radio contacting ships as they pass by.  Neelix and Mayweather both were on cargo ships and Neelix was basically scavenging a debris field when encountered.  

So we see *some* of the ships that would be a part of trade, but why not lots more?  One reason that I speculate on this is that warp drive makes ships far more efficient in the transference of cargo.  Weight of cargo is not an issue when you have warp capability.  The only thing that would restricts the amount of cargo a ship can carry would be the size of the cargo.  This is a very big advantage when comparing to merchant fleets on our oceans that have to consider how much cargo can be carried while still floating above water.  Consider Mayweather's family freighter, and how the cargo storage was modular.  I would venture a guess that the warp drive, while not as fast as many ships, would be able to create a much larger warp bubble than some starships so that it can add on a lot more modules should they need to.  Deliveries may be slow, but you can order items at a much larger volume than a container vessel on our oceans could produce.  The need for millions of ships then may be lessened.  (Although I do believe there is much more than what we have been privy to going on with trade).

228,"Neither my comment nor the court took that position.  The court did not take a position as to whether its ""good"" or ""bad.""  They said that the way Michigan tried to enact their ban disproportionately affects minority precincts and thus violates the Voting Rights Act.  I'll be more clear on some of their reasoning.

There were a few reasons that this was seen as the case.  One is that 5 cities with over 75% straight ticket voting in Michigan are majority black, and 13 of 15 cities with over 65% straight ticket voting.  

Another issue is the time at ballot boxes, which the court found would put undue pressure and reduce the opportunity to participate in elections for African Americans.

Fast thinking, note taking skills, evaluation of positions, all are a part of debate participation.  Debate participation pedagogically touches upon every level of Bloom's taxonomy.

I can vote for parties that are pro-war and pro-Palestinian apartheid and are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world.

Cool, great.  You have said nothing about how blacks are more prone to poverty and the reasons why that is the case.  So I guess I accept your apology?  

&gt;You cannot conflate it with seeking reparations or punitive damages.

Why do you keep inserting things that I didn't say?  

&gt;We need to find ways to fix the problems, not argue about what caused them.

Dude, you're the one arguing about it, in case you didn't notice.

415,"I'm not saying anything other than the fact that black cities experienced divestment more because of race than anything, and history bears that out.  And that unions were not immune to racism in the workplace.

416,"FIFO disproportionately affected black workers.  That's irrefutable.  Look to books - Detroit, I Do Mind Dying; Arc of Justice; and Origins of the Urban Crisis; Beautiful, Terrible Ruins.  UAW also in the past would place black workers in the most dangerous and worst jobs such as in paint rooms and foundrys.  The workplace was so bad that James Johnson was able to get a temporary insanity plea when he shot and killed his foreman at the job site.  

Do I think unions are a good thing?  Absolutely!  I'm not saying it's a ""racist"" organization.  But if you just say, ""Since the rules are the same then there's no way it can affect one group differently"" then that's putting on blinders.  The relationship between Reuther and MLK and then the movements of DRUM and LRBW is pretty complicated to say the least.  Just because I think unions are good, doesn't mean that I""m going to pretend like they don't have a pretty ambivalent history when it comes to race.  Yes, they were allies in the civil rights movement, but they also had problems when it came to policing itself internally.  

Equivocating a voting bloc as automatically above other issues is like saying, ""Well, since black people are voting for Hillary Clinton, I guess her racist policies don't exist anymore..""  Umm, no.  

Fighting seniority rules was a big part of black activism in the 40's, though - 

&gt;As World War II came to an end, jobs topped the
agenda of African Americans in New York City. The
war had brought substantial economic gains for many,
but now they feared a loss of those advances. AfricanAmerican
activists, along with their white allies, helped
persuade the New York state legislature to create the nation’s
first fair employment practices committee in 1945.
When enforcement proved to be timid, they lobbied repeatedly,
though usually unsuccessfully, for bolder efforts
to open employment opportunities. Likewise, activists
challenged union seniority rules and other labor
policies that prevented African Americans from obtaining
well-paying jobs. Tactics included filing lawsuits
over control of the longshoreman’s union, forming picket
lines, and staging a sit-in at the office of a corrupt and
racist union boss. Black labor leader A. Philip Randolph
complained of a “climate of terror, nepotism in the acquisition
of jobs and exclusion because of race” on the city’s
piers (p. 256). The relatively few gains made during this
era, however, often proved to be short-lived as jobs on the
piers were soon relocated or phased out due to automation.
Black leaders often took a race-conscious approach
to employment issues by stressing the need for employers
to recruit African-American workers and to compile
statistics as measures of progress. Such arguments would
foreshadow the affirmative action debate of later decades.

417,"&gt;Black communities are disproportionately less affluent because the cities they live in have failed.

Go back farther, why did they ""fail?""  

&gt;I don't know if it has been studied, but I think black people are probably less likely to leave the city they live in than whites are.

Yes, it's been studied.  There is inability to leave the city, and whites left cities like Detroit and Flint because they didn't want to live by blacks.  Blacks also were shut out of job markets for generations, and places like Detroit and Flint with the UAW only allowed access to the most dangerous jobs and had ""first-in, first-out"" seniority rules that ensured they would be the first to be laid off as well.  

&gt;If you look up north there are gigantic meth problems all over the place, rampant drug use, and poverty among white people.

I don't disagree with that.  But they aren't massively divested in like black cities are.  

&gt;The issues are not caused by race because money has no race.

This is a statement that puts blinders on to race.  There's so much evidence that contradicts this statement I don't think this thread will be productive.

Think special events in particular cities that people will actually be travelling to participate in (this happened for the smaller Ingress, it'll happen for Pokemon GO).  Think modifications as the game goes on.  Think about the day when PvP battles will happen.  This is the beginning.  Niantic had an incredible amount of production value as well as crowdsource participation to levels I never imagined for Ingress.  

This game has 10x the players at least already.  Even if it dies down on members (it will) the saturation in the market and putting the terminology ""augmented reality"" into everyday parlance will ensure it keeps up for a while.

527,"No, it won't cause those lines on their own, however, if it takes (and it does) 30% longer to fill in a paper ballot without the straight ticket option, the voter gets hurt.  

As for the City Clerk, there's lots of things wrong with the Detroit City Clerk.  But the amount of voting machines is not in the purview of the clerk.  Rather, it is a state appropriation.  And when one optical scan machine breaks down in a precinct with no backup, the lines get incredibly long (2008 this happened in Madison Heights, and the library precinct where i was voting extended over 4 hours.)  

I don't think you are conceiving of the volume of people that go vote during peak times at a precinct either.  When 200 people show up within the hour, it's not like you are going to have 200 voting booths, and certainly not like you're going to have 100 voting machines/readers.  

Have you voted before?  How many readers did your precinct have?  Sadly, it's not much different in any other precinct.  I voted at a very busy Detroit precinct.  About 15 booths, 2 reader machines (but there were 2 precincts at the same station, so one machine for each precinct).

Also, as a former union rep at a university, the ignorance that economics professors have regarding how Title IX or labor law works is dumbfounding.  

Title IX says you can't have single sex educational programs.  I am very doubtful that a federal court would rule that a study space would be considered an educational program.

If you want to really delve into this - there is this from the Title IX handbook - 

&gt;The Department’s Title IX regulations identify the following categories for which a recipient may
intentionally separate students by sex: (a) contact sports in physical education classes; (b) classes
or portions of classes in elementary and secondary schools that deal primarily with human
sexuality; and (c) nonvocational classes and extracurricular activities within a coeducational,
nonvocational elementary or secondary school if certain criteria are met.

&gt;With respect to the third category, a recipient may offer a single-sex nonvocational class or
extracurricular activity in a coeducational, nonvocational elementary or secondary school if the
class is based on one of two important objectives: to improve its students’ educational
achievement through its overall established policy to provide diverse educational opportunities or
to meet the particular, identified educational needs of its students. The single-sex nature of each
class must be substantially related to achievement of the important objective and the recipient
must implement its important objective in an evenhanded manner. In addition, enrollment in a
single-sex class must be completely voluntary and the recipient must provide a substantially equal
coeducational class in the same subject to all students, and may be required to provide a
substantially equal single-sex class for students of the excluded sex.

Bear in mind, you can actually have a separate CLASS for single sex if you can demonstrate a need to do it, and you offer the class for everybody as well outside of it. 

There's PLENTY of evidence that women can achieve higher academic goals if they have a separate space, and there certainly are study areas that are offered to the whole as well.  And, this isn't even a class.  

Using Title IX this way seems very inappropriate at first glance.

574,"&gt;But why then would you further segregate yourself as blacks by excluding those who want to help you.

That's a big assumption that every reporter is out to help you.  Simply isn't the case.  

&gt;I'd bet money if I show up to a BLM protest I'd be yelled at until I left.

You're wrong.  I've shown up to a few and I'm white as the driven snow.  (And it wasn't in a white town, it's in Detroit).  You're just factually incorrect here.  

I mean, if you show up with a Donald Trump shirt on, or if you show up questioning things or trying to lead instead of listen, sure, but you'd know it's not your job to lead but to support if its your first time at a protest.  

&gt;The world has gotten over sensitive and I've heard so many fight break out because ""you disrespected me"". That will never change. Free speech means people can say what they want. Here's a box of tissues. People on both sides need to grow up and look at the big picture. The only way you fight ignorance is through education and reform. Not matching police brutality with more violence, that's called escalation.

This is a total non-sequitur.  I'm not going to bother answering it because its not on topic. 

&gt;In the civil rights movement blacks AND whites who protested knew they'd be arrested and even beaten. They didn't fight back physically, they fought back socially and psychologically.

Wut?  You need a history lesson.  That's also just not true.  What do you think race riots are?  They are ""the voice of the unheard.""  That's fighting back.  I didn't want to continue this thread, but you can't just play fast and loose with the facts like this.  

&gt;To paraphrase ""I have a dream that my children will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.""

It's like you never read anything else by MLK.  Seriously, that's the most often quoted line from white people trying to tone-police black people.  Allow me to counter with a much more relevant one which refers to your strategy - 

&gt;I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

Sound familiar?  You agree with the cause but feel you have the right to dictate the proper and improper tactics.  MLK says that is worse than a KKK member.  Dwell on that.  The dream isn't here, so we cannot judge based on the content of character.  It hasn't come to fruition yet.  And the reason why it hasn't, is that white moderates believe in order before justice.  

(Not to mention, MLK was one of MANY civil rights leaders, much of which have been laid to the side because non-violence isn't as scary to those in power.  Try out ""The Ballot or the Bullet"" sometime.)",2016-07-13 03:30:14+00:00,d5a577j,7.0,t1_d5a4fhu,1296.0,PublicFreakout

644,"This will be my last message.  You're clearly at a point where you're trying to persuade more than listen, and that happens and is normal. 

&gt;It's how anything the State does works, the good and the bad is backed up by violence. Every single law it makes is enforced violently. It's about channelling that violence in legitimate ways. I'm not in denial about the oppression still faced by POCs at all...I have no idea why you would draw that conclusion from what I said. But I find it interesting that you descend so quickly to ""We aren't on the same side""...what I said was exactly how affirmative action works, and I'm not against it, I endorse it whole heartedly.

You use the language of libertarians in your description.  If you endorse AA, good for you.  

Having a threat behind control, yeah, that is a thing.  But you're looking at AA as if the state originated the idea of doing it and imposing its will upon others.  That's not the case.  AA comes about because of the threat of violence or delegitimacy against the state first.  Then the state capitulates.  Violence solves. 



&gt;You said the State is allied with the right when it grants them permits...it does the same thing for the left!!

But the left isn't advocating for genocidal actions.  That's why it's a false equivalence.  Stop saying that since permits are given to the left they're ""just as bad.""  It's not the permit itself, it's *what* they are permitting.  This is like saying my neighbor and I are allowed to have a knife.  I use it to chop food and my neighbor uses it to kill a bunch of people.  But it's the same thing because we're both using the knife.  

&gt;It's not counter-intuitive, you're not 'driving ideas from the marketplace', you're giving them more exposure.

If we're talking communication theory like you attempt to do below, you get a media bump for a hot minute but fear appeals work.  That's also proven.  Politicians use them all the time.  If the fear is credible, has magnitude, and is imminent, then less people sharing the same view will feel safe demonstrating, so long run it goes down.  Thinking it would keep going up is counter-intuitive.  Your links dont' work, too.  You can't link to the academic article, cuz that makes me sign into a place I can't do so.  Link to the abstract so I others can use their own college ID's to get in.  I'm not worried about it tho cuz ain't nobody else reading this thread.  

Also, allowing genocidal conspiracies ain't an advocacy I want to push for.  

&gt;I referred to an actual black musician who befriended clan members and got them to quit the clan. How is that tokenizing anything?

When you hold it up as a prescription of what POC's need to do in order to ""win"" against fascists, it's putting them in danger because of your own unwillingness to battle fascism and whiteness yourself.  And that's a pretty privileged place to sit.  I don't dismiss him or what he did.  Good for him. That's *his own* decision though.  For someone preaching so much individualism, seems you've become keen on what you think another entire collective body should do to fight their own oppression, because with one guy this one time it was successful.  

&gt;I get the feeling many in antifa refuse to honestly face that possibility, because they're not as concerned with the people they claim to be fighting on behalf of as they are with fulfilling a deep seated selfish need to feel radical and important. 

I really find your imposition of your characterization on people that are not you disturbing and arrogant.  This is why you come off as an awful person to me.  It's also why reddit sucks.  Poe's law.  

&gt;And the fact that you haven't addressed any of the contradictions and inconsistencies in your own reasoning just confirms my suspicion that there is no substantial philosophy underlying this shit

Theory v. Praxis man.  Theory only takes you so far.  And yeah, there's lots of work done regarding mass militant movements, but when it comes to an overarching social movement theory, it doesn't exist yet.  Most theorists would tell you there's definitely a time and place for violence.  Our bars are just different.  I think movements created to militantly stop other movements from starting that are genocidal is justified.  Especially when genocide is a stated goal.  

&gt;If this is supposed to represent what the left is, then please, by all means take away the moniker, I have no need for it.

645,"&gt;I mean, you realise that these neo-nazis are saying the same thing, that the State is allied with the left and it uses state sponsored violence to oppress them?

So what?  False equivalence.  Oppression against people whose stated goal is for things like racial purity is not a thing.  

&gt;and violently enforces affirmative action laws that make it illegal to discriminate in education and employment, or allows exceptions to increase the opportunities for minority groups.

I think we're done here if that is your view of how affirmative action works.  Obviously you are in denial of systemic oppression of POC's.  That's a non-starter.  You had me fooled that you were on the same side but it was only a tactical issue.  We aren't on the same side.  

&gt;but it's just as much allied with the left as it is with the right,

That is by definition not the case.  And another false equivalence.  

&gt;Would it change your opinion if it wasn't achieving its aim, but was actually having the opposite outcome? 

Based on zero research and only your hunch?  No, I'm not concerned about the opposite outcome happening.  It's counter-intuitive to say that driving ideas out of the mainstream of the marketplace will make them more popular.  

&gt;and this kind of violence, far from scaring off potential recruits, will more likely excite and attract them.

Again, this is a counter-intuitive argument based on no evidence and against any discursive analysis.  

Don't pretend like you're a leftist.  Your false equivalencies and advocacy against remedies to State violence and systemic oppression makes you ""Bro-gressive"" at best, reactionary at worse.  In another post you tokenize blacks as if befriending the Klan is an actual option for them to take.  Please, fly your ass to Syria and befriend ISIS and see what happens.  

There can be no doubt, that the actions the State takes in order to protect and remedy the systemic oppression of POC's and other marginalized groups pales in comparison to the inaction or action taken to kill them.

646,"The State continues to use state sponsored violence against POC's in this nation on a regular basis. But I think you're putting an arbitrary standard that only battling back against the state or state sponsored violence is justified.  

The neo-nazi group does not have to be a stand-in for the state.  It can be an ally in the complicity and planning of destruction of POC's, for instance.  The State allies with them when providing permits to spread hate and recruit people that have the intent of killing populations.  [The State allies with them when they fail to arrest leaders who assault POC's at political rallies](http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/violent-neo-nazi-rally-in-calif-organized-by-white-nationalist-who-shoved-black-woman-at-trump-event/). 

Additionally, not every action of previous movements were explicitly directed toward the state.  Sure, a good amount were, but targeting the Klan and other established racist groups (White citizens council is another good example).  

The Dylann Roof's of the world aren't created by the State.  They're created by people just like this.  

During Stonewall and Compton's Cafeteria, it's still not just the State going against LGBT communities, much like today it's not just the State.  The gains of the last 20 years do not occur without the violence that begins the movement.  The threat is not credible to those in power otherwise.  I could contend that millions more lives could have been saved if more violence occurred to push for AIDS research during the Reagan administration.  Then you end up in this position where you have to advocate for violence if you look to utility and maximum lives saved.  Even though that wasn't an active position of the State violently restricting LGBTs, but rather it was inaction in the face of disease.

690,"This legislation is awful as well as a great example of how systemic racism works.  

EDIT - since I""m getting the downvotes for mentioning racism, I'll explain more so I can get more downvotes.  This allows teachers to teach in DPS without having a certification from the state of Michigan.  It turns DPS into (even more) of a ridiculous shit-show that no other district has to do.  It restricts the ability of teachers in the state's blackest district their ability to strike, further clamping down on any will of the educational community to fight back against what the state is doing.  

No other district is treated like this.  Taken over by the state, run up huge deficits by the state, then changing the rules for the district so that inferior instructors can come in, and then having the audacity after spending all the district's money to ""loan"" it back to them.  That's some shit.  It is nothing less than educational apartheid.  

Rep Gay-Dagnogo is typically not the sharpest tool in the shed, but she's correct saying its ""separate and unequal"" in comparison to white districts.  Tonya Allen of Skillman totally smells where the money is coming from and where the wind is blowing and is giving tacit approval, showing that Skillman is far more about propping itself up monetarily than anything involving education of students.  

So, institutional racism?  I say yes, undoubtedly.  The institutions destroyed the schools in the black community, then made them functionally worse schools after this legislation by putting in less qualified educators.  Lesser educational opportunities will ensure the school-to-prison pipeline keeps on flowing.  There is no way this happens in a white district, ever.  Particularly the portion about bringing in uncertified teachers.  Every other district gets an elected school board.  The state literally booted the entire idea of an elected school board in favor of mayoral and governmental appointees.  Say what you will about the old board, there's certainly problematic folks that were on that board.  But the wholesale change of the structure is not how you change board members.  Not in a democracy, anyway.  ",2016-06-22 14:32:28+00:00,d4jed5w,1.0,t3_4p9q9s,20011.0,Michigan

HAHAHA!!  Yeah.  Ok.  Keep telling yourself that.  Remember when the police stood up for labor leaders when union rights were threatened?  Oh wait, they didn't.  Why?  Because they still had those rights. 

You think the police are going to stand up for YOU when they still have guns and you don't?  Trust me, for most cops, the LAST thing they want to see are people they pull over strapped.  (I come from a cop family.)  

As for the AR-15, the ONLY reason it's any good is reliability.  However, in comparison to a regular semi-auto handgun it's far more bulky, and when adrenaline is high you're more likely to trip and bump into shit with the AR than you are for a handgun.  And adrenaline will be very high.  Those situations are not the kind that people train for on a regular basis like a LE officer does or a military person does.  Retired military ain't gonna mean shit either if you don't keep your training going.

723,"I'll go one better and mix it with massive university corruption by the millions of dollars.


International students from certain middle eastern nations (Saudi, Jordan, Libya I think, some others) get sponsored scholarships from their home nation. So their nation pays for the schooling, and for every year they pay, the student owes 3 years of employment at an institution back in the home nation. (Which to a lot of US grad students seems pretty sweet because its a guaranteed job, but most int'l students race to finish because they don't want to make the dirt for money they'll get back home compared to the US).


So, school charges out-of-state tuition for these students. Now here is the kicker, for the graduate students that are TA's, their tuition is covered by the union contract at the school. They aren't responsible for that tuition. School doesn't bother to notify the home nation though, instead, they take the tuition money from the nation anyhow. They give none of that money to the TA, and just put it in the university's pocket.


TA then is stuck on the hook for 3 years of work for every 1 year they are in school at the university, even though the contract says their tuition is 100% covered.


Union rep tries to get one of them to file a grievance, any of them, we know of a few. Nobody will. Why? Department head says that if they stop the practice then they'll have to cut their jobs and deport them.

&gt;What may be the most important issue of our time, the rise of radical Islam

Refer to above regarding the devastation wreaked on humanity by cows.  

&gt;Some neighbors noticed suspicious activity but did not call the police, why?

Ohh, I don't know, maybe because there is nothing actionable.  Of course, even this lady hedges:

&gt;It's hard to say for sure..

No shit?

&gt;It's harder and harder to speak about these things without being told we are racist.

O RLY?  Please refer to thread.  It's actually quite easy to speak about these things if you actually speak about it *without being a fucking racist in how you speak about it.*

Now, you'll notice her little chart of ""violent Jihadists.""  Notice that they all seem to be in the same part of the world?  Hmmm.  Maybe there's some other correlation other than religion that she's failing to mention?  

&gt;It only takes a handful of terrorists to change the way a society operates. 

Indeed.  When a society is Islamophobic, then it only takes 1-2 to make that society act upon that Islamophobia, creating things like /r/The_Donald and other such hate groups.  

However, when a white Christian terrorist springs into action, shooting up a school, or blasting away at a federal building, we can't even get a gun control bill passed.  Does that seem a bit...odd?  Why is that?  Are white people just shitty at changing how a society would work?  Does Jesus hate white terrorism so he makes sure they don't succeed?  I'm certain it has to do with the religion, right?  Right??

&gt;And with the refugee crisis, the number of ISIS Jihadis operating in the West is also set to increase.

Based on what?  Nothing empirical.  ISIS pretty much hates the refugees.  

&gt; And according to reports, the mastermind of the Paris attacks snuck into Europe claiming to be a refugee.

&gt;Morici said that all of the nearly 9 million new jobs created since 2000 went to immigrants.

&gt;His numbers don’t add up. The study he cited linked to numbers that showed that immigrants accounted for about 70 percent of the net job growth. While that study’s headline was that all of the new jobs went to immigrants, that only held true for a certain age range, which Morici misapplied to all workers.

&gt;Morici is correct that foreign-born workers, both citizens and noncitizens, do disproportionately well in the job market. But the actual numbers fall well short of the 100 percent that he said. ""All"" is an overstatement.

&gt;There is an element of truth in the claim, but it ignores certain critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Now, try this, [a series of studies cited here -](http://www.businessinsider.com/immigrants-create-jobs-for-local-workers-2015-6) 

&gt;Using US Census data from 1980 to 2000, we find considerable evidence for these effects: Each immigrant creates 1.2 local jobs for local workers, most of them going to native workers, and 62% of these jobs are in non-traded services. Immigrants appear to raise local non-tradeables sector wages and to attract native-born workers from elsewhere in the country.

936,"The danger of this sort of thing brought to the general public, or worse the Reddit public (sorry in advance but I would advance the argument that there is a particular mindset that pervades Reddit that many call a ""hivemind"" or a ""circlejerk"") is that it will always be misconstrued.

I was at the finals round talked about in this episode.  I think this episode did give a portion of the opposing view, after all, they interviewed Arjun of Northwestern.  That isn't what the episode is about though.  The upset being felt is from a desire to preserve ""switch-side"" debate in the episode.  As if there is a duty to provide equal time.  But there isn't.  That is the nature of documentary itself.  

Documentary is not ""non-fiction"" at all.  It makes arguments, and then supports those arguments using narrative tools.  Radiolab also makes arguments, and supports them with narrative tools, storytelling, sound editing, etc.  

I don't believe that Rashad wanted them to be a caricature of themselves, quite the contrary.  They wanted them to be allowed to *be themselves.*  The argument they made was that debate should be a place where they could do that, and that a vote in affirmation would be to agree with that premise.  

When there is difficulty with the idea that the debate no longer was about the topic, there are a few reasons why that is ok sometimes in debate.  First, if debate itself is exclusionary and never starts on an equal playing field, then it's a prior question to the topic.  To have a debate, Northwestern and anyone else would say that you have to have equality going into the round, or one side always will start out losing.  (This is not to say that presumption doesn't exist for those debaters out there.)  If your style of debate is systematically excluded, then the ""fairness"" aspect that Northwestern argues for is already skewed in their favor.  Whether you believe that is true or not doesn't matter, that is an argument though and it has to be evaluated as one.  

Second, the debate often tells debaters to ""role-play"" the US Federal Government.  For Ryan and Elijah, that also means the playing field has been pushed against them before the round starts.  They could argue (I am pretty sure this came up in the round IIRC) that role playing a government that works to systematically oppress you as a person then that's likely a problem with debate as well, it doesn't allow you to be yourself as Rashad wants them to be.  

Also, there is the question of conviction.  Greene and Hicks article called ""Lost Convictions"" goes into this idea that switch-side debate may be a bad thing.  Dating back to the 50's where the US Military Academy refused to debate the topic ""That the USFG should diplomatically recognize the Republic of China"" because it was contrary to the military objectives of the US.  It's a good article and I just taught it in my debate class and we listened to this Radiolab the next class session.  

Listen though, also, I'm a white guy.  Ryan is a nice person.  Never was anything but kind when I had any interaction with him.  Arjun was one of my favorite debaters I ever had the privilege to judge.  Incredibly fast, incredibly clear, and very very persuasive.  I'm glad I wasn't on that NDT panel.  

Also, sorry in advance, don't expect me to get sucked into a debate.  I have work to do.  But was looking to see reactions.  Not surprised that the reactions here are like the Daily Caller or some other right wing outlet that reports on these things.  Self-interrogate, folks.  If you're in favor of having honest, switch-side, types of debates, start to try and orient yourself in the other position and make arguments for Ryan and Elijah in this forum.  At least then we could get some pedagogical value out of it, eh?

939,"People who use a colostomy bag are not abnormal.  I'm not sure how you get there.  

What is problematic is the idea that anything outside of mainstream seems to be ""abnormal"" in your eyes.  That doesn't make sense to me.  If I contract a cold virus, is that ""abnormal?""  Would it be ""abnormal"" to never contract a cold virus?  

By that evaluation too of what ""normality"" is, then is being black, latino, or any other race then ""abnormal?""  

Normal has connotative attachments to it can quickly become a problem.  Nakayama and Krisek did some great work talking about how ""whiteness"" is the ""normal"" that all other racial categories are compared to.  The same can be said for cis-ness.  In fact, the prefix ""cis"" was developed to avoid the idea that it was a norm.  When we label things as ""abnormal"" there is a connotation of deficiency.  Your example of the colostomy bag is excellent for showing that connotation.  ",2016-03-25 17:19:29+00:00,d1d7t4z,,t1_d19il23,,AskReddit

1038,"Trade and transactions are done with capital though.  So when capital flows leave an area, it makes it harder to function a business.  Businesses pay taxes.  So, what else happened..

The auto companies also fled the city.  Most factories relocated in the suburbs during the 50-70s and took the jobs with them.  Auto companies pay taxes.

Unions instituted ""seniority rules"" which had ""first in-last out""policies for layoffs.  Who were the ones most susceptible to layoffs?  Blacks because they were newer in the union.  So their jobless rate was always going to be higher when layoffs came.  Organizations like DRUM (Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement) and LRBW (League of Revolutionary Black Workers) had wildcat strikes to try and get equality for their workers as well as civil rights.  Walter Reuther responded by saying ""We're here to bargain contracts, not start revolutions.""  (Book reference is Detroit, I Do Mind Dying).  Life expectancy of black workers were also far lower because they would always be assigned the most dangerous jobs such as in foundries or paint rooms.  The conditions were so bad that when a black worker came and shot his foreman dead, jurors toured the plant and workplace and immediately granted him a temporary insanity plea because of the working conditions. 

As a result, blacks often lived in houses with larger numbers due to affordability.  You make the assumption that the property was not able to be maintained.  And yet, you don't indict the white people accepting the FHA loans for building new houses outside the city.  Why is that?  Why were white people not able to build their own communities without federal help?  That's a problem with how you framed the question.  

So I'm not biting on the suggestion that for some outside reason that blacks could not handle keeping up Detroit because they're black.  Oh, and don't get me started on S.T.R.E.S.S. and Mayor Cobo and Mayor Cavanagh.

1063,"I'm going to give a more lengthy answer, because this is a main focal point of my research.  If you want a decent history, get Tom Sugrue *The Origins of the Urban Crisis.*  It's likely one of the better histories. 

White flight began in the 1940's, around the time that the 2nd Great Migration of blacks from the South moved up for jobs in the industrialized North.  In 1943, there was a riot on Belle Isle in Detroit, where at the end of the day, 10,000 white people ended up going through the Black Bottom and Paradise Valley neighborhoods in Detroit and burning them (those were the black neighborhoods).  White residents began moving outside of the city as blacks moved in.  Many tactics were used by real estate agents to get whites to move out and sell their houses at incredibly cheap prices (see ""Blockbusting"") so they could take the house and resell it.  They played on fears of racial difference in order to reshape neighborhoods.  So many whites moved out, and took their money with them.

Enter ""Urban Renewal"" programs which had the stated purpose to revitalize urban areas and provide assistance to those who needed it in order to create an economically healthy area for everyone inside the city.  What happened was the federal government gave money for programs, but local officials decided how to enact the program.  This is when freeways were built using infrastructure money from the feds.  The freeways did two things, they split black neighborhoods in half by building literally on top of them, and they made it far easier for people who worked in the city to live elsewhere.  More whites moved out and took their money with them.  

The Federal Housing Administration had a program to provide loans to improve homes inside the city.  Black homes were those in the need of most help, but local officials did what was called ""redlining.""  They drew a big red line around the neighborhoods that would be considered a bad investment for the federal money because they were considered beyond repair.  And not coincidentally, that red line was drawn around black neighborhoods.  FHA loans though were approved for white people leaving the city to build homes in the suburbs.  So even more whites left taking their money and tax base with them.  

As a result of constant disadvantages, overzealous policing, and civil unrest, a rebellion took place in 1967, also known as the '67 riots.  The national guard was called in, many died, and more was destroyed.  And even more white people left, taking their money with them.  

The tide of flight is now not even restricted to white people.  Blacks who have the means also have been leaving the city as well.  Places like Southfield, Downriver, and other suburbs have been seeing an influx of middle class blacks too.  The collaboration of the State, economics, and racism is why there is a stark division between one side of 8 mile and the other on the border of Detroit.  This is not to say that since Detroit is majority black it is somehow ""worse looking"" because of their race, rather that the capital needed to maintain city services and the income needed to maintain storefronts, housing, etc, just does not exist. Additionally there is a cultural barrier to Detroit as well.  Even the word ""Detroit"" brings up imagery of not only the auto industry, but criminality.  I was at a suburban chamber of commerce meeting and people talked about how they would never, ever, do business in the city of Detroit, and some overheard them bragging about how long it had been since they even set foot in the city.  That is a pretty hard thing to overcome.",2016-03-01 19:13:13+00:00,d0joo2w,1.0,t3_48h20s,12144.0,Michigan

The rhetorical argument is more about persuasion toward contingent truths, rather than the claims of stability that logicians use. 

Another school would be the pragma-dialectic, primarily in Europe IIRC.  They view argument as a pursuit of truth, (not necessarily Truth, but getting closer to Truth).  Two interlocutors have to enter the argument situation with very open minds to decide which arguments are more correct, or synthesizing new theses at the end of arguments to be challenged again as they attempt to enhance their understanding of an issue.

1099,"Surprisingly from what I've found, you can find pretty good private sector jobs with an advanced rhetoric degree.  I knew some people in sales that were saying it was very sought after because of the ability to speak and make arguments.  I know, you are saying anyone can get a sales job, and you'd be right.  These were upper level sales, however, and the people were making really good money at the time.  

I am completing a PhD myself, I don't think I would have stopped at the Master's though.  Adjuncting I would consider a failure.  It's rough, the money is tight, the benefits barely existent.  One thing you'll find is that your cohort in the Master's program that do focus in rhetoric, are likely all anticipating finishing the PhD.  That may affect your decisionmaking later. 

You're coming from an English department section of rhetoric.  I would advise to possibly look at the Communication end for graduate school.  The job prospects in Comm (from my own limited experience) are going to likely be better than coming out with an English degree.  English departments seem a bit tougher to break into straight out, especially with just a Master's.  Also going into Communication, you could (and again, I'm not sure if I'm correct because I am not coming from English) likely be more interdisciplinary with some pretty hot fields in the area right now.  For instance, Health Communication PhD's are big right now.  And the rhetoric end is rich with new research (how do you teach a doctor to be effective in communicating to their patient that they need to fucking take all of that prescription?  Or quit smoking?)  Also I would imagine New Media (internet, social media, etc) would be big for both English and COM departments right now.  I always see job calls for them. 

Lastly, if you're going to go for it, bite the bullet and be able to teach research methods.  If you can teach quantitative methods as well as specializing in rhetoric, your job prospects likely just went up fivefold.  ",2016-02-15 03:40:15+00:00,d00a8il,1.0,t3_45ot2r,79475.0,Rhetoric
1100,"I want to riff off of your Thomas Kuhn reference.  Remember that paradigm shifts occur because there are enough anomalies that go against a prevailing way of thinking that there becomes a demand for a shift to happen.  

For the collective, because of so many minds working together at once, the amount of anomalies would have to be vast in number.  At the same time, many in the collective could be working to fit the anomalies into the existing paradigm while many others could possibly be working on a new theory to accommodate anomalies.  

That may explain their difficulty in finding new solutions to problems.  Paradigm shifts could occur rapidly with the assimilation of a new species, and that would be the reliable way to come up with ways to account for anomalies.  Rather than try to figure out a new solution on its own (something that I think the Collective is likely quite capable of) instead the more efficient solution is just to assimilate a new species that may have the answer to the problems.  

Seven's strength of being unlocked then, she views as a weakness because while she may be able to take more scientific risks, it would be seen by her as more inefficient than simply assimilating the information needed.

1106,"&gt;Rather like the situation with riding the wrong way against traffic, there is no specific crash type reserved for bicyclists riding on the sidewalk. However, the fact that the bicyclist was on the sidewalk is a contributing factor in a great many crashes at intersections.

&gt;• Motorist turns left in front of cyclist: 42% of bicyclists are on the sidewalk 

&gt;• Motorist turns left into oncoming cyclist: 15% of bicyclists are on the sidewalk

&gt;• Motorist turns right into bicyclist: 31% of bicyclists are on the sidewalk

&gt;• Motorist drives out of alley/driveway: 48% of bicyclists are on the sidewalk

&gt;• Motorist drives through intersection: 15% of bicyclists are on the sidewalk

&gt;• Bicyclist rode out intersection with signal: 24% of bicyclists are on the sidewalk

&gt;Once again, the perception is that someone is safer riding on the sidewalk than on the road—and many motorists and even law enforcement officers repeat that message. The problem is that, as the numbers above suggest, bicyclists are not safer on the sidewalk
because they become almost invisible to the motorist. When a driver turns, either left or right, or into a driveway or alley, they are simply not looking for, or expecting to encounter, a bicyclist. And even if they do look and see a bicyclist they may still underestimate the speed a rider is traveling on the sidewalk - because it will likely be much faster than a pedestrian. 

Bicyclists getting hit by a car trying to overtake them from behind is the least likely scenario of an accident.  However, put them on the sidewalk and you've increased their chances of getting hit by 1.8x

&gt;Bicyclists on a sidewalk or bicycle path incur greater risk than those on the roadway (on
average 1.8 times as great), most likely because of blind conflicts at intersections. Wrongway
sidewalk bicyclists are at even greater risk, and sidewalk bicycling appears to increase

1200,"Rhetoric instructor here, maybe this will add some context. 

They don't *need* to know the events and stories that the metaphors are based on.  The metaphor has its own meaning.  Think on it this way, all language is already a symbolic representation of things.  We do not qualify things like ""tree"" as to what the tree *is.*  Rather, when we define words like ""tree"" we define it by excluding what the tree is *not.*  We put qualifiers on the tree like ""plant"" which means ""not animal.""  The word is only a representation, and can never positively *be* the thing being represented.

The same would go for the Tamarian metaphors.  Darmok across the ocean is not in actuality representing Darmok across the ocean.  And it is not in actuality relaying the story of Darmok going across an ocean.  The meaning and symbol changed to suit the needs of the Tamarians.  Just like ""sinister"" today is not the Latin root of ""left handed.""  Rather ""sinister"" means something totally different.  I do not need to know the Latin root in order to understand what ""sinister"" means today.  

Think of the metaphors in this case to be words with multiple meanings that make sense in a particular context, just like our language does.

You are correct regarding the contract.  The 35 year contract expired in 2000.  The decision to switch to KWA made Detroit send notice of termination in a year as the contract allowed.  Purchase of water for a short term would have been likely 10% higher for the rate.  Purchase under a new 30 year contract would have been much less than KWA was going to charge.

Highlights:

&gt;Howard Croft, the former director of public works for Flint who resigned in November 2015, asserted more than four months ago in a videotaped interview with the ACLU of Michigan that the decision to use the dangerously corrosive river came directly from the Snyder administration.
&gt;In the interview, Croft said that the decision to use the river was a financial one, with a review that “went up through the state.”

&gt;“All the way to the governor’s office?” the ACLU of Michigan asked him.

&gt;“All the way to the governor’s office,” Croft replied.

&gt;Detroit did terminate a 50-year contract but it also diligently tried to strike a new deal to keep selling Flint clean, safe water. Earley rejected all offers and then sent that “thanks but no thanks” letter to Detroit saying that the decision had been made to use the Flint River.


&gt;In a letter obtained by the ACLU of Michigan (PDF), emergency manager Darnell Earley wrote to DWSD in March 2014:
&gt;“Thank you for the correspondence that provides Flint the option of continuing to purchase water from the city of Detroit. … The City of Flint has actively pursued the Flint River as a temporary water source… There will be no need for Flint to continue purchasing water to serve its residents and businesses after April 17, 2014.”

I'm not sure what else you need other than an actual letter from the Earley to DWSD saying they would be getting water from the river rather than DWSD.

1230,"I have thought about this before, and a couple of things that I like to think is unique to the human melee style (head canon).  First, Starfleet training in hand-to-hand is not only about certain moves to use in general, but knowing the places/combinations to hit for *each species.*  That is what gives humans, not an edge, but a fighting chance against species like Klingons with 3x the strength.

We see humans beat Klingons, but we seldom see them beat Vulcans.  That is because Vulcans have the type of training that would likely counter human moves.  While Klingon training is to increase endurance to come up from a hit, and to do as much damage as quicky as possible.  Unless we're talking bat'leth, in which it is an art form, but not necessarily strategic.  

The other thing is that when a human is back against a wall, the adrenal gland makes them much tougher.  Yes, other aliens have adrenal glands, but I think of Quark's quote about humans in *The Seige of AR-558,*

1274,"The answer about Flint being ""cut off"" from Detroit water and being forced to use the Flint River is answered here, among other explanations from the state. 

&gt;Nowhere in that vote or other votes did Flint City Council say, ""We support getting water from the Flint River."" Yes, there was one councilman who did openly support that. But as a board, that vote never happened. Flint leaders never made that call (not that they had the authority to make such a call at that time anyway.)

&gt;Some state officials continue to confuse Flint’s vote to join the Karegnondi Water Authority with the state appointed emergency manager’s decision to temporarily switch to the Flint River.

This looks like a lot of comments in some threads on this issue.

&gt;April 2013: State treasury officials approve Flint’s move to join KWA. The same month, Detroit sends Flint a letter announcing Detroit would end Flint’s long term contract to buy water, citing a legal clause in the contract. Many times, spokespersons for Michigan’s Treasury Department, the Governor’s Office, and even Flint’s emergency managers themselves have erroneously claimed this is the point where Detroit “cut Flint off” from the water supply. Yes, Detroit notifies Flint it will give the city one year at the long term contract rate structure, but after that, it would need to negotiate another contract. The other, shorter term options were more expensive than the longer term deal. Detroit, by no means, kicked Flint off its water system, as many state officials have claimed.

1319,"&gt;If you want to discuss the fundamentals of economics, I'd be happy to.

I would rather not for a couple of reasons.  Anytime someone says ""That's econ 101,"" typically they ignore that Econ 401 exists.  Also, economics is more of an art than a science.  Gather 5 economists in a room, ask them about the direction of the economy over the next 6 months, and you'll get 5 different answers (6 if one of them went to Harvard).  

&gt;The State had minimal fault for Flint's financial distress.

That's a claim without a warrant.  If you'd like to discuss the fundamentals of argumentation I'm pseudo qualified and would love to help you.  It's like you just denied the existence of the cuts to state revenue sharing (not to mention the recent elimination of the PPT which heavy industry reliant places like Flint and Detroit took in a significant amount for their budgets as well).  

You overclaim the effect of taxes and undersell the effect of infrastructure and population to business attraction.  Considering that many businesses that create jobs get a hefty tax abatement anyhow to attract them, the additional mills don't mean as much as you'd indicate.  However when GM has to ship in water because the water is corroding their parts, that's on the balance sheet.  

But its economics.  You could be right, you could be wrong.  There is no certainty in the subject.  As I said previously, it's based in perspective far more than any empiricism.

If a kid wanted to go watch women in the bathroom, they could do that in the status quo anyhow by hiding in a stall.  They would not have to claim another gender.  Even if they did, once they stared at a woman in the restroom, that whole thing would be stopped instantly.

It is basically a party bus company now and occasionally does other types of trips.  Mostly its corporate junkets to ""explore Detroit"" from scared out of towners.  

He tried running a bus line to the DTW airport (there was none) but couldn't make that financially feasible either. 

Privatization promoters lauded him as the next big thing and could provide transit services cheaper than public buses.  It not only couldn't be done, but it failed so miserably at it that the bus unions and public bus system never even really had to fight over the fact that trunk lines and bus routes are legally monopolized by the government. 

Andy isn't a bad guy, don't get me wrong.  But to characterize the bus company as some charity is just grossly incorrect.  He's an affluent young man who has done some good things, but caught some backlash on the marketing of the bus company at first.  Eventually he stopped with the ""Such a good community benefit"" schtick and called it what it was.

I think the Royals will not only regress, but pretty significantly regress.  Single hit parades aren't going to be as common for them as they were this year.  

The Indians are a big threat too, I agree with what you're saying about their pitching.  Their batting was just ugly, but I don't think their talent was overall really that bad, it just was a down year for a lot of guys.  They did pick it up by the end.  A couple guys having a career year could make them very scary.

1475,"Depends on where the seats are.  I have had a 28 game package for ... 4 or 5 years now?  My seats though are in the lower deck behind the bullpen.  Pretty good seats so easy to get rid of through friends mostly.  

But every so often I would give a pair away because it was like a thursday day game or something where it's harder to get the 9-5ers to go.

The best part, go to every possible game. You'll end up getting to know the people in the section around you.  I ended up basically quitting golf because 28 games is constant entertainment all summer long. 

AND, you are on the 3rd wave for playoff tickets.  (Full season ticketholders, then half season, then 28 games).  If you are online at the correct time, you can get decent seats in the outfield or any lower deck before anyone else.  However, the tip, is you need to buy the playoff STRIP.  Which means you need to front the money to buy every game all the way through the World Series.  Yes, it's a bundle, but whatever games aren't played they pay you back for.  And it's WAY easier to get rid of playoff tickets (at a reasonable profit) than it is for the regular season.  

And when you get the strip, you get the fancy pictured tickets instead of that printout crap.  

Lastly, I""m not sure if its for new people, but if I renew my full package by the 30th, I get 10(?) passes to the Tiger Club.  So that's nice I think, but I usually can get up there regardless.

1579,"The Federation has a problem with Ferengi because of humanity's arrogance.  Hu-mans see themselves as having 'evolved beyond' the ideas of capitalism and all of the trouble it had causes mankind.  They see it as an antiquated notion that destroyed elements of community necessary for humanity's continued evolution. 

And they are right, humanity could not move forward under such a system.  Hu-man compassion and care for others made it difficult to continue justifying ""Sanctuary Districts"" and regional coalitional military partners in constant warfare.  

The Ferengi though, sees that as humanity's weakness, and their primitive nature.  They could not handle the economic system without 3 world wars, for instance.  Sure, Ferenginar has some drawbacks, it's treatment toward women some find distasteful.  The swindling of people is seldom regulated (that is, swindling of people who aren't Ferengi..).  But is that any worse than the colonizing and military force that the Federation with its ""Prime Directive of Convenience"" lives by?  A Ferengi could make some pretty good arguments that the insidious nature of the Federation makes them no angels of the galaxy.  

That arrogance and looking down on the Ferengi Alliance likely made first contact a rough go. ",2015-11-20 04:58:24+00:00,cx6lfwe,1.0,t3_3tbfx0,127786.0,DaystromInstitute

1616,"&gt;The problem I have with your hypotheticals is that it's through the typical black-or-white lens; either everything is OK or everything is not OK.

This is the crux of the problem with all the 1st Amendment defenses.  People want to say that it is sacrosanct and that any disciplinary action for speech should be rescinded on face.  But that's not how the real world works.  We have to make judgement calls *all the time* regarding speech.  

We do not have to hold a Klan rally at a university if we don't want to.  Now is that a restriction on free speech?  Absolutely.  But this claim that all ideas have to be allowed and summarily challenged on campuses put us in a state of paralysis.  

Imagine you're a mathematician, and rather than investigating or researching possibilities for new theorems, we have to have some ongoing debate on the realities of two and two equaling four.  It is a distraction from moving forward.  We have to be able to make the judgments about what is a valid argument and what arguments are just ""over.""  Academics would not get published rehashing arguments already considered resolved by the community.  

Allowing equal footing for all arguments on college campuses is anti-educational.  Universities aren't in the business of promotion of anti-educational arguments.  

I know, who makes those judgment calls?  Well, seeing that the university is an educational institution where knowledge is produced, I would say they would make the judgment as to what is and isn't anti-educational.  But I'm sure there are other opinions on that front.  The point is, 1st Amendment rights don't entitle someone to spread potential hate just because a smattering of money goes to the institution.

1648,"&gt;Why would they betroth / bond two people as children? That surely just complicates matters, as this episode proves, because who knows what the two people are going to be doing are wanting later in life. Surely there's a more logical and organized way to handle the necessary mating of pon farr.

Except that arranged marriage is highly logical, actually.  In a system where emotional love is deemed illogical, it makes lots of sense to have marriages arranged.  

Looking at cultures in present day earth, there are some pretty good arguments that arrangement of marriage makes a lot of sense to those brought up with a more collectivist mindset.  I'm talking about arranged, not forced, and that is a distinction to be made.  But this is a life decision that would hopefully be made only once, and last for decades.  Why would you trust such a decision with the young?  Why would not entire families with their collective wisdom help to make the pairing of two people the best possible?  

Granted, these traditions predate Surak, but it makes lots of logical sense to at least keep the arranged marriage aspect post revolution.  

Also, purging of emotion for logic never ever precluded cultural traditions.  I think a lot of people get lost on that point and assume that ""logic"" means being solely some kind of computer with no creativity.  That is not the case.  Vulcan music exists.  Vulcan literature (fiction even!) exists.  So ceremonies and rituals are logical as they are a preservation and celebration of culture.  To just strip ritual from a culture would be far more illogical because it would be to strip identity from their race.",2015-11-10 22:02:16+00:00,cwvt58g,1.0,t3_3sanen,16679.0,DaystromInstitute

Notice though, nobody bothered to examine what that goal is to be in favor of cultural appropriation.  Rather, they just threw the 'ole downvote in.  Which is a form of silencing of an opinion they don't like.

Phil Coke.

He was a Yankee who left the evil empire to come to the Tigers, and took more flack than about anyone in the bullpen.  At the same time, typically his statistics were better than any lefty coming out of the pen (no big feat for the Tigers, but hey..).  He was there to lead the team to a World Series by taking over the closer role *mid-postseason* and brought us the best [mitt-spiking gif possibly of all time.](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1254941/coke.gif?_ga=1.11394612.141692542.1446692847) 

I could go on about his exploits on the mound, but it's his personality and idiosyncrasies that make me truly appreciate the guy.  [Yes, he sprints out to the mound.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPb291JdQwA)  He also will spray the fans down with a big hose from the bullpen on hot days at Comerica.  He gives amazing interviews about[ striking out Miguel Cabrera while impersonating him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GDPRQ7bos)  He also is the guy who probably signed more autographs than anyone.  Really there for the fans, [even if he hits them in the nuts with a baseball by mistake...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQvo4-fLmFs).

1723,"I think OP's original question though was about the endgame.  So, the Founders are killed by the disease and the whether the Vorta can continue Ketracel White production seems like a dubious prospect.  What happens then?

The Jem'Hadar are able to lead each other, and take advanced tactics without the help of the Founders, but it would certainly be in a ""last throes"" situation.  The Vorta would not likely have much control over the Jem'Hadar as they may have had previously.  But the Vorta are a crafty bunch.  They might be able to take advantage of splits in the Alpha Quadrant (Could they convince the Romulans to ally with them and the Breen and Cardiassians and use the last parts of the Jem'Hadar for an offensive?).  Relations with the Cardassians would need major repair, but I'm sure the genocidal attacks on Cardassia Prime would have hurt matters.  I suppose that there is no way that would have gone differently, since the disease was in play when all that went down, but the alliances of the Cardassians would still be in question under a new leader because the people responsible for the genocide (Founder) would no longer be there. 

For Section 31, the endgame is a power vacuum in the Gamma Quadrant.  That vacuum allows Federation traders to extend their hegemony into a new quadrant.  Expect larger regulations on shipping and travel through the wormhole to ensure no other empire gets the influence that the Federation would have in the Gamma Quadrant.  With no Dominion to be concerned about, the Ferengi also would likely make a lot of inroads there as well.  

Romulans want to use the wormhole?  Well, we'll just have to scan those ships for contraband.  I would expect that rather than mining the wormhole entrance, that there would instead be a way-station of sorts to make sure that there are no military adventures (other than Section 31 and Starfleet of course) headed to the other end of the wormhole.  It would likely cause major shifts of power in the Alpha Quadrant as a result, but that's where I think Section 31's head is at.  Cause chaos in the Gamma Quadrant, so the Federation can swoop in to bring order.",2015-10-27 22:45:12+00:00,cwf6jtv,1.0,t3_3qg3jk,17872.0,DaystromInstitute

It's gotten to the point where a friend has recently published a book entitled [""How To Live In Detroit Without Being A Jackass.""](http://beltmag.com/live-detroit-without-jackass/) (Shameless plug for Aaron Foley..lol)  

The ""Detroit is a blank slate"" thing was said by Phil Cooley, a person who runs a BBQ shop in Detroit.  Don't get me wrong, Phil is much more self-aware than he was then.  But back then, yeah, it grated on a lot of people who said that kind of statement literally erases all the people who were in the city during the tougher times.

The [young white entrepreneurial](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/white-entrepreneurial-guy) ""enlightened"" people from high end universities making their way to the city and saying rhetorically damaging phrases like ""Detroit is a blank slate!"" or ""You can do ANYthing here..!"" captures the idea of a city with serious urban issues to be treated as a playground for young people who have no appreciation for the history and the culture that already exists there. 

Bashir is exactly this person.  He has no concerns for Bajor, or what they might want.  He is the explorer looking to make a name for himself, to be the hero.  He is the person who ""discovers"" Bajor, or America, or Detroit, with no appreciation for those that had lived there generations.  The idea that the enlightened Federation still can make the same mistakes of colonization that was made by many people before him rings very true for me.  Often the worst sins of colonialism are committed by those who are ""only there to help"" or ""educate"" in a respect that the culture existing in that place becomes subservient to the new order coming in.  

I mention Detroit because that is close to my personal experience, but it's the same story with many places that colonialist powers had invaded.  It's good that Bashir ends up learning lessons about this later, but if I remember correct, there are times where he cannot comprehend why certain alien cultures think differently than him regarding life, death, medicine, and the promises of technology.

1846,"I think you may be overestimating the capabilities of genetic engineering for the Founders.  Creation of a species seems unlikely to have been what was done by the Founders.  Rather, they more likely started with a species that had been taken over and altered their genetics from there.  

That being said, those alterations are not as sophisticated as Suliban technology which was delivered from the future.  Playing with genetics is not some simple ""flip a switch and you get antennae"" type of endeavor.  The calculations that are necessary to make an alteration in code would be monumental, and to create new code even more so.  Remember we only recently mapped the human genome, and it took years to do.  We still don't know what everything on that map does at this point.  

The creation of appendages from scratch genetically would be a task beyond the technology of the Founders.  Starfleet stopped making small alterations because of the damage possible.  The Augments were not dangerous because they were ""too good.""  Rather, the Augments were dangerous because it was genetic engineering that had failed.  

Another huge indicator that the Founders abilities were limited when it came to genetic engineering is how outclassed the Jem'Hadar was in hand to hand combat against a Klingon with no genetic alterations.  Worf in the ring with a Jem'Hadar meant numerous Jem'Hadar got rekt.  Natural evolution will create mutations that enhance selection over millions of years that are far more effective in the long run as demonstrated by Worf and others.

That's not even scratching the surface of the arguments against gentrification.  You've oversimplified greatly.

Huh?  No.  If you're forced out of an area first you're paying for relocation.  Second, the services garnered from increased tax base don't necessarily reach the new location (and often don't).  Suppose I'm forced out and move to Southfield.  How does Detroit's tax base provide services for me?

**TL/DR** could be said for Bravo in regards to this report.  

What is important here is that this alleged ""takedown"" does absolutely nothing to dispute the information provided in the report.  Some of the citations could be better done, sure.  But in no way does this invalidate anything said.  And certainly there is no case for some kind of ""dishonesty"" in how this is prepared.  The report isn't selling itself based on the number of citations, never had.  It only says information and cites the information accordingly.  There is no scoreboard for amount of citations in a report.  Overfocus on this is a major flaw in this article.  ",2015-09-27 08:28:04+00:00,cvfmr49,2.0,t1_cvfmqyv,20.0,AgainstGamerGate
1870,"Response to the exaggerated citation issues brought about by one ""Jaime Bravo"" if that's his real name..
First, before starting, I would like to mention that any types of indicts of bias coming from a person who writes exclusively in defense of GamerGaters is laughable. Pot, meet kettle.

Moving on. I cannot believe I'm actually doing this work, but it's Saturday night, I just got back home from going out.

First indict - #3, takes issue with the definition of doxing. This is not a citation. It is an endnote. It is to give context to the reader who may not know what doxing is. This is actually, not improper. Taking issue with it being from Wiki I can understand, however, there is no real problem with the definition provided even according to Mr. Bravo's standards. So this doesn't ""prove"" anything. Let's keep it going -

 #6 - same deal. This is an endnote. Endnotes are not bound to be citations. Often, they are .. well .. notes. To bring context to what is provided in the text. Charges of plagiarism may or may not be valid, but again, and this will be important in the rest of this, it does not undermine the argument being laid out.

 #8, for some reason it's bad to use the same citation twice? What? How can you complain about plagiarism in one citation and then say that using the same one twice is not valid? This doesn't make sense. The word ""ibid"" exists for a reason.

 #9 - Same thing. News flash, you're ""allowed"" to use the same citation more than once. I have no idea what his protest is with this. It's like he never wrote a paper before.

 #11 - he invalidates a source because the word ""Women's"" is in the title when the pdf he found did not have that. Ignoring the Freudian issues going on here, when this report was presented, it may have had that title at the conference, I don't know, I wasn't there. The point being, the pdf is typically made after reports like this are presented. Again though, not invalidating the source at all with this one. Just a gripe over title. This is not a peer reviewed paper though. His standards are oddly high on citation here. Especially considering he easily found the report.

 #15 - the Rifkin quote. Perhaps misquoted, perhaps an issue with translations. Rifkin does say that ""Culture is the sphere where we socialize ourselves"" in The Zero Marginal Cost Society. Again, Jaime says this is simply ""not valid"" but doesn't undermine any argument being made. Rifkin does say this regarding culture. As for the rest of the quotation, I'm not sure. Rifkin writes a lot of things. As much as I don't have a lot to do tonight, reviewing all the works of Jeremy Rifkin and his tofu sandwiches is not going to be on the agenda. Suffice it to say that Jaime is immediately writing everything off just by saying ""invalid.""

 #16 - again an LOL moment where Mr. Bravo cannot comprehend why endnotes have notes in them.

 #18, which Bravo claims as ""sneaky."" (For some reason it's sneaky to reference the bibliography in the endnotes? I thought he wasn't critiquing based on APA/MLA/Chicago styles?) Read the article. p. 409. Done. Again, not a dispute of the argument.

 #22 - Actually, saying that you got the citation via a website that was not the original work is very right, not wrong. This is not uncommon. They do not make a claim to cite the original work, which is why they say where they received the statistics from. This is even more common when citing a conference presentation, which has a peer review process but often is not at the publication stage. This however is accessible via this link[1] - and we see the statistics are not incorrect. The only thing that is ""completely dishonest"" is Jaime Bravo's characterization in this situation.

 #23 - it's cited separately because the summary has multiple sources to it on their facts and figures. They wouldn't cite Bridges to reference things Bridges didn't say.

 #25 - This criticism is pretty much the problem with Jaime Bravo's view of the world. If it doesn't have a URL, then the study somehow may not exist. Regardless, this DOES exist and the APA/MLA style that he says he's not critiquing does not call for a URL when it's citing an academic journal. Dang, why did you even address #25 when you're just so wrong on it?

 #27 - he says the link is broken. It works for me. Buy a better computer.

 #32 - the link isn't actually broken, it's just too specific and is referencing when it was recorded. The internet live stats link still works. For all the ""extra work"" he's claiming on other citations, this was probably the easiest fix ever that I guess slipped through his fingers. He did not even read to see what was being cited and the context, he just clicked the link and said ""broken"" without realizing what was being done with a live updating site.

 #38 - see above on Rifkin. (Yes, I just cited myself, holy shit throw me to the wolves now).

 #39 isn't even a reasonable gripe. ""I cannot verify it, but the book exists.."" What? So you're pretty much saying you didn't bother to read anything in the citations but you're willing to just cast doubt for no real reason. Why am I spending this much time even bothering to refute you then? Jesus what's wrong with me? Now I'm pot-invested so ONWARD!

 #40 - I like how it's now ""has no valid material to work with."" Rifkin is kinda a prolific author, whether you agree or disagree with his writing. Regardless, see above on Rifkin. Suffice it to say, yes, I'd like to know the writing referenced, but it's not like the monthly user statistic of how many people use Twitter is being disputed or of consequence if it's off by a few million.

 #42 - it's a typo. Actually ""statista.com"" rather than statistica. Found the link in less then 2 minutes.[2]

 #46 - now this is funny. The infamous C: citation. But the title of the study was included! And googling the title had it come up at this link - http://www.cybervictims.org/CCVCresearchreport2015.pdf[3]

 #49 - not a citation, rather a note, which is allowed in ""endNOTES."" Google Amanda Todd, the case is pretty well known.

 #51 - this isn't misleading. It's just not a direct quotation. If an idea is not your own to take credit for, then you credit where you found the information. Bro, I know Medium.com doesn't have a super strict citation policy, so I guess I'll give you a pass for not knowing.

 #53 - less than 10 seconds to find the Hughes article.[4]

 #56 - This isn't ""not valid"" because it's the same source. Should it have been the same title? Perhaps. But not invalid somehow because it's the same one.

 #61 See Rifkin stuff above. But if Bravo was actually checking in the report while doing this, he'd notice (and likely yell bloody murder) that #61 isn't even in the report. It skips from 60-62.

 #63 - another one where for some reason re-using a source makes it invalid.

 #64 - is he somehow questioning the source authority of the UN Council on Women?  From Jaime Bravo?  

 #66 - What?  [Link isn't broken](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/4096561/heartmob/description).  Get better wifi?

 #67 - this line that recurs is rapidly becoming my favorite.  It represents 3 things at once.  First, the literal message of the citation being valid, second, the whole begrudging attitude toward that being the case, and third, the naive worldview that online information is somehow better than a published book.  ""Though this is not available online, it does appear to exist.""  You know, it's not available online, so it's substandard but it at least exists..  A laugh riot.

 #70 - fount the Citron article and page previously, but I go a step further.  #70 is cited incorrectly.  It is sourced within the text correctly.  Unsure why Citron is mentioned here but then I dug into the name a little more.  The citations are likely coming from her book,[ *Hate Crimes in Cyberspace*](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674368293).  Another check revealed that this book was cited in #120.  We'll get to that later. 

 #72 - The link looks like this - http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/handbook/Handbook%20for%20legislation%20on%20violence%20against%20women.pdf.  Yeah, they shortened it or it changed.  Yeah, that doesn't make the report or its content not exist.  

 #75 - blank number likely an intended ibid, but still yeah that's kinda not good right there.. 

 #76 - There is no reason that this would not ""count.""  The link changed, the information did not, and the information exists in print form.  Just totally arbitrary and again showing bias toward digital content.

 #77 - not really.  I would not have expected Bravo to actually read both articles, and I was not let down as he didn't even read the UN report.  #77 is a direct quote from the Hess article.  Thus, it's linked to Hess.  #76 includes other stories besides Hess and mentions them all in a general trend.  Two separate pieces of information.  Two separate citations.  

 #80 - It is conceivable that the people compiling the report did the interview.  The citation is a direct quote.  

  #81 - see Citron references, likely her book.

 #83 - yep, I can't find Halter either.  

 #86 - this is an edited volume.  The two sources are because Smith and Steffgen edited a book consisting of multiple authors.  One chapter written by Spears, and the other bibliographic entry for the book itself (possibly an introduction or chapter written by the editors).

1871,"1.  The purpose of the report is not to present original research.

2.  I've already read the medium articles, and all they do is attack citations, not any of the arguments made.  (And the idea that the UN for some reason cannot cite itself is kinda laughable.  Tons of actual academic papers do this, and this is not even intended to be an academic paper).  I mean, as if people don't know who Jeremy Rifkin is?  (Maybe you don't, but many people do, he's a popular guy.)  

I still post the question that I'm wondering what OP, and attackers of the report, are truly trying to hang onto by trying to undermine the UN in this case.  What is their goal here?  Why the huge backlash?  That is where the real fun begins. 

EDIT - Not to mention the best part.  Someone complaining about citations who has absolutely zero credentials himself, and then being cited as a reputable source.  This is meta-madness.  All this ""author"" does is write defenses of gamergate.  And then he goes and gets mad about the ""bias"" of the UN report.  My sides, they are splitting.

If RTW proponents know that it is unfair to force a union to represent people that freeload on dues, then they should be first lobbying the US Congress before intentionally hurting the collective organizations of workers.  Otherwise, it is not about choice, because it forces a collective bargaining organization to have no choice but to represent people who do not pay for the cost of representation through agency fees.  

Until that change is made, it is an incredibly valid argument as to why RTW laws are unfair.

I could change that height section right now seeing that all the other pitchers mentioned don't clear 20-25 feet, but it's generally accepted that they throw an eephus.  El Duque's eephus didn't come close to the height mentioned either.

Black people protest crime [all](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/black_community_is_concerned_with_black_on_black_crime_suggesting_otherwise.html) [the](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/04/why-dont-black-people-protest-black-on-black-violence/255329/) [time.](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/04/08/1376496/-Why-don-t-black-people-protest-black-on-black-violence).  Choosing to ignore those protests against crime is something white people (and some black people like Peggy Hubbard) love to do in order to blame black people for police brutality.

Look, the crime rate [has been falling](http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/15/opinions/jones-police-brutality/) over the past decade like crazy.  But police brutality seems to be on the rise.  Actually, it's likely less on the rise and more being recorded because of protestors.  

The distraction, is when white people (and black people so devalued that they actually believe the racist narrative) that black on black crime should be paid more attention and that we literally should look away from police brutality.  That is definitively saying that we should no longer protest civil servants who kill and lie about it.

2251,"Star Trek in the time of Star Trek can still be a futuristic sci-fi adventure, but it will have more of a basis in reality. 

Take the example of the Temporal Cold War.  There were many views of what the future of the Federation and the galaxy looked like.  Writers of fiction in the time of Star Trek get a glimpse of what that future entails, but also does not exactly know all the details and gets to write their own storylines.  

Imagine that what is known about the future as canon, and writers of sci-fi become beta canon.  The opportunity to write about how the new technologies that exist in the future could be used, and the alien threats and menaces of the future are handled by our own future selves would be the equivalent of stories and YouTube series using Star Trek as a launching pad.  

**Writer in the time of Enterprise:**  Writes stories about the rise of the Sphere Builders.  Inserts their backstory.  Perhaps a series about a singular Sphere Builder trying to go against the grain of their race and ally with the Federation to undermine the efforts of the Xindi and their race.  

**Writer in the time of TNG:**  Tracks a parallel universe Enterprise D, where Picard is dead, the Federation is losing a war against the Klingons and Romulans, and Riker is the captain struggling to survive.  Think TNG meets Year of Hell.  

**Writer in the time of Voyager:**  Explores more about the older Kes, writes a story akin to *Wicked* where we find out what caused the aged Kes to become so bitter and lose her memory of why she left Voyager. 

Basically, I'm saying the possibilities are endless still, but because of time travel and having brief views of the future there is a way to put a solid basis underneath every story.  ",2015-08-19 19:11:01+00:00,cu8lb1i,1.0,t3_3hl0qi,19448.0,DaystromInstitute

2531,"I would want a DS9 to feature the return of the Emissary.  He's back, and he's pissed off.  The Sisko throwing lightning bolts at the enemies of Bajor.

The problem is that the Dominion was vanquished.  There would have to be a new Cardassian threat find a worthwhile enemy, ~~but with Damar running Cardassia, he would have to be assassinated in order to make them an enemy again.~~  EDIT - Corrected by /u/ACAFWD  below, Damar already was killed retaking Cardassia from the Dominion.  D'oh!

There is the possibility of a rising Breen threat that could make things interesting as a potential villain.  They would transition into a motion picture quite well too.  With the redemption of the founders, it's possible the Vorta would be cast out, looking for people to serve.  The Breen could have taken over facilities of the Jem'Hadar with the help of the Vorta to become a new Alpha Quadrant threat.  But the Sisko would have none of it.  Cruising around in Defiant, with a radiant supernatural glow around the ship being far more powerful than just deflector shields and ablative armor.  Sisko would be a weapon that Starfleet also could not really control.  The conflict between being Starfleet and being 'of Bajor' would resurface.  As Sisko fights the Breen war on his own, Section 31 tries to eliminate Sisko because he is too dangerous and cannot be controlled by the Federation.

Now the Tigers don't have a farm system at all anymore and the pitching is endless tears and consternation.  I am happy to be a part of an entirely new form of tears and consternation here in Miami!

2735,"Thanks for the explanation.  And you're right, it might not split up that minority.  But the result has to be a district where the minority voting bloc would be able to elect their own rep.  And if there's a population that is significant enough to have two districts with minority blocs, then that is a constitutional interest according to VRA.  

So like this - if you had a district where you need 600k people in it, and you have 500k black population in a compact area, putting them all into one district is not the ideal.  Rather you'd split that population so that two districts can have a minority voting bloc.  Which is what happens in Detroit currently.

&gt;As split-line strives to create geographically compact districts, even if imperfectly, this point may be hard to prove.

What point?  The person protesting a split-line map would simply say it does not meet the VRA on the idea that there is a minority population that does not have a dedicated district in the particular map.

2737,"&gt;Unless split-line unintentionally disenfranchises minority voters (I can't see why it would)

Because if it's totally color-blind, then that's often how minorities get disenfranchised.  Intent doesn't really matter as much anymore, as SCOTUS recent housing ruling about disparate impact would imply.  

Also, here's [some more information](http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/CGR%20Reprint%20Single%20Page.pdf) - 

&gt; The Supreme Court has interpreted the
federal Constitution to require a particularly compelling reason before a state
can make the race or ethnicity of citizens the “predominant” reason for drawing
particular district lines.129 And the Court has also repeatedly implied that
one such compelling reason is compliance with the federal Voting Rights Act.130

Continuing - 

&gt;Section 2 provides some relief from such tactics. It gives voters the right to
turn to the courts if, for example, a district could be drawn to give a minority
community the opportunity to elect its candidate of choice, but the district
lines instead split the community up into separate districts where its voting
power is diluted. When litigants challenge a redistricting plan or part of a plan
under Section 2, asserting that districts could be drawn to preserve minority
voting power that is otherwise diluted, they must first show that:
	
&gt;1. a minority population is sufficiently geographically compact (that is, living
close together) that it would make sense to draw a district containing it;138

&gt;2.  the minority population (usually, the citizen voting-age minority population)
is large enough to be more than half of a district-sized number of people;139

&gt;3.  the minority population is “politically cohesive” – that is, it would usually
vote as a bloc for the same favored candidate; and

&gt;4.  the majority population would usually vote as a bloc for a different candidate,
so that it would usually be able to defeat the minority-preferred
candidate, if the minority population were fragmented among several
districts.140


&gt;When minority voters and majority voters reliably vote for different candidates,
voting is said to be “racially polarized.” This analysis is sophisticated, looking
at trends over multiple elections at different levels of government. One
election alone – for example, the Presidential election of Barack Obama – will
not generally prove or refute whether elections in a region tend to be racially
polarized.141



&gt;If those attacking the plan can show that all of these conditions are satisfied,
the court will then consider the “totality of circumstances”: the total context
in the area, including the extent of historical discrimination in voting and in
other areas, and the extent to which minorities have been able to elect their
chosen candidates anyway.142 In the past, courts have paid particular attention
to the proportion of districts controlled by minorities, compared to the
minority percentage of the population – investigating, for example, whether
a minority group with 10% of the population controls 10% of the districts
in the area.143 If the court finds that, given the total context, the power of the
minority vote has been diminished, it may demand that a district be drawn
to give the minority population the opportunity to elect a representative of its
choice. Such districts are often known as “minority opportunity districts,” or
“majority-minority districts,” because minorities in such districts will usually
constitute the majority of the voters. These districts do not guarantee that
minority-preferred candidates will be elected, but they are drawn so that if the
minority citizens all vote together, their candidate – who may or may not be a
member of a racial or ethnic minority group – will usually win.144

(Sorry for the wall of text!)

But it feels like every single episode they have to explain what the HoH, veto comp, and all the other garbage is.  I know for a new viewer they might want to know how it all works, but every other show will show this type of thing once or twice and then not give instructions over and over again all year. 

""It's my job as the HoH to select two nominees for eviction..""

*Shot of the HoH looking at the memory wall*

*Shot with the keys being selected and placed in a bag..*

*Shot of the HoH looking outside and calling for HG's*

""It's time for the nomination ceremony..""  

At least for now, there is none of that ole: 

""Dumbass #3, you are safe"" 

""Thanks HoH Gobnobbler!""

The same thing for veto ceremonies.  If those ceremonies were cut out, you'd get an extra 20 minutes of programming per week to spend on worthwhile social game and explanation.  The way it is now, maybe 15 minutes of the show isn't a competition or a ceremony. 

EDIT - And is there a reason every single person has to go to the DR one by one to cast their vote to evict?  Could we not speed up this process a bit?  Couldn't Julie just read the vote?  Or if they want to build suspense, have her read each HG's vote one by one instead to save us a little time?

Price and Cespedes aren't going to get a ton because they'll be rentals.  You'll get some prospects, but everyone seems to think you'll get the next Max Scherzer out of them, you won't.  If the next big thing is in the farm system, they're not giving it up for a rental of an elite pitcher or an above average left fielder.  

Selling Simon leaves yet another hole in SP.  That doesn't just get bandaged with prospects.  

Soria, ok, you want Rondon to close?  Now who's in the 8th?  7th?  Etc?  If Farrell keeps up, sure, but his control does *not* look as good as he'd been doing in the minors.  

Davis - he's too old for you to get anything worthwhile from him.  

Avila - Every decent team is going to say no to Avila and ask for McCann.  Which you could actually get legit talent for.

3107,"In response to your points - 

Michigan fought to end slavery, that's a reason to have a commemoration, not a reason not to.  If it's viewed as ""spiking the football"" 150 years after the fact, then the South can get over itself.

* Your point about how racism still exists is certainly noted.  Yes, it still exists.  But so does MLK day.  I mean, I am with you on the ""look what white people did"" mentality.  But I think that this attitude is a classic political paralysis mentality in the face of overthought.  And remember, this is a resolution, non-binding, so it's not really a holiday.  Typically, declaring a ""day"" for anything from Boy Scout Troops to ""Escanaba Day"" is [ridiculously easy to get through the legislature](https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/3bvil9/a_proposed_michigan_legislative_resolution/csrb9ay).  For some reason, this is different... 

*    What you call bandwagoning and pandering, I would call continuing to build momentum for the movement.  I guess it's a question of how we look at it.  Also, the ""we're in Michigan so slavery is irrelevant"" thing could be applied to Independence day.  Michigan wasn't even a territory owned by the US at the time.  So why celebrate the revolution?  

*  Do both.  Why is an acknowledgement of the past mutually exclusive with doing things for the future?  Taking note of history is pretty important to a lot of people.  

And yes, absolutely Republicans are being douches about it.

Earthquake rescue, Data not only can get into places larger machinery cannot, but can lift and break apart debris to get to people faster. 

Water rescue, I mean, he does not have to breathe!  And in the event of an emergency, he can serve as a flotation device.  

Fireman, the ability to not feel pain allows him to save that puppy that was hiding under the bed as the house burns.  The whole house could collapse around him, and on top of him, and he'd walk away singed but clearly ok.  

Data could save miners in accidents underground much faster than digging an alternate shaft to get to people.  You could just send Data down the first shaft and not be overly concerned about a second collapse.  

Data could also basically walk right in on a barricaded gunman and take a couple bullets while still being operational.  He can always repair himself later as well.

In answer to you and /u/Jensaarai regarding the withholding of information on First Contact, this is different than holding back technology or knowledge of the rest of the galaxy. Instead, it is holding back information about humans themselves, and interactions with humans. That's why I believe that holding back that type of information would be more damaging to relations than holding back technology in the aim of protecting their cultural changes. In fact, if we are making the argument that the Vulcans held back the information of Carbon Creek because FC is ""central to the legitimation of the huge changes taking place in human society,"" then is that deliberate omission interference in an alien culture? Are the Vulcans withholding information to push human culture into what they would like it to be? That's why I would question the motivation behind not revealing the occurrance. If it was as benign as the story would indicate, I don't see the reason for taking a risk in attempting to keep the secret.

Now, the mysterious visit to Carbon Creek from T'Pol, that is a far more difficult question to answer. I'm going to ponder on that for a bit and then possibly edit this later. But I believe that her visit there *is exactly the type of thing* that Vulcans would have been worried about had the story been true. If the story is true, then someone spills the beans, what would be the reaction? And the ease in which such a story would be revealed by such a visit.

Humans know enough about the whereabouts of Vulcans that they knew T'Pol went to Carbon Creek, which is interesting in its own right. But T'Pol was the only Vulcan curious enough to visit the town? That also seems very odd assuming there is knowledge of this contact.

As for what she *actually was* doing in Carbon Creek, yes, that's a toughie that I'm going to have think on it.",2015-06-25 19:35:04+00:00,csil368,3.0,t1_csikz5h,167.0,DaystromInstitute
3250,"Response reposted from the previous CMV post.  

Here goes - **The story of Carbon Creek is only what it is, a story.**

The fascination with humanity is not new to T'Pol or Vulcans. If we go back to ""Fusion,"" T'Pol leaves the compound to find a jazz bar playing a very chaotic experimental jazz music. T'Pol takes risks entering and taking in the music and the odd chaos is something that attracts her. The family history in being fascinated by humans is not necessary to her story.

I submit to you that the acquiring of the purse could have been done on Earth in any antique shop. Because we know that Vulcans can appreciate aesthetics (Spock played music, the IDIC pin is a design choice, numerous artifacts and sculptures in Vulcan sanctuaries), then it is not any stretch that T'Pol would find the aesthetic value of the purse to be attractive, particularly since she had an affinity for humans already.

Those same appreciations for the arts extend into storytelling, something that T'Pol experienced from humans first hand by the telling of ghost stories by Travis Mayweather while camping in ""Strange New World."" Considering the difficulty that T'Pol was having assimilating with the crew, (How many times is she going to get asked to go to movie night??) she decides that the weaving of a tale might be something that fellow crewmembers would appreciate. Since the Ghost of George Webb story seemed to entertain the others on the planet who better to try out her storytelling than on the two people she has the closest relationship with, Archer and Trip?

Seeing the opportunity to practice the craft, she controls the dinner conversation basing her story upon a purchase she had made of an old antiquity. Her ability is seen as she uses the classic ""I can stop telling the story if you like,"" as Archer and Trip are in disbelief of what they are hearing. This only draws them in more.
It is too often that we overlook that Vulcans are incredibly artistic people and that a life of logic does not trump an appreciation for aesthetics. Storytelling traditions are common in many different species. Fictional stories might be viewed as a ""lie"" but T'Pol never indicates that the story is true. That gets her out trap of the Vulcan tendency to never lie when unnecessary.

And there is also the question of the Vulcan database, which is extensive. Those that crashed on Earth would not have the option to forgo reporting that the crash happened, as too many people would know since they were picked up years later by a Vulcan surveyor. If the Vulcans were providing Humans with information via the database, the omission of such an incident could certainly damage relations if it ever was revealed later. Compound this with the fact that there is nothing much for the Vulcans to gain by not telling the Humans that this Carbon Creek incident had happened, and the idea that this story is real becomes even more doubtful.

I would say that the story being fabricated reveals much more about T'Pol's desire to assimilate with humans and her admiration for them. If there is one thing that I think is my favorite part of Jolene Blalock's portrayal of T'Pol, is it her ability to show emotions that come to the surface and T'Pol's fight to suppress them. Blalock does this with her facial expressions quite a bit, and it might seem repetitive to some, but I think that it is a reflection that T'Pol may not have been the most disciplined when it came to her emotions, and the affinity for humans would make sense for someone who is trying to live with the emotions that she cannot seem to bury deep enough.

~~That's my attempt to change your view, hope you enjoyed it.~~ I've always been of the opinion that the story was fabricated, nice to see that the ambiguity in the episode leaves a split opinion with the viewers!",2015-06-25 19:31:40+00:00,csikyam,1.0,t3_3b3hbj,6559.0,DaystromInstitute

Instead, it is holding back information about humans themselves, and interactions with humans.  That's why I believe that holding back that type of information would be more damaging to relations than holding back technology in the aim of protecting their cultural changes.  In fact, if we are making the argument that the Vulcans held back the information of Carbon Creek because FC is ""central to the legitimation of the huge changes taking place in human society,"" then is that deliberate omission interference in an alien culture?  Are the Vulcans withholding information to push human culture into what they would like it to be?  That's why I would question the motivation behind not revealing the occurrance.  If it was as benign as the story would indicate, I don't see the reason for taking a risk in attempting to keep the secret.  

Now, the mysterious visit to Carbon Creek from T'Pol, that is a far more difficult question to answer.  I'm going to ponder on that for a bit and then possibly edit this later.  But I believe that her visit there is *exactly the type of thing* that Vulcans would have been worried about had the story been true.  If the story is true, then someone spills the beans, what would be the reaction?  And the ease in which such a story would be revealed by such a visit.  

Humans know enough about the whereabouts of Vulcans that they knew T'Pol went to Carbon Creek, which is interesting in its own right.  But T'Pol was the only Vulcan curious enough to visit the town?  That also seems very odd assuming there is knowledge of this contact.  

As for what she *actually was* doing in Carbon Creek, yes, that's a toughie that I'm going to have think on it.",2015-06-25 15:52:13+00:00,csic1xd,3.0,t1_csi4t0d,14094.0,DaystromInstitute

3256,"Here goes - **The story of Carbon Creek is only what it is, a story.**

   The fascination with humanity is not new to T'Pol or Vulcans.  If we go back to ""Fusion,"" T'Pol leaves the compound to find a jazz bar playing a very chaotic experimental jazz music.  T'Pol takes risks entering and taking in the music and the odd chaos is something that attracts her.  The family history in being fascinated by humans is not necessary to her story.  

  I submit to you that the acquiring of the purse could have been done on Earth in any antique shop.  Because we know that Vulcans can appreciate aesthetics (Spock played music, the IDIC pin is a design choice, numerous artifacts and sculptures in Vulcan sanctuaries), then it is not any stretch that T'Pol would find the aesthetic value of the purse to be attractive, particularly since she had an affinity for humans already.  

  Those same appreciations for the arts extend into storytelling, something that T'Pol experienced from humans first hand by the telling of ghost stories by Travis Mayweather while camping in ""Strange New World.""  Considering the difficulty that T'Pol was having assimilating with the crew, (How many times is she going to get asked to go to movie night??) she decides that the weaving of a tale might be something that fellow crewmembers would appreciate.  Since the Ghost of George Webb story seemed to entertain the others on the planet who better to try out her storytelling than on the two people she has the closest relationship with, Archer and Trip?  

Seeing the opportunity to practice the craft, she controls the dinner conversation basing her story upon a purchase she had made of an old antiquity.  Her ability is seen as she uses the classic ""I can stop telling the story if you like,"" as Archer and Trip are in disbelief of what they are hearing.  This only draws them in more.  

It is too often that we overlook that Vulcans are incredibly artistic people and that a life of logic does not trump an appreciation for aesthetics.  Storytelling traditions are common in many different species.  Fictional stories might be viewed as a ""lie"" but T'Pol never indicates that the story is true.  That gets her out trap of the Vulcan tendency to never lie when unnecessary.  

And there is also the question of the Vulcan database, which is extensive.  Those that crashed on Earth would not have the option to forgo reporting that the crash happened, as too many people would know since they were picked up years later by a Vulcan surveyor.  If the Vulcans were providing Humans with information via the database, the omission of such an incident could certainly damage relations if it ever was revealed later.  Compound this with the fact that there is nothing much for the Vulcans to gain by *not* telling the Humans that this Carbon Creek incident had happened, and the idea that this story is real becomes even more doubtful.  

I would say that the story being fabricated reveals much more about T'Pol's desire to assimilate with humans and her admiration for them.  If there is one thing that I think is my favorite part of Jolene Blalock's portrayal of T'Pol, is it her ability to show emotions that come to the surface and T'Pol's fight to suppress them.  Blalock does this with her facial expressions quite a bit, and it might seem repetitive to some, but I think that it is a reflection that T'Pol may not have been the most disciplined when it came to her emotions, and the affinity for humans would make sense for someone who is trying to live with the emotions that she cannot seem to bury deep enough.  

That's my attempt to change your view, hope you enjoyed it.  I've always been of the opinion that the story was fabricated, nice to see that the ambiguity in the episode leaves a split opinion with the viewers!",2015-06-25 00:01:08+00:00,cshojh1,1.0,t3_3azs8p,12136.0,DaystromInstitute
3257,"That cartoon is excellent.  One gripe, the idea that international treaties override national law.  That is only based on the desire to keep international law viable.  There is no reason that a nation wouldn't just break a treaty if they wanted to.  

The US for example, is a signatory to a treaty about drug laws, to keep cannabis (among other things) illegal.  Nations are watching closely to see if the US popular opinion shift and state legalization will break that treaty in the future.  

A world where treaties are easily broken shows how delicate international law can be.  It's something no nation really wants because it can cause instability.  But at the same time, there's very little legal issues that say international treaties override judiciaries in court because enforcement of treaties is based more on trust than anything.",2015-06-24 21:53:57+00:00,cshk5iv,2.0,t1_csh9neu,15707.0,explainlikeimfive

The state wants to have influence over universities, but their influence is very limited because they don't fund the schools anymore.  In the 1980's, the state funded 80% of university budgets.  Today, its more like 20%.  That's why the $1m in ""bonus performance money"" that the state offers is essentially worthless to EMU.

Why bother even acknowledging any of the research in the education field on this very subject?  Service learning?  Let's do it online!  Huh?  

Synchronous distance education is outperformed by a classroom model in research.  Not to mention that the very idea of everyone skyping in at the same time *defeats the purpose of online education* in most scenarios.  (Why have everyone show up at the same time using technology when they could just show up in a class at the same time?)  Distance education only is effective *with* instructors who are available to interact with students.  Your planned obsolescence of teachers is way too early. 

Grading papers is not something coming soon.  Watson may be able to answer a question, but he's a far cry from being able to evaluate an argument.  Prove me wrong.

Skype still has detachment.  It's not the same thing.  

Lesson plans are often tailored to the group of students as well.  I talk to my students before class even starts to make material relevant to their goals.  Grading papers is something that cannot be automated at this time, and it won't be a long time before that will happen.
