Some of this stems from a previous experience with a dentist misdiagnosing a child who is close to my family saying he needed 3 fillings.  A second opinion revealed he had no cavities.  This affected me greatly with skepticism.  Ironically, this child is now a college student getting ready to start dental school in a couple years.  However I don't really have time to wait for him to graduate though!

My last visit I explained that my fear has kept me out of a dentist chair for over ten years and that I need to know what is happening and why, and that I do not take pain well *at all.*  Unfortunately they did not take my fear very seriously.  The dentist reviewed X-Rays and examined my mouth rattling off to the hygienist all of the work needed on each tooth, just the number and procedure (one even said 'extraction' which made me even more scared).  He never addressed me other than to say hello and never showed me a single X-ray picture.  Before the hygienist was finished measuring the distance between gum and tooth with that metal tool (sorry I don't know the names of these things) I walked out of the office in tears because of the emotional discomfort and pain.  

I have a real need for work done and I know this, I had another chip fall out of a bottom front tooth today.  I would imagine this is the one that needs extraction, but the other dentist never said anything about that to me, he was in and out very quickly.  I would love to hear any help to deal with this fear.  I looked into sedation dentistry, the nearest place that even offers it is an hour and a half away.  I'm willing to pay the cost for some type of sedation (up to around $500 I'm hoping).  I do have dental insurance for cleanings and other work.  

What kind of sedation would be offered at that price?  I've never been knocked out before, but in this case, I would be willing.  I don't know if a dentist would even offer sedation at a first visit, however.  

Other than sedation, are there any other tips or tricks for dealing with this?  I hate putting this off and I'd like to get as much done as possible as quickly as possible.  Even the thought of sitting back in the chair makes my hands shake and heart race.  There *is* a dental school and med school in my city, but I'm not sure if they offer sedation, is that common in those types of places?  

I appreciate any help, and encouragement, that you can offer.  ",Dentistry,Dental phobia tips?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/59gehd/dental_phobia_tips/

&gt;I do however respect the fact that she was able to produce this entertaining video for us here on /r/publicfreakout

Can't even get credit for making a video of an actual freakout because she had to have done something wrong.  Even though we only have the angry man to listen to regarding that. 

Frankly, this is another good reason to Taxi &gt; Uber as well.  Uber said the ride was over, she wasn't at the ER, and Gramps McGee goes ballistic on a patient.

&gt;Nothing wrong with social justice.
There is a reason its called ""social justice warrior"", its when you take it to ridiculous authoritarian extremes.

Ah, yes, it's not social justice, it's the SJW that is the problem!  Hurry, we need to make a distinction!  This way, we can ensure that anyone who actually does something fro social justice we can just label an SJW, while not doing anything can be praised. 

&gt;Social justice can, just not being an SJW.
The idea of equality is good, being an asshole and doxing and sending threats is not.

Yes, Gamergate *is the real* social justice!  We need to fight for gamers first.  Then we can worry about the women and the minorities.

&gt;What an ambiguous statement from our friend Edward.

""Does not compute.""

&gt;while I don't think he means SJW's, let's think about this... this could be a good thing. the US government despises this guy... so when he says something like this, they'll probably go after people spouting off about social justice.... and who does that daily? :)

Ah, the ole Reddit switch-a-roo.  The government will go after the SJW's now instead of GamerGaters!  Except #BLM protestors are already spied on by the government, and #GamerGaters aren't a blip on the radar...  

&gt;Social justice is bigotry and tyranny disguised as a concern for humanity.It is thinly-veiled narcissism and arrogance with a rotten and dead center.

&gt;By it's very nature it is,and will always be supremacist.SJW's are an inevitable end result of that kind of thinking.Not an aberration of it.

&gt;This is just the new religion to replace the old ones that are dying.What is truly worrisome is that there are so many,especially atheists, who actually can't see that this is the exact same thing as Christianity,Islam,Feminism,Stalinism,Nazism,etc. Just given a slightly new wrapper.Or rather a reused wrapper because this social justice tune has been sung before.

Pretty obvious that there is some Islamophobia going on here, especially since quotes at the meeting included ""This is a Christian community, let them build their mosque in a Muslim community.""
So I'm sure the good folks at /r/Michigan[2] will call these people out and call out the Planning Commission of Sterling Heights. Let's take a look, eh? 

Top Comment -
&gt;If the deciding factor was it's too tall (that's how it came across to me, please correct if I'm wrong) then just build the thing to code and go again.
&gt;&gt;That's what I read, too. This isn't anti-religion oppression, this is a city planner doing his job.

So we're thinking that city planning doesn't provide any regulations or instructions to people before they spend bunches of money on architectural designs. They've never even seen a mosque before so they wouldn't know that they typically are tall, like, I dunno, churches? Of course the city planners had no other motivation, just the letter of the law, right? Right??

&gt;The larger concern I can see is the mosque blasting out the Adhan in the middle of a residential zone in the wee hours of the morning. Dunno if you've ever been around it, but its far more disturbing to a normal routine than bells.

What? So churchbells are fine but something that sounds foreign is scary. Pretty sure most Mosques don't blast their calls to prayer over the neighborhood in the US.

&gt;Copied and pasted the following regarding it... Comments being voiced her are ridiculous, and many from people outside of the city. The area is zoned residential. Traffic and road conditions in the area do not permit a large public structure being built in this location. You can call it racism or religious freedom or anything else you want, that doesn't change the fact that the area can't physically support a development of this scale. The mosque is outgrowing its current home and will continue to grow, the city made the correct decision based on fact. The statement by the mayor is genuine and well written.

I'm pretty positive that most churches and synagogues are placed in zoned residential areas. They aren't in zoned commercial areas very often because I don't usually see the lineup of strip mall, burger king, Best Buy, St Dominican, The Gap on most of the streets of Suburbia USA. But you know, suddenly every redditor has become an expert on zoning and city planning today.

&gt;And to add from another article[1] : The property is zoned single-family residential. The proposed building is 20,500-square-foot on 4Â­.5 acres. The towers still would be 27 feet taller than the maximum allowed by the city. The 65-foot dome would far exceed the height of other structures nearby. It'll be 6 stories tall versus the 1-2 stories surrounding it. But yeah, I'm sure all of the residents that are opposed to this are just Islamophobic and possibly racist.

""I'm just going to put out a bunch of numbers with no context and make them sound impressive here."" Pretty sure what makes the community Islamophobic are the choice quotes from the people who were at these meetings. But let's forget about them.
And an appearance of the poorly informed Atheist circlejerk shows up just in time to underscore the stupidity -

&gt;I dont want the mosque built either. Not because its muslim or anything, but because Im sick of fucking religious structures being built every place instead of community centers, or money being given to public libraries and places for everyone in the city to go, not just one demographic.

Commenter just below does manage to put him in his place though -

And I really enjoyed your threads outside of gamedays and liked contributing while learning all about this Loria character.  I'll be pulling for the Fish as my NL team for a while now.  Actually, I'll be pulling for your team to get a new owner and whole new front office.  Cuz it's the hardcore fans that love the team when they're in the dumps that make your sub and your fanbase great.  

When you *do* get good, don't pull a KC Royals and let everyone jump in the pool.  Get some good gatekeepers so the riff raff have to pay their propers.  

Enjoy the rest of the season!  Go #1 Draft Pick!",letsgofish,"We laughed together, cried together, ok, just bitched mainly. Was good to be a Marlin.",http://www.reddit.com/r/letsgofish/comments/3gbb4f/we_laughed_together_cried_together_ok_just/

Zach Lee - 23 year old right hander who has vaulted through the system.  [This is the Dodgers 7th ranked prospect and is MLB ready with lots of upside](http://www.truebluela.com/2015/1/24/7666191/zach-lee-dodgers-prospects-2015).  This season he has really bounced back sporting a 7-3 record, sub-2.50 ERA, and a 1.08 WHIP for the ground ball pitcher.  

Corey Seager is not likely to be on any deal, he was the #1 prospect in Baseball America for the midseason, and he's a SS.  But at 21 he is young enough to learn a new position if need be (Maybe an OF to replace Cespedes?)  

Julio Urias would be the type of guy to gamble on.  He's only 18.  ONLY 18!  But ranked as one of the top 10 prospects in the nation as a starting pitcher.  A lefty with composure beyond his years. Playing in AA Tulsa he has a 3.00 ERA in 7 starts.  [SOURCE](http://www.truebluela.com/2015/7/8/8910257/corey-seager-julio-urias-jose-deleon-dodgers-top-prospects)  

Pablo Fernandez is a high priced prospect from Cuba.  RHP who has [had some shoulder stiffness](http://www.truebluela.com/2015/7/8/8910257/corey-seager-julio-urias-jose-deleon-dodgers-top-prospects) lately but is coming back right now. 

Jose De Leon, another RHP.  Puerto Rican currently playing for AA Tulsa.  Age 22.  Not having the best season but someone so young you never know.  [More info here.](http://www.minorleagueball.com/2015/5/7/8558521/scouting-the-california-league-jose-deleon-scouting-report-dodgers)
