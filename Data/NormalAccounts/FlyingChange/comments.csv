Perhaps it would be easier to explain that the United States does not allow it's government to restrict gun ownership. It isn't that the government allows it- it's that the people prevent the government from prohibiting it. That's the fundamental difference, I think, between US gun ownership and non-US gun ownership.

17,"Quite a few states and cities offer a lot of services for homeless people and mentally ill people. The problem is that the city and state cannot force treatment on them.

As a very leftwing friend of mine in college once said, ""I have no sympathy for homeless people here in Portland- with the amount of food banks and shelters we have here, you have to *try* to be hungry.""

While that is a bit of an exaggeration, she has a point- there is a large infrastructure set up to help people. Part of the problem, I think, is the rampant drug usage and zero tolerance policies on drug use. People would rather continuing using crack, heroin, or meth than  get better and become a normal part of society... or in the case of the Hobo-Island people, they were just happier living outside and didn't want to be a part of normal society- they were even offered government assistance when the city cleared them off the island.

And then you run into issues like drug dealers moving into government assistance housing... that's really fucked up.

I once spent a few hours talking to a guy in a pizza place late at night in SE Portland. He was a meth addict. He told me that he lived in SRO housing, and that there were a lot of meth dealers who lived in the building. He really wanted to get clean, but he couldn't because people kept pushing drugs on him.

61,"&gt; guns are not suppose to be cool, to let people pretend they are soldiers when hunting

People don't hunt with ARs because they are cool... ARs are light weight, plastic doesn't warp nearly as much as wood (problem when you hunt in wet climates), they're accurate, easy to maintain, and quick to shoulder and fire- all excellent characteristics in a hunting rifle. Hell, I'd venture to say that the AR-10 (.308 caliber model) is the finest all around hunting rifle in the world.

&gt; that would mean that sniper rifles would be #1 choice

&gt; Sniper rifle

Nothing distinguishes a sniper's rifle from a hunting rifle. Literally nothing. A long barreled, bolt action hunting rifle is not ideal for home defense, because a large caliber, high velocity round is not ideal at close range. Honestly, within 25 yards, the mechanical accuracy of any given firearm is *functionally* (not 100%) identical. That is, there isn't a need for match grade, long distance mechanical accuracy. What is important is the shooter's accuracy *with the weapon*. ARs are easy to shoulder, sight, and shoot with accuracy. They are not heavy, they are maneuverable, and they are simple to operate. In other words, they make for a good home defense gun.

&gt; but imagine your gun is as long as you are tall,

Nobody was talking about having a 6 foot tall rifle. Most AR-15s have a 16 inch barrel, which is really quite short.

85,"I feel like your focus should be on your son, and making sure that he understands what is going on. You definitely should not prohibit your son from seeing his friend... he won't understand the difference between trying to keep him safe and punishing him for something he can't control.

Allow him to still be friends with the boy at school, and tell him that he may invite his friend over to play. Just put the limit on going to his house without your supervision because ""[friend's name here] mom doesn't understand how to help keep you safe."" Or something like that.

Invite your son's friend and his friend's mother over. Talk to her in private about the allergies, and have her sit down and look at some of the medical paperwork from your son's doctors explaining the severity of his allergies. Give her some easy to understand resources on it, but don't be patronizing about it- try to treat her with the respect she clearly doesn't deserve, but try to be reasonable with her.

&gt; She basically told me that she thought I was making up Simon's allergies to make him seem ""special,"" and anyway, ""It's not like he'll die from them."" 

Tell her that you do not want your son to be special in that way, and that it's really unfair and insensitive to talk to you and your son that way. Be firm, and tell her that until she has a better understanding of allergies, your son is not to stay over at her home. Tell her that your son's safety is your primary concern.

If she is unreasonable after that, then you need to sit down with your son and tell him that his friend's mom doesn't understand his allergies, and she won't keep him from getting sick... Say, ""it's like if she made you ride in the car without a seatbelt and then started speeding and slamming on the breaks."" Her behavior is not safe, and so you have to protect him even more.

Make sure that when he is around his friend, he ONLY eats food that he KNOWS that you made.  Maybe consider giving him a basic cell phone for when he goes places- it doesn't even need a sim card (all cell phones must be able to dial 911, even without a sim card). When he goes places, give him a note card that says, ""I'm in allergic shock, I'm at [this address], I need help now, nobody is helping me.""

87,"My current boss worked at a harness/standardbred barn for a while, and said basically the same thing. Some of her horse handling habits came from what she learned there, but everything is very similar to your run of the mill sport horse.

But yeah, American thoroughbred racing is definitely a whole different beast. It takes a certain amount of tact to safely deal with an OTTB.

My last boss had an off the track TB stallion. He was a cool horse, but it definitely took him a little while to adapt. When we first brought him to the barn, the only way one person could tack him up was to tack him up in his stall. Once, while my boss was busy, she had me lunge him (which we had taught him to do) and then tack him up. It took me a few minutes extra to tack him up because after lunging him, I walked him back to his stall to put the saddle on.

When I brought the horse to the arena, the trainer started to yell at me for wasting her time and taking too long. I explained to her that I had to take him back to his stall, and she asked why I hadn't just tacked him up in the round pen (we did that with a number of different horses), and said that off the track TBs are frequently tacked up in structures similar to round pens.

I then brought up the fact that typically, race thoroughbreds are tacked up by two to three grooms who keep the horse walking while they tack up. She stopped, thought for a moment, and said, ""Oh, I guess that's right. Well, since you were on your own, I guess what you did makes sense.""

And that's the thing- even little stuff like that is so different for these horses, and experienced trainers, like my former boss, can space out and forget about just how different they are. It takes a lot of extra attention to work with them and really bring them into the fold of horse-y civilization.",2016-07-03 00:01:00+00:00,d4x4u8v,,t1_d4wklt5,36657.0,Equestrian

Four year old thoroughbreds are already a handful, even for seasoned grooms and trainers. That's why you'll almost never see a TB being led at the track without a lip chain or a bit.

Race trained horses are NOT started like normal horses. Many do not know how to lunge, and they know next to nothing about ground work.

That's because they did not teach him to crosstie. TBs on the track are never crosstied. Even the ones trained in ""normal"" barns are tacked up with a groom or a trainer holding the horse immediately before the rider gets on and starts working. 

&gt;  and you can't hose him down.

Probably because you're putting him in a washrack type situation he's unfamiliar with.

How did he get loose? Did he get loose by opening a stall, by breaking through a stall, breaking through crossties, or by getting away from you?

If you could afford a destrier, you could afford a squire or dedicated handler to pony your destrier for you. Doing it all on your own would be a stupid risk with a large investment, like your expensive warhorse. 

Now, this is more of a generalization than a hard rule.

126,"Horses and riders were fairly well armored, even in earlier times. Xenophon wrote that the horse should be armored on his chest and face, as well as his thighs and belly. He said that the rider should have a helm, a breastplate, a backplate, and as much armor on the left arm as possible. 

Beyond that, the Cataphracts, a type of early heavy cavalry, had full mail sets for both the horse and rider. There is a fair amount of documentation a d evidence for early horse heavy armor.

The rule of thumb is that a horse can safely carry 20% of its body weight safely. An ""average"" early modern horse was probably around 1000lbs. So, they could safely carry 200lbs of rider and armor without too many issues for an extended period of time. For shorter periods of time, a 1000lbs horse, when properly conditioned, could carry about 300lbs, if the weight was distributed fairly evenly. 

Most weight limitations come from the weight of the rider pressing down on the horse's spine. The spine did not evolve to bear weight, and the back of a horse is sensitive. Xenophon even wrote about the importance of protecting the horse's back. Proper training was (and is) training that develops the back. 

So, you can armor other parts of the horse without adding too much to your maximum weight limit. A cataphract's barding, if fitted well, would not encumber a horse too much. So, the main weight restriction would be on the rider. 

An early (pre-saddle) rider would have most likely supported themselves more by gripping with their legs and thighs than by sitting, which would also help with weight distribution. 

Some Asiatic people developed the saddle, and subsequently the saddle tree. The saddle and tree allowed for even better weight distribution along the horse's back, and allowed the rider to better balance himself, which allowed for more armored riders and more armored horses.

130,"Well, the effective range and the maximum range are two different questions, as are, ""effective range while moving at speed"" and ""effective range while stopped,"" and ""Effective range while dismounted."" Beyond that, the horse archer was *effective beyond the range of his bow and arrow.* That is the question I will attempt to answer

There are not many definitive answers to the maximum or even effective range of a Mongolian horse archer. Part of this, I believe, is due to how the Mongolians thought about horse archer tactics.

The concept of ""effective range"" as a definite number is more of a standard military idea than a Mongolian military idea. Range matters most when your ranged units are stationary and have to remain stationary to shoot. To the English longbowman, range matters a fair amount- before he can shoot, he has to get to a place where he can shoot, draw a very large bow, aim, and release, either with a lot of other archers while firing in volleys, or while shooting at specific targets. Typically, he is not fighting on his own, as he would be behind a line of spears or behind fortifications. The bulk of the conflict would be hand-to-hand at close range, where armored men with spears, axes, swords, and clubs would brawl.

So, his effective range is the farthest away he can be while still being useful while the armored guys fight it out. A good definition of effective range for us, then, is, ""The range at which a particular unit is useful.""

But Mongolians did not fight that way. The bulk of the Mongolian military consisted of mounted horse archers, supported by some mounted lancers. Sometimes, they would use Chinese-developed siege weapons. So, when asking about the effective range of a horse archer, we need to think about the range of the entire horse/bow system, because that determines the range we are trying to determine.

The horse archer was the ""front line"" warrior in the Mongolian military. Mongolians won battles mostly through superior maneuverability and by picking the ""correct"" battles to fight. Many times, they would push forward, feign an attack, retreat, and then double back, circle the enemy, and flank them. Typically when making these types of movements, the horse archers would be a few hundred feet away when they released arrows. Sometimes they were aimed, and sometimes they were in volleys. All of the horse archers were excellent shots who could pick targets, but sometimes tactical situations would call for unaimed shots. 

For example, if the warriors were trying to lead a target into an ambush, they might ride forward, shoot into a line of infantry, turn, and ride away, knowing that skirmishers or cavalry would pursue. The arrows and bows were not effective against focused infantry lines, especially lines of infantry armed with spears. Instead of trying to whittle away defended positions, the Mongolians would find ways to scatter formations and cause confusion among the enemy ranks. So, after the skirmishers or light cavalry started to follow the Mongols in pursuit, the Mongols would ambush, destroy the pursuers, return to the formation they were attacking, and then do the same thing. While the formation of infantry or whatever else attempted to deal with one group of warriors, another group would make a wide flanking movement and start attacking from behind- they would attack with bows, but it was entirely possible that they might then close distance and attack with lances and swords before falling back and attacking with bows again.

And this could be happening across miles of pasture and space. A horse archer could move between 50-70 miles in a day.

So, for a strategic range, I would say, probably 50 miles. For a tactical range, I'd estimate about 1000 meters. Note- that is not the firing range, which was likely 300 meters, depending on the quality of the bow and the archer.",2016-05-17 21:57:16+00:00,d39e076,1.0,t3_4jod76,75448.0,AskHistorians
131,"While researching something else, I found this little clip showing German troopers riding down a street. Most are riding at about a trot, and most are rising to the trot (alternating between a standing and sitting position with each stride of the trot). Many of the riders are riding on a reasonably long rein, and some of the enlisted men are excellent riders. Others are lacking in riding ability- as Francis Dwyer noted in his manual on cavalry saddles, many cavalrymen are awful riders.

Riders would keep their post rhythm synchronized to one of the horse's legs for 10-15 minutes, after which they would switch to the other leg. The belief was that this would keep the horse from becoming sore. 

The men are carrying the [M1893 lance](http://i.imgur.com/KqW6VZN.jpg), which were issued to the cavalry, even during WWI. For more pictures, look [here](http://angloboerwarmuseum.com/Boer20c_techofwar_lance.html).

142,"Yes. Many people aimed for the horses instead of the riders. 

Roman writer Vegetius wrote this in his text on Roman warfare:

&gt; The armed chariots used in war by Antiochus and Mithridates at first terrified the Romans, but they afterwards made a jest of them. As a chariot of this sort does not always meet with plain and level ground, the least obstruction stops it. And if one of the horses be either killed or wounded, it falls into the enemy's hands. The Roman soldiers rendered them useless chiefly by the following contrivance: at the instant the engagement began, they strewed the field of battle with caltrops, and the horses that drew the chariots, running full speed on them, were infallibly destroyed. A caltrop is a device composed of four spikes or points arranged so that in whatever manner it is thrown on the ground, it rests on three and presents the fourth upright

Basically, the Romans would little the field with small spikes that would break the hooves of the horses. The horses would fall down when they stepped on them, the charioteers would fall out, and the Romans would kill them and take their chariots.

[Here](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_C6_DXX4pkmQ/S_tM2lJT-9I/AAAAAAAAAYE/E5P0HSjYCH0/s1600/P1010063.JPG) we see a spike horse bit (the thing that goes in their mouth). These bits were fairly common, and they existed primarily to keep the enemy from grabbing the horse by the bit and pulling it down or out, thereby removing the rider's ability to control the horse. Here is a picture of just the [bit](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9d/3a/64/9d3a6450d2946cb5073543344dbbf139.jpg).

Spear equipped infantry would almost always aim for the horse- it just makes more sense to do so. This is why horse armor existed- if it wasn't common or likely, people would not have spent marge sums of money to armor a horse.

Even in Xenophon's text, *On Horsemanship* (the first book on riding that we have, from about 400BC), talks about way to protect the horse from enemy attacks.

Anyway. Your question was more directly focused on the Middle Ages... yes. Medieval armies still used and carried caltrops. They also used spears, and would use spears against horses at pretty much any given opportunity.

Sometimes, like in the battle of Chaumont in 1098, apparently William II lost some 700 horses to archers who were told specifically to shoot for the horses.

So, yes, in Medieval combat, losing your horse to warfare was very common.

Now, sometimes it did make sense to only kill the rider to seize the horse, but taking horses as prizes usually was only a concern after the battle. During a battle, where your life was at risk, your priority would be to kill your attack and not to take a prize.",2016-05-13 20:14:16+00:00,d34h988,1.0,t3_4j2wyb,82772.0,AskHistorians
143,"So, when a European army stopped for the night, they were *very* stopped. When a Mongolian army stopped, they were somewhat less stopped. The difference here is that Europeans would make camp and the Mongolians would find it.

So, this necessity of stopping and camping made warfare a more economically taxing thing for the Europeans. In short, each individual of a European force was somewhat less self sufficient than his Mongolian counterpart.

Does this mean that European armies are worse than Mongolian ones? Absolutely not! A European army is a very effective thing when fighting a European war. A Mongolian army is a very effective thing when fighting a Mongolian style war.

But you just can't compare those two things. Really, it would be better to ask, ""Why was a European army more expensive than a Mongolian army of a similar time period?""

144,"What is a horse? A horse is a horse, of course of course! 

Unless we're talking about types of horses.

Horses exist in many variations and with varying needs and levels of care. Think cars- Some cars are expensive. Cars in some regions are more expensive to own and drive. Cars in other regions are cheaper and easier to maintain. Your question kinda presumes equality across all horses, which is a problematic place to start. It's like asking, ""Because a main battle tank is expensive, how do low-tech warlords field large numbers of trucks with mounted machine guns?""

Basically, it is comparing two things that shouldn't really be compared. But, I'll try to explain the differences:

**Space**

The first and biggest difference in cost is *grazing space.*

A nomadic army of Mongolians is something of a nebulous entity. While moving and on campaign, individuals and groups of warriors would spread apart, find supplies, and remain fairly independent until they would focus together for an attack. A single horse requires a large amount of grazing space to eat and maintain energy. Lots of horses require lots of space. The steppes have HUGE amounts of space. The Mongolian empire consisted largely of places that had lots and lots of space for their horses. The empire typically didn't stretch that far into areas that didn't have the grazing space for large numbers of horses. There are exceptions to this, but really, they did not move far into places without grazing space, or places where their style of horse-mounted combat on large, open spaces was not advantageous.

Europe is a lot more compact than a steppe. It is hard to maintain *huge* numbers of horses in forested, mountainous with lots of geographical barriers. Imagine trying to move thousands of horses through wood-pasture, or trying to set up a hit-and-run attack in a place where you could easily get trapped or flanked.

So, when you have your European armies with horses, you have to bring food for them because you might not find adequate pasture space, or you might be constrained in such a way that prevents you from leaving camp by a few thousand yards to find pasture for your horses while you camp for the night- if the army spreads a thousand yards across hills and forests and rivers, good luck reassembling that in any short period of time.

**Horse type**

Nomadic tribes, like Mongols, fielded large numbers of low maintenance and hardy ponies. Mongolian ponies are very roughly domesticated and have been bred for endurance and hardiness. They live very much like their (now exceedingly rare) wild counterparts. Really, a [Mongolian horse](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Mongolian-horse.jpg) and a [wild horse](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Przewalskis_horse_02.jpg) have a lot in common, in terms of build. The neck, face, legs, body type, and size are *very* similar. They are not identical in confirmation, but they are close.

Western horses in Europe, the Mediterranean, and the MENA region have undergone significant changes over the last 5 thousand years. Many of these changes happened through focused human breeding programs. These breeding programs were designed to create faster, bigger, stronger, and more trainable horses. Breeding programs and breeding lines are generational projects, and things like stud-books and breeding guides were handed down through many generations of horse breeders.

Because of that kind of breeding program, horses started developing more specialized needs. Bigger horses require better food. Some start to need things like grain and oats. Because of changes in the horse's feet through breeding, some will need shoes. Their bodies start to become more sensitive to the elements, because their coats become more refined and less coarse.

And when these horses are trained, kept indoors, and become accustomed to human care, they lose many of their natural survival instincts. Taking a Prussian warhorse and leaving him on the steppes would be kind of like taking a Rottweiler and expecting him to thrive like a wolf (in some cases, dogs do adapt well enough to being feral, and horses did that as well- see the American Mustang. But, North American was something of an exemption due to exceptionally horse-friendly environment).

Mongolian horses survive very well off the land, and they are adapted for a hard, nomadic life. Western horses adapted for a life that did not require surviving in difficult conditions. This does not mean that Mongolian horses are ""better."" Western horses are capable of feats of athleticism and training that are far beyond the scope of anything one could expect of a Mongolian horse. An American thoroughbred moves faster than anything a Genghis Khan would have thought possible. But, to him, even Secretariat would be fairly useless because of the amount of specialized care a horse like that needs to maintain that kind of peak performance without breaking down.

Now, beyond that, MENA, Europe, and the Mediterranean are not always the most horse-friendly areas. Finding forage for that many specialized horses was extremely difficult, and many things relating to care had to be brought with the horse (if you spend a huge sum of money on a war horse, are you going to risk letting it starve?).

**Horse training**

Mongolian horses are, and were, very roughly trained. A Mongolian is interested in the horse as a very rough vehicle. When fighting, a Mongolian is most interested in riding without using his hands and shooting from a somewhat stable, raised position. The horse manages the speed, angle of travel, and deals with his own balance. The warrior might change directions (e.g. towards the enemy, away from the enemy), but otherwise, the horse was only roughly steered. This was a kind of horse riding well adapted to large, open spaces where precisely putting a horse in one spot did not *really* matter as much as covering distance quickly and effectively.

Europeans were MUCH more precise in their riding. This was because many Europeans cavalrymen used lances and swords. To get to the enemy, you had to ride into him. Additionally, you had to be able to maneuver your horse through a more compact environment.

Now, training a horse to run directly at the mass of point enemy sticks, banners, flags, loud noises, and general scariness took a lot of time and money. Training the European horse was a specialized activity, and it cost money. The war horse was an expensive tool because a huge amount of effort went into making one. Losing a good horse was extremely costly- you could not replace your trained warhorse with your average riding horse and expect similar results. And what results are those? A terrible, awful, powerful charge, with a thousand pounds of horse and rider crashing home at something at 20 miles an hour before scurrying away, turning back, and then hitting again and again, causing a massive hole in the enemy lines that you could exploit by rushing with infantry, or hitting with yet another line of heavy horse, causing the enemy to rout and run! Or something to that effect...

**Method of warfare**

Now, another part of the expense of western horses comes with the differences in how Westerners do warfare.

This is extremely generalized. A knight would have at least two horses with him at any given time, but likely more. He would have his ""riding horse"" and his ""charging horse."" The riding horse would be better suited for moving around on campaign. The charging horse would be better suited for battle. The battle horse would require somebody to handle him, and that person would probably be leading him from their own horse. Next, these horses require food, which requires some kind of draught animal, potentially a draught horse, pulling a wagon with supplies. All of these horses require food, grain, and other supplies to keep going. Additionally, the knight and all of his buddies required food, water, bedding, probably a change of clothing, additional lances, parts to repair armor, and other logistical items. Every knight increases the number of horses by at least three (but for a well off knight, at least 5 [In theory, a knight could have a procession of well over a dozen horses, belonging to him, his squires, his retainers, and his ancillaries]). This took a lot of space, and a lot of food, and as we established, the Europeans did not have the amount of pasture space available that Mongolians had.

A Mongolian warrior travelled with a string of horses as well, but his horses would be more generalized. They were more interchangeable between roles, and losing one, while definitely unfortunate, would not be quite as bad as a knight losing his extremely expensive warhorse. The Mongolians were responsible for their own horses, and they typically had fewer people assisting them with the logistical side of war. 

Mongol armies also had little to no infantry, which typically require a more dedicated supply train of draught animals for food and supply. Because the average European soldier was not mounted on a horse, he could not carry quite as much in the way of food, and he could not explore as far as a Mongolian warrior to find food.

Again, we don't *really* know this, because the cultures that had horses first also didn't really keep a lot of records.

But at any rate, we know reasonably well that chariots started appearing somewhere around 2000 B.C.E. Chariots were used primarily for human transportation. This differs from standard ""work"" in that the horse/chariot system at the time was really not appropriate for heavy work, like hauling or plowing. Due to limitations in technology, like the lack of an anatomically friendly horse collar (load bearing part of the harness that the horse pulls against to move the cart), there was something of a weight limit to the chariot. Basically, with many types of harnessing, if the horse pulled too hard against it, it would restrict the horse's airway, suffocating it as it worked. So, a smaller chariot might be able to pull 1-2 men effectively without suffocating the horse with the harnessing. Due to differences in anatomy, draught animals like oxen were able to pull loads better than horses at the time. Horses, however, had the advantage of speed, which oxen are not famed for, and a single horse is often considered stronger than a single ox. Horses are also somewhat more temperamental than oxen, making the ox a more economical choice.

During the time of the chariot, horse riding didn't really exist (people probably tried and failed a LOT), and so ""cavalry"" didn't exist. Horse riding took another few hundred years (for breeding/training to develop in the correct ways), and started becoming more common throughout the Eurasian steppes, where it spread in all directions.

So, we start seeing things like light cavalry and horse riding existing around 1000BC-700BC. But as effective cavalry? Well... that depends on what you think effective cavalry actually is. Greek cavalry functioned mostly as skirmishers, but they were not the bulk of an army, and they were definitely not used for heavy fighting. Roman cavalry functioned in a similar way.

And yes, people probably used some horses as pack animals, but horses in all areas were far too expensive to keep for mundane uses like packing supplies- horses require lots of care, grass, and had needs beyond that of an ox. Again, the horse is stronger, but the ox is more economical.

Really, I'd say that cavalry was not truly effective militarily until the advent of the stirrup and coupled with the lance- only then could cavalry really compete with the military efficacy of heavy infantry, which was probably somewhere around 800 A.D. (In Europe, at least. Bite my shiny-metal-European focus, at least until I can do some more specific research on the time frames of Chinese horsemanship....)

And it wasn't until the invention of riding and the stirrup that horses were bred large enough to actually ""work"" in a useful context, and even then, the anatomically correct horse collar didn't spread to Europe until somewhere between 900-1200AD, well after the stirrup became more widespread.

Horse became useful for work when horses were bred large enough for draught, and then it still took a while for people to decide that horses were faster at ploughing than oxen. Even then, many people remained in favor of ox teams, because ox teams were cheaper and easier to maintain than horse teams.

**So, I'd say people realized the agricultural potential of the horse somewhere around Central Europe, between the years of 1300AD and 1500AD, after having used the effectively as warhorses for a few hundred years.**",2016-05-08 09:21:18+00:00,d2x9q3g,1.0,t3_4ic63h,37092.0,AskHistorians

165,"Well, a hammer is useful until the screwdriver exists, so to speak.

But broadly, yes, methods like that worked, to a degree... but it caused issues. It made horses aggressive. It made training horses dangerous, and it made them reasonably untrainable. [Bits like this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/474x/2c/d5/33/2cd5337b38f06b2bb7300250796d6ea0.jpg) or similar to [this](http://875357559f655c0fd9842374.eventingnation.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/OldBit.jpg) were common, and it took a... careful rider to prevent things like rearing and spinning. At the same time, the horses were ""trained"" (i.e. tortured) into submission enough that they wouldn't fight back, because of the pain. Now of course, that isn't to say that this was universal. Good horsemanship has never ceased to exist, and there were always good riders, and soft riders, and riders that did not abuse their animals. But, this was more of the norm, all things considered.

And of course, there were spurs like [these](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Medieval_spurs.JPG), which would cause intense pain in a horse's flank- again, these were common in the medieval period. 

A lot of cruel training would cause injuries- but at the same time, a lot of injuries would be ignored, and the horse would be forced to work through the pain, or to ignore the pain.

Another, more philosophical answer to your question on efficacy is... what is the goal? Lots of cruel and horrid training exists even today that damages horses... but it gets the results that people want. Look at the process of chemically the legs of Tennessee Walking Horses, or the concept of Rolkur (hyperflexion) in dressage horses. They get the job done, and they're effective, but they aren't good for the horse...

And that's the beauty of a lot of Renaissance training! They started doing what they believed was good for the horse! The idea was to train, breed, and develop the horse into the best possible example of what he could be. The philosophy was one of natural stewardship and improvement of the animal for more than just what the human wanted. Training started to exist to better the animal...

You can see a spark of that in The 1st Duke of Newcastle's book title (and book), *A New Method and Extraordinary Invention to Dress Horses and Work them according to Nature*.

Working them according to nature is to work them in a way that is *aligned* with their nature- The core of the philosophy is to bring them along and to teach them how to do all of their natural movements in the most beautiful way. This is why, perhaps, for the longest time, work in hand was seen as one of the highest levels of training- as seen [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5a/d7/3e/5ad73ee15de3b95c1a41dc4e0009370b.jpg). While there still are all sorts of things attached to the horse, he is being conditioned in a way that is, as they claim, according to his nature. His head has freedom to move, he looks relaxed, and he has energy and movement.

Now, no training is entirely according to nature, but that's the nature of humans sitting on horses- nothing is natural about that, really, because wild horse didn't evolve to have humans ride them. But, life on this planet is strange, and so we have horse training.

166,"The treatment of horses was really quite... complicated in that particular time period, and there was a tremendous amount of writing and philosophy around it.

The late medieval treatment of horses was really quite terrible. Riders used cruel and painful bits, gigantic spurs with sharp points, and harsh training methods.

But, as the Renaissance came, people started reading and studying classical Greek texts, which they tried to apply to daily life. This happened with horses as well.

Primarily, they read Xenophon's ""On Horsemanship."" This stands as the philosophical and practical foundation of all modern horsemanship. He details things like grooming practices, the selection of a good horse, the training of horses, the care of the horse, and the necessity of humane and careful treatment of the horse.

Antoine de Pluvinel is often credited as the first of the classical French riding masters. While he learned from a rather cruel trainer, he advocated for the humane and ethical treatment of the animal, and believed that they should be trained in such a way that would elevate and improve upon the horse's natural tendencies.

With that in mind, there were many cruel riding masters. Federico Grisone, another master, once advised that, (paraphrase), ""When the horse will not go forward, one should take a cat, tie the cat to a pole, and then hold the pole in such a way that the cat may bite and scratch the horse in the legs and the flank."" His text, ""The Rules of Horsemanship"" detail his cruel methods first hand.

In any regard, horses were typically seen as something valuable, and, while not quite human, definitely special and able to be trained and educated in a way that they could be improved beyond any other animal. The training and breeding of horses was often considered one of the most gentlemanly and refined topics of conversation.

Sir Philip Sidney wrote this in his introduction to ""The Defense of Posey"":

&gt; Nay, to so unbelieved a point he proceeded, as that no earthly thing bred such wonder to a prince as to be a good horseman; skill of government was but a pedanteria in comparison. Then would he add certain praises, **by telling what a peerless beast the horse was, the only serviceable courtier without flattery, the beast of most beauty, faithfulness, courage,** and such more, that if I had not been a piece of a logician before I came to him, I think he would have persuaded me to have wished myself a horse.

(Emphasis mine).

Sidney is describing a riding lesson he had with a riding master. The riding master is singing the praises of the horse, and is expressing why the horse is such a valuable animal- to the point where being like a horse would almost be better than being a man.

Essentially, according to the riding master, the horse is the only employee one can have who does not think highly of himself, and who will work at any time, regardless of the circumstances, but will do so with all the good qualities of a good servant.",2016-05-05 18:54:29+00:00,d2u5gcz,1.0,t3_4hqd6j,164743.0,AskHistorians
167,"Horse care, like most anything else, varied wildly through pretty much every time period.

With that in mind, there were a few universal things.

Whilst on campaign, the cavalryman/trooper/dragoon/person riding the horse would typically be responsible for horse's day to day care. The individual would either know how to care for the horse from their knowledge in non-military life or would learn when placed in a cavalry unit. This kind of care included things like feeding grain, providing water, and ensuring that the horse has been groomed properly.

""Grooming"" in a loose sense involves all of the activities necessary for the daily maintenance of the horse. This would be cleaning the dirt and sweat from the horse's body and removing dirt and debris from the horse's feet. This might also entail things like the shortening of the main and tail, as well as washing the saddle cloths and cleaning the saddle, bit, and bridle.

In the field, grooming to make the horse look nice would often fall to the wayside when troopers were tasked with other, more important duties. However, practical care, like the removal of sweat from the horse's body, would be done regularly (if the horse sweats heavily and then is ""put away wet"", it can develop a number of negative health conditions). 

Troopers might carry some oats or grain with them for the horses, but more than a day's supply would become prohibitively heavy- a cavalry horse, working hard, needs a minimum of 8 pounds of grain or oats daily, not counting the need for hay and water.

Which brings up the point of feeding and watering- A trooper would carry a muzzle bag or grain bucket, from which oats or grains could be fed, and he would carry a water bag, so that he could water his horse when necessary. Officers would be responsible for finding appropriate places to stop the cavalry regiment for resupply and feeding. Ideally, they would stop near a body of water, to allow for the easy watering of the horses (a horse can drink 5 gallons in about two minutes if they're thirsty), and with grass, to allow for the grazing of the horse (grazing is when the horse eats forages for grass either at liberty or with the trooper holding the horse while the horse is haltered). With that in mind, grass is often poor food for horses. It can cause indigestion, if the horse's stomach isn't accustomed to that grass, it takes a while for the horse's to chew, and it takes a while for the horse to eat enough to get enough calories to replenish from the amount of work that they undergo while on campaign.

Beyond that, a supply train would be absolutely necessary to bring along necessities like hay and grain. High quality hay is definitely the preferred meal for a horse that is in heavy work. The average cavalry horse (using that term liberally), would need around 20 pounds of hay. However, hay, being expensive, could be partially substituted for straw, which was also fed. So, the daily feeding of the horse would be something like 10 pounds of hay, 10 pounds of straw, and 8-10 pounds of grain or oats, with grass whenever possible and water whenever possible.

Farriers would take care of all other necessary horse care actions in the field. The farriers would put shoes on the horses, trim the horse's feet (if necessary), file down the teeth (when coupled with a bit, irregular wear on the teeth [which are constantly growing] can cause pain in the horse's mouth), sew up wounds, treat scrapes and gashes, and ensure that the horses are not suffering from things like indigestion, colic, exhaustion, or whatever else. When necessary, a farrier would also be tasked with shooting a horse with a broken leg. After a battle, farriers would go through the field and shoot the horses too injured to continue moving.

When the horse was stabled in times of peace, they would spend much of their day at liberty or in a stall, and they might be subject to a few hours work as a hunt horse or a carriage horse. Alternatively, they might be a farm horse, but draught horses were typically disliked for military use.

**TL;DR**: Horse care is complicated, heavy, and expensive.

175,"The Mongolian ponies were very small- they're basically unchanged today from what they were 600 years ago. Most are under 14 hands high. They were hard, scruffy, and roughly trained animals. 

The European horse breeding program was considerably more sophisticated than anything the Mongolians had. The Europeans were developing things like stud books and breeds, whereas the average Mongolian breed for just speed and endurance. European horses were much taller (at the time, about 15-16hh). This corresponds to a significantly greater stride angle. http://www.somaxsports.com/photo.php?analysis=california_chrome

Basically, stride angle is what allows for speed in the gallop. It's essentially the amount of distance a horse can cover in a stride- and horses with longer legs have a longer stride as well as a bigger stride angle, which allows for a much faster horse. 

Europeans were less concerned with endurance in their warhorses, at least in the time of knights. A knight would ride his riding horse to the site of the battle, where he would then mount his war horse. Mongolians would have a string of ponies and use whichever was their favorite or the most fresh when they attacked. Basically, European horses were more purpose built- drafts for pulling, horses for riding, horses for war, horses for racing, etc. 

European horse training was also more developed, which comes naturally out of European style mounted warfare- close quarters combat and charges with polearms required very tuned, muscled horses that could be ridden with precision. 

A Mongolian horse was much less ""trained"" than a European horse. Basically, Mongolian ponies are trained to move off the riders legs and weight as the rider shoots his bow and arrow. There were Mongolian lancers, but they were much less prevalent than archers. The ponies were basically allowed to do what they wanted, provided that they basically traveled in the correct direction. Speed was more up to the horse than the rider. 

European horses were typically more temperature sensitive than Mongoloan ponies, but things like horse blankets tend to help with than. Regardless, horse combat in snow or ice is never advisable, especially with horse shoes, because the snow balls up in the horses' feet in such a way that they are prone to slipping. Mongolian horses did not have this problem. 

Arguably, the finest war horses in the world came from Arabia. The Arab horse is the foundation of almost every European breed- the thoroughbred breed can trace its lineage back to three Arabians imported hundreds of years ago. Europeans imported Arab stallions to build their breeds. The Arab was fast, smart, and had tremendous endurance. They were trainable, strong, and had a good temperament. 

The Duke of Wellington's favorite mount was an Arab named Copenhagen. He rode him throughout almost all of his campaigns against Napolean. Likewise, Napolean had a string of Arabians trained as his mounts- they were expertly trained and probably some of the best warhorses to have ever existed. 

No other horse really had the impact the Arabian on horse husbandry.

177,"That totally makes sense, and in a way, I really think that Kevin Smith fits in with the other directors on that list-

Smith's movies (well, his better movies) all have a stylistic tone that's consistent and familiar, but always flexible and adaptable to the story. His filmmaking tropes and formats always work to serve the end goal of the story, and he doesn't sacrifice the story to fit the format.

Like, Clerks 2 is a damn good movie- from the mirrored structure to the dialogue to the cinematography... it's really quite good. I'd even say it's a ""comic book movie"" in that it's a movie put together like a Frank Miller graphic novel (it's early in the morning here and I need to get to work, otherwise I'd explain my thinking more clearly- I can do that later...).

Or, Chasing Amy, which is still one of my favorite movies ever... it turns the ""rom com"" type love story so much on its head, and it's so genuine and honest and is probably one of the only movies produced in the 20 years that accurately depicts sexuality as a continuum and not just a static placement. The characterization in that movie is just so.... *good*, I don't know how else to describe it. All of the characters have histories, traumas, and emotions that they relate without just saying, 'I HAVE FEELINGS!"" and when they do talk about their feelings, they talk about them in the way that people would talk about them and not movie characters- it's awkward, people fuck up, and when the people fuck up, there's (Spoiler) no getting back together. The fuck ups tear everything apart and leave it there... but the movie still manages to end sweetly, and in a way that really resonates with me (I had a similar kind of amicable reunion with an ex a while back, where we aren't dating, but we're friends, but friends at a distance, after a fight that ended our relationship).

And his goofier movies have all the cinematic goodness and agonizing artistic love that many ""serious movies"" have- they're carefully edited, wonderfully written and acted, and meticulously created.

And that's the crux of why I think Kevin Smith is good- he *creates*. Like, he doesn't ever seem to just walk in to a movie he's making and shit something out for money.

Well, there is that, and cavalry and signals manuals refer to this exact issue. Basically, your flag commands have to be such that the enemy cannot understand them. Naturally, officers would study the cavalries of other nations, with the intent of understanding how to read their signals and counter their movements. Intelligence vs. counter intelligence and all that.

Beyond that, flags are hard to operate on horseback. You have two hands, and one hand is pretty much dedicated to controlling the horse. Anything bulky or big will get in the way. Hence, a small but loud trumpet or a sword to shake around. 

Really, trumpet calls would have been the most common way of communicating on a battlefield.

182,"Preface: this applies mostly to early modern cavalry, but is not necessarily wrong for cavalries of other eras.

Well, first things first, cavalry forces that conducted large scale charges drilled extensively. This meant that they practiced charges and maneuvers in smaller formations often. This allowed the officers to gain experience commanding their group of soldiers.

Essentially, a charge of that size would have to be planned ahead of time, and officers would be given orders. They would know their general area of responsibility, and they would be responsible for moving their men to that location.

In video game terms, think of grouping all of your individual cavalry units into hotkey groups. You have 100 horses per group, and you have 4 groups. Instead of telling all 400 where to go individually, you tell group 1, 2, 3, and 4 where to go, and then let the groups get there independently.

If the leader of all the groups needed to communicate something to everybody, he would have a few ways to do so. The most efficient way would be to use a bugle call. Bugle calls weren't just one sound- there were tons of different [calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVX2hSft94s), which signaled different messages. The officers and men would hear the bugle call and act accordingly. In a cavalry force that large, they might have to rely the bugle call with another trumpeter.

Another way to communicate would be to use flags. Flags have severe limitations within the cavalry and were somewhat prone to miscommunication, but they were not without place.

The cavalry officers might also communicate with hand signals. One officer sees the signal, then relays it to the next few officers. This could also be done with movements of the sword held above the head.

Alternatively, the general could send relay riders to the different groups. The relay rider would basically shout orders, and the army would play a large scale game of ""telephone.""

As you can see, communication here was not exactly precise- often, they used rough signals to relay basic messages quickly. The general had to have a talented group of officers to help rally his army and complete his tactical goals. Good officers made the difference between a successful attack and a failed one.

You could think of it kind of like American Football- the players know all of the plays, and they've practiced the plays repeatedly. However, they will not communicate with the coaches directly during the game. The quarterback might see a signal from the coach on the sidelines, and then the quarterback will tell the players what play they're using, and then he will help make sure the play is executed correctly. If something goes wrong, he can improvise and fix the play, or exploit a weakness in the other team and change the play on the fly. That's why good quarterbacks get paid a lot of money.

And finally, if the individual cavalryman didn't know what to do... he'd keep his head down and follow the guy in front of him and trust that his officer wasn't a moron.

I hope that helps!",2016-04-07 19:23:35+00:00,d1txuh2,1.0,t3_4drdog,16288.0,AskHistorians

190,"The massive German mechanization during WWII is something of a myth- a lot of supply train and material issues prevented a totally mechanized German army.

Armies tend to reform rather slowly, and the general mentality is that, ""If it ain't 'broke,' don't fix it."" The German army had tons and tons of horses, and they had a huge infrastructure in place dedicated to the breeding, use, and maintenance of horsepower.

Now, every German infantry battalion was supposed to have a mechanized supply line, but repair issues, fuel shortages, and general scarcity prevented the Germans from equipping every infantry battalion with a full compliment of trucks. Wars are big, and supply lines are extremely complicated- basically, you have to just find a way to get the equipment where it needs to go, regardless of how it gets there. If what you have is horses, then use the damned horses.

A lot of German strategists also underestimated the length of the war by a huge amount- they believed that with a short war, horses and rail lines with some trucks would suffice. This would allow them to prioritize the use of in demand war goods, like steel, petrol, rubber, ball bearings, and machine-time, to other pieces of military hardware.

And ultimately, as the German army rearmed and mobilized in the 1930s, they did so in a rather... unorganized fashion. As Larry T. Balsamo writes in his article, *Germany's Armed Forces in the Second World War: Manpower, Armaments, and Supply*, ""The German armed forces in 1939 can accurate be described as having been armed in breadth rather than depth.""

What this means is that the Germans had a lot of stuff, but it wasn't organized in a way that was consistent throughout the entire army. They lacked a clear goal when rearming, and ended with a mix of advanced and traditional military equipment and structure.

Moving on, the Americans had a much, much better industrial output, greater access to resources, more fuel, and a more cohesive logistical organization. The Americans were also able to supply weapons and vehicles to Britain and Russia (see the Lend Lease program), which greatly helped with the mechanization of the Allied forces.

The Germans certainly had a lot of tanks, and their tanks were (probably) better than Allied tanks, but the Allies were able to keep their equipment fueled, repaired, and supplied with ammunition much better.

tl;dr: German industrial superiority is something of a Wehraboo myth, and the Americans were way better at industry than the Germans- the Germans were probably better at building hardware, but the Americans were better at getting hardware to the places it needed to be, and the Americans made so much of their stuff that they could give it to their friends. German stuff was so expensive and required so much material to keep running that they couldn't even fully outfit their army with it. (Americans- boring but efficient. Germans- Cool but inefficient).

Now, my other post talks extensively about the ability of a TB to carry weight, as well as the fact that the thoroughbred did not exist at the time when knights rode in armor. However, the Arabian did exist.

The Ottoman Empire had lots of Arabian horses. Almost all of the riding horses of the Ottoman Empire were of the Arabian variety. Here's the [armor and barding of an Ottoman knight](http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/files/styles/fullsize/public/images/ottoman-mamluk-1550.jpg?itok=PDsbOTMI).

Height and weight are not the defining features of a ""war horse."" See my post below about Destriers and coursers and whatever else. 

Now, there were some knights who rode horses that were called Friesians, but those horses were undoubtedly different in many, many ways from the Friesians that we see today. The Friesian Horse Association of North America talks about Friesians as being cart horses. The high knee action, feathering, expressive trot, and high neck carriage makes for a *bad* warhorse, and definitely not anything that a knight or a soldier would have willingly ridden into battle.

According to the Duke of Wellington, a horse that was above 15.2hh was a large warhorse, and below that was about average.

In the Napoleonic era, horses were not that large. In the time of knights, they were even smaller. 15-15.2hh would have been about the size of any warhorse. Any bigger, and you have a draught horse, and no knight of any stature would go into battle on the equine equivalent of a tractor.

208,"Could a thoroughbred carry a knight? Likely not, because the thoroughbred as we understand it didn't exist at the time when knights rode in plate armor.

In the Medieval era, knights rode a multitude of horses. Horses weren't categorized by breeds. They were categorized by type- think more of a class of horse, really.

Wealthier knights would ride something called a destrier, which was a large, imposing, and strong horse- something closer to a warmblood than a draught horse, like a Friesian. 

Basically, a good destrier would look like [this](http://www.horsemanpro.com/Site/gallery/album2/image5.jpg).

Note the lack of feathering on the legs, the uphill build, and the good neck set. A Frisian looks impressive, but he has a number of qualities that make him patently unsuitable for use as a military horse, namely the feathering, the piss poor neck set, the strange back shape, the absolutely atrocious quality of the canter and gallop (try riding one- they're awful to ride), and the lack of maneuverability of the breed as a whole.

A destrier would be picked from the strong, fast, nimble, and well built colts. Breeders would pick strong dams and good stallions, and breed for the qualities of a good horse based on the job that was necessary.

All of these horses were much smaller and narrower than a Friesian. In fact, they looked like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barding#/media/File:Dresden-Zwinger-Armoury-Armor.02.JPG). There's some historical barding. The horse is narrow, and the knight's legs hang down rather far.

Anyway. As for a thoroughbred carrying a knight's weight, a mature and well conditioned thoroughbred can carry 200 pounds. If the weight is in the form of a well trained and well balanced rider in a saddle that fits and distributes weight properly, a larger thoroughbred could carry 240-250 pounds at a gallop without any major issues. Riding with that much weight on campaign might cause difficulties, but a knight would have a string of horses and assistants carrying his equipment, and his charger would be ponied (led from a rider on a different horse) by a squire, so the charger would be fresh.

Anyway. Long story short, a thoroughbred *could* hypothetically carry a knight in full plate armor.

**BACK TO THE POINT** God^this^is^getting^out^of^hand.


OP asked more about early modern history, with lines of infantry and Napoleonic tactics. Nothing like a Friesian would have been brought on campaign by a Napoleonic army. They would ride: thoroughbreds, Arabians, Hanoverians, Trakehners.

So what was the preferred horse of the cavalry? Well, from most accounts, it seems to be the tiny little Arabian horse, because of the intelligence, maneuverability, and endurance of the breed. 

Otherwise, they would ride (guess!) something like an off the track [thoroughbred](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Cornet_Wilkin_11th_Hussars.jpg) or find either what was locally available.

ALSO- as for Thoroughbreds not being all that big... The Jockey Club (the international organization that tracks thoroughbred bloodlines) states that the average size of a thoroughbred is 16.1 at the withers, and about 1000lbs at race weight, which is more when the horse is conditioned for riding (the muscles for running and the muscles for carrying weight are different).",2016-03-15 22:59:32+00:00,d118hhd,,t1_d116owb,2630.0,AskHistorians

Here's a thirteenth century painting of a mounted knight: 

https://40.media.tumblr.com/3a1cc2f6ff44b2f3ef39d1f63a14fae0/tumblr_nbhv94bLG61tbghqao1_500.jpg

(yes, the link is tumblr, but the image is of a real painting. Note the deep seat, long stirrups, loose reins, and bridle without cavesson.

Now, compare that to the 19th century portrait of Frederick William III of Prussia:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Franz_Kr%C3%BCger_-_Equestrian_Portrait_of_Frederick_William_III_-_WGA12294.jpg

Note the very modern looking position of the rider. The stallion is, more or less, in collected canter. Freddy Bill's legs are underneath his hip, his hands are low, and he's balanced. This is the ideal position of a rider during that time period. 

There are a couple of interesting details here. The horse is clearly a stallion. Because the portrait is of a king, the artist wanted to show the king's absolute control over the beast, and by extension, his kingdom. It show's that his natural state is one of authority and command. He's also holding the reins of the double bridle in the classical fashion, where the snaffle reins are held under the pinky fingers of the right and the left hand, and the left and right curb reins are held under the ring finger and middle finger of the left hand respectively.

Col. Alois Podhajsky of the Spanish Riding School in Vienna and officer in the Austrian cavalry describes this as the correct way of holding the reins in his text, *The Complete Training of Horse and Rider.* One can also see that the curb rein is held tighter than the snaffle- the old method of riding with the double is to ride entirely off the lightest aides in the curb, while functionally ignoring the snaffle. Contemporary dressage has reversed this, where a good rider is capable of riding entirely off the snaffle while ignoring the curb.

Now, your rank and file cavalry soldier would likely be issued something more like a Pelham bit with a curb mouth piece. Basically, the bit would be something akin to a polo bit.

They would hold all four reins in one hand, in whatever way worked for them.

220,"Sorry this is late!

Knights and the later regiments of horse rode *very* differently.

Knights rode in a very deep seat, in saddle with a high pommel and cantle. They had long stirrups, and you keep their legs forward. Typically, they would sit the trot. For pleasure, they would ride horses that were somewhat similar to gaited horses. But, they would always sit the trot.

Cavalry regiments of the Napoleonic era started experimenting more with shorter stirrup lengths and the lighter, more forward seat meant for riding across country (or, as we say, cross country). Riding long (i.e. long stirrups) was seen as more proper, but when training a large regiment of cavalry they would typically teach the soldiers to ride short (with shorter stirrups).

When riding short, soldiers would post the trot because it made riding longer distances somewhat easier. However, much cavalry movement was done at the walk. Sometimes, even a charge would be done at the trot.

Now, (DISCLAIMER) this is somewhat apocryphal, but I've heard it repeated a few times by word of mouth, and so I'll add it here for flavor. When militaries would ride long distances, the soldiers would change their rising diagonal every 15 minutes to allow for even wear on the horse's hind legs.

That said, it would not be implausible to see officers and those with extensive riding experience sitting the trot. But, many cavalry men were tremendously *bad* riders, and the horse was basically a way to get them to the fight quickly.",2016-03-03 05:55:53+00:00,d0lqel4,1.0,t3_464b4x,1331308.0,AskHistorians

230,"I really like the ""80's"" Cap the most. It makes him look like a soldier and less like a cartoon. I know that the movies are comic book movies, but they're supposed to be comic book movies adapted to real life- and I think costume design should reflect that. 

Really, I think that's what's bothered me the most about the MCU lately- it's a little stuck between cartoon and live action, and it did not find a good place to rest... 

Like, the first Iron Man rocked. It was Tony Stark fighting bad guys that we could kind of believe. It's something more relatable. The first Captain America movie was that way too. It was a movie with a believable look that stayed pretty much out of the uncanny valley of movies, with the comic parts tastefully included in a way that added flavor without being ridiculous. 

But the Avengers, and Captain America just kinda got crazy. Like, Captain America is basically Spider-Man without the webs- he's a parkour expert who punches people out while wearing a jumpsuit. Yes, that's basically what the comics are like, but I feel like the Cap in the comics is more complex. 

The ""80's"" Cap was a nice reinvention. He carried a .45 with his shield. He dressed like he was from the 1940's. He acted like a soldier, and he was a believable comic book soldier. Despite the push to universalize the Avengers heroes, Captain America is the spirit of the American military, and I don't feel like he's being portrayed like that in the films lately. With that in mind, The Winter Soldier was cool in how it showed the establishment turning on its veterans and not supporting them, but the message was kind of diluted to push a new villain, instead of doing something truly interesting (just a movie about Cap v. SHIELD). 

Civil War is compelling because it's Cap (American Army) fighting Stark (American industrial complex). It pits the military industrial complex against itself. I'm not sure how compelling it will be now that Stark has nothing to do with manufacturing weapons and Cap has nothing to do with the American military.

3-4 is usually fine. With the young horses, the more time you spend working on obedience, the better. Skills like leading, blanketing, haltering, and safe and controlled in hand showing are all good things to have before trying to back your colt.

Play with saddle pads. Put them on his back, gently rub him with them, fling them around, whatever, until he really just doesn't care what you're doing with them. 

Practice leading up to a mounting block. Get somebody to hold the colt, stand on the mounting block, and gently pat his back, neck, and butt. Emphasis that he is NOT to move a foot at any point. Mounting babies is the most dangerous part of backing them, IMO.

Work on yielding to pressure instead of fighting against it.

That said, in my opinion, the difference between this and more traditional training with the bo is kind of like the difference between [this](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02302/lindh_2302855k.jpg) and [this](http://www.knightsofmiddleengland.com/_gallery-image.aspx?ID=1556).

Neither of them are ""real,"" and neither is any more or less legitimate than the other. The difference is, one resembles art a bit more, and the other resembles fighting a bit more.  

Your kid's performance resembles art. It resembles art in the way that any normal child of his age does art- i.e., poorly. There are kids who are way more athletic than your kid, who put way more energy into their dance, and who probably spend way more time training than your kid. And that's ok. If he's happy, has friends, and does well in school, nothing else really matters- especially not the opinion of bumblefucks like me on Reddit. But since you asked...

He has fast hands, which are impressive, I guess, but nothing that he does connects- that is, there is no suggestion or indication of impact.

What does that mean? When I think of bo, I think of this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcO5MZe7xe0

Very few people have that level of skill, but it's a good example of a weapons form. It's a good example because the practitioner demonstrates impact, force, and motion. His movements are logically connected in a way that tells a story- if you look, you can start to see how the movements in that video could be applied to a real fight.

Your son just kind of spins the weapon around quickly. That's fine, but what does it show? It isn't showing a fight, nor is it showing the moves to a fight. It isn't showing any kind of story, and to be entirely honest, your son isn't athletic enough right now for that to be interesting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZQWYMnI-KE

Again, I know that your child is just a child. But, his performance isn't necessarily ""good"" just for the sake of him being a child. It is a good attempt for a child, but, compared to what is ""good,"" this is not.

With that in mind, here are some things that you child could do to improve his performance: 

* Add energy. He needs to look like he wants to be there performing. He needs to bring a huge amount of athletic energy to the table. Even the potential for it without using it is better than showing up asleep. And honestly, he looked asleep.

* Unless he has a spinal injury, he needs to stand up straight.No exceptions. Hunching looks sloppy and competitive judges hate it.

*  His ki-ai/shout at the end sucked. No other word for that. In the entertainment realm, he needs to be way more dramatic.

* Even though he's going for speed, his strikes have to have some indication of impact- if you watch closely, you can see that he pulls every strike about three inches early. It interrupts the flow of the weapon and makes the entirely performance look kind of choppy- think of a musician who cut the last note out of every line from their sheet music. The average layman might not know the specific issue, but they would know something was wrong. Same goes for this.

* He needs to breathe.

* Slow down parts of the performance. Make it 45 seconds, add in two stops and slowed down section, and this would start to be pretty decent.

Anyway. That's enough from me. Be proud of your kid for sticking through with this for the 3-6 years he spent getting to this point. He'll get there.

If you don't like the structure of Karate organizations, that's cool, but your rant makes you sound petty. It makes you sound like a neckbeard that would be featured on /r/iamverysmart.

There is no ""true way of Karate."" Karate itself is an institution. It's an organization, and it's a collective of people who agree, more or less, on the dance moves that make it what it is.

Karate does not exist in nature, and you will not find Karate through some Cartesian revelation- that is, you won't discover Karate on your own. It just doesn't work that way. If you want to learn Karate, you have to learn it from somebody.

Now,

&gt; Those on the path should understand that they hold no authority over each other either, as they necessarily recognise their own fallibility.

Do you understand your own fallibility? Do you understand why the authority figures wouldn't let you grade? It's because you failed. You didn't play by the rules. You only got to grade because your father was in charge of the club, which is kinda pathetic.

If you aren't going to class, then of course they aren't going to let you test and get your belts.

What is it that you want? Do you want to just walk in and have them tell you, ""You're awesome, here's your black belt""?

400,"A charge is a pretty limited and specialized event. A chariot charge would basically only happen in a prepared battlefield or an ideal field. Sure, they're effective under ideal circumstances, but that doesn't mean that they're ideal uniformly.

Light Cavalry and chariots were basically skirmishes who would cover flanks and pursue routed enemies. Occasionally, a charge could be used to break a line, if the line was weak to begin with. Chariots have to be moving to be effective. Same with cavalry. If your dudes with horses are standing still, they're likely going to die quickly. If you charge into the mass of enemies with your expensive pony and your expensive chariot, you run the risk of getting stuck and not being able to get out or maneuver away- especially if you charge with many other chariots. 

We don't really know when people decided that sitting on the horses worked better, but somebody figured out how to make it work, and it took off from there. By the time Greeks were bustling about, cavalry was a better choice. 

Alexander would just open his ranks and let the chariots pass when they came. He'd then attack them from behind when they could turn. ",2015-10-09 23:09:20+00:00,cvu9it3,3.0,t1_cvu924b,848.0,AskHistorians

402,"Arguably, a few changes helped the cavalry replace the chariot.

The first is that horses were starting to be bred bigger and with combat in mind- Xenophon talks extensively about finding a good warhorse for riding in his text, ""The Art of Horsemanship."" He references a now lost text by Simon on charioteering, but he made it sound as if the chariot was already becoming obsolete.

Next, a chariot has some pretty major flaws. First of all, an old style chariot with wooden wheels and no suspension system would be bouncy as fuck. Get in a red flyer wagon and role down a hill, Calvin and Hobbs style. That's what the experience would be like.

When you are on the back of a horse, it's much easier to deal with rough terrain. Additionally, it allows you to traverse more types of terrain. You can ford rivers, go up and down hills, make tighter turns, and go through brush with much greater ease.

A chariot also requires more horses, so you have a greater risk of loss. It also increases the necessary logistics train to supply them.

Another key development is the saddle. While we don't know exactly when the saddle came into existence, there were proto-saddles in Central Asia and the Middle East circa 500BCE. The saddle allowed soldiers to carry equipment and sit on the horse with more comfort.

The Battle of Mons Graupius (~84CE) is the latest account of chariot use in warfare that I can find... and apparently they didn't do so well.",2015-10-09 19:09:30+00:00,cvu0o75,1.0,t3_3o0rtc,79200.0,AskHistorians

Seriously though, the government cannot make laws that infringe upon your right to do things protected by the constitution. 

Let's substitute the 2nd Amendment for a different right.

You have the right to freely express your religion. But the government tells you what constitutes a religion, it tells you when you can express your religion, it tells you how often you can express your religion, and it tells you how much you can donate to your religion. Because seriously, who needs to donate *that* much money to a church, anyway? Who needs to go to church that often?

Alternatively, who does any newspaper need to publish more than three articles about public officials per week? Why do they need to have newspapers more than fifteen pages long? Excessively sized newspapers are bad for the environment, anyway.

Now, what is a need, anyway? Ask her to define a ""need"" for anything within the Bill of Rights. Do black people and women ""need"" to vote? Do you ""need"" to be able to freely express your religion? Do you ""need"" your right to remain silent? Do you ""need"" to be protected from unnecessary searches? Do you really ""need"" a lawyer to defend your self in that fair trial (which you probably don't need).

Arguably, no, you don't ""need"" any of these things. But they're still protected because you have a **right** to them. They're called rights because you are obligated to them- some of the founding fathers were against putting anything about the bill of rights in the Constitution because they thought that those ten basic things *were really fucking obvious* and they were afraid that if they were written down, people would become pedantic about it. 

And here we are.

Anyway. That was a ways out of the way.

Also, the highway is government owned property. They can dictate the speed limit. On your property, they cannot limit the speed. If you want a private race track, and you have the means to do so, the government cannot stop you from building one and going faster than 70 miles per hour. If the government owned a shooting range and allowed people to come and shoot, then sure, they could arguably limit the magazine size on said range. But that's *really* beside the point.

492,"Howdy! I'm not sure if your questions were answered during the AMA, but I'll answer a few.

The most common saddle of the Civil War was the 1859 McClellan saddle. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McClellan_saddle#/media/File:McCellan_Saddle_Fort_Kearny_2006_B.jpg

The McClellan saddle was kind of a hybrid of a few different types of European and American cavalry saddles. The Confederates used a mix of military and civilian saddles, depending on what they could find.

Cavalry mounts also typically had a fair amount of hardware on them. The average Union cavalry horse wore a crupper, a breast collar, a running martingale, a bridle, and a Model 1859 Curb Bit.

You can see what this looks like here: http://www.forensicgenealogy.info/images/comanche_general_sherman.jpg

Some troopers had a slightly different assortment of tack. They might not have a crupper (the usefulness of which was somewhat debated by leading European cavalry experts [see Francis Dwyer's book, ""Seats and Saddles""), and they might have had a standing martingale attached to a halter that was underneath the horse's bridle. In that circumstance, the bridle would have been worn without a noseband or cavesson.

http://hglanham.tripod.com/uscavalry/4664a.jpg

Stirrups were kind of a mixed bag. Some saddles had large fenders with big, wooden stirrups with toe caps. Others, like General Grant's saddle, had basic ""English"" style irons and leathers.

As for saddle pads, most troopers were issued a thick wool blanket, entirely similar to the modern day style western saddle blanket.

And of course, saddles were equipped with a variety of bags and scabbards for rifles, carbines, sabers, equipment, and whatever else the trooper was issued and decided to keep.

Really, the tack they used then isn't *too* different from modern equipment. If you were to take a look at a tack room from 1860, you'd be able to identify almost everything there without issue.",2015-07-13 15:06:56+00:00,ct1r7qb,1.0,t3_3c2f6k,820005.0,AskHistorians

Basically, it depends on literally everything- the training of the horse, the breeding of the horse, the age, the temperament, the location, the quality, the color, the conformation, etc.

A good horse could be almost obscenely expensive. A mediocre horse was reasonably obtainable. But the real expensive part of horse ownership was, and has always been, the upkeep of the animal over time.

499,"The special services groups had a lot more freedom to choose sidearms than normal infantry. They were also issued weapons that were different from that of the normal infantry. Note the Thompson SMG in the background. This Thompson is different from the American issued Thompson M1. It has the original forward pistol grip, compensator, and drum magazine.

These were commercially produced weapons that were quite expensive at the time: $200USD. They were issued only to special units, like this one.

The British military also didn't issue a semi-auto sidearm, and many officers carried German and American made weapons. Some used 1911s in .455 Webley, and many used Lugers, like in the photo above. Lugers were relatively common bring-backs from the first world war.

The soldier is likely carrying the Luger because of the extended ""snail"" magazine, which I believe held 50 rounds- an exceptional amount, which would have made the sidearm a formidable weapon in close quarters.",2015-07-01 02:34:33+00:00,cso9qo2,3.0,t1_csmhoqy,123877.0,HistoryPorn
