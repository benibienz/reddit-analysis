* Sweep up after yourself. I am not your damned mother. Nothing pisses me off more than watching you destroy the aisle I literally just made beautiful.

* Keep track of your horse's grain. I shouldn't have to travel to the ends of the earth to find you and tell you to buy more grain.

* Don't use stuff that doesn't belong to you. I have to field the complaints, and I can't really fix that issue all that well.

* Don't talk about things when you don't know the answer. If I'm talking to another client and you butt in and interrupt me with false information because you want to feel special, I WILL refer to you as ""that bitch"" to all of the other hands... or ""perra loca.""

* Visit your horse more than twice a week. If you only ever come out to ride the horse that you own or have a full lease on, *you are a bad person*. I don't care what happens in your life. Your horse gets lonely. That means I feel bad and spend my time comforting your poor, neglected pony.

* I probably hate your dog. Your dog barks, it spooks the horses, it shits, and you don't clean it up. That's why the barn rules clearly state, ""NO DOGS."" Yes, that rule applies to you. (Note- I like dogs in normal life).

* When the heaters are on in the tack room and the bathroom, close the goddamn doors. It's expensive to heat this shit.

* Don't want board to go up? STOP BREAKING BARN PROPERTY

* Try to remember my name/face. If I see you at the grocery store and you don't remember who I am when I smile and say hi, I'm much less likely to help you load your trunk and hay into your trailer when you go to shows (that is NOT my job, by the way). For fucks sake, I take care of your horses. You can at least bother to learn my name.

* You probably don't groom your horse right

* You almost certainly don't polo wrap/standing wrap correctly.

* Your horse hates all of the shit we have to put on him for turnout. Flysheets, flymasks... they hate that shit. I'll gladly flyspray your pony for you....

* Buy a halter that fits your horse's head.

* If you only ride two days a week, you only need two pairs of breeches.

* When you're in a lesson, wear a polo shirt and a sports bra. Nothing says ""I'm looking for attention!"" like having your tank top fall off in a jump lesson. Seriously, there aught to be a dress code....

* Lastly... I know more about your horse than you. I spend WAY more time around him. I probably spend way more time with horses than you.

My fiancé and I had plans to visit my family in a different part of the state. As usual, I was carrying a firearm- in this case, my [G19, in an IWB holster](http://i.imgur.com/b3WnoeA.jpg) (normally, the shirt goes over the gun).

About five minutes into the drive, I brought my vehicle to a quick stop as a vehicle in front of me suddenly stopped at a crosswalk. The woman driving behind me was not paying attention (apparently she was trying to dial her phone) and rear ended me.

My fiancé and I were fine. I exited my vehicle to check on the other woman, and she looked like she was in shock. I called 911, but an officer happened to be driving by and stopped to deal with the situation. The woman in the other vehicle was shaken up, but she was not injured.

Oregon is not a duty to inform state, but when the police officer asked for my driver's license, I handed her my CHL as well. When she saw it, she asked me, ""Are you carrying right now?"" I told the officer that I was, and she asked me politely to remove my firearm and to place it in my vehicle. I removed the firearm and holster from my belt and placed in the back seat of the vehicle, where the officer could see it. She looked at it, thanked me for being compliant, and went about her investigation in a polite manner without making any sort of fuss about the firearm.

This is not an exciting story. However, it is one possible outcome to a ""What if I'm carrying and X happens"" situation.",CCW,My first interaction with an LEO while carrying a firearm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/4j1lr1/my_first_interaction_with_an_leo_while_carrying_a/

""Overnight, Ph.D.s were liberated from KP duty, masters of science were recalled from orderly service, mathematicians were hauled out of bakeries, and precision mechanics ceased to be truck drivers.""

— Dieter K. Huzel, Peenemünde to Canaveral

Basically... Why was the Osenburg List necessary? Why weren't the educated individuals found and used earlier?

Thankfully, they car was still working, but the thieves took the radio, the paperwork, some of the medical supplies that we had, a horse-mane braiding kit (my fiance shows horses), and some horse blankets.
