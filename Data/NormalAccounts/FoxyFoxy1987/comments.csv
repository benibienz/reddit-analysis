&gt;a morbidly obese blob is her son?


I guess so.

&gt;and even started to sleep waddle to the kitchen to stuff himself before rolling back to bed,

GET THIS KID SOME HELP

&gt;he didn't really take notice of the growing layer of chub that coated his body

So wait, when Asgore IS home, does he notice?

&gt;Nowadays, he couldn't even waddle more than from his bed to the kitchen before needing a break

GET THIS KID SOME FUCKING EXERCISE

&gt;as when he waddled his chubby legs rubbed together, forcing him to waddle in a way that made his jiggly fat wobble in an almost erotic way, 

CHILD PORN ALERT

&gt;Getting up normally was out of his possibilities

So this kid is I dunno, 9, 7, maybe 6? And he is having trouble getting out of bed?

&gt;he couldn't even get into a good sitting position without the fat pressing onto his crotch,arousing him.

CHILD PORN ALERT AGAIN

&gt;Toriel giggled, finishing off the pie

WHY DID SHE GIGGLE HOLY FUCK

&gt;He was trying to roll over to get on his feet.. He need the food..

First off, grammar error, Second off, WHY DOES HE HAVE TO CONSUME 24/7?

&gt;
The smell was mouthwatering, and his tummy was growling loudly,jiggling and slapping against his legs as he tried getting up

So wait, his stomach is a separate entity? ^^THAT ^^EXPLAINS ^^A ^^LOT

&gt; He could barely stand on his legs

THIS KID IS 6-10, KEEP IN MIND.

&gt;but hd needed the food...

Who is hd? Is that the stomach's name?

&gt;i am coming.. slowly..

That could be taken out of context **VERY** easily.

&gt;Toriel watched her fat child waddle down the stairs. She saw how hard it was for him, but watched his fat wobble and jiggle with every step,slapping against his legs.

CHILD PORN AND INCEST ALERT!

&gt;His mouth started to water.... He was drooling already at the sight of her amazin pies.

Amazin pies? Yum, amazin is my favorite pie flavor!

&gt;oh you're the best.. you really take care of me

Is it just me or is the way he is speaking sounding like the way Napstablook speaks

&gt;Yes..feed me mom..i cant move my arms to reach the plate..
Please mommy..

NO NO NO NO NO

&gt;She really wanted to see him stuff himself to his limit, she loved seeing him in a state where it hurt so much that he begged for belly rubs just to ease the pain of overeating that much.
she waited patiently. Upon thinking about how fat her son was getting, she imagined how fat she would make him.. Her beautiful, fatty, flabby, soon obese son..

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO PLEASE 

&gt;i feel like i am bigger today..
you feed me soo good~
I get bigger every day mommy~♥

KILL MEEEEE

that's about all that is interesting in this.

867,"Mike shifted uncomfortably in his chair and quickly looked at the security monitor. Bonnie seemed to be in the supply closet, not doing anything threatening, but he was seriously scaring him with his constant twitching and staring. Mike picked up the soda that rested on his desk and took a long sip.  
   Sighing, Mike spoke to himself and said,  
    "" I don't believe this... The contract said nothing about crazy animatronics trying to kill me..."" 
   He quickly checked the time. 2 am. This was impossible. 
      He looked at the monitor again. ""No. This can't be!"", he thought to himself. Chica was nowhere to be seen. ""Where could she go?! She's not in the kitchen... Not in the party room... Damnit!"", Mike said after taking another long sip of his soda. 
     He felt his legs beginning shake as he reached over to the right door light and pressed it. Chica's horrifying face  was lit up in the doorway, and her eyes stared straight into Mike's. 
     ""Shit!"", Mike yelled as he hurriedly and clumsily clambered over to the door switch. He slammed his hand down on the button and then collapsed into his chair, his heart beating much quicker than normal.  
     He suddenly became aware of the slight but growing pressure in his bladder. He began to panic and noticed that his legs had started to jiggle up and down. 
       ""No... Not now..."", Mike moaned as he gripped the edge of his desk.  
  ""Ok, I'll be ok. I just have to sprint down the hall, go to the bathroom real quick, and then run back... I can do this!"" 
   Mike looked out of the left doorway and saw nothing but darkness for a few seconds. But he suddenly heard laughter in the hallway. Footsteps echoed and sounded like they were coming towards him. 
    No. No, no, no, seeing whatever animatronic that was down that hallway made him break out in a cold sweat, and getting to the bathroom was not at all worth it. 
    He quickly went back inside the office and checked outside the door. To his dismay, Chica was still there, watching him, taunting him. 
      He checked the time. Still 2 am. 
Mike sank into his chair. The pressure in his bladder had gotten worse. At this rate, there was no way he could last the night. 
        He knew was alone, ( except for the animatronics of course) so he slowly slid his hands in between his legs. His cheeks began to turn red as he pressed his hands on his crotch harder. That made the pressure go away for a while, and he finally remembered to check the monitors. 
       Throughout the rest of the night, Mike checked the monitors, closed the doors when Bonnie, Chica, or Foxy showed up, and just generally kept the animatronics away from him. 
     It was finally 5 am, and Mike had 3% battery to spare. His bladder was on the verge of bursting and his legs were knocking back together a lot faster than they were earlier. 
      ""Just one more hour... If I can through this last hour I can go to the bathroom...""   
         2% was left now. His bladder was practically bursting to release itself.  1% was left now, and the lights began to flicker. His hands were permanently pressed on to his crotch, but something suddenly happened to make him jump out of his chair.  
      The power went out. His breathing became heavier and his eyes grew wider. 
        Toybox music began to play after a few seconds, and a pair a bright blue luminescent eyes appeared.
          Mike was so frightened he couldn't even scream. His hands fell away from his crotch as he tried to push his chair as far away from the left doorway as possible. 
        The music continued to play as Mike sat terrified in his chair, unable to move. A warm wetness began to spread across his crotch and cascade down his legs. His knees began to knock together again as his bladder emptied on to his legs and chair.  
         Mike's eyes filled with tears and his cheeks burned as he finished emptying his once- filled bladder. 
       Just before the music ended, the clock bell rang, indicating that it was finally 6 am. With the bell, the music then stopped, and the eyes disappeared. 
      He slowly got up from his chair and tried to calm himself, but he was trembling. 
     Mike started to gather up his jacket and other things off of his desk and walk of the building. He wrapped his jacket around his waist to avoid anyone from the morning shift seeing his little ""accident"" 
      Mike murmured to himself,"" Only four nights left to go... I should probably get some protection or something for the rest of the week...""
