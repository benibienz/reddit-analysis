So I'll talk about it instead. Essentially, I've had this block for some weeks now, just steadily worsening until everything ground to a halt. A couple of weeks ago I was deep in comic-sketching territory, with a bunch of little projects on the side. For the past few week I haven't been able to draw anything past basic, forced sketches:

As you can probably guess, I'm a furry artist, but I also dabble in humans. I draw as much SFW as I do NSFW, a range of scenarios and angles and such, with the only constant factor being living, sentient beings. Which, I think, is where my art block comes in -- too much of the same.

The problem is, I don't like drawing backgrounds or environments, and I never learned to draw machines or anything similar. Not much helped by living in Australia, and having data caps in effect -- ref pictures may as well be their own currency. I haven't used a ref in years.

The problem isn't purely digital, either, as I haven't been able to draw anything traditionally for about a week and a half.

I was able to draw up some semi-realistic bricks for a game I've been planning for a long time, but as soon as I tried to apply myself to some character work, my mind shut down and refused to do anything even remotely close to artwork.

I haven't written in several months, and inspiration/motivation are distant memories. Painting isn't really my thing, either, and I have nowhere to actually practice it anyway.

There's no art schools or anything within walking distance (don't drive), no artist meetups, nothing. My only physical friends are some hour and a half drive away, and being that neither art artists...

The first time was a few months after leaving my ex (now three years ago). Eating became optional, sleep was 17 hours a day, you know how it goes.

If I had to pin down a reason, it's a long-term friend getting into a relationship a few weeks ago, which I know I should be happy about, but... we don't speak anywhere near as much as we used to, now. He was the only one I trusted enough to open up to completely. With that gone, it quickly welled up. I've lost all patience with art and games, I'm lashing out at everything - I kicked a chair (which hurt like hell) out of my room because I didn't want to throw it... then threw it anyway. A fucking *chair*.

Then tonight, something broke. All the sadness, all the rage, any kind of emotion at all, it all just stopped. I just want to sleep, or die, or go into a coma. I want to cut every tie I have to anyone or anything (which I may end up doing, anyway).

I've never seen a counsellor or psych about this, because opening up to people is a long and risky process. Bundled with my anxiety, I don't even have the guts to make an appointment. I just... I don't know where to go from here. I feel like I've got nothing left, either to live for or to fuel me, and I know I've been getting worse through the years. I can feel it, read it in my posts, see it in myself. The only times I've ever been truly happy are in a relationship. As you can guess, it's a bit hard to find a girl willing to put up with me, and even rarer are the girls that are actually into girls with a mind and spirit as broken as mine.

I don't know if there's anything left to type. I don't even know if anyone is going to see this, or reply.",BPD,I've hit rock bottom... again. (Possible triggers),https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/4q45ta/ive_hit_rock_bottom_again_possible_triggers/

The Elder Dragons are giving me hell, and not in the 'I'M GETTING TRIPLECARTED BLUGH' way. I'm running out of time. I'm playing as aggressively as I can (hammer/charge blade/long sword), managed to take out Akantor with 2:37 left on the clock, Dah'ren Mohran was repelled when I timed out, and both Kushala and Teostra simply failed me. I took on caravan Teostra for... I believe the Cowardly Palico? I took him out with a few precious minutes to spare.

I've tried abusing elemental weaknesses, high raw, high sharpness, armour skills... I always eat for the damage negation skill and Riser, because they've saved my bacon more times than I can count. I've got a R5 Hammer relic that's about 900 raw with 260 dragon, but only green sharpness, which is leading me to think I'll have to grind Guild Quests for a couple of days to get a decent weapon (and maybe armour).

The only things slowing me down that I can think of are Teostra's Blastblight and Kushala's wind. The downside being Biology is Gore/S (massive fire weakness) and Windproof is PinkRath (whom I never want to see again). As you may have guessed, online play is off the table, and I don't know anyone local with the game.

Essentially, I need tips.

I draw when I can, but it's become more of a struggle in the past week. Video games are very hit or miss, and most times can't hold my interest for more than an hour at most. I've had depression for some 13 or so years now (and possibly borderline), as well as anxiety, but I've figured out ways to combat all but the worst of it. I thought I was doing good, until...

I can't confirm it's the driving reason, but my best friend recently got a girlfriend, and as such, our online intimacy had to stop. It was also my only source of it, as well as constant conversations, which have dived through the floor as he's offline more and more.

I feel like I've lost all my fight. A few weeks ago I was playing games on the hardest difficulty, or in challenge modes, or similar. I was planning huge projects for my art. Now a single fail in games puts me off for days and my projects have fallen to the side. I honestly don't know where to go from here. I have a few other friends, yes, but they treat me as more of a casual friend. The past few days, I've continuously willed myself back to sleep, just to stay in bed longer, because feeding my dog and letting her out aside, I feel like my days have nothing to look forward to. It probably goes without saying I'm single, have no kids, etc. I've come to terms with both of these things likely being permanent, but...

I guess I just hate the thought of losing my best friend?

I don't have anyone else to turn to, or enough fans of my work to ask for help. I'm not really holding my breath awaiting help, either. I just needed to vent somewhere.

I'm sure someone will remember my Pink Rathian thread. Either way, I fought my way through 5* GH (solo), rocking Regios S set with Divine Protection and the Charge Blade of the same monster. Khezu was a pain in the ass, but went down to enough dodging. Gore Magala and Frenzied Tigrex were harder, but in the end, went down. And I'm getting off-track.

Okay.

I ate for Defender (Hi) and Def Up L, as I always do. I went through three monsters before this fight, previously farmed Caravan Black G. for his armour, and am just really familiar with the Basarios/Gravios attacks, wind-ups, and so on. At most, I was being dealt about 1/3 of my HP bar (can't remember which attack, exactly), when out of nowhere, I was one-shot. I chalked it up to not healing, went back, and after fifteen minutes, was carted again, from full HP, by some hyper version of his fire laser. Just before this, he was limping away, so I figured I could chase him down, finish him off. If he wasn't limping, I would have ended via subquest there and then. Fast-forward to his rest area, my Palicoes and I are wailing into him. I'm expecting him to drop any minute, when I'm clipped by his giga laser and OHKO'd again, failing the quest.

Similarly, Tigrex seemed to use his rock shot and super roar a lot more often, and Gore Magala combo'd me from full HP to a sliver, and both were a hell of a lot more evasive whenever the Frenzy Blight was inflicted upon me.

I took out Crimson Fatalis last night (the armour looks awesome, holy shit) and decided to attempt Pina when I woke up. Fast forward to now, and she's succeeded in triple carting me *again*. I've tried my Gunner sets, charge blade, even switch axe. I last 30-40 minutes, she's somehow not even limping, and I cart to her tailflip or a fireball. She seems to love nudging me into being stunned, then lining up her most powerful move, or waiting until I need to sharpen, or heal, or otherwise take myself out of the action for a hundredth of a second. I've got Healing Forte (had Attack for the previous 5-6 attempts), enough healing items to stock a small shop... I don't know what more I can bring. I get Guild Hall is harder, but Rathian's Wrath (GH, 5* Urgent) seems like it's forced multi just because of her sniping bullshit. Any tips or help would be appreciated.

EDIT: I actually beat her without meaning to. I gemmed in Evade +2, switched over to Arachnoscale (CB), and went in to try and learn her moves, and any tells she has. I still don't know if there's any warning for her backflip, but for the diagonal one, I noticed the step and dodged accordingly nine times out of ten. She also seems to lose all chill when in rage mode, which isn't very nice. :1

After spending a good four hours trying to paint digitally (and surfing the net for what digital painting actually IS), I'm going to pitch it to you guys.

The way I've always seen, you have three basic levels of colouring.
- Flats are just flat colours, cel shading optional.
- Shaded is more akin to soft-shading.
- Painted is lineless and the 'outlining' is just a darker shade.
Problem being, having no lines to go off of is really throwing me off. I'm planning on learning the third style as a special commission type, but... does it have to be lineless?

Four-ish hours later, I had a basic sketch down of her and a sword, then set to drawing my own character... and it all went downhill from there. A full hour yielded nothing but constant erasing and re-sketching and eventually giving up.

So besides any way to get past art block (that isn't just 'draw past it', it doesn't work for me), anyone know of any sites, books, what have you, that can teach me decent anatomy and posing? Life drawing classes are out of the question, and drawing from life in whatever public area you can think of just weirds me out.
