189,"If I was in charge I would offer an option to all native people on reserves. It would be a one time buy out. The government of canada will pay a one time, lump sum to opt-out of the treaty forever. 

Each native would be able to choose if they wanted the lump sum option, or they can reject it and keep on doing what they are doing.

This lump sum would be massive. It would be enough to move to good location, buy a house, and pay for schooling so you could get a good job/start a business. 

I think this would set the people up for real success and help to put an end to the problems they have. It would also take the power out of corrupt cheifs and put it in the hands of the native people.

Lastly, in the long run this method could save the Canadian government money. They spend billions every year on natives and it doesn't do much.",2016-04-11 14:30:35+00:00,d1ygor3,1,t3_4e7uxa,58863,canada
