Most of the guys a train with are good and I never have an issue, but theres always someone.

Sometimes I will roll with someone and they want to take my head off. I now have to avoid that person if I care about not getting hurt. Other times I'll get someone saying rude things and generally trying to be a bully.

Now I don't like the new instructor. He seems to be a jerk/very authoritative. I was waiting for class to start and I was talking to friend. The instructor told me to be quiet. Next class I see other people being louder than me before class, but nothing gets said to them. I feel like they are cooler and have more social currency than I do, so I'll always be the one having to deal with dominance issues.

I try to just remain quiet the whole class. That way I give people less chance to mess with me.

Is it normal to always be having problematic interactions in life and I'm just being to sensitive? ",bjj,How do I overcome personal problems,https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/4v27pu/how_do_i_overcome_personal_problems/

I try to keep scooting, so that he is in front of me, but I feel like it takes more physical effort on my part than his to keep the movement sustained.

The attacker will try to grab at my feet and pull. When he does I try to get his sleeves and connect but he just darts back out and the circle game continues.

What is the best strategy to deal with this?",bjj,Dealing with someone who circles your guard,https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/4pgy1k/dealing_with_someone_who_circles_your_guard/
