4,"I would say Kirk at the Browns, although I don't think Big Ben's performance is something to worry about after the eagles game. But like you said Cousins is against arguably the worse team in the NFL",2016-09-28 02:44:14+00:00,d850g9p,1,t3_54qpj6,45620,NFLFantasy

16,Then probably agility. I think he hits a little harder then strength especially since you already have a strong STR with Broly,2016-05-11 16:38:35+00:00,d31hctg,3,t1_d319pbi,10452,DBZDokkanBattle

22,"What was my perfect crime? I broke into Tiffany's at midnight. Did I go for the vault? No, I went for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman caught me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. The next morning, the cops came  and I escaped in one of their uniforms. I told her to meet me in Mexico, but I went to Canada. I didn't  trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I had a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I told Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I didn't show up. I went to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.",2016-04-11 04:00:51+00:00,d1y33h4,1,t3_4e6pt0,37245,AskReddit
