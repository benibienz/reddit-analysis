2,"Michael Black. Here is some info I have copy and pasted from various sources:  
  
The Supreme Court has heard a Mount Gambier prison inmate will detail a conversation in which Pfennig explained why he has never revealed the location of Michael Black’s body.

Pfennig is serving a life sentence for abducting and murdering Michael, 10, on the banks of the River Murray in January 1989.  
  
Michael disappeared while fishing and accompanied by his dog — prosecutors alleged Pfennig had taken him in a white van.

They further accused him of leaving the boy’s dog, fishing rod, clothing and bike near the river to give the impression Michael had drowned accidentally.

Michael’s body has never been recovered.

During his trial for Michael’s murder, the judge took the unusual step of allowing the jury to be told Pfennig had a “propensity” or tendency to abduct young boys.  
  
Pfennig was jailed for life with a 38-year non-parole period in 1992 for the murder of 10-year-old Murray Bridge schoolboy Michael Black.

Michael was abducted on January 18, 1989, from a reserve near Murray Bridge. Pfennig placed the boy's belongings upstream to give the impression he had drowned while swimming, but his body was never found.

Pfennig has also admitted abducting and sexually assaulting another boy, 13, in late 1989.",2016-11-12 11:42:59+00:00,d9x2rwc,2.0,t1_d9x1bxr,5644.0,UnresolvedMysteries

It wasn't THAT bad. They numb your back up which actually hurt the most. And the betadine or whatever they put on was cold. Then like 3 or 4 med students held down my legs while the put the needle in - there was no pain but because it passes through a ganglion of nerves my legs involuntarily would spasm so they had to hold them down and because I was too tired and weak to hold my own legs for as long as it took. The first few attempts had too much blood but they finally got one that they hoped would be okay.  
   
The whole time I was on my side and actually scared I was going to fart as I was curled up in a tight ball on a flat bed, really nauseated etc hahaha.   
  
Also they make you lay still for a few hours so you don't get a really bad headache. I had suspected meningitis and had a really shitty horrible headache anyway so I don't know if the lumbar puncture gave me one. 
 
They put a big dressing on my back that leaked fluid a little bit and there was a little bit of an ache but otherwise it was fine!   
  
  
Also I remember a med student was numbing my back and I'm on my side and can't see what's happening and I hear her ask the doctor ""where do I put the needle?""  
I was like fuckkkkk. But I'm fairly sure an actual doctor did it and just heaps of med students watched/held my legs - was around 5 or 6 in the room. ",2016-02-02 19:22:40+00:00,czlbbv9,1.0,t3_43tsbp,29308.0,melbourne

But the desperation of Larries and how aggressive they can be and definitely tin foil hate is embarrassing and borderline abusive.   
  
Also why would Liam and Zayn deny it? I am going to believe members of the band, their family, and Louis saying he is straight rather than deranged fans who are like ""ON THE 29TH AT 4AM LOUIS TWEETED..... THE NEXT DAY HARRY SAID HE WAS TIRED... WERE THEY UP ALL NIGHT FUCKING EACH OTHER IN THE ASS?""  
  
  
And just to clarify for any Larries: not believing doesn't make you a homophobe. It makes you someone who doesn't make assumptions about people and doesn't project their own fantasies onto people. If they came out as gay holy shit it would be amazing imagine the impact they could have on LGBTI youth. If they're straight... Respect that?

The Snowtown Murders by Jeremy Pudney. Was one of the main journalists involved with the case. Really good book. Explains the crimes without going overboard - they're heinous enough without all the extra fluff.  
  
Lambs to the Slaughter - a book about Derek Ernest Percy. Convinced of absolutely slaughtering a little girl called Yvonne Tuhoy and defecating on her body, suspected in the murders of many others including the Beaumont Children. Good book.  
   
An American one I liked was ""Pretty Little Killers"" by Daleen Berry. Goes into the murder of Skylar Neese by her two best friends and how they eventually got caught.   
  
Currently I'm reading a book about Daniel Morcombe (famous case here, his body wasn't found until like 10 years later and the undercover sting the police mounted to catch him was insane) however the book is focusing less on the crime (they don't know much of what happened) and more on the family during the time Daniel was missing.

I'm from Adelaide but lived in Melbourne for 5 months. Once waiting for a tram, a bogan guy with his 2 kids and another older guy started abusing one of the kids verbally and physically. Everyone just stood there watching so I, a 19 year old girl, intervened and told him to stop hitting his kid. Then the tram came and they got on.  
    
For some reason I searched for a local police station number because I was too scared of calling 000 in case I got in trouble because they had gotten on the tram.  
   
Then the lady from the police station said I should have called 000 but she was getting a police car to intervene the tram anyway.

550,"On snack exchange I got sent a few - I actually really just liked the instant vanilla one! The reason I love the Jell-O Puddings is because we don't get any product like that here in Australia except for instant mousse (you know what chocolate mousse is right?)  
  
But I am trying to add some to my wishlist and it keeps coming up with Prime Pantry? And has no option to add to my wishlist? Argh! ",2015-07-15 14:04:35+00:00,ct44wty,2.0,t1_ct44sw4,205.0,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon

552,"Ooooh New York! Oooh snow! I'm from Adelaide (South Australia). It doesn't snow here except very rarely. Like the other day it snowed up in the hills for like an hour. And all the news crews went there and filmed it etc. because it really isn't ""supposed"" to snow here!  
  
Ahh yep Hobart - down in Tasmania!
