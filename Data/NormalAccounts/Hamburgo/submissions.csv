Hopefully this post is allowed, thought it would be interesting to see the variation in our OCD.  
  
For me I must do everything 5 times.  
Annoyingly 6 is my most feared number so this can be pretty annoying if I accidentally go over 5, for example if I have to knock on wood 5 times and accidentally do 6. Then I have to repeat it and the more flustered I get the most likely I make mistakes.     
  
Also the number or anything can't contain 6 and can't add up to 6. For example volume on my laptop can't be 24, because 4+2 is 6. 


Basically everything I do by 5's. That's not all my OCD is but just the numbers aspect!  
  
So, what is ""your number"" and do you have any feared numbers?

I'll share that at the end. Most of this I typed myself based off the Charley Project page and some I copy and pasted. View it on Charley Project [here](http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/t/turney_alissa.html)
  
Alissa was 17 when she vanished from her home on May 17, 2001. It was her last day of school and her stepfather (Michael) took her out school early to go to lunch with him. While at lunch, he alleges that they had an argument because she said she wanted more priveleges. 
   
When they returned home, she went to her room angrily and he allegedly went off to do errands and pick up her sister. While doing the errands, he called Alissa and she did not pick up.   
  
When be returned home, she had apparently run away leaving a note saying she was leaving for California. Then, according to Michael, he received a call from her a week later from a pay phone: this was the last trace of her.  
   
Initially she was treated as a runaway however now authorities suspect foul play. At home she left all her belongings (hair brush, make up, house keys, cell phone, $1800 in cash), except a black back pack. According to Charley Project, it is uncharacteristic of runaways to leave all their belongings and money and never contact close friends or family again. 
  
All of Alissa's very close friends and boyfriend state she had never mentioned running away before.   
  
Alissa was described as a normal spirited teenager with a bit of a rebellious streak - occasional marijuana smoking and skipping class however she was a good student with a stable home life.  
  
Her step father Michael was very strict who went through her belongings, monitored phone conversations and would sit outside the restaurant she works. He has video surveillance set up in the home and all incoming and outgoing phone calls recorded however he never gave police the video tape of where Alissa went missing and said he reviewed all 8 hours and ""found nothing of interest"".  
  
He also claims his phone system wasn't operating the day Alissa called him.  
  
Several people came forward and stated that Alissa had said her stepfather sexually abused her, however he denied it and said he was a good parent and used the recordings for security reasons.  
  
In December 2008, police executed a search warrant on the home where Alissa had lived and the home across the street where her family lives now, looking for evidence in Alissa's case. They found nineteen high-caliber assault rifles, two handmade silencers, and 26 handmade explosive devices. It was the largest stockpile of weapons discovered in Phoenix Police Department history. More than 100 neighbors were temporarily evacuated from their homes as a safety precaution, and Michael was arrested on several weapons charges. He was carrying two pistols, a recording device and seven magazines of ammunition when he was arrested. Police found a 98-page document, titled ""Diary of a Madman Martyr"" in his home. In the document, Michael accused the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers of being behind Alissa's abduction and murder. He wrote that he had already killed two ""assassins"" who were responsible for his stepdaughter's death and he would blow up the union hall in revenge and kill himself in the process.  
    
  
In March 2010, Michael pleaded guilty to possessing 26 unregistered pipe bombs. He was sentenced to the maximum term of ten years in federal prison in September 2010. The sentencing judge cited reports that Michael suffers from a parnoid personality disorder that is worsening in spite of the psychiatric treatment he's received; she stated she felt he was dangerous to the public. He will be required to participate in a mental health treatment program in prison. Investigators haven't said whether Michael is a suspect in his stepdaughter's disappearance. They found many videotapes of Alissa at her home during the search, but not the one from the day she disappeared. His family set up a website advocating for him and proclaiming his innocence.  
  


Alissa lived with her stepfather, and younger half-sister at the time of her disappearance; her mother died of cancer when she was eight years old and Michael legally adopted her. Her four older half-brothers had moved out of the family home. She had no known enemies, and it's uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning. Many agencies continue to classify her as a runaway.
  
   
**MY THEORY**. 
I believe the stepfather had some involvement.  
  
1. He pulled her out of school early that day.   

2. He was the last to see her.   

3. Why did he randomly call her while out running errands? To me it seems as though he was doing it to try cover his ass.

4. The phone coincidentally wasn't working the one time she *allegedly* called from California. There is no proof she ever made it there or called from there. The one thing that stumps me is her hand written note, but who knows if that was done under duress or not.    

5. Everything is the stepfathers account - no one can verify his claims or be an alibi. He states she was angry, he states she called him. No proof available, his word against nothing.
  
6. She left all her belongings including cell phone, $1800 in cash not touched in a bank account, make up etc.  
   
7. Never had she told her closest friends, siblings or boyfriends that she had any plans to run away.  
  
8. Her stepfather was a former law enforcement officer. He would quite possibly know exactly how to clean up evidence and stage the perfect murder. Also the other LE officers may ""protect"" him.  
  
9. He refused to let police see his surveillance of that day, saying it wasn't interesting. Later when they seized the videos, that tape from that day was missing. 
  
10. Sexual abuse allegations - if he could do that, what else was he capable of?  
  
11. The search of his house where more than 100 nearby residents had to be evacuated due to the sheer amount of dangerous weapons and explosives.  
  
12. His previous verbal threats and statements that he has killed people.     
 
  
13. Diagnosed personality disorder where a psychiatrist said he was dangerous to the public.  
  
14. His family set up a page immediately proclaiming his innocence. Seems suspicious.  
  
  
Eh that's just my theory on it all! Just analysing some things I thought were indicative of something more sinister.

Weeks after taking Louise, her abductor phoned Kathleen Smith - who lived near the Bells - and asked about medical advice for Louise.

He told her where to find Louise's earrings - under a brick at the Beach Rd-South Rd intersection. Earrings matching Louise's were discovered.

Five weeks later he left Louise's pyjama top - neatly folded - on Mrs Smith's front lawn.

Algae and soil samples found on the pyjama top led police to the estuary area at Noarlunga but no trace of the girl was found.

Pedophile Raymond John Geesing was convicted of the crime, despite no body being found, but later was acquitted on appeal. 
  
However, following an advanced form of DNA testing done in the Netherlands (low-copy DNA testing) and a confession made in jail, Dieter Pfennig will face a judge-only trial this week after his DNA was found on her shirt. Dieter was imprisoned for the abduction and murder of Michael Black in January 1989 and the molestation of another boy later that year. 
  
He was a suspect for more than 2 decades and lived only 10 minutes from the home with his wife and 2 daughters.  
    
 
If this case is solved, it will close one of South Australia's longest and most famous cold cases.

Intro aside: my mandibular wisdom teeth are impacted. No big deal I'm getting them out soon.
