I'll try to post your released episodes each week, but feel free to do so yourself in case I don't get around to it. 

I've also added you to our [list of podcasts](http://hearthstonecalendar.com/podcasts/list). Let me know if you have any corrections.",2015-09-08 15:49:28+00:00,cuuiaid,1,t3_3k3dse,7255,hearthstone
1,"Wow, elitist. 

I have a full time job and family to look after. I also run the side that powers the upcoming events in your sidebar.

The stats are increasing by the minute.

Forget it.

2,"Ok, this is getting rediculous. I submitted this without a guide at https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/3jmgtj/mage_deck_mhysa_mother_of_dragons/, was told to add a guide, and now it's being deleted again. 

Please reconsider deleting this. It's a thoughtful discussion of the potential for dragon mage.",2015-09-04 16:58:51+00:00,cuqlvhf,2,t1_cuqlr6q,173,CompetitiveHS
3,"Very low at the moment. rank 15. That said, I've been stuck at rank 19 this season so this deck has dropped me 4 ranks un-optimized in the past few hours. Now that it's been tweaked it'll be even more reliable.

Highest I've ever gotten is rank 1 and 3 stars. X_X",2015-09-04 16:57:21+00:00,cuqlt88,4,t1_cuqlokm,189,HearthDecklists
4,"Yeah, agreed. I've pulled Acolyte of Pain for Ice Barrier and Volcanic Drake for Antique Healbot. Seems to be working a bit better now.",2015-09-04 16:48:11+00:00,cuqlfou,4,t1_cuqkp8k,1079,CompetitiveHS
5,"1. Twilight Drake gives me a strong mid game, whereas Nefarian would  add too much late game IMHO.

2. You almost ALWAYS get your dragon synergies in mid game, so I'm not worried about that. The mix of win conditions is to provide options and consistency. I was losing a lot to rush/aggro/face, but have since put in an ice barrier and antique healbot that seem to be helping quite a bit.",2015-09-04 16:47:28+00:00,cuqlent,2,t1_cuql39w,463,HearthDecklists

7,"You're right about Twilight Drake, which I've removed in favor of Ice Barrior for a little more survivability against aggro so I have time to stabilize.

I had the acolyte in there for the card draw, but I'm not finding myself low on cards with this deck (high curve), so it could probably go for sure. I think I'll pull him in favor of Mirror Entity as you suggest.

I thought of using Ysera, but being able to heal up or bring someone down is just too good in my book. I've already put Alex to good use.

Edit: I may use Healbot in place of Acolyte. There are times where even having Ice Barrier up doesn't buy me enough time.",2015-09-04 16:18:48+00:00,cuqk8i2,2,t1_cuqjz9g,377,hearthstone
8,"You're 100% right that both of those situations would suck, but everything sucks in the face of polymorph or hex, and running Hungry dragon just to combat one mage secret seems a little extreme. 

Sure, it always sucks to have a 3 mana spell like Effigy fizzle out and summon a 1 or two mana minion, but don't forget that you probably didn't pay for Effigy in the first place. That's why I'm running two mad scientists. ;-)",2015-09-04 15:42:57+00:00,cuqisbl,6,t1_cuqi5la,938,hearthstone
9,"Volcanic Drake is definitely turning out to be a ""faux ami"" (false friend). I have yet to play it in the last 8 games. Will sub for one ice block.",2015-09-04 15:21:13+00:00,cuqhwt5,4,t1_cuqhonn,338,hearthstone
10,"You're right, it's a bit transparent, but even if it's obvious, your opponent still has to kill your minions. To me, Effigy is the hardest secret for people to play around, especially when you're playing value dragons at tempo and no tiny minions for them to kill instead.",2015-09-04 15:20:20+00:00,cuqhvi0,4,t1_cuqhb8v,852,hearthstone
11,"Yeah, I completely agree with this. You mulligan for Mad Scientist, throw away Effigy, and then down the road you're drawing nothing but value dragons while having Effigy up for free.",2015-09-04 15:19:19+00:00,cuqhu16,5,t1_cuqhqvz,130,hearthstone
12,"Thanks. Will repost when I have more of a guide. I had posted a link to stats, but admittedly there isn't much there yet. Regardless, I'm getting good feedback elsewhere, and will repost with more discussion down the road. 

Thanks for taking the time to explain everything! :-)",2015-09-04 15:17:29+00:00,cuqhrd1,4,t1_cuqhc8t,640,CompetitiveHS

15,"You're right, but Mad Scientist provides me with a great 2 drop that has to be dealt with somehow. If it gets silenced, then that's one less silence to worry about. If not, then I get my Effigy up by around turn 3 or 4, at which point I'm getting at least equal value (3 mana).

I'm not crazy about mirror entity since people play around it fairly well, and with Effigy I have more control over the mana value of what's summoned.

I'll have to see if Defender of Argus would be a good fit based on the number of minions I have on the board on average.

Those subs sound about right. I'd go Ysera personally.",2015-09-04 15:02:42+00:00,cuqh6fj,2,t1_cuqgqd4,699,hearthstone
16,"The Twilight Guardians have so far provided me with plenty of survivability so far. If you get really low to face hunter, just Alexstraza back up to 15 on turn 9 (or earlier if you manage to get Thaurisan out). The trick is to kill any beasts so you don't get Kill Commandded to the face. I'm toying with the idea of Healbot. Will keep you posted.

Edit: I'm thinking of pulling the Volcanic Drake in favor of one Ice Block.",2015-09-04 14:57:18+00:00,cuqgyxl,2,t1_cuqgmza,527,hearthstone
