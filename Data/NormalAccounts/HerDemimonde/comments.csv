179,"The short answer: Yes, this was all I was asking, at least for now.  

Longer answer: As I've been improving my ukulele skills, I'm starting to see my limitations in music theory, and I'm trying to learn more about how to play.  Reading these how-tos has been important.  

(For the record, there was a C#m in the original key, and that threw me off.  When I transposed it from E, which was out of my vocal range, to C, I ended up with the C-Am-F-G turnaround.  And now I feel dumb.)  ",2015-11-15 16:17:07+00:00,cx0zxyl,2.0,t1_cx0zows,542.0,ukulele
