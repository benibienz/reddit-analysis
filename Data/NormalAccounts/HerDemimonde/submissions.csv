I had initially set up a pitch in front of Crema, but as soon as I tuned up, some try-hard in striped socks and frosted eyeshadow ousted me from my spot, complaining that they saw it first. Instead of playing into their childish games, I moved across the street in front of the Brattle Theater and began playing. This was fitting, since I had learned a set of Muppet songs in honor of their Muppet Madness series. 

The crowd across the street--such as it was--was smaller but more receptive. I got a lot of smiles and friendly gestures (including a few kids who sang along with me), as well as some nice compliments to go with my tips. Someone mentioned that Brattle Street was more populated at night, and that I would do better to go back then. 

Today was a windy one in Boston, and the wind kept blowing away my sheet music (hey, a few of those songs are tough!).  After the third or fourth time my skirt blew up I decided to call it a day.

The producer liked the idea, but because he's full up with guest cohosts, he asked me to touch base with him in about a month.  

Since I have some time before we get back in touch, I've started researching the resurgence of the little four-stringed instrument.  I have a few of Jim Beloff's books on hold at the library, and I'm also going to revisit The Mighty Uke and Life on Four Strings.  (I cannot find a copy of Rock That Uke for love or money.)  While I'm poring over the early research, here are some questions that have been on my mind: 

- Why has the ukulele become more popular?  
- What draws people to the ukulele?  
- What does the music of the ukulele symbolize?  I think it's interesting that the uke has ascended to a more prominent place in culture/the media at the same time that EDM and other electronic-based music has gained in popularity.  

Right now I'm looking for other resources that look at why the ukulele has become popular now, and what the popularity of the ukulele means.  Apart from the obvious sites (U-Hunt, bazmaz's blog, Ukulele Underground, Ukulele Magazine), what should I be reading or following for greater insight?

This time I was able to play for a full 30 minutes, including the TMBG songs and a few hits I learned for the occasion.  Instead of playing by Out-Of-Town news, I set up a pitch between the Coop buildings.  

I didn't play for as attentive a crowd as I did on Monday.  This was good (no Lev), but also kind of sad.  No one was going out of their way to engage, and I didn't want to be pushy and get in people's faces.  

I wore a thinner coat and played my more resonant tenor, but I still don't have an amp.  I'm out of work right now and can't justify the $125 cost of an amp, especially since I just signed up for a continuing ed class for my line of work.  One high school-aged dude yelled ""SING LOUDER!"" when he and his buddies passed me, and I wanted to yell back ""I'M TRYING!"" 

I made a dollar today as well.  Sadly the dollar got blown away in a gust of wind.  A few panhandlers were downwind from me, and I hope they got it.  They could use it more than I could.

I set out at lunchtime and managed to get a great pitch, at the elevators between Out of Town News and the gigantic Starbucks ([near here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/HarvardStationEntrance.agr.JPG), if you're in Boston).  

I wish I could say it was a success in some form.  I've been practicing a set of They Might Be Giants songs, and when I set up my pitch and started playing ""Why Does the Sun Shine?"" a few people with small children wandered by and stood in front of me.  This was cool--even if they didn't throw money into my case, I was still excited to see kids enjoying what I was doing!  

Midway through my second song, a guy came up to me and said ""I LIKE YOUR HAT.""  I nodded at him and started playing again.  He continued ""MY NAME IS LEV AND I LIKE PEOPLE"", and I nodded again and kept playing.  He stood DIRECTLY in front of me, so close that I could smell his breath, and KEPT TALKING, and I finally had to say ""Please leave me alone.""  He found this upsetting and wandered away.  

I restarted my song, but had gotten thrown off and was struggling with it.  I was also not working with the best equipment.  The action on my main ukulele has lowered, and I took my soprano beater...which was much plinkier than I remember it.  (I haven't been able to afford an amp and was playing acoustic.)  In addition, the cuff on my coat kept muting the strings, which further threw me off.  

I stopped playing after four songs.  I made $1, which I passed on to a panhandler I passed on my way to get a sandwich.  I'm not upset at the lack of money I made (though I WOULD like to make back the cost of my busking license at some point)...what I found disappointing was how badly it went.  I know there are some things I can fix (wear a different coat, restring my tenor, and get an amp), but I was hoping I'd run into some nifty people while I was busking and play through all my songs.  I've been lonely after I got laid off from my job, and my failure at busking made me feel like I'm not even good at something I enjoy doing.
