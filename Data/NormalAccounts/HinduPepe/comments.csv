20,"&gt;Not even addressing my other arguments

Cause they have nothing to do with the discussion.

&gt;Clearly wrong in that Qui Gon was a shitty boring character?

I've rewatched it and Qui Gon is a great heart warming character. None of the Force Awakens characters are as engaging. Just annoying 

&gt;Clearly wrong in that the midichlorians were pointless and added nothing to the fucking plot?

What did the random Irish Space pirated add in Farce Snoozes? Nothing. Mediclorians were a non-issue blown out of proportion by morons. It simply expands the Force Mythology and they were written about in the novels long before Phantom Menace.

&gt;Clearly wrong that the movie was full of boring scenes where characters talk about trade and fucking politics?

Those scenes weren't boring and I challenge you to rewatch it. Phantom is more engaging and artistically mind blowing than 99% of the crap pooped out of Hollywood. The entirety of Farce Snoozes was more boring than the Politics in that movie. And Rogue Mary-Sue One looks even worse.

&gt;Clearly wrong that the movie had generally boring characters too?

I didn't think they were boring. But I found Finn's horrendous american accent grading on the ears. and Rey was wooden. If you type in wooden acting into google image search a bunch of pictures of Daisy Ridley appear...
