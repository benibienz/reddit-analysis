The song I'm listening to sounds cheesy, everything I think seems stupid and childish, my friends seem like they're bad actors in a middle school play, etc. 

I don't usually feel like this when I'm sober, but for some reason weed just makes everything feel this way. Does anybody else experience this? Is it the weed having an effect on me, or am I just a negative person?

After some research, here's what I decided to get:

Micca MB42x Speakers http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E7H8GG2//ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=noaudiophilec-20

Lepai Amp http://www.amazon.com/Lepai-LP-2020A-Tripath-Class-T-Amplifier/dp/B0049P6OTI/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439048793&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lepai

My question is, will I need to purchase anything else in order to get this setup to work with a desktop or a laptop computer? Any necessary cables, other devices I need to purchase? I tried looking but there's so many different products and wires and I'm not very knowledgeable in this kind of hardware. Thank you, any help is appreciated.
