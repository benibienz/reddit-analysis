35,"Hello,

I'm entirely new to this sub. In fact, I am entirely new in supporting Hillary. I switched my party affiliation this year to vote Trump in the primaries. Soon after, I started regretting that decision. While I understand the concerns, fear, and worry embedded in his supporters, I also think they're voting with more emotion than with the common sense that I know deep down they have. I watched both conventions, I read/watch news from all outlets, and I am fairly open-minded to just about every idea/side of things. So, I watched Hillary last night (among a few other speakers throughout the week). I didn't expect much of it other than to be shamed in one form or another. This is my bad, for misjudging what her platform actually stands for. I found myself in tears through both her and Chelsea's speeches. I felt liberated. She addressed me and my concerns, as well as just about everyone else's. I respect that so much. I felt a sense of calm in a time of chaos--something I look for to be provided by my next president. I guess the point of this is to say, I support Hillary. I will be looking into her policies again (I have already previously but not as thoroughly as I should've), and reading more on her story and accomplishments. After feeling disappointed last week with Trump and the RNC, I was picked up, dusted off, and reassured that everything is going to be okay by Hillary. I needed this.

And I mean food and drinks left and spilled everywhere. Broken glass. The mattress was taken off the bed and left on the other end of the room. Stains on all of the sheets and bedding. Shit was insane. It took 3 housekeepers to clean, and the room to be left out-of-order for 2 days because it was just unsellable. Can confirm that at least this film crew we dealt with were DICKS.

EDIT: It was up to the property to let them use the room for free, &amp; with no card on file. I was not a part of the management team, so I had no say in the matter. Also, there was no single ""company"" kind of card on file. They were all individual cards tied to their individual rooms, and we had no clue which of the crew were to blame for the mayhem.

173,"Also, this past weekend was my first weekend hiking. I used to go to the gym months and month ago, but I hated it. Too restricting an environment and I hated that I couldn't wait to leave. So, when I found this park nearby, I was ecstatic. I'm saving for a bike, too, so that I can ride it in the park as there are several very long trails for both hiking and biking! With that said, the park is open at only the exact hours I work, so I am hoping the hours are extended when the clocks change and it stays lighter later. As of now, I can only make it Saturday and Sunday, and each day I hike about 6-7 miles or more.

174,"Answers:

1. Have you noticed any negative side-effects while consuming 1200 calories/day (light headedness, fatigue, etc.)?
No. If anything, I feel ions better. It's been a while, and with this change and cutting an hour out of my sleep, I get less headaches/migraines, feel way less fatigued, and function much better on a daily basis in general.
2. How sustainable do you find this plan?
It's generally easy for me stick to it. I noted before, at times it's been hard even reaching 1,200 calories now that I am counting. I've only started eating breakfast daily in January, to add more calories and to provide myself with the necessary energy I need to start my day. Before, I would eat lunch only, and a dinner that was sometimes too heavy. And my lunches used to consist a lot of processed junk as it was cheaper. Now, I prep my lunches, this week -- a half of bell pepper stuffed with ground turkey, reduced fat feta, salt-free corn and diced tomatoes, and quinoa. I cook fresh dinners for myself nearly every night, almost always a chicken breast with a side of veggies. If I eat breads/pastas, they're whole wheat or for the pasta, veggie pasta only. Organic sauces, or I make my own with fresh ingredients--this goes for any kinds of dressings I have too. I'm teaching myself a way of life, basically. How to cook with fresh and healthy ingredients all while making delicious meals out of them. The only time I struggle is when I get a serious craving, which does not happen often--maybe once or twice a month. When that happens, I either go get myself a small portion of what it is I want by saving it for my cheat meal so that I can look forward to it, as you mentioned. Which brings me to 
3. Would you rather eat slightly more calories per day without cheat days, or continue what you are doing so that you can have slightly larger meals once or twice per week?
I would rather look forward to a cheat, it keeps me motivated to stay on track so that I can reward myself later in the week.

245,"Last summer, I was working front desk at a hotel. An irate guest, a woman who was black (I being white), made an error with her online reservation that she booked herself. We were a sold-out property, and the only thing I could do to accommodate her was offer a room switch the next day. She then went on to change the subject and focus only on my ""white privilege"". She spat at me, said things like, ""you work for ME now"", and ""you're nothing but a white privileged bitch who deserves nothing"". This went on for twenty minutes before I told her I would have her escorted off the property by police. She then went on a rampage about the police, completely tarnishing them with even worse words, and said that ""I served this country and I'm a black woman who will get anything I want."" 

Whether or not she was delusional, I will never know, as management kicked her out the following morning (I was alone on that previous night shift). But I do have every reason to believe SHE was/is racist. 

I will never understand how some say racism only goes one way...",2016-02-11 20:59:41+00:00,czwgryg,1.0,t3_45a0rr,11619,news
