My boyfriend and I have been together for three years. Since we've been together, we've purchased two new cars, moved into a beautiful apartment, adopted two cats and two fish, and both have new, better paying jobs. Also, I will be starting school in a few days to get my Bachelor's, and work toward a real career of my own (he's already in the field he loves). We've come really far, and we're proud. 

Yesterday, we had a long talk about the future. We do this often, but mostly about marriage and trips we want to take together. These things make us super excited. We got on the subject of kids though, and to my surprise, we both agreed we'd rather live a life for each other and ourselves. We both suffer from anxiety and depression, and come from families who suffer, too. This is a huge concern for both of us, as we don't wish passing that on to anyone. 

More on my end: I also have issues with patience, and have never really liked being around kids. I'm good with them and all that, and people always tell me how great a parent I'd be (though there's absolutely no telling unless I have one in my opinion). But I don't believe I could handle one of my own. They generally annoy me, and I find myself freaking out anytime a friend asks me to hold or watch one. Most of my friends are pregnant or having their second or third kid by now, and I've been asked numerous times when we plan on having one. He has been asked this same question. When asked, the thought has never made me giddy or really even, happy. It's stressed me out though, to the point of me turning to a glass of wine lol. While we both agreed that if it happens, fine, we'll do our best, we also agreed that I will be starting birth control soon, as it's really not what we want as partners. We simply have too many goals and dreams of things we want to accomplish together, that do not in any way involve children. 

Some people have made remarks about our future plans, including our families. Pressure is obviously there. People think this automatically means something's not right in our relationship. I'm not sure when having kids became a requirement and not a choice, but we don't care. We're excited for my schooling, and his promotions, and our countless trips to Disney without screaming kids in strollers of our own. Basically, our life, our choice. We are thrilled about our child-free plans.

No real purpose of this other than to vent/talk about our plans, and my excitement about finding this community, as it's so rare to see!",childfree,"Our life, our choice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/4pbfia/our_life_our_choice/

I have been raised by my father, who spent the large sum of my life thus far, making sure I had zero communication with her. At 15, I saw her at my grandmother's funeral, and she was no different. Still doped up, even at the viewing. I didn't speak to her after that until I was about 21. We would talk on occasion over the phone, sometimes she would sound sober, others her words would be so slurred I couldn't understand her. We did this for about a year, and even though she had begged me to go visit her, I couldn't bring myself to. I knew she was no different than before. If anything, she's worse off--now living off of the system and still abusing prescription drugs. So, I distanced myself and eventually changed my number, without bothering to call her again. I don't want to get attached to her, as I feel like she's no better. But I still love her, she's my mother. Everyone in the family has tried talking her off of the ledge she's been on since I can remember, but she never does. She is selfish and refuses to change, even after she was forced to get several surgeries in relation to her addictions/issues.

In the beginning, I didn't let much of anything get to me. I came into it open-minded and pretty care-free. But as time's passed, and now that we're much more serious, one thing keeps haunting me: the fact that he's already been engaged, and that he lived with his ex, too.

I know he's moved on, and that now he's with me. But I can't help but wonder, can someone really want to marry more than one person? I don't know how someone could, as personally, I set high standards and don't just want to marry anyone under sun. That person's gotta be damn special. And to me, he's that one. I worry constantly that he won't mean it if he asks me, as he says he didn't with her. He swears he was pressured (she even picked her own ring and had it mailed to his name). But still. It scares me, maybe most of all because he's already done it all. Except actually go through with marriage. He is the first guy I have agreed to live with, and the first I've ever wanted to marry. But I'm not his first anything.

Funny thing is, none of this got to me until we started talking about the next steps ourselves. I want to stop dwelling on his past, and live in our now. But I'm struggling to understand where he's come from.
