93,"That's the lenght of my hair right now, though I'm trying to grow it out a little more. It really depends on what style you're going for? If you'd like to slick it back all the way, you should just let it grow, if you'd like it to go more over to the side, you could get it cut in the side, and have an undercut? 
I feel like an undercut with the hair swept over to the side, maybe a little back, would go well - It fits most people, and with dark hair like yours, the sides will still be very defined if you choose to cut them more than the longer hair on top.",2016-03-02 21:52:36+00:00,d0l92cz,1.0,t3_48nzqd,7047.0,malehairadvice

98,"I'm actually in the exact same situation right now, well almost at least. It seems your mother doesn't take the problem seriously, and she evidently needs a clear signal that you're not okay. I'd try by just saying you feel bad every day, generally just feel sad and that you really want to talk to someone professional. If that doesn't work, maybe just put it all out on the table, and tell her how bad it really as, if you're brave enough for that.
I'm actually planning to tell my older brother first, and probably within the next couple of days, I'm rather terrified to say the least.",2015-12-20 00:36:56+00:00,cy4zpe4,1.0,t3_3xezo2,83153.0,mentalillness
