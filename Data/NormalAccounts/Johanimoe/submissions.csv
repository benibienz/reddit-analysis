Not to talk about the amount of modded accounts he's got. He makes a new account, within one day he's lvl 200 and has over a billion dollars. Whenever someone actually points it out, he just bans them from his twitter or youtube?
How has he not been banned himself? The fact that he makes money off of this is completely incomprehensible. Does youtube not do anything about it?

On ps4 it seems as there are almost no players still doing them, and when I finally get around to invite 4 people to one of the setups, someone leaves instantly. I'm just looking for someone who'd be interested in doing the heists, since I've heard it's the only good way to make a lot of money and be able to buy the high end cars and such.

I think you could choose your class too, like warrior and i think there was a rogue too.
