semi-related: In Half-Life Opposing Force, there are several parts that overlap with the character Gordon Freeman you play from Half-Life.

Loved every second of it until they decided to pile on the minions and nerf the crap out of towers for the sake of game time. That's when it stopped being fun. Now its a game of who can manage minions better. I don't care what the current opinion is, but most games are decided after one major team fight, there is no come back if your losing, just a slow death. 

Please ^^don't ^^^hate ^^^^me

I doubt the new map will fix anything unless they make attacking towers an actual challenge, it's just too easy to take them out.

- Minion waves change on a dime
- Early game, if I push out my lane and I go home, I come back to my tower always taking damage

- Fighters don't draw aggro for hitting me under tower (this was there before, but now it stands out to me more)
