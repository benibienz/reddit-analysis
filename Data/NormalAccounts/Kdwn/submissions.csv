around $1300, cheaper the better, shipped to the US

* **Do you prefer low weight, a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick any that apply.** 

looking for less than 6 lb, but my last laptop was 8 lb so anything below that is fine. I don't need a long lasting battery because it'll be plugged in most of the time.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**

Windowz

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**
 
14.4 - 15.6

Smaller laptops don't tend to have the most efficient cooling so i'm leaning towards 15.6in

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 

Yes, all of it

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 

I'm not picky, I've always been used to turning down graphics for my games, but I want it to be somewhat future proof for at least 3 years. So at least a 970m and a skylake i7

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 

Cooling is my absolute biggest concern, also quality

Hello all, I've been using a 3-4 year old hand-me-down MSI gt60 (core i7-3630qm, nvdia 675m, 12gb ram)as my main laptop for the 2 years and the GPU is no longer functional (as in not being detected at all by windows or linux or anything).

Good excuse to upgrade I guess.

For the best bang for buck, I've been looking at the Sager NP8657 / Clevo P650RE3, do you guys think this is a good choice? I've never bought a sager/clevo laptop so I'm thinking of going with LPC digital based on reviews I've seen from them.

Are there any other comparable laptops?

I'm new to Facebook ads and I started my first campaign 4 days ago with an ad set for clicks to website targeting 4.3mil people, automatic bid and $10 daily budget. I checked and double checked the schedule, spending limit, and if the campaign, ad sets, and ads were active. After 2 days, nothing had come out of it, no reach, no results, no cost even though everything is active.
 
 
It's a lot easier than adwords to setup so I was confused if I missed anything. Did some searching on the facebook community forums and google, found out there's no real way to contact support and that a lot of other people have the same issues with no proper solution.
 
 
One person said that she had to make another account to get her ads going so I tried that. I remade the same campaign in the new account and sure enough within a few hours I was getting results. I was a happy camper. I then created another ad set and not only does this new ad set have no reach, no results and no cost, but my original one stopped the moment this new one was created. It's been 2 days.
 
 
What gives? I've doubled and triple checked, everything active, spending limit fine, automatic bid, currently scheduled to go till the end of next week. I've either messed them up or it's just plain buggy for me.

I was just wondering what is the recommended amount for a manual bid for news feed ads to a website, I'm not doing any right bar/instagram/partner ads (should I be?)


Facebook is giving me a suggested bid of .85 from a range of .35 - 1.30


Would I start at .35 and go up from there or can I get away with starting even lower?


Any thoughts on automatic bidding?

I got pulled over on the I-5 highway which has a speed limit of 60mph on 9/3. I was polite and courteous, but I got a ticket for doing 70. I wasn't asked to sign anything and there was also no radar used. There was also misprint of my address which I didn't notice until after I got home. I selected that I wanted to contest and put my correct address down and mailed it in.
Fast forward to 10/7 and I still haven't received anything in the mail so I decide to call the court office and ask about my case. The clerk said they sent it. I confirm with them that they sent it to the proper address.

I double check the mail, still nothing, I call the next day again to ask when the actual court time is because I still haven't received it. It was then that the clerk mentioned that I could pay to download the documents online. The court date is 10/30

Sure enough, I downloaded the notices and it was sent to the wrong address.
I did some research and in the state of Washington, I found the best way to fight the ticket is to file for a notice of discovery and hope they don't send it in time.
Fast forward to today and I decided I'd double check the case files to download and I notice on 10/13 they added a return to sender notice and on it says ""mailed to address updated from hearing request""

Tomorrow is the last day to send them a notice for discovery, do I skip that hoping that I can argue that they never sent the notice to proper address and so I couldn't use any of their options provided for me on time or do I file for discovery and hope that they don't send it on time, but letting them know that the mail never mattered?
