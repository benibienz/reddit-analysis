Chris Jericho: ""The second the 'AJ Styles' chants ended those were replaced by 'This is awesome, this is awesome' or 'holy shit, holy shit'. [laughs] Where's my fucking chant? Here's the thing, a lot of people still chant 'Y2J, Y2J; You still got it!'—all the shit. But the fact is, even if there's three or four people in that crowd that are booing me, pisses me off.  But you see, I'm Chris Jericho and I made this goddamn place. So who the fuck you think you are when you buy your tickets to come sit and boo me? Fuck you! The night Bryan left nobody cared that I was in the fucking ring, all they cared about was streamers, 'yes, yes', he's leaving, he's a big fucking hero, then he cuts a little fucking promo—oh my god, suddenly he has some cute little words he can spill out of his ugly fucking face, but he's leaving and everybody is sucking his dick."" ",2016-03-08 12:37:58+00:00,d0ryukm,2,t1_d0rymdw,680,SquaredCircle

They got this kid and they're pushin' him hard 
And people have been chantin' his name 
But tonight he's gonna learn what it's like to do the job 
When he's goin' one on one with The Game 
This guy can't draw with a paper and pen 
I'm the one they came to see 
Everybody in the back must be outta their minds 
If they think I'm goin' down for the THREEEEEEEE 

AM I FUCKING GOING OVER

I don't care if you got fans across the land 
I'll lay you down on the mat for everyone to see 
I got your destiny within my mighty hands 
You may be over but you ain't goin' over me 

Well if you wanna feud I'll let ya win once 
But I'm comin' out on top in the end 
And the only way you're winnin' on PPV 
Is if we happen to be best friends 
And if you beat me for the title it's only for a night 
Because I'll get it back the very next day 
Yeah I got the power and the championship 
Can't nobody take that awaaaaaaaaaaaaaay 

AM I FUCKING GOING OVER

I buried London and I buried Charlie Sheen 
I buried Hitler and his whole goddamn regime 
I buried JFK and I buried Lincoln too 
And if you think I'm goin' down then I am burying YOU
