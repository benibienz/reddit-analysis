Although I've seen people like seeing the alternate realities. Starlight Glimmer's backstory on why she became obsessed with Equality is really underwhelming and so is the ending, basically she held all that grudge just to give it away. I mean Season 1,2,3,4 villains were not redeemed except for Discord, but it took awhile.

Redeeming was abrupt. cause of Equality obsession is lackluster. If only they showed only 1 alternate reality where all of the villains got let loose which could've saved a lot of time for more content that added to the plot, it felt like a ""okay guys we need it to last 42 minutes, I'mma just add fillers and stuff to make it longer"". That remaining time could've been used to flesh out the backstory of Starlight Glimmer and his friend more, jesus, could've shown a love interest or a deep friendship, like he was starlight's only friend which scarred her and stuff and made the redeeming more sound. When I first heard the plot was time travelling to prevent /the/ sonic rainboom, I was so amazed. then when the episode started, I saw Josh Haber was the one writing it and I was like, this isn't going to be good cause Friendship Games was meh-ish imo. and I wasn't wrong. The song was good though. considering The Mane Attraction was such a great episode before this one, is a disappointment. I also like Starlight's Filly look. :D, man, I hope they start Season 6 with a bang to make up for this lackluster finale. Just my two cents.

158,"""My Prediction after seeing the SDCC portion Before this Episode was aired""

I thought this is how the story would've gone. Rara being the same color/western pony like AJ as she cried during the show. Rara was living the fancy popstar life that she was fixated in due to being famous, Rara then meets Applejack and seeing her life with her friends having fun and friendship, made her realize that her fancy life was all glitz and glam with no substance but just a bits-making, popularity thing that she was doing her entire life just because she had already signed up and already got famous so she didn't stop and just kept going like a normal life routine, she forgot what life/ true happiness was about and just continued said routine. She contemplates her entire life and realizes that she doesn't want to do this her entire life as she was really a country singer but country singers don't prosper in manehattan. Her manager then tells her that she's on for a big performance. She now goes on to the big stage, everyone is shocked(as they were expecting a pop performance) as she is not on her normal popstar attire and she then sings the song and everyone is shocked and ends up liking her. And she gets her cutie mark(dunno, I sort of assumed when the cutie mark shined, it was the day she got her cutie mark).

Don't get me wrong, I kinda liked the episode with the AJ and RaRa backstory, I just found it rather bland that it went like, ""I found out manager is abusing his power, i'm leaving you"". Applejack: ""you have to be urself(not exact quote)"". Rara is now back to her usual self.

The execution was lacking imo(I think it's mostly because its time limit is 21 minutes). I was expecting more for her to finally be able to shift back to her old self as she got used to the pop/fancy life. but then again it is shown that she was still herself in the fillies interaction portion

I kinda wanted her to change back to her old self from within, not influenced by applejack's words. :O

I still liked the episode just that I thought it could've been executed better.
