Rara being the same color/western pony like AJ as she cried during the show. Rara was living the fancy popstar life that she was fixated in due to being famous, Rara then meets Applejack and seeing her life with her friends having fun and friendship, made her realize that her fancy life was all glitz and glam with no substance but just a bits-making, popularity thing that she was doing her entire life just because she had already signed up and already got famous so she didn't stop and just kept going like a normal life routine, she forgot what life/ true happiness was about and just continued said routine. She contemplates her entire life and realizes that she doesn't want to do this her entire life as she was really a country singer but country singers don't prosper in Manehattan. Her manager then tells her that she's on for a big performance. She now goes on to the big stage, everyone is shocked(as they were expecting a pop performance) as she is not on her normal Popstar attire and she then sings the song and everyone is shocked and ends up liking her. And she gets her cutie mark(dunno, I sort of assumed when the cutie mark shined, it was the day she got her cutie mark).

Don't get me wrong, I really liked the episode with the AJ and RaRa backstory, I just found it rather bland that it went like, ""I found out manager is abusing his power, I'm leaving you"". Applejack: ""you have to be yourself(not exact quote)"". Rara is now back to her usual self.

The execution was lacking imo(I think it's mostly because its time limit is 21 minutes). I was expecting more for her to finally be able to shift back to her old self as she got used to the pop/fancy life. but then again it is shown that she was still herself in the fillies interaction portion.

I kinda wanted her to change back to her old self from within.

Nevertheless, This is one of my favorite episodes in S5. :3 Rara is Life.
