17,"Yeah it looks like you're gonna have to wait for it to grow back. You can go to another place to see if they can salvage it, but they'd have to cut it even shorter most likely. I'm not sure what you told the guy that cut your hair, but I wouldn't go back there. When I had short hair and got only a trim, my hairdresser would spend 30 minutes or more on my hair. Unless you told him just to give you a chop across the back, it sounds like he half-assed it. I'm not sure where you live, so do some research about hair salons around your area (not places like Great Clips or Sports Clips, those places will give you a shit cut regardless of it being the owner or someone who is cutting hair for the first time), read reviews, etc. Also, next time you get your hair cut, don't be afraid to bring a picture along with you or on your phone. Show it to the hairdresser, make sure to explain what you want and what you don't want. Good luck finding a new hair salon!

Using a hairdryer on medium heat will speed up the drying process and won't damage your hair as long as the heat isn't too high. Wide toothed combs are good when your hair is wet, like you said brushing is hard for you right now but it will hopefully become easier when your hair gets smoother.

66,"If your routine isn't working, I'd drop the homemade treatments and your conditioner. Go look at the store for moisturizing conditioners and shampoos, use the shampoo about once a week, conditioner every day or every other day depending on your hair type. I use conditioner every day and my hair is really soft and shiny, but that may not work for you. My favorite shampoo and conditioner line is the Organix line, I really recommend the renewing Moroccan Argan oil shampoo and conditioners (I'll link to the conditioner below). They have other types that you can use if those don't get the results you want, I recently changed my conditioner to their bamboo conditioner to thicken up my hair and I really love the results. I'd even recommend buying a boar bristle brush, they can make your hair smooth and shiny (make sure you buy one that says 100% boar bristle, or pure boar bristles. Some brands sell boar bristle brushes that have only like 1% of the brush being boar bristles)

tl;dr - drop the routine you have now, go to the store and look for some new shampoo and conditioner.  Buy a pure boar bristle brush while you're at it.

80,"I recently bought new conditioner and shampoo (OGX Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo, and the same for the conditioner), you might want to look into it and see how your hair feels about it.  For some people it handles frizz, for others not so much. I really like it, but try only shampooing your hair once a week, use only conditioner the rest of the week. Like others are saying, stop combing and brushing your hair as much as you are. Invest in a hair dryer and use it on low to medium heat if you don't have time to air dry your hair (the hair dryer will also cut down on poofiness that comes with air drying).",2015-12-20 22:59:32+00:00,cy5yd9z,1.0,t3_3xmc9p,6382.0,FierceFlow

I'd wait and grow you hair longer first, because the weight of your longer hair might get rid of the afro aspect of your hair.
