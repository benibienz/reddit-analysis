I feel like [Rocket League](http://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/) might be one of the most requested games on this subreddit right now. I'm jumping on that train now I guess, because Rocket League looks amazing. I get a chance to plug one of my favorite youtubers ever, STAR_, he's the one that I first saw Rocket League through. A while back when he was streaming Rocket League I watched [this entire 4 hour stream](http://www.twitch.tv/ster/v/8279187), plus some more on his other streams. 

**About Rocket League**

If you've never heard of Rocket League before, it's basically soccer but with rocket powered cars, hence the name. You can fly through the air, do flips, and be the Mechanical Lionel Messi that you never knew you wanted to be. Rocket League has been featured in many gifs on the front page of /r/gaming since it became more popular, showing some [awesome goals](http://gfycat.com/ShamelessFearfulCardinal) and [last second scores](http://gfycat.com/GaseousEducatedAmazondolphin). In my opinion, the reason why Rocket League is so popular is because of how simple it is. You don't get things that upgrade your car to give you an unfair advantage against other players, you can't pay for better gear, it's just a game based on skill. It's a nice break from games like Blacklight Retribution in which if you want to unlock any new items you most likely will have to pay real money to be able to afford it, and even then you're only renting the item for a short time period after which you'll have to pay for it again.


I normally play FPS games, so I'm actually really looking forward to playing this game some day, I've never really played a game like this before. I'd love to be involved with a community thats so dedicated to a game like that of which of /r/rocketleague. 

If you'd like to buy this game for me, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks for taking your time to read this. Have a nice day!

Firstly, I'd like to start out with a thanks. I just stumbled upon this sub and to be honest, I'm *amazed* by this community. I haven't gifted anyone a game yet, seeing as I'm too broke to buy even this game, but I hope one day when I do a few jobs and get some money in my pocket I can come back to this sub and do some of the stuff you guys do and make a complete stranger's day. So thanks to everyone on this sub for doing stuff for others.

I'm a highschool student, so I could just ask my parents. But, my parents do so much amazing stuff for me there's no way in hell I would ask them to buy me a game that I'd spend time on away from them. Gaming, for the most part, I like to try and buy on my own.

***About The Game***

In case you don't know, Battlefield is a first-person shooter, very similar to the Call of Duty series which I have recently been enjoying very much due to its fast paced action with close quarter combat. The thing that sets the Battlefield series apart from Call of Duty is the immense sizes of the maps, along with more customization, which is what I really love about Battlefield, it just feels a lot more *real*. Another thing I like about the Battlefield series is the fact that you can be so creative with how you play the game. If you haven't seen it already, I'd recommend watching the [Battlefield 3 TV trailer](https://youtu.be/Zo5-XpQ5Jkk?t=19s) by FreddieW. 

In Battlefield, you aren't confined in small, bland maps, you're part of a living environment that reacts to what you do to it. Need to get into a building? Throw some C4 on the wall and trigger it. Now you have a brand new door for you to run through. If you've ever played a Battlefield game in the past, you have to remember the feeling you got when you first blew up a building or shot a helicopter out of the sky. Battlefield 4 is full of awesome features that I absolutely *adore*, from an awesome destruction engine to drive-able vehicles to ginormous outdoor combat.

Another thing I'd like to add is [this gif.](http://i.imgur.com/RiCchoa.gifv) In case you don't know what's going on, the wall in front of the two players is hit by a sniper rifle round, completely exploding the wall. It's the little details that make the battlefield experience so awesome.

**So.**

 Here I am, on /r/GiftofGames, asking strangers to buy Battlefield 4 for me. It still seems kind of foreign to me, asking someone I've never met before for a gift. I took a big break from gaming for a few years, but recently I've been getting back into it. I've never played a Battlefield game on PC before, only old Battlefields on console, so I'm pretty excited to see how it feels!

If you feel like it, I would love to have Battlefield 4 as a gift, and you can be damn sure I'll be back on this sub when I get a job to do the same thing for someone else. The game is on Origin, so I'm not sure how gifting works with it. If you need any of my details, feel free to DM me.

Firstly, I'd like to start out with a thanks. I just stumbled upon this sub and to be honest, I'm *amazed* by this community. I haven't gifted anyone a game yet, seeing as I'm too broke to buy even this game, but I hope one day when I do a few jobs and get some money in my pocket I can come back to this sub and do some of the stuff you guys do and make a complete stranger's day. So thanks to everyone on this sub for doing stuff for others.

I'm a highschool student, so I could just ask my parents. But, my parents do so much amazing stuff for me there's no way in hell I would ask them to buy me a game that I'd spend time on away from them. Gaming, for the most part, I like to try and buy on my own.
