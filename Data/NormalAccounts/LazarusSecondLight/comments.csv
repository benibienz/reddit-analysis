21,"Just my twopenneth worth here... I think everyone finds their place, and yes, this is a wonderfully calm and friendly environment. I'll go out on a limb and suggest that we're all here for the same reason, we have wonderful stories to tell, and a voice with which to tell them. We're not trying to harvest karma, we just want to share. Because someone, somewhere, out there, is going to appreciate it. So if you're lurking out there, listening to other people, and wanted to get your feet wet, get yourself verified, and come and join in. The more voices, the merrier. Because you're you, and maybe that scriptfill, would be your opportunity to show your slant on it.

And a few comments have mentioned quality of recording. Hell, my early stuff, was mangled through Audacity, because I was leaning over my keyboard into the inbuilt mike. So I treated myself, and got a proper one. But. You dont have to do that, there are many many talented people here, so all you have to do is ask for help. I'll even offer myself up, since I know my way around Audacity. Just shoot me a PM, and I'll see what I can do. Or maybe we can do.

But the point is. GWA is a wonderful place. The first way to enjoy it, is to listen, and feast. But the best way to enjoy it, is to take the first step and contribute. We all want to hear what you have to say, dont forget that :)",2016-09-21 18:22:37+00:00,d7wcizf,1.0,t3_53qqaq,61943.0,GWABackstage

I too, have always wondered what I would do, if someone discovered the secret life I lead. I express myself to scratch an itch that needs to be scratched, I dont do it to earn karma. I never expect any upvotes, I simply put them out there, and sometimes get very kind comments of appreciation, so I smile and giggle at the thought that someone out there has blushed and sighed because of something that I decided to do. And that's the GWA experience. It's irresisitible isnt it....

So my story... I had an email on my work account.

30,"Thanks for the kind words pun, but just remember - everyone finds their own take when it comes to scriptfilling. We all do the same thing, when we see an offer that strikes a note, and piques an interest, and then we'll go with the scene we imagine it's offering. The opportunity to provide our own flavour to what someone else is imagining. And that's GWA, sharing our thoughts so that everyone else can hear them, isnt it?. To just think 'what would I do...', and then let things just flow naturally.
