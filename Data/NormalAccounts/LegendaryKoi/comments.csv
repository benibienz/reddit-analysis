107,"&gt; Another way is if, they made a ""club TA"". In this the whole clubs TA is added together, and clubs will be matched that way.

I really like this idea. Sounds like a fair way to balance matches.

&gt;For example each person in the club picks one character to put on the ""clubs"" team.

I feel like this could have complications. Such as, everyone wants to put in their ""Bell"" or ""Metatron"". It would require a lot of coordination, probably more than what the matches warrant. And then that brings in the matter of ""weak links"" which can kind of subject them to feeling unworthy. 

&gt;add like a club ""stamina"" bar 

Valkyrie Crusade this something similar to this, but allowed refills with *rods*. The rod refills were rewards for participating in alliance battles, and more rods were given for winning the whole thing in the end. This added the strategy of ""blitz matches"" where at the end, there would usually be 5 minutes of 2X Points for battles, and people would spam matches at this moment to turn the tide when the enemy can't.

Clearly, you don't understand what is **skill** in a **card** game. ~~Or just straight up butthurt over your experience in Hearthstone~~

I suppose that they could make it like a cannon of some sort. They shoot once, but then they either can't shoot again (but passers will interfere with this) or their next shot is a bb-gun :)

And it's not like they're forcing you to whale for Nerua or Magnus and any upcoming damage reduction totem. They're just making it fair for every element by adding their own damage-reduction totem.
