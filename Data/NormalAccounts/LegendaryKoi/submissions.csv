9,2016-02-08 22:08:44+00:00,self.soccerspirits,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccerspirits/comments/44tbiq/discussionspeculation_the_future_of_clubs/,False,"As we all know, clubs have been released for a while without much change. But a recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccerspirits/comments/44pnj2/friend_and_club_recruitment_thread_february_08/czs58q0) has caught my attention, specifically the ""club merge"". I'm assuming most clubs are starting to gather dust, at least the ones at 50 who have no sign of any progress, mine included. But most definitely, BigBall is working on clubs ~~at least I hope so~~. 

And now the discussion starts. 

* **What do you expect from clubs in the future?** 

I would guess that nothing would change, except for maybe an increase in levels and capacity, an extra building or two, but nothing major. Maybe scaling rewards for monthly club ranking? That would be a cool idea wouldn't it? Although lower level clubs won't be able to get as much, competition would be less competitive among members. Which brings me to believe that they would remove the daily 490 points cap sooner or later. 

* **What do you think will happen during club matches?** 

Honestly, as a mobile card game, I don't believe club matches have many roads to take. What I see BigBall doing is following a system similar to *Valkyrie Crusade*, where you fight teams on the other side, gaining points for your own, losing still gives points, but not as much. The downside of this is the power that competitive clubs will be over the top, but to address this, Valkyrie Crusade held multiple guild battles at once, where 5 guild competed at once, since everyone has the same amount of battle balls. This will probably be followed vaguely by Soccer Spirits, but still stray away since SS would look for defining factors that don't put categorize them as generic mobile-waifu card games. Furthermore, I hope club matches will offer something new other than your average crystals, which is great and all, but limited items that you won't get again really push me to try for it.

* **So, what's after clubs?** 

Honestly, I'm not so sure myself. But what really kept clubs going in Valkyrie Crusade (once again relating to this, since I played it for 3-4 years, and therefore most familiar with) was being able to donate some kind of ""resource"" to get a special card only available through clubs. Soccer Spirits already has gold, and three currencies of GP (regular, season, and event) so this shouldn't be too overloading. Maybe use event points for ""club seasons which could represent Soccer/Football season"" Naturally, this would mean an increase in the amount of cards and thus a lack of distinctiveness between the cards, but let's face the facts. SS will not continue to make new and newer skills. This leads to power imbalance and old cards will drop out of the game extremely quick. 

**TL;DR** 

* 1.Clubs are getting dusty, I hope club matches will come soon or sooner. 

* 2.Ranking system within the club needs actual rewards.

* 3.Club matches will most likely be PvP, but not real time.

* 4.Exclusive cards only available to club members can lead to an increase in club activity/ cooperation.
