6,"BNWOT Gustin #27 Heavy American S38 Straight 

16.25oz, Cone Mills denim.

https://www.weargustin.com/store/4

I have had these for just over a year, tried on once, meant to get them hemmed, never did. 

I tried on again the other day and fit is tighter on me than last year. Pretty sure I grew over the last year versus them shrinking on their own.

Never soaked/washed, or worn for more than 10 minutes in the bathroom.

These are brand new, tags are off/gone.

$75 shipped CONUS, outside US will be dependant on shipping costs.
