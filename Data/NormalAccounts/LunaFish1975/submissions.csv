Did some research and decided on the Asus Zenwatch 2 from Best Buy, to which I had a $50 voucher to use. So that decision was easy.

I have been wearing it almost everyday, and at first I thought it might be a little too techy for me, although I do work in IT, but it has proven to be an incredible accessory to my Note 5.

I have a BB as a work phone that I have to carry as well. So this makes it easy to keep up with my personal phone business without having to pull my Note 5 out of my pocket Everytime I get an alert.

As most know, this watch can do a lot. For me it is the text messaging and gmail functions that I use the most, as well as the speaker function for calls when I am driving.

I am totally satisfied with this device.
I did not think I would be using it as much as I do, but I have to say this is pretty incredible.

I switched out the stock rubber strap for a leather one off of Amazon for $12. Also changed the background of the watch face to the MD flag. I get lots of compliments everyday. 

If you are thinking about an AW device, give this a serious look.

Cheers.

Not used to vaping at such a high wattage,  so looking to sell for $30 Paypal F/F or trade for another box. 

I had the vtc mini,  and now have a kbox120 with a subtank mini on it.  Also have a Herakles Sense Hydra. 

If looking to trade,  just tell me what you have to offer up. 

This is the full kit in black.  Only used the TF-Q4 coil for less than half a tank.

Everything in pic is included and all new. 

Thanks.

Marinated 4 racks for 24 hours in this:
Balsamic glaze
Instant coffee 
Chili powder
Paprika
Brown sugar
Honey
A touch of meat tenderizer 
Black pepper
Crushed cloves.

Mixed all together in a bowl, brushed both sides after removing membrane from underside.

After refridgerating for almost a day, I let them come to room temperature,  then dry wiped the excess marinade.

Got my Masterbuilt Propane smoker steady at 225°F added my pre-soaked cherry wood and off we went. 

Temperature bounced a bit due to the outside temp at 17°F. But smoker did a good job holding between 225-250°F. And I did this in the garage, with the garage door open 1/3 of the way.

The 3-2-1 method never fails.

During the 2 hour foil wrap I sprayed them with Ponzu sauce. Was trying something new this time.

They came out delicious. 

Although I think I could have increased the heat a little more on the last hour to get a little better bark.

Had friends over and they all enjoyed them. 


Thanks for reading my post.

So I want to have a better device to use on those occasions. 

Went with this:

A few questions:
1. Which brand battery should I go with?
2. How long should my coils last?

Thanks.

I have been a long time cigar smoker and have been enjoying pipe tobacco over the last year or so, but now my curiosities now have me looking in to snus.

I have read through this subreddit, followed the informational links and so on. But given all the brands and flavor profiles, I am not sure where to start out.

As far as cigars and pipe tobacco, I enjoy the scope of mild/sweet to strong/spicy.

With all that being said, does anyone here offer a ""sampler"" pack of sorts? I would be willing to pay a fair price (PayPal), or even offer cigars or pipe tobacco as a trade.

Maybe someone has some snus they did not enjoy themselves or can part with a few pouches of a few different varieties.

I appreciate any and all offers. 
Please let me know if you are interested in this.

Thanks to all.

New Balance M710v2 Trail Running shoe, for $18 delivered last week during the not so big online sale. 

Do I trail run?  Hell no.  

Can I always use a decent pair of grass cutting,  car washing,  garage cleaning,  run the kids between practices, forgot cat food at the store,  help a buddy move,  sure I'll  have another beer, pair of sneakers that do it all? Mother F'n yes. 

I must be on a roll. 

A few weeks ago I lucked out on the very last pair of Nike Solarsoft Moccasins in my size on the clearance rack at my local outlet store.  I wasn't thrilled about the purple/teal/hot pink zebra stripe colorway,  but for $10, how could I pass these up.  And they are as comfortable as an old man's pair of house shoes. 

Come on now,  how many other dads are right there with me? 

Funny, yes. 
True? Absolutely.  

These types of ""grail"" finds mean the rest of the family continues to walk in style.
