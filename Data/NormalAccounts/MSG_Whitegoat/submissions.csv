I recently got back into rs, and im really enjoying it. I decided to aim for max a couple of days back, and therefore i really need to get to priff (from what i understand). If you were me, what skills would you aim for right away, in order to get it asap? [My skills](https://i.gyazo.com/405f48a8b35f0b23b5e925df4061a84d.png)

Also, is it worth to join a clan?

I am kind of a newer player, with limited knowledge about RS. I recently came across (as in bough via TH), some protean items. I don't really know what skills to use them on, or rather if i should convert them to a specific protean item.

Can you, more experienced players, have a quick look at my stats and help me out with what skills to use these on. Like for example, idk if they are worth to use on smithing, or if i should go all out on hunter/crafting. I am planning to get all 99's... so thats kind of my goal as of now.
