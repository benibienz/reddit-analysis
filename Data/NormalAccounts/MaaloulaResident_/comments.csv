391,"I only caught the tail-end of this as you know, but I think you are taking what everyone said out of context. Firstly, I found it odd how you were saying that you were trolling with your apparent sarcastic right wing or ""Nazi"" views, and then you acted offended after people called you a Nazi. Now, I know it's hard to read tone and whatnot over the internet, but everything that people say in the IRC is supposed to be taken pretty lightly, it's mostly bullshitting. I also agree with you on the white man hate that is in there (I found it inappropriate and opposed it myself) and the ridiculous use of Nigga as everyone seems to want to be black these days. My point being is that you were sending mixed signals the whole time so it's not like anyone could properly decipher your view anyway. 

Anyways, I hope you join the Right and keep browsing this subreddit and /r/syriancivilwar.
