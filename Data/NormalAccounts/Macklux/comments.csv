Is it because that was all he needed to know to be sure he was looking at the missing woman's vehicle? Why check the year and make, but not the model and color?

The testing on the bullet was invalid by all scientific standards. The RAV4 being found on his property is suspect because Steven allowed them to search on the 3rd without hesitation. Colburn called in the plates that night with zero explaination as to why. The bones were moved from a place a mile or so away to right into Steven's yard. Why? Why was the county coroner not allowed on the property? Why were no pictures taken of the bonfire ashes and why didn't they use a grid? They destroyed evidence by doing so.  In my opinion, I don't see how any person could look at these facts and not have reasonable doubt. He is not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
