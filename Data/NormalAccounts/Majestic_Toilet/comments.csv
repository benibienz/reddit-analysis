Who knows, maybe all this would've been avoided. Maybe everything would have been alright in the end and the Great War would be a terrible future that never happened.

Round 2 is kind of a tossup, probably leaning towards Needler.

Round 3 goes maybe to the Buzz Blades guy, if only because both weapons' projectiles home in on their targets and just about any human wielding either of these would die from just a few hits, so it's really downt o projectile speed.

It would be a hundred times better if it had the aspect of fighting your up multiple floors as enemies follow you from all sides (rappelling in, stairwells, elevators, ect.)

More engagements that take place in interiors in general would be sweet. I'd like something where half of a battle is your operatives fighting through underground tunnels to their objective, and leaving involves hacking doors to slow enemy reinforcements or gain control of automated defenses, stuff like that. Could lead to some tense situations where your operatives are sneaking room by room, trying not to alert anyone, or frantic shootouts where everyone's trying to defend a junction as your specialist opens a blast door.",2016-07-11 09:19:52+00:00,d57oarw,5.0,t1_d57o7qg,316.0,Xcom

Or maybe there's a mission where Firebrand has to insert your squad on top of a moving ADVENT train and you can choose: kill a few guards and take a little cargo, or derail the whole thing and fight everyone once it comes to a stop for a larger haul?

53,"ROUND 1:

*Nomad, Commander Shepard, Jim Raynor, Samus Aran, and Master Chief stand at the edge of a cliff overlooking the afflicted village. In the distance, screaming, gunshots, flashes of purple lightning.*

""I tried to tell him there wasn't really a point,"" Shepard said. ""The librarian could have handled it on his own.""

""Maybe Doomguy just doesn't like zombies or something,"" Samus suggested.

A hamlet exploded into a thousand pieces as the unmistakable form of Praetorian armor burst from the flames, half of a bloody pair of legs in one hand and the scorched remains of what was once a human head in the other.

""...Yeah,"" Master Chief said dryly as the living dead collectively got the shit kicked out of them. ""Maybe he does.""

SMDT: 10-out-of-fucking-10 stomps

ROUND 2:

""Only a thousand?""

""I know, right?""

""Christ. It's gonna be a massacre.""

Space Marine 'Lol fuck ur shit' Dream Team stomps again on account of doomguy and librarian leading a charge of death and gunfire while everyone else provides overwatch from a rooftop.

ROUND 3:

""It is implied (in Wolfenstein RPG) that the original Doomguy is a descendant of William B.J. Blazkowicz destined to confront and finally defeat the Harbinger of Doom (Cyberdemon), after Blazkowicz had successfully destroyed its left arm and right leg after it had been summoned at Castle Wolfenstein during World War II."" - Doomguy notes

tldr; git gud, Hitler. The New Order is barely a speedbump if he were alone, as a team they wreck shop with ease.

ROUND 4:

Basically the same as round 1. Jim, MC, Nomad, and Shepard fire indiscriminately into the crowd of Uruk-hai until they run out of ammo, at which point they just let the rest of their more melee-proficient teammates mop it up. Rip and tear, doomguy. [Rip and tear.](http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/727284ac38a097f7ea7a7504642cbf0e-650-80.jpg)

ROUND 5:

A 10,000 strong army comprised of creatures doomguy shits on for breakfast and has been fighting for the better half of Hell's existence doesn't even begin to phase him. Everyone except for him and *maybe* the Librarian decide to play cards to relax since there's nothing better to do.

ROUND 6:

Now we're talking.

~29 kilometers of Covenant-infested starship isn't a walk in the park, but these guys could absolutely pull it off without any major difficulties. Master Chief and Nomad are both well-versed and equipped for stealth approaches into large hostile alien constructs. The rest of the team is sufficiently able to cause enough chaos to divert attention away from them while thinning the ranks of the ship's infantry complement all on their own. Assuming they all start together at the opposite end of the ship and choose to stay together sans the sabotage team, it's a relatively easy win. Shepard or Jim are the only ones in any real danger from the Covenant's plasma weapons, and their teammates are more than capable of helping to cover them while they deal plenty of damage all on their own. If the Covenant can force them to fight in a room large enough to house their heavier weapons (Hunters, Brutes, vehicles) and stay out of killzones, then they might have a shot at killing some but not all of the dream team.

ROUND 7: Oh boy.

It's honestly hard to say. Do the Orks get a really badass Warboss who's ready to start some shit, or is just a bunch of low level greenskins lead by a few Nobs, at best? Either way, it's a real fight this time. Possible casualties include Commander Shepard (odds of survival are higher if s/he is a biotic and/or infiltrator-class), Nomad, Raynor, MC, and Samus. Dream Team still probably wins, but they also probably lose some of their number in the process. Orks that are serious about their WAAAAAAGH! are some serious shit even for fully-equipped space marines.

ROUND 8:

""I have a gauss gun.""

""Same.""

""This is the best the UNSC fields in anti-materiel rifles.""

Shepard nodded. ""It'll do. Post up on that ridge over there, there, and there. We'll go for the joints. When they're immobilized, I'll soften it with the Cain and then we hammer the hell out of it with everything we've got. We clear?""

""Got it.""

""Good. Their shields are down so as long as we take them down one at a time-""

""Why's that one sparking?""

*Samus and Doomguy leap off the exploding remains of the Tripod they had just boarded as secondary explosions wrack its hull, collapsing into the dirt.*

""Oh.""

SMDT ""That was surprisingly easy""s their way to victory.

ROUND 9:

Barring Skynet suddenly growing magnitudes more competent than it has been, or time hax, there's no reason why SMDT can't do it. If John Connor and like, three other people plus one Terminator can do it, so can they.

ROUND 10:

107,"The monolithic letters weren't all that bright, his dining room probably had brighter light fixtures, but they were physically painful to look at. Maybe they were some new brand of SmartLight designed specifically to be aggravating to human eyes. Fresh waves of behind-the-eyeballs pain came every time Ted so much as inclined his head in the sign's general direction, as if its architect wanted to discourage people from reading the sign.

Which they probably did, if today's events were anything to go by.

""Well,"" Sandra said awkwardly, shifting her feet. ""Through here, then?""

She didn't seem to be affected by the harsh orange light, at least. ""Yeah,"" he decided, nodding at the salmon-tinted ground. His companion shuffled past him, unlocking the door with only a few muttering curses as he did his best to think of any color other than orange.

There was a muted clunk and a creeking as Sandra opened the door, and Ted dared to lift his head to make sure he wouldn't headbutt the wall. In doing so, he had just enough time to re-read the words that seemed to have grown three stories taller since the last time he looked at them.

""Love and secret government experiments"".

They were burned into his vision and his brain as if they had been put on a telepathic branding iron rather than neon. At least the next room was just white concrete, which, more importantly, wasn't goddam orange.

""Yeah, sorry about that. In hindsight I probably shoulda brought some Tylenol or something,"" Sandra rubbed her head sheepishly. ""You're gonna have to forgive me but I honestly didn't think we would get this far.""

""That's fine,"" Ted grunted out, blinking away the purple-black imprints from his eyes. ""Has anyone else made it this far?""

""A few, yeah. But it's been a while since I've been here. You're the first in like, a year.""

""Grea-""

*Cricka cricka cricka cricka cricka cricka cricka cricka*

To their credit, neither of them panicked. Sandra shouted ""The door!"" and Ted found himself already pulling it closed.

A trio of stark white arms that couldn't have belonged to a man exploded between the door and the frame, two of them jostling to keep it open while the third swiped madly for him. More of that godforsaken light spilled into the room, making Ted's vision pulse with pain. He felt its fingers tighten against his sleeves momentarily before pulling him forward, making his grip slacken-

*whirrr-BANG!*

An inhuman shriek echoed down the corridor as one of the limbs retreated, splintered and covered in a fine layer of vital liquids. Ears ringing, Ted breathed in the coppery air before giving one mighty heave—slamming the door closed and allowing the auto-locking mechanism to activate. A dismayed *skreeeeee* wailed behind the door, but the thing made no attempt to force its way in.

Ted got up and turned around to give a grateful nod to Sandra, but her attention was elsewhere. The railgun was lying against the smooth white walls as she stared attentively at a monitor built into the wall.

""What, another riddle?"" he managed in between gasps. Adrenaline was one hell of a drug.

""No,"" she whispered almost reverently. ""This, this is the real deal. I remember now, that sign wasn't just saying what this room contains, it's what this room *is.* This place is love in its simplest form, and secret government experiments.""

He frowned, uncomprehending. ""What's the monitor say?""

""It says Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer.""",2016-05-01 23:16:55+00:00,d2oyof9,3.0,t1_d2owzng,2898.0,CasualConversation

He posts a new song almost every day, and though I don't always like them he's got something for everyone on a rotation so that's nice.

Ask yourself, why do you play games? Is it to win or to have fun? 'Cause most people's answer will differ on the game. But no matter what, you gotta learn to disconnect yourself from the game. It's natural to want to win no matter what in a competitive setting, like a game. But at the end of the day when you lose a game, you only really have two options for yourself when you decide to play another game next time. You can get way, way better, or you can get better at accepting losing.

Basically, don't invest so much into it that you get pissed when you lose. Take my advice, I play Dota.",2016-04-23 02:54:34+00:00,d2dw7jx,1.0,t3_4g1nyq,2330.0,CasualConversation

I recall it very clearly though, the moment when I felt like I lost my... I don't know, childhood innocence? Happiness? The fourth grade had just ended, and I was looking forward to spending another few months escpaping the heat in the basement of my house, playing Ace Combat: Zero on the Playstation 2 and doing battle with my brother with the LEGOs we had.

Instead, my parents took us on a vacation to Singapore for all of June and most of July. I really don't get that. I mean, kid-me didn't fully appreciate travel or things like that, but even then I thought it was fun to go to another place, experience a new culture and see exciting things. I had a genuinely good time.

So when I got back and tried playing with videogames and LEGOs... it felt like something was missing. Let me explain; it didn't fail to entertain me, but it felt like whatever was in it that made it all-encompassingly fun was missing. Up until that moment, I had honestly never felt boredom in my life, but I did when I got home. I often wonder if, even though I wasn't consciously aware of it, did my going to see things that were new and difference make me more jaded to the ways I used to have fun? Because I liked to draw and to write and do all the things kids liked but now the energy and fun in them had... slackened.

Anyways, that was some heavy shit to ponder for the 5th grade onwards. Over the years some stuff happened like me dealing with my own emotions, realizing that I'm in dire straits as far as my financial situation goes since I'll need to pay for college tuition and housing. Depression. Regret. I wanted to put a gun in my mouth and make sure it was up against where the brain stem meets the spinal cord, but I realized I couldn't afford the bullets.

Anyways, I'm not particularly familiar with the Mad Max videogame, so I'm gonna request someone more knowledgeable enter this thread for more details, please.

Having said that, unless Mad Max is both exceedingly fast and strong, he'll lose round 1 almost immediately. Since you specified all Big MT upgrades, that means the Courier is massively stronger than him, and more durable to boot. If we add in other Big MT upgrades like you said, such as the near bullet-timing adrenaline-like drug [Implant GRX](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Implant_GRX) gives, then the Courier wins even faster.

Round 2: I really have no idea. A lvl 50 Courier is more than enough of a marksman to shoot out the tires or hit Max through the windshield, but having what I'm guessing is at least a semi-armored car is still a hell of an advantage.

Round 3: Leaning towards the Courier on this. Most of Max's weapons won't do much considering his target is, if naked, bullet resistant against low caliber weapons. And you gave him the best non-power armor in the game. Doesn't help C6 is familiar with the layout of the Sierra Madre. Courier 7/10 times.

Round 4: They work their way towards each other, slaughtering Ghost People and avoiding the Cloud the entire way through. Sadly this battle ends pretty much the same way the others would have gone: the Courier is too fast and way too durable for pretty much any regular human to fight, and thus Max gets shot, stabbed, and ripped apart.",2016-01-17 17:10:52+00:00,cz1n4zx,1.0,t3_41e6yb,2458.0,whowouldwin

391,"Lorewise, the only one that's solidly above all others is the Courier. Primarily because the Courier survives the events of Lonesome Road, full of the most difficult enemies in any Fallout game to date. Also the Courier's a cyborg, that's something none of the others have got, at least not to the same scale.

After that... hm. I'd say Courier &gt; Chosen One and Vault Dweller (who are roughly equal) &gt; Lone Wanderer &gt; Sole Survivor, although the LW and SS are also pretty much equal.

I'd also put emphasis on the fact that everyone is basically pretty much equal. But I was interpreting your question in terms of 'Who is the most powerful if we stripped them of all their weapons and armor?' If we include weapons then the Wanderer is a pretty good contender since he's got the experimental MIRV, and god knows the Gun Runners don't fuck around when it comes to supplying the Courier. The same can be said for the Chosen One and the Vault Dweller, dat Gauss weaponry.

If we include weapons SS is actually the weakest since barring getting an explosive legendary effect on a minigun there's nothing he's got that's better than anything the others can bring to bear.

With gameplay mechanics... either Courier or LW. Courier because you can take implant GRX to slow time and then turbo to slow time again. This causes what I'm not sure is a bug or not in the game engine, and causes weapons to fire extremely fast while the world is in slow motion. I've emptied hundreds of AP rounds from an LMG in a fraction of a second while under those effects. And like I said, the MIRV is nothing to scoff at, and neither is perma-invis Chinese Stealth armor for the Wanderer.

As for strongest gameplay companion, there are multiple contenders.

As you said, BoS Fawkes is strongest solo because of his health and his gatling laser.

Boone + ED-E are the strongest companion pair because they synergize like a motherfucker.

Strongest lore... possibly uh... X6-88 for the Sole Survivor. But that said that's lore wise. Gameplay wise anyone else would kick his ass. But supposedly coursers are on the level of Agent Smith from the Matrix so yeah.",2015-12-24 00:50:11+00:00,cy9k15m,1.0,t3_3y0lp6,7311.0,whowouldwin

The end result would be either a never ending stalemate, or the Institute *eventually* getting destroyed, over the course of, depending on the level of the Courier's involvement, years.

If the Courier and SS are not involved for either side, it's an endless stalemate. The Institute has nothing powerful enough to punch through Big MT, and Big MT sucks at power projection outside the dome. My reasons for saying this is that they're effectively stuck to their own experiments in the dome, but considering the mass of robots, lobotomites, and cyborgs under their control, no amount of even coursers is going to harm the Think Tank.

The Courier &gt; SS in every way, and should they ever encounter, one dose of implant GRX and turbo to slow time later = one dead SS. Doesn't help that the guy is just a normal human wielding guns that are meshed together and not a friggin' cyborg wearing powered stealth armor, for example.

Power armor has no energy shields, reaction time enhancing capability, is made of weaker material, isn't as good at dispersing heat from energy weapons, does not have as strong force-amplifying circuits, and it breaks apart far easier than MJOLNIR.

432,"Thanks, glad you liked it!

I considered it, but the only things that I imagine would work against the Clone's vehicles would be JAW spam to the point where CELL would need to fire a massively impractical number of missiles to take down the AT-TEs. As far as SW armored vehicles go, those things are the next best thing to an AT-AT.

Honestly if the cockpits are as exposed as I recall, it might be better to send in a few CELL snipers and spotters with the Gauss sniper rifles, firing and relocating using the abandoned skyscrapers as vantage points. But of course the clones could always send in more of their troops to man the vehicle, high mortality job as it is.

Thing about the Strykers though, they're armored enough to tank regular blaster fire just fine, but against the main gun on the AT-TEs and missiles from the LAATs, they can't win. Their best bet would be to encircle the missile towers and use the chaos caused by the guided rockets to assist them in lasting longer. Otherwise they're going to get turned into molten slag instantly. The TOW missiles would certainly help to kill/disable enemy vehicles, but there's just no way they can score a kill and not take heavy casualties at the same time.

I was operating under the assumption the towers outrange the AT-TEs, as otherwise the Clones would just stomp 9/10 times.

I agree on the LAATs not getting close enough to the towers without ground support, but CELL's air support is not nearly as impressive as the Clone's. At best, CELL has transport helicopters and the armored VTOLs, which to be fair pose a pretty credible threat. But they still can't compare to a LAAT in terms of sheer firepower. Plus in every game we've seen so far, the Ceph air units kind of suck at anything that isn't ground unit suppression.

I just think that the problem is, as far as the games and canon go, we've only ever seen CELL using light APCs, attack helicopters and VTOLs, buggies, turrets, and well-equipped ground troops. Also the towers. The problem is, they're an excellent *police and containment force.* They were meant to halt Ceph incursions and enforce peace and stop nanosuit operatives. The Republic is an *army.* They were meant to conquer.

The fundamental difference between the two that makes me think the clones would win is not the technology gap, although that is a factor. It's that CELL, in this scenario at least, is simply not equipped with any counter to heavy armored vehicles. Give them a few M1 Abrams, artillery emplacements, and way more aerial vehicles and they'll stand a chance. But as it stands, CELL's only shot at destroying, not disabling, the clone's heavy hitting units like the AT-TEs and LAATs are through Gauss snipers, which is a temporary solution, mass gunship and Stryker spam, which is suicide, or defending the towers with everything they have, which will result in a Pyrrhic victory, at best.",2015-12-13 06:53:47+00:00,cxxac74,3.0,t1_cxx8kgn,4063.0,whowouldwin

435,"Sorry for the late reply,

I say this in every thread involving anything from Crysis 2 and onwards, but the SCAR rifles are absolutely nothing to fuck with. They're essentially automatic miniaturized railguns that fire 4mm SABOT darts in upper-hypersonic velocities. That's like being shot by a very scaled down tank shell.

At that kind of speed with that much piercing force, the Clone's plastoid armor is useless at any range. Conversely, CELL's spidersilk Kevlar weave isn't going to save them from even glancing hits.

I'm going to assume two engagements. One where it's a squad of six CELL Operatives against six Clone Troopers. And one where it's everyone in the Liberty Dome against a Legion.

In squad-based combat, the CELL operatives will do slightly better. Their training is arguably not as good, but since they're all experienced mercenaries/ex-military it can be reasonably assumed they've seen more combat than the clones. More importantly, more combat against humans, enemies that can think and fight more creatively than CIS droids.

The CELL troopers make heavy use of cover and their grenades, attempting to flush the Clones into the open and shred them with their much higher rate-of-fire weapons.This succeeds to an extent, but the Clones have the benefit of a decade of training, and they prove to be the superior marksmen. It doesn't help that they only have to hit once to win. Assuming they have thermal dets, the Clones win much faster.

As for army vs. Army, let's assume that on a random Tuesday, a quarter of the Clones seen on Geonosis plus all their vehicular support are teleported at the very entrance to the Liberty Dome in Crysis 3.

CELL's aerial suppression towers light them up at first, succeeding in massacring a platoon or two of Clones, maybe even a few AT-TEs, but they are quickly taken down. The LAATs prove to be superior to any type of CELL aerial vehicle, dominating the airspace with few/no casualties. The Clone Army advances, their vehicles allowing them to navigate the rough terrain with ease, and heavy vehicles allowing them to vaporize any heavy CELL presence they come across. CELL retreats as far back as they can, prioritizing their remaining assets to defending the only things capable of stopping the Clones: The missile towers. They shoot down any LAATs that approach, driving them off, but the AT-TE's approach. From here it's a question of if the entirety of CELL can use their familiarity of run-down NYC to their advantage in halting the Clone advance and sabotaging their vehicle support since it's the best thing they can bring to bear. If they lose the towers then it's over.

Round 1: The Rookie knelt down gingerly, MA5K up and searching for targets. The VISR flickered into its different vision modes, showing off the Afghan desert in infrared and thermal.

Nothing. Ditto the motion tracker.

He stood up, and entered a hurried jog from the boulder he was hiding behind and towards the sandstone structure to his north.

Then he became aware of a stinging sensation in his thigh.

He whirled around, pulling the tranq dart that had sunk halfway into his BDUs but not reached his skin and bringing his weapon to bear in short order. The night sky was briefly lit up with flashes of automatic weapons fire as the MA5 chewed up the terrain around him, mulching the thin desert underbrush.

The only reason The Rookie was still standing a few seconds later was because he noticed one of the bushes 15 or so yards away move on its own.

Covered in what looked like a makeshift desert ghillie suit and brandishing a knife was the stereotypical picture of a URF field commander. Armor that looked like a vague offshoot of UNSC gear, mismatched weapons, and a beard that was *definitely* not cut to Corps regulations.

Aside from the fact that his mind automatically associated Innie leaders with 'capture if possible', the man's appearance did not immediately concern him. What was concerning was the prosthetic arm the soldier possessed, the rifle slung over his shoulder, and most importantly, the gun in his other hand.

Adrenaline coursed through his veins, and training took over.

Rookie opened fire immediately, and exactly two bullets escaped before the gun clicked empty and the Rookie swore while the rebel returned fire. *How the hell had he forgotten to reload?*

The first shot went wide, missing his target's head by an inch. The second grazed his left shoulder, but didn't do much more than momentarily stagger him.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, there was now a tranq dart embedded into his side. *Shit* Had it broken his skin?

Before the Rookie could contemplate any further, the man charged right at him, and the ODST couldn't help but notice the fact he was closing the distance in an alarmingly short amount of time.


Multiple things happened in quick succession.

The Rookie removed the dart from his ribs, fumbling slightly as the small amount of sedative began to work against him.

The Innie got within spitting distance. Fuck nonlethal.

He tossed the rifle and drew his dart pistol and knife, realizing where the fight was headed.

Then his opponent changed tactics at the last second and slid across the ground, intending to bring his pistol against the Rookie's unguarded ankle. Training screamed at him, and he brought his foot back, narrowly avoiding being clobbered as he raised his knife.

Not at all caught off-guard by the last-second maneuver, the rebel came up on one knee, and was immediately slashing with his knife. The Rookie jumped backwards, raising his own tranquilizer. He managed to squeeze off a single shot before the Innie pivoted on his foot, swiftly moving out of the way as the ODST fired. The dart flew off into the night, and the two closed to literal knife-fighting range.

Fortunately enough, forcing the rebel had dodge had left him exposed for half a second, which the Rookie used to his advantage.

The Rookie got in one swift jab to his solar plexus, and flipped his combat knife to a reverse grip. He was still in the middle of a slash to the man's femoral artery when he noticed his knife wasn't moving forward, and there was a cybernetic limb keeping him in place by the wrist.

Then the Innie *twisted* with more force than any organic limb could muster.

It took every ounce of his discipline and training to not cry out when the Rookie felt his wrist snap like a twig, the force of the maneuver causing him to do a front flip and faceplant onto the dirt.

The VISR cracked from impact, and he felt the wind get knocked from his lungs, but the ODST was far from defeated.

He dug his one good hand into the ground for stabilization, and shot his leg out in as powerful a kick he could manage.

He struck something *hard,* and heard a groan from above as the pressure on his broken bones slackened. The Rookie gave a grim smile before snatching up his knife, rolling over and preparing to drive it into the Innie's throat-

Suddenly there was an explosion of pain in his other arm, and the Rookie couldn't hold back his cry of pain this time. Had his opponent already recovered enough to thwart his attack? He scrambled to his feet, injured hand guarding his chest as he returned to a fighting stance with his knife.

The Insurrectionist was already up and looking no worse for wear, knife in his hands.

Rookie took a breath, and steadied himself. His legs pumped like pistons, and shot him forward in an attack based on nothing more than desperation and adrenaline. His swipes were wild and unpredictable, but also impossible to block. The Innie jumped backwards, bringing his own knife to bear but keeping it close to his chest, choosing to avoid the attacks by giving up ground rather than counter.

It was when the ODST made the mistake of taking too long on an overhead strike that the man made his move.

He feinted with a punch to the temple, which the Rookie instinctively parried as he continued to strike with the knife. He rolled forward as the blade came down, hitting nothing but air as he came up behind the Rookie.

The Rookie tried to elbow him, and felt his injured arm being grappled. *Oh fuck not again.*

He pushed off his feet, and they both tumbled backwards onto the hard terrain. The rebel grunted in pain, and the Rookie used the fact he was wearing a very well-armored helmet to his advantage, slamming it backwards into his enemy's head.

Not to be outdone, he felt an artificial hand grab him by the chin and yank upwards, exposing his relatively unarmored neck to the air and allowing Venom to stab him in the trachea with a knife, causing him to bleed out in minutes.

443,"“…ar me?”

Courier Six awoke with a start, the Ranger Sequoia ripped from its holster and pointed squarely at the man in front of her before she had time to open her eyes, an instinct developed by anyone who survived long enough in the Wasteland.

“Whoa, hold it!” came a synthesized-sounding voice. Standing in front of her was a man wearing the [oddest set of armor she had ever seen](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8015/191921-7024-clone-trooper.jpg). Smooth white plates covering a black bodysuit, culminating in an almost gasmask-like helmet. “We’re all frendlies here!”

*Like Hell*. “Who are you.” She demanded flatly, keeping the gun trained on his center of mass. Advanced armor or not, a .45-70 at close range would fuck up anyone’s day.

“Clone Commander Greer,” he responded with calm not befitting a man staring down a loaded gun. What the hell kind of name is that? “I realize this isn’t an easy ask, but you’re going to have to trust me for now.”

“Yeah? Why?”

“Maybe take a look around?”

She did.

What. The. Fuck.

Instead of the familiar bedroom suite of the Lucky 38’s hidden apartment, she was in some type of hangar-like room. Gunmetal grey armor plating covered the walls and ceiling, and some type of linoleum-like black material made up the floor, so spotless she could see her reflection clear as day.

That wasn’t what caught her attention though. It was the translucent moving blue barrier in the far end of the room. More specifically, the sight beyond it.

Earth. Still green with vegetation.

Was this… Was this before the Great War? Was this the future?

Greer cleared his throat, and she was stirred from her reverie. “You trust me now?” She didn’t respond. He kept talking.
“While I’d love to chat, we’re getting new arrivals all over the ship. Go through those doors and follow the signs until you get to the bridge, they’re having a meeting,” he told her, gesturing to some sliding doors. “You’ll get answers there.”

“I-“ she started, only to be interrupted.

“Oh, and before I forget, what’s your name?”

“Courier.” She replied. “Of the Mojave Wasteland. Where are we?”

“Oh you’re a Courier? We got a few more of people like you.”

“What do you mean like me-“

Then a miniature explosion of lightning and fire appeared directly behind her, disappearing with a puff of smoke and depositing a comatose man wearing the most intricate set of [armor she had ever seen, including the clone. It looked like someone had merged human muscle cords, scales, and armor together with an emphasis on red, black, and silver coloring.](https://i.imgur.com/HEnHBmL.jpg)

He too sat up in alarm and pulled out what was very clearly an assault rifle, adorned with white hexagons. “Where am I?” he demanded, as the Courier felt an odd sense of déjà vu.

“Just…” Greer stopped. “You want to-“ 

“Yeah, sure,” The Courier nodded, already understanding. “Come on man, we’re going to the bridge. What’s your name?”

The strange man kept his gun on her, Damn if this isn’t familiar, “Why should I tell you that?”

“Because fuck all logic, apparently,” she answered flippantly,” gesturing to the mysterious space-door. “Honestly I don’t even know much more than you, I got here a few seconds ago.”

“So?” he asked her, the hostility not leaving his voice. She really didn’t want to get shot today.

“So we’re not going to find answers here, and if you want to stay and try to demand answers like I did when I got here you’re welcome to. But I plan on getting answers.” And just like that, she began to walk away.

Predictably, the armored man was walking next to her in seconds. They passed through the doors at the far end of the hangar swiftly as the Courier flicked glances upwards, following every sign that pointed to the bridge.

“Name’s Prophet,” he grumbled at last, the synthetic voice almost rumbling in her ears. “Where are we?”

“Courier Six,” she responded. “As for where, high orbit of Earth.”

He stopped momentarily, and so did she to stare back at him. “What- how?”

She shrugged. “I genuinely have no fucking clue, that guy back there just told me there was a meeting on the bridge and we’d get answers there.”

“This… This doesn’t-“

“You guys new too?”

Six looked to her left, momentarily confused by the sight. Standing in the adjoining corridor was a man with… cybernetic arms, and a hexagon imprinted onto his forehead, walking with another man with the weirdest glowing blue helmet she had ever seen, and a man wearing a Vault-Tec suit.

“Yeah,” she answered after giving them a once over. “I’m Courier Six. This is Prophet. Who are you guys?”

“Adam Jensen,” the cyborg answered. “This is Isaac, and that’s the Vault Dweller,” he finished, gesturing to strange-visor and Vault jumpsuit respectively.

Suddenly, her eyes widened as she realized who was standing in front of her. “Holy shit,” she breathed. “Seriously?”

The Vault Dweller looked at her, blankly. “Do I know you?”

“It’s an honor to meet you, sir,” she blurted out quickly, losing her composure for a second. “I… Holy shit. Can I get your autograph?”

“Are you really famous or is she just a stalker?” Isaac asked him, throwing what she could only assume to be confused glances at both of them.

“I… don’t know?” The Vault Dweller offered.

Jensen snorted. “That sentence accurately summarizes everything that’s been happening today.”

“Bridge is through here, right?” Prophet asked impatiently.

“I think?” Isaac said. He flicked his wrist out, and a glowing blue line started at his feet and ended at the metal blast doors in front of them. “Yep.”

Courier Six and the Vault Dweller exchanged glances. “You really don’t know? You’re one of the biggest heroes in the NCR, hell the whole West Coast!”

“I’m sorry, the NCR actually worked?” The Vault Dweller asked her.

Then the doors opened, and they were greeted with the sight of Master Chief, Every hero in Dota 2, multiple copies of the protagonists from Fallout 1, 2, 3, 4, NV, as well as Skyrim, the Borderlands protagonists, a veritable army of Call of Duty soldiers including Task Force 141 and various U.S. Blackops teams, several Space Marines, Eldar, Tau, Daemons, Orkz, various Commander Shepards, a legion of jedi and clones, CIS droids, Darth Vader and Palpatine, everyone in Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Solid Snake, Faith from Mirror’s Edge, Max Caulfield, all the survivors from Left 4 Dead and Killing Floor, Rico from Just Cause, Gordon Freeman, a holographic projection of literally thousands of ACUs from Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, The Boss from Saints Row, The Team Fortress 2 Mercenaries, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, entire teams of elite XCOM operatives, multiple Guardians from Destiny, the protagonists of Sanctum 1 and 2, a car from Rocket League, more SPARTAN III and IV supersoldiers than could be counted, Jack, Subject Delta, and Booker from Bioshock, whoever the commander of Star Wars: Empire at War and Forces of Corruption is, The leader of the largest space-faring empires of Spore, Spyro, and a shitload of generic soldiers from Battlefield, Cortex Command, and Starcraft.

“What the fuck.”

“That’s what I said,” Master Chief muttered.

446,"True enough, but the Sole Survivor was enough to kill one on his own during the main quest. It's not going to be an easy battle no matter who wins, but considering X6 is going to be going up against the Courier, Power armored-Arcade, and Lilly he's not going to survive for long. The Coursers may be the best combat-oriented synths the Institute's ever produced, but I stress that the NV team has access to way better weaponry.

Plus as some other people have pointed out, a maxed Courier would probably have taken the implant GRX perk, which would mean their team leader is constantly seeing things in slow motion but can still act and respond extremely fast.",2015-11-29 22:15:04+00:00,cxh6z7o,3.0,t1_cxh6lhx,610.0,whowouldwin
447,"Oh no I agree, Fallout 4's massive amounts of perks do actually end up equalizing things. Onto the custom PA the Survivor has, armor is just armor. It'll keep you alive but unless you have a way of damaging your enemy you're not gonna get too far. After all, it's not particularly difficult to shoot power armored soldiers in the head with the .50.

ED-E is not an immensely strong combatant, but he *does* have an amazing sensor suite, which Boone benefits from, hilariously. As for MaCready, I suppose he could put up a fight, but he's just a better-than-average mercenary. Boone is one of, if not the greatest sniper the NCR 1st Recon ever had.

448,"So firstly, let me just say that there are some reasons why I think this is in the Courier's favor, at least most of the time.

Firstly, after the events of visiting the NV Medical Clinic and Big MT, the Courier is a cyborg who at the minimum, has a reinforced spine that makes him inherently stronger and more durable, a skull that is literally resistant to small-arms fire, and has boosted SPECIAL stats as well as passive HP regen and sub-dermal armor.

Although having said that the Sole Survivor could conceivably match that, if he's got all the perks and maxed SPECIAL, minus a few parts of the cybernetics but it kind of equals out.

Secondly, the Courier is using actual weapons that in some cases are made and manufactured by the Gun Runners, who are making things like explosive .50 caliber rounds and Anti-material rifles in an actual factory as opposed to just making one out of a hunting rifle. I do see that you considered that about weapons and will take it into account.

Round 1: Courier 6/10, possibly just an even 50-50. S/he's going to be much faster than the Survivor, and could probably shoot out critical pieces of the armor, which is the Survivor's biggest advantage here, using the Anti-mat rifle or the Ranger Seqouia, on account of those weapons both being superior to their East-Coast counterparts. If weapons are uniformly distributed then it's hard to say who wins.

Round 2: This is kind of one-sided. Arcade is wearing the most advanced series of Power Armor ever devised, Boone and E-DE are automatic GGs, and Lilly is a first-gen supermutant with an automatic weapon and a Super Sledge. The only major players I see on SS's side are Danse, Strong, and X6-88. Everyone else is either not durable enough to last in a fight, or doesn't deal enough damage, possibly both (although NV has a few of those as well.)

452,"Who the hell knows, man. I'm a traveling guard with some of the caravans that travel across the country every few years, so I know a little of what's going on but even then it's mostly rumors.

All I know is it was between the New California Republic and some sorta Legion of slaves. We were leaving the area at the time so all we heard was over the radio, but it was supposedly a really close fight, if you can believe that. Dunno how but that's the way the stories went.

Anyways, the details are fuzzy on who won, exactly. I know the Legion got destroyed for sure, we could see the fires and explosions from their settlements for miles. But I really don't got a clue who won. Radio broadcasts stopped after the Legion got defeated.

Now, you would assume that NCR had won the day 'n' shit right? Everyone wins and goes home? That's where we're all uncertain. At the same time, there were other stories of somebody just called the ""Courier"" who was at the battle. That's right. Some random-ass mailman showed up with... who the hell knows what. Some people say it was an army of robots at his side, or a pre-war bomber flying cover for her. I don't know what the hell to believe. That said, supposedly the city of New Vegas is under the Courier's management, *if* those rumors are to be believed.

But I don't buy any of that, it'd take a hell of a lot more to stop NCR, even if those stories are true.

&gt;My problem isn't with the cost at all. My problem is with people saying it would be prohibitively expensive to outfit an AI with Mjolnir armor instead of a Spartan. I just bring up the SIIIs because they're the poster children in that universe for not being cost effective yet still allowed to exist.

It's even less cost effective to outfit a suit of MJOLNIR with an AI. The armor alone costs about as much as a completely crewed and outfitted heavy frigate. Add an AI on top of that, one that's at least as small as the suit and not a giant mainframe that spans much of a starship, and you have yourself something that costs so much you may as well have just trained some spartan IIIs or even a II.

Can't send ODSTs, despite being the best they can be they're only human.

506,"What, like movie or comic Iron Man, and with what suit?

A month of integration would be immensely powerful, considering the Nanosuit's nanobots, under the control of the Nanosuit's built in AI, SECOND, plus the MJOLNIR's onboard computer system could fine-tune the suit to great degrees. Little abilities from the game, like thruster packs to quickly dodge attacks, staying cloaked while stabbing someone to death, things like that.

Odds are the operator could kill movie Iron Man pretty easily if given the element of surprise, which it could certainly have. With the combined power output one could easily stay cloaked for... maybe even days, just waiting with a sniper rifle to blow his brains out whenever he walks out of his house.

Now if Tony were suited up and was staring at the hybrid suit which is 10 meters away from him, it'd be a hell of a fight, and greatly depend on the armanents of the operator. Halo weapons wouldn't do much unless we give him Covenant/Forerunner weapons and a Spartan Laser powered by the suit. Or maybe some of the higher end Crysis weaponry, which is actually really powerful.

So, Movie Iron Man I'm not sure about. Maybe 6 or 7/10 in favor of hybrid operator, if only because the extended cloak allows for massive tactical advantages when combined with the fact it can [score headshots while firing from the hip after leaping off tall buildings pretty much instantly.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6W_FcUpOig&amp;t=1m0s)

507,"That picture is exactly what I think of whenever I see the Nanosuit/MJOLNIR merging threads pop up.

And it would be hilariously powerful. Thing is, MJOLNIR on its own is bulletproof against basically anything that's not a hypersonic anti-materiel rifle. Modern versions are heavily resistant against plasma that exceeds 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and contains its own immensely powerful reactor which can run indefinitely for a hilariously long amount of time.

Combine this with the Nanosuit V2.0, which for its setting is so massively fucking overpowered, and not a lot of people realize that. [See this list,](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2t7yrd/master_chief_vs_prophet_crysis/cnwnz3a)

What's more, the suit automatically repairs both itself and the user in a matter of seconds. Meaning that this is a soldier that can passively regenerate both armor and flesh almost instantaneously upon leaving combat.

And the suit abilities would be too strong for almost anyone to handle. Armor mode could be sustained for even longer than it already could, and combined with the already durable nature of MJOLNIR, would take extensive amounts of even plasma or anti-vehicle weaponry to take down. Let alone the fact the reactor and Nanosuit's energy generation could keep the cloak running for several times longer than it already can.

I mean holy shit, the entirety of the events of Crysis 2, from Alcatraz being suited up to destroying the Ceph spire in Central Park took less than a week. And in that time, the Nanosuit 2 synthesized not just a cure to the Manhattan Virus, but also reversed its effects, *and* made it even more potent, killing the Ceph instantly upon exposure. *While Alcatraz was still fighting CELL and Ceph soldiers throughout NY.* The suit is ridiculously smart on its own just to do that automatically.

526,"Holy shit that was exciting to read.

So I like the series a lot, my favorite's The Outcast Dead by Graham McNeill. Love his writing style.

So about the fight, I realize that the binary rifle has that horrible weakness about being scoped in, and would counter that it is entirely possible that Ultimate Chief could fire it reasonable well without having to use the scope.

See this video for [evidence:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6W_FcUpOig&amp;t=1m0s)

He scored a headshot on one of the soldiers on that rooftop, while firing from the hip. Furthermore, the [SECOND](http://crysis.wikia.com/wiki/Semiautonomous_Enhanced_Combat_Ops:_Neuro-integration_Delivery_AI) (sorry this page doesn't play it, only one I could find) AI system built into the nanosuit alone integrates into his brain, allowing him to do many things normal humans couldn't do. Anticipating where a bullet's going to hit from a gun while firing without being scoped in, for example.

I think given what you'd told me, he'd still probably lose, but its 6 or 7/10 in favor of the Space Marines. Binary Rifle might be able to kill 2, maybe even 3, but from there on out its a straight up fight between at best, two hostile Space Marines.

Although it should be noted that at this point, between the Crytek Nanosuit, MJOLNIR, the SSS, and Witcher mutations + Guardian properties, Chief could feasibly move as fast as a Space Marine. At the very least, he would be as good as one in a fight, not sure if he could win the 1v2 thing I said earlier without significantly better weapons.

You're amazing at writing, by the way.

About the Z-250, I think it was in one of the Forerunner books, and I don't think they mention it by model, but the standard Promethean light rifle is extremely powerful. I don't have the book with me, but at one point a Knight missed and the stray shot vaporized a mountain. Like, left a gigantic glowing orange crater several miles in radius after atomizing the rocks. SM armor likely could not resist it. The only reasons the Spartan IVs were supposed to be capable of surviving combat with the Knights is cause of their shields, and even then an awful lot died on Requiem with little to show for it.

I should note here though, although its not confirmed, it is widely considered that the Prometheans were using weaker variants of their hardlight weapons, hence why you didn't see the mountain-destroying feats from a single shot from their basic rifles in the game. Although that's also gameplay and story segregation.

Although it should be noted the Z-250 does not have the weakness of the binary rifle in that it has a higher magazine, better fire rate, and it does not send a highly visible line out from its barrel. It could feasibly wipe the Space marines if Chief hides in a building far from them and ambushes, but I am unsure.",2015-09-06 22:51:42+00:00,cuswe8y,12.0,t1_cusvpcf,1401.0,whowouldwin

The problem with it, for me at least, was the Empire was flawed but the only truly stable solution possible. It could be a great solution, but only with massive internal improvement. The rebels would only bring instability or at the very least serious problems for the future of Tamriel even if they won in the form of famine as a result of war, for example.

So for me it was a simple question of do I keep the Empire held together by a flawed system or do I tear it apart and hope for the best that Ulfric isn't a power hungry lunatic? I can see your point though, it's not entirely black and white, but not quite grey-grey either.",2015-09-01 02:21:39+00:00,cuml7j2,7.0,t1_cuml21t,250.0,Fallout
558,"Personally I just genuinely believe their writing isn't that great. I don't think it's *impossible* for them to make a good story, but they haven't made one in a long time.

The main quest for F3 was literally choose to kill a ton of people for basically no reason or sacrifice yourself when you could bring along a radiation-immune companion, who if you use the narrator will tell you off for being a piece of shit instead of dying needlessly.

See Skyrim, with its okay main story, to be honest I kind of liked it and thought it was alright, and the somewhat shittier civil war.

Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Bethesda. They are capable of making good stories, see Dawnguard and some of the side quests from Skyrim or even Fallout. It's just that those well-written quests are outliers rather than the norm.

I'm sorry if I came off as hating them for no reason. I just don't particularly trust them to come up with a great main story for the game. That said, I hope I'm wrong.

You don't sound like a dick at all, and I'm very much aware of how ridiculously overpowered I wrote the Courier as. I just think the last sentence of that epilogue I wrote is most important:

&gt;I am aware this is an unrealistically good ending, that is neither canon nor possible within the game. At least, not most of it. It was mostly meant as a story of ""If the Courier was actually capable of doing what someone who really wanted to rule but was just as overpowered as the games depict, what would happen?""

Trust me, I was aware of what I was doing.

How many of those grunts I slaughtered were only fighting because it was the only option left for them when their homes were destroyed?

I'll admit, essentially torturing an infant to get a cure isn't by any means a great option, but it's Fallout. It's never ideal.

That aside, I blame Bethesda for only really having two endings, as usual. Help Ashur, or help Werhner.

Some people will try to live their life to a degree that provides a sense of fulfillment and happiness to themselves. Things like having a family, a job you love, people to care for and people who will care for you, that type of thing. In general, just living a happy life will guarantee a high score and a long life worth living.

Alternatively you can try what Rick was doing and take a different approach, taking Roy off the grid and living in the wilderness. It is unknown if this was successful or not in beating Morty's score, but Rick seemed confident that it would be able to ""thrash your Roy score, Morty.""

EDIT: Full format kind of fixed it. I could copy a 2 GB movie to the flash drive in about 1 minute.

658,"I mean, if they all work together the US assault would probably stall and fail over time by attrition alone.

Thing about Strangereal is, they had *very* small amounts of nuclear materials. Hence whenever anyone in the games has a nuke, everyone's freaking the fuck out cause those are rarely seen.

As a result of there being basically no nukes, every military is highly reliant on massive armies, air forces, and occasionally superweapons/superplanes/the greatest aces of all time.

Purely on the basis that the United States will be facing off against a series of countries, all of which are pretty much heavily militarized as it is, they will not win. They might be able to take Osea since you said no superplanes, although they might get thwarted by the efforts of the Razgriz squadron.

Round 1 the US stomps since the massive amounts of nuclear weapons it has that could be deployed would annihilate the unprepared forces of Strangreal.

Round 2: The whole Earth? Possibly Strangereal, again because they're all highly militarized. Even without superweapons, as long as there are no nukes involved they could at least fight Earth to a standstill or an extremely costly victory.",2015-07-18 01:10:05+00:00,ct78fvg,1.0,t3_3doqxb,2148.0,whowouldwin

676,"I mean, the ice weapons from even the first game, where the Ceph were ill-suited to deal with humans, worn from hibernation and some natural damage, were a hell of a threat. As I said, a single shot tore through a sandbag, something a .50 cal round can't do, and then killed a soldier on the other side. It's definetely got enough mass and density to do some damage. It's certainly got enough speed to make MJOLNIR's shields flare.

The nanosuit even has a faster reaction time than Chief. See this thread's top comment https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2t7yrd/master_chief_vs_prophet_crysis/.

Oh I'm aware he didn't kill them, just more or less prevented them from remaining a physical object.

That would certainly explain why the weapons were, you know, manageable when it came to being shot at by hardlight weaponry, but if that's the case, where was it said that Requiem was a fortress to fight the Flood? As far as I know it was just a place to imprison the Didact, but I could totally be wrong.

Also, the Flood-Forerunner era Flood were massively more powerful than the ones seen in say, Halo 3. Mainly due to reverse engineering Forerunner systems. So by extended logic, if the Prometheans there truly were meant to combat Flood, or even act as security against the Didact, it would stand to reason they would have a standard Forerunner arsenal. It makes zero sense why they'd have weapons that are only somewhat better than what humans are using in 2557.

Anyways, we're getting a bit off topic. I still say Prophet would win, purely from the fact that the suit took him from a clinically dead man to reviving him in a few hours, and granting him more strength, speed, better invisibility that fooled even the Ceph, and more. Even the speed and strength part are passive that don't even require the armor to enable that, although they can be greatly enhanced to be even more powerful than they already are.",2015-07-10 00:12:01+00:00,csy1e8h,13.0,t1_csy12gr,613.0,whowouldwin
677,"Nah you don't sound ignorant, in hindsight I should have clarified why I put that there.

I included the excerpts because you put in statements about how the Ceph weren't that advanced in the fields of weaponry compared to the Covenant. The reason I put those in, are because it was talking about a virus which the Ceph more or less made with the same amount of effort it takes you or me to make a paper airplane. It took them all of what, 2-3 days to make, mass produce, and distribute it in a format that had Alcatraz not intervened, would have completely killed every single human on earth.

All using a virus that they synthesized overnight, and more effective than any bioweapon ever made by man.

Personally, I doubt the SCAR would do much to MJOLNIR in the same way UNSC weapons wouldn't do much to the Nanosuit. The shields would deflect at least a full mag before popping, and the nanosuit could easily shrug off fire from an MA5. The ice based Ceph weapons I'm not sure about, it would probably do some damage on the same level as a plasma rifle but that's not important since Prophet doesn't have access to those.

I vaguely remember something about Bungie saying that ""Heroic"" is the canonical difficulty for Halo games, but that's about it.

Reason I said that the canon kinda contradicts itself, is for example, the Promethean Knights. In lore, they're an army of self-repairing teleporting highly advanced robots that are functionally immortal and use tactics and superior firepower to overwhelm anything. I mean, a simple hardlight rifle ought to be able to vaporize a mountain in one shot, according to lore. Meanwhile Chief just takes on an army of them and comes out no worse for wear.

What makes it inconsistent is that Chief is established as a powerful Spartan who can clearly prove a powerful match for any Covenant army, but by all rights he should be annihilated by a single Knight if we're going by lore. And since the games take precedence over the lore as you said, which I agree with, that means that Chief canonically fought through all those Knights on Requiem and survived. I'm not even talking about surviving the composer or anything like that, but just getting shot once by a hardlight weapon of any kind should have vaporized him and his armor in an instant.

Doesn't make much sense to me in the same way that Alcatraz/Prophet get taken down by EMPs that their suits are specifically shielded against.",2015-07-09 23:36:27+00:00,csy08a5,11.0,t1_csxzvev,635.0,whowouldwin
678,"The human weapons in Crysis are leagues better than the UNSC mainly because the most widely used one is the [SCAR](http://crysis.wikia.com/wiki/SCAR) which is basically a science fictioney version of the real life XM-8 assault rifle.

Basically it fires 4mm SABOT rounds, which are more or less scaled-down versions of the projectiles that modern day tanks fire from their main gun. At hypersonic velocity no less. Even the regular infantry body armor is pretty ridiculous. Supposed to be some kind of spider silk weave that's multitudes stronger than Kevlar.

As for Ceph being advanced, their basic weapons, like the ice-firing projectiles seen in Crysis 1 can shoot through sandbags, come out the other side, and then kill a soldier wearing aforementioned spider silk armor.

Also consider these excerpts from Crysis: Legion:

""Explosive catalytic autolysis I think, and somehow I know what that means.
I’ve seen bioweapons in my time. I was there when Egypt laid that pimped-out necrotizing fasciiti down on the Syrians, back at the start of the Water Wars: You could see it eat the meat right off the bones in realtime, like it was some kind of Discovery Channel time-lapse. Those poor bastards die in minutes; the wounds actually steamed because the Strepto’s metabolic rate had been cranked high. They had to retcon a whole new suite of bacterial enzymes just to handle the heat.

Next to this, that was nothing. I’ve never seen anything kill this fast.""
(Alcatraz recounting when he fought against an agent similar to the Ceph engineered plague, and then comparing it to this.)

""When I saw those first few victims I assumed it was just some random alien fungus or something, you know, like that flesh-eating disease. But it’s more than that. It doesn’t just eat you, it doesn’t just turn you into a walking mass of tumors. First it reprograms you. It gives you purpose. Something to live for, something to die for. Some of those guys, you’d swear that getting raptured was the best thing that ever happened to them.

Sometimes I almost found myself feeling envious.

Not everyone down there was CELL, of course. There were some good guys as well. Every now and then I’d see MPs or medics from the Red Cross trying to intervene, Dude, it’ s a meat-grinder in there, you keep going that way Squiddie will have you for appetizers. But the infectees, they didn’t care. They wanted to meet the Squids, they wanted to be consumed, it was like their own personal ticket to sit at the right hand of Jesus H. Christ in the Great Hereafter. I even saw a couple of Bible-thumpers, they snuck into the zone on some kind of self-appointed missionary patrol. It was almost funny, watching them try to unsave all these poor doomed bastards who’d got to “Heaven” before them. But those CELL goons, man, they weren’t interested in saving souls. All they were after was something to kill that wouldn’t fight back.""

I'd also like to point out if this is post Crysis 3 Prophet, we are talking about a guy who survived atmospheric reentry and is wearing a suit that is very capable of withstanding much the same things Chief is, and it also has an AI built in to it as well.

Alcatraz is definetely a hell of a lot stronger than Chief, even if the suit isn't switched to strength mode or has low power. At the very *least*, he could match him for strength. And it's not like he's not capable of just sitting, invisible, waiting for chief to walk by, then shooting him with a microwave laser. Or even just focusing a lot of energy into his hand and punching.

Besides, if you want to complain about how the canon is inconsistent, look at the Fall of Reach, or the Halo books where Chief is supposed to be significantly stronger than he is in the games, and compare that to events in the games where Chief is consistently way stronger/weaker than he should be in multiple areas.

That said, lore nanosuit wrecks Chief every time. See this thread https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/crysis-feat-tech-thread.310537/ for additional feats.",2015-07-09 22:59:07+00:00,csxyyz8,9.0,t1_csvvbwv,152009.0,whowouldwin

This is also irrelevant since you stated in the OP that it can only construct defensive structures and a factory's entire purpose is for offensive attacks.

On a side note, I'm not sure if you wrote those in as special circumstances for this fight in particular or not, but there is no way in hell that a mini-nuke could destroy a T1 turret of any kind in one hit, nor pulse grenades. Let's not forget it takes hundreds of shots from multiple T1 assault bots, which fire bullets that are as big as most humans.

That said, unless the Enclave just sorta bombards them from orbit by stealthily marking it with a laser designator or something, they can just use the mass and energy to power their buildings and create new power armor suits or try and create very basic combat robots from the Fallout universe.
