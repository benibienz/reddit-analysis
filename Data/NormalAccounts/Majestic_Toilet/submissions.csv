I used to have a group chat thing on Messages on my old phone, for talking to a bunch of other people over text in the stock Messages app. This brings me to the problem I'm currently facing.

Now whenever my friends try to text me in the group thing, instead of me seeing their messages in one conversation I got them all in separate conversations. And I have no problem replying but since the messages don't spawn a group conversation I can only reply to one person at a time. In short, I can read every message but I can only view and reply to them one person at a time.

Anyways, if anyone has experience with this I'd appreciate it. I tried to search online but other people who had issues like this dealt with their messages not sending or being received, not this where I flat out can't send messages to more than one person.

Furthermore, a strange portal-like device was found in one of the lower-levels of the city, in addition to some near skyscraper-sized crates in a forgotten storage bay...

Time passes. Decades. Now a new generation of clones has been completed, with full training and equipment. New training modules too, have been fabricated. Undaunted by the prospect of being alone in dark space, the upgraded clone army prepares to explore the portal. It's a shame they can't configure where the portal leads to.

Can they liberate at least half of Earth from Reaper ground forces as of the events of Mass Effect 3?

So here we go again.

From previous thread, ""Inspired by the previous [Super Master Chief thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2yfrfg/how_far_can_my_super_master_chief_go/), I decided it wasn't absurd enough and we had to go further.

During the final stages of the battle at Requiem, Cortana sent one final burst of data to the Master Chief's armor while in her death throes. In it was sensitive data that the Forerunners had gathered and cataloged on an invasive species of the Milky Way, the Ceph (Crysis). As the years went by, eventually all suits of MJOLNIR were integrated with Nanosuit 2.0s[2] , combining its advanced tactical abilities with the already powerful suits of human power armor.

Shortly after, the Chief was stationed on the Infinity to hunt down remaining Insurrectionists and Covenant remnants. On the way, they discovered an abandoned Insurrectionist base that had been attempting to reverse engineer ancient yet advanced technology from an 21st century Earth organization known only as XCOM.[3] While most of the data was unusable, they did discover interesting methods of testing for psychic abilities in their soldiers. Further testing revealed that the Master Chief was actually very compatible with the project, and he was assigned to further testing to increase his psychic abilities.

A year later, after being thoroughly trained and honing his psi strength, Crysis Psi-Chief continues to serve on the Infinity, until they find an intact Forerunner Shield World. Discovering it is not hostile, and hosting a dying god held in stasis known only as the Traveler, Master Chief is selected to communicate with it by the Traveler's request. It tells him that he shall be the first of its great army, and makes him the first Titan of the Milky Way (Destiny)[4] . This new Chief gains all the regenerative and holy properties of being a Guardian, including even greater physical strength and stamina. As well as the ability to resurrect himself as long as he doesn't die in places of great Darkness.

Lastly, the Librarian's genetic unlocking of Master Chief on Requiem proved to have more effects than she had intended. His DNA, through some fuckery of Forerunner scientist gradually turned him into the first SPARTAN-Witcher[5] hyrbrid, and through what felt like memories that were implanted into his head, John-117 discovered himself able to perform basic magic in the form of sigils and yet an even higher increase in reaction time and strength in addition to all but total immunity to poisons.""
****
That was the last thread I made. But just for fun, let's also give him the Captain America Super Soldier Serum and say that it stacks additively with his SPARTAN augmentations. In addition, he has been given the cybernatic augmentations from [Deus Ex Human Revolution](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq5KWLqUewc&amp;t=3m20s), but made of Forerunner-grade alloys and Hard Light to keep from degrading in combat. It is powered by both the nanosuit and MJOLNIR's micro-fusion reactor, providing energy that can sustain all systems indefinitely for up to a week. After that, it will rely primarily on the nanosuit's power generators. Assume that the augments only change the exterior of his skin and much of his body is still made up of the significantly stronger biologically upgraded components.

Now that we've established our hilariously overpowered soldier in question who's now a powerful psi-operative, armed with magics of both the Traveler and sigils, and has a more powerful variant of MJOLNIR now that it's been buffed with the Nanosuit 2, how would he fare in these situations?

Assume Chief keeps the gear he is given per round. Ex, first fight he gets a pistol. Second fight he gets a rifle. By the third fight he now has a pistol and a rifle.

**I HAVE EDITED SOME OF THE ROUNDS SINCE I HORRIBLY MISJUDGED THE COMBATANTS. OOPSIES, WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.**

****
The defenders of Helms Deep have been replaced entirely with Master Chief, who must destroy all hostile Orcs to win. He is armed only with his Hard Light blades from the Deus Ex augments.

****
The battle of Geonosis has begun, but more than half of the entire Jedi army's force of clones has vanished! Instead, a single LAAT transport drops off a solder in olive drab power armor who assumes control of the clone forces. With his reduced force, can the Chief win the battle and destroy the droids and their factories? Chief is now armed with [Hard Light from Destiny.](http://destiny.wikia.com/wiki/Hard_Light) and can synthesize his own ammunition, albeit slowly.
****
A squad of tactical Space Marines of the Blood Angels chapter have decided to try and take down Ultimate Chief. Assuming they're battling in the [domed ruins of Old New York \(Crysis 3\)](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111120618/3125286-9923905175-84886.jpg), who would win the battle? Chief is now given an energy sword with unlimited charges in addition to a Crysis SCAR. The SCAR fires hypersonic SABOT darts, and the darts have been made of adamantium. Ammunition is generated by his upgraded suit's fabricators, albeit slowly.

EDIT: Chief is given both a Forerunner Z-250 Hard Light Rifle as well as the Binary Rifle. The lore versions, not the in game ones from Halo 4.

****
Chief has been transported to Azeroth at the time of the Lich King. Can he successfully destroy the necromancer and his army, alone? Assume Chief being a Guardian of the Traveler is enough to shield him from magic to a degree. Chief is armed with [Dawnbreaker](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dawnbreaker), the legendary sword of Meridia (Elder Scrolls).

EDIT: Chief is now equipped with Captain America's Vibranium Shield and given Thor's Mjolnir.
***
Chief has been sent to Subsector Aurelia at the time of the events of Dawn of War: Retribution. Assuming he gets a ship to transport him around the sector, can he successfully prevent the Exterminatus of the sector, and failing that, can he destroy Azariah Kyras and the Chaos forces in the region?

EDIT: Chief has been turned into an Alpha-level psyker on top of all his other abilities, and thanks to being a Guardian and protected by the Traveler's Light, Corruption has no effect on him and Chaos-based enemies are weaker in his presence.

It's not even going to be that elaborate. We're going to go shopping for a few hours while blasting Ke$ha and Taylor Swift, then we're gonna go back to my house so they can play Life is Strange on my computer since they don't have it and they love the game. Also Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars, which is basically the predecessor for Rocket league and on the Playstation 3 for those wondering. I even went and bought kernels of popcorn instead of microwavable packets just because of the atmosphere they provide.

And frankly, I'm just so happy about it. Last year I had some of the easiest classes I could have taken, and a whole lot of other things that helped me through my year, but I was depressed. Most days I'd either come into class with my head held low and didn't utter a sound or I'd just put on a fake smile and pretend everything was alright. I never did know if it fooled my friends.

Anyways, the one thing that kept me going was this class I had where I got to essentially chill for half an hour since we got our work done immediately, and other people who had the class also got to visit us and just in general shoot the shit and hang out. There weren't many of us, so be became fast friends, and even though they only somewhat realized something was wrong with me whenever I had one of my episodes, they didn't shy away or ignore me. They always did little things that brightened my day. On the day I believed my life couldn't get any worse I got a hug and some candy and was told that hopefully my day would get better. Another guy bought me lunch even though I'd brought me own, just as a gesture of kindness.

I'm feeling much better this year, and it's pretty much entirely thanks to them. I'm still uncertain about my future, and uneasy about what's coming but I'm no longer so dreadful about it. I know that life's worth living even if its for the simplest of things, like just spending time with the people you care about and make you happy. Because they do the same for you and it's just fun, and isn't that what we should all be trying to have in our lives?

And for some reason that none of them can explain, they all feel this inherent desire to work with each other.

Also they've been teleported into a spacious armory-like room that exists outside of their universe, with numbered doors leading to different fights.

And then they got an update from their Pip boys. A new quest! Defeat all hostiles behind each door. As it is within every one of their completionist natures, they all immediately aspire to take down whatever lies behind the doors.

They are all maxed out to what is possible within the game, and have every item. They are allowed to share items, strategy, basically anything that they have with each other.

Each of them are given 20 of each medical drug in the game [stimpaks for insta-heals, Med-X for painkillers, radaway, psycho (basically fake adrenaline), ect.]

All ammunition with be replenished, armor repaired, and wounds healed the second they win their fight. As long as even one of them survives, they are all brought back from the dead in perfect condition for the next fight.

Assume all opponents are aware that *something* is going to try and kill them soon, but they don't know what unless otherwise stated. (Example, round 3).

Assume that game mechanics kinda sorta apply but within reason. For example, the end-game Courier is heavily cybernetically augmented, to the point where getting shot in the head with small handguns or low caliber assault rifles basically does nothing. Obviously regardless of natural durability, the Courier probably couldn't survive getting shot in the head with say, a .50 cal in real life, but if armored and with all the resiliency perks and whatnot, getting hit by one anywhere else would be survivable.

They must fight to the death or otherwise incapacitate their opponent. Where on this ladder would they get stopped?

Round 1: An abandoned [UNSC Forward Unto Dawn](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/halofanon/images/0/0a/UNSC_Forward_Unto_Dawn_%28FFV-22201%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120304213743), prior to being sawn in half.

Unarmored Master Chief plus four marines and two ODSTs. They all get their standard loadout of assault rifles, pistols, and grenades.
****
Round 2: They must clear the entirety of the Dead Space campaigns across all three games. They are allowed to use the shops to get armor and weapons along with other such things. Nothing in the DS universe has changed, except for the fact that they replace Isaac.
****
Round 3: [Gotham City](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/batman/images/3/32/BatmanArkhamKnightGothamCity.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140530010522)

Batman. He is not aware that they are even in the city, and they are given a quest marker leading to him. He is armored and has his standard gear. Use N52 Batman. Bonus points for discussing what would happen if he had full knowledge that four people were going to try and kill him that day.
****
Upon beating round 3, all of them are given the cybernetics that the Courier received from the NV Medical Clinic as well as Big MT Research center. This makes them all stronger, harder to kill, extremely resilient to poisons, and better all around in every way, including slow but always active passive health regeneration.

Round 4: A [hilly field somewhere in the Midwestern US](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Iowa_SIDP.jpg)

[Armored Master Chief](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/124784/3645717-7786087453-Halo-.jpg) plus two Spartan IVs. The IVs get an assault rifle and pistol. Chief is allowed a Spartan Laser and Railgun.
****
Round 5: Manhattan, NYC.

Captain America, Black Widow, and Hawkeye.
****
Round 6: S.H.I.E.L.D. [Helicarrier.](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/3/3f/Helicarrier_aft.png/revision/latest?cb=20150318054757)

They must fight all the bosses from their games. Including the 5 Super Mutant Behemoths from Fallout 3, every Legendary animal from New Vegas such as the [legendary Deathclaw](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/4/46/Rawr.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120710202522), and of course the end-campaign bosses like Lanius and [Frank Horrigan](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/1/1a/FO02_NPC_Frank_Horrigan.png/revision/latest?cb=20100811232531).
****
BONUS ROUND: They are all empowered to have 10 in every SPECIAL stat, maxed skills, and are allowed to have every single perk from all the games. All of them.
