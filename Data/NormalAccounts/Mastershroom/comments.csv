As for cases, it's generally pretty safe to pick based on looks. Larger cases (full tower) will obviously have more room, which gives you more cooling options, but there's nothing wrong with a smaller mid tower. Noise levels will be affected by your fans, everything from the case fans to the fans in your graphics card cooler and CPU heatsink.

For the most part, your second monitor will have negligible performance impact.

&gt;* Do you have previous moderation experience?:

Not on reddit, but I was a moderator of the FileFront Gaming Forums (gamingforums.com) for several years. It kinda died off in its last few years of life, but in its peak it was one of the biggest gaming discussion sites around. 
&gt;* How long have you been playing The Old Republic?:

I started a couple of months after launch. A few real-life friends convinced me to join them, and then they all quit within a couple of months lol. But I found new friends in the game and stuck around.

I admit I haven't been playing so much lately (my guild disbanded around the release of SoR, and since KotFE I've basically been logging in once a month to play the chapters and that's about it), but I'm hoping KotET will be what the game needs. Time will tell!
&gt;* Are you affiliated with other The Old Republic related websites, including Twitch and YouTube channels?:

Nope!
&gt;* Why you want to be a mod?:

This subreddit has helped me out a lot over the years with lots of good information, not to mention interesting discussion. I'd like to offer my services as a way to give back. And, as I've never modded a subreddit before, I'd like to gain some experience in that area.
&gt;* One idea that you have to help the community/improve the subreddit:

I've always thought the official subreddit guild should exist across the game, not just on Shadowlands. I'm sure there are plenty of us from /r/SWTOR on Harbinger, for example, why not have an affiliate branch of Jeddit there?

As for the subreddit itself, I'm not sure. I think the relative lack of activity here relates directly to the relative stagnation of the game. That said, maybe we could do daily themed sticky threads. /r/DestinyTheGame has Mentor Monday threads, for example, sorted by New by default and all top-level comments are questions about anything in the game, and more experienced players answer the questions.

High temperatures can actually cause the workpiece to get discolored and change other physical properties while it's being cut, and leads to shorter tool life.

Think of how a handheld drill or drill press usually works. The drill spins at a high speed, and gets fed into stationary material. With a lathe, it's the same overall relative motion, just the drill is stationary and the material rotates. 

And yes, the tool is much harder than the material it cuts. Carbide and high-speed steel are common cutting tool materials, and this part is made of brass, which is pretty soft as far as metals go.

186,"I think Bungie could benefit greatly by taking a page out of Blizzard's book with regards to RNG loot boxes: in Overwatch, you can buy Loot Crates, which are basically the equivalent of Treasures in Destiny; they give you randomly selected cosmetic items, including character skins, voice lines, emotes and so on.

Like in Destiny, you can get duplicates of items you already have in Overwatch crates. However, when this happens, you gain currency that you can then use to buy any specific cosmetic item you wish for any character. This currency sometimes drops from crates on its own as well, in greater amounts. Higher-quality skins cost more currency, but it's nice knowing that eventually you can buy anything that you'd been hoping for but didn't get from the crates themselves.

Overwatch has a Halloween event going on right now with limited-availability cosmetics just like Destiny, but where FotL has me not really wanting to play much this week once I've finished the quests, I'm ranking up in Overwatch as fast as I can and buying some crates.

276,"Raids are one of the sources for top level gear, and in my opinion by far the most fun part of Destiny. If you're not into playing with complete randos, check out the100.io, it basically puts you in a more or less consistent pool of 100 people. Small enough to actually form a close community, but large enough that you'll almost always have enough people online for any activity. Plus it matches you with a group based on your time zone, times of day that you're on and other stuff.

As far as solo content, you can do all the story and Strike missions and everything in Crucible except for Trials of Osiris (3v3 Elimination mode, requires a full Fireteam of 3 to enter). The Nightfall strikes also require a group, but they're just harder versions of the strikes that you can play regularly. The raids are the only PvE content that you need a team for.

Edit - to answer your question about gear, I'd say raids are the most reliable source of highest level gear, and they have a unique set of weapons and armor, but you can technically reach the same level of gear with rewards from Iron Banner, Trials (though that requires a 3 man team) and exotic engram decryption.",2016-10-16 08:09:02+00:00,d8u3yui,3.0,t1_d8u3sqr,571.0,DestinyTheGame

1. Assume every gun is loaded. If you do this, you'll never have reason to be careless with it.

2. Finger off the trigger until you are ready to fire. The trigger is what makes a firearm go bang, so if your finger is nowhere near it, you won't negligently fire.

3. Only aim at what you intend to destroy/kill. If you don't want to put holes through it (in the case of an object) or end its life (in the case of a person or animal), then don't point the gun at it.

4. Always be aware of your target and what is beyond it.

316,"If you ever played the Court of Oryx during the Taken King, it's similar to that. You use an item that triggers a public encounter. The item is called a SIVA Offering, and you can have one at a time in your Consumables inventory. There are two details to be aware of for each offering: the quality and the enemy type. Quality is simple - Fused offerings are green, Enhanced are blue, and Perfected are purple.

Each offering also lists what enemy type it spawns in its description. Basically, any Fallen enemy is fair game: Dregs, Vandals, Captains, Shanks and Servitors.

Once you use your Offering on the terminal in the entrance room to the Forge, you have a couple of seconds to enter the arena before the door seals up. Once the event starts, enemies will start coming out of the various doors in the arena. Kill them. At around 50% of enemy squads cleared, Ghost will say something like ""the Fallen are up to something"", and one of the big spherical doors will open to reveal a SIVA shrine-looking thing. Shoot that, and another one will open soon afterwards to spawn an Iron Battleaxe. This is optional, but awesome.

Once you get 100% of squads cleared, the boss will spawn in one of the spherical chambers. Kill them, and you win the encounter.

If you're the only one in the arena, stick to the green and blue offerings; the purple ones are quite difficult even with a full team. And if you die while you're the only one there, you won't have enough time to spawn and get back in before the event cancels.

If you walk into the Forge when an event is already started, the door will be blocked off, but you can use a Splicer Key to open it and join.",2016-10-10 13:44:20+00:00,d8ltxlx,2.0,t1_d8ltn9a,515.0,DestinyTheGame

335,"&gt;3. I believe To legally buy a gun at a gun store in the United States, you have to go though a firearm course. At least in Georgia. I'm not sure if that applies to gun shows though. You also have to go through a Criminal background test, and there is a mandatory waiting period. I honestly think that a mental health aspect should be added to the background check, but that's my personal opinion. Some people with mental disabilities should not be allowed around a gun. I'm as Pro-Second Amendment as they come, but mental health should be a factor in buying a gun. 

The mandatory course before being able to buy and the waiting period are local things; the only federal requirement is passing the NICS check. When I bought my first gun in Ohio, I had never taken a course, I just walked into the store, filled out the paperwork and walked out with my new gun in about 20 minutes. 

As for mental health, you already can't buy one if you've been declared mentally incompetent by a court. Anything beyond that would be a pretty huge HIPAA violation. In any case, dealers can refuse a sale if they suspect their customer is unstable or has malicious plans. ",2016-10-08 10:26:06+00:00,d8j2d8t,8.0,t1_d8itdfu,25042.0,funny

I'm not butthurt, nor am I jumping on any bandwagons, but I do think hand cannons are unnecessarily frustrating to use. I was a big fan of hand cannons in Year 1, and not just the Thorn/TLW meta. Legendary HCs were largely outclassed by those two, but on their own, they felt great to use.

357,"Yep, that's what's happening. Basically, when you fire, there is a narrow cone of possible bullet deviation from the true center line of your aim. For most weapons this is more or less negligible unless you're shooting something way outside your intended range, or in the case of auto rifles or machine guns, you're shooting so many rounds that it doesn't really matter if some go a tad off center. Hand Cannons are the most severe example of this accuracy cone; as you say, shots that ""feel"" like they should land go completely wild. And there is an additional mechanic called bloom, in which the more shots you fire in a row rapidly, the wider that cone of accuracy gets until you reset it by not firing for a short time.

It's supposed to encourage pacing your shots and not overextending the range of your weapon, but I think the common opinion is that it's just frustrating and makes hand cannons unreliable as a whole.",2016-10-07 16:34:25+00:00,d8i1z04,5.0,t1_d8hsa9o,13874.0,DestinyTheGame

A Z170 motherboard and i5-6600K is basically the gold standard if you want to overclock, otherwise a 6600 or 6500 (non-K) and B150/H110 board, plus DDR4 memory. As for graphics, as far as NVIDIA, a GTX 1060 if you're on a tight budget, 1070 is arguably the best balance of price and performance, and 1080 if you want the absolute highest performance single card, but you probably won't even take full advantage of it unless you're running 1440p or 4k resolution.

Lower resolutions are easier to run, so the only way a monitor would be a limiting factor for performance is if it's too high a resolution for the computer's specs (e.g. a 4k monitor on a single GTX 1060).

692,"For Titans, **Armamentarium** is probably the most popular. Having a second grenade is pretty much always useful. **Twilight Garrison** is fun and can let you dodge supers and rockets, but not as popular since the nerf.

If you play Striker, the **Helm of Inmost Light** gives you two of the better subclass perks for your Fist of Havoc. If you prefer to Shoulder Charge, the **Mk. 44 Stand Asides** keep its window of availability open for 12 seconds instead of 5, and you can turn faster while sprinting.

For Defender Titans, **Helm of Saint-14** makes your bubble blind any enemy that steps inside it, and the **No Backup Plans** increase the duration of your Force Barrier. If you combine NBP with the Relentless perk in your subclass tree and Tier 5 Strength, you will have a new Force Barrier charge as soon as your current Barrier expires.

---

For Hunters, the **Bones of Eao** are the most common subclass-neutral exotic. They give you an extra jump, which will turn any Double Jump ability into a Triple Jump, and turns Triple Jump into a Quad Jump. It does not affect Blink, however. **Sealed Ahamkara Grasps** give you a second melee ability charge, which is generally useful as well. **Knucklehead Radar** gives you the Third Eye perk with any primary. Obviously useless if you use MIDA or any other primary that actually has the perk.

On to subclass specifics: for Nightstalker, the **Graviton Forfeit** is almost a no-brainer. It gives you Shadestep, one of the Nighstalker's most powerful and game changing abilities, for free, so you can pair it with Keen Scout for increased radar resolution.

If you prefer Bladedancer, the **ATS/8 Tarantella** reduces the cooldown of your super and Blink Strike and gives you some Arc damage protection in PvE. **Mask of the Third Man** makes your super last a little bit longer, I think one or two extra swipes in most cases.

Gunslingers have the **Achlyophage Symbiote**, which gives you 4 Golden Gun shots instead of 3, and on the flip side of that spectrum, the **Celestial Nighthawk**, which gives you only one shot, but that shot does 6x damage. For obvious reasons the Nighthawk is really only useful in PvE. There's also the **Young Ahamkara's Spine**, which gives you a second Tripmine and increases the Tripmine's detonation timer to 45 seconds, but this has fallen out of favor somewhat since the Tripmine nerfs.

---

Warlocks: the **Claws of Ahamkara** give you a second melee charge, straight up useful, really the only neutral exotic worth mentioning.

Sunsingers have a few options. **Sunbreakers** (no, not the Titan subclass) increase the duration of your Solar grenade and give you a second charge. **Heart of the Praxic Fire** shortens cooldowns while in Radiance, but it's not as useful these days since the cooldowns are so short already. **Starfire Protocol** gives you a second Fusion Grenade, decent choice if you're running those. 

Voidwalkers have the **Obsidian Mind**, which allows Nova Bomb to feed itself; the more kills you get with one Bomb, the more Super energy you get back immediately for your next Bomb. **Nothing Manacles** give you a second Scatter Grenade, and allows the submunitions to track nearby targets. **Voidfang Vestments** do the same for Axion Bolts; each one gains an additional seeker.

For Stormcallers, **Impossible Machines** are the only specific choice, and they're a good one. Free Landfall perk, which frees you up to choose Ionic Blink.

---

All three classes have another universal exotic that's pretty good in certain situations; for Titans and Hunters it's called the **Crest of Alpha Lupi**, and for Warlocks it's **Light Beyond Nemesis**.

Anyway, part of my reason for upgrading is appearance, as silly as that may seem to some of you. The Blackwidow is all black plastic and blue LEDs, which fit perfectly with my old black case and all its blue LED fans, but my new case is the [NZXT Phantom in white with red trim](http://i.imgur.com/DGrCV4M.jpg) and red LED fans. So, red LED backlighting is a must, and ideally white for the ""main"" color, though I could do black as well. I thought about the new version of the Blackwidow with Chroma lighting, but it seems they've stopped using the original Cherry switches and now they have their own brand of lower quality switches.

768,"In very broad terms, smaller cases are easier to transport and fit in more places, and tend to be less expensive, at the cost of being more limited in terms of what you can fit into them. As you go up in size, you'll find more features and part compatibility, obviously at the expense of additional bulk and financial cost.

Most cases will fall into a ""tower"" category, usually split into mini towers, mid towers, full towers and ultra towers. There's no universal standard for what defines each one, but in general:

* Mini tower - takes mATX motherboards, single GPU, probably not going to fit a big-ass CPU heatsink. I wouldn't want to try a non-modular PSU with one of these, though I've never owned one, to be fair. Typically not a whole lot of options for fans beyond a single rear exhaust and front intake, maybe top exhaust.
* Mid tower - most popular size, can usually take mATX or regular ATX boards and can comfortably fit one GPU, maybe two, but it will get cozy. Not a whole lot of room to spare, but you can put a pretty full-featured build together with a bit of careful cable management. My last two PCs were built with mid tower cases, one with an mATX board and one with regular ATX, and both with pretty bulky air coolers and a single big GPU. 
* Full tower - Not many more features than a mid tower, but a good amount of room to work with. My current case is a full tower (NZXT Phantom), and it's by far my favorite. Plenty of room for a full ATX or larger board and lots of cooling options. My Phantom, for example, has mounts for two 200mm fans on top, a 120mm in the back, a 140mm up front, and two 120mm and a 200mm on the left side panel. Plenty of room for two big graphics cards.
* I've never used an ultra tower, but it seems like something you'd want for super elaborate custom watercooling setups with two or three GPUs.

And then there are non-tower formats like HTPC or LAN boxes, typically using mini ITX motherboards, and are generally made to be compact or portable rather than versatile.

Linus has a pretty good breakdown of case designs here: [edit - /u/Sofusbofus beat me to it lol]

**tl;dr - smaller cases are more portable and (usually) cheaper, but with more limited options for hardware and cooling. Bigger ones can fit whatever you want, but tend to be unwieldy if you move your PC around a lot, although there are full towers with built in carrying handles if that's your thing.

892,"&gt;So I don't know the lingo, names - no idea what T12 Gear means for example -

Tier 12 refers to the number of stat tiers you can have with your gear. Intellect, Strength and Discipline each have 5 tiers you can hit, based on how many points of each of those stats your gear has. If you're over level 300, pretty much any gear will capable of Tier 10, i.e. you might have tier 5 Intellect, tier 5 Strength and no Discipline, or a mix of all three. 5/5/0 splits are most common, but you could do 4/3/3 or something if you want. Just depends on what stats you have. 

Half decent gear is capable of Tier 11, so you might have 5/5/1 for example. Only the best rolled gear can give you enough stat points for Tier 12 at this point, and frankly I wouldn't worry about it. Tier 10 is plenty. ",2016-08-02 01:24:34+00:00,d60fmjj,2.0,t1_d608v9v,9823.0,DestinyTheGame

895,"Challenge isn't really a separate ""mode""; you can do the weekly challenge in either the normal or hard mode raid. Basically, the challenge just requires you to follow a few extra rules during certain boss fights.

For the Warpriest Challenge, the only condition is that you cannot have the same player hold the Aura twice. If someone accidentally picks up the Aura a second time, or if an Aura holder dies and it passes to someone who has already had it, might as well wipe the fight and start again. Very easy, since most groups will kill the Warpriest in no more than 3 Auras.

To complete the Golgoroth Challenge, every player has to take Golgoroth's Gaze in each damage phase. The easiest way to do this is to stick with the 1-orb strategy using the closest left-side orb, and when the original Gaze holder calls out 10 seconds left, one person will run out of the puddle and position himself behind Golgoroth, and shoot his back to take the Gaze when there are 1 or 2 seconds left. The new Gaze holder jumps across the bridge and circles the arena counterclockwise while everyone else leaves the puddle and lines up by the bridge. By the time the second Gaze holder reaches the front left, Golgoroth's back should be open again and in position for the third Gaze holder to shoot him and take it. Just repeat that until everyone has taken the Gaze, and the last person just runs around in circles until it expires. This must be done for every damage phase except for the phase where Golgoroth dies.

The Oryx challenge requires you to detonate all 16 Corrupted Lights in one phase rather than 4 phases of 4 Lights. Many groups consider this easier even when it's not the weekly Challenge, because you're not risking people failing to get back to the Aura in time for 4 rounds in a row. This method does require the two floaters to kill the Ogres very quickly, as the Corrupted Lights must be dropped more or less on top of each other in order for each person to detonate 4 at once in the final phase. Also, there is no bombardment phase if you don't detonate after the first phase; you just go straight into Thunderdome phase.

tl;dr - the Challenges are just an extra rule for the three boss fights, independent of Normal vs. Hard mode.",2016-08-02 01:05:26+00:00,d60eter,2.0,t1_d60cqvs,2982.0,DestinyTheGame

Correct. If you have the right perks selected plus Unstoppable (from the actual Striker tree, not the helmet), your Armor bar should be completely filled up, and an Arc Armor chest piece will give you one more Armor point in top of that, making you tied with Ram Warlocks for highest Armor in the game.

Plus there were two Void primaries, one being a low impact hand cannon, and the other a bullet hose auto rifle before those were any good.

And your melee cooldown will be 25 seconds as well, so you can have that overshield up pretty much constantly.

Obviously that's much easier to pull off in PvE than Crucible, but I've had some stupidly good Crucible matches running this build. You also get Suppressor grenades, which will shut down any roaming super (it's a little iffy against Arc Blade due to a bug with that super), and even without shutting down a super, it will prevent them from using their jump ability or grenades. Also, your bubble can make you nearly invincible against anyone who challenges you in your Thunderdome with Armor of Light, give you and your team an overshield every time you pass through the bubble (Blessing of Light), or boost weapon damage, making a lot of sniper rifles one-hit bodyshot kills (Weapons of Light).

3. For PvE, faster firing is generally better. I believe the New Monarchy shotgun has Full Auto on the vendor roll. Invective and Fourth Horseman are good for exotics.

There's a quest where you have to complete 5 Strikes, 5 Heroic Strikes and a Nightfall that rewards you with a god-rolled Conspiracy Theory-D, which is the highest impact and with perks that max out the range.

Also on mobile right now, sorry :p

&gt;
2.) I've had a few legendary engram drops but when I go to Variks to purchase things that require a leg engram it will not let me purchase. Even with multiple leg engrams on my character, what am I doing wrong to not be able to purchase? He is high enough rank and I have plenty of legendary marks as well. 

You sure they're for the right slot? I believe they have to be legendary class item engrams, not just any legendary. 

&gt;
3.) the last quest I need to complete on planets is the KF raid. I can only get my light to a max of 307 currently, what or where should I be farming to get higher light drops? I've been playing crucible a ton this week and see some decent LL drops but nothing to advance or infuse with. I'd like to get to 320 before attempting KF. I am a 95% solo player so if it's possible to up my LL solo awesome but if not, what should I be running multiplayer-wise?

King's Fall normal mode can be done at 290, so you're fine. You could probably do HM just fine as well. As far as getting infusion fuel, rank up your Crucible, Vanguard and faction ranks. Each rank up gives you a package with random gear that can go up to 330. Also, exotic engrams from 3oC can decrypt up to 335. Challenge of the Elders gives you an armor piece and weapon every week for the Sigil, and random Ghost shell and class item drops after each game. 

&gt;4.) What quests are there for me that lead to exotics as rewards? Currently the only one I have in quest is for the exotic sword. 

There's a Reef quest that rewards you with Boolean Gemini, a Gunsmith quest for each class at rank 3 for a class exclusive exotic primary and another one for Sleeper Simulant when you find all the DVALIN fusion relics. When Lost To Light is the daily Heroic, you can get Black Spindle, and with Paradox as the daily you can start the quest for No Time To Explain. 

&gt;5.) in crucible what all is affected by ""level advantage disabled"" is this only player level/light level? Or does that also mean I could bring a crappy 37 LL gun into the crucible and its weighted up to an even keel?

Yup, neither your level nor your gear levels matter. 

&gt;6.) last question I think, could someone explain all the lingo in this reddit? I've finally figured out SGA = super good advice and SBMM = skill based match making. But what about CBMM? And any other abbreviations used here. I have a decent understanding of what sweaty/sweats are but a lot of the lingo here I am just not understanding. 

CBMM = connection based matchmaking, i.e. it prioritizes low latency over even ranking match ups. 

&gt;Last edit: what is the best way to level Eris Morn? The only thing I've found to level her is running runes in the dreadnought. I haven't noticed anything else I do that increases the Crota rep. Same goes for the queen lady in reef and house of judgement. I have no idea how to level those two. 

You get Eris rep for running Crota's End. You can get Queen's rep by handing in Etheric Light. ",2016-05-24 04:34:10+00:00,d3hcr8d,2.0,t1_d3h9trg,5409.0,DestinyTheGame

&gt;Thoughts?

It depends entirely on the roll you get with it. It can be really good, or instant dismantle. Yours has a little less stability than I'd like if you choose Explosive Rounds over Braced Frame, but ultimately you should use what you like and what you do well with. 

Treads is a mid-impact scout, so it's got a fairly slow time to kill (1 second with 4 crit shots), though it can be decent for counter sniping. It's not very popular because a lot of people have the original god-roll Hung Jury, which is the same archetype, but comes with maximum stability, Firefly and Triple Tap. The Gunsmith's SUROS DIS-43 can also roll very nicely with top stability and Full Auto. ",2016-05-24 00:19:42+00:00,d3h3cr6,2.0,t1_d3h31ze,471.0,DestinyTheGame

1443,"The Arminius is the fastest firing, lowest impact auto rifle type, which is very powerful right now. It can roll Counterbalance and Braced Frame, which give it a lot of stability and controllable recoil, making it a good competitor to the Doctrine of Passing that's so popular.

I'd skip the Zarinaea, that's a mid-impact/mid-RoF type and there are a million of those and they aren't that competitive anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

For scouts, the Cocytus is the highest impact, slowest firing scout type. It can kill in 3 headshots in Crucible if your aim is good, and in PvE it's popular because it can one-shot Acolytes in King's Fall, which the other scout archetypes can't do. It can also roll the same perks as the notorious original Hung Jury vendor roll, with Firefly and Triple Tap.

The DIS-47 is the opposite; fast firing and low impact. It can have maximum stability, and can roll with Full Auto, essentially turning it into a relatively slow firing, hard-hitting auto rifle. I have one with max stability and no Full Auto, and it's still very nice, but it will take at least 5 shots to kill in Crucible, and a few shots to kill most adds in PvE.",2016-05-22 04:47:13+00:00,d3ew914,1.0,t3_4kgtfb,6887.0,DestinyTheGame

1501,"Definitely worth it. By far the most reliable way to get exotics.

Basically, buy as many 3oC as you want/can afford. Use one (just highlight it in your inventory and hold Square (PS) or X (Xbox). This will give you a buff called Exotic Particles that you can see on your character menu.

While that buff is active, any Crucible match you finish or any Ultra you kill has a chance to drop an Exotic Engram. It's completely random what slot engram you get.

The Exotic Particles buff never expires, so don't worry about logging off after popping a 3oC. The buff is removed when you either kill an Ultra or finish a Crucible match, whether or not you got an exotic from it.

Bungie hasn't given us an official number, but the general consensus is to wait about 10 minutes between uses, as there is a cooldown. Generally, using one 3oC at the beginning of each consecutive Strike or Crucible match is pretty reasonable as long as you're not doing speed runs.

The effect also increases the chance of an exotic the more 3oC you use in a row without a drop. The average seems to be around one exotic every 10 Three of Coins used.

Also, it's possible to get really lucky and have two Exotic Engrams drop from the same kill or match completion.

1520,"&gt;I really want to go for Thorn, eventually, although I understand that it's only available from Legacy Engrams, which seems like a bit of a tough row to hoe.

Thorn is neat, but it's stuck at Year 1 levels and probably will stay that way forever. I highly recommend you check out The Last Word, which you can also get from Legacy engrams and then buy the Year 2 version, or you can get the Y2 version from a regular Primary Exotic engram. It doesn't hit quite as hard per shot as Thorn and there's no burn, but it's the fastest firing HC in the game. If slow and hard hitting is more your style, there's Hawkmoon and The First Curse, plus a few legendaries with potential for good rolls (Eyasluna comes to mind).

&gt;Given my proclivity for hc's, should I just bite the bullet and roll a Hunter?

Destiny takes a lot of cues from traditional MMOs, but one thing it does differently is let you use any weapon with any class. Hand Cannons aren't ""meant"" for Hunters any more than they are for Warlocks or Titans.

&gt;And when should I start seeing drops/rewards for better hc's? So far I've only been getting Mavericks with 3-shot magazines, which is just not viable.

Until you hit level 40, basically all you're going to get is shitty blue guns. Once you get to 40, you'll start seeing some proper loot, and you'll be able to buy vendor weapons with Legendary Marks, and exotics with Strange Coins.

&gt;Also, is there any point in giving the Crucible a shot before I hit the level cap and am all legendary-and-exotic'd out?

Absolutely. Regular Crucible is level-balanced, so a level 1 and a level 40 using the same gun will do the same damage per shot. The only disadvantages you'll have are your lack of perks. The only Crucible modes where character and gear level factor into it are Iron Banner (week-long event once a month, 6v6 modes) and Trials of Osiris (every weekend, 3v3 Elimination). Iron Banner is more casual and you can realistically do well at 300 Light, which is pretty easy these days. Trials, I wouldn't mess with until you're 320 at least, it's quite competitive.

&gt;Seems like you guys have a really cool community here, by the way - all sorts of fantastic info for new players :)

Your Revelator actually looks pretty solid, with Rangefinder and Hammer Forged. The rest of your primaries aren't really anything to write home about, but keep whatever feels good to you rather than worrying about getting god-tier rolls. if you want a good pulse rifle, the vendor Hawksaw is top notch right now. 

The Havoc Pigeon is pretty decent. It does the highest damage per shot (very slightly) of all Y2 sidearms, and Crowd Control meshes nicely with that. Spray &amp; Play should make reloading lightning fast as long as you dump your whole mag first. 

Your first 1kYS is actually really good. Shortgaze, Hidden Hand and Quickdraw is an awesome combination. 

For your question about autos and shotguns, you want to prioritize stability on auto rifles. Counterbalance in particular is an excellent perk since it makes your recoil almost entirely vertical rather than bouncing around. Shotguns, you want to maximize range. There's a Vanguard quest you can do involving completing 5 strikes, 5 Heroic strikes and a Nightfall, which offers a god-roll Conspiracy Theory-D shotgun.

1715,"&gt;* Is there a build/talent stacking you should be going for per class? I have a level 16 Warlock and I'm all over the place with Intelligence and Prestige

Not sure what you mean by Intelligence and Prestige, but I assume it's referring to Intellect/Strength/Discipline. Basically, these stats shorten the cooldown of your super, melee, and grenade, respectively. While you're leveling up, don't worry about it too much. When you get to level 40, then you can start trying to put together gear with the stats you want. Currently, at level 40 with high Light level gear, you can max out two of the stats at Tier 5 and the third will have Tier 0 or 1, maybe 2 if you get really good rolls in every slot. 

As for talents, again, not a huge deal while you're still leveling. Experiment with the new talents as you unlock them and see what you like. 

&gt;* Are there guns that benefit certain classes? E.g. Is a shotgun better for a Titan? Scout rifle for a Warlock?

Not really. Destiny makes it pretty easy to use whatever weapons you like in whatever class you like. 

&gt;* Is there an easy way to level up the different builds other then re-doing story missions? Sunsinger for Warlock as opposed to the one you start with

Bounties are good sources of XP for subclasses. Just make sure you have your unleveled subclass equipped when you complete the bounties. 

&gt;* What are Orbs you generate? What do they do for you?

You create orbs when you get kills with your super ability. You can't see your own orbs, but your teammates can pick them up to gain super energy. And when your teammates use their supers, you can pick up their orbs, which look like glowing white and blue balls in the ground. Each orb gives around 5 to 10% of your super bar, depending on how the orb was created and how many you've used recently. ",2016-04-25 21:42:16+00:00,d2h3ptp,2.0,t1_d2h2jvi,1630.0,DestinyTheGame

1743,"1) You're exactly right. The same gun can be absolute crap or god-tier depending entirely on the perks that you get with it. Completely disregarding all perks, every one of the same gun has the same base stats.

2) I don't have a link handy, but DestinyDB or PlanetDestiny's database might have minimum/maximum stat rolls. Also, certain exotic armors can only have certain stat profiles (ex. the Immolation Fists will always have Strength, so you can never get an Int/Dis roll on them)

3) They also have Int/Dis/Str stats, which might affect your ability to max out stats; in most cases you'll want to have two of your stats at Tier 5. But otherwise, no, it's just another factor in calculating your Light. Having one for each material is nice, but not really necessary.

4) Equipping non-maxed gear in every slot to dismantle for more Motes later is technically the ideal thing to do when you're burning Motes to level up gear, but to be honest I don't bother most of the time. I only burn motes when I have a specific weapon I want to max out quickly, because weapons take far fewer Motes to fill with XP compared to Ghosts, armor or Artifacts.

You'll get the same amount of XP in a given slot regardless of whether you've also equipped other non-maxed gear, so it doesn't ""spread out"" the XP or anything like that. For example, with made up numbers, if you only have a non-maxed heavy, one Mote will give you 50 XP to your heavy. If you have a non-maxed Heavy and Primary, you'll get 50 XP to your heavy and 50 to your primary.

As for my weekly routine, I have an odd work schedule so I almost entirely play on the weekends.

1936,"I've found farming VIP patrols in the Cosmodrome to be very efficient. VIP patrols (the ones where you kill a level 40 major) give double the Glimmer and reputation of regular patrols, so you'll get 500 Glimmer and 25 Vanguard/12 faction rep.

When you first load the Cosmodrome, the Steppes has three patrol beacons. If any of those are a VIP mission (the star inside a circle), grab it and through Dock 13 to the Divide, and into the Breach. Kill your target and walk back out into the Divide. If there's a VIP mission there, grab it and turn right back around into the Breach. After that, continue into the Rocketyard. If there are any VIP patrols here, your target will be in the Refinery.

Rinse and repeat. Once you've done all the VIP missions in those areas or get to the Rocketyard and find that there aren't any, just return to orbit and go right back to the Cosmodrome for a fresh set of patrols. A full loop of Steppes &gt; Divide &gt; Rocketyard usually has two or three VIP patrols, and takes maybe 10 minutes total for 1,000 to 1,500 Glimmer.

Taken patrols (the skull icon) also give 500 Glimmer and 25/12 rep, but the ones in the Cosmodrome involve killing a pretty spongey boss and take significantly longer if you're running this solo.

Looks like Roll 2 is pretty much everything you could want in a Crucible launcher, minus the shitty ammo stat, but that has nothing to do with perk rolls. Javelin, Verniers, and proximity detonation is the winning combination here.

These have already been posted, but I'll tabulate them.

A couple of pretty solid rolls with good stability, but I'm saving mine until I can get the exact roll that I have on my PDX-41, which is Fitted Stock/Hand-Laid Stock/Counterbalance. Stupidly high stability and straight recoil.

2005,"&gt;Is there a way to get weapons from Prison on Elders at year two light levels? I recently got The Last Word hand cannon from there at 160 light on my second character. 

You got the Year 1 version of that exotic because you were doing a Year 1 activity. In the exotic weapon kiosk in the Vanguard room in the Tower, you can buy the Year 2 version at 280 Light for 150 Legendary Marks. Keep in mind not all Year 1 exotics have a Year 2 version yet, but The Last Word is one that does :) also, the legendary weapons you can get from PoE also currently do not have Y2 versions. 

&gt;Also my first character revived the quest to get The Chaperone (second probably didn't have high enough reputation at 280 light?). When I did the quest I revived randomly to get The Chaperone I got it at 280 light instead of somewhere lower to match The Last Word. 

The Chaperone is a Year 2 weapon only, and is always given at 280 Light regardless of which version of The Last Word you use to get it. ",2016-03-22 04:38:09+00:00,d18smqv,2.0,t1_d18rgnd,2538.0,DestinyTheGame

Next would be the ones from chests; IIRC you get one from your first ""named"" chest, one from the Scent Chest, and one from the chest in the Hall of Souls that damages you. You can survive the damage by holding the relic that spawns in one of the Taken rooms, or by blocking with a sword, or popping a super with damage resistance (basically anything except Golden Gun, Fist of Havoc, Shadowshot or Nova Bomb).

Then there's the ones for beating specific combos of Tier 2 Court of Oryx bosses. If you get a combo you don't need, you can just abandon the fight, wait for the timer to run out, and get your rune back. You have to be the one to summon them in order to get the Fragment.

The hardest ones would be the Tier 3 Court bosses, as there's only one per week, the one from doing a Nightfall on the Dreadnaught (since there's only two possibilities for that), and the raid Fragments.

Here's a thought: you trade your own life for theirs. And to prevent cheesing, killing yourself in this way gives you at least a 10 second revive timer (in non Darkness zones and Crucible). The normal 30 second timer would apply for Nightfalls, NM raids, and no revives in HM raids.

Imagine that in Trials...the other team kills both of your teammates, and as they gang up on you, you pop your super and die as your teammates come back to life.

And that all assumes that your bubble doesn't turn into a death trap from a Fist of Havoc or Nova Bomb or Landfall or Golden Gun or Hammer as soon as you cast it in the first place.

Literally any other auto rifle is better for any situation. Wanna melt someone trying to close on a control point? Use Doctrine of Passing or Arminius. Same high RoF, but with much bigger magazines and potentially good stability depending on perks, and not dependent on how close anyone else is to you.

Want a decent mid-RoF auto? Use Hard Light, which has the same magazine and the maximum possible stability, plus no range dropoff and bouncy rounds. Or Monte Carlo, with great stability and it charges your melee while you're at it. Or Zhalo, with its AoE damage capability and free ammo on double kills.

Currently, the fastest way to level up factions is to donate supplies. You can buy Heavy ammo synths from Xur at three synths for one Strange Coin. You get enough faction rep to rank up by donating 100 Heavy synths, so you can effectively buy a rank for about 33 Strange Coins.

Skullfort is technically meant for Striker Titans since it gives you Transfusion on Storm Fist and Shoulder Charge, but it gives the double melee charge to all Titan subclasses (though it's currently bugged for Defenders and will consume both charges with a single Disintegrate kill).

Empyrean Bellicose is pretty situational and not one of my favorites. It lets you hover in the air for a couple of brief seconds while you aim, and it lets you use up orbs with a full Super to charge melee. Personally I'd rather save orbs exclusively for Super building.

Taikonaut is pretty cool. If you have a blue or purple launcher with Tripod and Grenades &amp; Horseshoes, this helmet will basically turn it into a mini-Truth. Be aware that if you use it with a launcher than already has tracking, though, it actually cancels out and your rocket will not track.

The new subclasses start out with the first grenade, super, and special melee unlocked, but you unlock everything else the same way. It will take pretty much the same amount of time. You might also consider spending $20 on the Collector's Edition add-on that gives you an exotic class item that levels your new subclasses 25% faster, but keep in mind that you won't be able to wear other exotic armor with it, and it's locked at only 170 Light.

For anyone who isn't familiar with Titan skating, here's how you do it: it works with any of the subclasses, you just need Increased Control selected as your Lift perk. While sprinting, jump once, and just before you hit the ground again, quickly activate your Lift in three short bursts. Each burst will give you a bit of forward momentum, and if you keep it up without running into any obstacles, you can build some ludicrous speed. Running Striker with Shoulder Charge also helps by making it easier to change direction quickly, but it's not necessary.

In general, each category of weapon has three tiers of impact and rate of fire. High impact/low RoF, low impact/high RoF, and one that's somewhere in the middle. The other stats tend to vary from one weapon to another within a category, and they can also change with different perk options, depending on what perks the gun drops with. 

For example, Dealbreaker will always be a max impact/min RoF auto rifle, but depending on what perks it has when it drops, it might have maxed stability and low range, or more range with slower reload speed, and so on.

3423,"&gt;Hey! We also had the same thing with our shelter dog, who was about 2 1/4 when we got him. 

&gt;So the first day after neutering REALLY hurts. He's also confused and scared. Most vets give him some painkillers for right after, and they are supposed to last for 1 1/2 or 2 days (this will show in the prescription), and let me tell you, those things wear out fast. My dog doesn't complain about pain, but it hurt so badly he barely moved that first day. The antibiotic he got from the vet was also really strong and completely knocked him out. I really mean that, at some point, we took off his cone and he could not summon the energy to open his eyes...

I'm not entirely sure what day and time he was actually neutered; we signed the papers to adopt him on Saturday and they said to come pick him up on Wednesday. Honestly he hasn't really been acting like a dog fresh out of surgery; he's been very energetic and has led me around the block for walks. He has painkillers that we give once per day, but they don't seem to affect his behavior too much. 

&gt;Pooping also seemed to hurt in those first days. In my case, Luci likes to poop while on the walk. We didn't walk far, nor fast those first days, but it did take about 30 minutes for him to be in a good pooping mood. Our own dog also really likes to poop only on a particular type of grass; yours might not so picky, but then again, he may want to scout all the pooping places before choosing one.

I'll have to consider that. I suppose he's probably still somewhat butthurt from his surgery. As for the grass, he's peed on it several times. It's a bit overgrown right now, maybe mowing it would help? ",2015-09-11 09:17:44+00:00,cuxqqdl,2.0,t1_cuxolt3,8923.0,dogs

Bad Juju is great for PvE. As long as you can get kill shots, you'll never reload and you'll have supers for days. Not as great in Crucible compared to higher impact pulse rifles. 

Invective is great just for the regenerating ammo. It's pretty average as an actual shotgun, but not bad.

3547,"&gt;You love guns, and ""don't learn"" from all of the shootings that happen.

As a guy who owns a few guns and has a permit to carry, please don't lump us all with the NRA. I place a very high value on the right to protect my own life if I ever find myself in danger, but it's hard to figure out how to balance that with keeping guns away from people who shouldn't have them. Pretty much every proposal to limit gun rights would really only affect law abiding gun owners like me.

A lot of states have implemented magazine size restrictions, for example. So a guy like me is limited to 10 rounds in a magazine, whether I'm plinking at the range or carrying to protect myself. But that doesn't matter to a guy robbing a store. He's already breaking the biggest laws, so he's not going to give a shit if he's also violating magazine restrictions.

And this is something that's less obvious, but pretty much every major shooting incident that you see on the news has happened in a ""gun free zone"", a place where even citizens who have their carry permits are not allowed to carry, generally including schools and places of business where the owners choose to prohibit carrying. It must be a lot easier to make the choice to shoot a place up if you can practically guarantee that all your victims will be unarmed.

3583,"It largely depends on which campus. There are three main locations; Metro in downtown Cleveland, East in Highland Hills off 271 and Harvard, and West in Parma at Pleasant Valley and York.

West is by far the nicest, and in my opinion feels the most like a college campus and less like a high school. Huge grounds and pretty scenery and the buildings are in good shape. If your girl is driving and parking though, it's generally the longest walk, since the buildings are surrounded by multiple rows of handicap spots and then more rows of faculty spots.

East campus is more crowded and urban, but still pretty nice and they've had a lot of construction and renovation in recent years. It's been a while since I've been there, but parking got real crowded during busy times of day. A couple of times I had to park at the businesses across Harvard. Still, only a couple minutes' walk, not bad at all.

Metro is my least favorite. The buildings are older, and it's not in the nicest part of town. You've got housing projects on the next block, and if you drive up Broadway to get there, the correctional facility is the last thing you pass before arriving lol. It is the only location with parking garages though, which is nice in winter, though they are poorly lit. I've never had any incidents there, but I have a concealed carry permit and I've never felt more tempted to break the rule and carry on campus than I did at Tri-C metro, especially since I primarily took night classes. My mother is also a professor at that campus, and she carries pepper spray.

As for the education, by and large I've had great professors at all three locations, apart from a couple of physics profs who had a hard time with the English language, which did not make it easy for me to understand their lessons. But in general, the professors seem to enjoy teaching, and I've honestly had worse experiences at Ohio State and Kent.

tl;dr - hard to beat for the price, especially as a county resident. I'd recommend West or East campus over Metro if possible.",2015-08-18 01:30:38+00:00,cu6kfab,1.0,t3_3hb797,44988.0,Cleveland

3708,"Agreed. I've only really put serious time into one MMO (SWTOR), but the loot system was way more restrictive.

Top level stuff came exclusively from raids, specifically Nightmare mode (third level of difficulty, very unforgiving. You need a very coordinated group with optimized gear to even attempt these).

Raids in SWTOR are made for groups of 8 or 16 people. Each boss in a given raid drops a specific gear slot token, and only drops one on 8m, and two on 16m. Everyone in the raid gets to roll need or greed on the drops. So, it's a guaranteed loot drop for someone, but only one (or two), rather than everyone having an equal chance to get something.

High end raiding guilds would literally schedule who gets to roll on what gear drops. Usually tanks got first dibs on armor, healers got weapons first.

3928,"I'm out of town today, but I'll leave you some (hopefully) helpful information :) keep in mind this is not the only way to do this, but it's by far the easiest and most forgiving for beginners. 

For starters, Bladedancer Hunter is by far the easiest class to run the sword with. The invisibility perks make the whole thing much simpler. You want the perk that gives you invisibility after crouching, and invisibility after a Blink Strike, plus Shadowjack to increase duration of all invisibility effects. Also, increased height double jump, NOT blink since it cancels invisibility. 

After clearing out the left and right sides from the crystal room,  while your group goes to the center window ledge (usually), you will instead go downstairs and grab the Chalice on top of the altar in front of where the Swordbearer spawns. When the Swordbearer comes out, bring him down quick. Use your rockets since you're not saving them for Crota. As soon as he drops the sword, grab it and run to the back left where you'll see a rock outcrop just high enough to double jump on top of, and you can reach Crota's platform from the rocks. 

Protip: practice that jump sequence as many times as it takes for you to be comfortable with it before actually starting the fight. Mistiming the jump while you have the sword will throw off the rhythm of the whole thing, so try to get it down first.

Anyway, when you get on the rocks, crouch and stay still until you go invisible, then immediately hop onto Crota's platform. This is a good time to call for rockets, as they should start hitting Crota just as you get in range. 

Once Crota's shield is broken by the rocket barrage, he becomes vulnerable and you can start hitting him; you don't need to wait for the kneeling animation. The safe and easy way to do it is three R2 slams in a row. Make sure you're walking forwards while doing it, as that speeds up the animation slightly and gives you a bit more time. You may be able to get 4 slams in if your timing is good, but don't do more than you feel safe. It's far better to get 3 hits and take one more sword rotation than to get 4 but not retreat in time and cause a wipe. 

After the third slam, Crota will start getting up and recharging his shield. Hit triangle to drop the sword, and then R1 to use your Blink Strike melee, which will make you invisible instantly upon hit. As Crota's shield recharges, his body will turn from yellow back to green. Call for rockets again, grab the sword and repeat the three R2 slams as soon as he goes down. 

This time, immediately start retreating. If the sword hasn't disappeared yet, you can ""glide"" away quickly with it by spamming R1 while airborne. Head back to the crystal room, share the Chalice with whoever needs it and get ready to do it again after Crota returns to his center platform. 

At level 33 or 34 on normal mode, two swords (4 sets of 3 slams) should be enough to kill Crota. If not, you'll have to deal with two Ogres before making a third run. 

Overall, just play it safe. Don't try for more sword slams than you know you can make, and leave yourself plenty of time to escape.

4053,"I actually like it compared to more traditional MMOs I've played. In SWTOR, for example, every boss in a raid is guaranteed to drop a certain armor piece, but only one for the entire raid and everyone has to roll for it.

In Destiny, anyone can get any available drop, but it's not guaranteed for anyone, and I personally find it more rewarding.",2015-06-16 11:38:09+00:00,cs89085,9.0,t1_cs886wx,3015.0,videos
