My parents are both native Croatian citizens, and a few years ago they had me sign some paperwork that they said would allow me to gain Croatian citizenship. I've visited Croatia and a few other places in Europe in my childhood (several places in Spain, Paris, and Berlin off the top of my head) and frankly, I miss it. Traveling on vacation is not an option with my limited time off from work and low pay, and honestly, having at least 3 weeks paid time off work and a decent wage sounds like a dream to me, and from what I've read, most of Europe is like that.

So, do I have any options for being able to live and work in Europe? The biggest problems I can see are the fact that English is my only language, and I only have an associate's degree from community college, and no real marketable skills. Outside of general retail experience, I worked for a few years as an electronics technician (hand soldering stuff) and now I run CNC machines in a factory. 

Also, since I assume this complicates things, I have a girlfriend. We've been together for about 5 years, and while we're not particularly concerned with getting married, we could if that would make things easier. She is a US citizen, and she's currently in school to become a pharmacist.

Long story short, I've had the Turtle Beach EarForce Stealth 400 headset for about 6 months. They've been fantastic in most aspects, but this week, the flimsy plastic headband gave out on both sides, so both earcups are dangling uselessly from their wires, no way to secure them to my head.


I've contacted Turtle Beach for warranty replacement, but I think I'll just sell the replacement set and get something different, as I can't imagine another set will avoid the same eventual fate.


Anyway, my favorite feature of the Stealth 400 was the dual volume settings. They connect wirelessly via a USB dongle that plugs into the front of the PS4, with an optical cable that goes from the USB dongle into the optical port on the back of the PS4. By setting headphone output to ""chat only"", you could control party and voice chat with one volume knob on the back of the earcup, and system and game volume with another knob.
I really would like a similar feature, but on a more sturdy design. The fact that they were wireless was nice, but I can do without. Plugging into the controller jack or the PS4 USB is fine.


So, got any recommendations for me?

Hey there DTG...long story short, I really want to get my hands on a Frontier Shell for my ghost.

While Googling around for sources of a Frontier Shell code, I saw a couple of posts on various forums saying that Year 1 codes, including the Frontier Shell, no longer work because the Special Orders vendor and kiosk are no longer in-game.

Can anyone confirm or deny? And if the codes will still work, does anyone know a cheaper way to get a Frontier Shell than shelling out (ha!) 90 bucks for the Digital Guardian Edition? I'd be able to recuperate some of that by selling my regular disk copy of Destiny, but still, cheaper is always better.

I took him to our rabbit expert vet this weekend, who gave me some medicated lotion to put on the area to prevent infection, and she told me to try to provide a softer floor for the rabbits' living area. I've read about the ""sock"" method (wrapping his feet in veterinary tape with shedded fur to line his bare skin), but the vet said that should be a last resort since he'll probably chew on the wrappings or eat them.

Currently, Donut and his ladybun Oreo have about a 5x7 foot fenced-off corner of our living room to themselves. They have a plastic-bottomed cage and litter box in a corner of this section, with Carefresh bedding. We have a section of carpet underneath all of it (the room's floor is bare hardwood), but it's pretty short and not the softest carpet I've ever seen. FWIW, Oreo (a Holland lop) still has very thick fur padding on all of her feet.

So, I want to know what I should do to help Donut heal. I'm going to start with getting some different flooring, and I was hoping you guys could help me out with that. Would softer carpet be enough? What sort of things should I be looking for in carpet? Just feel the softness for myself and guess? Should I put anything underneath it, like a layer of blankets to make it softer? I also plan to greatly increase the amount of space they have; whatever new flooring I get, I will buy enough to cover the entire room.

I feel terrible about my poor Donut getting sore hocks because of the living arrangements I've given him, and I want to do what I can to help him.

More specifically, we picked him up from his neutering since the shelter doesn't spay/neuter until a dog is already signed up to be adopted. He's about 3 years old, 85 pound black lab mix. 

My girl took him to the vet after picking him up while I went to work, and apparently he pooped on the floor while there. Since then, he's had two meals at home and I've taken him out for walks three times, and my girlfriend has taken him out twice. He's peed every time he goes out, but he hasn't pooped yet, and I'm worried that he'll just go inside again. After every walk I stand with him for 15 to 20 minutes waiting, but he doesn't go. How long is normal for a dog to go without pooping? 

Also, any suggestions for leash manners? He's generally pretty good while walking, but once in a while he'll get the idea that the leash is a tug toy, and I just can't convince him otherwise. It's already pretty frayed in spots where he held on to it. 

Thanks for any help you guys can offer!

Anyway, my G Pad downloaded a software update and was bugging me to install it. I never actually started the installation, but I woke up to find it had installed anyway. 

The update is fine overall, but it absolutely ruined the notification menu. It used to stretch out across the entire screen on either orientation, to take advantage of the large screen size. Now it's centered and does not expand at all. In fact, holding my G3 on top of the G Pad, the tablet's new notification bar is pretty much exactly as wide as the phone's. 

I looked around for an hour but I can't find any settings to get out back the way it was. I really hate the new layout.

Does that mean I just show up to the primary and somehow affiliate myself while I'm there? Or is there some kind of form to acquire ahead of time?

Long story short, Sparrow your way past Omnigul and friends (and please do a better job of Sparrowing than I did). Kill the Acolytes and summon the Blade of Crota. When you pick up his sword, instead of using it to clear the next room full of Hive, just run or airdash with it past all the adds and into the Grottos. Head straight for Sardon, and smoke him as soon as he spawns.

In the video I mostly used the R1+R1+R2 (RB+RB+RT) uppercut combo, plus a super between two R2 smashes, but I'm sure just a string of R2s would work just as well.

This fight is a bit of a pain in the ass, with Sardon making good use of the super on his own sword, plus your own disabled jump ability and the constant adds.
