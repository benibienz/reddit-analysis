We're all a little different Love, that's why we're all individuals! (Androgyne non binary identifying here myself). So long as you can rock the person you are that's all that matters!

You're wright in regard to getting your total net carbs. It's your carbs minus your fiber. Easy as!

You don't need to hit your fat target, it's there to keep you feeling full and not hungry, your protein though you really need to aim at hitting (even if you go over that its fine). Protein can come from a variety of different sources, cheese, eggs, meat, fish, chicken/turkey/duck. All depends on what you want to eat! Aim for fattier cuts of meat, chicken thighs over breats, tinned tuna mixed with some mayo or in oil is a great option. Avocado is awesome!

Doing a huge deficit compared to the recommended 20% is a very bad idea. It might seem like you're likely to lose weight faster but it's not sustainable cutting out so much energy for your body to live on. You body needs the recommended calories to burn the weight you want to lose. Not only that but you risk being so hungry/ tired/ irritable that binging/ going of keto is pretty inevitable.  Seriously, Sedentary&gt; 20gms of carbs &gt; middle ground protein &gt; fat to fill the rest of your calories. **remember fat is there to make you feel full, you do not need to hit your target on this, going over your protein a bit is ok!** Track you macros with MFP (**remember its TOTAL CARBS minus FIBER** = YOUR NET TOTAL)

You've got this. Ultimately you as much as we like to mentally 'control' things and have goals and WANT our body to do what we WANT it to do, our body is going to do whatever it likes with the input (food, water, electrolytes, deficit, exercise) we give it.

619,"The only person that is going to make your head right at the end of the day **is you**. There is no targeted weight loss solution to losing weight from one part of your body ie; your face. **A stall is 4 weeks or more of no weight OR inch/centimeter loss]** Are you sure you've stalled? Weightloss is NOT a linear process, do not expect to lose weight every day/ week/ month. Sometimes the weight will go up but overall it's a downward trend that's most important. My last stall last **3 months**. It turns out my deficit was TOO HIGH @ %30. Try the following;

* Recalculate your macros (and remember to do this every 10lbs or so) If your deficit is higher than %20, scale it back to %20.

* Make sure your protein is around the 0.8lb of lean body mass.

* Make sure your activity level is set to **sedentary**.

* Make sure you are drinking enough water, getting enough salt and potassium.

* Track your food intake closely, see if you are getting extra carbs snuck in somewhere ie; protein bars, shakes, pre-made snack items and eliminate them for a week and see if that makes a difference.

**Remember that this is a journey NOT a race. You didn't wake up at your highest weight over night. YOU ARE NOT going to wake up thin tomorrow morning. Be kind to yourself. Many of us have mental issues pertaining to food/diet and self perception issues. I highly recommend you find someone to talk to. I personally use [OA] (www.oa.org) but it's not for everyone. It is free however, and don't feel overwhelmed (on of the principles is take what you want and leave the rest :) )

Hi I'm Omni, Green loving androgyne from a land down under! I can't remember how many challenges I've been involved with around these parts but it's been a few.

I'm hoping to hit my next mini goal of 22lbs/ 100kg by the end of this challenge. I do KETO as my food and am an overeater and addict in recovery, utilizing the OverEaters Anonymous program for mental recovery.

My regular hairdresser injured herself and wasn't in and the lady who runs the salon got another person in. A self professed ""Colour Technician"" with over 30 years of hair dressing experience.  Anyhow my usual hairdresser apparently had a chat to this new woman and told her what I wanted *I was contemplating a bayalage in my roots to let my hair recover from all the bleaching and just regreen the grow out but intermingle the roots and such with the brown bayalage and green thing*. 

MY HAIR DOESN'T LOOK BLENDED AT ALL, THIS FUCKING BROWN IS JUST A FUCKING FUCK... I'M SO TEMPTED JUST TO SHAVE MY HEAD. I WISH I HAD BLEACH AS I'D JUST GET RID OF THIS FUCKING SHIT. BUT I'D KILL MY HAIR.

I am beyond uncomfortable right now. I'm due to meet new people next week and wanted to look omni and green and pretty instead of washed out and horrible and I can't get this shit fixed... $180 down the drain... The salon owner (who is my waxer) and this new woman were saying it looked good but I look like a fucking washed out pre-teen...

My gender identity dysphoria is tearing me a part. I don't know what to do... I do not feel like me at all. I don't even know what this new person I'm going to meet on tuesday (that im meant to be staying with as well) is going to say...

They stick together like a mofo so if you freeze them PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY separate the individually. No amount of butter knifing is going to help you separate these bitches after you freeze them.

I probably won't buy these again to be honest. I'm hoping that Herman Brot bread will expand to Wraps one day soon!

I've been in OA nearly 5 years and abstinent for nearly all that time. The program states to act 'as if', and the 'God' tone is really all encompassing of the thing you hand over to.

Anything I could 'hand over to', that was going to free my obsession from food.

All it takes is one more day at a time, for today I'm on keto, tomorrow i can make that decision again, I don't need to worry about it now :)

He moved from a one bedroom unit to a two bedroom unit + living area and such so we needed to do the furniture thing and fridge and washing machine thing as well.

There is bruising and there was a lot of blood where the root and nail bed tried to follow through with the false tip removal. I'm hopefully going to get this replaced and fixed in the next couple of days and fills, god how I need fills.

2574,"Ive had the polish once. It came right off with acetone remover or straight acetone. I rinse off my hands after i take it off then put a nail care polish on such as sally hansen growth or opi nail envy or a plain base coat then cuticle oil and hand moisturizer on to minimalize the drying out effect the acetone has. Just keep up the moisturizing and oil. Use acetone free remover for when you don't have gel polish on and you should be fine.

2720,"There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved - George Sand. 

A sense of loving and being loved is not restricted to one's spouse, children, parents, friends or associates. It can be applied to everything and everyone in God's world. To love and feel loved is nothing less than having a reverence for life.

Recovery in OA means regaining the freedom to love without conditions and without expectation of return. As a speaker once put it, ""I love YOU: I don't care whether or not you love me!""

To love unconditionally is a difficult concept for many. Only spiritual recovery can give us a concept of what it means.

For Today: How has my thinking about love changed in OA?

* Reflection, positive reaffirmation.

* Don't stress about weigh in day tomorrow.

* Cross stitch.

3090,"Welcome aboard! It can be really daunting around reddit and even keto subs at times but the more you read the more you know! A few places that might help:

* [Keto FAQ] (/r/keto/wiki/faq) This contains a majority of important information and questions that you may need answered. Read it, read it again. I actually have a copy printed out I take with me on trips so I can refresh my mind.

* [Printable list of acceptable love carb foods] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah8MbmZepQxWdGo4bnB2QmxxMUlmTzZUTXYzMURRLWc#gid=0) I've actually downloaded this to my phone so that when I'm shopping I can cross check more spontaneous purchases I may indulge in.

* [My Fitness Pal] (http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) This dovalakky thingymagjig is a goodsend! It enables me to plan out my meals so I know my carb count, but is also great for checking the carb count in things you might not have heard of. (You also have the ability to add your own recipes, and foods and have it calculate nutritional information for you) Find a easy installation script for macro counting [Here] (https://github.com/Surye/mfp-keto-userscript), unless you want to buy premium mfp, which some have done. 

* As you can see on the right side there are specific keto subs for women, vegetarians, weightlifters/fitness training types as well. All worth the check out!

Don't be afraid to pm me with any questions you might have or post on the sub in general. The posts with red writing you see are posted for people who are new, have questions and so forth as well each day :)",2015-11-12 00:41:23+00:00,cwx5n02,1.0,t3_3sgq5u,7020.0,keto

* ~~OA daily reading~~ : *I chose to put in order my thoughts and hang the walls of my mind with pictures of whatsoever things are lovely and of good report. - Joseph Murphy.*  Do I have the power to choose my thoughts, my moods? Yes! I can choose to put love at the center of my being, so its warmth and cheer will be with me always. I do not have to let the world's doings dictate my moods. I can determine what I want to think about, how I want to be.

When I pray and meditate, I choose faith; I expect the best and make room for it in my mind. I choose to let God's light be my strength and my joy.

**FOR TODAY: I choose things that are lovely to put in my mind.**

I've been going hard in regards to exercise since the start of May, but in the past two weeks I've now noticed an increase in hunger, whereby I was fine before. My question is this:

**Do I need to up my calorie intake/  change my macros?** I am getting all salts and potassium and magnesium covered.**Current weight is 262lbs and an esitmated %49 BF**

I don't want to jeopardise my loss rate, but I'm not sure if this hunger thing is a detrimental sign.
