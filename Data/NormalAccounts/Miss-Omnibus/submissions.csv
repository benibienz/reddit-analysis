Randomly had to have surgery yesterday (I got a few hours notice on Monday and told to fast from Midnight), to be into Chop SHOP AT 7am... When I got to the hospital at 6, my anesthesiologist asked me about the general medication and overall health stuff, and I alerted him to my ketogenic state. I had to give him the run down but He told me he'd hang saline bags instead of Dextrose and that the anti-inflammatory properties of keto should help me recovery quicker (he googled whilst i was there)!

I also had enough time to make a Coffee with some heavy cream in it and a low carb cheese and dill pickle sammich for post op, which I think is now what I see as the taste of LIFE...

I didn't sleep well last night at home but got the serious :GIVE ME ALL THE CARBS AND CHOCOLATES right now! from my brain last night, but i think it's just my body trying to cope with sudden trauma, so it can suck a bag of dicks... Dicks are keto... I WILL BE STRONG!

TL;DR: Stayed in keto for surgery by being open with my anesthesiologist; requested no dextrose IV, meal prepped for post operative; have a touch of the mental crazies but keeping my resolve.

My NSV involves me getting the courage to stay in keto fo and after surgery even though i wanted to binge the entire everything of food pyramids. I asked for no dextrose IV and had a Keto Coffee and slices of cheese and dill pickle on waking up, sticking with my normal eating plan when I came home... Keto has anti inflammatory properties so im not as puffy as I could have been and have little to no pain.

Contests are created by our members as a way to allow people to win a gift from them. Each contest rules and regulations is made up by the person who created it. Please read the contest carefully to see how to enter it. Contests that are ending soon are located in the sidebar!

**HOW DO I HOST MY OWN CONTEST, AND CAN I GIVEAWAY A USED POLISH?**

Host your own contest or giveaway by making a text post with the rules, the deadline, and a summary of how you will pick the winner (either by merit/your favorite, or randomly). Try to give your contest a catch title, and please declare a definite deadline. The rules of entry are up to you: tell a joke, write a poem, show us something cute, OR do a special mani in the contest's theme! **HOWEVER**: you may not require a user to like, subscribe, vote (etc) your blog, instagram, twitter, contest or any social media, **OR** pay for anything (like shipping).

And yes, you can totally giveaway used polishes as a prize, as long as you clearly note the condition of the polish in the contest. That way, people who are not interested in giving out their personal address or receiving used polish can choose not to enter. Whether a contest prize is a new polish from a wishlist or a giveaway, all prizes must be ordered/shipped and the appropriate POLISHED post must be made within 48 hours of contest close. Please use the polished flair for these posts.

**HOW DO I SCREENSHOT MY ORDER AND WHAT SHOULD I INCLUDE?**

You can usually take a screenshot by pressing the Print Screen (sometimes abbreviated PrtSc or PrntScr in the upper right corner) button on your keyboard, or command-shift-3 on a Mac--this will copy a picture of your screen. You then need to paste that picture into a graphic program of your choosing such as Paint and resize or edit as necessary. You can also use the tutorials here on using programs to do this for you. Please edit out personal information like names, addresses, or phone numbers. Please include the order confirmation number for verification. It is optional to include the gift ordered in the picture, if you would like it to be a surprise.

**And don't forget, please message the wonderful mods or myself if you have any questions or concerns about anything!**

Past contests include:

* Theme manicures/ pedicures, video games, books, tv shows, nature, pets, colours - it's endless!

* Partner up! Do a mani with another RAOP member

* Musical chairs! Quick quick, you've got to be in it to win it!

* Pay it forward, nominate another user and if they get chosen, so do you!

* ALL THE GREEN MANICURES ALL THE TIME (I have no idea which crazy did this one! :P)

I think this at least attempt 5 of my Granola cooking ways. I seriously back in my carb eating days was IN LOVE with museli (as we Australians call it). I needed that delicious breakfast fix of crunchy tastyness, and whilst this recipe has no fruit, I think it's my favourite so far!

[You're gonna LOVE my nuts!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0cgQkT4ScQ)

*Omnis Vanilla &amp; Gingerbread Granola* **SERVES 12**

**Ingredients**

* 180grams of pecan halves - chopped to your desired consistency

* 180grams of walnuts - chopped to your desired consistency

* 2 cups of unsweetened shredded or desiccated coconut

* 1 cup of almond and flax baking meal (alternatively 75gms of almond meal/flour and flax meal/flour mixed together)

* 2 egg whites - beaten into stiff peaks.

* 1 cup of Splenda (alternatively use your desired sweetener IF you wish no everyone is down with sweetener which is fine!)

* 1/8th cup of Imitation vanilla essence

* 1/4 cup of Torani sugar free syrup (I used Ginger Bread but Vanilla or pumpkin spice or caramel you desire will work too!)

**Method**

1/ Preheat your oven to 180 degrees CELSIUS and line some trays with baking paper.

2/ Add all dry ingredients together and mix!

3/ Fold in egg whites well.

4/ Mix in Syrup and Vanilla essence.

5/ Spread mixture out on lined trays and bake for 15 minutes.

6/ Stir the mixture on the trays and change the placement on shelves if needed ( remember things cook faster on the top shelf of an oven)

7/ Leave for another 15 minutes or until golden looking.

8/ Pull out of oven and let cool completely before storing.

I use firefox and since itI became aware of it I was using the mfp hack to edit my nutrient input in per grams... I wanted to update my entry point as I've had to take a decrease in calories, but it seems to have nullified the script and all I get is annoyances and priemum user shit from mfp. I even went so far as to download chrome as I read that it was still fine there, but no luck at all :( I know a lot of people kick it old school with working out their macros, or use other programs but I'm just wondering if anyone knows of a patch I'm unaware of for MFP? I don't p[artivularly want to have over the monies just for increments, but it really does work for me.

Mnay thanks and Love and Bacon and Cheese!

**Zombie Quotes!**

* “It's not about surviving. It should be about love. When you know love...that's what makes this life worth it. When you live with it everyday. Wake up with it, hold on to it during the thunder and after a nightmare. When love is your refuge from the death that surrounds us all and when it fills you so tight that you can't express it.”  - Carrie Smith

* I wasn't a sex symbol, I was a sex zombie. -Veronica Lake

* “This is the way the world ends; not with a bang or a whimper, but with zombies breaking down the back door.” - Amanda Hocking

* “I love zombies. If any monster could Riverdance, it would be zombies.” - Craig Ferguson.

* A non-frightening zombie is a lame zombie - Scott M. Gimpie

* “It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains.” Seth Grahaeme -Smith

* Swedish fish SF (I think)

So I got this made itch the other week to move from granny squares and blankets to Afgahn Tunisian. I follow videos on youtube because bits of paper with static pictures hit me right in the rage.

I'm using [This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIbIirzNiyg) tutorial here and I thought I was going well until I realised the shape the edges of my blanket had.

I've tried to google this but nothing came up at all. Both ends of my blanket thus far look like this. I'm wondering if I'm going to have to unravel this and go back to the beginning. (I am intending on making this blanket queensize. I thought perhaps the angular shape is to do with tension maybe or if im actually dropping stitches. And also the scallop sorta row ends?

* I do strength training at the gym for 60 minutes x5 days a week, swim for 60 minutes x3 times a week and walk at a good burning pace 45-60 minutes x7 days a week.
