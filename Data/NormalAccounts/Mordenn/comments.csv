Mankind divided needed 3 million to even break even (as per the link). Obviously it was projected to make even more because you don't make games with the intention of breaking even, you do it to make profit.

If the sequel needed to make 3 million, and didn't sell on pace with a game that only sold 2.18 million, you can do the math.

Splinter Cell is an even more clearcut case that you conveniently ignored, because a direct report from Ubisoft themselves said it underperformed their expectations.

25,"You're right that Purify probably won't drastically change the meta right now, even with minor tweaks. My argument isn't that it would, just that the precedent of changing a card without playtesting due to community backlash is a dangerous one.

As for spells being win-conditions not the heart of the deck, I'd argue all decks are built around their win conditions from the ground up, not the other way around. You don't gather a bunch of cards together and then say ""Now let's figure out how to make this win"", you start with a goal and then build a deck that fits it.

I will admit that creatures have a *lot* more potential to be meta defining than spells, mostly because Blizzard has been hesitant to make spells that really define decks due to the lack of spell counterplay. But that doesn't mean it can't happen. Let's not forget that there was a point in time where Mind Control had to be nerfed up to 10 mana because priest was dominating the control meta so hard.",2016-08-09 05:58:16+00:00,d6a2dks,10,t1_d6a1xaw,1093,hearthstone
26,"As I mentioned in another comment chain, Druid as a class was basically defined by Force-Roar, both of which were spells, until Force was nerfed. Miracle was as much defined by its spells as it was by Leeroy, which is why it was able to return as a viable deck briefly even after Leeroy was nerfed. Or how about Anyfin Can Happen, an incredibly frustrating combo deck enabled entirely by a single spell and already existing cards. Spells can be every bit as meta-defining as minions can in Hearthstone. 

Not just in standard either. Look at Arena, where Flamestrike and Fireball essentially singlehandedly made mage one of the most competitive classes. ",2016-08-09 05:36:52+00:00,d6a1ucw,8,t1_d6a1nul,420,hearthstone
27,"But that's my point. One card can tip an archetype into viability and make cards that were previously pretty good downright broken. Priest has cards that can be considered the best in the game for what they do. Entomb is the best removal spell for long games. Cabal is one of the biggest tempo swings in the game. Northshire is a draw engine that's easy to get online and PW:S is arguably the best cantrip in the game. Who's to say that a single card that allows priest to reliably make it to late game couldn't put them in a position where they become incredibly frustrating to play against?

Look at other CCG's as well. Skullclamp was a card that basically defined an entire meta by itself because Wizards changed it right before release without playtesting it, and then they had to ban it in essentially every format because it gave rise to an incredibly broken set of decks. One unplaytested card can make a huge difference. ",2016-08-09 05:25:14+00:00,d6a1jh1,6,t1_d6a0y0r,1309,hearthstone
28,"If the classic cards are too strong, Standard as a format becomes incredibly stagnant because expansion cards get played a lot less and deck archetypes don't change when new content is released. That was the problem with druid for basically 90% of this game's lifespan and people hated it.

As for cards like BBB and the rest, you have to remember not every card is designed to be competitive. BBB is a 'stepping stone' card (which I don't think should exist either, frankly) and the rest are for silly combo decks, like the 'silence priest' deck that Ben Brode talked about in his Purify video. Not everything is for Spike.

Now even Ben Brode admits that Priest is in a bad spot with having too few competitive options at the moment, but I don't think the way to solve that is by taking uncompetitive cards and trying to force them into playability, it's by looking at where priest is lacking and adding new cards to address that. You can accomplish the same thing without taking away existing design space. ",2016-08-09 05:15:50+00:00,d6a1acm,4,t1_d6a0ta4,1019,hearthstone

Ask people about Alexstraza's Champion and Drakonid Crusher as recently as a few months ago and most people would have considered them unplayable in constructed. Now they're a two of in one of the most popular decks on the ladder.

If you just go about buffing cards because they don't fit in the current meta you may make a few of them more playable, but you're also introducing a lot of potential for imbalance with unintended interactions. Unleash the Hounds is practically a case study for exactly that. Personally I'd rather have a few cards be weak than have the game's balance thrown off kilter with frequent changes.",2016-08-09 04:51:40+00:00,d6a0lsq,2,t1_d69y5tc,4378,hearthstone
31,"&gt;reworking it into something else worth a damm and reintroducing it when needed.

So either you skip playtesting in order to get it out on time (which is a recipe for unbalanced disasters) or you only give priests two new cards while every other class gets three (which is strictly worse than just giving them purify). How is either of those cases a more desirable outcome?

They've said themselves they know priest is weak. Purify was never going to be the card that changes that. In fact I'd argue that one card should never be the one to make such drastic changes in class power level, because that's how you get things like r/hearthstone's favorite 4 mana 7/7.

I can understand people having problems with this system and its potential for abuse, but it's been in place for half a decade now without much complaint.

The point of this initiative isn't to make immediate profits, it's to combine all their offerings into a single cohesive ecosystem.

110,"It's a bit early for a comprehensive tier list but I'll list what I think are the most powerful weapons I've seen so far. 

* *Katanas*: Remember how in every previous Dark Souls game, Katanas have been super broken because they have such high counter damage, great scaling, and that oh-so-frustrating charge thrust attack? Well I have some news for you, DS3 has continued that tradition and then some. Not only are all those things still true, but the new weapon arts make Katanas even more versatile by adding in lightning fast dash strikes and a potential parry. Each individual Katana has its own strengths and weaknesses. Washing Pole has great reach, Uchi has good scaling and a perfect moveset, Chaos Blade is Chaos Blade, and even Darkdrift has some niche uses against turtling opponents. 

* *Greatsword/Black Knight Axe*: These two are powerful for the exact same reasons: great movesets combined with incredible range and damage. Take advantage of your hyper-armor to trade damage and you'll usually come out on top. Plus you can shore up your only real weakness (roll-attacking into a whiffed swing) by equipping a buckler in your offhand to parry your opponents punish very reliably. 

* *Gotthard Swords*: Haven't seen anyone else talking about these puppies but all you need to know about them is that they have a 500+ damage thrusting attack out of a roll that comes out almost instantly with reach matching that of most polearms. You can imagine that's going to be pretty powerful, especially with a Leo ring in the mix.

* *Longsword (and friends)*: Bread and butter weapon for a reason. This thing stunlocks like a champ and pumps out damage, especially when buffed/resin'd. Because of the way poise works in DS3 you can reliably punish obvious attacks by attacking into them and hitting first, which will invariably stagger your opponent before they connect. Special mention to the Dark Sword, which has A strength scaling in exchange for a slightly weaker moveset.

Two spell slots per encounter basically pigeonholes them into spamming eldritch blast if things go beyond a few rounds, which a boss fight should.

Personally I think it'd be a lot more fun to homebrew up something that superficially resembles the warlock class but can provide a bit more variety and excitement than just spamming out Eldritch Blasts each round. Maybe they can call upon their dark patron to summon more minions as the fight goes on. Give them some fun powers that fit their patron, too. A feylock might have a vampire-esque charm ability, a Great Old One might have some insanity/hallucination causing spells, etc. So long as the abilities still match the warlock flavor and make for a fun fight, I don't think players will mind that it's not following the PC class rules.

184,"&gt;This is on there because I had so many people yelling at me to include Antimony from New Monarchy

But the reason the Antimony is such a powerful PvP sniper isn't because of its base stats, it's because it has unflinching, snapshot, and incredibly high base aim assist. Defiance has none of those things and furthermore has a set scope which means you can't get any aim assist enhancing scopes like shortgaze or longview on it either.

&gt;I had it on there originally, but then I realized that the range increasing perk barely adds anything. Its range is pretty poor in comparison to some of the other shotguns out there. That's why I didn't include it. It's basically nothing special. Cocoon is cool, but not enough to justify using it over a shotty with a better range stat.

Agree to disagree here. I think Cocoon is absolutely worth the perk slot in PvE. Knowing your shotgun will always have six shots when you switch to it in the heat of battle is incredibly useful, especially if you're using it as a backup weapon. If you're up close and personal with enemies, especially the aggressive melee ones like sword-captains, minotaurs, and knights, you want to be spending as little time reloading as possible and cocoon seems tailor made for that. I also think range is nowhere near as important for PvE as it is for PvP, it's easier to engage from ranges where the damage dropoff is nonexistent.

194,"As other comments have mentioned, Sword Logic isn't a system of magic that somehow makes you more powerful the more you kill. If anything, it's the exact opposite: You kill to show you were more powerful than what you killed, and therefore more worthy of existence. You're not gaining power by destroying your opponent, you're showing that you were more powerful all along.

It's predicated on the philosophy of the Deep, as described to Aurash in the Book of Sorrows: The idea that life, all life, is the struggle for existence. Therefore, the only meaning in life is being able to assert and protect that existence. Anything else is a distraction, at best. 

Sword Logic is the natural extension of that idea. If all that matters is asserting the right to exist, then we should constantly test that right by fighting everyone we come across. If we kill them, it means we were more powerful and deserve to keep existing. If we lose, then we weren't worthy of existing in the first place and deserved to be wiped out. Either way the Universe will be moving a step closer to the 'final form' that the Deep and Toland describe: a universe dominated by a force that has mastered existence so fully that other life can only exist by its will alone.",2015-10-04 11:16:08+00:00,cvno126,1,t3_3nfps3,7513,DestinyTheGame

210,"He said it was meant to sell figurines and promote sexy cosplay at first, then later claimed that had been a mistranslation. Finally he claimed that Quiet had a secret reason for dressing like that, and would serve as an antithesis of scantily clad women in videogames.

211,"&gt;Hand picked examples, to counter Quiet he asks why The End wasn't naked, ignoring that the first fully naked character in MGS was Raiden and that male ass is a huge meme in MGS. He describes how The Boss is a great female character but ignores how Eva in the very same game fills the role Quiet does to a T basically filling Kojima's sexy female quota.

The difference being Kojima wasn't claiming Raiden's nudity was meant to be a meaningful commentary or some sort of 'antithesis to men in games who are exposed' like he did with Quiet. It's clearly intended to be silly and out there and that fit the tone of the game pretty much on the nose. Also MGSV is trying its damndest to be gritty and serious, so that sort of thing feels a lot more out of place than it did in earlier, more campy installments. 

&gt;Essentially makes the claim Kojima has written better females characters so if you don't constantly demand Kojima do so every time than you don't love the series as much as Jim does.

Holding Kojima to higher standards of writing/characterization because he's shown he's capable of reaching them isn't unfair at all. In fact it's pretty common practice to hold artists to standards they've shown themselves to be capable of achieving. People expect more out of the dialog of a Tarantino movie than they would out of a Michael Bay movie, and that's not unfair either. 

&gt;Ignores his own above reasoning and makes a childish sex joke while showing a naked The End on screen and making sex sounds.

His point wasn't that crudeness or sexualization are inherently bad. His point was that people should be honest about using them, not try to pass them off as mature storytelling with a handwaved in-universe excuse.

It causes the same uncomfortable dissonance for me that the B&amp;B squad did in MGS4, where they're supposedly war-torn, guilt-wracked PTSD survivors and yet you can make them dance to j-pop and do photoshoots in their boss fights.
