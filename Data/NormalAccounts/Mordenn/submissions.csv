Be wary of very minor Curse of Strahd spoilers below. 

Basically the party barbarian, a really well liked character by everyone at the table (myself included) was killed in the most anti-climactic way possible. Strahd had raised a bunch of zombies from the graveyard the party was in when they offended him and was essentially watching the adventurers fight them off for his own amusement.

When it became clear that the fight was won for the heroes he vindictively tossed a fireball into the melee to 'help them clean up the stragglers' because he was growing bored. I figured it'd be a good way to demonstrate his character to the party, and they were all healthy enough that it wouldn't kill any of them. The problem is that one of the zombies actually managed to make its save and barely survived. Then the party wizard missed on his turn when he tried to finish it off, meaning it got a chance to attack the barbarian. Strahd zombies get three attacks total and on the first attack it rolled very high damage and managed to knock her out, with the next two automatically killing her by forcing 4 failed death saves. 

It wasn't what I'd intended, but I didn't think it was going to be such a big deal because the group was level 6 and had a cleric with most spell slots still available. However it turns out she'd neglected to prepare either revivify or gentle repose, meaning they had no way of resurrecting the barbarian or even preserving her for future ressurection. 

The group is okay with party deaths when they're suitably epic or caused by someone's own mistakes, but this was admittedly very anti-climactic and frankly just bad luck. For the rest of the session the mood around the table was very muted and you could tell people weren't as into things.

Did I fuck up by letting this happen? Should I have fudged the rolls? More to the point, how can I bring the mood back up and get people invested again? This is the first campaign I've ever DMed and I want to make it an enjoyable one so people will be interested in doing more in the future.

The line you here when you cast your ultimate is the same line you'll hear when an enemy uses theirs, but there's a separate line for when a teammate uses their ultimate. For example a D'Va will say ""NERF THIS"" when you or an enemy uses self destruct, whereas an ally D'Va will instead say ""Self destruct sequence activated!"".

There are a few handy ways to tell which line is which without memorizing all ~42 lines, though.

1. Ally lines will generally be quieter than enemy ones. Not only this, but they are generally calmer as well. For example an enemy Pharah will loudly shout ""JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE!"" whereas an ally will give a much more lowkey ""Rocket barrage incoming"". Similarly an enemy Reaper will yell ""DIE... DIE... DIE..."" while an allied Reaper will simply state ""Clearing the area"".

2. If a character is speaking in their native language, it's an enemy ultimate. Heroes like Zarya, Mercy, Genji, and Mei will all shout in their native tongues when an enemy uses their ultimate, whereas ally lines will be in english. 

3. Some heroes ONLY have enemy/self ultimate voice lines. Reinhardt and Torbjorn, for example, only have ""Hammer Down!"" and ""MOLTEN CORE!"" respectively. 

It may not seem like much, but knowing whether it's the enemy or ally Hanzo who's ulting can mean the difference between pushing hard onto the objective or backing off  of it at a crucial moment during the fight.

When done right, they're an incredibly rewarding way to experience PvP against a large variety of players and builds without much fuss. When the host or participants don't know how to make things run smoothly, however, it can be quite frustrating for everyone involved. Hopefully this quick guide can help prevent that from happening!

**What's a Fight Club?**

A fight club is when a host summons multiple red phantoms from Red Soapstone Signs to battle each other in a predetermined arena. Fights are 1v1, with the winner staying in the arena to take on the next combatant until they die. The rest wait to fight in the order they were summoned, with the host keeping a constant stream of phantoms coming so that there's always someone ready to fight. 

**Where can I find one?**

The most popular location for Fight Clubs right now is immediately after the Pontiff Sulyvahn bonfire in Irithyll, though they can also be found at the High Wall of Lothric or Kiln of the First Flame. If you put a red soapstone sign down at these locations frequently enough, sooner or later you'll be summoned in for one.

**When participanting...**

* Wait your turn! You fight in the order you were summoned, so if someone was already there when you were summoned go ahead and let them fight first.

* ...except if the host points at you. That means you're up. Jump on in and give a good show of it!

* Pay attention and step up to the plate promptly when it's your turn. One of the best parts of fight club is that you don't have to wait very long between each fight. Don't diminish that. 

* Follow standard dueling etiquette when you fight. Use any consumables/buffs you want at the start and then give an emote to kick things off. No healing during the fight, though Ashen Estus is generally acceptable. Stay in the arena. You can use estus to heal up to full between each fight.

* Make sure you're embered before you put your sign down! You get the bonus health when you invade via soapstone signs, so if you aren't embered you're missing out on a lot of health compared to your opponents! (thanks mypasswordishey for the reminder) 

* Do NOT attack the host. If you don't want to keep going, or don't want to participate in the first place, just black crystal out. No need to ruin things for everyone by attacking the host and causing a total clusterfuck as everyone tries to kill you. 

* and if someone does attack the host, put aside your current fight and help kill them. Just be sure to avoid killing the host in the ensuing brawl! (thanks huntingbeasting for this one) 

**When hosting...**

* Do not kill the area boss. That means no killing Aldrich if you plan on using the most popular arena. If you do kill the boss, you'll only be able to summon two phantoms at a time even with the Dried Fingers item. This means your summons will spend a lot of time sitting around waiting for people to get summoned in, which isn't fun for anyone.

* Make it clear what's going on. Toss some prism stones around the edges of the arena. Wear silly armor and use silly weapons. All of these things will let your summons know what's going on and what to expect. 

* Try to keep 4 phantoms around at a time. More than that and people have to wait a long time to fight. Fewer and you risk having to scramble frantically to summon someone if a fight ends too quickly.

* Stay out of the arena! Unless you're winding the club down and want to duel the last victor, stay clear of the actual fighting. Your job is to keep a steady stream of phantoms coming, not to interfere with the fighting itself. This is especially important if either fighter is using magic like Homing Crystal Soulmass or Human Dregs, which can target you even if the caster doesn't intend it. 

* Look over the people you're summoning before you summon them. Try to get a good amount of build variety if you can. No one wants to go up against nothing but Dark Swords and Washing Poles. Pull in a cool cosplay build or two. This also helps with the next tip...

* If someone Black Crystals out, remember their name and don't summon them again. Some people don't want to take part in a fight club. Respect that and don't keep summoning them for something they clearly don't want to do. 

* Remember that invaders are still invaders. Don't expect them to know or follow these rules. Be ready to be attacked when you see an invasion message. On the other hand, if they are friendly then let them take part! 

* Don't mix and match summons from red and white signs. White phantoms will not get the embered health bonus whereas red phantoms will, so you're putting the white phantoms at an unfair handicap. 

* Communicate! Well, as best you can at least. Point to who's up next, wave to new combatants, and applaud your victors. Make things livelier than just sitting around.

For example, the party might be sneaking into an evil wizard's tower when they're startled by the sudden appearance of a pre-programmed illusory image of the wizard himself. Having them roll initiative as soon as the image appears ups the tension and helps put the players in the shoes of their on-edge characters, but it also slows things down and takes the players out of the moment. Furthermore, the argument could be made that by having them roll initiative you're implying that there's no option besides fighting, when they might otherwise try talking or hiding. This might influence your players to attack when they otherwise wouldn't if no initiative roll had been asked for.

I'm curious what other players thought about this sort of thing, especially given how prevalent it is in Curse of Strahd. Reading through the adventure there's at least three sections where they have the players roll initiative against illusions or inanimate objects, and in at least one of those circumstances it's actually incredibly harmful if the players attack instead of waiting to see what happens. Do you think it's justified to help keep the players immersed in how on-edge their characters might be in these stressful situations, or is it a cheap 'gotcha!' tactic that needlessly slows things down and makes the players feel foolish without really adding anything to the experience?

Anyone have any experience to weigh in with, or opinions on the matter? I'm curious how other GM's have dealt with this in their sessions.

Firstly, does anyone else think that making the artifact locations truly random (as the adventure suggests) is a really bad idea? You can get some really bad situations, like a sentient Sun Sword being found in the very first session and trivializing every vampire encounter for the rest of the adventure. Or all three items being stuck deep down in the catacombs instead of spread around Barovia. I'm thinking of just stacking the deck before the Tarokka reading so that I can ensure that they're all spread out and that the Sun Sword is either in the catacombs or the Amber Temple. 

Secondly, what are people's thoughts about the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind in a party with no clerics or paladins? It's pretty useless as is, so I had a few ideas. First was to let non-divine classes attune to it but at the cost of efficiency. All charge costs would be doubled and obviously the turn undead/turn unholy ability wouldn't do anything. The second idea was that if they gave it to one of the good-aligned priests, that priest in turn would gain enough power to cast higher level healing spells for them when they came back in the future (maybe even Greater Restoration?).

Finally, I'm worried about my characters finding the Tome of Strahd underwhelming. It's given the same pomp and circumstance as the other two artifacts, each of which are incredibly powerful, but ultimately it's not much more than exposition that most players will already know by the time they obtain it. I don't want to do the obvious cop-out and make it a magic item as well, but I was thinking maybe it could have a bit more information about Strahd and his secrets? Maybe information about a few traps or passages in the Castle? I'm really at a loss with this one.

Absolutely no healing or even spellcasting in general, barring an eldritch knight or arcane trickster.

Compounding this problem is the fact that the campaign seems to be incredibly stingy with magical weaponry.

I understand not wanting to give the players too much of an edge too early, to maintain tension, but I also don't want them to get totally wiped out with no hope of fighting back if they ever encounter a spectral enemy (which can happen pretty quickly, depending on player choices).

I don't want to be a buzzkill and tell people they can't play the characters they want to play, especially when they're so excited about them. However I also want them to enjoy themselves during the campaign and not be endlessly frustrated by magical traps/enemies that they have no recourse against.

The biggest problem is that outside of random cruelty, there's really no incentive for going rogue that outweighs the almost certain inevitable death.



Why is that a bad thing, I can already hear you asking. After all, rogues are assholes who ruin other player's fun and take their stuff. Why in the world would we want more of them? 



Because **Rogues need to exist for the Dark Zone to have any tension at all**. The possibility of going rogue is what creates that mounting excitement as the extraction chopper approaches and you eye the other agents all lined up with items strapped to their backpacks, wondering if any of them are going to try and take everything. It's what allows that moment of ultimate satisfaction you finally track down the player who shot you in the back earlier and settle your crosshairs on his unaware head. Perhaps most importantly, it's what creates those perfect moments of validated trust when you risk it all by teaming up with a stranger to clear out a dangerous building, then part ways with a friendly wave instead of a bullet in the back. 



In short, **the Dark Zone without rogues is just a much blander, much less interesting PvE zone that just so happens to have friendly fire**. Every game needs a villain to be interesting, and this is no exception.

So what are some ways the game could encourage that tension, instead of making it just a random cruelty simulator for large groups? How could the Rogue system be changed to make it more fun for both the Rogues and the agents hunting them down?

1. No more wallhacks outside of manhunts. Rogues should be able to lie low and wait out their status if they manage to get away from the initial shootout. Instead, give nearby agents a warning that a Rogue agent is in their vicinity. Give the hunters a chance to actually hunt, using sonar pings and sweep tactics to find their target before the timer expires. In exchange, Rogue status should last longer by default.



2. Manhunt timers are longer the more people are in your group, but no longer refresh in combat. Everyone can see them on radar and through walls. Once completed, you have to extract to get your credits. Right now most manhunts devolve into the targets being holed up in a one way alley with a ladder entrance, hoping that the other side loses interest before they run out of bullets. This isn't fun for either side. Putting a strict time limit on things instead of having the timer perpetually refresh to full duration makes it actually feasible to successfully 'complete' a manhunt, but necessitating an extraction means you can't just hole up in one place for the whole duration. 



3. Less blindsiding. If we're going to increase the incentives for going rogue, we need to decrease the most frustrating part for other players: getting randomly killed from 100-0 by a player who was neutral just an instant ago. Currently you are not flagged as Rogue until you do more than 20% of the target's health in damage. Instead, players should have a 'buffer shield' equal to ~30% of their max health that only applies to PvP damage between two neutral players. If one neutral player shoots another, it damages this buffer shield before doing any health damage. Upon breaking this shield, the player is instantly flagged as Rogue. This means that the target gets a lot more time to react and possibly escape. Not only that, but it also cuts down on annoyances such as 'rogue baiting' and being turned rogue by someone running in front of your gun. Alternatively, if that's too drastic a change, make it so you that after someone steals your gear you can track them on the map for a minute after spawning for a chance at revenge. It offers some interesting counterplay and a chance to get the drop on them in turn, evening the odds a bit. 


Thanks for reading through that giant wall of text. If you have any suggestions as well, I'd love to hear more. Frankly I find the Dark Zone experience to be incredibly fun so far and really want to see it have some longevity.



TL;DR Rogues are what make the Dark Zone so fun. We should give them a few more tools to survive and in exchange make it harder for them to blindside players while neutral.

However, that line of thought ignores a critical part of the Institute's plan that only becomes clear once you read all the terminals underground: **The institute is not looking to save the people of the Commonwealth.** In fact, they're waiting for them to die off (and in some cases, helping speed that process up) so that they can emerge and build their 'perfect' civilization without any ties to the Old World. The Institute's future is bright only for those in the Institute itself, everyone else is going to suffer a whole lot and ultimately die. 

The cruelty they inflict on the people of the Commonwealth isn't an unfortunate byproduct of scientific advancement, it's the end goal in and of itself.

It's been their plan all along and with the new nuclear generator, any ties they still had to the surface have been severed completely. 

A Sole Survivor wouldn't be able to convince them to stop kidnapping people, or stop building 3rd generation Synths (as I've seen people claim) because these two tasks are of core importance to the Institute's ultimate mission. What they've been working towards for 200 years. It'd be easier to convince Maxon to allow Super Mutants to join the BoS than it would be to convince the Institute division heads to stop their plan and start helping Wastelanders instead of killing them. 

TL;DR the Institute ending is by far the worst one for the people of the Commonwealth. They are not the long term hope for humanity people are painting them to be, they're egotistical scientists who want to start their own empire.

Even with gun modding, only two gun archetypes can use this caliber: the Hunting Rifle and the Bolt-Action Pipe guns. Even more strangely, by the time you reach the Gun Nut rank 3 required to mod your hunting rifle receiver for .50 rounds, you could instead just put a 'powerful' receiver on an Assault Rifle and do more damage per shot with a semi-automatic weapon that uses much more common ammunition. It really seems like this caliber of bullet just has no reason to exist from a gameplay perspective. Perhaps it's a relic of a dummied out weapon that used it by default? Or maybe it's there for future DLC guns?

TL;DR there's only two guns that can even be modded to use .50 caliber rounds, and by the time you get the perks to do it they're already completely outclassed.

You can and will be matched against full or partial premades, who will use their ability to coordinate to stomp all over your squad of randoms, regardless of how well you're playing the objectives or scoring kills. 

You will be put into games in progress as often as you aren't, if not more. Generally your team will be down by over 1000 points, and the enemy will have full super and possibly heavy as well. You will have neither. This is even more frequent now that so many weekly crucible quests and Iron Banner require winning, meaning there's so many more quitters than usual.

The matchmaking algorithm will assume that if you have above a 1.3 K/D, you're capable of carrying a team full of people with no mics and a .75 K/D average between the lot of them.

And all of that on top of the usual multiplayer fun of [immortal, teleporting enemies](http://gfycat.com/LameFavorableArthropods). 

It's becoming a chore to do the daily crucible bounties, much less Iron Banner. And the worst part is, these are all issues that've existed since day 1.

All having twenty shards does is give you an extra item from anywhere in the raid in addition to whatever Oryx would have naturally dropped. If Oryx would have dropped nothing but two moldering shards, you'll get those two shards and one item. And if that item happens to be something Oryx can drop, like a raid primary, it might seem as if you got the weapon from Oryx and the shards from your shard-drop. If that were the case, though, it'd be possible to get nothing but 4-5 moldering shards from Oryx if you got moldering shards to drop from Oryx AND rolled moldering shards as your shard-drop. However in seven raids I've never seen this happen to a single player, meaning either my fireteams are very very lucky or it's just not possible. 

TL;DR If you only got one Oryx drop and moldering shards, it means you didn't get any normal loot from Oryx and your moldering shards just happened to give you an item on his drop table.

Edit: I'm seeing a lot of people claiming they actually have just gotten 2-4 shards and nothing else, so perhaps the people I've been in fireteams with have just had exceptional luck. As I mentioned, I'm basing this off of seeing ~38 people receive loot from Oryx with shards and all of them getting at least one item, which I figured was statistically significant. Either my experience was just an outlier or the chances of getting shards from your shard-drop is incredibly low. 
",DestinyTheGame,"Your 'free drop' from moldering shards cannot be more moldering shards.

This seems to only be the case outside, as when I'm inside they provide quite a bit of light.

Any idea what might be causing this? Or, more importantly, how I can fix it? Even with a torch out I can't see more than 2 feet in front of me at night and if this keeps up I'm going to have to go back to Vanilla nights, which would be a bummer.
