785,"It really wasn't a huge thing.


I was already mostly withdrawn from my family. They never really cared about me and I barely cared about them. 

Well one day over summer break I had a depressive episode I guess it could be called. I didn't leave my house for a week. Only my mom and my dad know I was there. The rest of my family had no clue where I was ( they live right down the street from me). 


I just stayed home trying to make myself better. I was wondering why things of food were being brought by people to my family, but I didn't care cause hey free food.  


At the end of the week my uncle call my house. I get forced to answer it. He asks who he is talking to. I tell him it's me and he starts freaking out. He tells me everyone thinks I am dead ( I didn't catch the cause of death) and that they held a memorial service at my church. Which is odd because I hadn't been there in years. 

I just had to sort everything out. Some people were mad because they thought I faked my death to get sympathy. Nevermind the fact that they could have easily called me to find out. It was just a really odd experience.",2015-12-05 05:10:18+00:00,cxnspt4,3.0,t1_cxns2ix,1468.0,AskReddit

915,"A few years ago I went with my grandmother and my older sister to help with renovating a place for missionaries to stay. It just happened to be an abandoned all girl orphanage. 


Now I know I sound like a white person in a horror movie. The reason I agreed to go was that I had no choice. My parents made me go during spring break. Also I was getting paid sooooo.


So we get there and the first thing I think of looking at this place is how much it looks like the Overlook Hotel from The Shining. The floors didn't have patterned carpet but it had bright red carpet. As I went into the death hotel I saw a 10 year old in a white tank top just staring. Staring with eyes that looked like they looked straight into my soul. The only thought going through my head was, "" Imma die here."" 


So nothing interesting happens during the day. Just renovating stuff. That night we were eating dinner and the tv just turns on. The TV was really old and had no cable so it was just static. We just turned it off and thought nothing of it. 

That night I struggle to go to sleep. I eventually do but I wake up at around 3:00 am. I feel the need to go to the bathroom so I begin to get up. As I am sitting on the bed about to stand I hear something that I will never forget. I hear the sound of two little girls laughing. My sister is 15 at the time and my grand mother is 74 so I know it can't be either of them. I then decide I really don't need to go to the bathroom and get back in bed. I hide under my blanket like the ghost will never break through my soft blue blanket. 


Well nothing happened. We only stayed another day after that. The only thing that happened that night was some more laughing. I did not go investigate. The next day I was outta there.",2015-10-31 19:53:12+00:00,cwjqpob,1.0,t3_3qz72m,13673.0,AskReddit

955,"Me and my ex broke up but still tried to be friends. Then I found out that she was telling her friends things I told her in confidence to not tell anyone. Things such as I cant talk to many people because of anxiety and that I had almost tried to kill myself. Then she started spreading lies like that I was trying ""too much"" with her and such. Then she got a new boyfriend who she would talk about all the time to me. She basically tried her best to make my life hell and isolate me. She would then talk to my face about how we are such good friends. She then told one of my friends who then told me about it ( true friend). I then ceased all conversation and interaction. Cut to a while later and she starts talking about how she is depressed because i wont talk to her. Every one thinks I'm silly to still hold a grudge.
