It just happened to be an abandoned all girl orphanage.
Now I know I sound like a white person in a horror movie. The reason I agreed to go was that I had no choice. My parents made me go during spring break. Also I was getting paid sooooo.


So we get there and the first thing I think of looking at this place is how much it looks like the Overlook Hotel from The Shining. The floors didn't have patterned carpet but it had bright red carpet. As I went into the death hotel I saw a 10 year old in a white tank top just staring. Staring with eyes that looked like they looked straight into my soul. The only thought going through my head was, "" Imma die here.""


So nothing interesting happens during the day. Just renovating stuff. That night we were eating dinner and the tv just turns on. The TV was really old and had no cable so it was just static. We just turned it off and thought nothing of it.


That night I struggle to go to sleep. I eventually do but I wake up at around 3:00 am. I feel the need to go to the bathroom so I begin to get up. As I am sitting on the bed about to stand I hear something that I will never forget. I hear the sound of two little girls laughing. My sister is 15 at the time and my grand mother is 74 so I know it can't be either of them. I then decide I really don't need to go to the bathroom and get back in bed. I hide under my blanket like the ghost will never break through my soft blue blanket.


Well nothing happened that night. We were to stay another day after that. I begged my grandmother to leave that day. She said no because we were doing God's work for the missionaries. So we get to work for the day.


Nothing interesting happens during the day. At night I start noticing little weird things. I would see little shadows for a second and them they would disappear. I heard what sounded like foot steps running. My Grandmother and sister didnt seem to notice anything out of the ordinary. I was freaking out.


That night I can barely sleep. I eventually manage to go to sleep but wake up at the same time as before. This time I wake up and see something i will never forget. It looks like a very pale little girl. The odd thing is that the girl does not look quite solid. I can somewhat see through her as if she was mist. She makes a motion for me to follow her and rums away. I get up and go to my door and look out at the hallway. I see that same girl running down the hall. Another girl joins her. Both motion to me to follow. I begin to take a step. Then I realize that there is no way that this would end good. I know this and yet I am taking steps to follow them. It is as if I have no self control. I then snap out of my trance and sprint back to my bed. I dont sleep any the rest of the night.


I wake up in the morning and I am ready to get out of there. My family packs up and I am outta there. I still think about what would happen if I had followed those girls. I am scared I would have ended up in that place forever.",nosleep,Renovating an abandoned all girl orphanage.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3r06ez/renovating_an_abandoned_all_girl_orphanage/

She was always mentioning how much she was into other guys (to her fucking boyfriend). It lasted about 6 months then she broke up with me. I was hurt because she was the only friend I had. I then just ended all contact. She then started spreading rumors about me because she was mad I wasn't talking to her. 


 A few years later I had gotten some friends and not thought about her for a while. Apparently that was not the case for her. She began texting my mother ( MY FUCKING MOTHER FOR CRYING OUT LOUD) and saying I was insulting her all the time ( I wasnt). Eventually my family forced me to start talking to her.


During this time I was depressed. I felt all alone. my other friends had all kinda just drifted away. So I began talking to her. She was always talking about how she wanted me back. I felt that I had no one so i went back. Like a dumbass I went back. Thinking back I consider myself to have been acting like drug addict going back to her like that. 

2 days into the relationship she starts talking about all the hardships she went through after she broke up with me. She said she tried to kill herself cause she wanted me back so much. She then starts to talk about how all of my somewhat friends ( i have trouble making friends due to anxiety) I talked to hated me. She said they wished I was dead. That shit hurt. Then to top it all off she said my mother always talked about how I was a disappointment. Hearing this almost put me over the edge. That night i almost tried to suicide. I had the razor blade and was just trying to gain courage to do it. I couldn't go through with it (obviously). 


cut to the next week. She then starts talking about how she still has feeling for her ex. I asked her why she still talked to him. She said she couldnt be mean because he has seizures ( oh bo fucking ho). i then start to get mad because last time we dated that stuff made me feel like shit. So then she gets mad at me for getting mad. i end the coversation. 

Cut to the next day. She was going to a football game ( her ex was a football player). We never really resolved the arguement. She then starts to talk to me like im stupid because i dont like football. i just ignore it. later she says she is going to Waffle house with her ex and his family. Of course this makes me mad. She then says that she feels like she is trapped in a corner ( Im guessing because I dont want her fucking her ex) so I tell her she is not trapped anymore and thats how i ended it. I cut all contact and left it at that.


Cut to a week later and she is already back with her ex and spreading lies about me. Just the week before she was talking about how the only reason she wasnt back with him was because he wasnt relationship material. She then starts to make it a point to flaunt him anytime I'm in the same vicinity or on facebook. She talked about how she was so much luckier to have him than me. She would make it a point to call my name then start almost fucking him in public. 
In a few days she starts texting my mother again because she is going through alot ( my ex). So my mom starts giving her words of encouragement. That brings us up to date. 

I cant fucking believe my ex is such a bitch. She does her best to make me feel like shit while dating. Then gets mad when I'm sad about it. I told her about me being sad and she went and told anyone who would listen. i cant believe my mother is being her friend. She does her best to try and make me hate myself and my mother still wants to talk to her. Soon she'll convince me whole family that Im being an asshole for not talking to her. Then the vicious cycle will start again. Im sick of this bullshit.",rant,My ex is driving me crazy,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/3onm9y/my_ex_is_driving_me_crazy/
