19,"I would say Hurk as a higher skill cap than Karok, but Hurk's damage is pretty crazy at the moment. Very easy to get top dps in raids. Pillar Karok is an easy to play hard to master type of skill cap. (I would say). Personally I love Karok, and he can still do a decent amount of damage. The pillar revamp they did for him a long time ago really helped him. I would say just hop on your Karok and get used the game. At least with pillar Karok you can actually mindlessly attack without having to memorize the attack patters of bosses. At least to an extent. Definitely not the newer bosses and it just isn't a viable mechanic to play around entirely, but you can still do it if you have no idea what you're doing. Just get to a point where you're getting back into it and then ask yourself if you feel like you're getting bored. If you are, it's time to go back to your powerhouse and practice some parries. Gameplay is all up to you. Maybe Karok will be more fun than Hurk. Or vise versa.",2015-07-26 20:01:30+00:00,ctgyw86,1,t3_3eosxj,1453,Vindictus
