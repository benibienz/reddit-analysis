87,"I honestly think that Riggers would look something like this:

Sunshield Rigger

When ~ enters the battlefield, Assemble. (place an artifact token called Contraption onto the battlefield. It has T: )

[assemble can go in a lot of places like Investigate]

When a contraption you control becomes tapped, you may pay WW. If you do, prevent all damage from any one source until end of turn.

This way, contraptions have a clear purpose: artifact tokens that interact with Riggers on the battlefield. Contraptions can then have multiple effects per tap with multiple Riggers. This mechanic also works in line with Steamflogger Boss, allowing us to double our basic contraptions- which could be useful. I feel like there's also design space for a sweet Legendary Rigger which interacts with your graveyard - either as a static zone or by exiling Riggers which are in your yard as a cost. Something like:

Legendary Rigger - RU3

When ~ enters the battlefield, you may exile up ton3 Riggers from your graveyard. If you do, ~ has the rules text of each of those Riggers. Assemble for each card Exiled in this way. 

OR

Riggergoyf - RU4

When ~ Enters the battlefield, assemble, then assemble. 

Riggergoyf has the rules text of each Rigger in your graveyard. 

The first line allows us to have something like 

Lightning Rigger - RR

When Lightning Rigger enters the battlefield, Assemble.

When a Contraption enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice it. If you do, Lightning Rigger deals 2 damage to target creature or player. 

And my personal favorite: 

Egg Rigger - GW1

When Egg Rigger enters the battlefield, you may pay 1. If you do, Assemble. 

When a contraption you control becomes tapped, you may pay 1. If you do, sacrifice that artifact and draw a card. 

(This design is particularly cute because it avoids [[Second Sunrise]] effects since contraptions are tokens.)

These designs encourage an environment where U control elements (tap effects) become relevant because you can tap an opponents Contraptions, forcing them to use or lose contraption activations. This also means that blue bounce removal is particularly effective as you can bounce a contraption to break it or you can bounce a Rigger to force activations/remove rules text from Contraptions temporarily. 

It also allows us to have things like this in standard: 

Leaky Rigger U1

Flash 

When Leaky rigger enters the battlefield, Assemble. 

When a contraption you control becomes tapped, you may pay U1. If you do, sacrifice it and counter target spell unless it's controller pays [this is where design gets weird. I want this to be similar to mana leak, but slightly less problematic. I want to template this something like: pays 3 generic OR two colored mana. This way, people who aren't playing Riggers can pay with their lands and pay a little less, and Rigger players can pay with their various mana contraptions.] 

The design intent here is to have a powerful counterspell which is over costed in total cost (UU2 is a lot) but gives potential counters. You can Flash in a Leaky rigger for a 4 mana Mana Leak, but you can also play a few of them earlier so your opponent sees you have 2-3 contraptions ready to turn into Mana Leaks. 

Anyway sorry for the wall of text. I've just been thinking about this for a while. Also this formatting is probably garbage since I did this on mobile. Maybe I'll make some custom cards and post them later. ",2016-06-27 15:46:38+00:00,d4pyb64,5.0,t1_d4p75od,56143.0,magicTCG

Also, a few artifacts which get effect from entry/exit like mycosynth wellspring/ichor wellspring. Perhaps Aether Wellspring would read enter: make a thopter and exit: make a thopter?

[[Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord]] combined with [[Centaur Vinecrasher]] is very potent. [[Psychosis Crawler]] kills your opponent slowly. [[Tireless Tracker]] gives you even more draw (if that's at all necessary). [[Terravore]] is a big daddy of a beater. [[Vulturous Zombie]] works well with the aforementioned stax strategy. Also, you can use Natural Affinity to animate enemy lands on an open board and force them to sac their lands with edict effects. Brutal. [[World Breaker]] is very cute with the amount of utility lands I'll be running.

291,"I know this sounds weird, and it's a little pedantic, but sexism is not a two way street. Sexism is a system of oppression which keeps women less powerful than men. 

You can't be sexist towards men. You can however be discriminatory, but you cannot be sexist. 

There are systems that target men oppressively, specifically things like child custody courts, which heavily favor the mother. However, in doing this, those places actually enforce cultural sexism by expecting mothers to be better parents regardless of the circumstances. 

To take your argument into account, most men aren't made uncomfortable by the sexualization of other men- I've never actually heard someone complain about it. This is because images of shirtless guys don't enforce a cultural system of dominance, especially in a game played by a lot of males. This is in stark contrast to images of scantily clad women in a game like this, because those sort of images directly enforce cultural sexism.

So your game plan pretty much revolves around Marath, and using his super versatile abilities to control the board, create tokens, and in conjunction with enchantments and a small suite of creatures, win the game. Almost every card in the deck (or every permanent) interacts with Marath favorably, either powering up tokens, or comboing to make him very big. I've won with this deck in a lot of ways - classic token overrun, craterhoof big daddy blowouts, commander damage (by abusing cathars crusade and hardened scales to make Marath huge) or just pinging people down with Marath.

489,"I've come to realize I really like variety in my decks though - 

Sydri hits my artifact itch and lets me play some weird combos that aren't that fast or strong, but can win some games. 

Ezuri is the king of value city, turning little buddies into huge threats and creating so much +1/+1 synergy.

Marath combines the two, making tokens, being fueled by enchantments and can both go infinite or win with overrun. 

The Keekster-Jeekster is a combo house, but goes about it in a different way than the others.

Meren just does big creatures that create value remarkably well. Plus I just draw a bunch of cards and fill up my graveyard. It won't be super competitive but I feel like it'll be a total blast to pilot. 

I think I want to do Shattergang stax though. ",2015-12-28 03:36:07+00:00,cydfw8g,4.0,t1_cydfnpw,443.0,EDH
490,"I didn't include Seize Control simply because it's a pretty complex archetype, and if you're buying a precon you're probably newer to the format - so I figured I'd avoid it. Also, there is the feeling that the deck is overpowered, and jumping in with a deck like that (and the feelings toward it) might push a player away from the game. The Marath precon is in a weird spot- it certainly works, although I think it works better with Mayael at the helm. However, both Mayael and Marath work better when a deck is really built around their abiltiies. Notably, Marath wants his counters/tokens to matter a lot more than they do in the precon, and Mayael wants big beaters (easy enough on the wallet) but also a Scroll Rack + Sensei's Divining Top to make the deck work a bit better.

Power Hungry (2013) - proshh is very strong. The deck is pretty good. Definitely a fun one. Room for upgrades, but expensive upgrades. 

Built from scratch (2014) - darreti and Feldon are both absolute houses. Great value in the box from certain staples (Wurmcoil engine and chaos warp together are 20 dollars. The deck is 25 on Amazon) plus upgrading can be pretty cheap due to mono color. 

Plunder the Graves / Swell the Host (2015) both of these decks are pretty strong out of the box, but certain upgrades can be very costly.

762,"I made a lengthy post about improving enhance specifically. I'll link it and copy/paste in a moment. 

Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3gqgw7/suggestion_how_to_improve_enhancement_shaman_in/


I've been playing Enhancement Shaman and Ret Paladin since my first time maxing in WotLK. As I've played, I've seen many classes get reworked and been witness to huge class changes, especially the addition of Monk, the combo point change, and the Warlock overhaul.

Even my ret paladin (as with all Paladins) has seen significant improvement in my eyes due to the addition of holy power. However, over the last few expansions Enhancement has been dragged through the mud and has lost a lot of class identity while being introduced over and over again to clunky mechanics that exacerbate rather than fix the issues they have.

I've been brainstorming for a few weeks ok hi enhancement could finally be straightened out and brought into the modern era of WoW. The main concepts I want to address here are totems, Maelstrom, and Searing Flames. The goal here is to make enhancement more active while removing passive/annoying/unwieldy mechanics. 

With that said, here's my new enhancement mechanic idea: *Maelstrom/Magma.* Think combo points/holy power combined with balance bar. 

5 points each (cannot exceed 5 points) in a split bar with strong aesthetic cues similar to the balance bar. 

For *Maelstrom* my goal is to remove it from the buff bar and give the player a bit more control. 

*Stormstrike* should do what it currently does, but always reward 2 maelstrom points. 

The current *Maelstrom* stacking mechanic can be kept (with a chance on auto attack based on attack speed to gain a stack) 

When you reach 5 *Maelstrom* points you can instantly cast any offensive or healing spell (This includes Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning *Elemental Blast*, and Healing Surge but NOT Astral Recall or Hex)

*Magma* points are a mechanic similar to Searing Flames with an emphasis on player control and with special attention paid to removing dated/annoying mechanics. 

*Lava Lash* grants one *Magma* point and applies *Magma Burn* 

*Magma Burn* is functionally identical to *Flame Shock*

50% chance on *Magma Burn* tick to add another *Magma* point.

At 5 *Magma* points your next *Lava Lash* hit does 100% more damage and the cool down is reset. 

If you reach both 5 *Magma* stacks and 5 *Maelstrom* stacks *Lightning Bolt* becomes *Magma Surge* and *Elemental Blast* becomes *Molten Blast* 

These spells are instant cast and do both 100% increased damage from their base spells (LB + LL/EB + LL) and have an additional 30% Crit chance. 

This removes the clunkiness of Flame Shock and Searing totem while updating the class to be more modern.

When I played 64 for the first time, I thought he was a Pokemon trainer and I had no idea why he had psychic powers. But I liked him,  so I played him. In Melee, I read some of his trophy text and one of my friends at school had a SNES and a copy of Earthbound that he lent to me. This is when the obsession started. In Brawl, Ness was back- with some weird blond kid. On playing Lucas, I immediately fell in love with him. My friends no longer complained due to PK Fire locking them up, and I could play a faster character. When I found out Mother 3 was never released in the US, I was crestfallen. When I heard about the fan translation, I immediately began playing it. Mother 3 has become one of my favorite games of all time. The characterization and general themes are so great, and the amount of hilarious fucked-up shit that happens never fails to make me smile. 

When I saw Lucas wasn't to be included in Smash 4, I was broken. I didn't know what to do. I went back to FE characters, but none of them felt great. I eventually made my way back to Ness. But then April 1st came around and everything changed. Now I'm back and working on Lucas, adjusting to a playstyle I haven't ever seriously tried. Smash 4 is also the first game in the series I've started playing competitively, and I'm in a great area for that. I'm hoping to win my first tournament next semester with Lucas in tow.

These are the stories we will tell
As I stood frozen 
Infinite, I almost fell
Well, I got a feeling 
And my heart starts beating
A sudden rush of feeling alive
This is freedom 
And I won't change I won't fade out

1009,"I responded to a comment about link specifically below, but I'm less familiar with Shulk and Robin. Regardless, I'll try to help- 
With Shulk, the speed of your aerials really hurts against these tactics. However, walling with nair and fair are probably your best option. The problem with ZSS is her projectile end lag is very short, so it's hard to punish her. Your best bet is power shielding or clanking it and looking for an opening. For Robin, your aerials are reasonably fast, but avoid using Levin sword charges to clank. Instead, respond to her short hops and flip kicks with nairs and weak fairs. Similarly with falcon, your best bet is to shield or short hop nair to stop yourself getting grabbed. Sadly, Robin's projectiles will be hard to land in either of these match ups - they're just difficult for the characters you main.

You might want to try Roy- he keeps the sword flavor you obviously like, with much more respectable speed and options. For something like Robin, you could try Pac-man  for a bit of weirdness, but Ness (while super high tier and hated) is very similar to Robin IMO but he doesn't have Robins ludicrously low speed / strong aerials.

1011,"ZSS is pretty annoying, I personally have a ton of trouble against her (esp. Since my buddy is very good at reading and conditioning me) I think that using Zairs to space against her could be very helpful. Does using crouch block her paralyzer? I'm not sure, but with his new grab length that could open up some punish options (although shield would probably work as well). 
Clanking her projectiles with arrows/boomerang may help a lot. Use link's strong and fast kill moves (side and up tilt come to mind) 
You really have to gauge how the individual plays with ZSS though, as some are much happier with using paralyzer than others. 

As for captain falcon, aggressive use of projectiles and using grabs and new down throw should work wonders. Also, links fair and nair might make falcon have some trouble. ",2015-06-16 13:41:28+00:00,cs8bvii,4.0,t1_cs8bmnc,506.0,smashbros

1013,"I'm on mobile, but are you a ness player? You should try using short hop/retreating nairs for spacing/safe movement. I had a similar problem until I realized how strong his other options were.
