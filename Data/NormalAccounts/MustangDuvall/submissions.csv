When Thrasios was spoiled, my head started spinning - card selection and ramp, in the command zone, on a merfolk body? I didn't think it could get better. I looked through my old decks to see if there was something that could be revitalized thanks to this commander, and then it hit me. My dune-brood nephilim deck, relegated to never be played due to a useless commander and iffy building, could be reimagined, with blue! For me though, blue doesn't mean counterspells- it means insane card selection and sweet, splashy spells. Thrasios represented everything I'd wanted in a landfall commander, and Tymna just allowed me to cherry pick a bit of card draw, which is always welcome. The deck evolved from that Dune-Brood list and my buddies Patron of the Moon deck, and has now evolved into a deck that plays every land-based combo I could think of - Titania and Armageddon. Scapeshift and Splendid Reclamation. Amulet of Vigor. Knight of the Reliquary and Retreat to Coralhelm. Prismatic Omen and Emeria Shepherd - all of these effects are rarely seen in my commander playgroup, and pulling out a deck that represents things that are not at all typical is really exciting for me. If you guys have comments or criticism, don't hesitate! I'm very excited to see what you guys like or dislike about this list.

For me, I'd change Dune-Brood to have some sort of evasion, possibly also based on the number of lands in play - for instance, if you have more lands in play than an opponent, Dune-Brood has menace/fear/etc. I would also add the ability to play an additional land on your turn. 

For Glint-Eye, I feel that its damage effect is strong enough for it to not have evasion. However, I feel that the discard should not have a mana cost associated, and if it does, it should add +1/+1 counters, so the ability actually scales (albeit slowly). 

Ink-Treader is perhaps TOO powerful, but I'm not quite sure how I would balance it. Perhaps give the copying some sort of mana cost to trigger? Perhaps: Whenever an instant or sorcery spell targets Ink-Treader Nephilim, you may pay RGUW: (should be in WUBRG order but the nephilim aren't...) If you do, copy that spell for each other creature that spell could target. Each copy targets a different one of those creatures.

Witch-Maw: This guy being all about +1/+1 counters is great. He's Abzan AND Simic. I feel like he could have something a bit stronger though?

Yore-Tiller: I feel like there should be some sort of prowess happening here. Like, Prowess and copy a spell from your graveyard. I think that's imba though. 

What do you guys think? How could the nephilim get upgraded or downgraded if shifted to legendary? ",EDH,"if you were to remake the nephilim as legendary creatures, how would you and why?",https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/4tfnsb/if_you_were_to_remake_the_nephilim_as_legendary/

Obviously the tuned Zur and Azusa decks at my table will probably be a bit more powerful, but I think this bug has a chance to go far.

I found I was getting summoned a ton more, and ended up with ~13 medals in 4 hours of playing (while also progressing!) however, I realized I peaked around SL40 with invasions. When I realized this peak, I did what any rational person would do: I just stopped leveling up. Through Deacons of the Deep, Wolnir, and Pontiff, I didn't level up once past SL40. Naturally, I acquired a massive pile of souls and started getting very nervous about losing them. Once I reached Anor Londo, I decided I'd farm up the rest of my Proofs at the Silver Knights, cause I only needed 6. This took forever, but between my Silver Serpent Ring and my Mimic Hat, I ended up accruing about 600k souls. 

I just turned in 30 proofs and got my miracle, and I leveled up from SL40 to SL70 in one go.

However, I really like Golgari colors for a lot of things, so I'm pretty interested in both Jarad and Glissa, the Traitor. 

Jarad decklists are something I know very well and I'd be happy to build one eventually, but I'd really love to build a third B/G list which is more focused on artifacts, since it's an interesting theme and opens the stax direction since most of the best stax effects are on artifacts (although some are in black, go figure). 

What I'm wondering is: how do people build Glissa competitively? Most of the lists I've seen are pretty outdated, and I'm trying to adapt two of them into one big list at the moment, but I'm not sure if they idea is strong enough. I pretty much want to be playing stax with a combo finish, inspired by modern Second Sunrise (eggs + Creeping Renaissance + Codex Shredder) to build storm count and tendrils someone to death, or cast a big Bitter Ordeal. 

Do people think this is a strong idea? I've got a preliminary decklist here:

While I love the Toad, I don't know how effective he is as a stax commander because his ability requires us to sac lands, which keeps us relatively close to our opponents rather than creating incremental value. I do appreciate the insane amount of card draw and I'm going to keep working with him, however, I recently re-discovered Glissa in my binder, and realized that I could play a very similar deck with Glissa, but have a focus on artifacts (which also are super important to the stax gameplan). 

I'm also a combo player at heart, and I've always had a soft spot for long, drawn out shit like Four Horsemen and Eggs/Second Sunrise. Since those combos are banned in their relevant formats, I'm relegated to trying to make them work in singleton and annoying my friends. 

So anyway, the concept of the deck: I want to play a stax deck that proceeds to combo out while abusing a traditional stax package (http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/commander-edh/204260-the-stax-primer) and a suite of eggs as inspired by Darcykun's *Snake Eggs* primer (http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/commander-edh/multiplayer-commander-decklists/490203-glissa-snake-eggs) 

The idea will be to play a very small amount of creatures, and a huge suite of cheap artifacts which replace themselves, and end the game with a few combos:

First: Ad Nauseam. This card is super well known as being an insane combo engine which allows us to draw a disgusting amount of cards. In this case, we'll be drawing into artifact synergies and eggs which allow us to create a lot of mana and draw a lot of cards. Creeping Renaissance helps us on this goal. We can finish off with a Tendrils Storm or even a strong Bitter Ordeal Gravestorm as a backup plan. If this plan is derailed, our next best option is to mill ourselves with a cute little combination of Basalt Monolith and Mesmeric Orb, milling our entire deck, Shuffling Dread into our library, activating Flashback on Dread Return, returning either Eternal Witness or Lord of Extinction (dependent on if there is a Torpor Orb in play, might be ours). Eternal Witness gets Victimize back, we cast Victimize to get Jarad and Lord of Extinction onto the battlefield, sac Lord of Extinction to Jarad to kill the table. If we Dread Return Lord of Extinction we activate Jarad and hardcast him to end in the same way.

So I'm working on making this list a reality, which is proving to be a lot of fun as I get to play a lot of janky cards/sweet Eggs tech, but I'm wondering if people think this deck will work in a competitive metagame? Obviously the deck will be very weak to graveyard hate, but I'm not expecting to win every game - just to be able to take some games away. 

EDIT: Here's the primary draft for a decklist - I'm obviously a few cards over and I need to add a bit of tutoring/instants to the deck, but it's what I've got so far.

People were constantly commenting the deck, talking about how sweet it was and generally super excited about the deck I'd made.

I decided to go stax with the Gitrog Monster, using his ability to generate value and dig for combo pieces as I worked towards a win. I came away extremely satisfied with nearly every card in my deck, and just generally super excited by the monster and his abilities.

I'd like to share my decklist and ask people for their opinions on a few things -

Can I turn this into a Hermit Druid combo deck without hurting my colored mana sources too much? Hermit druid - flip library - dread return Lord of Extinction, sac to Jarad to win the game? It seems very strong, but I don't know if there's space or enough lands that won't mess me up in just two colors. 

I also want to try to find space for [[Deathrite Shaman]] [[Entomb]] and [[Dread Return]] regardless. Also, just general ideas of what you think seems strong or weak would be sweet.

I started with a skitarii start collecting box but quickly got frustrated with the fragility of my units compared to space marines/wolves and tau battlesuits. On researching, I discovered the Salamanders and fell in love with their tactics, fluff, and looks - so I've decided to go with Salamanders as my main list. However, I realized that starting off with a 2000 point list of just marines was going to get boring for me, and didn't allow for a ton of room to experiment. So I decided to run ~1200 points of Salamanders and ~800 points of bikers (I eventually decided on a Ravenwing formation). I quickly realized that playing with a set of allies was a lot of fun for me as it let me experiment with different models and playstyles. On that note, I think I want to build into two more allied detachments for my Salamanders - one Cult Mechanicus w/ the Kastelan Robot + Techpriest Dominus formation and one IG Psykana formalin backed up by a blob of Guardsmen infantry and a few squads of Tempestus Scions. 

This should allow me to go for all-out blitz games with bikers, long games with powerful MCs with Robots, and games where I've got to throw squad after squad at my enemies with guard, plus some psyking.

While playing the deck was fun, I became frustrated due to a lack of options and a suite of sub-par creatures (particularly [[Mistblade Shinobi]] and [[Zephyr Sprite]] - I decided that I wanted more of modern, so I bought into a 2-color manabase and replaced those weaker creatures with some [[Bitterblossom]] and some black removal. 

This decklist is the culmination of those efforts, and I'm very happy with how it turned out. However, I'm wondering what other people think of it - What can I improve? Is there anything I'm missing that's obvious? I'd like to improve this list over a few months once I get a bit more in terms of budget, perhaps including a few honorary faerie [[Snapcaster Mage]].

I currently have a few very tuned decks, then a badly tuned Sydri deck which can still go infinite. I want BIG GREEN to be a deck that plays with classic green stuff and drops the classic big effects of green. I want to warp the color pie a little bit by running Yeva as one of the commander options (more on that in a second) and running Cloudstone Curio and Conjurer's Closet to get a bit more value out of these cards.

The goal of this deck is to have multiple possible commanders, all of which work in the 99 of the deck as well. 

[[Omnath, Locus of Mana]] - The biggest and greenest of them all. Great for new players and old timmys alike. 

[[Nemata, Grove Guardian]] - This deck doesn't really like tokens that much, so she might get cut - but green and tokens go together like peanut butter and jelly. 

[[Kamahl, Fist of Krosa]] - This guy's a lot like Ezuri, but he puts lands to work and hits more than elves with his overrun. He makes for a more interactive playstyle, since his first ability can be used to blow up people's lands when a board wipe comes out. THINGS MIGHT GET POLITICAL 

[[Polukranos, World Eater]] - Things will not get political. Things will get eaten. By Polukranos. 

[[Freyalise, Llanowar's Fury]] - While by no means an all-star, Freyalise is a work horse of a commander who makes mana, kills problem permanents and can possibly draw some cards. The original draft of the deck that I'm playing right now is also about half of her precon, so I feel like she deserves a spot. 

However, I need to cut 14 cards - the problem here is that I'm really in love with most of these cards, so I'm having a lot of trouble cutting. If anyone has any ideas for what to cut, let me know. Decklist here: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/aww-yeva/

Between the 10-20 people I play with, different decks and deckbuilders obviously have different philosophies. 

Across these different philosophies and players, power levels of decks differ vastly. Therefore, after playing a game with my weakest EDH deck against an unmodified precon, I decided it was time for me to actually change something up. My five-or-so (bits of Kiki and Meren are still in the mail/waiting to be ordered) EDH decks are all pretty ruthlessly tuned - I enjoy playing most when I'm at a table of people who are at each other's throats, and it's a race of good play vs. counterplay. However, that's reflected in my decks- lots of answers, and lots of difficult to answer threats run abundant throughout my deck. I'm trying to solve this by crafting a single deck. I call it BIG GREEN. 

BIG GREEN is a mono-green deck which has a few powerful interactions, but in general is a green goodstuff deck. Green is good at very basic magic - ramping, casting creatures, and sometimes removing problem non-creature permanents (aside from Beast Within and Terastodon). I wanted to make a deck that, due to its simplistic and straightforward nature is easy to pilot for a beginner-level player, but demonstrates the unique format of EDH by showing off big creatures and huge pseudo-combos. 

I also want this deck to feel accessible to all types of player, since I like to lend my decks out. I want to accomplish this by having a few possible commanders:

[[Yeva, Nature's Herald]] - This is my commander of choice, as a player who likes doing stuff at instant speed and being able to respond, one of the issues with green. However, Yeva's power is lost on a new player and can prove confusing, so I'd like to slot her out when necessary. 

[[Ezuri, Renegade Leader]] - This guy's freakin' famous. He got rekt by phyrexian oil and now he's on the cover of a big ol commander precon with added blue, and he's a wincon in a pretty cool modern deck. People know Ezuri. Also, this is green. So there are some elves. 

[[Dwynen, Gilt-Leaf Daen]] - Here's a somewhat boring Elf lord with a life gain subtheme. I don't know if anyone would ever pick this as the commander, but she's in the deck due to her lord powers. 

[[Kamahl, Fist of Krosa]] - This guy's a lot like Ezuri, but he puts lands to work and hits more than elves with his overrun. He makes for a more interactive playstyle, since his first ability can be used to blow up people's lands when a board wipe comes out. THINGS MIGHT GET POLITICAL 

[[Polukranos, World Eater]] - Things will not get political. Things will get eaten. By Polukranos. 

[[Nissa, Vastwood Seer]] - You like ramp? You like planeswalkers? GOOD! Here's a rampin' planewalker creature thing.

[[Freyalise, Llanowar's Fury]] - While by no means an all-star, Freyalise is a work horse of a commander who makes mana, kills problem permanents and can possibly draw some cards. The original draft of the deck that I'm playing right now is also about half of her precon, so I feel like she deserves a spot. 

So, those are the pick of the commanders - what about the deck? 

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/aww-yeva/

Currently, this tappedout decklist is a bit of a mess as I've got 26 cards too many (so I'll need to do some cuts). Right now there's a functional 100 card deck on my desk that is an embodiment of the deck concept, but I'd like to add some bigger splashier effects plus some cool little things for people to figure out. The maybeboard is a list of cards that will probably get the axe when I get the new, better cards but are currently in the deck. 

Anyway, I was wondering what people thought of the deck concept - the modular generals, the mess of a list, and maybe any suggestions?

I like big things, stompy creatures and general insanity in my games. However, I've started playing modern with a U/W Tempered Steel list (courtesy of SaffronOlive's Budget Modern series). 

However, one thing I've always loved about EDH was the amount of brewing that went into all my lists, how even my most competitive decks were really my own- so getting into a 60-card format is difficult for me because I don't feel like a special snowflake (I know, I know). 

One of my favorite things in magic is that enigmatic permanent - the +1/+1 counter. Playing with these things is always a joy for me, and I really want to find a way to make a modern deck that I can jam with my buddies and maybe win a few games. When the new Nissa was spoiled, I was really excited by the splash such a low costed card could make in 60-card decks. I know a deck that runs Nissa and Hardened scales should probably go to standard, but I really hate the idea that I'll only have six months to play with my cool deck. 

So here I am - I want to build a Jund Hardened Scales aggro/value deck. 

The only problem is, I have no idea how to build a modern deck - I know I have to fill my sideboard with meta-appropriate hate, and that my deck has to be pretty efficient. I've looked at a bunch of cards that interact with +1/+1 counters while remaining low cost, and I've especially paid attention to cards that say ""answer this or die"" so I can have a lot of small threats that end up huge, if they can't be answered. 

I'm not looking to make a competitive deck here, just a rogue build with potential for blowouts. 

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/spoilers-nissa-hardened-scales/

There's my current decklist. I recognize that there are a few problems with it, mainly the fact that I have no idea how many of each card I should be running and that I don't understand modern land bases. 

Is there any way someone much more knowledgeable than I could help me out? I'd really like to make this work.

TL;DR: Modern noob wants to build a deck, no idea where to start.

Okay, this deck is bonkers fun. I love that pretty much every single card does something in conjunction with just Marath and some extra mana - it's super weak to strategies that kill Marath on entry or hose him with a [[Pithing Needle]] but it's still very strong and can come back from those effects.

I think I need to tech in a [[Krosan Grip]] just so I have an instant-speed answer to problem enchantments/artifacts when I don't have [[Aura Shards]] on the field.

This deck plays pretty much exactly how I wanted it to! Every time I draw a creature I'm happy to see it (with the exception of [[Ogre Battledriver]] sometimes - I just wish it were [[In the Web of War]] most of the time. I'd rather have it as an enchantment. Probable cut.) 

I comboed out very hard in two games last night but misplayed and lost the second one. However, I feel like I could do pretty well with a token beatdown kill as well, although that's sometimes harder to put together. 

I think I might want to add a few Theros gods. Maybe Nylea, Heliod, and Iroas? All of them make my creatures stronger, and they're both enchantments and creatures! That means I can [[Evolutionary Leap]] a token into them! Awesome. 

I've updated my maybeboard with some stuff I'm kind of interested in. I'm especially excited about the [[Brave the Sands]] / [[High Ground]] effects. Multi blocks breakin da rules. 

Anyway, It's getting late but I'll work on this more tomorrow. 

I'd also like to add the Siege cycle from FRF and the Honden cycle, just because I think the Sieges are versatile and fun (if a bit weak) and the Hondens are just super cool.

I know Ezuri absolutely loves creatures, but I feel like 38 creatures is just too much. I'm just having a ton of trouble cutting creatures for answers. For instance, I decided to grab [[Mwonvuli Acid-Moss]] instead of [[Solemn Simulacrum]], just because the Moss creates an even bigger tempo swing, and the draw from Solemn isn't as worth it to me, in this deck. I also feel like I need some kind of spot removal - outside of [[Triskelion]] damage, I can't really remove creatures. I'm thinking specifically of [[Pongify]] and/or [[Rapid Hybridization]]. I'm also somewhat interested in [[Winged Coatl]] as a double-up in that regard. However, it might be better to run a [[Reality Shift]] since exile effects are generally stronger. 

Here's my list - the Maybeboard section includes cards I'm thinking about adding. Let me know what you think, and what I can cut for these things.

Defender, Lifelink

Janri, Thousand Hands can block any number of creatures.

When blocking, Janri, Thousand Hands can exchange power with one target attacking creature.

I sort of wish there was a way to assign excess damage from blocking as damage from the card, so I could turn around a huge creature and bonk for lethal commander damage. Also, I'd like some way to conditionally give the creature first strike so it could survive bigger hits. 

This card is designed around [The Thousand Armed Bodhisattva](http://www.buddhamuseum.com/wood-buddha/thousand-armed-kuanyin_63.jpg)

It's a mixed netdeck/homebrew from the professor's treefolk tribal video, and some of my own stuff. What I'm having trouble with is the gameplay- I've won 4 multiplayer games (2 from [[Worldslayer]] infinite lock, 2 from infect [[Triumph of the Hordes]].) I can justify infect - under most circumstances, a majority-treefolk deck will not win with beaters. However, Worldslayer illicits a groan every time it's dropped, and it's really not fun for anyone. This has made me examine my decklist from the ground up, and I'm trying to find out how to improve the deck in terms of gameplay for myself and for the rest of my table. 



Worldslayer lock is gonna be fixed by teching it out for a [[Druids Deliverance]], so I can populate [[Timber Protector]]. This is a similar lock, but it can be dealt with and it doesn't absolutely destroy most people's chances to continue playing the game. 

Otherwise, I think I need more draw effects, or a way to shape my hand better. On that note, my maybeboard has a ton of options for draw. Chiefly, I'm really interested in tossing in a few small things - first, trading my basics for Snowlands and tossing in a [[Scrying Sheets]], [[Ohran Viper]], and [[Gutless Ghoul]]. This snow theme works with my revealing/topdecking theme, and it doesn't change much. It just gives me the possibility to move a bit faster, if I'm lucky. On that note, [[Sylvan Library]] (possibly in combination with [[Abundance]] gives me the ability to have near absolute control over what I draw. It's also pretty expensive though, so that combo may wait for a bit. 

Otherwise, I'd like to get more creatures that do what my instants/sorceries do, but I want to stay in the forest theme. Bonus points for Fungus, Treefolk, and Elementals. Perhaps a reliable way to create Saprolings for mana.

Recently my roommates and I cracked a few boxes, and drafted decks for the first time in a long time. The hype got me full throttle. I've been exploring so much and I'm totally fascinated by the EDH format. I've chosen a commander in Sen Triplets, and I want to make an esper deck that's less about straight up winning and more about controlling the pace of the game, forging ties and creating alliances on the board. With that in mind, I realize that while I'll make friends on the board I'll also be making enemies, so I want a deck that'll protect me, my commander, and my artifacts while providing traditional esper control along with the ability to buff ""teammates"" directly and support them indirectly with instants. 

My questions are: 
Is this a good deck concept?
How should I approach the commander style?
How should I get started? (Obviously buy my commander, but perhaps the 2013 B/W/U commander box to get some staples (especially the diverse multicolor lands for commander?)
And any other helpful tips would be hugely appreciated. 

EDIT: I recognize that Sen's are seen as somewhat of a multiplayer powerhouse, I want to lower that power a bit in exchange for the ability to play table politics. I'll probably be targeted by the people who don't like control, but in turn the people benefitting from that control might pay me back.

As I've played, I've seen many classes get reworked and been witness to huge class changes, especially the addition of Monk, the combo point change, and the Warlock overhaul.

Even my ret paladin (as with all Paladins) has seen significant improvement in my eyes due to the addition of holy power. However, over the last few expansions Enhancement has been dragged through the mud and has lost a lot of class identity while being introduced over and over again to clunky mechanics that exacerbate rather than fix the issues they have.

I've been brainstorming for a few weeks ok hi enhancement could finally be straightened out and brought into the modern era of WoW. The main concepts I want to address here are totems, Maelstrom, and Searing Flames. The goal here is to make enhancement more active while removing passive/annoying/unwieldy mechanics. 

With that said, here's my new enhancement mechanic idea: *Maelstrom/Magma.* Think combo points/holy power combined with balance bar. 

5 points each (cannot exceed 5 points) in a split bar with strong aesthetic cues similar to the balance bar. 

For *Maelstrom* my goal is to remove it from the buff bar and give the player a bit more control. 

*Stormstrike* should do what it currently does, but always reward 2 maelstrom points. 

The current *Maelstrom* stacking mechanic can be kept (with a chance on auto attack based on attack speed to gain a stack) 

When you reach 5 *Maelstrom* points you can instantly cast any offensive or healing spell (This includes Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning *Elemental Blast*, and Healing Surge but NOT Astral Recall or Hex)

*Magma* points are a mechanic similar to Searing Flames with an emphasis on player control and with special attention paid to removing dated/annoying mechanics. 

*Lava Lash* grants one *Magma* point and applies *Magma Burn* 

*Magma Burn* is functionally identical to *Flame Shock*

50% chance on *Magma Burn* tick to add another *Magma* point.

At 5 *Magma* points your next *Lava Lash* hit does 100% more damage and the cool down is reset. 

If you reach both 5 *Magma* stacks and 5 *Maelstrom* stacks *Lightning Bolt* becomes *Magma Surge* and *Elemental Blast* becomes *Molten Blast* 

These spells are instant cast and do both 100% increased damage from their base spells (LB + LL/EB + LL) and have an additional 30% Crit chance. 

This removes the clunkiness of Flame Shock and Searing totem while updating the class to be more modern.

It's almost never useful, and unlike all the other totems, its value doesn't increase the longer it's out. 

I was talking to a friend about this, and realized searing totem could be changed to be a pseudo-Ragnaros to give it a bit more value, along with the new totem synergy cards. 

Imagine this.

Searing Totem 1/1 
Cannot attack.
At the end of your turn, this totem inflicts it's attack value to the closest enemy target. 

Similar to Ragnaros, this totem would attack indirectly, doing as much damage as Mage ping. However, the target would be slightly less random. If there is a minion directly across from the totem, it would do 1 damage (or more based on buffs) at the end of the turn. If it was between two minions, 50/50 chance to attack one or the other. On an empty board it would hit face. This would make the totem slightly worse in one way but marginally better in others as it could actually be used without throwing it back into the RNG pool for shaman hero power. Plus, it would introduce a new unique mechanic.

I've looked at your comments, and posted a revised version of the idea on the official forums. My original post is below, and I'm pasting my post on the forums here for your reading convenience.

I was actually talking about this with a friend last night- I like the idea in the OP, but I was thinking something that maintains the flavor of Akkhans while also allowing us to mix-and-match builds like WW/IK Barbs and other classes can.


My idea goes like this.

(2) Set:
Reduce the Wrath Cost of all abilities by 50% while Akarat's Champion is active.


(4) Set:
Reduce the cooldown of Akarat's Champion by 50% OR Damaging attacks lower the active cooldown of Akarat's Champion by 2 seconds (From the OP)

(6) Set
Akarat's Champion gains the effect of every rune.



The other change to the set I would make would be a different one: adding two pieces to Akkhan's set.



Akkhan's Knuckle Ring:
Guaranteed Socket, Guaranteed CDR Roll

Akkhan's Shield Wall
Guaranteed Crit Roll



Why should these items be added?

As it stands, Akkhan's is simply outclassed by Roland's, and will be outclassed by the new Hammerdin set. However, with the suggested set bonus change above, Akkhan's may be somewhat competitive- people may want to pursue the new 6 set and build around it. However, rather than making Akkhan's strictly better than Roland's or Hammerdin, the addition of two more set pieces would make the Akkhan's set parallel to Zuni's and Nat's- the strange offset pieces serve to balance the overall power of the set, and more importantly they open the possibility to combine sets:

Imagine your paper doll, set up with Roland's Helm, Chest, Gloves, Legs, and Boots.
In your shoulder slot, Akkhan's shoulders. Akkhan's Ring and Shield are at your side, and RoRG is either cubed or equipped as well. With this setup, you have access to Roland's 6 set and Akkhan's new perma-Akarat, providing a nice damage and survivability boost to a set that already feels good.

The addition of the Ring and Shield are very purposeful - they serve to limit the overall power of the set.

The Ring will stop crusaders from gaining the bonus of Focus + Restraint if they want to use Perma-Akarat + Hammers or Rolands, and the Shield will stop us from getting too much power from the Cube with those combination builds, as the Cube weapon slot will have to be used for Denial or Piro, limiting the power of those builds and keeping them at a healthy level.

The Ring also pushes crusaders away from F+R, which makes sense as our generators are boring and mostly useless due to the other ways we can gain Wrath.

What do you guys think?

----OLD POST----

I've been a Crusader player since 2.1 - I really enjoyed the flavor of the class and chasing after the shotgun flail is still a quest of mine.

However, in the time since 2.1 Akkhans has become overshadowed by Rolands set, and while this is sort of how the game goes I think Crusaders are in desperate need of build diversity as far as items go. Often in most builds there are de facto BEST items for each individual slot with very little wiggle room. Most endgame builds are dominated by full sets, and using partial pieces of sets doesn't work. Why is this? It's because both endgame-viable Crusader sets are 6 sets. While this seems reasonable, consider that Akkhans is the only set in this game which has a +500 main stat 2 set. So how do we fix this?

I think Akkhans should be a four set. And it should have TWO extra pieces added. 

Why? This set is problematic for a single reason: the Prophet rune. This rune allows a cheat death effect every 20 seconds, which is absurdly powerful for a class that already has a cheat death effect- I suggest that prophet is either replaced with something else or the ICD is increased. 

The set pieces that I think should be added are also important- I think a Crusader Shield and a Ring should be added. This is due to the over-centralization of F+R builds and how F+R builds feel on crusaders. Many crusader builds can exist without a generator, but due to F+R some people feel forced to run them. If a shield were added (To be honest, Akarat's Awakening could be changed to the set shield - its legendary effect is not very good.) along with a ring, Crusaders could use Akk Ring + Akk Shield + Akk off piece in order to get Perma-champion, making up some of the lost damage by not running F+R, while also running Rolands or Lights pieces in 2.3 - This would promote build diversity and also make a very cool set available for endgame play again. I would love to see the kind of builds people come up with (Firestarter with Rolands Sweep? and many more possibilities.)
