6,"No, its not pay to pay. Mumbo set this server up as a reward for those supporting him on Patreon. Which means if you are supporting him at the $10 tier you will have the privilege of being whitelisted. If he opened up the server to anyone, thousands of people would end up breaking the rules.",2015-08-17 13:02:58+00:00,cu5tl2f,1,t3_3hb6p2,425,MumboJumboFanServer
7,"I think I know what you're trying to get at and it sounds cool, as I said maybe stock up on the food first and then we'll just inform everyone if we are cutting down on the community farms.",2015-08-14 21:42:25+00:00,cu39jo7,4,t1_cu2xl6u,18026,MumboJumboFanServer
8,"I think we'd be better to plan the underground routes in a cross cross fashion, maybe a station at each bearing. (Ie: N,S,E,W) I like the idea of reducing the farms but maybe leave it until we have some larger/automatic farms so we can get food for the new people in September.

11,"It may be a good idea which would have to be planned, however... We must remember that in the future people are going to be making Nether hubs (at spawn and the town) So I'd say we need at least a 30 block buffer before we start to build.

14,"OK from a mods point of view, I am giving you permission to remove the shop and leave all the materials in a chest. I am sure the shop owner did not intend to annoy anyone but sometimes people don't see it as a bad thing. If anyone has a problem with you taking it down then let me know :)",2015-08-13 16:38:14+00:00,cu1qc7u,1,t3_3guexb,13457,MumboJumboFanServer

16,Had the chest got a sign which states the project you are working on?  Try to also let them know what sort of blocks you will need for the project :),2015-08-12 15:25:22+00:00,cu0g0gy,1,t3_3gngfu,60461,MumboJumboFanServer
17,"Feel free to fill it in (Probably best just the top layer) and leave a sign letting them know why it's been filled in. if they have any problems with it, they can come to us.. But I am sure they won't :P",2015-08-12 15:22:17+00:00,cu0fw4l,1,t3_3gob6t,46013,MumboJumboFanServer

21,"You have to remember that this is a new server and we're still in the process of finding the best solution. There are many views we have to take in to try and find a punishment that is fair. To be honest. Most of this probably happened before coreprotect started logging blocks, so now we can CLEARLY see who has put what where etc...",2015-08-11 16:08:07+00:00,ctz9gd4,1,t3_3ggqkl,94451,MumboJumboFanServer

23,"If something has been taken from YOUR chest without your permission, then its seen as stealing. Of person A did not give Person B permission to take the 22 diamonds then yes, it will count as a greif, but we'll do our best to keep it as private as possible to keep a positive vibe on the server.

24,"After reading all your comments, I am on two sides. Yeah... It would be better of the map wasn't full of holes, but on the other hand... It just requires a little consideration and kindness to fix your own, and even other people's creeper holes. There are not direct ways we can see who made a creeper blow up, but coreprotect can identify other evidence which may lead to the punishment of others. For example, people clicking on chests and doors is logged so watch out!",2015-08-11 15:49:57+00:00,ctz8qif,1,t3_3gkcfo,32030,MumboJumboFanServer
