Even if it takes 10 hits to break a block. xD

So, Regarding the lag... 
We are currently in the process of troubleshooting this issue. Our CPU has been constantly running at 100% which is probably caused by the 70 people constantly exploring new terrain. This should hopefully (Fingers crossed) fix itself over the next couple of days.

We will also be transferring our server to Spigot 1.8 tonight which is good news as it allows us to operate Bukkit plugins, such as Permissions and Coreprotect. Basically, We'll soon be able to track ALL chest/doors/block transactions and changes.
So if you steal, we'll have the evidence to support it... so DON'T :)

Regarding the map itself... We have now started up the brand new Spawn Town which can be accessed by visiting the nether and following the signs! Cords are: ~ (X: -1700 Z: -2300)
Please do not build in the original spawn chunks as we are trying to reduce the amount of entities around there to slow down the LAG.

If you're new...
First of all... Welcome to the server, If you have any questions then don't hesitate to ask one of our friendly mods (We don't bite) xD

Be sure to jump straight into the portal and head to the spawn town. There you'll be able to punch some trees and select some land at the Town to build your first home.


Thanks everyone for being so patient so far. We understand the block lag is unbearable and that there are a lot of unanswered questions, which is hopefully not the case any more now that I have written this thread but we'll get there!

In this post I am going to leave some of my own ideas and advice which I hope that most people take into account.

For starters... Lets not rush into building the biggest home or building closest to spawn. We need to remember that there will be 400 players on the server and chucking down 400 homes into one area of land will cause horrible lag. I've already seen posts here suggesting that we create multiple towns... Or maybe have guidelines for the size of house you can build etc... So until further notice, i'd suggest sticking to a hole in the ground :P

Another suggestion may be that we have the spawn chunks limited to ONLY an iron titan and welcome centre. I say this because the spawn chunks are ALWAYS loaded so hundreds of structures and farms in the spawn chunks would simply fry the server.

Finally, respect other peoples space! I understand that in the towns we will have builds very close together, but when building in the over-world make sure you leave at least 50-100 blocks since they will likely be planning on expansion.

I'm no mod or instructor so these rules are not official, but as I have already said... Please take them into account so we dont bust the server in the first few days!

See you around,

For those of you who know me well, Around November time, I took a few months away from the server to go and play at xBCrafted's Patreon. I unfortunately had to quit that due to my funds being low. I knew I wanted to stay on one Patreon server since the community here is so awesome! 

Anyway, trying to upgrade my system and being a Patreon is very hard on my income and a Paper Round isn't doing it for me... So I have no option but to discontinue my pledges. 

I have also had an incident at school where my YouTube channel was found so I have had to privatize all my videos as playing Minecraft seems to be an ""uncool"" thing and I've seen people in the past being bullied for it.

I do ask that you guys leave my stuff as if things improve as I may be back in the future.
Thanks everyone for making this an awesome year (and 25 days)
It's HONESTLY been the best year of my life In real life &amp; my virtual life.

Hopefully see you guys round some time on the YouTubes etc :)
