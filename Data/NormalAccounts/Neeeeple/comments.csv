1,"Different players have different mechanical capabilities and this adds an extra consideration or 10 to the decisions you already have to make.

Can I take this fight based on how he aims with the gun I think he will use, should I go for this item knowing he has picked up this gun he is insanely good with, should I be denying X weapon from him this game knowing that he usually destroys me with it, can I go here now that I've seen he can pull off this movement trick to fight me here easily?

At least in games like Quake Live, the decision making is arguably more important than the mechanics, but they play an excellent role in distinguishing players and giving them more to think about

I play aim based players very differently to ones that I know have excellent map control and decision making, but in both games I have shit loads to consider and those things are completely different based on the fact that these opponents have very different skillsets.

3,"&gt; Console exclusives (im looking at last of us, uncharted, become human, heavy rain) are more story based, while pc ones are more gameplay based.

I'd agree with this when considering AAA games. Though there are lots of PC exclusive indie titles. Could be to do with the fact that PC peripherals are well suited for gameplay whereas a controller can be quite limiting, making story games the best thing to use them for.

&gt; but for me it's less stressful and offers more than enough for gaming

Then a console is defintely suited to you. I wasnt trying to say ""PC is better than console"" with that comment. Just that unless you have specific console exclusives you want, then PC will offer the largest number games.

12,"Multiplayer

Video games are a great platform for competition. Especially 1v1 games like Quake and Starcraft. I cant get the same rush that I get from an intensely close Quake duel in any single player game because my opponent in a single player game is the game itself

Theres no egos on the line, no stakes, no relevant history between you and the computer, but with a real opponent you know who they are, or you at least know they are another thinking human like yourself and the thrill you get from trying to win is pretty great

A single player game is tailored to be do-able by its creators. They could have made a game you arent capable of completing by making the requirements superhuman, but they didnt and as weird as it sounds, that takes some of the fun out of competing against a game for me. I'm not competiting against the best that it can be, I'm competiting against something tailored to my ability

When I'm playing against a real opponent and I know we both want to win, we are both playing the best game we can play

With a single player game, you can exploit the engine or the bots if you learn how, but doing that to a person is a lot more difficult, it takes mind games, planning, tricking, trapping, confusing them. Youre trying to outsmart another person who can learn and adapt and who thinks like you, rather than a bot with fixed limitations and functions

In my eyes its the difference between batting against one of those machines that fires baseballs for practice and batting against a real bowler who wants to get you out.

Of course if competition isnt what youre after then none of this would or should matter to you, but if it its what you want out of gaming then multiplayer delivers it in spades if you pick the right game",2016-11-17 15:33:03+00:00,da4a05h,1.0,t3_5deiu4,30283.0,truegaming

* 4/5 abilities

* ultimates that can be so devestating they dictate the pace of the game

* auto attacks (a single repeating attack that isnt an activated abilitiy)

Quake Champions combat:

* one abiltiy

* no ultimates

* no auto attacks

* 8 or so weapons available to all players as map pickups

* skil based movement

* secret shops

* economy

* levelling up per game

* roshan/dragon or whatever its called

* isometric view

When people compared Overwatch to a moba that made sense from a combat persective. Both have a list of activated abilties per character and an ultimate, and aside from that your only other choice of combat was an auto attack/single weapon.

You cant make the same comparison with what we know about Quake Champions. Not in terms of combat and not in terms of the gameplay style, objectives or mechanics.

62,"People arent as competitive as they want to think they are it seems. People want a game that seems competitive, but is actually very kind and forgiving and gentle on their self confidence. Games like Overwatch giving you kills when you barely assisted, or giving you abilities that aim for you so that in low level games, anyone can get a kill as long as they get their ult. Games like CSGO where the TTK is so fast that anyone can get at least a couple of kills if they catch someone off gaurd. Team mates to blame or to carry them are a big factor too. Then on top of that they are stuffed full of loot crates, weapon drops and XP points to keep them hooked. 

It seems to be human nature. Took me a long time to swallow my ego and not worry about losing Quake duels but when I did it became obvious that caring too much about the result and your pride affects your ability to win, but not thinking about the pressure and not fretting about your losses allows you to think more clearly during and after each game.

Another important lesson people should learn is that your SUPPOSED to lose when you first start playing Quake. Its an insanely complex game that takes years to learn. People have gotten very good at it. If you expect to win in 10 games then you dont respect the game, because it wouldnt be a good competitive title if it was that easy.

Losing when you play a difficult game is natural, especially if youre new. Dont get bummed out by losing, get excited by what youre learning. I've played thousands of quake duels and I lose **a lot**. But I still really enjoy it, win or lose because I feel myself improving after all this time and I still have so much to learn.

They should definitely help you get frags and influence your playstyle, but they shouldnt dictate the pace of the game (like how overwatch abilities control when teams attack and when they hold back. The entire game is based around waiting for ults and waiting for opponents to use theirs up).

No characters like Mercy who need team mates to survive and who get no kills in a game and who would lose a fight against any DPS hero 1on1. Everyone should be a fragger who can stand on their own 2 feet, but the abilities should change the style in which they get frags. 

Make armour, health, weapons, aim, movement and positioning the deciding factors between who kills and who dies, not the class you happen to be playing vesus the class of the guy you just ran into.

Right now they seem to have the right philosophy in that department. The abilties dont give free kills, everyone can hold all the guns and resources are still found on the map. I hope they keep it this way

I've done thousands of duels in my life and it can be so hard to tell what seperates me from a better player. Someone I might be able to do way more damage to even but who would beat me 100% of the time.

When rapha streams quake this can be even more apparent as he will voice aloud to the viewers why he is doing something or what he thinks his opponent is doing and its always something that I would never have guessed until he said it or something I would never have thought of myself.

Him just walking into a room and grabbing a yellow armour seems like he just wants an extra 50 armour, but then he will say ""I came into this room because he is doing X, Y and Z and that means I can do A, B and C"" and then he does.

Some general advice:

* Rockets are for close range fights and arena denial (eg spamming a doorway so your opponent doesnt come through)

* Lg is for mid range, good for catching people in the air

* Rail is for long range, risky up close

* those are the main 3 guns, others are useful, but in more niche scenarios

* focus on an objective based style. Dont just chase for kills, try to remember when items will come up, think where your opponent is, what you need to succeed (eg. more armour, more health, a certain gun) and how you can get it. Winning games with much lower damage than your opponent is very possible

* armours come up 25s after they have been grabbed, mega health comes up 35s after its grabbed. Listen for the pickup, look at the clock and make a note of when its next up so you can plan an attack on it

Good luck and enjoy. Dont be discouraged if you lose, the game is hard as shit and people have gotten very good at it.",2016-10-21 12:45:30+00:00,d91o0kk,1.0,t3_58mxjh,1064.0,ArenaFPS

We never needed new maps to keep quake interesting. I've played 1v1 against the same guy at least 1000 times on the same few maps and it remains interesting because our styles clash and because we both evolve as players.

That feeling is multiplied by a billion when you play different people every day. Playing a B03 against someone you've never played before is a rollercoaster of trying to figure them out as a player and how to beat them and all this happens on those same old maps you've played before

The game and the players keep things fresh and interesting. New maps and heroes is wonderful of course, but if its the decider between being bored of a game or not, the game itself might be flawed.",2016-10-17 14:49:07+00:00,d8vr95c,2.0,t1_d8vq6l5,1472.0,pcgaming
102,"I'm on the fence. Its definitely very good that they have kept the skill based movement, the fact that weapons are map pickups, there is no carry limit, all that stuff is great.

The scary stuff is the different champions with different stats and abilities as you said. I'm definitely open to try this stuff as the classes seem very subtle, not like overwatch where there are defined healers who would lose any 1v1 fight with any non healer, the classes in QC will have access to all the guns and will all be able to fight on their own, but the activated and passive ability they each have will tweak their playstyle slightly and lean them towards a style of play existing in quake.

So instead of tanks, healers and dps, it seems to be that each class is a fragger, just with stats and skills that emphasise fragging in different ways. This to me seems like a good way to handle it.

They also seem to be handling the abilities in a good way. So where overwatch has 4 abilities, some with devestating effects like many of the ultimates that can wipe out teams, or stuns where your opponent cant do anything for a period of time where you can get free damage, Quake Champions is having a single passive (things like tweaks to that champs movement) and an active ability. The active abilities all seem to be small scale things, so unlike an Overwatch ulti that can do insane damage at the press of a button, and where they control the pace of the game where teams are waiting until they have ults or until the opponents have used ults before they make their move, the QC abilties are small things like teleports, or wraith forms. Things that wont just hand you a free kill, but will have to be used alongside good movement, aim and decision making.

So they are adding some new stuff, but they are adding it tastefully. I just hope it does add to the depth of the game, because we are sacrificing the pure classic balanced method that arena fps games are known for having to try this method, and if it doesnt make the game better, we will have given up something good for it.

Lastly, I hope they give adequate support to the 1v1 scene. I know they want to create a competitive team mode as new players will find it more welcoming, but I hope they dont neglect 1v1 as a result and I hope the game mode gets lan spots and matchmaking.

Sorry for the massive comment. TLDR: it looks pretty dope. Some things could be shit but they could also be great. I'm quite excited, and scared, but mostly excited",2016-10-17 13:38:27+00:00,d8vocze,4.0,t1_d8vni9n,1391.0,pcgaming

110,"Theres lots of good old maps that have kind of been forgotten. I cant say if the new maps are better than the old ones because I'm a shit tier player, but I definitely enjoyed some of the older maps like THCT1, XY2 and even WT1.

Maps are kind of what gives me a reason to play Reflex these days. Its not got my favourite arena fps gameplay, but it does have a ton of new and evolving maps to learn that havent been ported from other games. In my time playing Reflex I've had to learn so many new duel maps from tons of different mappers and its kept things fresh

My only complaint is that I wish there was more variance in size, scale and gameplay pace. As smilecythe said, a lot of the maps are very similar in a lot of respects. In QL when theres a tournament map pool theres a huge variance between the massive slow maps (sinister, cure, battleforged), the small fast cramped maps (hektik, toxicity, aerowalk) and everything in between (t7, ztn) as well as maps with kind of gimmicky but often interesting gameplay quirks (vertical vengeance, t9, even elder). I'd love to see more of that in Reflex

Sure the maps may have massive differences that are very apparent to top level players, but to someone at my level it feels like youre going from one small fast map to the next, whereas in QL the differences are so much larger that even to someone like me the variance is much easier to see and how it will impact the game is much more obvious.

* That you can carry all the weapons

* Some kind of item timer will be present (pie timers most likely) but not how they will work (who has access to see them, last player who picked or everyone)

152,"Time to stop buying the latest AAA games and try finding something more niche. AAA companies generally have to try to appeal to as wide of an audience as possible to be financially viable, meaning AAA games can often feel dumbed down or generic.

Indie game companies and more niche products are often more specialised, more willing to be hardcore and unforgiving, and seem to often be passion projects for the devs as opposed to business ventures (depending on the size of the developer)

Something as hardcore, complex and mentally/mechanically demanding as Reflex would never be made by a AAA company because its too damn hard, too niche in its appeal and too difficult to get into.

172,"&gt; where you're alone against the enemy, and have nobody to ""fall back"" on if you do poorly

Some people see this as a positive of 1v1. You are the sole reason for your success of failure, nobody to babysit you, nobody to hold you back. Its one of the reasons I value 1v1 so much

&gt; Another thing is the way that everyone's playstyle differs, making sure that no match will be played similarly to another, in 1v1, you tend to get bored due to the similarity of how matches are played(unless you always use a different playstyle, though most players tend to ""main"" certain strategies).

I disagree with this a great deal. If the game is good, then peoples playstyles can be wildly different and crypically complex to figure out. I've duelled the same guy in Quake for maybe 1000 games at this point and I still enjoy watching his playstyle change and adapting to it.

And thats just a single player, I also get to duel tons of other people, all who also have their own style that I have to figure out and counter all within a single 10 minute game. Different maps can also transform how a player behaves and show their style in a new light to keep it even more fresh

Every single game I play is 1v1. Starcraft is cool, but I dont see myself playing it if it was centered around a team mode. Same goes for Quake. I adore it but I adore the 1v1. I dont want someone else (who isnt my opponent) to have an effect on whether I win or lose. I also love the mindgames you get from 1v1, the deciet, the predictions, the bluffs. Thats all a lot harder to find and notice in the clustery and messy team games where theres too much going on. 

I cant comment on your main question, as I only play SC2 every now and then. I dont play any other strategy games. But I will say that the fact that they target 1v1 as their main competitive mode is a huge draw to me. It might not be the way to financial success for a game, but it does make me happy as a consumer. ",2016-09-16 09:01:38+00:00,d7p0bkm,1.0,t3_52zghp,29124.0,truegaming

If you like that style of gameplay, then keep an eye out for:

* **Diabotical** - An Arena FPS in development by the gdstudio, led by James 2GD Harding. It was just funded on Kickstarter and they are working towards a beta

* **Quake Champions** - The next multiplayer quake title, also in development with a beta planned for late this year or early next year I think. More team game focused in the competitive side of things (unlike diabotical which is talking about a competitive 1v1 and team mode) and slightly less ""classic"" than Diabotical with its classes and activated abilities, but still will likely have a very old school feel (strafe jumping, rocket jumps, lots of guns)

Other good old school MP games to get into:

* **Quakeworld**

* **Half life death match**

183,"&gt; Would you agree that someone with perfect aim and superhuman reaction time would be able to beat anyone at the game?

Irrelevant. If you use that to value the amount of tactical depth in a game then you also have to throw out the tactical depth in any sport with player to player interaction. Squash, basketball, rugby, football, american football, tennis would all be dominated by someone with superhuman ability and that would render the tactical aspect null.

Same goes for starcraft where micro bots can do things so advanced that humans cant keep up. Someone with that ability in starcraft would dominate the game, even though its a strategy game with a high emphasis on decision making

That doesnt mean the tactical aspect isnt there though. Nobody can or will ever have that ability. Execution is incredibly important in quake, but it isnt more important than the tactical decision making. They go hand in hand.

I'll be honest, it sounds like you just dont understand the game. When you say things like ""because it's being smothered by how important execution is in the game"" its so unbearably wrong. Its so rare that someone can win a fight, let alone a duel, if they have entered it with an incorrect decision and good aim. So rare that if it happens it boggles the minds of the casters. I can think of one example, but you seem to think that its something that is dominating the game. In quake, you dont take a fight until you have the overwhelming advantage to win it. Nobody is running in wildly because they have sick aim, and if they did, they would be punished heavily for giving up info on their location, running through a choke point and for taking a fight at an disadvantageous time

If you dont have good decision making, you may as well be aiming and moving with your eyes closed. The greatest aimers in the world wouldnt get close to the top with my level of decision making and I've been playing quake for over a decade. In a game like Quake Live, Skill and Decision making are equal parts important. I'd wager even that the decision making is more important.

Its also worth noting that how well you can execute is based on your decision making. Being the worlds best aimer means nothing if youre constantly kept out of position by a player with better tactics. He will hit more than you simply because he has secured either better weapons for the situation, denied you the appropriate weapon, or he has secured a better position to safely deal damage, or all three.

Skill and aim are the wheels on the car, but decision making and strategy is the driver. You need to keep up your skill somewhat to be able to contend, but your decision making is what will decide who wins, how good of a player you are and how far you can get in the scene. You cant coast on good aim, movement and reactions, you just need modest amounts of each to be able to execute the all important decisions and stategies.",2016-09-15 09:09:07+00:00,d7nlepy,,t1_d7mttjq,48519.0,truegaming

If you play more indie titles or competitive multiplayer games or even just some stuff that isn, hitting 100fps and up is relatively easy on most rigs

My PC is old but because I'm into competitive FPS and RTS, I run everything at 120fps minimum, some at 250-300fps. For single player games, if they are modern and graphically intensive I often push the graphics down to make sure I'm getting a high frame rate

194,"&gt; I think Arena Shooters have incredibly high execution requirements, but don't really offer much more strategic depth than something like Halo or Call of Duty (when played competitively).

This is a misconception that quake has suffered from for years, apart from by people that actually play it.

The worlds greatest quake player is a thinker. He has lesser aim than nearly every opponent he beats. The whole game is very well balanced between decision making and execution. 

There are many arena shooters that favour skill and execution over decision making, thats true. Reflex and CPMA definitely fall into that catagory. 

But Quake Live is not one of them. I have absolutely dreadful aim and beat people much more skillful than me very regularly.

The whole game is about controlling the map, tricking your opponent, subverting their expectations, trapping them and out thinking them. The entire game is 10 minutes of insane mental stress trying to keep track of your opponents, stack, weapons, position on the map, the times on 3 or 4 of the items, coming up with a way to either stay defensive or to somehow set up your next kill and tons of other things. 

Your skill is just the icing on the cake that allows you to make these decisions slightly differently depending on how it compares to your opponent.

Quake has insane amounts of strategic depth, its just that its obfuscated and hard to percieve. Its not obvious like the build someone uses in a starcraft game and many of the insane tactical plays a quake player might make are lost on 3/4 of the audience watching the game.

Having a long list of offline challenges to play and enjoy that let you get to grips with movement and weapons is perfect for this. Same for things like horde modes, bot challenges, time trials. 

A simple tutorial like the Quake Live one or the Warsow one wont cut it because it either lasts 5 minutes or is too hard to complete at all.

Games like CSGO and Dota 2 have a lot of downtime. CSGO has it between every round or when you are dead, Dota has a lot of laid back period in between fights and inbetween the intense laning. Things like walking to shop, grabbing something from your courier and most of all when you die you get like 60 seconds of chill time

Comparing these games to Quake or Unreal Tournament or any arena fps, a single duel means 10+ minutes of insane concentration. You cant take a break, you cant take a moment to sit back and crack your knuckles, a single mistake means you could lose the game. Rapha and Evil had a 28 minute match at the last quakecon grand finals and the mental fortitude to be able to do that and not make mistakes or get impatient is insane because theres just no respite.

Starcraft is the same, from the moment your workers start mining its go time and theres no rest until one of you has won.

222,"For pure mechanical skill you could argue Warsow, Quakeworld and CPMA.

Warsow has the added dash element to a movement system that is otherwise very similar to cpma which just means you have more inputs and timings to get right. It also makes the players move much faster than Reflex (though the pace of reflex duels is faster due to the small maps). Also when players reach certain speeds, aiming can be insanely hard for them and their opponent

In CPMA I find stair jumps and double jumps in general to be more difficult to pull off. Movement feels easier to execute in Reflex in general, though not by much. Reflex plasma jumps and climbs are also insanely easy compared to CPMA and hitting direct grenades is trivial in Reflex but very hard in CPMA

Quakeworld seems to have a much faster game pace than any other arena fps, even if its not the fastest by pure measurement of UPS. This adds a big emphasis on aim, prediction and ability to use projectiles effectively. Movement is very important and watching players like Locktar use rocket jumps to quickly gain positioning, everything seems to take place much faster than in Reflex

Not that these are good or bad things. I dont think the best game is simply the most skillful one or the fastest one. I value decision making, map control and a players ability to subvert his opponents expectations, trap and suprise him.

My estimations of the skill levels of each game is definitely up for discussion and I'm sure I'm not right about everything there, but I do disagree that Reflex is the most skillful (though its definitely in the group of arena fps that is heavily weighted towards rewarding skill more so than other aspects)",2016-09-06 10:24:14+00:00,d7bbr9t,4.0,t1_d7bb1by,2731.0,ArenaFPS

**Plasma**: Similar to Reflex where the knockback is very strong so that area denial is more effective and plasma jumps become more powerful and useful. In QL the gun is used so rarely but something like this would make it much more viable though still keeping it as a tier 2 weapon

**Grenade launcher**: Similar to Warsow where the grenades are fast moving and cover large distances if bounced correctly. In QL you need to have been spamming an area well in advance to effectively deny it making the gun only useful in some niche scenarios (like spamming mega on ztn from the red) and even then you can often easily move around them, but in Warsow the gun is a lot more scary and a lot better at denying areas quickly. Makes it fill its role more effectively but again, still keeps it as a tier 2 weapon. They either need a quick explosion or a large hitbox while on the ground (but not in the air as they may become like the old Reflex GL where you could get 300 damage with it by spamming it in close up fights and getting direct hits easily).

If the current shotgun is the starting gun then my vote would be for a longer ranger range and tighter spread than QLs shotgun, but with a lower max damage. Something like the QW boomstick",2016-09-06 08:24:53+00:00,d7b9vl4,1.0,t3_51bs60,38346.0,Diabotical

Most people that watch starcraft tournaments dont play SC 1v1 or maybe even the game at all. Most people that watch quake duel tournaments play CA, FFA, TDM or CTF.

Its become the identity for Quake esports, its what people know it for and in the FPS esports scene it is unique and dominated by them.

Some people say that 1v1 was never popular but its worth considering the following:

* Even though its not the most played mode, most people who play quake from all different modes still watch the 1v1 tournaments, the same way that most of the people watching starcraft tournaments dont play 1v1

* starcraft and fighting games have found a way to make 1v1 work for the masses. Starcraft does this with nice matchmaking, ranks, tutorials and practice modes. Quake has never had any of this. nor has any other 1v1 fps. 

The question of whether 1v1 can be popular for quake champions is impossible to answer, the data we have right now isnt relevant because the infrastructure around the afps games and the modes is no way near the same as something like starcraft, but with quake champions, it could be. 

Pursuing 1v1 as the main mode is a risk, but not terribly so as people who play quake play a multitude of modes anyway and it wouldnt matter if 1v1 was the most played mode. What is also a risk though is trying to compete with overwatch and csgo in the team game esports space.

246,"When playing someone who is a low skill player, a newbie will still lose, but the score wont be 60-0 and they wont spend the entire duel totally under pressure. I run into a lot of players in Reflex that cant even strafe jump.

I'm not saying that they should endure total stomps where they can barely get a weapon off spawn, because I think their estimation of how many players are at that skill is wrong. Also telling the guy youre playing youre new makes them lay off and many in reflex want to teach.

They will still lose to new players, but they will learn the movement, weapons, the maps and get to grips with playing defensive. Its definitely even better if they can bring friends or find people as new as them. Discord is good for that, and making sure to add people you have close games with.

Next patch is matchmaking I think (or maybe the one after that). Hopefully that helps with this somewhat.

Well you should be enjoying watching your skills grow. Theres a lot to learn in a game like Reflex and it can be fun to climb the mountain. Youre not supposed to enjoy losing, just find a way to not mind it. 

You might lose 10 games in a row, but when you get that win it feels a thousand times better than beating a dark souls boss. And even if youve spent a few days being smacked around by better players, when you come across someone newer than you, chances are you will stomp them into the ground

In stuff like ctf, something like a sensor you can shoot onto walls would actually be really good as long as its pretty limited. Would be a good way to detect how people are entering the base and make the callout to your team.

A grenade that delpoys a gas when it explodes that slows people in its radius would also be cool to stop flag runners. Could even be quite cool in duel if you need to slow down the in control player so you can steal an item or make an escape.

In games like Quake Live, hitting a lucky grenade in combat is A. incredibly unlikely and B. incredibly risky as they will be fighting you with weapons that are actually effective in combat. 

Its role in duel at least is 100% area denial. If you are denying a mega with it and they jump in anyway and take 100 dmg, that isnt a lucky grenade, thats a stupid opponent.

In Reflex though I agree, you hit a lot of direct grenades in close quarters combat and if youre out of control and can only get a GL, thats often 200 dmgs worth anyway. That is being fixed in the next patch

I do agree that a change to the way quake weapons work would be fun though. But I dont know how you would go about changing the grenade launcher to make it more tactical",2016-08-23 13:04:35+00:00,d6t5y1y,2.0,t1_d6t4977,3292.0,ArenaFPS

254,"I hope they dont add too many. And if they add the classic secondary quake weapons, I hope they make them a bit more useful in their current roles as right now in QL they are almost too niche and are used so infrequently.

I'm not sure how they can make the shotgun more used. Right now in duel its a good finishing weapon and a good weapon to trap people with at tele exits, but thats pretty much it. If they plan to have it as their starting weapon (which I'm not sure is true but I think I remember something like that being mentioned) then I think it would need to be accurate over longer distances than the QL SG and do less damage on a full hit. If its not the starting weapon then I cant think how to make it more useful than in QL

For plasma I hope they do it kind of like Reflex does. Large plasma cells and powerful knockback, both good for arena denial and for plasma climbs and jumps which are realy strong in that game and give the weapon more use than the niche scenarios in QL.

For the grenade launcher I hope they do something like warsow from a physics perspective. The grenade is like a disk that moves really fast and can be fired really far, its easy to bounce it around corners and have it skim across the floor to cover more ground and the hitbox seems large enough that it effectively denies the area, but not so large that you are constantly hitting direct grenades in combat and using it as a rocket launcher

Warsow is actually a pretty good example of a game where every weapon is extremely useful, and because of the limited ammo system you have to use them all a lot more and cant just live off of rail, rocket and LG like you can in QL duel. It makes the duels more fun and varied and presents more combat situations because using these guns in combat means positioning yourself differently to the main 3.",2016-08-23 08:14:21+00:00,d6szs1m,1.0,t3_4z44hj,22613.0,ArenaFPS

282,"For this to work I think the spawning player would have to be invisible too during the 5s limbo time. Otherwise if the incontrol players sees them he will just follow him until he spawns and get a spawnfrag, but even easier since he wont have to guess where he will appear

Another method for fixing random spawns would be to do something like UT4 has. But take it a little further. So:

* At the start of the game, both players spawn on the map and have 10s to position themselves, but cannot shoot or pickup items during this time. Like CA

OR

* Players cointoss for first spawn choice, or player who picked the map in a tournament, the other gets the first spawn choice

I personally prefer the first method as the second would ruin B01 and random matchmaking games.

THEN

* During the duel after it has started, when a player dies he should be given the choice of 2 spawns, the method for how these are chosen I dont know (furthest and closest to opposing player for example). The choices should be presented as an image of the spawn point, but not a live image, just a generic one.

That way the spawns arent random and the opposing player has to predict where they will CHOOSE to spawn as opposed to guessing what spawn their opponent will be landed with by chance.

It also means the game doesnt have to slow down as much as in your suggestion. 5s of delay after each frag slows the game down so much and gives a lot of free time to recoup after messy frags to the in control player which could cause it to snowball

------------------------------------

Theres lots of cool things they could try with spawns, and I dont know what the best choice is, but I hope something is attempted. Any randomness that can be removed is good in my eyes.

Means you need to control both mega and red instead of just living off armours.

If 2 players have 100/200, then the mega becomes a hugely important item and creates an interesting paradigm where both players need it to reach 200/200 because simply getting another red wont do anything.

Rather than being able to take certain fights because you have won certain resources and positioning, you are instead forced to take certain fights and certain positions based on the class you chose.

Once you have picked your class you have to play your classes style whereas with traditional afps, you play the style you want to play, provided you have the ability to make that work

Also it makes games needlessly hard to balance. In 1v1 there will probably be one class that is the best no matter how many patches they do. In some games like overwatch you can lose a fight literally because you were the wrong class for it

This stuff seems less pronounced in Quake Champions because the classes all have access to every weapon and still have to pick up resources, but its still going to be there somewhat and I think people are wondering, why make the change and what will it bring to the game?

I'm not sure if youre asking for the gun to be in as a weapon to use in fun casual modes, or suggesting it should be part of the core roster in competitive modes, but perhaps you should explain why the gun would be a good addition to the game? If it was implemented like it is in UT4 then it would completely turn the game on its head from a balance and map design perspective. If it was nerfed and brought down so that it isnt such a central point in the game then why have it at all, when it clogs up a weapon roster that already has tools for long, mid, close fights, movement and area denial?

If Quake champions was remaining a duel based game and they were balancing the champions around that it would be much closer in the race to my heart, but even if they were I would be faced with one game that can provide classic gameplay, competitive 1v1 AND crazy modes (diabotical) and one game that is trying something new but something that strays away from what I like about arena fps a little (quake champions)

So yes, they will be competitors, but they seem to be focusing on slightly different niches within arcade shooters. If all idsoft hosted tournaments are for team games and all official Diabotical tournaments are for 1v1 then that might do a little to seperate them in the public image. Already I hear a lot of people shouting that QC is straying away from classic afps fashion and pointing at Diabotical as an example of a game thats doing it right

Ultimately though I wish these games could live in cohesion, like fighting games do. Give me an arena fps lan in 2018 with Diabotical, QC, UT4 and Reflex tournaments as well as all the smaller titles",2016-08-05 14:59:19+00:00,d65f37w,1.0,t3_4waj9g,3389.0,Diabotical

Sometimes games just go viral and it doesn't matter if your in early access for years because your new and unique gameplay is keeping people hooked.

My point is that while UT isn't a groundbreaking title with new unique gameplay, it is a solid game, same for reflex. 

If you're going to release a solid game that appeals to a niche and try to attract more gamers outside of that niche to it, you aren't going to get this mass viral appeal without doing something completely new and innovative.

So without this mass appeal but while still being good games, UT and Reflex are exposed to the negative effects that come with early access and open development and effected by it much more noticeably than these new innovative titles that created waves the moment they hit the scene

Reflex and UT are good games. For quake and UT players they are very good games. But right from the start they appeal to a subset of the gaming world.

This is preferable to them just picking their competitive mode and trying to push that. It might not be smart from a business perspective, but as a consumer I'd love to see them just work on having a well balanced duel, tdm, ctf and ffa modes, and then letting the community run with it

I dont look forward to the shit-talk threads from people who want to see the gametypes quake is known for at these events they've been mentioning, when all ID wants to do is push this new mode onto them",2016-06-30 19:17:40+00:00,d4ucysk,2.0,t1_d4uborx,1605.0,ArenaFPS
341,"Thats why I'm torn about it. It almost seems like a choice between initial playerbase or longevity, because getting lots of people into a duel game is hard and getting long lasting success in such a saturated scene as team game fps is also hard

Its also not like Quake only has one gametype. It would be possible for them to still focus on duel as the main competitive mode, and have modes like FFA and CA to bring in new players. 

Of course as a duel player I'm biased, but I think just changing your gameplay model to mimic everyone else and joining the rat race is far less respectable and probably less viable in the long term to simply doing what quake does best and dominating the 1v1 fps scene

Something like QC stands a chance at bringing back 1v1 fps to popularity again and if they pulled it off it would stand as the pillar of the genre. Like starcraft that dominates multiplayer rts, QC would dominate a newly revived 1v1 fps scene. Its a risk, as there isnt much of a 1v1 fps scene right now, but reviving the scene is about as hard as making a name for yourself among games like Overwatch and CSGO and all the other masses of team game shooters",2016-06-30 18:23:10+00:00,d4uacqp,3.0,t1_d4u9ich,1068.0,ArenaFPS
342,"Im kind of torn about the whole thing. On the one hand, team games are infinitely more approachable to new players and it will probably be easier for them to get an larger initial group of people who will be willing to play if they have team games

But on the other hand, Quake has survived a long time on 1v1 because it has so much competitive depth, its easy to organise in tournaments, and in the FPS space, its unique and dominated by Quake

I think its short sighted to go for team modes when pretty much every other FPS is fighting for the same thing. Theres no way QC will be able to contend with games like Overwatch and CSGO in that space.

So while 1v1 is more initimidating and harder to get non-fps players excited about, I think they stand a better chance at putting out a quality, long lasting product and carving a niche in the esports scene by trying to make duel their main mode than just battling to be one of the many FPS focusing on team games",2016-06-30 15:33:31+00:00,d4u2c5v,1.0,t3_4qm25z,2611.0,ArenaFPS

360,"Something I see all the time is people that dont play arena fps anymore, or casual players who occasionally dip into AFPS, saying that UT is the best. Whereas in the actual AFPS community, UT is quite niche and in the corner compared to quake. The majority of people who play Arena FPS games and have done for years are playing or are fans of Quake over UT

So I think thats a disparity between the competitive and casual communities. UTs competitive scene paled in comparison to Quakes and it died out extremely quickly whereas Quakes is still going on today with 2-3 tournaments a week. 

Both scenes have dwindled of course, but as an example, Quakecon this year will feature many of the top Quake players of the last decade like rapha and zero4 because they are still playing, but UT died out pretty soon after UT2k4 from a competitive standpoint.

Just an interesting thing to note about the 2 games. Its rare to see a post about UT on /r/arenafps, whereas quake and quake-like games are constantly mentioned because thats what the majority of actual arena fps players play.

As Gilanguar said, nobody is doing 1v1 FPS so they have to decide whats more difficult, making 1v1 FPS popular again and undoubtedly being the kings of that genre, or trying to get a spot in the saturated team game scene

Duel:

A good example is Reflex. No way a AAA dev would make the game Reflex is aiming to be. It uses a complex movement system and has a gameplay style that is hugely unforgiving. Its terrifying for new players and offers a massive uphill climb

Financially its not viable to make something like this unless you have all the money in the world to market it, fill it with fluff and keep new players who will lose 0-30 every game interested

But the Reflex devs went for it because they are passionate about that style of gameplay. It has a small population (partly because its not finished and not marketed during development) but as a fan of arena fps, its a great game and I'm glad they havent pulled any punches.

Just being able to time 2 of the items in a 1v1 duel while being put under pressure by an opponent is an impressive thing to do and is a pretty basic skill of moderate to high skilled players and only 1 of a list of things you have to do. I can play 30 games of overwatch in a row, but I have to tap out after a couple of duels in quake because its too mentally stressful and draining

Anyone who understands quake at a high level would say Overwatch doesnt even come close. One of the best quake players in the world (rapha) is hailed as being someone who has an average aim for a top player. Aim that isnt comparable to the hard hitters like strenx, tox and k1llsen, but he beats these players constantly because his decision making, strategy and mental presence is spot on.

Another top player is cooller who also has reasonable aim, but his ability to lock down a map and deny resources from his opponent are what makes him so strong

Quake allows for aim players, brain players and everything in between",2016-06-10 09:45:48+00:00,d43g5yk,3.0,t1_d434cwe,28615.0,truegaming

Overwatch is a mostly slow, class based game with 1 gun per hero and 4 activated abilities.

Quake is a fast paced game with the ability to carry around 8 different guns, with zero activated abilities.

The fact of the matter is that OW combat is near identical to Dota/moba combat, apart from the camera angle. It shares very few similarities to quake and its differences are enormous enough to make them very different games

488,"Its not as trivial as ""less than 5 abilities"". The combat system is near identical to a game like Dota 2, except its in first person.

Your mouse1 is your auto attack (which you have to aim in OW unlike dota). Your 3 abilties are your Q, W and E and your ultimate is your R. 

The types of abilities are very reminiscent of mobas. Skills that wont miss if done at the right time. Auto aiming abilities like mcree and 76s ultimate.

These types of abilities make the game more about teamwork, timing and decision making than about pure skill and aim.

All it would take would be for OW to be played in an isometric style and it would play very much like a moba from a combat perspective. The gametypes are of course very different and thats why I wouldnt call it a moba, but the combat is definitely moba influenced.

Thats no bad thing of course. Theres a certain lack of randomness and a lot of strategic clarity you get from thecertainty of moba combat. The abiltity to know what moves a player has, to know that when you press X button, X will happen exactly as you want it. The variation comes from the timing, positioning and decisions of all 12 players.

Its like chess. In chess, if you want to move a piece, you can and it will land on the desired place. Its the implications of that move that matter. In a game like quake, you can plan to do a certain thing, but your execution may still fail you, so your plans can never be as concrete if you dont have the skill to execute them.

493,"This argument doesnt make sense to me. People say it about timing in Quake too. When timers were introduced in Reflex, some people said ""it doesnt matter because adding 35 seconds to the clock isnt hard"" but its not about it being difficult, its about it being another tiny little nuance that the player has to manage while thinking about all the other things going on

All of these nuances add up to the point where the best players are the ones that can manage the most of them at once. So by having flank notifications automated, it removes the need for this to be something managed by the players in a lot of cases

A small factor indeed, but all the small factors add up. Making this something that the team has to manage via communication and awareness rather than being alerted by the game is just another factor that could decide which team is better than the other. The more of these the better

I also disagree that ""good players will have heard the footsteps way before the flank notification triggers"". This is a pretty blanket statement and there are lots of potential scenarios where talking on comms, being flustered or the general excitement of the game could stop that from happening. Sure they might hear it 90% of the time, but its that 10% where they might slip and a team mate should be able to pick up the slack and alert him rather than simply being told they are in danger by the game

I'm making a bigger deal out of this than it is, mostly because I've seen this argument applied to things in games that have a much larger impact. People wanting things automated because the task on its own is not a particularily challenging test of skill/communication/decision making. Forgetting that its the combination of all these task and your ability to manage as many of them as possible that makes a good player

* It would do a default splash radius and damage for standing (so you dont have to be falling to use it)

* Kind of like your speed idea the damage and splash would increase depending on your falling velocity (faster you fall the more it does)

* It can be used by fresh spawns to keep the opposing player who is rushing them at a distance

* It can be used to ambush a player who is below you for massive damage if you want to take the risk of losing the high ground positioning

I dont know if it would work, but it seems like an interesting and satisfying mechanic if implemented properly (no long and tiresome animations)

* how easy it is to hit the melee in Diabotical

* how fast you can go

Because if you compare it to a game like quake (which could well be a totally unrelated reference point for all we know), the melee is so hard to hit and the movement is slow enough that there is almost never a chance to do something like this without being completely gunned down

But in Diabotical something like this might be way more legitimate. Who knows.

I always liked the idea of a stomp attack. So instead of a melee weapon, you can do a ground stomp by pressing your melee button and you would do it without changing weapon. 

A stomp while standing on the ground would do a bit of damage in a splash radius around you and knock players back a little. A big stomp when falling would do more and more damage with more and more splash the higher you jumped from.

Something like this that doesnt make me change weapon but can be useful in a wide range of scenarios would be really cool and really powerful if someone dared to go for a high ground stomp.

Another step and you have games like hearthstone and ~~heroes of the storm where talking to your opponents is prohibited and your KD is obscured~~. In heroes of the storm everyone gets gold at the same time, levels at the same time. Its impossible to look like a bad player in that game

And now this in Overwatch. 

It feels like we are on a downward spiral in an attempt to shield peoples feelings and make bad players feel like good players. I dont mind this so much for unranked modes, but I dont want to miss out on all the interesting stats and player interaction and an accurate representation of my ability on a competitive game mode.

Part of what make Quake such a fun game for me is the fact that if youre bad, it tells you that you are bad, you can see what you are bad at and exactly how bad and you can be inspired to improve. If modern ""competitive"" games are just going to try and make everyone always feel good about how they are playing then far fewer people are going to get that itch to want to better themselves.

I played Overwatch for the first time last night. I'm sure I am not very good at it. I did a lot of misclicks, silly mistakes, got dunked a lot, but constantly the game was saying ""good job, youre doing great, keep it up"". 

I have no idea how I actually performed and the short stat screen at the end didnt help. I want to compare how I am playing to other players and I want the truth about my performance. I dont want to be shielded from the cold hard sting of being shit at a game.

522,"&gt; You're letting nostalgia cloud your judgement if you think a standard arena shooter will ever be popular again. What are the two big arena shooters now? UT, quake live, reflex? I don't have their in game numbers; but there's a total of 23 people watching those games on Twitch right now.

Their hasnt been a proper, competitive, AAA arena shooter released since 2007. The most recent (quake 4 and UT3) were poorly received and AFPS players went back to previous incarnations within a few years because the games didnt improve at all on their previous incarnations and had massive launch issues

How could the genre possibly still be thriving if the most recent AAA and well received arena shooters were released in 1999?

The games are still amazing and the remaining players are still passionate. QL as an example gets 3-4 tournaments a week. Theres a $25k QL tourney coming up at quakecon. A few thousand people playing every night.

Arena FPS games are insanely good, but they are scary, intimidating, require an enormous amount of effort to be good at and worst of all they have no flashy AAA modern arena shooters with cinematic trailers and unlockable crates to draw people in with.

The chicken and egg problem is that because there arent any big games to draw in new players with carrots and sticks, there will never be any interest from other big studios to create similar games. The indie titles are fighting a huge uphill battle to attract people to a game that they WILL be bad at until they practice without a marketing budget or name recognition or the capacity to create a sea of crates and items.

UT on the other hand is not momentum based and its movement is more based on button presses. Eg, if you can hit A twice you will dodge to the left but in Reflex if you press the correct buttons for a circle jump but your technique is off, you wont circle jump or you wont do it well

The most notable difference however is the speed. Reflex to UT is like comparing a cat to a slightly overweight corgi. Not that UT being slow is a bad thing of course, speed doesnt = quality.

* Unreal Tournament - You already play this. The slowest and most fighting game like of the AFPS games. Lots of button combinations and zoning. Not momentum based.

* Reflex - Very fast paced, momentum based, mechanically complex

* Warsow - The fastest Arena FPS game on the market, uses maps that are pretty much unique to it, despite its speed it has a heavy focus on resource management

* Xonotic - A better, more updated, open source version of the game in the op. Excels at combat in particular where the weapon switch allows you to use many guns in the same fight. Roughly as fast as Reflex and slower than Warsow

* Quake Live - The best choice if you want a mid paced duel game. Faster than UT, slower than Reflex. A very nice balance between brain and mechanics. Probably my favourite

* Toxikk - A UT clone with some unique weapons and movement similar to UT2004

Practice and experience will get you much further than simply having good aim. The people I beat in Quake duels all have better mechanics and aim than me.

658,"&gt; I think variable frag limits could be confusing, you lose consistency in the game rules. 

Thats true. Could be somewhat offset by good huds/ui/announcers that keep new players informed. And casters that discuss the map and its frag limit before the game. But I agree a consistant win condition makes sense

You definitely couldnt have the same frag limit for each map, at least not with the maps we are used to.

There are some discrepencies in maps that we currently have, like maps such as vertical vengeance that has no red armour and the mega spawns every 2 minutes which is nothing like any of the other maps, and it was a map that saw plenty of tournament play

&gt; I personally like the concept of on use abilities that spawn two times a game at 3.33 and 6.66 and that have a decently long lasting effect which isn't damage necessarily.

You need to make sure that things like this arent just things that will just go straight over to the guy in control and furthering his lead

And while they would add some hype to the game, if someone is 10 frags up at 6.66, it doesnt matter who gets the item because unless its insanely strong, chances are the games already over anyway.

Trying to add hype like this feels kind of artificial rather than constructing a gametype prone to hype. Sports like football achieve this nicely in that its extremely uncommon for a team to be up 5 goals at half time. Games usually are decided by 1 or 2 goals and therefore the losing team is usually only 1 goal away from catching up for like an hour at a time. Any goal from any team is a big deal in most games because it either extends a lead massively in one fell swoop, or closes the gap massively or ties the game up. Each goal has an enourmous effect that is concentrated into a single moment and pretty much every game has these moments of euphoria among the spectators

I dont really like football, but this is something it does well",2016-03-09 10:24:07+00:00,d0t82m5,3.0,t1_d0t7st4,1099.0,ArenaFPS
659,"I think elder was onto something with how the map changed as the game went on. Players deciding if and when to open doorways and secret passages permanently, the rail room opening 2 minutes in. It isnt the best map, but the ideas in it are really good and create some slight game changers as the game goes on.

I wonder how duel would work with a frag limit that is map dependant. Like for example, on Cure on QL, the winner could be the first to get 6 frags.

This way if someone is getting stomped the duel is over quickly. If the losing player has no frags, his opponent has 5, but he just got control of the map, even though he is 6 frags away from winning and his opponent only needs 1, given the fact that he has control and has no time limit, its feasable that he will make up the 6 frags (unlike a player who is 6 frags down at halfway in a normal duel which is very unlikely and often written off by the casters at that point on a map like cure or dm13).

I think this would create pretty good tension throughout the game, feasable comebacks and short games if its a complete stomp.

When I watch dota 2 vods I generally look for the longest length videos because I know they will be the best games. With a frag limit system you could sort of do the same thing. Shit games are over quickly and good games could last much longer and would constantly be intense.

The only major downside I can think of is players who get an insanely good spawn and first minute of the game could be set to win. But this is something that can be adressed in a games balance, the score limit per map and the maps design as well as in the players mindsets. 

I dont think dropping this system into an existing game would work that well. The game would have to be designed around it.

* Its slow 

* The animated finishers look like they will get old very quickly in SP and have no place being in MP

* The gun balance in the alpha was strange but thats no major issue just yet

* The movement has no interesting techniques to it and as such you can master it in 5 minutes (as opposed to quake movement that I havent mastered in 13 years)

* Snapmap is not powerful and we cannot use it to create custom gemoetry so that might rule out user made competitive maps

* Loadouts are dreadful in any sort of competitive arena fps (though perfectly fine for casual games)

But there are some small silver linings.

* There MIGHT be a cvar for strafejumping as revealed in a recent leak of the code

* There MIGHT be a more powerful mod tool, also revealed in the leak though we arent sure if it will be made public

* There looks to be an option to turn off the animated finishers in PVP

But the problem is that its clear they are shooting for the casual audience with this game and any hardcore players that want something competitive will be a niche, playing a custom rule set in the deep dark corners of the games community.

The main game looks like it will have all the things the quake players turned their noses up at, and the best case scenario is a niche game mode where we can turn all the nonsense off.

Another small silver lining are the Quake 5 rumours. QL devs have teased a new quake project in different twitch chats at quake tournaments and there are a lot of rumblings here and there about it recently.

A theory is that they are working on a competitive quake 5 game and Doom is being created so casually and noob friendly so as not to compete with the upcoming quake 5. This is a theory and is definitely not confirmed by id software

**Conclusion**

As a quake player I will buy Doom, simply because its a new doom. I will play the single player and I will play the multiplayer for as long as it holds my interest, but if it was to release with the gameplay decisions present in the alpha, I dont see it holding my interest for long.

If they make some drastic changes to make it faster, more skillful and more competitive I would play it for a long long time I'm sure, but I doubt they will for reasons illustrated above

My hopes for Doom were very high since all the way back last year when marty stratton said ""we will tease more about our fast paced competitive multiplayer in the future"" or something to that effect.

I disagree that its about jealousy. I bought the mace in the most recent cosmetic set. Not because I want people to be jealous of my mace, but because I like how it looks and would prefer it to the default weapon and I want to support the devs financially.

I think you are projecting your thought process when it comes to cosmetics on other people.

&gt; If I went to the movies as a poor kid and all my rich friends bought a bunch of snacks and drinks and didn't have the human decency to share it then you're damn right I'd be upset.

I didnt stipulate that you were a poor kid and that your friends were dicks. You added that to validate your point.

My point was that snacks are extra. Not mandatory to watch the film, but something you can pay extra for if you want it. Same with the cosmetics. I wouldnt be annoyed if my friend got a slushy and a hotdog when we go to see a movie, just like I wont be annoyed if I duel my friend and see he bought the mjolnir cosmetic. 

Not getting jealous and annoyed is the normal reaction to something like that. 

You saying that your resolve is being tested and that you dont have the willpower and that you will cave and buy an item is your issue. Not an issue with the game or with the decision to add cosmetics.

There isnt just one. I was using Reflex as an example. A welcoming attitude to new players is pretty much the norm in most arena fps games these days.

This may be true of something like Quake Live, but is definitely not true for lots of the newer arena fps communities.

In a game like reflex for example the players are extremely friendly and willing to teach new players. There are FFA nights being hosted by community members to teach new players to play, old veterans making movement maps so newbies can practice. I myself have taught tons of new players how to set up their game, timing items, giving adivce on different maps and explaining hwo the game works.

And as far as map knowledge goes, the maps in Reflex are brand new and constantly changing and new ones are constantly coming out. Veteran of the genre or not, these maps are brand new to everyone.

&gt; Basically, Arena shooters have been completely devoid of innovation for upwards of a decade

This is pretty true (unless you count some very small indie titles). 2 games in development that seem to be innovating are Insight (a stealth based arena fps) and Diabotical (an arena fps made by james 2gd harding which uses lots of brand new ideas).

In the different games of Arena FPS, people all seem to know each other and recognise nicknames and it creates a nice environment for sure, but that doesnt mean the community doesnt really wish the game could grow in popularity.

I love the small familiar community of Arena FPS, but I would love the community to be somewhere closer to 10,000 players for an arena fps game or two.

More players makes for an ever evolving competitive scene, new faces cropping up in tournaments and it makes things like matchmaking all the more viable.

Last sunday we had one of our top players who typically wins all the time get knocked out of the tournament pretty quickly and a different winner which felt pretty great.

I imagine that feeling would be massively magnified if we could see new players joining the scene and rising to contend with the top players, but the scene is too small and too out of date (until a new great arena fps game comes along) for that to be likely.

I owe a great deal to the likes of Doom and Quake for giving rise to the genre of games that consumes all of my free time. But I have found myself faily unhyped for Doom 4. It looks very nice from a visual perspective, but as someone who has played the alpha, it isnt fast enough.

In multiplayer the gameplay feels heavily dumbed down with slow walk speeds, no form of skill based movement, 2 weapon carry limit and loadouts.

From a single player perspective it looks like it could be a bit of fun. I look forward to trying some custom campaigns, even if snapmap looks incredibly restrictive in terms of creating custom geometry and adding custom meshes. But the kill animations look tiresome and the gameplay is still very slow.

The only thing that can save Doom in my eyes is the modding community (if the game is even moddable which seems up in the air right now). Doom has always had a great modding community.

Single player mods to add speed, remove the rewards for kill animations and create brilliant custom levels with more freedom than snapmap offers.

Multiplayer tournament mods to re-balance weapons if necessary, change run speed, add more interesting movement, remove the carry limit and remove the loadouts.

Some way to make custom maps with custom geometry so we can see some truly great user made creations with complete freedom for creators. This would give us great competitive maps and single player levels. 

But sadly we dont know how moddable the game is at this point, if at all and snapmap doesnt look like it will cut it. I've heard reports that Doom wont be moddable and I've heard reports that it will be. I guess we'll have to wait and find out.

839,"It depends on the state of the thing they are cloning. For example Reflex is a clone of a mod for Quake 3. Its an old mod and an old game and the community is unlikely to ever see any growth because nobody is going to buy quake 3, patch it, install this old niche mod and join the incredibly hardcore remaining players.

Reflex creates a single, easy to use modern package on steam of similar gameplay, but included are, or will be, a built in map editor, replay editor, matchmaking, stats, tutorials and everything else you expect in modern games.

This in my opinion is a great way to do a spiritual successor. Simply cloning existing a functional games (like the lords of the fallen example) is a little sketchier, and if they are going to do it, they need to seriously improve on the base product.

Some examples of projects that seem to be more than just clones are:

* Insight - a stealth based arena shooter where making sounds makes you visible through walls, silent movement allows you to remain undetected.

* Wickland - kind of a dead project now but they created a duel game where weapons essentially act as transformations for your character, each with its own health bar so you have to keep them alive to use them

* Diabotical - not hugely innovative, but they have toyed with lots of ideas of brand new powerups, different movement, a unique take on the traditional quake weapons (rockets with inward splash, powerups that swap you with your opponent, gravity guns) but its not clear what the team has landed on as final

Coming up with an interesting and unique idea for your game gives people a reason to play it over all the other Quake and UT clones out there.

893,"First off, there is no ""failure"" of modern arena FPS, because there havent been any completed modern arena fps games for years. Nearly a decade. Declaring these new games as failures while they are still in alpha development is stupid. I'm not saying they will be successes, but its too early to say they wont be.

Secondly, you have to note that modern arena fps isnt getting a single AAA title developed for it unlike almost every other successful genre. Its not even getting titles from proper studios, regardless of their size. Every new arena fps title with any solid gameplay design is being made by a tiny dev team full of people working on a passion project in their bedrooms. Passion projects that are extremely hardcore products that cannot possibly have the tools to hold the hands of the average modern gamer yet because, as I said above, they are still being developed.

So what we have is a pool of extremely indie titles, that are extremely hardcore, and that arent even close to being finished. How could any genre in this state possibly still be thriving. Excluding Quake Live which is essentially a Q3 port, the last good quality and completed arena fps game we have gotten was, get this, Unreal Tournament 2004. So its been 12 years since Arena FPS has had a worthwhile contribution from an actual developer that has been completed.

How could a genre in this state possibly be anything but a ""failure""?

All negativity aside, as an Arena FPS gamer I can say that many of the new titles look really fun. The old games are STILL really fun. Every night I play Reflex and Quake Live. I'm really looking forward to Diabotical updates and to finally getting my hands on INSIGHT too. The scene is inevitably in a shit state from the amount of neglect its had in the last 12 years from actual studios, but the games our small scene is playing are tons of fun and we are still having a good time hosting tournaments, making maps and enjoying all the different flavours of duel fps games available to us.

Newer games have higher quality graphics and newer technology no doubt. But aesthetically and gameplay-wise its down to taste.

&gt; It might also be a question of what type of gamer you are. There are people who are always looking for ever bigger, crisper, more impressive experiences. 

If you are the type of gamer that wants the new HD experience with enourmous open worlds and technology not present in older games then I completely agree you should adopt the strategy you and ops friend mentioned of only playing new games.

925,"Some old games offer gameplay or aesthetics that you cant get in modern games. Completely subjective of course, but one of my favourite multiplayer FPS games is Quake World. 

Its from 1996 and if I want that extreme style of gameplay I have to go to QW. More recent quakes offer a much less insane style of combat and while I play them too, if I want some truly mental 1v1 duels with insnanely powerful guns, I have to go to QW

&gt; Yes, the older games are still great classics but newer iterations upon the established themes offer better controls, better visuals, better audio, etc.

Its not simply the case that new games offer the same experience in HD or the same experience but better. Sure it is for some games or in some peoples opinions, but not in a lot of cases. Sometimes a game came out in the 90s or early 2000s with gameplay, story or visuals that arent matched in your eyes by a modern game yet.

The point I'm making is that new or old makes no difference. Theres no correct way to do it based on your available time or anything else. Just play the games you enjoy regardless of their age. Looking back to older games is just as viable as looking only at modern games, its all taste

931,"I think that classes can sometimes shoehorn players into a certain style of gameplay, which isnt always a bad thing depending on the game, but games that allow a player to adopt any style they want from a single class or setup are brilliant in my opinion.

For example in Quake duel (or any other arena fps game), everyone plays as the same character, with the same starting health and starting weapon. Everything that happens after that is down to the individual players playstyle, map control and reactions to their opponents actions.

Every persons playstyle is different, in the top players, your group of friends, everyone. The base character gives complete freedom for you to play how you want and for you to switch playstyles on the fly and your ability to execute that playstyle is 100% down to you and not your characters stats. Some games with classes dont allow for this if the stats of that class make that new playstyle too difficult to pull off or completely not viable.

Its also good for balance of course as everyone is on a completely even footing.

But classes are a hit with a lot of people and there are definitely ways to make class based gameplay fun, competitive and balanced.

946,"&gt; I don't see anything wrong with using a controller to play games, yes it may not be precise as a mouse and keyboard but at a competitive level I don't think that matters as much especially when the same shooter isn't being played across all the platforms. 

Its not the person using the controller thats the problem, its what has been done to the games design to make it work with a controller.

&gt; I also don't see how having a controller over a keyboard and mouse makes a game so much slower that it makes it less exciting.

The players using a controller turn more slowly and less precisely in a game that is designed to be slower to compensate for that peripheral. Thats why its less exciting to some people.

Seeing someone hit a flick rail in quake to respond to a sudden attack is impressive because in a fraction of a second he spotted his opponent and was able to very quickly and very accurately flick his mouse a long distance to hit his opponent. I'm talking a shot that looks almost instant and robotic

In a console shooter this wouldnt be possible due to the time it takes to move the crosshair over an opponent and even if it was possible the achievement would be overshadowed by the fact that everyone watching knows his aim was assisted by the game

988,"&gt; The fact that all these games are just trying to clone Quake with new graphics doesn't mean anything.

New graphics, matchmaking, built in map editors, cosmetics and a ton of other things we dont have in Quake.

I'm a big Quake fan, and as a Quake fan I can tell you that to someone who understands the games, Reflex offers a very different experience. 

Different maps, different weapon balance, the vastly different movement to QL puts a completely different emphasis on different aspects of the games

Sure from the outside they look the same, but for Quake and Reflex players they are very different. The point of Reflex is to take the gameplay that we all love and bring it in to 2016

Something we sorely need as for nearly 10 years all we have had have been small indie titles without much ambition. Nearly a decade since a AAA company has made an Arena shooter. 

None of them currently have these modern features.

So the only game actually similar to Reflex from an AFPS player standpoint is CPMA which is a mod for a game from 1999 with a tiny playerbase.

The biggest current AFPS game is Quake Live which has very different gameplay to Reflex still has almost none of the features they are aiming for. Its not simply another pointless clone

I do agree that the genre needs innovation, but one game like Reflex is absolutely fine with me. One game to offer the classic experience I love in a modern package (Reflex) and I would hope that other devs aim to innovate and come up with new gameplay styles under the Arena FPS umbrella.

1012,"What he wants to do will give him a miniscule advantage. Its not really a big deal and its not going to win him any games and anyone could go ahead and do this on their smartphones

But the point is that he gets an advantage, no matter how small, from something outside of the game and himself. So if he learns the time and counts in his head, thats a player using his brain and the game to his advantage.

But if he uses something external, something not part of himself or the game to do this for him, then I would call that cheating. Even for something as trivial as this.

Its not like its a big deal, I'm just pointing it out. Part of what I like about competitive gaming is that you have the game, and you have your brain. These are the confines of the competition. 

Delegating any in game task to anything but yourself or something provided by the game is seeking an external advantage. If you cant count down the bomb time in your head, or if you dont have an excellent feeling for when it will blow based on in game experience, then you dont deserve to know because thats the point of competitive gaming.

You should be able to perform the tasks that you can intrinsicly perform as a player. If op could do these tasks capably and while keeping up his gameplay to a good standard he wouldnt be seeking this timing app, but he is, which means he cant do it. Not that its a bad thing that he cant do it, whats bad is that hes seeking a shortcut from something outside of himself and the game which decreases the skill gap between him and players that can do this by artificial means.

Arena FPS has taken a big hit in recent years. No non-indie developer has contributed a game to the genre since Quake 4 and UT3 which were bad games on release. Its been nearly 10 years since then and the scene has naturally dwindled.

Now finally we are getting some promising indie titles and the small scene is excited about it. The quality of the games is excellent but they are difficult, full of very talented players, and the size of the scene is so small that attracting new players to this hardcore small scene is both mandatory and very difficult.

So yeah the AFPS players are passionate about the genre, and yeah the scene is small, but the quality of the games is excellent and I dont think your comments about partially built products are justified just yet.

Do you have any complaints about Reflex as a game rather than about the size of its playerbase?

The microtransactions they added were 100% cosmetic and only there so that the people passionate about the game who were buying multiple copies to support the development, could instead by a cosmetic or 2 and do the same thing and get something to show for it.

&gt; Great story. It still doesn't change the fact that it's a game with a playerbase that struggles to reach 100 people on a good day.

The early alpha stage of the game and the lack of marketing during build phase is more than enough of a reason for this. Declaring it as failed during this phase is just stupid

If the writer is implying this as a general rule I completely disagree. Sure a 1 life per round thing works for CS, but Quake has an instant respawn system which makes it an extremely competitive game.

The point being that you die and instantly respawn as a weak, armourless and weaponless player at the mercy of your opponent until you can cleverly get yourself back into a good position to fight him again. It puts them on the back foot until they can find a way to break their opponents control of the map which can often take 2-3 minutes of clever play.

Even deeper than that are things like proper strategy. I have done so many 1v1 duels in quake its hard to count, but I still have a pretty basic understanding of duel strategy and have so much more to learn.

Even when watching streams casted by very proficient players they explain things I hadnt even considered or comprehended. And Quake isnt even an extreme example when it comes to mechanics, something like Reflex is far more mechanically intensive and offers 10x the amount of movement skills and tricks and timing nuances to learn.

I have played Reflex for 250 hours since it released last year and I still am a very average player, I cant do a lot of the jumps and my duel strategy is really lacking.

So if you have control, you've just killed your opponent, and then you heard them spawn nearby, depending on what items are near there spawn you can usually run at them and go nuts with rockets and get some conversion frags. 

If you know no items are spawning for a little while then you can probably keep doing this, but be careful not to kill them before a major item and have them spawn nearby and steal it

Another good time to do this is if your opponent is maintaining control really well and you cant find a way back into the game, its often worth sacrificing yourself to deal some insane damage to your opponent, and if you die, but you left them on low health, you might find yourself in a better position when you spawn and the control is up for grabs

I'm not the best person to ask about this though as I'm not a very aggressive player. You dont have to be, if you dont like playing aggressively or you arent good at it, then play to the strengths that you do have.

1136,"&gt; Why do arena fans not talk about unreal tournament 5

UT4 is the current UT game in development. Thats probably why.

Seriously though, lots of people in AFPS are talking about UT4. The community is pretty split with players on the Quakey-momentum based side of Arena FPS, and players who like the UT and Toxikk dodge jumping slower style of game.

A few people play both, but generally its seems like 2 seperate camps. Even on /r/ArenaFPS, UT doesnt get talked about as much as I think it should be. AFPS players are very love or hate about UT.

Its doing great though as a game and of course with epic behind it and the age old Unreal Tournament brand, its competing very handily with faster and more hardcore games like Reflex which has an easier job of piquing the interest of the hardcore AFPS community

I think currently Quake Live is the only AFPS game with more players than UT4 right now, so its doing very well. Out of all the AFPS games still in development (which is quite a lot) it has the most players.

I'm more of a Quake guy than an Unreal guy, but its undeniable that UT is doing well right now and is getting plenty of love from epic.",2015-12-03 16:19:50+00:00,cxlrl94,3.0,t1_cxlpl8x,3116.0,Games

You make progress in the sense that you have either increased your lead by 1 kill or closed the gap between you and your opponent by 1 kill.

In CTF or something you would have killed someone who has your flag, or wants to steal your flag or wants to kill your teams cappers or defenders which is what those kills are for

In fact, killing people in AFPS games is more of a big deal than most games because the opponent has to go and get weapons and armour when he spawns with nothing. In a team or 1v1 game you are setting back that player in a big way

From browsing different overwatch threads people complain about the following:

* Price

* That the game is too slow

* Too casual (easy ultimates that do the work for you for example)

I'm not sure if I'm going to get the game but I'd be really interested to see how it holds up. It is expensive, it does look insanely slow.

But I think the teamplay aspect could be pretty fun, so I'm reserving my final judgement for when I can play some proper 6 man pickup games of it.

You should look at how Reflex is doing it. They currently have released the game on early access, its still in alpha and very much a WIP, but they are gathering feedback from the dedicated players in a little development bubble

The passionate community is bettering the game by making maps, hosting tournaments and creating video content and HUDs while the developers make the game and soak up the feedback

People passionate about the Arena FPS genre buy the game, support the devs with their cash and then support with feedback and the community gets hyped and excited for the pretty hefty patches that keep on coming in

More and more content gets added with constant feedback from the community. Without a public Alpha I wouldnt have had a chance to play it yet for months and months in the future. Currently its the game I play the most and I jump on every evening. I payed just £7 for it, currently over 200 hours played, which is really impressive for a game that isnt even complete yet

You have to be cautious that if you leave an armour up your opponent has an opportunity to come back into the game by getting up to 150 armour pretty easily, so your next fight you have to be more careful, get better positioning, use the 50+ armour you have more than them and the extra mitigation of red over yellow to your benefit and win the next fight that way

Then when the fights over, youre at 50 armour and red is back up again, in QL you get the red first as a priority then grab anything you can after. In Reflex you can gamble, go grab the yellow if you know youre opponent is elsewhere, then get the red, that way youve denied 2 armours, but you cant do it the other way around because you cant get a yellow if youve just gotten red

But I will express my thoughts from a game I understand. In quake there is a very high skill cap and a very high strategy cap. In 1v1, you simply cannot get by with good aim.

As far at the top players go, even someone as bad as me effectively has a similar mechanical skill to a number 1 player like rapha. I can hit almost identical accuracies as he can, I can do the rocket jumps he can, I can hit the shots he can.

But in a duel against him I can 100% be certain I wouldnt get a single kill because his strategy and decision making would tear me apart. This may be the reverse of what you worry is going on in starcraft. But I can be sure that if I could beat rapha or get close to beating him or even get 10 kills against him simply because we have similar skill with the weapons and movement, I wouldnt play Quake at all

The fact that the game is so well balanced between how skillfull you are and the decisions you make is why its so good. If SC really does have a wall of micro/apm skill needed to beat other players then it is definitely a flawed game, though from the comments of other players it sounds like that isnt the case

A game like SC would ideally be mostly strategy, with mechanical skill and micro complimenting that strategy. You should be rewarded for good mechanical skill, but that shouldnt be a substitute for bad strategy in any competitive game",2015-11-16 16:50:53+00:00,cx279xd,1.0,t3_3sze2d,44384.0,Games

He typically doesnt care about what velderan has to say, nods until hes done talking and then says that basically velderan can do whatever he wants as long as he doesnt kill anyone or bother him again

Velderan has quite the reputation. At the front desk at the city watch there is a half dawrf, half dragonborn lady named Zanif. She is very jaded and the product of a lifetime of being sneered at and trodden upon. She hates everyone and especially Velderan.

Velderan is in love with Zanif however and has been trying to sweet talk her for years and is met with a cruel indifference. It often is very sad to witness and its been going on for a long time.

Finally Velderan set out on a quest, he aqquired some very fetching gems, upon his return he asked the greatest smith in the land (who owed him a favour) to fit these gems into a fine sword. He then marched to the city watch and up to Zanif and instead of demanding to see the commander as he usually did he gifted it to her.

But there is. I'll give you an example that makes sense to me. 

I'm going to buy Dark Souls 3. If I dont pre-order it I'm going to buy it on day 1.

Now if they tell me for pre-ordering it I can get 10% off and pre-load it, why wouldnt I do that. I have shit internet, I dont want to buy it when I get off work on release day and then wait all night for it to install. 

Why would I pay full price on release day when I can pay 90% a month before?

What if there are pre-order bonuses that I would like to have? Sure I could contribute to the war on pre-orders (though I dont know why I would as I have no issue with them) by not going in for that, or I could stop fighting a battle I dont care about and get those bonuses with no negative impact to myself.

Sometimes I am having a good month financially, if I can pre-order a game then rather than waiting until the month it comes out and not knowing what state my finances will be in then I would like to do that.

There are plenty of good reasons to pre-order. As someone who has never once been burned by a pre-order and has been playing games for decades, why should I all of a sudden abandon a practice thats brought me nothing but good things and convenience?

Though this is besides the point, I'm not annoyed that you guys hate pre-orders. I'm not annoyed that so many people just parrot TBs opinions (not that I'm including you in that, I dont know anything about you), I'm annoyed at how much people try to tell others off or how they should treat pre-orders when it has nothing to do with them

Cant check if the link works because work bans twitch. 

Deathmatch FPS games are pretty much 100% for PC because they simply dont work on a controller and require a mouse to make the rapid 180 motions or to strafe jump well, or the keyboard to quickly select one of the 8 weapons as well as actions like dropping guns, flags, powerups or using items or crouching.

Its been a little while since I watched this vid but I think the gist is that with the amount of time he spent with it, it wasnt bad. He was able to do some pretty tricky jumps on a map called THCT7 that require some perfect mouse movement

I think something like this will always be a step up from a controller, but a step down from the precision and speed of a mouse, but its interesting how well it worked for him as I was skeptical that it would be any better at all

UT is usually the game that people outside of the arena fps scene love, and people inside the AFPS scene arent often that fond of (though some still are). Its a strange paradigm as its one of the biggest names in the genre, but its kind of seen as the awkward cousin by most Arena FPS players

That being said, I still enjoy it a fair amount, and as someone who only plays arena fps games, I consider it to be the best UT game so far. Its also the best Arena FPS from a visual perspective. Its fucking gorgeous.

But for gameplay, its pretty far down the list. Jerky slow movement, spammy awkward weapons, way too high emphasis on shock combos, huge duel maps for such slow movement, the translocator makes for terrible CTF amongst other things

2) It looks slow for many of the characters. The ones that are fast have an uninteresting weapon rosters so it feels like a toss up

3) One weapon and a couple of activated abilities feels a little restrictive. It looks like playing the same hero will get old and you will need to switch often to keep it exciting

I dont know, it just feels too slow and restrictive. I cant help but compare it to Arena FPS games where you can move as fast as you are capable of moving (which is pretty fast for able players) and have sometimes 8 different guns on you to use at different times as well as items and powerups to make use of

I had the same issue with TF2 (though TF2 feels like you have many more gameplay options available to you per character).

There are more than 5 games in the works. Some of them look like they have real potential. The problem is they are so early in development that none of them are being marketed yet.

Reflex is an insanely good game that isnt being marketed until it is more user friendly and polished (makes sense)

Diabotical is a game with insane potential given how talented the dev is and the number of talented people behind it (as well as the connections and esports fame of 2GD who is the lead on the project) but it is also in a really primitive stage

UT is constantly evolving and always does well at attracting the more casual audience and people from other genres

Quake 5 is rumoured, Doom 4 could be pretty fun with some community input in game modes and maps and there are many more games.

We just need some of them to get near to being finished, start being marketed and to have some big prize pool tournaments but its unfortunately a little early for that now. So perhaps 2016 isnt a bad estimate

1319,"&gt; Quake fans may want Quake, but the fact is that for the average person, Quake is no longer an option. Now it's just pay nothing for Unreal Tournament, or pay $10 for Quake. Very easy choice to make.

But they are different games, so its not simply a case of picking the cheapest. A consumer will pick the one that interests them the most. £6.99 is not a lot of money to a lot of people buying games

&gt; Also I should remind you that it's fully possible to mod Quake-style physics into UT so eventually you'll probably get a mod that just makes it flat-out better for both parties.

Something like this would never have the playerbase QL has, or all the great maps, or all the server gameplay options (unless someone wanted to make mods for those too).

You also need to take into account that in the arena fps community, UT is the awkward unpopular one. Even on the sub I mod based on Arena FPS, quite often UT posts will get completely downvoted simply because its UT

UT always does a great job of appealing to the casual gamer, but AFPS fans very often dislike it. This means there will always be a large portion of the hardcore crowd always playing more momentum based games like Quake and Reflex (and these are typically the players that stick around for decades)

In quake you are alone, 1v1. You spawn with a shit weapon and 100 health. To move around you need to strafe jump/bunnyhop, in games like reflex you need to do much much more to move around and all these movement techniques require learning and practicing before you can ever use them in a game

Then theres item control, timing, tracking your stack, tracking their stack, mastering the completely different weapon styles.

When you first pick up quake and jump into 1v1 you will lose your first 200 games unless you have other noobs to play with. I've been playing for 13 years and I am considered an average/low skill quake player.

I can strafe jump excellently, have reasonable aim, good combat skills, very good timing and I still lose about 70% of my pub games.

Quake is just hard. Not to say CS isnt, but things like simple movement (bhopping is not a necessity to play CS capably), getting lucky headshots or low TTK and the enourmous amount of players you can be evenly matched with as well as the fact that you have 4 team mates to take the focus off you just makes CS a much more friendly and forgiving experience despite how great it is at a high level

The 3 I am recommending to people these days are Reflex, UT4 and Quake Live

**Reflex** - extremely fast, very complex movement, in alpha and sold on steam. Healthy tournament scene, especially given how early in development it is

**UT4** - Slowest of the three, it is free and also in alpha/beta. Looks visually stunning, doesnt have a thriving tournament scene yet but perhaps it will 

**Quake Live** - Most populated of the three (and the entire genre), free on steam, faster than UT but slower than Reflex. Looks like the devs are about to drop support for the game after the upcoming patch (speculation)

Games like UT4 and Reflex are the future, but QL isnt a game to pass up and has a lot of players for the genre. ",2015-10-08 17:49:36+00:00,cvspw51,1.0,t3_3nzx42,481.0,ArenaFPS
1429,"&gt; True. And on higher levels i would arguably say that CSGO relies heavily on good movement

You can bhop slowly for flair points and occasionally for an advantage but the game does not rely heavily on good movement. Dont confuse movement with positioning

&gt; Many AFPS games have lots of vertical mapdesign. But I dont see that as a requirement. I'd rather see that the game has good mapdesign

I have never played an afps in my life with horizontal maps. Like it or not, its a big part of the genre

&gt; If we are assuming that the player in Quake and CS are the same, I'd say that CS maps usually are smaller then Quake CTF maps. Also that Quake maps are more vertical, their duel maps are rather large(volumevice).

Maybe the phrase ""tight maps"" would have been better. There are very rarely large open areas and you can always get from one side to the other in less than 10 seconds for duel maps

&gt; I enjoy this type of gameplay as well. But CSGOs Economy system is a great system as well and shouldn't be dismissed, as it has loads of gameplay depth

I'm not saying the economy system is bad, just that I dont consider it an element of afps games

&gt; I'd rather say that this is all about mapcontrol. And that's what CS is all about

Controlling positions and stacking up via item control are different things. I'm not saying CS version of map control is bad, just that controlling items on the map is a feature I consider to be a large part of afps (given that its in every single one)

&gt; I love the diversity in the weapon arsenal in AFPS games! I can't argue against it! But CSGO still has a diverse array of weapon even thou, they're all calculated with raycasts.

Again, I'm not dissing the weapons in CS, I'm just saying they arent what I would consider a weapon arsenal of an AFPS game

&gt; As Overwatch hasn't been released yet, I can't say much about it. But with what I have seen from it in mind, I'd rather say that it is more MOBA oriented. I feel like it caters more to the mainstream audience, that is playing Dota 2, COD and battlefield. And I feel like blizzard is just making Overwatch to be like Hearthstone is to other TCG's out there... It feels really casual compared to most FPS games

I dont think overwatch is an afps or even going to be a good game. I'm just saying that its closer to an afps than CS (while still not being one)",2015-10-08 17:44:40+00:00,cvsposc,5.0,t1_cvsl9ph,6441.0,ArenaFPS
1430,"&gt; Every weapon has a predictable spray pattern that you can control by memorizing the proper mouse movement and adjusting for distance.

What I'm saying is that you cant remember the exact placement of every bullet, only the gist of the shape and direction the spray takes

1431,"What exactly do you think it has in common with AFPS games. There is no official definition but I personally see AFPS games as:

* fast

* heavily movement based

* verticality

* small maps (comapred to most fps games)

* on map item pickups

* spawning with a shit weapon while the better weapons can be found around the map

* item control

* focus on projectile as well as hitscan

Overwatch meets more of these things than CS by a long shot and even that I dont consider to be a full on AFPS",2015-10-08 12:34:10+00:00,cvse9no,3.0,t1_cvsc4bf,6935.0,ArenaFPS
1432,"Spray patterns arent RNG, but nobody can predict them 100% accurately so its kind of the same thing, just not completely random because you know the gist of where they will go, just not the exact positions

In quake the bullets or projectiles go exactly where you want them, in CS you kind of know the path they will take and can do your best to accomodate for this but its still guess work because you only know the general area in which the bullets wil go, not the exact placement of each one

Its also kind of a non skill. There isnt much depth to it and its not fun, interesting or rewarding. Its more of a necessary annoyance (because it would be even lower TTK if there was no spread at all and bullets did exactly what you wanted).

Double edged sword. For CS gameplay you need it, but the skill itself is not one I personally deem impressive or in depth. ",2015-10-08 12:30:59+00:00,cvse6wh,3.0,t1_cvsbvgi,7768.0,ArenaFPS

* clear objectives are good for spectating

* solid matchmaking

* I like the emphasis on positioning and teamwork

* the strategy in grenade use

Bad:

* I dont like spread control as a skill

* I dont like low TTK

* lots of waiting and looking at corners

* while I like that the game requires good positioning, the emphasis is too high on that over other skills

* slow

* boring weapons

* boring movement

* horizontal as fuck

* accidental headshots and lucky bullet spam is too common and rewarding

Its ok. I just get bored of it fast. I have played maybe 20 matchmaking games (and some 1.6/source when I was younger) to give it a really good try before dismissing it but I just got bored.

1434,"&gt; Well when it comes down to close range fights, rockets have most potential dps. You can create situations where the actual skill to hit rockets matters a lot less. If you're being chased, it gets very easy to lead the opponent and score some directs.

&gt; Or you can abuse positioning(guarding items, higher ground, etc.)

I agree with all of this. Thats not what I was disputing. I'm just saying that there will be times where you get jumped or find yourself in a pickle and just need to do the best rockets you can because there isnt a better option 

I agree you should work as hard as possible to make this not happen if your RL is worse than your enemies and I agree in lots of fights you have a wide range of positioning options and weapon options available to you

But sometimes, youve just gotta take the RLvRL fight and hope you do well enough because its your only option",2015-10-08 10:23:17+00:00,cvsbwde,6.0,t1_cvsbhto,1772.0,reflex
1435,"&gt; This is only true if you have less than 50 health. You can always rocket jump to create distance.

Its almost always more optimal to take the fight and hit 2 good rockets to your opponents 3 good rockets than it is to try to rocket jump out of a sticky situation and risk getting fucked up on your way out

That only works if you have a reasonable amount of space and a good place to jump to and even then it may be better to just risk the fight unless you are unlikely to win

There are ALWAYS a few times during a game where you are in a RL fight you just cant avoid and have to settle for doing as much damage as possible. Rocket jumping away is almost always going to do more harm than good if the situation isnt very right for it

But I agree that sometimes thats an option. Just far less so than taking the fight",2015-10-08 09:36:18+00:00,cvsb9gk,6.0,t1_cvsb78b,277.0,reflex

Reflex also seems to have a much more engaged community who are running lots of tournaments and making hundreds and hundreds of maps, some of which are really excellent

1475,"You could not be more wrong. The video you linked is of a completely basic jump that any QL player who isnt a complete newbie can do

&gt; I'm sure you'll be hard pressed to find someone doing stairs like that in normal quake

You cant do it in normal quake because vq3 doesnt have stair jumps programmed in. Its not down to their speed, its down to the movement options the game provides

I play both games a lot. Pulling off a solid stair jump to red on cpm22 with reflex or cpm physics is many times more difficult than simply doing a basic strafejump to the red platform in QL.

QL even has clipping that makes the basic strafe jump to red even easier

The extent of QLs difficulty is strafe jumping and circle jumping. Reflex has many more methods of movement like tele, cieling, stair, double and triple jumps as well as everything QL has and as well as the fact that the added speed means you need to work faster to chain all these more complex jumps together

Both games have complex movement, but reflex is far more difficult. I can strafe jump to red on aero 10/10 times in QL and I am not a good player. I might pull off a cpm/reflex stair jump 3 out of 10 attempts. 

I'm not trying to be rude but you simply sound uninformed. Saying QL is more complex in movement is an opinion, an opinion nobody on this earth possesses, but an opinion.

But at least in AFPS games the trend seems to be to only reward objectives in objective games so hopefully you can find some enjoyment in QL CTF for now.

I still prefer the movement in Quake 4 for duelling over any other movement scheme in arena fps games. The balance is essentially the same as QL which is near perfect in my opinion. It had great maps and great map makers.

Gameplay-wise its completely solid and while I think its shitty build quality is worth mocking into the ground, dont drag the gameplay down with it",2015-08-21 08:49:33+00:00,cuagu1p,1.0,t3_3hs5ea,34163.0,Games
1663,"Quake Live in terms of competitive play didnt change.

Competitive players are still playing QL in the same way as they always have done. I'll explain in bullet points whats going on for full clarification

* QL devs added loadouts to FFA and TDM in official iD hosted servers only

* Community got angry, but most hardcore players werent playing FFA and hardcore TDM players play pickup games on Classic servers which dont have loadouts anyway

* CTF didnt get loadouts, CA was unchanged, Duel (the main competitive mode) wasnt affected at all and remained as it always has done (loadout free, item timer free)

So really very little changed at all except for casual FFA (for which there are still Classic servers) and pub TDM (which is a gametype which never saw pub play anyway and was pretty much always done in pickup games)

So no, QL didnt get shit, very little changed and whats more the loadouts are being removed as the default setting in an upcoming patch (so if you want a game with loadouts you will have to set that on a custom server. default servers will be back to normal)

Anyone who is a frequent QL player has probably had their experience changed very little (unless they are a FFA player) and is almost certainly still playing without loadouts",2015-08-20 12:18:50+00:00,cu9dvxl,3.0,t1_cu9dkxh,839.0,Games

Its more of a cpma clone than a regular Q3 clone. Quake 3 gameplay is very different and much slower than Reflex.

Reflex was a game that most of the arena fps community was throthing at the mouth to get their hands on. The devs went to kickstarter but fell short of their goal.

The community worried that this meant they would have to wait even longer to get hold of the game. The KS said 2016 before Alpha access or something like that.

But after the failed KS the devs put the game on Early Access. The Arena FPS community was thrilled and lots of us bought the game. The devs were able to use the money to continue the development and pay for art assets and such while the community got into the game, started creating maps and hosting tournaments.

The game is still in Early Access, the devs are still able to develop it due to the money coming in and are pushing out frequent updates and the player count is growing, hosting more tournaments, making more maps and huds and a real community is starting to form.

The biggest difference between reflex and quake live is the movement. QL is a MUCH slower game due to the fact that reflex has double jumps, triple jumps, stake jumps, air strafing/bunnyhopping, cieling jumps. None of which are doable in QL

The additions to the movement make Reflex at least twice as fast. Reflex also has different weapon balance and a bunch of community mappers that have created hundreds of maps unique to reflex that the community uses in Reflex tournaments

Not only that but the game is still alpha, and as far as I know we are only seeing the early stages of the gameplay. Lots is still open to be changed.

The game reflex is similar to is CPMA which is a mod for Q3 with a very small community. Just like wc3 dota was a mod that was made into a full game, Q3cpma is the game that inspired the devs (who worked on CPMA) to make Reflex which is a spiritual successor to it.

I've been playing arena fps games for nearly 15 years and I am considered a low skill quake player. There are small tournaments you can enter very often as well as pickup games which are very challenging.

Calculating your enemies stack, where they are, when each individual item will respawn, which route to take for best positioning, whether you can afford to contest an item, what guns you have and what doors that opens up for you. All of this stuff has to be done every few seconds in quake and before every decision is made and it involves a lot of mentally keeping track of things.

Especially timing items and keeping track of how much damage you are doing to your opponent and how much more they can take based on which route they took and what armour or health was available to them a the time they took that route

You want a high skill cap, quake live is the way to go. CTF, TDM and Duel are all played competitively, Duel being the one with the highest skill cap",2015-07-27 13:45:56+00:00,cthqbwd,1.0,t3_3er0xq,19293.0,gaming

You need something like that. If you just make a bog standard arena fps game you will fall very far down the ladder behind dev teams of very talented programmers and skilled artists.

Chams is another game doing this. Its a single dev with limited resources, but hes creating a sound based arena fps where making sounds makes you visible through walls which is a unique idea and definitely gives me a reason to play it

Your mouse and keyboard are on a desk. Not being able to walk around with them is not a fault of a mouse and keyboard. Being able to hold a controller isnt a plus

I've never experienced this problem myself. None of my friends playing any of those games have complained

This is the opposite of a good thing. You cant use a mouse and keyboard whereas pc users can use either m+kb or a controller

&gt; Console games aren't stuck in an Eternal Beta Phase (unlike PC games, which are). 

What does this even mean? I cant think of a game I play or have played that is stuck in a beta phase. Some games have beta phases, but we get more access to them on pc than on console and I like being in games from beta stage if I am interested in them. Alpha stage is even better

A game designed for a mouse and keyboard has much more freedom and control than a game designed for a controller

ARTS = Moba. Good attempt at humour though

&gt; Which I guess is why all portable game devices use M&amp;Kb instead...

Controllers are much better to carry around, much worse to game on. You can have a point for being easy to hold on a train if you like, even if it is a bad experience for actual gaming

&gt; Considering that according to reputable PCMR source DIGITAL FOUNDRY you need a $600 PC to run Witcher 3 at PS4 level, I'd say you either don't know what you're talking about... or you flat-out

* Exclusives (although more games are exclusive to pc than are to xbox)",2015-07-21 13:43:58+00:00,ctaun59,12.0,t1_ctaubek,665.0,gaming
1850,"I dont have a powerful PC but I have a 144hz monitor for highly optimised FPS games. Quake, Reflex, Xonotic, Wickland, Warsow, Unreal Tournament. I run all of them at a cap of 150fps (they can run comfortably at 300).

I'm pretty sure the vast majority of counter strike players will do the same as that game is really well optimised. My friend plays it at 120fps on an old laptop.

Also mobas and RTS games are really well optimised and can run pretty nicely on mid range machines",2015-07-21 13:30:00+00:00,ctau8f3,3.0,t1_ct9ghom,111009.0,pcgaming
1851,"&gt; IF the game requires such an unwieldy input device. ;-) 

Basically any first person game, any strategy game and any arts game. Also digital card games and board games make good use of them too.

The problem is that games are being slowed down and dumbed down to accomodate controllers which is the big issue. If the controller cant keep up with video games to the point where the games themselves need nerfing to make controllers viable then they arent a good peripheral option

The controller is the unwieldly device

&gt; ... on rock-bottom settings. ;-) 

No, they are settings that will look better than a console AND run at over double the framerate.",2015-07-21 13:03:46+00:00,ctatiwq,10.0,t1_ctat9t5,587.0,gaming
1852,"&gt; resorting to cumbersome M&amp;Kb

Cumbersome? Its the quickets and most fluid way of playing. A controller is the definition of a cumbersome way to control a game character

&gt; It is merely this continued legacy of old PC-born genres that still justifies M&amp;Kb for gaming at all.

That and how much better you can play with them. Try going against a m+kb user in an fps game. Or try playing a deep rts game.

&gt; So basically, you are running PONG. 

You picked one out the list I mentioned. But yes quake is easiest to run out of that list. I play every quake from 1 to 4 to live. Each other them going at ~300fps. The other games are much more recent, reflex being from 2014.

Even if I delve into some casual single player AAA things that you seem to think are the only games worth playing I am running them at around 100fps.

I would really hate to be capped at 60fps, moving around with a controller on already obselete hardware that I payed 300 bucks for. But the main reason I play on PC is the games. None of the games I play and enjoy on a day to day basis are even available on consoles, and if they were, it would be a terrible, capped framerate, janky controller using experience

All the other things that pc does better than console are just a bonus",2015-07-21 12:38:05+00:00,ctasvpq,8.0,t1_ctasm2n,725.0,gaming
1853,"All of your comments were wrong, but ill pick a few out.

&gt; Other than for legacy reasons, nobody wants to game with M&amp;Kb. They tried on console, but since joypads already were the standard there, nobody gave a sh!t. 

M+KB are much faster and give much greater control as well as having a whole bunch of bindable space for actions. Try playng Quake or starcraft on a console and you would see why its not doable with a gamepad. I do use a controller for some games like fighting and driving games, but not for fps, rts, mmo or anything else

&gt; Either you're running PONG on that PC... or you've got some deeeeeep gaming wallet there. LOL 

My pc cost £500 and I primarily bought it for work. I play FPS games like Quake, Reflex, CSGO and some moba games like Dota 2 (again games that arent playable on console or play terrbily with a gamepad)

* Access to arena fps, RTS, MMO and Moba games that you wouldnt not be able to play with a controller on console

* Upgradable so you dont have to buy a new system

* Free multiplayer

* Open platform (not restricted to XBLIVE or PSN) so you can have all your friends on skype or team speak or mumble, all your games on steam or gog or on disc or  frmo whatever store you want

* Multitasking with multiple monitors

Another thing overwatch suffers from is restrictive class based gameplay. I dont like the idea of only having 1 gun. One of the reasons I love afps games is that I can have a bunch of weapons all with different uses at the same time and use 3 or 4 of them in one fight to serve different purposes.

1980,"Sounds like you need some Quake Live in your life my friend.

* 1v1 

* TDM (classic not loadout version)

* CTF (classic or default. neither have loadouts)

Duel (1v1) has an insanely high skill curve and requires very impressive strategy and decision making to come out on top. Often its about making the best out of a terrible situation, and if you are in a good situation its about working your ass off to keep it that way and not lose control of the major items

CTF and TDM at any reasonable level take huge amounts of skill (especially for cappers in ctf), communication (just watch any tdm team currently practicing for quakecon) and planning.

You need to be able to keep track of the quad damage timer, the regenration, haste, mega health, red armour. You need to inform your team mates who has quad, how much health they have, if enemies are in your base, which way the opposing team is taking your flag, drop weapons for your freshly spawned team mates, drop powerups for the guy holding the enemy flag, in tdm you even need to time the weapons in lots of cases as well as everything else and on top of all this you need to be able to strafe jump, circle jump, rocket jump and aim your weapons at a high enough level to be able to fight and know which guns to use, when to switch to a shit gun so your opponents can pick up your good gun if they kill you.

Look no further if you want a challenging fps.

There is definitely room for your style of play in quake and while most tournaments are 1v1, team games have a competitive scene too, At this years quakecon (end of this month) it is a team competition including TDM and CTF tournaments.

There are pickup channels for TDM and CTF and they play very often (not sure of the actual channel names). There are also pretty high skill CTF servers in the evenings with some really high level players in them so you can take advantage of these.

Make a team and enter some cups. Keep an eye on ESR, or plusforward or something for cup dates. They crop up fairly regularly.

1982,"&gt;  Once you get the hang of things it's not any harder than most pre-6th gen games.

I find that Dark Souls without any guides or player summons is one of the hardest single player gaming experiences I have had in recent years.

I just finished a no guide, no summon playthrough of sotfs + dlc and it was insane. I was constantly lost. I would spend days searching for a path or a way to get through a door.

I would fight bosses that I would learn afterwards were completely optional. 

The final fight in the dlc against the burnt ivory king was so difficult. It took me days of retrying. I nearly ran out of effigys (and I was only using them when my health bar got super low).

I found out afterwards that you could get more of the little soldier guys to help you but without a guide I had no idea. And I still dont think it would have gotten much easier.

I did a second playthrough afterwards where I used guides, got items I didnt know existed, played with other players, avoided bosses I didnt need/want to fight and all that stuff and it was no more difficult than any other rpg.

Simply not knowing makes a big difference, often much more than how good you are at dark souls combat and boss fights. A lot of my friends talk about how dark souls isnt that tough while hitting google whenever they dont know where to go or summoning 3 other players to take on the pursuer",2015-07-07 12:28:46+00:00,csuw12d,3.0,t1_csu6clb,58667.0,Games

All the different games are competiting to try and be the next big game and Doom has the potential to be one of the heavy hitters, but there are plenty of reasons why that may never happen

Heres to hoping it does though

The lightning gun in QW, Q3, QL and Q4 is a brilliant gun to use. 

* Its fun to leviatate your opponents with its knockback when they are jumping down on top of you.

* Its fun to push them back as they try to jump for a major item in front of you.

* Its fun to boost your team mates by shooting them in the back as they head to your base with the enemy teams flag.

* The noise it makes when you hit a particularily good stream on your oppenent is unbelievably satisfying.

* Waiting silently at the top of a jump pad while your opponent jumps up, unaware you are there and you can catch him with 100% lg is just exquisite.

Got a quad damage? Got an lg? Got 150 cells? Get up in that enemy base son because the other team is about to weep as you, the god of thunder for 30 seconds, unleashes 18 dmg per cell on your opponents.

All hail the Lightning gun and sorry to everyone I duel against for being an LG whore
