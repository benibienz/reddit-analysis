1,"Well you like Terraria, you like metal, etc... Wouldn't you like to appear in some episode? I don't see why not! XD",2015-06-24 21:59:36+00:00,cshkd0q,4,t1_csglg72,73413,Terraria
2,"My favorite genres are Progressive Metal, Metalcore (not really some of the emo ones tho) and Trash Metal, but I kinda hear a bit of everything! :)

If you still are curious latelly I have been listening to (aka what I have in my mp3) Suicide Silent, Cannibal Corpse, Dream Theater, Pantera, Ayeron, Lamb of God, Nevermore and Disturbed.

And this is my band page (kinda rubbish tho, we will update it with some photoshotting and some single releases in Agust/September) : https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dark-Art/994162247290940

3,"""or are you just trying to capture the dull, glazed-over stare people naturally develop while playing games otherwise"" Kinda yeah... XD

Just kidding, my objective is not to only capture that, but I do so people that like my looks and some facial reactions can enjoy. 

Think about it has a semi-useless perk! XD",2015-06-23 21:11:21+00:00,csgcham,2,t1_csfpedp,46685,Terraria
4,"It seens like u guys had a lot of fun!

If you want a suggestion, after I get tired of sandbox games like terraria, don't starve, minecraft, etc... I allways try to look up into the modding community, I'm sure you 2 will have even more fun! :)",2015-06-21 19:35:36+00:00,cse1rq3,1,t3_3ams9s,264,Terraria
5,"Daniel, it is a system problem, it happens because I tried to install a driver that was suposed to improve the microphone sound system and it actually f**** it up (i think u can check the microphone working normally on my first video if you want to do so). 

I must admit, my camara isn't very good (even tho I'm really into buying a new webcam) and my microphone well, it's not the best at all (that's why I tried to install the drivers) but for now, IF i'm able to correct my mistake I will keep this microphone until I'm able to buy a new one.

Anyways, thank you for your criticism, I'm not going into something serious since I only record gameplays for fun. But that's not an excuse to not improve it, besides that, it's always good to know that there is someone that is able to do serious and helpfull recomendations like you.

Cheers mate! :)",2015-06-21 18:50:50+00:00,cse0fm7,2,t1_cse06k2,507,Terraria
6,The funny thing is that I wrote it right on youtube (where almost no one will see it) but I made a mistake here on reddit where a lot of Terraria players are able to see it! XD ,2015-06-21 18:35:54+00:00,csdzzos,2,t1_csdzv1v,260,Terraria
7,"Hi everyone this is the first episode of my let's play of Terraria.

In this episode you probably won't find nothing really interessting since this is the first episode but if you liked it stay tunned because I will try to upload a new terraria video everyday (exept for saturdays and sundays)!

PS: I hope I'm not doing anything agains't the rules by self promoting myself.",2015-06-21 18:12:46+00:00,csdzamc,1,t3_3amixw,194,Terraria
