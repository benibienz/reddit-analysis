**Positive things:**

1) You get to play the role you want most of the time. To increase your chances, pick Mid as the secondary role.

2) Toxicity and trolling has been reduced because of that.

3) You get to play ranked games with friends, whereas until now you could only play normals.

4) Now 3 different people get to ban, not only the 1st pick.

5) You get to show your team what you want to play, to avoid getting it banned.

6) For those that love watching streams, it's hilarious when an LCS team queue as 5 and troll games, but end up winning because they're much better. Don't forget we got to see dynamic queue CLG vs TSM one day before LCS started, and the 2 results were the same ;)



**Negative things:**

1) The new champ select seems to be taking forever. I mean, declaring the champion you'd like to play takes 40 seconds, and now only 1 person gets to pick when the time comes, not 2 as it was with the old champ select (excluding 1st and last pick).

2) People seem to get irritated with the fact that you now get to hear every single champion's quote, not just yours. (not entirely a negative thing, but let's list it). Easily solved by disabling SFX in your client ;)

3) There have been reports that some people do not pick a champion for their role and instead go to other lanes (e.g. you queue as Mid and decide to Jungle). Riot has stated that this is ban worthy, but you get to play the entire game before you can report. Maybe some kind of a report system in the champ select can prevent this trolling from ruining your game.

4) Has anyone else noticed that in normal games, the lobby owner is NOT the 1st pick, the lobby creator is the 1st pick. You can create a lobby, then give leadership to your friend, but you'll be 1st pick, not your friend. I haven't tested it now that they updated the champ select, but that was the case before.

Let's discuss other advantages and disadvantages!
