As far as I understand that is what they're supposed to do.

59,"In college I worked in a hardware store (part of a now defunct UK chain called Focus which was kind of like Lowes but most of the stores were half the size). One autumn we had a terrible rat problem, we got pest control in but it didn't help much. Eventually they worked out that something in the birdseed we sold was an antidote to the rat poison so we stopped stocking it and they started to die off.

One day I go the warehouse for something and pick up this faint stench, the warehouse guys tells me it started a couple of days ago but they don't know what it is because they cleared out all the dead rats and searched the place top to bottom. This continued for days, then weeks. It was awful and you could only be in there for minutes at a time when the back door was shut. Eventually the smell peaked, but it never went away for literally months.

One day, about 8 or 9 week later, one of my illustrious colleagues sold a bathroom suite which went out for delivery the same day as the truck happened to be loading up. Off we go to the warehouse to give the forklift guy the paperwork and give him a hand moving stuff (you can probably see where this is going), anyway he drives over to the bathroom pallets and lifts up the one we want revealing the totally pancaked &amp; mummified remains of some kind of rat king (not a literal rat king, just a big fucking rat). By that point the smell couldn't get any worse but it was gross, we scraped up the corpse with a spade and sealed it in about 8 layers of plastic and threw it in the dumpster.

I worked there for 2 more years and the smell never went away fully (it did get more tolerable in the warehouse after a while though), I can still smell that stench when I think about it, it will never leave me. On the plus side knowing the smell of a dead rat means you can identify some places you don't want to be real fast.

TL:DR Worked at a hardware store where someone accidentally crushed a rat under a pallet of bathroom suites where it putrefied and stank up the place before we found it a few months later. Smell never left either the store or my soul.

Bad Checks; Curfew/Loitering/Vagrancy Violations; Disorderly Conduct; Driving Under the Influence; Drunkenness; Non-Violent Family Offenses; Liquor Law Violations; Peeping Tom; Trespass of Real Property; and All Other Non-Traffic Offenses.

But here's the thing, the biggest thing about this whole motherfucking thread. I never claimed 594 lowered the violent crime rate. You've just inferred it. I mean, shit, just look at the first comment here, my whole point is that WE DON'T KNOW.

164,"So I recently drove from CA back to Seattle. Here's some of the things that stand out from that trip:

Unsafe undertaking: left lane campers annoy everyone, but where it gets dangerous is when there is traffic but the road speed is still high and complete idiots decide that the line that has formed in the left lane (we're talking like 15 cars in line here or more) isn't for them and do wild, unsafe undertaking manoeuvres (sometimes rapidly cross 3 lanes back and forth) to tuck into a gap that isn't close to wide enough for them. All to move one car length further up. Rinse and repeat.

Small gaps: related to above, people often leave smaller gaps because of wanting to shut out idiot drivers doing unsafe undertaking etc. But in general tailgating and just lack of concentration leads to more accidents. Saw this yesterday, when a Honda fit was forced to dive into the HOV lane because the van in front of them slammed on their brakes in stop-and-go traffic.

Moving between lanes: seriously, rapid moving between lanes in traffic is a nightmare, people pulling out into faster moving traffic from stop-and-go lanes. So, SO dangerous.

Zipper merging: I think getting information on how zipper merging actually benefits everyone would be huge. People don't know about it and so they close gaps and force people to make unsafe merges because they view people as ""jumping the line"" or something. This is ESPECIALLY true of the NB I-5 express lanes entrance, it's a total mess because of this.

Also while we're at it. Yesterday while at the I-5 on ramp at 405 in Lynnwood I was overtaken by 18 cars in the HOV on ramp before I got to the meter. Fully 2 of them had 2+ visible passengers. You need to do something about this. HOV lane abuse it beyond ridiculous at this point.

If the landlord decides to be a mega-dick and changes the locks on you or anything rather than complying with your reasonable demand for pro-rated rent, then congrats, you've just won the small claims court lottery and you'll be getting more back than half a month pro-rated that's for sure.

On the other hand if you're thinking of packing it in a checked bag and you're going to a non-legal weed state, then you could be in for a whole heap of trouble since TSA do have drug sniffing dogs doing random baggage checks. It's probably not a high risk, but still significant.

262,"The tribe comment was more an (admittedly cheap shot) comment on why should the descendant of immigrants be telling another immigrant that they shouldn't be allowed to own a home because it might compete with them.

&gt;First of all, as a foreign national you aren't in any position to tell me or any other American what our laws and values should be. You're also factually wrong.

If you're unfamiliar with the wording of the Declaration of Independence, it is widely available online. I am not trying to tell you what your laws or values should be, I'm telling you what they are. All men are created equal is a founding tenant of this nation. And as you clearly said I am entitled to the same protections under the constitution as you are.

To address your long list, firearm ownership (which, FYI, in the state of Washington I am permitted to own a firearm as a non-citizen and permanent residence have zero restrictions on firearm ownership nationwide) is not a universal right for Citizens, nor is voting, nor is holding political office. All these rights can be revoked from you under the right set of circumstances, it does not remove my equal protections under the constitution the supreme court has just determined such exceptions are legal for non-citizens, as they have for criminals or those impeached etc etc. Also once you are a citizen of the US for many countries you are required to revoke your natural citizenship, meaning that the US cannot revoke citizenship as it would leave the person stateless, which is a treaty violation (I might be wrong on this), plus the US doesnt actually recognize dual citizenship anyway. Also I can open a bank account anywhere without proof of a visa - I've done it twice.

Only someone who has never lived as an immigrant would say that immigrants ""quickly forget they are guests"" trust me, not a day goes by when I don't think about that fact, and about how lucky I am to be here. It is a great privilege that I have to be a guest in your country, one that I have earned through a lot of work and effort. As immigrants we know going in we don't have all the same opportunities that you do, the same governmental support structure for example, but we do have the same constitutional rights. That includes the right to be treated equally and fairly for something like the ability to have a home to live in. To even be in this country H1B visas (which, btw, I am not one) can only be issued if they company can show such a hire will not adversely effect a US citizen worker i.e. you cannot hire for a position that could be filled by an American, so right out of the gate the Citizens are (rightly) being put first, that should be enough of a leg up.

I do not question your right to be here (and forgive me if I gave that impression) as I said the tribe comment was a cheap shot, merely aimed at highlighting the fact that I suspect you are here because of immigration. And that you may not be here if governments of the past were allowed to stipulate such rules which you are advocating for.

277,"Is this in the sidebar? I think we should have a rental questions sticky because we get this a lot, anyhow:

Your landlord has violated the RCW in about 3 different ways. If there was no check-in list the landlord does not have a right to withhold any of your deposit. Period.

Additionally rent CANNOT be used in any way shape or form towards a deposit

Lastly he has not given you close to the correct notice period for raising rent.

So, here's what you do. Email your landlord and (if you can) send him a copy of the letter in certified mail. Find the relevant portions of the RCW (and SMC for the notice period), highlight them and attach to the letter. Demand (politely, forcefully but do no not say anything that may be construed as blackmail) the entirety of your damage &amp; pet deposit back, along with the extra rent. Let your landlord know they have 10 days (arbitrary you can pick any period you think is reasonable) to respond with the money or you will open a small claims case to recover what is rightfully yours.

This should hopefully get them to give you it back with the minimum of fuss. In making these violations the landlord has made several bad faith violations of the law, which means a small claims court can also award you damages in addition to the rightful return of your rent and deposits. Do not be afraid to open a claim, you will most likely win.

The RCW required them to provide you a number where they can be contacted. If they leave you a number where they cannot be contacted you have grounds to reasonably refuse consent for them to enter. You can do this by putting a notice on your door for your landlord. State clearly that you were unable to contact them and also unable to make arrangements on such short notice and that you do not give consent for them to enter the apartment at the time and that they should contact you to make other arrangements. You should also note to them that your cat is still in the apartment (I would put them in a carrier in the bathroom as others have suggested, just in case). Now, your landlord may be able to make a claim in court that you didn't have a reasonable right to refuse entry (doubtful but possible), but that would be quite some time and effort down the road, as of right now though if they enter despite such a notice being on your door then they are seriously in the wrong.

I invite you to look up what you're talking about. This is exactly what the doctor was talking about. Emergencies, on-call requirements - that was the whole basis of their argument for being allowed to use the HOV as a SOV. Because they might need to be at their job quickly. And I can see your argument for allowing them that privilege in certain circumstances. However, the circumstance here is caused by their own choices to live somewhere where they cannot get to where they need to be in a reasonable amount of time. We're not talking about a situation where occasionally traffic is bad, it is always bad and they knew that going in. That's what makes this situation different, they chose not to take personal responsibility and live somewhere within a reasonable travel distance of their work for a circumstance that constantly comes up (i.e. being on-call is a regular occurrence). It is no different than a Dr at Harborview living in Lynnwood say. If they have to be on-call once or twice a month they could never get there in the 20-30 minutes it takes without traffic during most of the day, so living there is irresponsible for their work requirements and the responsibility for that is on them.",2016-07-16 20:52:01+00:00,d5ex3q5,8.0,t1_d5ewe5s,1274.0,Seattle

However, if there was no check-in or out list then the landlord is shit out of luck, they have no grounds to hold any of your refundable deposit. I don't know about the non-refundable part to be honest, because the law on that is a bit different (and hazier) but if it goes to small claims and you can document these violations a judge might look kindly on you and have it refunded, especially as the law allows for a 2x deposit remittance if the landlord is acting in bad faith.

Prepare for small claims, but once the 21 days are up (not before) email your landlady, send her links to the relevant parts of the RCW for all the violations you can document (don't send her proof - that's for the court) and ask for your full deposit back or you may be forced to open a small claims case. Word this carefully, do not threaten, refer to the Tenants Union perhaps for exact advice. When you open a small claim - if it comes to that - you landlady may contact you and offer to just return your deposit, at this point its worth asking for the whole thing back, both parts. It might work out, again word this carefully do not threaten or appear to extort, it is a negotiation at this point - like a plea deal - then its up to you if you want to go to court or settle.

The fact that we don't know when shouldn't be a reason not to do it, but the opposite! Clearly if the state mandates retrofitting it can choose to superseded historic designation. Besides the fact retrofits are done to keep the historic facades in place, so you don't have to just knock the building down.

And how would you mandate it? Simple you put in place habitation requirements, you can't rent out apartments in un-retrofitted buildings, you can't apply for any type of government permit for a build that is not retrofitted, increase property taxes on buildings that remain un-retrofitted after a certain period. While at the same time putting in place assistance programs to help off-set the costs for business and homeowners. This is a costly endavour and you know what, it might end up costing you a few cents more a year in taxes. But when you consider the human cost of doing nothing (a cost that only increases with time), it's damn worth it.

It was nice of you to ignore the following sentence in my comment, and well the context of the whole thing really. I wasn't saying lower courts would treat it differently just because it was not heard, I was saying it might still end up there again. If you take something to court it can still be appealed all the way up to the top even if you lose every time. Just because something is the law, as defined by a SCOTUS decision, doesn't mean you can't challenge it later. The mood of the country changes and while in years to come lower courts would rule against you - as the precedent is set - SOCTUS might still take it up and make a new decision.",2016-05-03 01:37:13+00:00,d2qgvdf,8.0,t1_d2qgamu,782.0,Seattle

Their first HQ was in Kirkland after they moved out of Seattle and really blew up so I think it's mainly that the Kirkland store was always like the most visited by Execs and so it's supposed to be a shining example of how things are done, sometimes that's all a flagship store is in reality.

People will adjust their plans, work from home, make longer / circuitous commutes, take inconvenient transit options in the short term because it makes their life easier than sitting in worse traffic downtown or on I5. That doesn't at all mean the road is un-needed. It just means people are willing to adjust in the face of a well-planned, well-warned of shut down. In the long term it would be a total clusterfuck as only a relatively small percentage (maybe as high as 30%) of regular commuters have good alternate options in public transit, car pools etc. It's just way too simple a conclusion.

522,"Realistically, how do we solve it? It's all fine and good saying use this ramp for 520 and this ramp for NB I5 but unless you physically divide the freeway to stop people on the west ramps moving across to the 520 exits (for example) people are still going to do it, especially once they work out that signage has no enforcement. You could use camera enforcement, since WSDOT already has ALPR systems in place to measure traffic flow you can probably expand and modify the system to track cars which don't follow the signage rules (I would recommend maybe a 3 strikes system before fines are implemented though), but generally Americans hate camera enforcement of almost anything, so it would likely be very unpopular.

In addition the U District might not be able to cope with the levels of traffic if you force people to avoid the 45th ramp when getting on 520, especially with new transit changes and lightrail in Montlake already increasing traffic down there.

I'm also struggling to understand why the routes which take 2 miles to cross lanes are in this article. 2 miles is more than enough time for you to safely move across 4 lanes of traffic without significantly impacting those around you and causing a slow down, although even as I write this I realize it relies on the idea of other drivers not being a dick and letting you merge, which in my experience going through downtown Seattle is not something that happens as often as it should.",2016-04-13 05:31:19+00:00,d20tzb2,2.0,t1_d20qbf3,7584.0,Seattle

If there's a gas explosion in the line, it will run up into your property until the cap point, which is close enough that it may as well be inside your property.

The only person who has bought homophobia into this discussion is you.

My interpretation of the law is the law. You do not HAVE to be warned of a violation before being arrested (as you have already broken the law), but that IS the practice, besides which a sign that's not clearly visible from outside of the property does not constitute a sufficient notification to the public of the conditions of entry.

As far as preemption goes you are talking about a public entity trying to restrict the possession of firearms on public land. Which yes, is a violation. However this does not have anything to do with private property. State law here is the same anyway (the Seattle statue on trespass is just a mirror of the RCW statue), it is in fact the same in most states as well, just Google it man, I found countless gun club forums that point this out specifically. Private individuals and businesses are free to restrict firearms on their property to their hearts content.

Additionally

&gt; Individuals who receive notice of the conditions of entry, either by a sign [...] and then subsequently violate those conditions of entry may be arrested for criminal trespass.

Let's revisit what Bertha tweeted, namely: ""repairs have since been made""

Let's revisit the definition of the word 'Since', namely: ""in the intervening period between (the time mentioned) and the time under consideration, typically the present.""

Now given that the first tweet was in December 2013, we can take this to be 'the time mentioned' in the above definition, and we can also take the reply from Bertha to the reply from psilotum as being 'the present'.

If you want to do it, I'd say take I-80/84, that's the furthest north I'd risk - even then it's still going to be tough - although we are supposedly in for a milder winter so you may luck out. The ""safest"" way is I-76/70/44 via Indy to OKC, then blast out west on I-40 to LA and up I-5. But even then the stretches of I-40 through New Mexico can be particularly bad in the winter and the CA/OR boarder area is also dicey sometimes and it's a much longer route.

Overall it's a pretty bad idea, take a plane if you can.

I say this as someone who learned to drive in a country with higher speed limits (usually unenforced unless you doing over 85) and smaller, windier highways and a far better car safety record.

The speed limits are often not set for a reason, they are almost entirely arbitrary outside of city streets in fact. But everyone is so shit scared of traffic safety groups they won't do the sensible thing and raise the speed limit (see Gov. Inslee). I'm not saying we should just let everyone go at it, but there is a balance of speed and safety and U.S. highways tend to be way too far on the safety side.",2015-10-16 07:10:17+00:00,cw1md8p,3.0,t1_cw1likj,2932.0,Seattle

The huge land mass between us and the tsunami's origin point, together with the island topography of the Sound mean that any wave front that does make it into this part of the Sound will be severely dissipated, likely only very low lying areas would see any effect at all. The quake might cause smaller local wave fronts within the Sound though that could be deadly and damaging. Those will be the primary worry but current sea defenses would probably do a good job oh mitigating some of the damage from them as well.",2015-07-14 18:20:53+00:00,ct372w0,9.0,t1_ct35dfg,2364.0,Seattle

941,"This is the worst of all possible worst-case scenarios, and not really very likely. The port would be heavily damaged by a quake, but could very quickly be rebuilt since the tsunami would have relatively little impact on the Elliot Bay area, the port's largest vulnerability is that the shore infrastructure sits on a liquefaction zone, but given that any resultant tsunami would completely devastate the Port of Tacoma it would a top priority to get it operational - there is just no other choice. I would imagine you'd be looking at it being operational at some capacity in days, and becoming the center of local relief efforts. As for the tech companies. They stay, of course they stay, there is no other choice. They can redistribute operations to other locals in the short term as needed, but the sheer investment in the area companies like Microsoft have make it almost impossible to leave. Plus Redmond is positioned well to survive a quake and once the infrastructure begins to rebuild operations can resume. Seattle based companies are going to be hit much harder. Amazon might leave, it's a possibility, although most of their buildings are constructed to the right code so other than infrastructure issues they might not suffer as hard as others. Companies are insured against these things so they can weather such storms, abandoning the PNW just isn't an option, especially in the I-5 corridor.

But the biggest reason why I think this is way too pessimistic is the Navy. They can't afford to abandon the Sound and the DoD will pile everything they can into getting those bases back online, which will involved getting the local infrastructure back online. The military-industrial complex might but be the saving grace for the PNW in this scenario.",2015-07-13 20:19:30+00:00,ct23lmw,7.0,t1_ct21mtf,2872.0,Seattle
