6,Nothing that i know of would be interfering with it is my guess. Also if i reset the router or change the dhcp time frame and apply settings the time changes on when it turns off. For example it turns off every hour on the :23 minute right now. If i reset or reboot the router/modem the time it turns off will change and ill have to watch the full hour to see when my wifi icon goes off of my devices and then turns back on.,2016-11-16 20:39:45+00:00,da38h6s,2,t1_da2o2t1,26801,HomeNetworking

If I would log out of my FB on the app and re log back into my FB through the app what would happen? Would it just do nothing and keep all what I currently have?

Third question how come unlinking your FB then deleting the app then downloading the app and re logging into FB would not just load your data like al other apps do? There's so many apps i delete or log out of FB on re download and it saves all my exp levels and data.

Fourth question what is the full proper way of migration from one device to another

Fifth question what is the wrong ways to migrate or unlink FB that cause your account to be lost forever. Reason i would like to know this is for the future if i get a new phone to know what not to do.
