My problem consists of my wifi turning off then back on every hour on the exact same minute on all of my connected devices iphone, ipads, tablets ect. 

Ive went into my router settings and changed my dhcp lease which was default as 3600 seconds, which is 1 hour. I thought oh great my problem is fixed i changed it to 86400 which would renew it every 24 hours instead. But even with this setting set its still sadly turning off then back on every single hour. 

I had a technician come out and replace the router/modem thinking maybe it was defective but to no prevail its still happening.  Im not sure what else it could possibly be or what i can do to fix this issue. Its very annoying as when im watching streams or web searching it will turn off and cut me right off the internet for 10-30 seconds every hour until it automatically turns back on. 

I've already did all the basic things like factory reset the router/modem and unplug and replug it all back up. I also tried going into my clients on my router and reserving ips on my iphone and ipad to see if that fixes it but still has not.

My router/modem is a model TG1682G arris and is a default from the ISP provider. I have no other routers or anything else connected other than the one they gave me.

If anyone has had this issue or is a wifi wizard please help me out to fixing this problem. Thank you in advance ",HomeNetworking,Wifi turning off every hour at the same time,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/5d8iah/wifi_turning_off_every_hour_at_the_same_time/

So basically how it would work would be the same as when you go into your avatar outfits and you are able to save multiple outfits and swap through them with a hit of a button. 

You would go into each keyblade and move medals into each slot you wanted and then save that setup and hit the button to swap to a new setup.

This would be very useful as people have different sets for different occasions like coliseum for example you may use different medals with skills and healers and overall different medals then lets say you would use to attack high level raid bosses or another example would be if you have a certain setup for farming lux on levels, you know those 5* wakkas :). 

So all in all its just a cool idea I haven't seen anyone talk about that i know of and would be very useful i feel because switching medals is definitely time consuming and looking for certain ones and remembering which slots you had them all in for maximum damage. So come on all lets get SE to implement this in the game what do all you keyblade wielders say!!",KingdomHearts,[KHUX] IDEA Keyblade multiple saved sets,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/4mhm0i/khux_idea_keyblade_multiple_saved_sets/

So hears how I basically see it, you have a phone with khux linked to FB then if you want to transfer to a new phone you would

1: download the app on the new phone
2: when you go in the app hit migrate data and basically it would transfer everything over from the old phone to the new
3: i guess your done now?

Questions though what would happen if i unlinked my FB on my current phone then deleted the app then re downloaded the app on my current phone again and logged back into FB? Would it just load my data? 

Im trying to mostly know what NOT to do that would cause your data to be gone so i never do it. Im guessing you would first unlink FB delete the app then start a new game? But also if you started a new game couldn't you just login to FB and it would overwrite whatever game you had with your FB game? Please help and correct me if im wrong hopefully someone understands this post and can help :).",KingdomHearts,[KHUX] FB migration and linking question,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/4jwilz/khux_fb_migration_and_linking_question/

So say for example i have a wakka fully guilted with a 18% guilt bonus and for example i pull another wakka with lets say poison as a skill bonus and i want to keep that bonus and re roll the guilt bonus. So i level the new wakka up to 6* and instead of fusing the old wakka to the new to get the 20% overwrite skill chance i fuse the new wakka with poison and 0 bubbles filled with the old wakka with all bubbles filled and 18% guilt bonus will all the bubbles fill on the wakka with poison and i will keep the skill with 100% chance correct? Or will i lose bubbles for fusing a fully bubbled wakka with one without any? Thanks hope my explanation wasn't too confusing.,KingdomHearts,Question about guilt,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/4gy5l2/question_about_guilt/

The stat is always higher than the actual medal itself for example my power riku STR is 6624 + 790 from the chip strength medals making it 7414 on my screen but on the friends share list it shows as 9311 STR whats making each medal higher? ,KingdomHearts,STR stat for shared medals,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/4fg9xd/str_stat_for_shared_medals/
