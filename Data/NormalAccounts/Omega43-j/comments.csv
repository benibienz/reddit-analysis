31,"Packers for this one reason: 
History. 

No team has the same level of history than us. We have a literal team of hall of famers and future hall of famers. 

No other team can boast three FHof and CHof QBs: Bart Starr (Was apart of the Packers team who won the first two Super Bowls) 

Brett Favre (it's Brett Favre cmon...) 

Aaron Rodgers (has the best arm in nfl history [possibly second to Dan Marino]) FHof 

Skill positions? Man we gotchu! 

Paul Hornung, Jim Taylor, Don Hutson ect. The list goes on! 

Offensive lineman? Wow ok, Jerry Kramer? Forrest Gregg?? I mean sheesh we are stacked! 

Defensive lineman? Man...let me tell you about the late and great Reggie White! The Minister of Defense himself! ( he played with the Eagles to start his NFL career but we don't mention that) 
Vonnie Holiday? Gilbert ""Gravedigger"" Brown? 

We have the second most HoF of any team! (Second to the Bears, but once again we don't mention that!) 

I mean the great, historical ""What the HELLS going on out there?!"" Vince Lombardi! The freaking SUPERBOWL trophy is named after him because of how impeccable he ran the famous POWER SWEEP!!! 

In all seriousness though the Packers are the most historical team along with the Giants and Bears. 

The Packers are the most historically stacked team when you break it down, position by position.  

All in all, the Packers are the way to go. No if ands or butts about it my man. I hope to see you wearing a cheesehead on Sunday's and catching up on our amazing history.

40,"The Browns and Redskins have not a franchise QB in the last what 50 years when the Browns had Otto Graham and the Redskins had what Sunny Jergenson? (Is that his name?) or even Sammy Baugh if you want to go back further if my memory serves correct. 

Look at the top QBs in the league today drafted in the top ten. The math is there that they have a much higher chance of succeeding. Having said that my two teams the Packers and Rams, haven't drafted a QB in the top ten in years. (Jared Goff exception ) 

The packers completely lucked out with Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers. 

The Rams had Trent green who then got hurt then Kurt Warner comes in for a few years. Who have they had since who has been consistently good? No one. It wasn't until this year they draft a strong arm QB number one. Sam Bradford was just a dumb move from the beginning. He had shoulder surgery and has a below average arm that is just accurate and is best suited for a west coast style offense that the Rams don't run. 

TL;DR draft a QB higher and you're safer. Don't wait for a miracle. ",2016-08-11 01:12:48+00:00,d6cn1bw,7,t1_d6cmh2v,877,nfl

The plane has a handle and when you pull it, it ""shoots"" a charge about the size of a .22 round. The round ignites the priming circuit setting off the c4. The c4 literally cuts a big square in the skeleton of the plane and releases a life raft. Used for when the plane crashes in the ocean. 
You have to replace these circuits, primers, and explosives every so often.
