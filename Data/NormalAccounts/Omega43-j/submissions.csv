Long unto me I have agreed in my head, that it should be full of lead. 

I pulled the trigger and now I'm dead, such a pity. I fear my family will dread. 

Of love once lost. An ultimate cost. Such as bitter  as the the winters frost. 

I have been tossed to and fro in the belly of the beast but this at least, has kept me on a tight leash. 

I've been let loose from the noose that had kept me hanging around and I am spell bound by the sight I behold before me. 

I see the devils glare that has kept me ensnared and brother death himself has been well prepared. 

He sharpens his scythe and grits at his might, but oh such a blight they are together. 

They bring me in and hold me close as deaths cold embrace overtakes me. 

Night and day I sway in my head as this thought rattles around. How is it now that the sun pierces through and seamlessly bounds before me? 

When just a day ago it was all black here below and no hope gleemlessly  shown before. 

And now as the night gives way to day, the sun peeks at me from heaven above. It baths me in its unearthly glow but alas it is cold here so lo'. 

I reach up high as I'm dragged down deeper into that black abysmal abyss. I reach and claw and appalled at what I saw, your very face beside me. 

I hold you close, I kiss your cheek, but all of this in meek. You turn, you bash, you seem rather crash, as I am dragged deeper on down still. 

I fall to my knees and beg pretty please bring a blanket for me lo'. 

I shiver, I whimper, I ball up tight. But alas it is cold down here so lo'. 

All alone now with a head full of lead, and a nary a blanket aldershotit. I spread my arms and legs, and much to my dread I find o' puddle of blood beside me. 

To my chagrin I take a sip, and see it be my own indeed. Yay I bleed in this hole below and not a man in sight. 

I look in the mirror and oh such clearer I see the man I was before. 

I use to grin and smile and laugh and banter and carry on my long lost way. The road was narrow and I the pharaoh fell of the road on down. 

Down I tumble in life's little staircase with bumps and bruises to show. I hop right back up and with o' bit of pluck I keep on trekkin forward. 

But nay, nay, nay, I panter at my dismay. I look around and see no bound as I'm the only man here. 

All alone within a place so drech and bleak. I curl up once more and finally take on that eternal sleep, that is so much bittersweet.

It's about six o'clock in the afternoon and the afternoon rush comes in. A very attractive woman comes in and I give the standard Line ""Hello, how may I assist you today?""  So I check her in and a few hours pass buy. She comes down to the desk and asks where the pool is and I tell her. 
A little while later I get a call at the front desk ""Good evening front desk?"" 
""YES Hey is ---- there?"" 
""Yes ma'am this is he.""
""*giggles* yeah I was wondering if you could bring some extra towels?""
""Yes ma'am right away."" 
I go and tell my shift supervisor that I'm going to take some towels to the pool. Now going to the pool is a small hallway and in my left is the gym and directly in front of me is the pool. I walk in and I see the lady standing there in a towel and she says"" Oh thank you I was out of dry towels."" 
She then drops her towel and she is completely naked. I drop my towels and run out. 
I immediately run to my shift supervisor and tell him what happened. He said ""dude she is such a sweet lady, no way she did that!"" 
""Check the tape bro!"" 
He pulls up the tape and the camera only shows me entering the pool area and immediately leaving. There wasn't a camera in the pool area. (Indoor saltwater pool) 
He said ""man I don't believe you, go attend the bar, it's rush hour."" 
So I go to the bar and serve drinks. She comes to the counter only wearing a t shirt and a bikini top clearly seen through her wet tshirt. She had no bottoms on and I clearly saw everything by the reflection in the Windows. 
She said"" hey honey how old are you?"" 
I immediately blush and stutter out ""I'm sixteen, ma'am"" 
She visually pouts like a ""humph"" and walks off. 
To this day when I tell this story my supervisor doesn't believe me. I can't believe it even happened.
