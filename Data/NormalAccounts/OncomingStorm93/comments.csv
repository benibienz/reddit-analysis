Gase just coordinated Cutler's best statistical season. In Denver he coordinated Peyton's best statistical season. He QB coached Tim Fucking Tebow to an 8-8 record. He's learned from Nick Saban, John Fox, and several other successful coaches. Considered to be one of the brightest young offensive minds in the game and is praised from all corners of the NFL as such. Has shown ability to adapt his coaching style and schemes to personnel.

I was shocked he didn't get a HC gig last year, and was my #1 HC candidate this cycle.

I'd move the microphone down closer to where you're sitting, it looks weird in the top right corner of the screen, leaving empty space below.

293,"We are entering a new prime area of animated television. Adventure Time, Regular Show, Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, all shows with deeply developed characters, a lack of childish humor, continuity (which for a while networks didn't think kids would be able to follow), and perhaps the best voice acting the industry ha s seen (at least in diversity of talent), and of course increasing quality in animation. Adventure Time was never a show I could get into myself either, but I recognize the appeal.

303,"This past weekend I caught up on the past two seasons of ""Childrens Hospital"". I tuned out of the show eons ago, despite it being one of my favorite comedies at the time. I found these recent seasons to be a bit below the bar however; Season 5 transported the show from Not-Brazil to Not-Japan, and I think the show put too much focus on the new fake setting. Season 6 simply lacked many of the cast members for too many episodes, but there were some standout episodes, particularly ""Fan Fiction"". The show needs to get some of it's mojo back, which might be more difficult now that Rob Corddry is tied up with the horrible ""Ballers"" on HBO.",2015-07-22 17:16:33+00:00,ctcb7h7,1,t3_3e7dpg,8058,television

I'd recommend watching the entire season, since every episode is funny and subverts science fiction tropes, but if you want the essentials, I'd recommend 1-5 to meet all the characters and introduce plot points, and 9, 16, 19 and 20 for the main plot. The funniest other episodes are 7, 10 and 13, although really you should watch the entire first season.",2015-07-12 19:47:24+00:00,ct0xu7j,2,t1_ct0xl1b,478,television
