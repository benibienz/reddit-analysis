At first glance it sounds like an ok idea, moving people out to the regions of the country where we actually need investment.

Its dark outside in the mornings. Turn on your fucking lights. Stop fucking around on your phone. Dont be the cunt horse I saw last week watching the fucking rugby on the mobile on your dashboard when you're going at 80 mph down the motorway. Fucking INDICATE. See those white lines on the road? If you dont cross those, or weave across them like a sailor home for the first time in six months, we are all safer. If those white lines arent actually there, its still a good idea to stay on the left hand side of the road as you go around blind corners in the countryside. I dont know why I have to fucking explain this, but apparently I do.

Deer, you're fucking idiots too. Are my headlights fucking magnetic or something? Dont just spring from one side of the road to the other, you nearly made me shit myself. Twice.

Not much of a network at all. Other half's family have farmers, vets, clerical workers and a teacher or two. Is the network the vital thing I'm missing? I've heard it as the largest obstacle to non Norwegians finding work.

Same guy also refused to believe that a meteor killed off the dinosaurs because ""where did all the mass go?"", ignoring the Titanic energies involved that would turn the bloody thing to dust. "" dust has no mass!"" Then ignored the example of taking a kilo bag of flour and throwing it on the floor covering everything in flour dust.

There's an overused idiom on reddit that you can't reason someone out of a position that they didn't reason themselves into, but there needs to be an additional caveat for people who manage to reason themselves into a position by lack of understanding of what is actually going on.

109,"So?

Water is a fucking great working fluid. You can stack it fucking full of energy, expand it quite nicely (not entirely perfectly but pretty decently) in a turbine and get a good chunk of that energy out as usable motion.

In marine propulsion terms, steam turbines have classically been the most economical source of power for large tonnage ships until relatively recently. The Jahre Viking/Seawise Giant, one of the largest man-made things on the planet was powered by these, as was pretty much every large ship before the proliferation of large diesel engines.

A large part of this is that the fuel for ships is generally shitty quality. Its thick, viscous, and burns like shit. Its a lot easier to make it burn in a furnace than it is trying to burn it in a large diesel engine or refine it to a grade suitable for use in gas turbines; and ship owners are generally all about minimising costs - and this goes double for the soviet navy in the era that this ship was built. 

Criticising the soviet navy for using steam on the basis of being a ""17th century technology"" is pretty bloody stupid. Do you bitch about electricity? Thats a ""17th century technology"" too. ",2016-10-21 19:07:39+00:00,d9252yn,3,t1_d9242sd,1259,unitedkingdom

184,"I don't know what you studied at university but you plainly didn't learn much about the history of Plymouth during the war and its rebuilding after it. 

Most of the city center got utterly wiped out by the blitz and indeed I'm wondering exactly how much notice you took of the city out your window given how much the local council pins on it. 

Even then, it should be pretty apparent to anyone with a bit of nous given the amount of decidedly modern buildings in a city generally dating from the 1400s that the war left a deep scar on the city.

&gt;Lol that you got downvoted. Lived there for 4 years at uni. The city center really is ugly, after the war they demolished what was left of the (Probably) lovely old Street plan and built huge wide pedestrianised shopping streets. 

&gt;Unfortunately everything they built was low quality, much either pebble dashed or made from that yellowish stone that greys very quickly. 

Don't know where you're getting the pebble dashed thing from, maybe the civic center? Most of the civic buildings are done in local limestone or granite, and a lot of it is yellowed from many decades of exposure to air pollution. As for low quality, its pretty frustrating that nobody seems to learn any bloody history these days and doesn't know that post war austerity continued for quite some time, most historians have the ending as 1950 or so. Post war expansion in the sixties and seventies does leave a lot of iffy housing stock, but that's not exclusively a Plymouth problem.

&gt;Even worse is the fact that the wide straight streets are boring, sprawling and windy. Add in the building of drake circus shopping center on the east side and a recession meant that almost everything west of amada way worth visiting shut.

Plymouths economy is probably described as fragile at the best of times. 2008 hit it pretty hard and there's nothing I can see the council doing to improve matters spectacularly. Yes, its windy. That's partly the architecture and partly the climate.

The main guy and architectural vision you want to look up is Sir Patrick Abercrombie and his Plan for Plymouth. Plymouth looks pretty much as he intended and its visually very stunning if you like that clean kind of modernist, art-deco esque architecture from the 30s. A few years ago the council pressure washed the city center and turned it from the run down looking beige to the brilliant sparkling white of abercrombies plan and it looked loads better.

&gt;I still have a very special place in my heart for Plymouth and love the hoe and barbican, and the surrounding countryside. But a pretty city it is not.

Given the battering its taken from the war, industrial decline, recessions and successive local council doing their level best to cripple the city, its in grand shape.

251,"Eh?

A fundamentalist jewish school was in the news pretty recently for isolating their pupils so much from the english language that they nearly killed a bunch on a school trip.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/pupils-at-illegal-faith-school-almost-died-after-being-taken-on-hike-up-a-cliff-in-traditional-ultra-a7116956.html

&gt;A group of ultra-Orthodox Jewish students nearly drowned after being taken on a hiking expedition by unqualified teachers working at an illegal faith school that the Government has known about for five years but which remains open.

&gt;The children, who were dressed in traditional Orthodox clothes instead of hiking gear for the trip on 6 June and were unable to read warning signs because they can't speak any English, had to be rescued by emergency services after the tide came and nearly swept them out to sea.

&gt;The Independent understands that the teachers put the children’s lives in further danger because, once they realised they were at risk of drowning, they initially contacted community leaders in Stamford Hill, north London, instead of contacting authorities for fear of the illegal school being discovered.

By all means let faiths have their own schools, but rigorous, repeated and random inspections must be used to keep a lid on the kind of bullshit in the video and in this news article.",2016-08-29 15:49:51+00:00,d71bf9o,3,t1_d71a73n,1693,unitedkingdom

261,"It depends on your subject, but as a kneejerk reaction to most courses that I can think of: No, not really.

Short of a course in digital artwork or music, theres nothing that an Ipad gives you an advantage over having a PC. Typing a report on an Ipad or doing the most elementary Excel kind of analysis sounds like hell, you'll find it a lot easier on a PC with a keyboard and mouse.

What subject are you studying?

Seriously, sit down right now and figure out how much money you'll need per month for your actual bills (rent, food, travel costs, other bills (electricity/gas/water/phone/internet)) and multiply that by the number of months you'll be away from home. Subtract that number from the amount you're getting.

That is the money you can actually do stuff with. Divide this number by the number of months you have. This amount is your monthly budget for stuff that isnt meant to keep you ticking over as a functioning student - nights out, electric gizmos, other bullshit.

BTW, I understand the allure of suddenly getting a lot of money when you've never had that much before, but you do not need a £300 graphics card to have a good experience. You should visit /r/buildapc to get some feedback on building one yourself. Components are all modular and its essentially like building an electric lego kit.

EDIT:

I get the max £7000 loan for living at home, and need to spend the money. I have £2000 travel costs.

You dont *NEED* to spend jack. This is both the cheapest money and most expensive money you'll ever get your hands on. Cheap because its apparently just dropped straight into your hands without you ever having had to work for it, expensive because later you have to pay it back and the amount with magnify with compounding interest. 

You should not be focussing on blowing as much cash as you can, you should be figuring out how to keep as much of it as possible or making it work for you through saving or investment.",2016-08-27 19:47:40+00:00,d6z4rql,3,t1_d6z4330,1118,AskUK
262,"Pretty gobsmacked that you already decided to rush out and spend a big chunk of cash without knowing what an overdraft is. 

But anyway:

1) Yes, this means that you can essentially borrow £1500 from your bank with no interest until such time as they decide that your student account is no longer a student account and reverts to a normal current account.

Dont be a fucking idiot and spend it all at once, you'll most likely need 60-100% of it dealing with actual pressing costs like rent, bills or food. 

2) Exact circumstances are everything for this. At the very least, do you have a receipt?

3,4) Apparently legit, but dont bother going the amazon/alienware route, AW is massively overpriced and you'll be far better off building your own machine. I know Novatech has an agreement with another credit company so that you can put off the payments for six months or so, but always check the T&amp;C's.

In general, this post shrieks to me that you have generally thought about how much cash you're getting but not how to budget or take account of your finances.

Spitfire has undercarriage mounted centrally closing towards the wings. Hurricane has undercarriage mounted mid-wing closing towards the center.

Spitfire has a radiator under one or both wings. Hurricane has its radiator centrally located on the belly.

Spitfire has eliptical planform wings, with no straight edges (unless some clever dick goes ""hurr, clipped wings!""). Hurricane's got straight-edged tapered wings.

Armament of the time around the battle of britain was 8x .303 machine guns. Hurricane has these mounted in one grouped battery of four in each wing (oooo) while the spitfire had them spaced one - two - one (o   oo   o) because of the wheel well outboard of the fuselage.

Spitfire behind the cockpit is a smooth line towards the tail. Hurricane is noted for its hump-backed appearance.

Spitfire's skin is a semi-monocoque with stressed aluminium construction. Hurricane had construction techniques straddling the twenties and thirties - aluminium where it mattered, but fabric covering a tubular frame in other areas. If you look on the fuselage behind the cockpit on the hurricane, its looks like its got long longitudinal creases - its actually just the fabric covering stretching over frame members.

They had some annoying pay by phone thing but I had that with a council car park back home so think nothing more about it and go to the pub.

I come back only 2 hours later (toddler daughter to put in bed by 7) and the entire car park is locked up with rolling steel shutters. No access on foot, can't just walk up the ramps. There's nobody I can call, all the numbers displayed are either cut off or just take you to the intensely annoying payment robot.

Its at this point I think I have to say there are no signs anywhere stating opening times for this place, but several for the payment service.

Turns out this place is infamous locally as being run by crooks, charging drivers a fixed pcn and being hellish to appeal. The local government have also known about this for at least two years but are powerless to do anything because its private land.

I know theres been some work with adding ethanol to diesel to make it ""green"" (man, I cant type that without breaking into a smile) but I thought it was limited to a max of somewhere between 10-15% by mass, not pure ethanol by itself. Interesting stuff you're doing there!

&gt;Could you suggest me what should I do for Spacing, I dont get about ""4 CAD spacing"".

CAD = Crank Angle Degrees. You space your results out across the cycle range from 0 CAD to 360 CAD. If you have 4 degree spacing, you have 90 sample points through the cycle. If you have 2 degree spacing, you get 180 sample points through the cycle. You simply get a better idea of exactly whats going on with the increase in number of sample points, but of course it takes longer to calculate.

You might be able to get away with 4 CAD spacing since you're running at a fairly low RPM - mine normally run quite a bit faster so my sample spacing is a lot lower to capture behaviour.

If you havent got it already, I'd highly recommend ""Introduction to Internal Combustion Engines"" by Richard Stone.

I'd also recommend not plotting contours of velocity, but vector arrows of velocity so you can get some idea of tumble and squish.",2016-07-22 19:29:54+00:00,d5mr3in,5,t1_d5moqmn,2977,CFD

319,"Well, yeah, but theres more to it than just that.

I dont need to worry about the difference between an idealised model and the actual geometry itself - we simulate our exact combustion chamber as it is going to be. No simplifications, no sectors, as close to wysiwyg as possible.

I dont need to worry about meshing in anything like the same level as I remember the ansys workbench meshing tool being a kick in the bollocks to use. Setting up AMR or embedded meshes around spray cones or adding block mesh refinement is really a pretty easy process.

For this video in particular being kind of stuttery even though theres a fairly uniform 4 CAD spacing - it seems odd, to me. Converge isnt great in this regard either, if you're using paraview to post process especially if you're posting in batch. Lots of dropped frames which are totally blank, or you can have some frames that have everything you want with others having only the company logo and title block. That said, I would have hoped that Ansys' post (is it still CFD-post?) could at least make an animation that wasnt stuttering.

As a note to OP: You probably want to take information from at least the third complete cycle after you start. The jump at 1:26 to your apparent initial state is really jarring.

Dont get me wrong, here, what you've done here is great and I would shudder to try doing it in ansys.

This difference in viewpoints is why parliamentary Labour have the knives out for him - his view isnt in tune with theirs.

Put frankly, a lot of people are now in extreme fear for their jobs as companies work out how to restructure their operations in the face of this vote.

A lot of companies came to the UK because of access to the EU. If we're now leaving in two years, why bother to invest or expand? Is it better for them to move operations abroad, or simply never set up here in the UK in the first place?

3) THe Prime MInister resigned, ffs. Political leadership is in question.

515,"Done a bit of digging around and the problem seems fairly obvious.

A lot of sources state problems with the intercooler between the low pressure and high pressure compressor. You want to compress air to get as much oxygen as you can into the combustor to burn more fuel.

But compressing air needs a transfer of work energy and this manifests as heat in the air you just compressed, reducing its density - so the amount of oxygen you get is less than what it should be. 

To get around this problem, you raise the density again by cooling the air between compression stages and this is problem. The type 45 apparently uses seawater as a heat sink to dump the heat generated by compressing the air.

Lets say that we have a flow rate of 25 kg/s of water. Water temperature in the gulf of arabia is something like 30 degrees. Water temperature in the english channel is something like 12. Specific heat capacity of water is something like 4.2kj/kg.

So by operating in the Gulf instead of the Channel, they can get rid of about 1.9MW less of heat energy before entering the combustors, so the efficiency and power output drops.

This isnt the be-all or end of it, though, theres lots of things that can be adjusted to compensate or can suffer equally in turn.

That said, the mention of problems arising after only sustained operation leads me to believe they've got problems with salt crystallisation in solution. In low temp waters this isnt an issue if you design everything right, but in higher temps its something you need to account for. Salt crystallising inside passages basically means once its taken hold, youre fucked. You cant flush it out easily and its presence there means that any heat transfer efficiency you had is totally destroyed. The only way you can really get rid of it is to replace the component affected which obviously on gas turbines means £££££££.

516,"The engines powering the Royal Navy’s cutting-edge fleet of Type 45 destroyers are unable to operate continuously in the warm waters of the Gulf, MPs were told on Tuesday.
Executives from BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Northrop Grumman and General Electric were grilled by the defence select committee about the failures that have caused the UK’s newest and most advanced destroyers to break down repeatedly in recent years, leaving them without power for propulsion or weapons systems.

Responding to questions about why the power systems failed in warmer waters than the UK, John Hudson, managing director of BAE Systems maritime, said the original specifications for the vessel had not required it to sustain extremes. “The operating profile at the time was that there would not be repeated or continuous operations in the Gulf,” he said.

Tomas Leahy, of Rolls-Royce naval programmes, said the destroyer was now operating in “far more arduous conditions than envisaged in the specifications”.

However, the Ministry of Defence denied that this was the case. “The Type 45 was designed for worldwide operations from sub-Arctic to extreme tropical environments and continues to operate effectively in the Gulf and South Atlantic all year round.”

The six ships, which cost the taxpayer £1bn each, are the backbone of Britain’s combat force at sea and are among the most advanced missile destroyers in the world. They are the Royal Navy’s first all-electric ships and are driven by two Rolls-Royce WR21 gas turbines and two Wartsila diesel engines.

The WR21 is designed to deliver significantly improved operating costs by using an intercooler recuperator, which recovers exhaust and recycles the gas into the engine.
But, as a rule, power turbines slowed down in warm temperatures, MPs were told. This had not been recognised by the system, which continued to demand more power. Eventually the generators would come to a halt. “This is not the fault of the WR21,” said Mr Leahy. “It is the laws of physics.”
MPs could hardly believe what they had heard. “I am absolutely stunned,” said Douglas Chapman, of the Scottish National party. “To have a £1bn asset that you put into a war zone and we don’t know if those people we put there can come out alive — I am just astounded.”
It also emerged that some of the difficulties were rooted in late-stage design changes demanded by the US Navy, when it was leading development of the electric propulsion system. However, the US Navy pulled out of the programme in 2000, when it was taken over by the UK’s MoD. Mr Leahy said that only 1,900 hours of testing had been carried out on the system after the design change, while the problems only emerged after 4,000-5,000 hours of operation.

“With hindsight it would have been good to do another 4,000-5,000 hours of testing on it,” he said.

The MoD is having to set aside tens of millions of pounds to fix the destroyers. The plan is to install two extra diesel engines which will require cutting a hole in the hull of the brand new destroyers.

MPs expressed concerns that the costs of repairing the Type 45 were forcing a delay in the Type 26 frigate programme. Original plans were for the first steel to be cut on the frigates by the end of this year, but this is now not likely before December 2017.

Former First Sea Lord Alan West warned that any delay on the Type 26 programme could threaten the UK’s defensive capability, and lead to a serious erosion of shipbuilding skills, which would prove far more costly to rebuild. The government had already weakened the Royal Navy’s capabilities by cutting the number of frigates that would be ordered from 13 to eight in last year’s strategic defence and security review, he said.

“There is almost no money available this year and we are really strapped next year. The government aren’t coming clean about that,” he said. “We have run out of money effectively and they [MoD] have pushed this programme to the right and that is bloody dangerous.”",2016-06-08 09:49:17+00:00,d40od1y,1,t3_4n42qx,3550,unitedkingdom

The one caveat to this is the system you've got getting ale out of the kegs. If you've got a system like this seems to be, there should be a good seal and the water shouldnt get into the beer. Looks like its different from the last real ale pub I worked in, which had long lance like tubes to get near the bottom of the barrel with a rubber tapered plug around one end.

540,"I'm sorry to tell you this but I think you should consider a different idea.

I signed up to a couple of websites supposedly for putting people in touch with tutors. According to their criteria I wasn't good enough to even be seen in public search results. I needed to travel into london to their offices to confirm my identity with my passport because I wasnt about to scan my passport and send it via email.

Once I did this, I appeared briefly in the public search results - but on something like the tenth page so I didnt get any views or booking requests, despite being a lot cheaper than the tutors at the head of the results. On top of this, the website wanted to cream off 10% of any payment which would go through their hands first and also managed to fuck up the most elementary of PM forms. There were some attractive features like being able to specify the time slots you had available but this feature didnt work so it was useless. 

At this point I threw my hands up, said ""fuck it!"" and decided to do it all myself.

I started posting adverts on Gumtree and knocked together a quick website with the barest (I think I set myself a target of five lines per page?) of copy about subjects and about me, and my phone/email essentially never stopped buzzing from September '14 to May '15.  Quite a few of those emails were from agencies trying to get me on their books, but trying to get me to agree to give up something like 40% of my rate per hour.

In short, I got on far better by myself, with an absolute minimum of bullshit than if I had used such a site. 

Now of course, this is colored by the sites that are already out there being terrible - I'd suggest you have a look for yourself at whats out there and try and strip it back to the bare minimum in much the same way as Gumtree is.

http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/26/woman-offered-safe-haven-to-troubled-girls-then-pimped-them-out

&gt;MacGregor was convicted of four offences against two victims, including forcing a girl into prostitution, false imprisonment and conspiracy to rape. 

&gt;KinKids (MacGregor's charity) purported to be a support group offering financial, legal and emotional support, face-to-face and via a 24-hour helpline, to carers, like MacGregor herself, who were providing full-time care for the children of relatives or friends who – because of illness, death or prison – were unable to fulfil parental obligations.

&gt;MacGregor was an energetic, high-profile campaigner on behalf of abused children, even speaking out at two meetings with local voluntary groups in early 2015 attended by members of the government-appointed team sent in to run Rotherham council in the wake of the scandal, including the lead commissioner, Sir Derek Myers.

&gt;“She appeared quite passionate [at the meetings], saying she was working with vulnerable children and families and that they [KinKids] were providing support to people across child sexual abuse issues,” said Shafiq Hussain, of Voluntary Action Rotherham.

&gt;The grooming trial, however, heard that MacGregor offered her home to vulnerable young girls then pimped them out so they could earn their keep.

In short, she lured abused kids into her home under the guise of being a safe haven, and then fed them straight back to their abusers. In the meantime, she acted as a double agent with local childrens services playing the role of a solution to the very problem she herself was helping to cause.

Shelley Davies was convicted of conspiracy to procure prostitutes and false imprisonment, essentially acting as an aide to MacGregor.",2016-05-30 16:14:37+00:00,d3p9mfm,13,t1_d3p95ks,764,ukpolitics

556,"&gt;This is one of those situations where the reality is quite a bit more complicated than simply ""Muslims are raping little white girls."" For starters most of the reports were looking at ethnicity, not religion. In the Rotherham stuff (which we've assumed is what he's talking about) the perpetrators were targeting everyone - boys, girls, of all ethnicities and so on. And it was more criminal gang-related than religion-related.

&gt;Of course, the host probably should have tried to discuss it, rather than just denying it and cutting the guy off. 

Like with a lot of things, its easier said than done. Hell, the two reports that *must* be read from end to end on this, the Jay Report and its later followup, the Casey Report, are both mammoth pieces of rather depressing reading. Fat chance of either:

a) halting a conversation, telling people to go and read them then come back. You sound like a conceited (if technically accurate) arsehole and you risk alienating people because its a fucking massive amount of text to read and absorb in one sitting.

b) putting across a coherent summary in the space of thirty seconds that either covers all the bases and doesnt get interrupted.

c) getting people to read it. To date, I've not encountered another user on this website that has convinced me that they have read both of them from end to end - despite the reports being publicly available and despite them having been published getting on for 2 years and 18-ish?- months ago, now.

593,"&gt;So we’re left with nearly 20,000 hectares of accessible green belt in and around London. That doesn’t mean all the sites on this map should be developed. Some are well-used local parks with valuable public access, some have high-profile existing uses (Epsom Downs racecourse for instance), some will have other constraints. 

&gt;Update, 17/06/14. Thanks to @geographyjim for prompting me to calculate how much of this accessible green belt is within the Greater London boundary. The answer is around 2,850 hectares. 

So straight away (the update is the same day as the original post) the amount of land acreage drops to **one seventh** of the original figure because its not under the GLA jurisdiction. But the telegraph quotes the original figure anyway. Hmmmmmmm.

Since its explicitly mentioned, Epsom Downs racecourse is about 600 acres. So if you continue and exclude that one alone, you're then looking at getting on for one ninth of the original figure.

The UK has some of the highest power costs in the EU. A lot of aluminium refining goes on in scandinavia for example because they've got a fuckton of relatively cheap and green hydroelectricity.

Theres also other emissions issues and high labour costs. A running theme in a lot of british engineering industry is under investment in technology. Other countries have continually upgraded their machinery and equipment while we might not have (as appears to be the case in the UK steel industry), thus they've got better profit margins.

Finally, the majority of things that are made of steel dont need really, really exotic stuff. Its a relatively small subset (that generally correlates to what remains of high tech engineering -  automotive, aerospace and defence) that need these alloys. 

For the really niche stuff like single crystal turbine blades, I think I'm right in saying that Rolls have their own small smelt house that receive ingots of high quality alloy and do their own magic to ensure its a single crystal. 

Generally, the industry has become specialised but has major drawbacks that make other makers more competitive on price.

Sure, on aggregate - but not on a local level. 

&gt;We can buy steel from other countries.

No we fucking cant. 

Cheap bullshit steel, sure, we can get that from elsewhere. We cant get good steel from developing countries because the quality control is lacking.

Redditors seem to have this idea that making steel is like making a cake where you just chuck a bunch of stuff in a crucible, stir it around and then pour it out - it is *much* more complicated than that.

Quench temp/duration, anneal temp/duration, atmospheric control, composition correction, microstructure phase and loads more. To get good high quality steel of more exacting alloys needs all those things to be controlled to the range of a few ppm in many cases.

Theres a reason why shitty steel is called ""Chinesium"". 

From my own experience, the highest rate of defects I've had to explain in components came down to the material being supplied (from china) not being anything like the alloy grades we specified. The supplier signed off on it being X but the mechanical properties were out by miles - the chemisty and grain structure was off only by a small amount.

Compare: We import oil. We take that oil and turn it into petrol, diesel, pharmaceuticals, lubricants, paints. We dont just repackage the shit that came out of the ground - we take it, perform complex operations on it and add a lot of value to it in the process.

Any fucking idiot (well, apart from a lot of chinese smelters it seems) can take iron ore, coke and turn out acceptable bog standard plain steel.

What we need the capacity for is the creation of good alloys. All the metallurgical wizardry that makes high, specialised technology possible. One of the big take aways that should anybody in the face when reading the history of the jet engine should be that the reason we (the west, collectively) got an edge over the germans and then the soviets because our metallurgy was that much better so parts didnt fail at high temperatures.

To get alloys for high temperatures we need strict quality control and rigorous process management, which the chinese manufacturers are lacking. As I've previously mentioned, a lot of the nominally ""good"" chinese steel thats passed through my hands actually suffered from a lot of impurity inclusions, sulphur and hydrogen embrittlement. This stuff is virtually unheard of nowadays in western practice because we have QC'd the shit out of the process, quite literally.

Because nothing currently beats the energy density of bog standard petrol or diesel. It holds a staggering amount of energy, something like 42MJ per kg. Batteries and fuel cells are far, far below this to the extent of some comical multiplier - 100x or more afaik.

 Plus you have the disadvantage that with a battery, mass is conserved and doesnt just vanish as you travel more distance - your car engine has to work less to move a smaller mass around as it burns more fuel.

- An externally powered vehicle that does NOT change altitude? So if all your effort is going to make this things spin faster and faster around the earth, when is it going to get to space? Which is, you know, upwards?

- Unpowered vehicle altitude change - Yeah, it will climb *for a while* and then drag will arrest its motion and return it to earth. This is the kind of thing I expect from a 14 year old, not somebody trying to sell me a ""new paradigm"" of spaceflight.

- No, you do not need a sixty thousand dollar computer to do it. Or $1200. You can compute this stuff with your own home pc or laptop. Brute force it if you like in python with a fucktonne of FOR loops, but for a 1D or 2D model you can do it relatively easily.

Radial engine designs

A lot of pretty pictures but nothing about how the thing could actually work. I'm left with the same questions as I would do if confronted with a pringles can and being told its a rocket engine - ""HOW?""

You can generally anticipate where subs are going to go because of the depth of water they can either safely occupy while surfaced or submerged. Theres also the classic areas where subs go to simply sit there and wait for the signal to push the button - or have you forgotten the collison between our own sub and the french nuke-carrying sub a few years ago?

As to the size of detection, the subs in the above example each had no idea the other was there...hence the collision.

861,"Eh, theres a lot of deckchair shuffling possible here depending on lots of different factors, but I think Im probably right in saying that how powerful a kettle is will be dwarfed by the amount of heat it loses to the surroundings through its walls.

Personally, I would go for a high power, plastic kettle. It will boil the fastest and lose the least amount of energy
- so long as you're generally standing by it and use it immediately after its boiled.

Stay away from ""eco"" kettles that have a metal wall, the thermal conductivity of metals are ridiculous.

Really, look at this:

http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html

Check for your favourite metals. A quick glance at amazon tells me that most are being advertised as aluminium (205)or stainless steel(16/43 if its normal steel just with a surface layer).

Compare those with typical plastics. Nylon 6,6 is 0.25. Polymethylmethacrylate (the hard clear plastics that you might find covering your car headlights or the transparent plastic kind of kettles) is 0.17-0.25. Polypropylene is 0.1-0.2. 

Even if we used stainless steel (16) against a typical average plastic (lets be lazy and call it 0.25) then you're still pissing away 64 times the energy through a stainless steel wall than a plastic wall of the same thickness assuming the same water and ambient air temperatures. 

But obviously walls arent the same thickness. Lets get funky. All these are normalised per meter, so lets multiply these numbers by some typical wall thicknesses.

Plastic - 0.25 * 0.003m for a 3mm wall = 0.00075.

Stainless - 16 * 0.0005m for a 0.5mm wall (I think thats probably about right. Its fairly thin but not coke-can levels of thin) = 0.008.

So about ten and a half times + change worse than a 3mm plastic wall.

But what if it was a stainless wall as thin as a coke can wall?
Stainless - 16 * 0.0001m for a 0.1mm wall = 0.0016.

Still about twice as bad. (2.1 times or so).

What about aluminium walls?

Aluminium(205) * 0.0005m, 5mm wall = 0.1025

Aluminium would be about 136 times as bad. Phew.

862,"In case anybody cares:

Its a tradeoff largely between three factors: The power supplied to the water, the thermal conductivity of the kettle wall and the temperature gradient between the water and the outside air (although you could kind of bundle the last two together and make that lumped bundle dependent on the power supplied).

You have this body of water sitting at a temperature thats higher than its surroundings. Because of thermodynamic reasons, if left to itself, energy rolls downhill from regions of higher ""concentration"" to lower ""concentration"". This rolling gets better (or worse depending on your viewpoint) if the temperature difference is greater. 

Theres a nice equation for this:

Q = m*C*deltaT (Energy = mass * specific heat capacity * temperature difference).

Obviously from this we can see that if there is no temperature difference, things get multiplied by zero so there is no heat transfer. If the temperature difference is likewise small, then again, the energy transferred is small.

Lets say we have a kettle holding 2 liters of water in a 20 degree temperature room. The density of water is close enough to 1kg/liter to dispense with the added complication of getting funky. Likewise, the specific heat capacity of water can be rounded to 4.2 from 4.18 kj/Kg/degree C (or K, effectively the same thing but different because *reasons*).

So if we have a kettle at 21 degrees:

Q = 2 * 4.2 * (21-20) = 8.4*1 = 8.4 kJ transferred to the room.

At 50 degrees:

Q = 2 * 4.2 * (50-20) = 8.4*30 = 252kJ transferred to the room.

At 100 degrees:

Q = 2 * 4.2 * (100-20) = 8.4 *80 = 672kJ transferred to the room.

So what else can we see from this relationship? Generally the takeaway you should get is that the hotter that something is, the quicker it can get colder because all that energy pisses across the large temperature gradient. Again, because of the same thing, you should see that as the temperature reduces closer to that of the surroundings you lose a lesser amount of heat. 

I havent included time here because that turns this exercise from a simple look-see to solving differential equations, but basically instead of a straight-line decreasing graph you get something that looks very much like a logarithmic decrement graph.

Lets rub some funk on this and include the effect of thermal conductivity of the kettle wall. Fairly straightforward, some materials are great conductors of heat (metal!) and others by comparison are fairly crap (plastic). 

(As an aside: You probably dont think about this all that often, but air is a motherfucking arsehole when it comes to heat transfer. It doesnt hold heat and its density is utterly bullshit so you need fucking tonnes of the fuckfaced material to transfer any heat worth a damn. When you open your oven tomorrow cooking your sunday roast, think about this: Your oven will probably top out at 250 degrees. If you touch anything inside it for more than a fraction of a second, it will burn you and you'll get a big fucking blister. Just how short of a distance away do you need to stand before its no longer ""OW OW FUCKING OW"" and ""Hey, this feels like that nice beach in Cornwall!"")

Anyway. The material matters. Plastic kettles dont conduct heat so they'll keep more heat in the water in the kettle. Metal kettles will gladly conduct that heat away like a mofo. (additional side note: heat transfer is also largely a function of surface area, so if you MUST get a metal kettle, at least get a smaller one. Oh, and also make it spherical.)

Finally, the power supplied to the water. Power is easily described here as the rate of transfer of energy. If you have a high power something, you transfer more energy in a given length of time than a low power something.

If you have a perfectly insulated kettle (lol nope second law) that doesnt lose any heat, then regardless of the power of the kettle, it will eventually supply the same amount of energy and raise the temperature of the same mass of water to the same level (specific heat capacity, remember, (kj/kg/deg C (or K)) is the amount of energy (kj)to raise one kilogram (kg) of water by one degree. To add to the fun, this number changes with increasing temperature &amp; pressure. Happy fucking days!). One kilo of water at, say, ten degrees and sea level pressure, will always required 4.2kj of energy to raise it to 11 degrees, whether that 4.2 kj of energy is supplied in one minute or one hour (if perfectly insulated, remember).

But we dont have perfectly insulated kettles. We have kettles made of plastic that dont conduct heat to their surroundings well, and we have metal kettles that give out heat like fucking Oprah (YOU get some heat! YOU get some heat! EVERYTHING GETS SOME HEAT!) So the power rating of a kettle matters, and it matters more if its a metal kettle because of the temperature gradient thing mentioned earlier. 

If you have a high power plastic kettle, great. Your water boils and the least amount of energy pisses away into the surroundings.

If you have a high power metal kettle, thats ok so long as you pour your cuppa immediately. Theres a high temperature difference so you start losing a lot of heat immediately, but this effect is limited so long as you pour quickly.

If you have a low power plastic kettle, thats not great. You take a longer time to boil water and you have more energy leak through the sides of your kettle during the boiling process than before.

If you have a low power metal kettle, you lose. You're supplying a low amount of energy per second and your energy losses per second are also the highest.

Incidentally, this is the exact reason why Tea Cosies are a thing. They trap a layer of air next to the kettle that quickly (in theory, at least) warms up to be the same temperature as the kettle so little or no transfer can occur as the temperature difference is either zero or so low as to not be worth considering.

936,"&gt; Why would you have to buy the same thing twice? It states in the general undergraduate student handbook, and it states extremely clearly in the engineering UG handbook, that a particular calculator bought from the LGoS shop is required. It is made abundantly clear.

Quote from linked thread:

&gt;The model is a Casio fx-83ES. Bog standard scientific calc right? However even if you own the exact model, you are not allowed to use the calculator in exams if it was not bought from the uni.

The FX-83 series has been the de-facto scientific calculator you pick up pretty much anywhere for maybe the last 15 years. I've still got my GCSE one in a drawer somewhere. So if youve already taken GCSE Maths, or A level sciences/maths/economics or anything where you might have to plug some numbers into an equation instead of writing an essay, you'll most likely already have one.

Except, fuck you, you cant use the calculator you've already got, you need to shell out for a new one. And at £12, when you can pick one up from Amazon for £8.50.

&gt;
I don't think it's fair to ensure that every examiner is familiar with the capability of every make and model of calculator that is in existence.

I think you could fit a list of the most common approved calculators on half a side of A4 printed at a reasonable size. Even then, there are big and obvious indicators of calculators capable of the kind of operations that get them disqualified to exclude the ones not on the approved list.",2016-01-29 13:40:48+00:00,czgcg80,4,t1_czgbs0p,1600,unitedkingdom

That said, here's me putting my oar in:

1) Ditch the third page. Find a way to work in that stuff without it being in tabulated format.

2) Youre 26 with 6 years in the industry. Nobody cares about your A levels given your record of continuing education through HNC/Foundation Degree/BEng.

3) Personal statement is flat and pretty boilerplate. You need to find some way of livening this up and some reason why youre applying to the  job you are with your experience.

My own field is in analytics, so I emphasised the amount of study I've undertaken in CFD/FEA theory and relevant experience with Fluent, Nastran and Abaqus.

4) Education Section

Your third page should go here showing what you studied where and when. Particularly on the degree, employers like to see what you did your dissertation in and what you managed to learn from it. 

6) Key skills section

Everyone has this and so you are obligated to as well, I guess. Still pretty boilerplate and in need of livening up. Good to emphasise your skills with software, the more esoteric and specialised to your industry the better.

7) Professional Memberships

Probably better to simply include these as letters after your name.

8) Employment

Ditch the work experience.

Tech Apprentice is fine, although I'd put in the actual qualifications you studied (""Studied part time for my HNC/as applicable""). The grades you have are self evident.

Assistant Design Engineer - Obviously you've got a lot of experience here but this part is nothing like as polished as it could be.

Lead with ""Graduate role on over 50 projects"". Follow with typical tasks. Finish with examples of good projects like youve done.

G35 report? Is that an industry standard? No idea what that is. Re describe in more general terms. ""Adept at writing reports to satisfy legislative requirements"" for example.

1009,"A broad overview is that cfd is the science of solving continuous partial differential equations with discrete methods due to the nature of computing.

Because of this, it's a standard to loop an algorithm solving an equation using the last answer as an input - eg, your mass flow out of a system. The residual is the residual difference either between your defined output and the last iteration of the algorithm, or simply the last iteration of the algorithm and its penultimate iteration.

Eg, in Fluent and Converge (and I assume star ccm) you have the option to specify residual tolerance, let's say 1e-6. The algorithm will continue until the difference between the last two iterations is less than 1e-6, indicating that the simulation has converged to an answer that is reasonable.

Obviously, the large changes (e-1 to e-3?) happen very quickly and the majority of time is spent grinding down through e-4 to e-6 (and beyond if the work needs it or if just being particularly finicky) as the step change between iterations is very small, and getting even smaller still with each iteration.

So to sum up:

They are important because they tell you how well the simulation has converged to an acceptable approximation of real life flow.*

You want them as low as *practicably* possible within your limitations of time. Setting tighter tolerances (1e-8 instead of 1e-6 for example) will increase your run time by a lot.

Your use of symmetry is good but you need to accurate capture any flow features that might result - are you using an inviscid case? Turbulent drag is a big issue with racing cars so you should not be using inviscid and you should look up a thing called the Strouhal number to check the size of your mesh against the likely size of eddies. You need a mesh size of at least a half (preferably less) the size of expected eddies to capture them.

1500 iterations is low. Way too low for your simulation. I wouldn't trust it or treat it as in the same ballpark as real life at less than 5000 iterations, but this really depends on your mesh size, model setup and turbulence model.

*ish, there's a lot to cfd but this is just a brief overview.

1025,"Thought I'd flesh out this response somewhat with regard to the aerodynamics.

By the end of the second world war, the advent of both high speed piston engine fighters and early jets meant that aircraft manufacturers were coming up hard against the sonic barrier. 

Aerodynamics does some very funny things in the approach to Mach 1 (and beyond it) and data in this flow regime was thin on the ground. There are a lot of interacting effects and theres nothing that really stands out as an issue because they all were issues - engine inlets, wing design, control surface flutter, all sorts of things. 

Torque tonight is really quite right here in saying that the Lightning was something of a shot in the dark, design wise. If you look at the jets in service before then, a lot are plainly derived from existing aircraft (Supermarine in particular being guilty of this) which flew in regimes where the aerodynamics were very well understood. Supersonic flight really wasnt well understood in ""general circulation"" until probably about 1980 I would say. The SR71 is something of a masterpiece outlier since it was created by Lockheed's skunkworks, but otherwise most other manufacturers had large, dangerous problems with aircraft flight handling until about then.",2015-11-30 14:34:33+00:00,cxhwrhk,8,t1_cxhvcnf,3504,unitedkingdom

1051,"1) My machine is mainly (well, at least, I tell myself that) built for running complex CFD simulations for my thesis, so the only heat source I really have to worry about is the processor. What I've got is probably overkill, but I havent had a good chance to stress test it yet - planning on doing that with BF4 when I get home. :getin:

Since HPB junior is gaming, thats two intensive sources of heat - the processor and the graphics card, especially a double- slot monster like that card. Its got plenty of fans on the card itself, but you generally need some more fans to move air into/out of the case rather than relying on natural convection. 

On my old PC I added a single 120mm fan on the backplate and saw my CPU temps drop 10 degrees.

2) The 2300 has a few fans included - make sure you get the right size ones for the other positions though. Its also probably worth getting some dust filters.

You'll need 2 x 140mm fans/filters for the top positions, and a 120mm for the rear position. It comes with 2 120mm fans already. I moved the one from the rear position to the second forward position so I've got three fans blowing air out, two fans forcing air in, and a couple of open vents for natural draught airflow.

You could go hog wild and get another couple of 120mm fans for the case side and bottom positions, but frankly thats overkill.

Make sure you tell HPB junior ""No drinks near the PC!"" because of the top vents, too.",2015-11-23 14:38:46+00:00,cxa58i1,3,t1_cxa4wta,697,unitedkingdom
1052,"I put together a system just this weekend thats not a million miles away from what youve got there.

I'd suggest that you go with Novatech or Scan. Theyre generally cheaper than other places with great customer service.

A couple of points:

1) Theres nothing there about after market coolers for the CPU. I got the nearly standard issue Coolermaster Hyper 212 Evo for about £25 and a bunch of 120mm fans for £4 or so each. In fact, I've now got so many fans and cooling air that instead of keeping my room toasty warm with the old machine I just move the air around with the new.

2) You need to be careful with the fractal design case. I got a Core 2300 and it was... ok to build in, but there are a few things you need to look out for and it pays to plan ahead with your build order. I would never have got the cooling fans in after I got the motherboard in, for example. 

Something to really look out for is that your 5.25"" CD drive clears your motherboard/top fan corner, as well as the main ATX power connector.

Generally, though, I would worry about having enough space in the 1100 case since its that much smaller than the 2300.

3) If youve got a windows 7 install disc or the like, you can get away with installing windows 7 on the new machine and then using the free upgrade microsoft offer to get win 10 - although be careful with network drivers, mine shat the bed and I had to edit a bunch of settings to get them to work reliably.

1058,"Further to andyjeffs response, yes, you would be boned using work resources for your own personal commercial interests.

You would have to buy your own copy of Solidworks and yes it's a big chunk of money. That said, having previously looked into it, there's nothing out there that has the capabilities of solidworks for the same price, especially on the fea/cfd side. A render package alone like keyshot will run to about a grand and a half by itself.

But a big offputting thing for me is the new solidworks pricing scheme. Get it one year and pay a good chunk of the upfront cost per year for upgrades - or get it this year and don't pay for the upgrades, but when you do upgrade it, you have to pay the back subscription costs on top. It's ridiculous and been widely hounded as being a dumb idea and pushed a lot of people towards fusion 360.

Again, for me, solidworks' cfd and fea isn't that sophisticated compared to stuff I use on a daily basis (NX Nastran, Converge CFD) so I would want the updates each year. As a start up it would be cost prohibitive compared to what it is capable of. 

So I guess its swings and roundabouts. It's the best thing out there for its single price point - but each part individually isn't the greatest and you stand a good chance of being charged through the nose by dassault for the privilege.",2015-11-23 07:59:56+00:00,cx9yffd,1,t3_3twtvx,5734,SolidWorks

Theres a weird-ish culture around air crashes involving fatalities that generally the pilot should have had the decency to die himself since he failed to put bystanders out of danger. 

This crash is a major exception that rule because:

A) Its pretty clear from the video that the guy didnt have enough relevant velocity for the aircraft to respond adequately to control inputs.

B) The News/ AAIB has already released information that the guy tried to eject. Personally I find this trend of information release around air crashes is a fucking poison to the air accident investigation process because it lends to massive speculation by a lot of people who dont have the faintest fucking idea.

C) For the manner of the aircrafts impact, lack of horizontal speed/generous vertical speed and massive fireball, the odds that the guy actually survived are vanishingly small. Absolutely minute. I had a look through a lot of air accidents involving single seat fighter aircraft that pancaked in a similar manner and the shoreham pilot might well be the only guy (or one of a short handfull between 1 and 3) to survive this manner of air crash since the 1950s.

As youre constantly producing thrust your orbit becomes a spiral and over time your use of propellant gets even more efficient as you progressively escape the earths gravity.

Crap instructor then uses the brakes on his side to stop the car opposite the Audi's window, uses the controls on his side to wind *my* window down and engages in a blazing argument with the Audi driver for a minute right across my face.

You're also apparently specifying that Mars has a constant velocity (mars.v = vector(-100,540,0)) when it will change as it moves, maximising at periapsis and minimising at apoapsis. I think you've also messed up on the scale of the velocity vector since if youre going for Km/s you should be multiplying that up somewhat.

[You'll need to look at the Vis Viva equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation) and, as the above poster said, dynamically calculate the properties of mars at each time step (ie, each time through the loop).

As hard as it might be to comprehend, people can have differing opinions on things including your beloved party. Multiple people, in fact. There's no conspiracy between the mentioned subs other than a nod in each other's direction for being of a like opinion. 

Personally, I think that Ukip actually has a lot of damn fine points to make. But its fan club (especially on Reddit), speaking charitably, leave a hell of a lot to be desired.

There are only two, maybe three kippers that I see around on a regular basis that haven't gone for white supremacist topics. The main moderator of ukipparty is also a mod of a renowned white supremacist subreddit, who threw a massive wobbly over being asked to remove himself from ukipparty to avoid tarring ukip with the same white supremacist brush. He refused.

1195,"&gt;The biggest issue with this is that its quite late in the year to enroll at a new university

Dont worry too much about this so long as you're willing to be persistent. A lot of universities will accept students from clearing for a very long time, sometimes up to two weeks after the start of term. If you do have to go this route, be sure you get all your paperwork from your current university - a complete transcript of your modules and grades. The university I was at took a very long time to do this so make a complete arsehole of yourself if you need to in order to get that piece of paper. Go in person to the office, demand the transcript then and there and dont leave until you get it. Bring a book and sit in the corner if you have to, its a single day of waiting compared to maybe a year or two years of lost time.

&gt;Thanks, that was the decision I was leaning towards but I have a meeting with the faculty tomorrow to see if they'll let me do that at my current uni or if I'll have to shift elsewhere. 

Generally, though, unless youve been a complete arsehole you should be able to stay on the course and repeat the modules - unis these days are desperate for the extra cash if nothing else. Also, dont worry about the fees - the student loan company generally allows you fees for at least one resit year, so dont fuck it up.

If you do have to go elsewhere - try clearing. Then, if that doesnt work, try simply ringing the university of choice's admissions office and ask to speak to relevant people. You'd be surprised what you can get away with having rung and spoken to people instead of just being an anonymous name on a computer screen.",2015-09-13 08:54:25+00:00,cuzv63m,3,t1_cuzutx6,1502,aerospace
1196,"You failed *at* the end of your second year, or you have failed the second year by itself?  Its a minor difference since the answer is generally the same - stick with it. Repeat the year and continue or take your accumulated credits and enrol at a different institution. 

I've been in your shoes with mech eng, except that when I left my first university I wasnt awarded credit for any of the second year stuff I had done. I got onto another mech eng course at a different university and basically started over. I imagine youre in something of the same boat if youve got 2/3rds of the required to start the third year - you'd probably leave with a Cert HE which only accounts for the first year of your course. I wasnt able to get an engineering job in the year between leaving one university and starting at the other with just the Cert HE - employers had no idea what it was and trying to equate it with an HNC didnt work because I just didnt have the practical experience.

My advice to you is to retake your failed modules. Yes, I know it sucks, you'll be a year behind your friends and all the rest of it. But take it from me, the alternative is worse. The jobs out there that you'll likely get without a degree will be far more interminable than ones that require a degree. You wont have the option to simply get up and walk away, you'll frequently be stuck under oppressive and aggravating management. 

If youre only repeating a few modules, be sensible and use the extra time youve got on your hands to do something productive - dont just sit around in your underwear playing games. Get a retail job, or try and swing some work experience at companies around Sheffield. I imagine theres at least a couple out there that would accept having somebody interested around two or three times a week.

The biggest thing you need to do, though, is sit down and be really brutally honest with yourself about why you failed, and change that part about yourself. Spend too much time partying? Cut down your nights out. Too much drinking? Lay off the sauce. Not interested? Find something else to do with your life. Didnt study hard enough? Cane it in the library.

Feel free to ask any questions.

TLDR: Retake your failed modules. It sucks, but the alternatives outside your university are generally worse.",2015-09-13 08:19:27+00:00,cuzuoyq,1,t3_3krdva,2032,aerospace

&gt;As for wind, do you mean my wing slowing the wind down is an issue? I understand that I need fluid moving past the wing in order for the pressure differential and ram air to generate lift.

This is correct - I thought that you had misunderstood the need for at least one static and one moving frame of reference with either the wing moving with respect to static air, or moving air with a static wing.

You will probably also want to look at ways of constructing the wing so that it is light, strong and transmits loads to your platform well - so a look at wing structures (spars, ribs, etc) are in order. Additionally, if this thing is static you'll probably want to look at including some high lift devices to squeeze out every ounce of lift you can manage.",2015-08-13 13:12:12+00:00,cu1izp5,3,t1_cu1hie1,3702,CFD
1239,"I take it you're not an engineer? Because this post has ""no experience, no idea and no willingness to learn"" written all over it. Given a high enough wind speed you could simply have a barn door at an angle to create lift - airfoils are more subtle.

&gt;I'm doing a project where I want to have a cantilevering platform lifted by wind forces. 

So far, so simple - so long as either said platform is sufficiently light or wing (or barn door) sufficiently large.

&gt;I need an airfoil that generates as much lift as possible, with drag not being an issue, 

Drag is always an issue. It never goes away. You're looking for the best lift to drag ratio or at least best lift assuming low wind speeds.

&gt;the airfoil slowing down is not an issue, as it is stationary laterally. 

This really betrays your lack of understanding, I think. The airfoil slowing down isnt the issue, but your wind speed is. Without fluid moving past it that airfoil is not going to generate any lift.

&gt;What wing design is best for this type of application? 

Without knowing your design parameters we can only talk in general terms - a high lift wing type, at low speeds youre probably going to be wanting something highly cambered. You need to figure out the amount of weight you want to lift and the typical expected wind speed at your installation site as a priority.

&gt;Is there any online resources that can help? 

Airfoildb isnt a terrible resource, but your lack of understanding will highly limit your ability to use it or select a usable profile relevant to your needs.

&gt;What (preferably free) programs is useful for figuring this out?

Theres nothing free that I know of that is suitable here. Theres no free option that is both user friendly enough and detailed enough. You could try Openfoaming it but I doubt if you know what airfoil to look for you're going to get on well with it.

Relatively cheap options? Well, if you can stump circa ~£100 and you or someone you know is currently enrolled in university study you can get a Solidworks student licence, which is last years commercial top of the line Solidworks package with CFD that should be adequate for your needs.

More than anything else, though, you need to have some kind of idea about airfoils before you start dicking around with them.

The first thing I'd recommend is simply to chill out, and slowly start assembling things you need come September. The first year of most courses is largely a rehashing of A level mathematics and some easy introductory material. Since youve already done mechanics 1 &amp; 2 you should be pretty well set.

The second is to get some books. ON NO ACCOUNT GET BOOKS FROM THE UNIVERSITY ON CAMPUS BOOKSHOP. Why? Because theyre fucking vultures and will charge you £100 per book at the blink of an eye.

Do the smart thing and look up books on Amazon - do the *smarter* thing and check for older editions that are really knocked down in price but carry essentially all the same material as the newer editions bar a few changed diagrams; and the *smartest* thing by getting them secondhand sometimes for only a nominal penny charge and the cost of shipping.

Mathematics:

[Mathematics for Engineers by Croft &amp; Davidson](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mathematics-Engineers-Modern-Interactive-Approach/dp/013120193X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439206549&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=engineering+mathematics+croft+davidson)

Some people prefer [Stroud's](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Engineering-Mathematics-K-A-Stroud/dp/0333919394/ref=pd_sim_14_4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0103QEHWNET2TZDXWWD4) approach instead, but the Croft &amp; Davidson book has served me pretty well all the way up through my B. Eng and now my MSc. 

Thermodynamics

[Fundamentals of Thermal Fluid Sciences](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fundamentals-Thermal-Fluid-Sciences-Yunus-Cengel/dp/007123926X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439206002&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=fundamentals+of+thermal+fluid) by Cengel &amp; Turner is a pretty great introduction and should just about get you through your degree. 

You might want to look around for a very similar book by Cengel &amp; Boles that covers a few topics in more detail (IE, more compressible flow, fanno, rayleigh, a bit more detail on heat transfer).

Statics / Dynamics

In the three universities I've studied at, all of my instructors have preferred Meriam/Kraige's works on [Statics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Engineering-Mechanics-Statics-5e-WSE/dp/0471266078/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1JHM7F4QY1F2NAXN6HV3)  and [Dynamics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Engineering-Mechanics-Dynamics-J-Meriam/dp/0471787035). The best of my tutors with a PHd in nonlinear dynamics recommended parts of [Hibbeler's books](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Engineering-Mechanics-Dynamics-Russell-Hibbeler/dp/9810681372/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439207119&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Engineering+Dynamics) but largely kept to Meriam/Kraige because its more accessible. Its a great book, but his notation is slightly different and it can be confusing going from one to the other.

Stress Analysis

I cant really recall being recommended any books by any of my lecturers (mostly because lecture notes fill in the gap) but I do remember seeing a lot of people recommending Roark's Stress and Strain. Eh, its ok, but it is ponderous in the extreme and not that accessible. As I remember the vast majority of it is little more than a set of lookup tables.

The books I will recommend you'll probably not find recommended anywhere else. I only came across them by chance in a charity bookshop and got extremely lucky. 

You'll be wanting the[ Mechanical Science for Technicians volumes 1](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mechanical-Science-Technicians-Ian-McDonagh/dp/0713135115/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439207548&amp;sr=1-3) [&amp; 2](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mechanical-Science-Technicians-Ian-McDonagh/dp/0713134453/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439207548&amp;sr=1-1) by Ian McDonaugh. Get the second hand cheap as shit ones because its pointless spending £40 on an A5 handbook. 

These books are fucking great. They keep everything simple, straightforward and to the point; breaking concepts down easily and with lots of worked examples. 

My third recommendation is to go looking for these books in PDF form and get yourself a shitty tablet to essentially serve as a changeable textbook. Most of these books (excepting the McDonaugh) are A4 sized and over an inch thick and you'll quick get an aching back carrying them around all the time. I picked one up from Novatech for £50 a couple of years ago and keep it solely as a bookreader.

Fourth, get yourself a TI36x for a calculator. Yes, I know its not graphical or programmable and it lacks some other cool things that other TI calculators like the 84/89 have. What it *is*, though, is UK university exam legal because it isnt programmable to the extent that the 84 &amp; 89 are. You dont want to be walking into an exam with a calculator you dont know how to use - and more to the point you probably wont have time or a need to graph stuff on your calculator in your courses.

Other people here have recommended learning Latex. Eh, if you want to then by all means do so but it seems to be very much a USA thing and is not either standard practice or a substantial alternate practice over here in the UK. 

Getting into a good sleeping pattern and person habits is crucial. You'll be sorely tempted to spend a lot of your free time drinking and clubbing, but practice some restraint and your marks will thank you for it.

Having practical machining experience is a rarity to the extent that you might be the only one in your class that has done anything. Try not to shriek at people throwing micrometers around or dropping try squares.

Or looking at any aircraft development project. Delays of many years are normal.

Plus as far as I know they've only successfully demo'd the precooler under lab conditions - this validation study isnt the same thing as a hot fire test. They have a *lot* of work to do to get it operational on the ground before they even think of putting it into a craft.

As you said, np.diagonal will return the principle diagonal (P). I need the other diagonals as well (1-8). As far as I can see it, I can go through the offsets with a for loop something along the lines of:

    for i in range(-arraysize, arraysize):
        pointsx = np.diagonal(array,i)

But I dont think this will give me a nice clean output - not only because this rough example will overwrite with each index, but also because if I wrapped it in a function to spawn a new array each time it does a diagonal I'm then left with lots of new arrays that then have to be plotted individually - not overly terrible for a 5x5 array but extremely laborious for a 50x50 or even larger.",2015-07-16 09:47:09+00:00,ct56vch,6,t1_ct4yy4b,22526,learnpython

That said, its been pretty plain since 2008 that the EU as it currently stands is not fit for purpose. Its not neccessarily evil by default, but it leaves a hell of a lot to be desired. 

With particular regard to greece, the single currency union might be the singlemost cynical aspect of the EU. Countries with their own currency have the option to devalue it nationally in order to attract trade from elsewhere. Lumped together into a single block countries of incredibly different economic strength have to twist and contort on a local level to fit the value of the euro. Germany essentially has ""its"" currency devalued by the presence of many other worse off nations sharing the same currency, so it manages to keep its exports high. Its the worst kind of manipulation of averages, cancelling out the single high anomaly with a plethora of much smaller values.

There are lots of other issues like the CAP and free movement - but I have no idea how I would alter those to be more representative or beneficial in anything like a fair manner (or at least so everyone is sufficiently aggrieved).

I've previously used this kind of scheme to iteratively fill an array in a similar manner in the same script, so I dont know why it works in that previous array and not for this one. Also, at the moment for some reason it calculates the first two columns fine and then stops.

How would I go about modifying the function to overcome this? Modifying the expression to calculate upper and lower boundaries to:
 
    for j in range(mesh_size-1):
       for [i, j] in np.argwhere(np.isnan(initial_x_coords)):
           x_coords[0,j] = (initial_y_coords[1,j-1]+(initial_x_coords[1,j-1]*ini_dist_pos[0,j-1]))/ini_dist_pos[0,j-1]

If its set to iterate over indexes 1-3 in i(rows) and 0-4 in j (columns) then at no point does it exceed 4 in j as all the j terms are -1; and at no point does it exceed 4 in i as there are no i+2 terms.

For negative indices, again, the terms are i-1 and j-1 in varying combinations - because of the indexing limits are 1-3 in i and 0-4 in j, the limits of the array are not exceeded in i. They could be in j (if j = 0 then obvious j-1 goes out of the array)- but because the first column is prescribed elsewhere it skips this problematic index.

So with the apparent problematic index skipped, and with the first column &amp; top and bottom rows of the array already accounted for in the function, I dont understand why this function shudders to a halt when it doesnt try to call an index outside the limits of the array or range.

1392,"&gt; Is there anyone here who can give some information on genuine improvements on this? Obviously electrics cars are on the up, but I'm be interested in knowing a little more on the developments within the aviation industry.

Theres a lot going on with the aero engine industry at the minute, although ""a lot"" is hard to recognise due to the glacial pace of development and implementation. 

The general trend is increasing the amount of bypass air, since you can generally move that and generate thrust at a much higher efficiency than by burning fuel. Essentially you have a situation where you can either accelerate a large mass of air by not very much (propellors, propfans, high-bypass engines) or a relatively small mass of air by a lot (core of a jet engine, IE, straight turbojet with no bypass). 

Recently, (bearing in mind the glacial pace of the industry, ~15-20years) the oil price has been rising so the direction has been to increase fuel efficiency, so a greater amount of bypass has been steadily introduced along with some other technical wizardry thats largely tinkering around the edges. This increasing amount of bypass can be seen in the increasing diameter of engines - although there is a practical limit to the diameter because you can simply hang increasing diameter engines off a wing before it strikes the ground unless you move the wing upwards.

Regardless, the bypass ratio thing is key, because it means that a large amount of cold air is being moved. 

In a jet engine exhaust, you expel a hot, very fast jet of gas into a cold, relatively slow gas. This causes a lot of [turbulent shear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SbI7PO6Mtk) between the two gas regions, which is generally where a lot of jet engine noise comes from.

You have two regions with a sharp step between velocities (hot/cold) in the case of a turbojet. With a turbofan (Ie, with bypass) you have the slow cold outside air, the quicker cold bypass air and the fast,hot core gas. Theres a smaller step size between the velocities of each gas region, so the turbulence is less and the noise is less. You can think of it being like a set of steps - if you jumped from thirty feet to the floor, you stand a good chance of breaking a leg. If you split that into three jumps of ten feet each you'll probably have a better time.

With turbulence theres also a certain size that the vortices can be depending on the relative velocities of the two fluid layers. If you have a sufficiently thick outer bypass air layer then the vortices from the core region dont ""break out"" and noise is substantially reduced.

So far I've only gone into turbulent shear between parallel layers, but the other big thing is scalloping edges on the engine to promote turbulent mixing Ie, the wavy edges:

http://s296.photobucket.com/user/Cheat11/media/787engine.jpg.html
http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/autopia/2012/09/IMG_6397-660x439.jpg

Now I know what you're thinking: this guy just told me that turbulent mixing is bad and produces noise, so why are these things making things more turbulent a good thing?

Well, its because they effectively ""insert"" yet another layer with a different velocity between regions, so again the velocity jump between regions (and turbulent shear) is even smaller, so less noise is produced. While this scalloping decreases propulsive efficiency, the offset by the reduced weight of noise insulation on the aircraft actually comes out as a net benefit.

The engines are generally the key thing. Theres a lot of work in other areas, like increasing composites in the structure, but because the industry is so conservative they generally take the same size and shape as aluminium components so the weight saved isnt that great, so the industry is looking into mathematical optimisation to only provide strength where the structure really needs it to save weight elsewhere.",2015-07-01 09:43:29+00:00,csoj4m8,2,t1_csoh3r8,8154,ukpolitics
