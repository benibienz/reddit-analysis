Since our wedding is coming up we've both been looking for jobs in Norway since about mid June, and while she's found plenty of jobs in her industry, I've found that for my area of expertise in engineering (bachelors mechanical, aerospace masters - a *lot* of heavy computational simulation) there's close to fuck all.

I've tried NAV, Finn, TU, and talking to NITO and Tekna, but its looking like there is nothing out there for me unless I choose to do a doctorate in something I don't care very much for. There's stuff out there for sanitation, roads, tunnels and the like, but not a lot for things that have to move.

In the process I've got a bunch of reactions but the textbooks I've got generally discount all the higher complexity molecules and assume a gibbs equilibrium between the initial reactants and the products (which are typically CO2 and H2O and in turn subject to the water-gas equilibrium situation). 

In my day job I'm involved in simulating combustion in IC engines via CFD with complete coupled chemistry, so I know that along the way theres all kind of weird shit produced when burning hydrocarbons at ~2500K and ~150+bar pressure.

Are there any rules of thumb for the more likely complex molecules that are going to form, or should I stick with the complete combustion reduction? 

Two further questions:

1) Its been a long time since I've balanced chemical equations by hand, but am I right in thinking that I can cross-multiply mole fractions? The formula for RP-1 is given in one of my references as C1.953H2 - I could simplifiy this by assuming ~C2H2 as a general formula but its not quite on the money.

2) I've seen repeated references to ""third body efficiencies"". Can anyone give a good reference for understanding these and how they are defined?

1) Best of the Subreddit

I thought we'd do a voted Best of Bad for the last year or so since the subs creation. If you would like to nominate a post that was spectacularly bad, do so in this thread. On /around the 14th of December I'll create a post for voting on the worst.

2) NP.REDDIT.COM LINKS ARE NOT OPTIONAL

In recent weeks people have been a bit slack and some golden bullshit has fallen through the cracks. Please remember to submit with an NP.REDDIT.COM link.

3) Low hanging fruit

Posts from /r/european, unless specifically about a current political issue in the UK, are off limits until further notice. Its like shooting fish in a barrel there.

4) Frivolous reports

Please save the reports for something that needs it - or go for some good comic relief.

5) Archiving.

For some unknown reason, /u/ttumblrbots isnt archiving submissions automatically anymore. :( 

There are a variety of archival methods out there - I would appreciate it if you could use one while submitting so that theres actually something to gawk at instead of a [deleted] tag.

6) [Effort](http://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-effort.gif)

Come on, you lot. The last week or so has been a veritable goldmine of bullshit and yet barely any makes it here. When I get back tonight theres a long list of posts I need to grab. If you could at least throw something in I might waive the no personal involvement guideline/archiving thing.

Truly stunning comment from Leetenghui here:

[""Back in the 90s I remember being in a mixed school of white and Pakistanis. The Pakistanis came from families with 10+ children. It was unusual for one of my peers to have small numbers of children. The Chinese families \(3 in the school\) had 2 at most. The biggest white family was 3 children. We've all grown up and are mid 30s now. The area where I grew up is about 15 miles away. I've been back and many of them have 5-7 children each. So the old argument of once they are educated more the fertility rate declines to match the native population. Except it doesn't in some communities. As said I was a child in the 80s and 90s. By the 90s it was the 2nd generation of overseas born parents. We've had 3rd and 4th generations and the birth rate isn't declining. In 2001 there were 1.5 million Muslims. By 2012 there were 2.8 million. So we can assume a doubling every 10 years. On this basis 2022 - 6 million then a doubling every 10 years. By 2035-2050 they will be the majority and the UK will be a sharia law state."" [+5]](http://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3n7pz1/britain_deeply_divided_over_refugee_influx_as_the/cvlm7em)

[""Not every form of genocide involves gas chambers and campaigns of mass murder. The UN's definition of genocide includes the mention of 'conditions that are designed to bring about the end of the existence of an ethnic group'.
Importing millions of non-whites into the country who have birth rates up to 5 times that of white Britons, while simultaneously forcing white communities and groups to accept these people through mandatory diversity quotas and shaming language, all the while blathering on about how white people don't actually exist or have any culture of our own whereas everyone else does, are all mentalities that if enacted together would lead to the ethnic displacement of white Britons in their homeland and their eventual genocide by out breeding. Once a critical threshold of non-whites was reached it would be electorally impossible for white Britons to ever be represented unless by sympathetic non-whites backed by their electoral majority.

[This isn't baseless paranoia, as groups like ISIS have attempted the genocide of minority groups like the Yazidis. Now you can say that not all Muslims are genocidalists but they don't all have to be for them to take power. The majority of Syrians aren't genocidal maniacs and yet much of their country is controlled by people who are, because enough Muslims are genocidal maniacs for those who are to form a serious army and seize power.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3n7pz1/britain_deeply_divided_over_refugee_influx_as_the/cvlqnky)

[Even if a physical genocide wasn't attempted here, the world that we are making for ourselves is going to be a horror. Germany has taken in 800,000 refugees this year alone, most of them Muslims. That's 5 times the number of native German births, and if they take in more refugees next year and the year after, when we factor in the fertility rate of these people, they are inviting upon themselves the statistical certainty that their country will become majority Muslim. The left wants us to take in similar numbers here.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3n7pz1/britain_deeply_divided_over_refugee_influx_as_the/cvlqnky)

[Many on the left are indifferent to this or believe that a Muslim majority Germany or Britain would just be exactly the same but with people with darker skin. Yet if we look at what these people largely believe, there is no evidence that our culture will remain the same and every single piece of available evidence points to the fact that it will make our country demonstrably worse. The crime rate of refugees from these countries is absurdly high, with most of the violent crime aimed at white people. They are in their majority against Western notions of gay rights and women's rights, and notions of 'tolerating the minority' are totally alien to them. The only reason such concepts are present in their countries at all is by Western export. They haven't arrived at the same cultural conclusions as white Westerners mostly have and there's nothing in the world right now that leads me to believe that being a minority white population under a majority non-white/Muslim population would be anything other than outright subjugation and Dhimmitude. This is why we call it genocide.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3n7pz1/britain_deeply_divided_over_refugee_influx_as_the/cvlqnky)

[The statistics cannot be argued. If Germany carries on at their current rate they will be majority non-white with Islam as the state religion within three generations. And they're doing this because of a picture of a dead Syrians boy? This is insanity. If you believe that being a minority white population under a Muslim plurality and non-white majority would be just fine and things would stay the same, I'd strongly ask for some evidence that that would actually be the case and isn't just a Utopian fantasy.""[+9] ](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3n7pz1/britain_deeply_divided_over_refugee_influx_as_the/cvlqnky)

[This will lead to the complete subjugation of the white population**, and I say this based on the way that Muslims poll in regards to the concept of minority rights as well as the current treatment of minorities in Muslim countries. Women's rights and gay rights would be a thing of the past, the inter Islam conflicts would now be British conflicts and we'd see levels of terror attacks on par with a country like Syria. With the democratic majority in the hands of Muslims there would be a serious threat of Islamist maniacs seizing power, as evidenced by the fact that much of Syria is in control of a genocidal, maniacal group like ISIS despite the fact that most Muslims are not genocidal maniacs. This possibility when coupled wih the fact of Britain's military capability and nuclear stockpiles is utterly terrifying. If some extremist Islamist group were to seize power that would almost certainly result in the mass gang rape and sexual enslavement of white women as well as the mass murder of white men, as demonstrated by the treatment of the Yazidis by ISIS.](http://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3n7pz1/britain_deeply_divided_over_refugee_influx_as_the/cvluqd9)


[**Thus I say that our current levels of migration will eventually lead to the subjugation and ethnic displacement and long term extinction of the white population due to interbreeding and sheer numerical disadvantage, as a best case scenario. There is also the possibility of a physical campaign of genocide by mass murder which could happen via an Islamist minority seizing power once Islam is a majority religion. The increase in immigration demanded by mentally ill left wing sociopaths would hasten both of these possibilities.**](http://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3n7pz1/britain_deeply_divided_over_refugee_influx_as_the/cvluqd9)


[The idea that we can live peacefully as a white minority in a majority African/Islamic country is laughable and not backed up by any evidence, whether it be historical or of the current world. **The absolute best case scenario is to live on heavily segregated and armed reservations so we can avoid the indiscriminate interracial attacks, rapes and murders that we would be the target of, based on current rates of interracial crime extrapolated into the future.""**](http://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3n7pz1/britain_deeply_divided_over_refugee_influx_as_the/cvlw44z)

Up until now I've firmly been in the Solidworks camp but 360 has really turned my head. Its kind of the difference between ""Do a bit of everything I could imagine but really expensive"" or ""Do the things I really need for nearly free"". 

The things I'm really worried about losing are the simulation abilities of Solidworks. Its been really handy to check the strength of a component with a quick and dirty two minute FEA simulation; or to simply check the forces/accelerations on linkages with a motion study.

As far as I can see F360 doesnt have that kind of detail available with its motion studies and the FEA/CFD simulation is run in the cloud on a pay-as-you-go basis which I'm pretty leery at given that its been pretty normal practice to simply run as many simulations as possible to ensure that the part/product is as optimal as you can get it. It seems like a good way to throw a lot of money into a hole in the ground compared to the benefit you actually get at the end of the day.

Why am I getting this error? I'm only indexing in one dimension along the column, in both nslope and pslope,right? Or is it because I've been indexing in i and j in the parent function to account for the different sizes of the slope arrays and the variable arrays?

All the inputs are arrays - ini_dist_neg and ini_dist_pos are 4x4 (and so index between 0 &amp; 3) and initial_x_coords and initial_y_coords are 5x5 and index over 0,4. The initial x /y coords are initialised as 5x5 arrays of NaN, have the initial column populated with values (external to this function) and then the function solves the columns from left to right using the values from the column to its immediate left.

mesh_size is 5 and is generally used to size the arrays so this can scale for better detail.

When I run my script with this function, I get an error:

IndexError: index 5 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 5

Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/aPZTig8P

I've run into an issue where I can't quite get my function to solve a bunch of arrays to work and I feel like I'm missing something fairly big and obvious. 

For this first part I'm trying to fill in the arrays initial_theta and initial_nu - the others (initial_mu , initial_mach) can be calculated later. They're initialised as nxn arrays of nan. Both initial_theta and initial_nu have had some initial fuckery to populate them with some desired boundary conditions (at the extremities of each array) before they get solved for the internal points. 

Solving the two matrices should populate each other with values of theta and nu to fill in the remaining NaN values.

Each array point is solved using the array points one column preceeding and the rows above and below the current row. I cant for the life of me get the function right for solving these arrays together, though (lines 129-end).

Essentially I'm trying to implement a loop in the last function to get it to look for values of NaN, and where they're found, use the preceeding column's values to calculate the current array element value; and then continue looping until arrays initial_nu and initial_theta are filled in from left to right until no elements in the array are NaN.

I'm new to Python though, so I dont know exactly how to implement this loop while any NaN values remain. Any help would be really appreciated.",learnpython,How do I tell a function to iterate while an array contains elements that are NaN?,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/3bfd89/how_do_i_tell_a_function_to_iterate_while_an/
