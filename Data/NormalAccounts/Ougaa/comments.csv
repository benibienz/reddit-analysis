They all are ok for any game, but you want to prioritize auriel if you need blinds or defense vs heavy diving as she has best defense vs both. BW's advantage is teleporting, so she could be go-to on the biggest maps such as garden/cursed, but mostly warhead. Malf is probably the best support if you do NOT need heavy burst healing.

Aba mirror with melee assassin on enemy side, no melee on mine.  
Be squishy without reliable escapes, no support or tank, vs. stealther(s)/divey melee assassins. Game lasts forever because their comp can only kill heroes and not finish games that has been over since loading screen.  

In any game mode:  
End up (in QM) or be forced into picking hero without waveclear or camp taking capability, on map that is all about pve (BHB Morales/Tyrande one of my least favorites).

It doesn't have to be Butcher, just simple stuff like Valla+ETC already do enough AA dmg to justify the talent imo. Any half decent team has few heroes that do mostly AA dmg.

But more importantly you can def go with dmg quest at 1, and self-dmg=energy at 7. Those two go together ofc, but make you rely way less on allies for your energy, and contribute more for team's dmg.

Without a question, Nova/Zag are the best commanders due to possibility for bigger armies. Both are well suited for mission anyway. The extremely fun duo would be Karax+Nova as that's the way for Nova to actually have access for mass units due to chrono waves.

However I don't think Karax is very good for the mission due to infected turkeys instantly wrecking the cannon lines. I mean you lose your 20 cannons in 2sec or something, faster than top panel can clear them when they spawn inside the cannon lines, where trains usually die assuming your ally isn't top notch and killing them before they get there.

4-5hr long run was still bearable, which also included one chance to go to toilet. That's also pretty decent length for a streaming session, assuming no resets. A bit too long but okay!

8hrs was too much. It got tiresome, and you really get pissed being +3min at 5hrs, knowing you might save 5min near the end lol.

Because Zaryas don't really punish them from retreating so they gotta have something to fight for like a keep.

Do not overappreciate mages for clones though. They're not terrible, but quite overrated. Clone is supposed to be able to take risks and get reward for it as it has timed life.

I know it sounds like non-sense, but losing any vikings actually costs you more than enemy team when it takes ages to get back on lane. Butcher did nothing but chased me entire game, which on most maps wouldn't be ideal for him, but it actually made some sense as  I couldn't just do 10s transition from other lane there.

Map doesn't have good bushes to hide on. The area between frontal forts is larger than on other maps, so safe location for soaking behind minions isn't doable if it's 1v1 situation against good gankers.

Objectives are near lanes, every time. There's no edge from vikings getting loads of time to push lanes and soak during them. Locations are too open, so if you just plan to have Erik pick some obvious safest pick, enemy's Zera, Butcher, whoever can just come get easy kill, free nuke and lots of wasted xp for viking player.

If you do manage to get nuke in vikings' hands from some unattended lane, you'll again have to awkwardly decide do you leave that lane unattended and try to backtrack thru backlines to your group to push with it. Because trying to solo thru bushes to their keeps is not a winning strategy and again mostly turns into free nukes to enemy. On most maps I'm not worried about heroes like Nova/Zera at all. But on this map they get more value from hunting vikings than any other ""good"" TLV map just due to there not being safety areas on map.

210,"Blink/Disruptor is pretty fun for one player. But yeah with PP it's pretty standard for one of the players to go full air if going for macro games. Starting with mass nix is such nuisance to enemy when there's double the bases to cover compared to solo. Suddenly minimum 2 turrets needed for 4 bases at 5min, hurts eco. Just one oracle gets ridiculous value too for same reason: assuming all 4 players expand, enemy (who doesn't go for nixes themself) has to play more passive than they'd want due to oracles showing up on any base. So I'd recommend one player to always make early stargate even if doing 1base allins for the double AA def reason alone.

Not starting with nixes is pretty suicidal as PP as they counter kinda everything: mutas, their nixes, libes, mines so well. But I guess if you don't want to go that route, one going twilight into something and other robo into mass robo units has always been common way to build PP. So for example twilight guy goes chargelot+HT while robo guy goes stalker/colo. Beefy army that has counter to everything.

But as the games aren't that refined... can always pull random crap like 2x 4gate too. Or blink allin with other guy going DT-&gt;zlots/adepts. Honestly freestyling random shit can have great value. But my go-to with 1basing would be proxy oracle into both going in with mass gate units. All P units are great for one thing or another in team games, as long as you make sense out of it.

Now if these, imo very good picks, get criticism, why wouldn't Murky? He's not THE BEST for anything, that's the main complaint. Why didn't you pick Zagara? Xul? Sylv? Hammer? TLV? All of them can do what Murky can but with more TF impact (or more pushpower in TLV).

281,"There was post 2 days ago where someone had 42m garden that ended in 30v30 levels. I personally had 49min garden that ended 30v29.

These examples tell a lot: garden has biggest potential for the longest games, and if teams constantly go 90vs90 seeds per night, there may not be structure dmg in ages as terrors sometimes end up just clashing in middle simultaneously.

Reason why my game had less XP gained than the other one I mentioned was due to it being QM azmo v azmo without supports. Neither team wanted to ever fight as both teams appeared better at defending diving. So less pvp, and lots of soaking missed with azmo traits and camps clearing enemy minions without heroes there.

I've heard few other stories of these near 60min gardens. Also curious to hear if anyone has hit lv30 on any other map as it tends to happen on garden by far the most. I believe infernal shrines has the best potential for this, because you never actually kill any forts if you don't push with the boss. Sometimes this happens that the teams just either are too low hp always to push with obj, or are ignorant and just think taking camps is superior to ever killing forts.

No not at all. These just were quite specific examples imo. Right, map too was Tomb for 1), which more often allows the slightly lesser melee presence to work. Not to mention team didn't have very good mosh counters and Jo was banned so taking defensive stance and waiting for them to dive seemed like the better way. Def should've mentioned map as situation probably would look way more dire somewhere like Cursed. On tomb you can get away with never diving in.

On 2nd enemy team pretty much wants you to go in and just AA your face in. From my perspective it feels like fighting their burst dmg with your own burst would be ideal. But even for my eyes it's close, picking something like Tyrael/Diablo instead of heavy dps def sounds OK too. It's just easy to play like enemy wants by picking too Illi focused last pick, when they already have quite decent anti-dive comp.

This all depends on maps though. Sometimes you put a lot of effort in stealing their camps, on ToD I focus on capping all altars, on Sky you try to steal the unattended temples. Quite often I join TF with 1 or 2 vikings, but very rarely all 3. Baleog can push while Erik/Olaf harass in TF. But it's mostly just Olaf eating some AAs and trying to get away without dying, and Erik just doing smallish poke dmg and sometimes chase the low hp guys, but I wouldn't rely on my performance to win TFs. Rather have the focus on your pro hiding, push hard during objs and instead of going back to base, hide in bushes whenever possible as close to minions.

Sometimes you need to TF, and it's nice to play again in situation where you kinda want to do it anyway. Someone ganked Baleog at top lane and team is having 4v4 TF at bottom lane? Erik plays again, so you get the respawn, and can have all vikings fight for a bit, until you can sprint them back to lanes when it seems you won't have big impact in TF anymore. But I don't think there's any situation where TLV should stop laning completely and only move as 7 for rest of the game. When enemy ignores your push, it's desperation if they start hunting your team to force 5v4 fights, and your team's mistake to take those fights.",2016-08-19 17:59:36+00:00,d6obzyi,1.0,t3_4yjvs0,5388,heroesofthestorm

Medivh and Gul'dan have the same problem to me: their skillshot (q) is quite risky to use: specially as Medivh you really don't want to use it if you don't hit heroes, so if you aren't really good at consistently hitting it at max range, you'll prob either miss it a lot, or go too close and get ganked. While he often survives ganks, it still requires taking portals to heal etc. He's just not doing enough consistently as his mistakes cost more than they do for most heroes.

My annoyance about Medivh is that I don't want him to become 50% winrate hero, as the skill differences for Medivh players are so wide. If avg is 50%, there would be lots of good Medivhs doing it at 60%+, possibly more than any other hero. But if his winrate is 45% or less, then I absolutely hate seeing him on my team as there's no guarantee I got one of the good ones - having bad Medivh feels like having half a hero in team.

Let's say you're Illidan. Did you know that in Cursed at 2:00 you should be waiting at your ogre camp so you can clean it up so the ogres can push while first obj spawns, usually around 2:30? After obj, you go to your bruiser camp, again that camp will push during 2nd obj. When one team gets curse, most common thing to happen is they stop pushing midway of the curse and go take their boss. So once you see the possibility that they may be doing their bosses, you should start your boss, so they can't do the typical double boss because it's too late to start yours when they cap theirs. Or go stop their boss is a possibility too I guess.

Above examples are basic stuff that every master player should know. But does gold player have this knowledge? Do they always just keep defending minion waves and bosses if enemy does as I said they should? Probably.

I then played like 5-10 stats, without losing points, because similar to OP's situation I won my demotion match, lost twice, won demotion, lost twice etc. This turned my point situation to receiving negative adjustment points every game from then onwards (maybe 100 games). Now that I made it to GM, the number has actually only increased, and been getting -20 adjustment per game. I imagine I'm at least 500 points too high.

There is no other problem, than the demotion/promotion situation messes up with points a lot and doesn't fix it fast. By losing promotion or winning demotion matches you can easily stay in loop where your MMR changes a lot while points don't. This enables the chance to be +-1000 points away from your real points MMR wise.

491,"What ChaosGandalf said is my guidance too. I'd add a nerd tip: don't be on the open with all of them. Hiding in bushes, just to be on soak range, can be very profitable. Often times there's no chance to actually do structure dmg, so pushing lane can only hurt you as enemy minions start dying at their gates and you staying at soak range makes you automatically die if good gankers show up, say Zera, Tracer, GM, Zag. However hiding in bushes gives you more freedom to look at minimap and micro the vikings that are not hiding. Enemies may catch up with the hiding and start looking thru bushes, but that's only good: adding procedures for them that they otherwise would skip doing, wasting more time hunting vikings when not every bush has Erik in it.

Generally middle lane is the most bushy place. Take maps like ToD or garden, there's constant action and travelers going thru middle even during objectives, you really won't get structure dmg done there even when nobody is opposing on the lane. I usually have Olaf in the middle and he's idling in the bush 50% of the first 10mins. Strongly suggest trying this out if action otherwise seems overwhelming.

Outside Nazeebo's lev1 quest, I think he has some options on talents. Only tiers 1 and 13 seem to be completely locked. But yes as I've understood there are some plans for him already, probably coming in next patch or two.

I don't expect changes to Zera/ETC. Malf has quite one dimensional healing build but he does have few options on most tiers so I don't think he's prio either.

Ones that come to my mind are Morales / Raynor. Specially Ray has like 80% pick rate on any damn talent tier.

2. I personally like pushing forever, and only TF when there's something BIG to fight for, but on many maps there's no such things. Other than you can do is to bring just Olaf and/or Erik and micro them separately, while keep pushing with Baleog. So on GoT you kinda never have to TF except when it's time to finish, and when you control terror. On Sky Temple you also generally have more important things to do: during double temples you should be trying to steal the 2nd temple with 1-2 vikings and soak with rest, so even if team loses 4v5, you may still get ahead from the situation. But on Towers vikings' role is to be there to cap the altars, so you generally don't soak during objs too much, but it's not really TFing either.

This is preference though, there's lots of heroes that people favor instead of Sylv. However Medivh and Chromie are not in the list of heroes people want you to pick for their team.

Medivh simply has the lowest winrate by far. Might be one of the highest skill caps for hero as well. While he's fun, he's not as solid pick as... well 95% of the heroes. He can be fine as some ppl can still get 50% winrate with him in masters+, but you could say the same about any hero in game.

Chromie can be fun too, but when your team doesn't have defense for her, she can just be helpless and useless against bunch of ganky heroes. So she's not good pick as big of the time.

If it's just to spam QM, get whichever you like the most (assuming tried all on their free week(end)s). If going to play unranked or ranked mostly, Sylv would be the best bet.

Proves to me that below pro level preference can make big deal with some talent choices and many of the rarely seen ults can actually be good at times, by certain players.

606,"Moving together as a team. The most basic rotation is the standard way to play Tomb: 1 person is solo bot, and rest of the team moves together between top and mid lanes. For safety, and to gank enemies who don't do the rotations as well. If they just randomly sit/soak 2 at top and 2 at mid, they're bound to get picked off every now and then.

In my eyes smart rotation means overpowering enemy by constantly finding spots where you outnumber them. You suspect there's Illidan soloing their bruiser camp? Go gank him with 2-4 ppl, kill him and steal the camp. Or see that enemy team has 3 guys at bottom side of the map, while you have 3 at the top lane? Sounds like time to kill some free towers. Having good game knowledge helps to know when is the right time to get benefit of small edges.

Reactive Parry  
Templar's Zeal  
Psionic Synergy  
Suppression Pulse  
Phase Bulwark  
Shield Surge  
Force of Will  

Big factor in understanding him is to not spam q/e just because. They are mostly there to save you, or to get kills, not to just do some dmg. Another thing is his trait. Once below 50%, you want to keep eye on when it's on cooldown, and then spam the abilities. So let's say you're 30% health, trait not on cooldown, and you want to start hitting someone. Wait with the 'w' until he hits you, so you can reduce the cooldown of shield by 8/12s instantly, to be closer to next shield. Similarly your q can be used like that to proc the shields more. Just spamming buttons will make you miss many opportunities for more shield procs.  

What counters Artanis is crowd control, stuns. Anything that makes enemies able to hit him, but Artanis not reach them, is counter Artanis. I recently picked Artanis vs. Anub and team said it was bad idea. I learned it was, since I kept getting focused down early when Anub chained his two stuns on me.

For the first set, I don't like the idea of running all the way to either side's ""safe"" ogre camp which would start pushing from behind enemy's fort. It's unlikely that all the 4 ogre camps would be taken every interval in early game anyway, so depending on situation I'd either steal the ogre camp next to either side's mid fort. If you are already soaking close to their gates, might as well steal theirs. If lane is pushed closer to your gates, it's worth considering to just buy your camp and push with it from your gate onwards. No risk of getting caught while running there, no soak wasted. Regardless of what camp you take, they will be pushing some buildings of enemy within 30s, so how much dmg they end up doing depends entirely on reaction time of the enemy.",2016-06-28 23:51:25+00:00,d4rwk7w,1.0,t3_4qbosn,11207,heroesofthestorm
622,"""Wrong"" talents for some heroes/maps.  

Sylvanas/Lunara not picking lev7 pve talents on BoE is beyond me. It's not only great for the dps race, but pushing with immo AND taking the camps in between is a joke with either hero with these talents. Sylvies generally don't mess this up, but too many Lunaras take the stupid +50% basic attack dmg after w talent on maps where pve is way more important. Nature's Culling is pretty much never bad choice, but not taking it on BoE and maybe Tomb is completely ridiculous.  

With TLV not taking bribe on maps with ogre camps like Sky/Garden makes no sense.  

BW taking cleanse OR iceblock is such a terrible idea. You pick the hero for those purposes: giving people shields pre and mid-combat and reducing ability dmg on people. BW shouldn't need iceblock if they take blink ult. If either cleanse or iceblock sound like a good idea, pick another support.  

On the other hand, supports with reasonable cleanse not picking it vs. Xul _AND_ Chromie in same team is absolutely ridiculous. The two probably most necessary times to have cleanse - loop and cage - in same game is pretty much lost without cleanse. One squishy dies every 70s guaranteed, and anyone caged generally dies as well .

&gt; 1) MSC: when? before or after stargate? I usually build: zealot - stargate - MSC. is this correct?  

Sounds OK. I'd consider adepts as first units, off 1-2gates to get some info and maybe few drones, but maybe that's not necessary.


&gt; 2) how many phoenixs? Lately i'm doing 1 to 4 phoenix.  

IMO 3-4 is the worst number. 1-2 sounds like a number you'd make when you want to surprise with huge gate allin and just try to force him to make spores and fake out. If you want to make just 1-2, you would probably be better off making oracle-&gt;VR. This gets you info, few drones for sure, possible defensive use later. VRs will clear at least the close OLs, and more importantly defend against some pressures/allins. But to question how many nixes, I'd make 5+. Picking off any queens is pretty impossible before 5 since iirc 4 would have to lift twice. My number would be 5-7, but never 3-4.  

&gt; 3) Robo or double robo? I go stargate - 2 more gate (3 total) - then double robo - then 3rd nexus. Shall I do first nexus then double robo?

No replays, but your comp has problems if it has issues with ultras. Due to double robo immo spam, ultras shouldn't be made by zerg. Aim at having LOTS of immos, 10+, at your max.

Same goes for ETC. It's not nearly as impactful tank as Rehgar is as healer imo, but if you want to get him, better do it before 2nd bans. Same goes for Jo on some maps where she's imo the superior tank. Jo in general is great if you're afraid your team will be too squishy.

It's already questionable to get those picks as first 2, but it's a no-no to have another ranged squishy added to that. There are enough tanks/supports left for last spots to get something decent even after all picks/bans, but often draft is already lost before last 2 picks. Can muradin+uther really stop the enemy's anub+grey+thrall dive against 3 ranged squishies? It's the 3rd guy's job to take something reasonable in there, be it Thrall, Sonya, tank or healer, up to them.

Difference that few waves of XP is not detrimental, but if they can have Li-Ming blowing up turrets at one lane while Xul pushes another, just staying on soaking range is often unhealthy. If team loses Thrall to go solo soak, they will have much harder time to gank that Xul. Just in general they are supposed to have trouble even soaking vs. your ganks, so it's few levels off if Viking has trouble even Amoving behind his own towers to stay at soaking range.

Also don't pick heroes that you'll then use as an excuse to stay on lanes. Globes? If you think finishing globe quest is important, don't pick Stitches, Leo, Tass for viking comp. Butcher clearly isn't that great pick to begin with, so even more so when you spend half the game laning because ""I need BLOOD!"".  

Xul: he shines as dual laner, but he's not that good solo laner. It's horrible when your team thinks Xul should go straight to bottom on maps like BHB and Tomb. On both maps Xul is first pick first ban material just due to ability to soak 2 lanes alone. Meanwhile he has no chance to beat Zagara for the bottom chest at the beginning on BHB.

697,"&gt; Grubby proves that at most ranks any comp can be viable 

Viable to have fun and win sure. But try harding def has its advantages if main goal is to stay at your highest MMR. Caught mewnfare say this few days ago: he tried tryharding and picking only best heroes at some point and that lead him to 300mmr higher than he currently (and usually?) is. It wasn't made for him so he got back to picking heroes he likes, but it clearly had impact on his MMR.

I don't mind any hero picked in right circumstances for my team. But just deciding before game I'm going to butcher this up is bad strategy and sabotaging team. But from what I've watched a bit, Grubby picks based on situation wisely as you'd expect.

Similarly Erik lev4 heal talent makes more sense than imo standard merclord. Erik is imo best suited to take the bot lane, and harass bottom altar if it goes 4v4 top and Erik vs 1 guy at bot.

TLV shines on map mostly due to vikings' capability to grab all the altars, letting team to fight at enemy's altar. It's not uncommon to get all 3 altars in the first night with TLV comp, when you go straight for their top altar, Olaf grabs your top, and Erik harasses bot until team arrives.

715,"When I played at 2.2k-2.5k mmr, there were so many players that I hardly saw the same people. After 500+ HL games I never felt like I remember someone. Lose 6 games in a row, you may not even be in range to play with the people you played with before. My point is that captain isn't some clearly higher skill player for majority of the games, not enough that they'd deserve any special rights.

It'd also be messed up if the top players would always be 1st picks. Be best player, and be able to pick your best pick (after bans) every game? I don't think that's balanced either. To me what makes the most respectable HL players is the ability to do well with all roles.

I also think some tanks/healers have very high skill caps. I've never seen kharazim who I consider good, except when they're ~3.5k mmr. With Illidan, that's probably the hero I'd want our captain to pick if those fit the compositions well. Also the difference of having actually good Arthas feels much bigger than the difference of your common zags, xuls is.

And one more thing: this way duoQ would be (more) abusable and just by having small difference between the two players would almost guarantee the leader to be from the duo.

Maybe after 100 games you start to see roughly where you're at, but even then hotslogs mmr isn't 100% to be trusted. It's very good indicator, but from my experience it can sometimes be maybe 200p or so off. Usually 200p is healthy amount, I have to win 15-20 games straight to get that much up, so you can't really talk about what your mmr is since you could lose 200p in an hour / 2-3 games.  

Position &amp; getting ganked can be problem in QM just because the setups aren't fair. No tanks or healers in game, you can have hard time as squishy hero.

726,"Surely someone has made a big post about this in the past that's much more depth. How do you know, basically have to know tons about game and all heroes to know their strengths and weaknesses. I'll list few situations.

Li Li: enemy is AA based, has possibly ""divey"" heroes like Illi, Thrall, Greymane. Li Li becomes very good at stopping them right as they come in. My personal view is that Li Li is also great if enemy does NOT have hc healer. Enemy has solo Tyrande, it gives me more allowance to go Li Li and even water dragon ult, because I know I'm still healing more than her. This goes for other situations too, maybe more allowance for more dps talent choices with some supports when playing against half-supports like Tyr. But Li Li won't be good vs. lots of burst, not very good vs lots of ability dmg. Enemy starts with Kael+Li? Not the best Li Li spot.  

Rehgar: the standard option, always good. Main reason imo is his access to burst heal.

BWing: good at slight offense, vs. dive. Basically she's good vs. illidan, but also with illidan (teleport shield, poly illi's target, 'e' illi). But BW is also very good at defending heroes, like Hammer comp is eventually going to get bum rushed if they camp around objective, and being able to stop that raging Thrall with poly, and maybe emerald dream can be huge. BW, like kharazim, also work well when your team is going to stay together a lot since most of their heals come to anyone right around you. While BW doesn't have burst heal, she's great at making the situation never happen. Khara on the other hand has great burst with palm ult, so he sees the dmg done but can save it with heals, while BW mostly relies in not having it happen.  

Malf is good when enemy team has lots of sustained dmg but not as much burst. Enemy team has Zag+Naz? I'd see malf as good option. Since he relies on over time healing, he can dominate healing charts sometimes, but if people just drop like flies instantly, he won't be much use.  

Tassadar and Tyrande are both very good for double support situations, most of the time with each other. With tass you often would want *some* heals but not a full healer like Rehgar, while Tyrande's healing can sometimes be very lackluster but she can bring tons of dmg with decent amount of other support (vision, mark). Tyrande dmg build basically can fit all comps, since she's more like assassin then than support. On other times if your team relies on erasing people with stun locks, solo tyrande can be viable too. But picking Tyrande for game where you expect long team fights isn't the best idea. Tassadar can also work with many other supports, like serpent build LiLi. Some pros have said they expect Tass to be the one that gets paired with Medivh in the future too.  

Morales is ""the healbot"". I'm not the biggest fan of her. I guess her weakness is that she doesn't have good selfheals so sometimes she just gets killed very fast. On the other hand she's very good at keeping other priority targets alive, if again she has the support. I've seen her being picked often in Hammer comps where she'll no doubt not be the 1st target. If you ever think of Morales, make sure there are good stim drone targets, so AA heroes like Raynor, Valla etc. in team to get most out of it.  

I'd prob lie more than I already have if I said anything about Uther. He's generally considered harder to master, but he's pretty good all around one too similar to Rehgar I guess. His popularity for big parts revolves around his dshield ult, which can be great to make your key targets unstoppable, so ETC doing mosh, greymane diving etc.",2016-06-02 01:51:38+00:00,d3skbh3,2.0,t1_d3sglqa,5855,heroesofthestorm

Would you generally go for some anti-stealth talents in these cases, like Far Sight? I dislike the idea of solo tass specially without frontline other than one tank but don't know of much better options.

2) Hardened focus. Many heroes have this, but it's not the most common pick by any I've seen. Why is this? I feel like I barely start healing as Malf at 16 due to it. I even considered it could be decent with Naz for more ability spam, but hotslogs data really didn't approve my thoughts with winrates.

Taking mana reduce on heal at lev4 makes me very rarely go oom in TFs.

Tracer ban is just similar to others like Illidan, ETC or even Morales to some extent. Those heroes will change the way game is played a lot, forcing many counterpicks.

805,"Hovering around r1-5 2.5k mmr. My experience is that 1st team often decides the bans. If they ban tracer, 2nd team usually ""throwbans"" aka. bans just some strong hero like Fals, Zag, whatever, as long as the first two picks of the 2nd team are willing to play both Li and Kael. Come to think of it, Thrall might be the best first ban so you won't end up on those situations with 4 squishies+tank vs. tank+thrall+3squishies which generally is unfavorable comp.

Whenever I'm leader, 2nd round ban just so often ends up being ETC. I personally favor heroes that aren't great at mosh countering, so most of the time our early picks would have issue with him. Illidan is another one I'd consider for 2nd bans often, if our first picks would have issues with lots of diving. And also against early illidan I'd ban specific illi supporters like Aba, Tass, BW. Or if my team has Illi, I might even ban Li Li. But these are mostly Illidan based situations, so my 2nd bans generally are 80% ETC, 10% Rehgar.

On 1st ban I like banning Tracer still assuming I'm 1st ban, or enemy didn't ban Li/KT. She's just too annoying to deal with for half of the heroes and in good hands often gives too big lead for their team.

829,"I've used Water Dragon a lot - always if double support, and often as solo support vs. specific setups. Let's face it: LiLi's heal ult is terrible. Not being able to spam buttons during it sucks, and being easily interrupted does too. Sometimes you just can't survive without it, specially against lots of aoe dmg like KT. But when enemy team relies a lot on diving, and has heroes like Illi or Thrall, Water Dragon can sometimes ""outheal"" Jugs by reducing your team's dmg taken. So best defense is sometimes having the best offense! But picking it generally comes down to how easily accessible stuns they have. ETC/Diablo for example have too easy stuns available so I generally go Dragon vs both. Dragon's benefits are just so many: cheaper cost in longish fights makes it available sometimes when Jugs would just be too much. It's boom, dead hero if you ever see solo heroes roaming around in Dragon's range, while you have anybody in your team with you. In TF aoe slow sometimes hits 2-3 heroes, making them require tons of healing and also have them not hit you, sometimes reducing the healing necessary by as much as Jugs would've provided. And the cooldown is so short that you often get it many times in same fight, even before Hustle @lv20.

Malf's Twilight Dream is a bit harder sell, since compared to Li Li his heal ult isn't interruptible, and has potential to heal more. Also casting it sometimes forces Malf to go in risky spots to get big impact. I've seen it used few times to decent success though, but I'm a bit undecided on it. Maybe more of a double support thing, while Li Li can do hers solo in otherwise same comps?

Stagedive I've seen used once for good success on ToD. Team had Deha+Fals+ETC so they kept rocking it when there were multiple altars popping.

842,"I'm biased since I've played thousands of games with all races. But answering as toss.

Easiest thing as toss is that generally timings on your tech hasn't been as necessarily timed. If you're going for macro game with 3+ bases, you can get there in several ways, usually all tech trees being available. I'm talking historically, I've never cared about exact BOs like ""5:45 robobay 6:25 twilight"" etc. but I haven't suffered from it as much as other races would.

So, hardest thing as terran is the opposite of that. Terran has always relied more on timings, everything lining up perfectly. Something always lacks on my carefree playing, be it +1/+1, stim, right amount of medivacs etc.

As zerg hardest thing by far used to be finding that damn probe. Big reason why I never cared about playing z was that I knew I'd have to rally 4 lings different paths every game to find unit that might singlehandedly kill me with some 2base timing attack. Now it's a bit shame that the hardest thing about ZvP no longer is in the game :P So to simplify: imo hardest thing about zerg is their weakness to early timing attacks if you are keen on playing eco.

I allow Rexxar to be hard, but he's def not very hard. I actually feel he's sometimes quite low apm intensive, when you charge with misha, and then wait a second before throwing the eagle.

Artanis is imo fine. I understand what you say, but I don't feel like he's still really hard. You can do 'ok' with him by just spamming buttons (not caring about trait not being on cd mainly). Whenever hero is easy to play to OK level, I won't rate them over medium.

920,"Thanks for wide answers. Which only gave me more questions! :)

How would you alter ranged based symbiote build then? If you can't rely on heavy melee presence, I can only assume lev 1 mines, lev 13 extra stab and lev 16 ...uh, Volatile Mutation? :D But that's probably only IF gone for Monstrosity so maybe next patch? Since what I'm assuming sounds a bit foolish, I guess you'd go 13/16 locusts in those scenarios where you didn't get lev 1 spikes?

OK so let's say I did go for locusts. I feel like my way is so clumsy: z'ing to middle of nowhere (to lane), using 1&amp;2, hearthstoning out. This takes so big portion of my time. How often is it sensible to hearthstone out and when to do other trickery, like using ulti from risky spot and hoping there's nobody around when it ends, then re-evaluate if you can afford to stay there another ~20sec or z to other lane? Mainly curious about how often you hearthstone out after only being there for 1&amp;2, and how often staying around to not waste time on hearthstoning/teleporting.

And another thing is the dual lane soak, or not? So when my team is 4v5'ing at objective, I bodysoak distant lane and then symbiote my team, right? That's what I've been doing, but should I sometimes try to soak another lane with symbiote instead of helping my team?",2016-03-31 07:02:49+00:00,d1k5z1t,4.0,t1_d1k55qt,2435,heroesofthestorm

I've had a lot better success with symbiote build (assuming team has 2+ melee), when I feel I'm making difference in team fights from early level.

So question is how would you rate full symbiote build vs. full locust/mine build in setups with 2+ melee heroes. Does symbiote ever come on top, and if not, how big winrate difference do you have at your level with either style?

923,"Okay, weekly bunch of questions coming up! Rank 2 currently, but forever curious!

1) Is there counterplay for **Divine Palm**? Whether it's monk casting it too early to let you react to it, or you know the enemy is so good he won't miss it, is there proper reaction to it? Do people ever stop attacking someone at 10% when they know opposing Khara has it available, expecting to bait him to use it and then ignore them? I guess this mostly is about pro level, since HL even at higher level probably doesn't have that kind of coordination.

2) **Lunara**: is there situations when thornwood is the false option to take? Are there heroes that you NEED leaping strike against always? I personally can think of Leoric, is it considered must against prison? What other heroes is it picked against?

3) Li-Ming: **Wave of Force**. I've only once picked this in HL, when team had no other stuns available vs ETC. Is it considered norm to pick it in that situation? Again same question: are there other situations where Li-Ming ""has"" to take WoF over standard lazor?

4) Muradin jump (**Dwarf Toss**). This is just to make sure I'm sane. I've seen many muradins even at ~rank5 or so who always INITIATE fights by jumping into them. To chase solo overextended targets I'd get it, but wouldn't mounting in be always advised way to do it if possible? From my POV they lose mana and the have spell on cd when it's time to chase or escape, all for nothing.

5) What's the punishment when people get reported for other reasons than abusive chat? I assume silence only comes from chat reports? Most common thing I report people for after chat is AFK/nonparticipation by rage feeders. Hopefully it's not just longer silences?

6) Game says every rank in HL represent 2% of the playerpool. **Is rank1 really just 2%**? I assume not, since it looks like close to 15k of the 105k accounts in EU HL are in rank1 range. How big proportion of people actually are in rank1?

7) **Does Li Li's blind have more than two priorities**? I mostly mean summons by heroes, do they get blinded more likely than minions and less likely than heroes, or are they at same priority level as minions?

941,"""It depends"". Have to make decision whether you think you can still get into macrogame after busting out, or too far behind (likely) and just have to go with whatever you got. In latter case obv never go over the small probe count, which probably is way less than 44 because you've mined out at least some parts of your base already. I think it's pretty desperate to have chance in those situations, assuming it wasn't like 12/12 zergling flood and you think he might still be below your drones at 5mins. I guess the best chance is to have prism harassing their eco while holding off and trying to bust out. There's usually no way to win either macro or allin though if it's like zerg who had 3hatchery before doing the attack and managed to keep you sealed to your 2base for minutes after destroying/cancelling your 3rd.

But yeah if it's something like hard 1base allin in pvp from opponent who kills your nexus and you sit on 1base, I assume you should end up having more than 1base eco probes anyway, like 24+ at least. No point making probes before having chance to put nexus again right? I imagine making probes then is only good if you know it's very light contain while enemy is expanding and warping units home against your possible oracle/prism/dt. Then I might add few probes while warping units, just so I'd be closer to full saturation at nat when I finally get the chance to do nexus.

Long story short, only make probes if you're confident you CAN expand soon, within 2 minutes, and if you think game can still be somewhat even. Otherwise I'd just cut probes and put everything on your allin since you don't want to play those 60 v 100pop games that we sometimes see even at pro level when inevitable loser doesn't want to quit due to not knowing exactly how far behind they are.",2016-03-28 04:28:24+00:00,d1g0l0x,1.0,t3_4c7uiu,16305,allthingsprotoss

I see 10x same rank people in my game from soloqueue, there's no way their blizz MMR is very far from each other, somehow hotslogs manages to put some of them 400 higher than others. I get that MMR is good tool to differentiate people past rank1, but before then I should absolutely not care about it right?

3. Another hotslogs related question. How damn wide is rank1? Since according to hotslogs best players are at 4500 MMR, and you can already achieve rank1 at 2700 or so MMR, how many games in a row could #1 ranked player lose before they dropped to rank2? Is this number 3digit?

4. OK actual noob question here: what does the garden terror ""superglobe"" give. It looks different, and since it's dropped by garden terror I assume it gives some extra health but what are its values exactly?

1030,"Depends on the matchup. Stargate and mass nix are quite favorable for toss teams, so unless you do super fast attack, odds are opposing toss team can wreck you with their mass nix if you didn't go for them. So I feel like you can't really bank on going muta as PZ when mass nix is so common. Bread and butter needs to be roach based midgame just because it'd make no sense to make mutas if you do nix, and similarly if opponent made them. Always scout and react to switch early enough from your tech if they're indeed doing air.

If they aren't toss and aren't going sg, then just macro lingmuta with toss going more beefy ground army can work. Be it some 2robo immortal (or colo or disr) with heavy gate unit comp, maybe storm instead of 2robo etc. Typical 1v1 type of comp. Or if you take control of air, then ally has to play roach based (lurker/hydra/ravager/viper etc) because muta+nix comp doesn't work together.

Don't bother with feeding resources, it's not needed and it's actually pretty lame to do since you can't expect enemies to do it when you mostly face against random teams.

Expanding should not be a problem. 2v2 maps are very macro friendly and toss can get away with &lt;2min exp every time. I've only vetoed one map from 2v2 pool, I think its name was Omicron or smth. It doesn't have easy to take nat for both players so it can be bad for toss (or terran). All the rest are fine, specially since you don't have to worry about getting ling flooded, your team having the zerg to deal with that.

Generally maps have obvious place for both players to expand. There are some exceptions though, and in those cases toss should get the safer exp, while zerg takes the further away one. Z has the capability to make spores without extra tech to counter stuff like dt, minedrops, oracles etc., same for spines if you suspect big attacks while you want to macro. Toss rather takes the safe exp which is usually closer to his main, so he can ward both bases with same MSC kinda.",2016-03-06 15:46:40+00:00,d0pnpi1,1.0,t3_48u63d,237786,allthingsprotoss

If you are not pro, this should be everyone's mindset (to some extent) with games that force you to lose 50% of your games. Even at rank1, most players stay at &lt;55% winrate. There's just no point getting mad on *HALF* of your games.

It's not in your control beyond playing your best and trying to coordinate team around, it just seems childish to make problem out of nothing.

1043,"Okay, bunch of questions I kept in from last couple of days!

1. On cursed hollow, when your team gets the curse (edit: enemy gets curseD), my teams (soloQ QM) almost always start pinging to get the boss. Is this not terrible waste of the curse, to just get ""free"" boss but most likely not get any keeps during it when getting to boss, killing it and moving out generally makes the curse go away, and their few members have been able to defend it. I haven't started to argue this too much since I could be wrong, but is getting the boss there a mistake or... even a standard that I don't understand?  

2. Maps with ""the eye"" for vision. Am I correct to think right play is to gather there once the gates open? Sky Temple basically all there, or Blackheart's Bay 4 top eye while 1 (specialist usually) goes to bottom. Quite rarely I see people understanding the importance of the eye when it's the only thing worth fighting for before first waves(/chests). So to just clarify: am I in the right here and should I push allies to come with me more often?  

3. vs. AI. Why do people play this, like actually tons? I commonly check profiles of the people I felt played very well or very bad out of curiosity. But statistics often say they have 1200 wins out of their 1600 games. I was wtf'd for a long time about this, since I've been exactly 50% for all my ~600 games until I learned so many have 500+ games (with ~99% winrate) played vs. AI. What's the motive, and why do even ""high"" ranked people do that? Is it just XP grinding? Do you even get the same XP vs AI. than vs humans?  

4. This probably warrants its own topic, and must have been talked over a lot. But can someone ELI5 the ranking system in HL? Recently started playing HL and made it to around rank20. Sounds fair, being a beginner and games seemed fair too, all players rank20 and often I didn't feel like anyone was way superior or worse than me. But then in QM I come across people who I feel are really bad, someone who'd get shouted at furiously by everyone on my HL games, only to learn they're something like rank5. So my question is: how much do the initial placements decide? Can you get stuck on ""wrong"" mmr? What if rank1 player was given rank30 account with 8-12 placements. How long would it take him to climb that account to rank1? Or is there a chance he'd get stuck somewhere lower, and if so how low? What's the range of ranks that someone could get stuck on, if their top range is rank1?

1084,"If they hide the first pylon and cannon in close enough proximity, it's often over right then if they can just make the 2nd cannon in position where it forces action (range of nexus, minline or even gate). I've always considered hidden cannon to be the cheapest way to win in game, and it has been viable way to get to masters+ since WoL.

Haven't come across that in a while, but what's been more common is them starting 3 pylons behind your minline, and keeping room to start one or two cannons there. I think if that's well done, on maps where you can do that, you generally lose as well if you allow all the 3 pylons to start. But chronoing lot out and hitching thru pylons with as many probes you can sometimes wins it.

In the hidden case, I can't say other than try to get 2 stalkers out at a time from 2gates, chronoing them and hoping you could overcome cannons before you lose all your mining and nexus. But I don't know the cannon vs stalker math in lotv, if it's even possible :/ Evacuation indeed tends to put you too far behind. I imagine Ulrena evacuation could hold better chance if you already have probe on the map that can start the nexus at gold asap.

But watching replay... WALL! I assumed it was issue about defending 3rd, but you had no wall at either main ramp or natural's. On Prion it's good idea to just make first pylon and gateway/core at the natural's ramp. It's odd ramp so I suggest to prac it on custom game to see how you'd set up buildings. But it's easy to hold your 2 bases by just having 2 units at the natural's ramp, zlot/adept/sentries. Same goes for every other map, you always want to have wall somewhere so lings can't freely run between all the bases. Pylon behind and gate+core wall to leave space for a unit to block it is easy standard on normal ramps, on this map you'd need pylon as part of the wall too.

1091,"1) Definitely the best for Prion. On orbital/dusk this obv wouldn't even hurt terran for other than losing reactor and maybe 2 supplies, but no scv lost mining time. Other maps not sure. It could work on any map to make terran go wtf and over/under react to it. Worth trying out.

2) pylons started at 3:00. Straight reactor without reaper would be ready around 2:05. Marine buildtime 18s. He'd have 6 ready when pylons start. I don't think this could work against non-reaper actually. So kinda metabuild, considering reaper is very hard to kill on that map he probably ~knew he'd face reaper.

3) If you just have to cancel the plans and not even get pylons up, lose probe maybe, I don't think that's still game lost at all. You really can't even call that nexus delayed, it was almost as fast as you could get. Correction to build is that he made 19nex 19pylon, so he def cuts a probe or two there to get pylon up to start both msc/adept at once. But that's most of his eco loss.

4) nixes are always solid idea. I've been on the losing side when terran sneaks either medic with few marines/mines or liberators to that airspace, and it's horrible to defend them without sg imo. Also stargate is better if you know it's 1rax into factory, than if it's 3rax. Nixes do well vs. mines/medics/libes/cyclone/tanks, and oracle can also work decent since he probably isn't going to invest in ebay as early with that opening (and considering what he lost).

1092,"Absolutely take use of adepts. Blink/immo to wreck tank camps is rarely the best idea, need something to soak the hits.

You could win 6tank+6helbats with seemingly small number, say 10 adepts if they shaded in there perfectly. Then immos walking to clean it up simultaneously.

Game was lost upon losing natural, but if that hadn't happened suggested thing is to get storm since it's good against all their units. Keep track of his army and disrupt him if he tries to just walk on your doorstep and siege it. Obs at his nat tells when he moves out, so you can start slowing him down even if you don't have the army to fight it.

In general I'd play greedier vs mech than bio, since there won't be constant chance of big stim attacks or 2medic drops to any of your bases. So taking faster 3rd and 4th is advised, just so you can mass them out. 2robo immos was good idea, that's one thing I'd keep about what you did. Even if you open blink, that doesn't mean you need to actually make any stalkers specially if you see early tank which I think obs saw.

Just early robo is generally good against anything they can pull on 1base. After dealing with reaper, first adept should go hang near his base so you know if he's about to move out. Shading as far as you can to see what he got. Weirdly terrans think it's great idea to make fac/sp in vision range for adept to see, I'd be much more worried if I saw nothing since it could be fast 3rd cc, 3rax or fac/sp.

PvP 2gas 2gate pre exp means... well not much, that's the standard to go for since 1base allins should beat everything else. Open like that yourself and add sg or robo before expanding if it looks like opponent might make it into 1b allin. I prefer just 2 stalkers at a time, be it defense or offense.

PvZ there's not very reliable ways to know what Z is up to with their gas. Gate scout to see if it's pool first, otherwise can skip zlot.

So kinda like mech in TvP now: nobody plays against it so unit compositions are less known. Basis of carriers hasn't changed, they're still slow to build, become better the more you have them thus making games into turtlefest.

At the highest level PURE air from start to finish can only be a thing in PvP where both open stargate, because even if they transition to blink/archon, you've been able to build air forces long enough to stand a chance. In every other scenario, where air player doesn't get huge lead from the start, opponent knows what to do and how to kill them before toss gets their ultimate maxed army. I've won few GMs with pure air and it's not fun, really just 20min camp and then win because opponent didn't know the proper composition, hell I don't know either. You see their cluelessness from how your composition never changes, but they keep going from corruptor+viper to infestor+queen to sporewalls.

Your eventual probepull wouldn't work when he can just back off to one finished bunker. With it he'll eventually get another bunker in range of nexus since your stalkers alone aren't enough to stop it. It's always debatable who wins the probepull+few stalkers vs mass marine situations, but that shouldn't become issue when he has something to back off to.

edit: checked last patch replay, and enemy already started 2 bunkers at top of the ramp at 1:52. Sure he was just making first marines, but he'd still have 3 out before any of your units come out. To stop those bunkers from coming up you'd first need vision of it happening, and then pull 10 probes minimum. You'd lose some of them for sure and lose so much mining time that eventual defending becomes the issue when you can't actually afford both MSC and adept if you pulled the probes, and adding gates is also tough. He ofc doesn't need 2 bunkers generally, I just used spotter pylon at ramp so he knew I knew, thus two was needed.

It's worthy idea to do core pre-nexus sure with the amount of proxy reapers as well. What I most dislike about even slightly delayed nexus is the scvs starting to block it more and more now. I think that ~1:20 to 1:32 nexus timing is quite big difference when it comes to scout timing. But that should be OK. Also I'm not sure I want to be making stalker straight after adept blind, but that could be similar to zlot start-canceling.

Anyway I'm not convinced opponent played this well enough to say you can defend it unscouted. Also 4x 15rax doesn't sound the right way to do it.

MSC should just stay at natural and have enough pylons around so they can't load without getting gunned by two. One cannon to accompany should be good. But this is for the part where you have to def 3 bases. There's no excuse to stay home on two bases at 6min and not be prepared for all the drops. If you're not going to go heavy offense, should always have faster blink or phoenix capability to shut this stuff down. But having like 4 pylon wrap around bottom right of natural, with maybe few adept warps to support pylons should work wonders. MSC can't def two bases at once anymore so just commit it to one place.

Some may disagree, but I don't recommend patrolling with observers. The one at the left would've missed medics flying at the top over half the time. Just place it where it's most needed, which in that case would be to barely spot the top of the map. I've rarely seen many drops to come from the left there though, since the main army that you should have at your 3rd is usually capable of dealing with it without too much losses.

But I've seen strong 1b allins that go to any of the tech: twi/sg/robo. Pure stalkers may still lose vs. robo and dt allins. Robo/shrine builds generally have to start with 2 adepts though, so maybe add &lt;3:30 robo vs adept players and just keep gates vs stalker openers.

Fangames, namely I wanna kill the kamilia 2/3 are also games I'd love to be able to do runs of. I don't enjoy grinding bosses on those games to even beat the games casually though, so that'll never happen.

Boshy I used to run for a bit, but before getting gud I stopped because I didn't think I'd become much of a masher.

Kinda qualifies for quitting because too hard I guess.

I'm full run kind of guy so thought I would learn the strats and do a run. But I got demotivated by difficulties to make some of the strats consistent. Decided I'd only do a run if I thought I could make it good, not a single mission where I'd lose 3mins+. That didn't seem easily doable so didn't end up doing runs at all (yet).

Conclusion: armor is better AS LONG AS your opponent gets no upgrades. Otherwise dmg is better due to its lower price. Between good players, you're going to assume opponent gets an upgrade when he goes to 3sg nix imo. Delaying upgrades altogether can be fine I guess, but getting +1dmg serves two purposes: keep up with enemy who either wants to go to 2/0 or 0/1, and is first step in getting to 2/0 which allows your shots to go to 8 against enemy who went for 1/1, or have you ahead in eco if he went 0/2 (which I've never seen anyone do anyway).

1243,"I'll give casual view on few of your topics:

&gt;  it was probably hard to tell who was in the lead. 

Even if I've completed the game casually, my only pointer on who was in lead was to check the ""19/22"" marker at the top of each players' screens at end of the levels. I actually mistook wobs to be in lead mid-run. 99% of the audience could probably make the same mistake.

&gt; The race format doesn't work well for Cloudbuilt in a marathon setting

This may be true, but I'd expand that any new game doesn't do as well as it could when race is its first entrance to big marathon. Actually races rarely are very memorable unless there's either pro (couch) commentary or the finish is super close. Or the banter is something super entertaining. Specially run this short, there's no time to waste on comparing runners' results. This guy is in the lead, oh this guy made a blunder. There's enough tech to be explained for the duration of the run, specially when dev will take part of the time. I'd compare this to HLM1 runs on GDQs. First time it was duke running it alone, and it was taken very well. 2nd time it was race between cfb and duke, and it was totally forgotten and nobody mentioned it. Now it was solo again, and it was taken pretty well again. Those runs rely a lot on humor, but it's the same idea: one guy doing a short run can make viewer understand more of the run, which this game was in need of.

&gt; the couch guy who was there was dead silent, although maybe I missed him talking. Another dangerous thing was that there was actually too much developer commentary.

I think it's odd to say dev talks too much and couch doesn't. Not everyone need to talk if rest can keep up the conversation. Dev sounded like he was kinda into speedrunning himself, and even taken that into consideration while making the game. To me that's the best kind of dev - someone who isn't just 'oh wow'ing but actually knows his shit. I know that's the common synergy where dev actually doesn't know anything and that's part of the entertainment to have them being woo'ed, but I really can't hold it against them to keep talking about the game they're clearly very enthusiastic for. I do agree though that speedtech of the game was ignored a bit, just don't know if this can be blamed on couch alone. Unless of course it was decided that they'll talk about this and that specifically. There's no easy key points in the game to start talking about 20s before they happen like most games, so it's hard to know when to intervene as couch if it's not planned beforehand. I don't know of their preparations, but even as a runner I'd have wanted to do one prac run WITH couch commentating to see how it really goes. I could see myself being silent as well if there's no some obvious times to explain this and that.

A bit off-topic, but were there other categories submitted and were they declined? Something that combines more levels in, either all non-defiance levels, or maybe even them if they're marathon safe. Because this was a bit too short and sweet for a game that is so well suited for speedrunning. Defiance levels specially can look a lot cooler when done fast closer to intended ways, for even casual viewers to understand this looks hard.

Dev/runners were chill. Well midboss didn't really talk. I imagine commentary can always work the best if it's done as conversation, but that worked fine between wobs and dev.

Dunno if I missed it, but you could've hyped about the movements maybe a bit.

If you aren't going to go prism harass or some other allin, should always start stargate or blink, to defend the factory openings. Either one is good against minedrop, cyclone and libe, the most usual ones. Phoenixes obv the factory counter.

Again, for now, always have adepts tanking the army. Plain blink/colo is really weak and shouldn't win pvt anymore.

Use the observer better. There's no much use of it idling one screen ahead of your army since it doesn't spot drops or main army moving until it may be too late. Somewhere in front of his 3rd is generally good spot for your ""offensive"" obs to observe his army comp/size/moveout timing. Ofc with 2 robo you could have 3+ obs around easily.

But main thing is army comp being too weak. Just stalker/immo is better than stalker/colo actually for same army worth. For now adepts are important, maybe in next patch chargelots make comeback dno.

Good run would want to use as close to IL strat as possible, but it's really hard to decide how much slower version of a IL strat you'd do. There's levels with hard 5min strat, or easy 10min strat. Damn, doesn't sound like speedrun to do the 10min version, but losing 5min failing the hard strat is also so likely. This kind of crap goes on for half of the missions.

You basically need 100+ hrs of practice before doing the first run, if you want it to be any decent. Generally grinding playthroughs of game is good practice, but RTS speedruns feel a lot more like series of ILs where every mistake can cost minutes.

This way if they do get to lots of libes, your ground army tends to wreck him so fast that you can somewhat freely snipe libes one by one with either leftover nixes or blink/archon/storm depending on the game. I don't do big harass early on really, but if you don't then you ofc want fast 3rd at minimum.

1289,"&gt; rather than seeing a weird 200 mineral warp prism that you may or may not know is committed or not.

This ofc could be fixed by giving prism different outlook upon completing the upgrade, if it was considered unfair to not know.

&gt; Many protoss strategies involve teching to Robotics bay, so it is only a relatively cheap 100/100 upgrade assuming you like to use disruptors, which you probably do if you are going to utilize a warp prism anyway.

You can get to decently high level without ever making disruptors, while you still need prism in basically every game. Having this important upg on robobay would kinda force you down the disruptor path, since it'd cost 300/300 without other use of bay. Robobay also already has very good upg for prism, it wouldn't really be balanced if prism remained vital part of every toss army while two great upgrades were under bay. I don't mind the price, even if it was higher, but it shouldn't be in building that forces your tech path so dramatically.

&gt; yes, 2 base allins will be weaker, and maybe even 3 base. But that is intentional.

I think it leads to worse game, if there's no threat of toss moving out on big attack all of a sudden. Stale situations where toss move out is known minutes before it can happen. If at 5min terran was to scout robo half-way, does he know he's basically safe for next 3+ mins?

I'm painting dire ramifications, but I do think prism fast warp is something you can't hide behind tech tree that forces your playstyle that much. You could say why it'd be bad to be under cybercore? ~150/150 and whatever time needed there, it would make some sense (warpgate research and warp time speedup similar enough) and it wouldn't make you incapable of attacking with builds that don't rush robobay.",2015-12-22 19:56:28+00:00,cy8450o,3.0,t1_cy82oqg,2092,starcraft

For zvp it makes banes not work vs. adept allins, and improves lurkers/towers vs. adepts. Not too big effects.

In pvp this would make adepts much worse. It's already debatable should you go 2 adepts or 2 stalkers to start off. Many like adepts better since on top of few worker kills and delayed mining, they can scout tech. But I imagine 2 stalkers defending the adepts will kill them a lot faster now. Adepts also would work worse when doing big midgame attacks as meatshields. I think adept would kinda die from pvp with this change.

It's worth testing, but I'm a bit worried about PvT lategame with this. If adepts still remained decent tanks (for ranged), it might also kinda remove marines from terran armies.

He makes turrets vs blink allin, does thors vs roach maxes, doesn't prepare for oracle from unscouted random=toss etc. Same as anyone else.

I've complained about ally few times when it's apparent they shouldn't search brutal or even hard - if I played at their level, we'd probably not pass normal.

Instead of gate walls, what you want to do is NEXUS walls with shield batteries behind them. You want to ignore the mission objective of course, and not necessarily make any units. I made like 30 immortals myself, but I don't think you actually need to make ANY units to pass this achivement, if you play otherwise right.

Other than the wall, you want to spam the new towers all around. I suggest to have nexuscannon to allow it to tank the top right, and to ofc do some dmg as well. I personally had 1 nexus at top right, 2 at bottom right, 2 at top left and 3 at bottom left. At least 3 shieldbatteries in range of each nexus. After that it's just massing big cannons.

Solar lance is very good for dealing with the infinite bling/ultra waves. Those waves come from 3 sides at once, so if you time it right, instead of losing nexus at each side, you can snipe all banes done with well placed lances. That alone prob boosts you by 0.1B.

My shot shows how I actually had plenty resources in the end left. This is because my base was full of buildings, no room to build anywhere. After that you get eaten out from outside, where you can't actually build anything anymore due to being blocked out (and because mobs are still around).

So, in your case what is there to know? They know what game SMG is, and they can check your pb time to know if you're half-decent at the game. Then they think, should SMG maybe be in the marathon?

I like it this way because drawings are always interesting and can cause funny moments/interviews around them. Also the fact that sometimes you can gain benefit from finishing 2nd because opposing group's 2nd place is greatly superior player on paper to the 1st, thus making player motivated to only place 2nd to avoid them.

Totally game dependant for sure, some games have really solid all around content making 100% good option. But then it comes down to other mentioned issue, time. Long runs have two problems: they take long to do, and are harder to learn.

1559,"I'd easily see &lt;10apm wins with proxy gate if you think out all the needed actions. You select one probe, move it towards opponent's base, select nexus, make 3 probes. 6 actions? Pick probe again, start pylon. 8? Build 1 gate. Select gate. Set rallypoint to minline. Build lots, 1+. Your apm should lower the more lots you make, since you really only make 1 action per 38 ingame seconds. I count total of 12 actions that far.

Obviously to win with non-chronoed 1-3 lots from 1 gate you need lower level opponent, but with few added clicks I'd see wins vs dia+ opponents happening easily if you added that 2nd gate. Actually single 7gate should work too, to reduce one action - maybe even 6gate. I'd imagine 4-5 apm wins happening quite easily at tin leagues.

Ofc 6pool should be the lowest since it's just select drone, pool, select 3 larva, zzz, rally. 6 lings def win games sometimes alone, or opponent just leaves. 7 actions minimum.

Unfortunately terran probably needs to have high requirement of 10+ apm for proxy raxes. Also more scvs are likely needed than probes/drones since you prob rather pull the existing scvs than keep making more marines.
