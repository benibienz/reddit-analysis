1) How detrimental is it to complete his trait quest? In QM non-support games you die a lot more, and without Abattoir I don't seem to get the quest completed in games where we lose. Is it more important to complete it than some other ""failable"" quests, such as Kael's flamestrike quest or Medivh's Q quest?  

2) Who are the heroes that Butcher *cannot* duel? Most heroes seem to fall hard in fair 1v1, even without ults, but I'm quite uncertain about bruisers and some melee assassins.  

3) Matchup vs. Illidan. I've died few times now trying to challenge Illidan, who just seems to wait until I brand him before he pops evasion. Are you even supposed to win vs. Illidan or should you try to focus everyone else before getting to him?  

4) Who are his hardcounters? Blinds seem obvious, so Li Li, Auriel, Jo, Artanis maybe? But against who else should you reconsider about picking him?  

5) Lamb to Slaughter seems like the more standard ult pick. When would you consider it better to go with Furnace Blast?

EDIT: 6) How fast should the quest get completed? Should it be done by lev13? Later? Is there some goal in what time you *SHOULD* be able to get it with proper soaking?",heroesofthestorm,Questions about The Butcher,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/56vegm/questions_about_the_butcher/

So examples:  

1) Artanis+Medivh+Rehgar+Tracer+**me** vs. Leo+ETC+GM+Auriel+Ming.  

2) Sonya+Illi+Tass+Rehgar+**me** vs. Tychus+Mura+Thrall+Valla+Uther  

I don't want to pick warrior on either situation, should I? In first I think Medivh sort of upgrades Artanis' tankability to annoying enough level that you'd be better off picking Tychus. On second I feel like Illi with 2 warrior 2 support just isn't ideal, and 2supp keeps Illi+Sonya alive well enough that you should be picking some heavy ranged dps such as Ming.

As these scenarios aren't common enough, I don't know how others treat them. My thoughts super standard or would some pick warriors on either situation or even both?

edit: I feel like both time my choice in these situations was caused by Tychus: first time he semi counters their diving needs. On 2nd situation enemy's Tychus already has decent targets and his own meat to hide behind - taking another warrior could potentially just give him more strength when your team lacks dps even more.

I should say that when I've seen these scenarios occur, on either side I am, the team that has gone solo bruiser in these situations has won, and each time I've suspected it might happen when game starts. Not quite wood league situation either but master. I think people don't value all the given data well enough: existence of Tychus and Medivh are the keyfactors why the situation even arises where not autolocking warrior would even be an option.

This ofc needs completed lev1 quest, and lev16 talent to boost the dmg greatly.  

I don't know if this could ever become consistent sight even if perfected as it requires enemy to start fleeing in straight path, somewhat close to you (so you still can horrify behind them). But I think it'd be the coolest self-combo any hero can pull, and almost 1-shot (when dots are done) even tanks.

When I read this, I thought this made sense as dmg reduction to the talent sounded reasonable. However the max still stayed at 150% when I assumed that also got reduced to 100%. This has resulted the quest to rarely get completed as you need to hit 20 heroes before it gets completed. I always completed it in the past, and I believe I've completed it *ONCE* now in 10+ games since patch. It feels like the quest turned into the hardest quest to complete in game.

So I wonder has anyone half-jokingly made a list like this, or given thought to full list of heroes? Or am I alone in being interested in how some heroes work better when given only 20s life compared to normal? Heroes like Gaz really get to throw way more spells out in their only 20s, than the real Gaz would in his next 20s.
