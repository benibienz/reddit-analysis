0,"So that would mean that the vast majority of LATAM players are considered dickheads? Wow, how xenophobic.

So NA players are mostly cool and polite and 99% of all Latin Pro players are jerks? Can you repeat that again? Geesh. 

Odd 95% of NA players didn't get banned.

Only dickhead IMO is the idiot who made that blanket 50 reports = ban rule.

And how IRONIC a certain Caster  in NA BMED repeatedly for THREE YEARS with DOZENS of videos IMMORTALISED to prove it and never, never, ever got more than a slap on the wrist whereas 95% of LATAM players got banned arbitrarily. Oh, I forgot, those LATAM pros don't work for HIREZ and thus don't get political immunity!

Seems there's no justice anywhere, this is CORRUPTION DEFINED. 

It's like Kim Jon Un ruling in LATAM versus Jesus forgives any Sin in NA. 

What the ***** is going on here?

It's crystal clear something is deeply wrong here.

2,"I'm with you in the sense that i'd be pissed also, but i've been through all the emotions, anger, dissapointment....the servers have been broken for so long and Hirez ignoring it also for so long I actually now pity the company for their lack of responsability. So unprofessional to let this continue after 3 years. ",2015-08-30 07:05:53+00:00,cukjmf8,2,t1_cukjg8h,565,Smite
3,"I've read on Internet and I think it's called rubberbanding when our ping goes like from 50 to 800 for a few seconds. Would make sense because when I check my ping it says around 50 BUT I don't keep the ping indicator on, will try to keep it on and see. 

I'd say ""Please fix your servers Hirez"" but I mean, what's the point in asking something that has been ask a billion times and hasn't been adressed yet.

The OP should be watched closely, smells quite fishy. ",2015-08-30 06:55:03+00:00,cukjfa6,2,t1_cukjdw9,131,Smite
