182,"Props for asking for help and not being another Dunning-Kruger case. 

For your question about dodging torps. Whenever detected expect torps and use those WASD hacks, change you speed and course at least every 30 seconds if not more often. Just as little as dropping your throttle ¼ and turning 45 degrees can throw off a DDs aim by miles. If you do spot torps turn into them and drop your throttle to minimize the hits or thread the needle altogether 

Please don't sit back sniping the entire time, because of the poor accuracy of BB's guns you tend to do more damage at ranges shorter then 10km.

Don't pop your damage control for one fire. Let it burn. Your repair party can heal the majority of fire damage.

Never ever show your broadside, angle your armour and if you want to fire all your guns angle you ship to the smallest angle you can to fire all your guns the close up that angle.

Keep watching your mini map as the big gun you will be the priority target for CVs and watch your map for opportunities to push. Communicate through the chat if you plan on pushing so you don't become the sore thumb in front of all your team.

Edit: turn on alternative battle interface and use the dynamic crosshair. Each tick is a second of shell travel time for a ship going 20 knots. Rule of thumb I use is for DDs double the amount of ticks and for CA multiply it by 1.5 (until you learn speeds of different ships). Also watch their smoke stacks to see their approximate throttle setting.

While reloading hold RMB to look around while keeping guns on target. Keep your situational awareness

""Keep in mind everyone, that these flags have to be MANUALLY CREDITED. The system doesn't do it on its own. As mentioned previously, we've have thousands of entries to go through. Definitely an overwhelming response. I was able to credit out 1500 yesterday, That is less than 10% of the total flags and responses. Couple this with my having a major health issue this week that put me out of commission for a couple days. I will continue to work as fast as possible come Monday to get these out. Please be patient. I will make sure each and every one of you all gets your flag.""",2016-11-13 00:41:15+00:00,d9xtlv3,1.0,t3_5cmy50,6707.0,WorldOfWarships

585,"A little back story. We dropped into a match and he was pretty vocal asking about his Kawachi and asking if it got better with upgrades. Most of the people in the game told him that unfortunately no it didn't, I used Zoupgaming's description of it. After I got my ass royally handed to me in my Ishizuchi (itchy and scratchy) he asked me to spectate him and give him pointers. So I did. I told him where to do the the most damage and where to find the citadel (moments later he was shocked as he 100 to nothinged a caledon), we informed him not to sail in straight lines and to angle while reloading. He went on to basically carry the game while brawling a Myogi.

Well done Ischemia87, and keep it going. For a new player he learns fast. If you ever see him send a few pointers his way.

601,"After a few more days dedicated to playing the RN CLs I have come to the conclusion that yes they are fragile but so is 95% of all other cruisers, the nice part is that because they have less armour then most DDs as long as BB shells don't hit your citadel they will overpen and never arm the fuses. Also the high tier repair party heals citadel damage which is great and they have a massive heal rate. Their maneuverability is superb.

672,"That's that's because WG and their blind as fuck supertesters castrated the entire line. Even if they gave the HE a 3-5% fire chance to please the whiney BB players, I would be happy. 

I am not an amazing player but I am definitely above average. Before the RN CLs came out I don't think I have ever had a game in any ship with below 20-25k damage. Many of my RN CL games have been 700, 1000, 1500 damage matches. That to me says there is something wrong. I have also never been the last place on my team until yesterday, I usually hover around 4-8 place. The excuse that the torps are a balancing factor is a piss poor excuse too. By the time you get into torpedo range you've taken 40 citadels to the face. The smoke is extremely situational and anyone who is good with torps or manually aiming their guns will kill you in it too. 

I would've thought that WG would look at their current cruisers with 152mm guns and see the pure AP on ships like the Cleveland and Kutuzov is a terrible idea. Come to think of it the smoke on the Kutuzov is multitudes better then the RN smoke.

Bottom line is the RN CL line is a disgrace to the Royal Navy and her fans that were waiting with bated breath for any RN ship (I personally bought the Warspite and Cambeltown because they were the only RN ships in the game). I have got up to the Edinburgh and I will be going no further on the line. I will be buying the Belfast because it has HE and is the only RN CL that deserves the RN flag until WG sees the light and give the RN back their HE.",2016-10-23 17:34:27+00:00,d94g34s,1.0,t3_58zamk,4288.0,WorldOfWarships

Because they have publishers with bean counters that won't allow it. 

Other then the money from the Kickstarter, sales of the game and sales from the Frontier store. frontier has one other investor (I don't think we have ever been told who) that wants nothing more then Frontier to make the best game they can possibly make without that investor's interference.

1523,"**Shell Normalization**

Shell normalization is the number of degrees by which an armor piercing shell ""turns"" upon contact with armor in an attempt to reach the most advantageous angle for penetration (often 90 degrees). Before, this parameter was set up individually for each shell type depending on ballistic and other properties. However, this approach turned out to be not entirely correct within the gameplay process and added more vague aspects to the way the damage model works. Starting with this update, the normalization will be set up uniformly for all armor piercing shell types and will depend only on the shell caliber:

Up to and including 139mm—10 degrees

140 to 152mm—8.5 degrees

153 to 240mm—7 degrees

241mm and more—6 degrees.

The change is in a systematic manner and will slightly increase the predictability of armor penetration for players. It is not aimed at changing the efficiency of individual ships and will not have any significant impact on gameplay.

**Cyclone**

We made the following adjustments to cyclone parameters to increase predictability of its conditions:

 	    **Update 0.5.9**	
                               
Randomly begins 4-10 minutes into battle	
      
              Lasts 4-10 minutes	
                                  
           **Update 0.5.10**

Begins seven minutes after battle start

            Last 5-7 minutes



The overall chance of a cyclone when playing in a battle of the appropriate tier remains unchanged (10%)

**Interface Improvements**

Added detailed information about ships player destroyed in battle, including ship type and method of destruction

Added the ""Introductory Mission"" and ""Service Record"" banner in Port for novice players

Improved the display of later-tier ships in the tech tree of the ""Modules"" screen

Increased the font size of the ships types in the ""Tech Tree"" tab

Increased the size and revised the design of icons appearing above the target when modules are damaged, making it easier to distinguish between incapacitated from destroyed modules

Increased visibility of ""Update"" button (for replacing Daily Mission with a new random Daily Mission)

Added a placeholder for the in-game browser that will be displayed if YouTube cannot be accessed

Improved Actions, Events and Challenges UI elements

**Added additional information to post-battle screen, including:**

Damage and number of fires caused to enemies spotted by the player

Potential maximum damage from shells, bombs and torpedoes that hit the player's ship (with or without causing damage to her)

Potential damage from shells, bombs and torpedoes that were fired/launched by the enemy at the player's ship but did not hit her

Number of enemy ships, squadrons and torpedoes spotted by the player
Capture points and defense points earned

Added additional information the player's Profile screen, including:

**Statistics for individual ships**

Total damage allies caused to enemies spotted by the player

Highest damage allies caused to enemies spotted by the player in a single battle

Average damage allies caused to enemies spotted by the player

Total number of enemy ships spotted by the player

Highest number of ships spotted by the player in a single battle

Average number of ships spotted per battle

Participation in capturing and defending key areas calculated as a percentage ratio (ratio of the points earned by the player to the points earned by the rest of their team)

Total potential damage

Highest potential damage received per battle

Average potential damage received per battle

Interface Optimization

**We optimized the following actions that players can carry out via the game interface:**

Display of statistical data by pressing the ""Tab"" key during battle

Expanding ship performance characteristics panel in the Port

Display of the post-battle statistics screen after the end of a battle

1524,"**German Battleships**

There's a new line of German battleships stretching from tier III to tier X, including Nassau, Kaiser, König, Bayern, Gneisenau, Bismarck, Friedrich Der Groβe, and Groβer Kurfürst. Perfect for players that love close-quarters combat. Here's what makes them distinctive:

Inclined armored decks that make it harder to hit their citadels at close range

Efficient secondary armaments

Main guns feature a high rate of fire and quick turret traverse

Plenty of hit points

Well-protected hull sides thanks to generous armor

**Audio Improvements**

Improved sounds for bomb explosions and fires

Reworked sounds for the Surveillance Radar and ""Hydroacoustic 

Search"" consumables

Improved ambient sounds for the ""Ocean"" Port

Improved logic for playing enemy detection messages while in the 

Binocular View

Enhanced and reworked distant sounds

**Maps and Locations**

Improved the appearance of the ""Zipangu"" Port

Removed waterfalls on the ""Estuary"" map

Rebalanced geometry of the upper area of the ""Neighbors"" map

Moved the decorative air field on ""The Atlantic"" map

Improved the appearance of ""Fault Line"" and ""Two Brothers"" maps

**Improvements for Novice Players**

As part of an ongoing effort to improve the experience for new players, we made the following changes for all tier I ships:

Only one shell type: practice shell. Its properties are the same as HE shells

Removed researchable main battery modules and added researchable Gun Fire Control System modules
Decreased scaling amount of HP and shell damage by 50% for ships
Divisions

In an effort to improve team balance, players in a Division will only be able to enter battle in ships within one divison of each other. For example, a division of two players in a tier V Kirov and tier VI Fuso would be able to enter battle, but if the Fuso player chose a tier VII Nagato instead, the Division is blocked from entering battle.

**Permanent Camouflage**

Added permanent camo options for Bismarck, North Carolina, 
Benson, and Chapayev:

Cost: 3,000 Doubloons

-3% to detection range; +4% to maximum dispersion of shells at 
ship with camouflage

-5% to the cost of the ship's post-battle repair; +50% to XP earned in the battle

**Secondary Battery Mechanics**

Secondary guns will no longer cause damage to allied ships.

**Colorblind Mode**

This adapts the color palette for colorblind players. To enable, select the option via the Settings screen. There are three options for corresponding syndromes:

Deuteranopia (green blindness)

Protanopia (red blindness)

Tritanopia (blue blindness)

Most of these examples are from Elite lore.

I just want exploration to be more than jump into a system, pop your system scanner, check your system map for anything that might be of value, if nothing then jump away, if something travel to it, scan, then jump away.

Don't get me wrong I enjoyed my exploration trips that I have made but it really does get boring after constantly jumping into brown dwarf systems with pink dead planets. I absolutely love finding landfall moons around gas giants and landing on them to watch the gas giant rise or set on the moon's horizon. Exploration just leaves me with the feeling that much more could be added.

Only then will I be satisfied with detentions staying in game.

1862,Yes but MM is server side which has no use of the graphical engine. It has been how many years since WoT came out? It's sad that a few lines of code restricting tiers based on the platoon leader haven't been added in that long. Not to mention the 2 years since the fix showed up on the console.,2016-06-08 17:34:13+00:00,d4152rp,3.0,t1_d4142a3,1221.0,WorldOfWarships
1863,"They set it so that the tier for the platoon was dependent on the tier of tank the leader pick and the matchmaking of the tank. +2/-2 spread

For examples I will use tier 8. Scouts are light tanks with scout MM (treated like 1 tier higher tanks), normal is normal progression tanks that aren't scouts, and for the purposes of the example assume when I say premium tank that it has premium MM (will only ever se a max of +1 MM)

If the leader picked a scout (tier 8) then the platoon could pick tier 7/8 scouts, or tier 9/10 normal tanks

Leader picks a tier 8 normal tank the platoon could pick tier 8 scout (this would guarantee a min tier 9 game), tier 8 normal and tier 7/8 premium (this will ignore premium MM)

Leader picks a tier 8 premium the platoon could pick tier 6/7 scout, max tier 7 normal, or tier 8 premium.

Any tanks incompatible with the MM of the platoon are blacked out with ""incompatible"" in red stamped across the image in the garage

This would be an even easier fix for WoWs since scouts don't exist and most premium have normal MM",2016-06-08 17:30:43+00:00,d414wmq,3.0,t1_d4144jm,936.0,WorldOfWarships

The thing I don't agree with when it comes to the premiums being added to the tree is the fact that the ships being added to the trees are different between the EU and NA servers",2016-05-19 16:59:34+00:00,d3bsrjc,1.0,t3_4k3e3w,827.0,WorldOfWarships

2217,"Battleships (BB), by law, were named for states, except for USS Kearsarge (BB-5).

Battlecruisers (CC) under the 1916 program were to receive names of battles or famous ships. When cancelled under the Washington Naval Treaty, two were converted to aircraft carriers (CV), and this became the standard for them, with the exception of USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CVB-42), USS Wright (CVL-49), USS Forrestal (CVA-59), and USS Kitty Hawk (CVA-63); some had names evoking flight (e.g., Wasp, Hornet).

""Battlecruisers"" or Large Cruisers (CB) under the 1940 program were named for United States Territories.

Cruisers, both light and heavy (CL and CA), were named for cities in the United States and Territories, with the exception of USS Canberra (CA-70).

After the first nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser, USS Long Beach (CGN-9), CGN's of the California and Virginia classes were named for states. (USS Bainbridge and USS Truxtun were commissioned as frigates).

Destroyers (DD) and destroyer escorts (DE) were named for Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard heroes.

Destroyer Leaders (DL) were likewise named after naval heroes; these were reclassified as cruisers or destroyers in 1975.

Frigates (FF), formerly ocean escorts, were also named for naval heroes.

Submarines (SS and SSN) were either given a class letter and number, as in S-class submarines, or the names of fish and marine mammals.

Oilers (AO and AOR) were named for rivers with Native American names, and colliers named for mythical figures.

Fast combat support ships (AOE) were named after US cities.

Ammunition ships (AE) were named either after volcanoes (e.g. Mauna Loa) or words relating to fire and explosions (e.g. Nitro and Pyro).

Combat stores ships (AK, AF, and AFS) were named after stars and other heavenly bodies.

Minesweepers (MS) were named for birds, or after ""positive traits,"" e.g. Admirable and Dextrous.

Hospital ships (AH) were given names related to their function, such as Comfort and Mercy.

Fleet tugs (AT) and harbor tugs (YT) were named after American Indian tribes.

The first forty-one nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) (called ""boomers"") were named after historical statesmen considered ""Great Americans.""",2016-05-17 22:58:23+00:00,d39gknh,1.0,t3_4js6cv,18493.0,WorldOfWarships

Also I would like to see more torpedoes on BBs and BCs. Historically the New York had underwater tubes (this of course would be one time use) and they are short range. Also early on in the HMS Hood's life, she had under and above water tubes, when she was sank she only had above water tubes due to a refit between the wars. This and the fact that the Nelson class battleship had torpedoes makes me think that the RN BB line will have torpedoes on a lot of their BBs.

You can understand that the reason I hate this idea is because I am a primarily IJN DD player. I understand that yes the infinite torps in such a small ship is ridiculous, though to only problem torps are the ones that hit the enemy team.

2887,"My honest opinion on CQC..... Personally if I wanted to play CoD or Battlefield (which won't happen in the foreseeable future) then I would play CoD or Battlefield. I bought this game for the massive Galaxy and the freedom (for the most part) to blaze your own trail and be the hero of your own story.

Also CQC is split so far apart from the main game. If they made it so that the arenas were orbiting planet or in asteroid fields throughout the Galaxy and you could transport your CQC ship onboard you own ship and dock with the arenas to either compete or bet on the matches then that might be cool. All of that may still could when you are able to get out of your seat and walk around your ship, stations and planets.

To best of my knowledge arenas is really meant as an introduction to the rest of elite dangerous however it is missing a huge chunk but I guess it is a good idea to get FPS players in.

3846,"On behalf of the r/Eliteone community:

1) Is there a concrete release date for the full release? If so when?

2) When will the Xbox one be receiving the Horizons season? And will we be receiving the Cobra Mk IV since we are still in our first year?

3) What is the plan going forward with Horizons and beyond for Xbox - can we expect releases on xbox to always lag behind PC? Will there be a point you can see on your current roadmap where an expansion simply will not be feasibly able to release on xbox, and will therefore be PC only? (Credit: u/Kiggsworthy)

4) Any sneak peek into what ships are going to be included in 1.5 Ships?

5) Will there be a content beta program on the Xbox? just like the PC and Mac beta program

6) Will there be anything exclusive (ship, paint job, etc) for those of us that are part of the GPP?

7) Having read the patch notes for 1.4, there seems to be no mention of the efforts to counter Combat Logging. Is this something on FD's radar for the near future? (Credit: u/sidvicc)

8) Will we ever have a unified account across PC, Xbox, and Mac? One player character on all platforms? (Credit: u/Kiggsworthy)

9) With games like Fallout 4 receiving mod support, will Elite: Dangerous be receiving support for mods like: Voice attack, the ability to change HUD Colors, etc?

10) Can we expect updates to mining, making it more profitable or challenging maybe involving any additional risk/reward.. Mining closer to gravity wells or higher threat areas? (Credit: u/smallshinyant)

11) Will we ever see cross play between PC/Mac and Xbox players? (Credit: u/benjamari214)

12) Ever since release the Xbox community has noticed that there is little to no communication regarding issues (most notably CQC matchmaking and server connection issues) with the game. As a community from the Xbox we are used to openness (issue/bug trackers, acknowledgement from the community managers of problem and whether or not they are being worked on), is there any chance of us seeing more openness from Frontier Developments?

13) Why was the ability to use debug/game preview while in supercruise taken out? (Credit: u/A_Fhaol_Bhig)

14) Would it be possible to assign the debug mode to the back button instead of it being used to bring up friends? (Credit: u/A_Fhaol_Bhig)

15) Can we get details on what the wipe will involve for us? Will all First Discoveries be wiped, or only those that collide with PC First Discoveries? Which system do we spawn in? Will we keep our ships and their upgrades? (Credit: u/dangerz)

16) Will game preview members get a similar tag to the PC guys who pledged early, since we didn't really have a option to pledge for Xbox? (Credit: u/CROAT_56)

17)Any chance of a HOTAS joystick for Xbox One on the horizon? (Credit: u/swiftkilla77)

18) When will purchasable ship skins be available?

19) How much notice can we expect to receive about the retail release/reset? (Credit: u/retribution002)

20) What can we expect to be lost and what can we expect to keep during the Great Reset of 09/3301? (Credit: u/retribution002)

21) Will people with the Imperial Courier, Imperial Clipper and Federal Dropship who don't have the required rank lose their ships? (Credit: u/retribution002)

22) Is there an ETA on group/private play? (Credit: u/Keltic_Rage)

23) Will we get a screen size adjustment option in the graphics menu? (Credit: u/waifuswagu)

24) After seeing your baby Elite grow since the 80's do you feel you finally have the game you thought of back then or is this a mere stepping stone for your future plans? (Credit: u/bloodcatz)

25) Will Elite fully support the Xbox Elite Controller once it is released and allow full control remapping? (u/sidvicc)

26) Are there any plans to guaranteeing all members of a wing be in the same instance? Right now it can be difficult to get wing members in the same instance. (Credit: u/Belyal)

27) When we do finally get skins will they be the same ones that are currently available for PC users? It would be nice to see some XBONE specific ones. (Bonus) will we have any cool contests like the design a paint scheme contests for the PC/Mac community? (Credit: u/Belyal)

28) When can we expect to see multi-stage missions? (Credit: u/Goldenboyjim)

29) When will the Orca have its day, i.e. when are the shuttling or passenger missions going to enter the game? And can we shuttle other players? (Credit: u/Goldenboyjim)

30) Is there ever going to be unique items; unique weapons, skins, etc? (Credit: u/Goldenboyjim)

31) Will there be the NASA voice filter for xbox one ever? (Credit: IceViper777)

32) Is there any plans for voice commands for Kinect? (Credit: u/aeonofgods)

33) How many total players are there on the XBOX version of the game? How many of these are active? Just trying to work out why the game can be quite barren sometimes. (Credit: u/retribution002)

Bonus question: On a scale of one to awesome, how sweet is /r/EliteOne's sidebar? (Credit: u/bigredal, and u/thebuggalo)

Sixth sense alerts you right away regardless of whether or not anyone is looking at you.

As for premium tanks, I believe they evened out the silver earning rates of premium tanks. So basically any tier eight premium that fits your play style. Be warned though if you are still low tier then tier eight is a different ball game to tier one through seven

4231,"I haven't reached tier x in any arty line but I do plan on unlocking the CGC, T92, BC155 58, and 261.

My opinion so far:

British arty is the most fun especially the Bert. Also they have some of the fastest fire rates and best shell drop angles to a point where you can drop a shell on someone behind a rock or house and the Tier X is like a better T92 with armour. Some of these tanks drive faster backwards because their guns are mounted backwards on the hull of an existing tank

German arty is good to the GW Panther. Tier 8-10 seem to be copies of each other

Russian arty is the least accurate with some of the biggest guns. Tier x looks like it becomes pretty accurate,

French artillery is the smallest caliber guns with the smallest amount of splash but are still accurate. Plus the Tier X is an autoloader.

American arty is the most accurate and highest splash damage guns in the game

Keep in mind I am relaying this from some of my friends that play arty.

My current progress:

British: tier 6

French: tier 6

American: tier 7

Russian: tier 6

German: tier 8",2015-08-04 18:24:19+00:00,ctrd5xz,1.0,t3_3fr4tq,12318.0,WorldofTanksXbox

4516,"Here is what I found on all the Vouchers


I believe I heard that you had to be in the same system though


Wingman Shared Bounties
When attacking wanted vessels, every wingman that takes part in the fight, landing some hits on target will be eligible for an equal share in the bounty claim, as long as they are present when the vessel is destroyed.

Wingman Trade Dividend
When a wingman makes a profitable trade, all other wingmen will receive a trade dividend claim, a small, profit-based credit payment awarded by starports to encourage the protection of traders in the system.

This voucher may be handed in at any starport in the system.

All wingmen in the group get a 5% bonus of the commodity's profit being sold.

Formula: Profit per Ton * Amount sold * 0.05 = Total Bonus

Wingman Shared Exploration
When in the same system as your wingmen, exploration data is awarded for all wingmen present, allowing the entire wing to profit.

The first person to hand the data in is eligible for any bonus payment, but if the data constitutes a new discovery, all wingmen present in the system when the body was scanned will be listed as the discoverers.",2015-07-18 09:44:28+00:00,ct7k2ep,6.0,t1_ct7k03z,291.0,EliteOne

n o o d l z: Do you know what the odds are that we're going to see a wipe of our data from the game preview? What things are most at risk for getting wiped (e.g. I would think first discovery data would be difficult to merge with PC)?

As we add content like CQC to Elite: Dangerous on Xbox One we’re going to have to reset some data, but because the Game Preview is longer than our usual PC beta tests we’re aiming to keep as much progression as possible. Discovery data and Powerplay status will be reset, but we’re looking to ‘cash in’ everyone’s ships and modules so you won’t lose your financial progress, and you’ll be able to re-spec with a whole different kind of ship if you’d like. 

Best of all, we plan to preserve all the Commander data, such as Rank, Credits, Progress to Elite, Xbox Hero Stats and Achievements throughout the Game Preview and even into the full game.
