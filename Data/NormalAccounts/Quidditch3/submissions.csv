Also did I miss a episode at the beginning? where was the fight against Hyuuga. It just seems to start in the middle of the story and have a clip show.

Boulder Victory-class cargo ship Laid down in the Richmond shipyards Sept 1944. She was decommissioned in 1946 and given to Lukenbach steamship company between 47 and the late 50's. Between 66 and 68 she was used by the Military sea transport service shipping military supplies to Vietnam, Japan and the Philippines. She was then struck from the naval records and put up in the National Defense Reserve fleet (Ghost fleet) in Suisun bay from 68 to 98. She was then marked for scrap but was handed over to the Richmond Museum  of History and restored. She is currently part of the Rosie the Riveter/World War II National Historical Park.

My rule that I fly by is: ""never fly without rebuy."" Meaning that if you don't have enough money to pay your insurance cost (5% of the cost of the ship and modules), then it should never leave the landing pad. I personally won't buy a ship until I know I can pay for the ship and modules that I want and three rebuys.

I know our newer players are excited to get their shiny new ship as fast as possible, but be patient and make sure you have enough to pay the rebuy.

You can easily make builds of ships and see what they will cost you and cost for rebuy at:

Edit: As of now the AMA is tomorrow

I was thinking of collecting questions for the AMA for David Braben tomorrow and asking them on behalf of the entire Eliteone community.

These are the questions so far

1) Is there a concrete release date for the full release? If so when?

2) When will the Xbox one be receiving the Horizons season? And will we be receiving the Cobra Mk IV since we are still in our first year?

3) What is the plan going forward with Horizons and beyond for Xbox - can we expect releases on xbox to always lag behind PC? Will there be a point you can see on your current roadmap where an expansion simply will not be feasibly able to release on xbox, and will therefore be PC only? (Credit: u/Kiggsworthy)

4) Any sneak peek into what ships are going to be included in 1.5 Ships?

5) Will there be a content beta program on the Xbox? just like the PC and Mac beta program

6) Will there be anything exclusive (ship, paint job, etc) for those of us that are part of the GPP?

7) Having read the patch notes for 1.4, there seems to be no mention of the efforts to counter Combat Logging. Is this something on FD's radar for the near future? (Credit: u/sidvicc)

8) Will we ever have a unified account across PC, Xbox, and Mac? One player character on all platforms? (Credit: u/Kiggsworthy)

9) With games like Fallout 4 receiving mod support, will Elite: Dangerous be receiving support for mods like: Voice attack, the ability to change HUD Colors, etc?

10) Can we expect updates to mining, making it more profitable or challenging maybe involving any additional risk/reward.. Mining closer to gravity wells or higher threat areas? (Credit: u/smallshinyant)

11) Will we ever see cross play between PC/Mac and Xbox players? (Credit: u/benjamari214)

12) Ever since release the Xbox community has noticed that there is little to no communication regarding issues (most notably CQC matchmaking and server connection issues) with the game. As a community from the Xbox we are used to openness (issue/bug trackers, acknowledgement from the community managers of problem and whether or not they are being worked on), is there any chance of us seeing more openness from Frontier Developments?

13) Why was the ability to use debug/game preview while in supercruise taken out? (Credit: u/A_Fhaol_Bhig)

14) Would it be possible to assign the debug mode to the back button instead of it being used to bring up friends? (Credit: u/A_Fhaol_Bhig)

Granted if the tiger angles its armour yes it does get tough but isn't that the way it should be for heavy tanks. The only reason the German tiger is tier 7 is because it has a better gun than the Japanese tiger
