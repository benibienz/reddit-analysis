1,"Hey first off let me say this a great skin suite. It makes my desktop really work for me but I am having one problem. In the game drawer I am having one game, COD Modern Warfare Remastered, not working. When I try to run the program I get a steam error saying that it must be running steam in order to play. I have other games from steam on there that work fine, its just this one. Any suggestions?
