Is there a way around this? Maybe removing the quest requirements or something along those lines so I can just do what I want without worrying about the level being too high while I still have low level quests to do?

I plan on doing every quest and enjoying the game my second time through and just wanna see if there is a way to do so without worrying about the levels",witcher,So many quests...How do you choose which ones to do?,https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/4r3dan/so_many_questshow_do_you_choose_which_ones_to_do/

Just stop playing, sell your stuff, etc etc but I am hoping to get a few good replies. Long story short I have been a gamer and computer geek my whole life. I love everything about them from building computers to playing the games on them. I have had a succesful website for Halo 3 video capturing back in 2007 with over 10,000 members, I have had a successful youtube channel back in 2012 called GamerGraphicsTV where I pretty much started the whole graphics comparison videos thing with millions of views. Even tried to make a career out of both. 

I find games to be a great way to pass time and have always enjoyed how they can make you relax after a long day. Here in lies the problem though; my wife isnt a gamer, she loves me and loves when I am happy but wishes I didnt spend all my time sitting in my computer chair playing games, watching videos for games, searching for the next game and all that stuff. She goes to bed at a normal time, the time I should, but because I dont actually play games much while everyone is still awake (just basically use my computer) I wait till she falls alseep and I come back downstairs to play games until 12,1,2 in the morning and get up for work at 6.

Now here is the twist. I dont want to do this anymore either, sometimes I get in a mindset where I am done with games and computers and go as far as selling my gear but I always come back to it. I recently just finished The Witcher 3 and my god it was good, so good in fact I felt like nothing else would compare to it and uninstalled my other games because they just looked so blah now. I dont want to come home from work and sit at my computer. I want to come home and cook supper, work out, read a book, go outside in my beautiful yard and enjoy the scenery but no, it always comes back to the same thing. I dont cook and when I do its right back to the computer, might workout once and give up, read one book in my entire life (The Martian) fantastic book btw and cant seem to pick up The Revenent that she bought me and I never go outside because I work outside and have no need for more fresh air. 

Furthermore, the biggest thing of all, my kids. I dont spend much time with them because I am more interested in my computer and games. I love them, they know this and I am always there if they need me for anything but as far as me being the one to initiate activities with them its few and far between, plus they are a chip off the old block and love gaming themselves.

So, that was a failure at a long story short.
