For example, if the sender sends in a package with a total value of RM2000 (Personal Computer or Gaming Console) inside, weighs around 7kg,  and the package declared as gift, what will customs do to the package? Do I need to pay specific taxes and duty?

Not for Export.
You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the various states and of the United States.
You further agree that purchases made will not be exported in violation of export restrictions under U.S. law.

Does this means I cant really send (e.g : PC) package outside US or there's something that I need to know. Thanks in advance.",USPS,"""Not for Export"" questions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/USPS/comments/3rg973/not_for_export_questions/
