-A couple tutors
-Maelstrom Wanderer
-Angry Omnath
-Bribery
-Hydra Omnivore
-Niv-Mizzet og

Hey all, I don't post too often but I lurk frequently and hang out with some of the regulars in person. I've been stuck on the same commander for almost a year now, (although it has evolved and changed win cons so much that it's hardly the same deck). I used to hate proxying but now I've decided that I would like to proxy one or two new decks and work towards acquiring the cards if I like them. So I'm looking for suggestions.

I currently play a Mucktide Reanimator build for Tasigur that has had tremendous success in a playgroup full of:

- Food Chain Zegana (killcritters' build, he is the pilot) 
- Jhoira 
- Food Chain Prossh x2 
- Boonweaver Karador
- Riku Twin
- Brago Stax
- plus a bunch of casual and 75% decks

I'm looking for something plays differently enough from my Tasigur deck that I don't get bored, and price is not an object at all.

Reanimate is a barely printed staple of Legacy, Edh and Cube that is entirely necessary for one of the most well-known decks in Legacy. Many stores around me can't keep them in stock because they are so low, and people seem to hoard them.

Thespian's Stage has a much larger print run, but is a Rare that is needed for a tier 1 deck as well as being fun in EDH. I could easy see it hitting 10-15 no problem

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/tasigur-competitive-multiplayer-1/

-Food Chain Zegana (creator of the list is Killcritters)
-Derevi Enchantress
-Gitrog Dredge Combo
-Boonweaver Karador
-Food Chain Prossh
-and a few other decks that I don't usually need to worry about

This deck is my second crack at a competitive **Multiplayer** build, my city used to have very fun 1v1 tournaments using the multiplayer banned list. These tournaments lasted for years and I have had a great deal of difficulty shifting my deck building mindset out of that format. 

Basically, the deck is a classic ""Tooth and Nail into Palinchron and Deadeye"" with Bubbling Muck and High Tide included as another way of allowing Palinchron to combo. I'm sure there are problems with my list, and my playgroup and I have been hammering out kinks every time our meta shifts. What makes it difficult for me, is that I'm the kind of person who can defend practically any card in my decks, I don't often play **bad** cards, just cards that aren't 100% efficient, but as more of the obvious cuts get made, it gets harder to cut further. 

I read this subreddit frequently, but this is my first time actually posting here, so I was hoping to get some dialogue going about particular things that should be cut and added and for myself to learn from the perspectives of players outside of my usual playgroup. 

The two cards I will speak for in advance are Bribery and The Gitrog Monster. Some people I play with think one or both cards are amazing and should stay, while others think the opposite. My group has come to general consensus that Bribery is a fantastic meta choice, as it acts a Green Sun's Zenith that can get non-green creatures in my meta, often tutoring up my opponents' Palinchrons, Deadeyes or Consecrated Sphinx. Gitrog is the more puzzling one, I rather like it, as it acts as both an Exploration and Phyrexian Arena, or eats a removal spell at the very worst. While in a long game it ends up drawing my 3-4 cards on each of my opponents' turns with Seedborn Muse. 


Anyhow, I apologize for the lengthy post, and thank anyone in advance who can provide some assistance. ",CompetitiveEDH,Looking for Criticism of Combo Tasigur,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveEDH/comments/4vigjz/looking_for_criticism_of_combo_tasigur/
