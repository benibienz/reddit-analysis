19,In my opinion you should do like RubixRed225 suggested.  Go to Concord just to grab the bobblehead and the power armor and then leave.  Not having anything to do with the Minutemen will not affect the game at all.  If you don't do any of the Minutemen  radiant quests then you will have more time to do the other faction's quests.  If you decide later on that you want to start up a few settlements then you can get them all without messing with the Minutemen at all.  ,2016-06-27 16:06:24+00:00,d4pz6ox,1,t3_4q413x,820,fo4

21,Yep.  Each pellet explodes.  Its wonderful.  You do have to be a little careful with it though.  If you shoot an enemy that is too close to you you will take splash damage from the explosion.  Its not enough to kill you if you are close to full health but it can be deadly if you have taken quite a bit of damage.

118,Your first problem is that if you are playing a stealth character the enemies should never know you are there.  I went with a sneaking melee character and either one shot everything I came across or if it was a fight that they knew I was there then I would just stab them to death thru VATS.

177,I prefer the Railroad to the Brotherhood.  I completed the game with the Brotherhood first and kinda just felt dirty after beating the game.  My next playthru was with the Railroad and I felt much better about them.  I felt like the Railroad were actual people that were trying to make the synths lives better.  All the Brotherhood wanted to do was kill everything that wasn't like them.  [I didn't mind the Brotherhood as much until I was forced to kill Paladin Danse just because he was a synth.  I didn't have a high enough Charisma to get him out of it unfortunately.](/spoiler)  ,2016-05-19 00:08:47+00:00,d3ayc05,1,t3_4jzq1v,855,fo4

Besides that I'm carrying around a gauss rifle and a plasma sniper rifle, ammo for both, a few chems, mostly the Grape Mentats for any speech checks I must pass, and a little food and water.

183,What I had to do was put down a floor piece and then put the middle platform on it and then remove the floor piece.  This made it to where the middle platform was a little higher.  Then the emitter was able to snap on correctly.  If this doesn't work try doing it the other way.  Put down many floor pieces to get the emitter a little higher and then remove them.

184,That's another thing I was wondering about.  Why was there only one Pipboy in the whole vault?

185,I've thought about using radiation weapons but it seems only useful against certain enemies.  Seems like a lot of enemies would be resistant to radiation damage.  Would be great against humans because they would have a lower resistance to radiation and if they tried to heal themselves it wouldn't work.  But overall it seems like it is just a damage type that works great against you and just so so against everyone else.,2016-05-18 21:59:53+00:00,d3atf7f,1,t3_4jz45r,1177,fo4

187,"Definitely.  External defenses would be a must.  If the entrance ever got taken then you would be stuck down there.  Would have to have a way to get a message out to allies if you ever got sacked.  If the Minutemen can find a way to get me a message of a settlement that needs my help while I'm in the Institute, it shouldn't be too hard for a vault to get a message out.


You could do like Vault 81 and have an internal farm to provide food as well as have a farm on the outside.  The cryo pods could be used to store extra food in case of attack as well.  I'm sure if you can go in there and come out safe, the food should be fine as well lol.  ",2016-05-18 21:53:09+00:00,d3at599,2,t1_d3asl7z,802,fo4
