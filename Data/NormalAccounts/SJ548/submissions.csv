Like what the hell.  But I digress.  The Institute attacks their base so the logical next step is to nuke them.  Nothing happens between the two factions in between those events either.  It goes from no contact with each other, to the Institute assaulting the Castle, to the Institute getting nuked by the Minutemen.  The Minutemen should be shouting 'Murica! during the whole fight.
