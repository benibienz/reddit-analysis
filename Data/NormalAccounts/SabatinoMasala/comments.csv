The demo tween slider is indeed a custom tool I developed. Basically I just took a part of the game, which I then put into a simple webpage, and then I can embed those demo's anywhere I want.

Take a look at this blog post to see one of those demo sliders in action: http://blog.codecaptain.io/webdevelopment/hittesting-using-the-distance-formula/57
