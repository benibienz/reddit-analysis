Math in game development is not something to be feared, but rather embraced as it can help you tackle many, many issues.

I created a free course to get you started with HTML5 game development in PhaserJS.

In this course we'll cover the powerful game framework **PhaserJS** by creating an exciting game called TapTapTaxi.

PhaserJS is the **go to choice** when developing HTML5 games.

**Pro's**

* Easy &amp; familiar syntax
* Robust framework with great support
* Comes with a huge amount of documentation
* WebGL rendering with automatic canvas fallback
* Cross-platform (!)
* Asset preloading
* Plays sound
* Physics
