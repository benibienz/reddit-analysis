My question essentially is whether Judo, Taekwondo, Boxing, and etc. should all be in one group of martial arts for the Olympics. If not, then if possible I'd like an explanation of why you believe so.  ",martialarts,Martial Arts And Olympics,https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/4w6jyw/martial_arts_and_olympics/

I've been learning Wing Chun recently and I was wondering if it would be good to incorporate side kicks and round house kicks into it. My view on this is that trapping and circular steps will be too slow in a real fight. Blocking would definitely work but the Wing Chun footwork seems too unrealistic in a MMA fight or a real scenario. In order to compensate for safety, it would be wise to incorporate kicks or different attacks that would shift away from traditional Wing Chun to an extent.
