Ceaser is great. He's a major save against Dark Hole/Raigeki or other pesky effects, plus he searches you a contract when he hits the grave.

Also, debating parting out or selling my Monarch deck. I'm wondering if this deck will even be viable without Super Quantams.

I like the deck, more as a casual build since it cost me under 50 to build and I don't want to dump more money into it.
I had a Monarch only build, and I think it's cool, but maybe it be better to sell now that some of the cards have shot up in price. ",2016-02-16 18:29:35+00:00,d025vaf,1.0,t3_462lp1,15352.0,yugioh

Yea, I just added another Veiler in, and ordered another Stygian. I'll test out both of them, but I do feel that Veiler is a lot more versatile as we do search A LOT.

Berfomet will deff be a 3 of when we get the deck, he's too good!
Transmodify is just a temporary card, deff coming out later. Although I might look into replacing it with Skill Drain for now.

Nope. I actually use to play 2 Contract with Errors and it always felt like I didn't need it. So I sided one and added another Valkyrie, I love it. 
Being able to pop cards and adding 1K atk to my monsters during my opponents turn is great. I won against a monarch player because I popped 2 of his Dominions. This deck NEEDS the extra deck.
 I've had so many people try to attack into my Wave King and all I do is flip Valkyrie and he suddenly jumps up to 3400 atk and usually that's more than enough to destroy whatever they were using. 

I've also had 2 of them on the field so that's +2k attack. It's insane OR If I have one on the field and draw the other I can just use it as discard fodder.
 
Void Ogre Dragon actually seems like a really good option!  It could be a good game ender. You could attack for game and not have to worry about a face down card, that and it's a 3k beater. Thanks, deff going to pick one up.
Need to get a Trishula as well. 

Imperial iron wall feels like it would hinder our deck as well, but I'll take a look.

On the other hand, I built one of the newer decks that inlcudes Pendulum cards but doesn't focus on pendulum summoning.

I love the deck, so many combos, makes you think and it puts up a much better fight to the current meta.

Basically what I'm saying is don't be stuck in the past. The game was fun before, but if nothing would have changed it would have gone under by now.
Enjoy the new mechanics.

If you just want to play some old school decks, play with some old friends but don't be upset that you keep losing to someone using the newer stuff.

It's basically like a cyber dragon. Plus if if you use it as a tribute you can special summon back one of your BEWD's ( zero atk/def) and use it for rank 8 plays, or going for other synchros.

One of my favorite plays with it if i have dragon shrine is pitch BEWD and Keeper of the Shrine to the grave. Special Tefnuit, summon either White stone or Maiden and go into black rose and wipe the whole board. This will bring back keeper for defense, or I can pair it with other cards like Silver's Cry or such.

You can also use it's effect of bringing back a normal dragon when playing Overlord Heliopolis' effect as it's considered a tribute to pop cards.",2016-01-04 02:26:16+00:00,cyl2lkh,3.0,t1_cyl1jzr,1778.0,yugioh

Here's my deck. This is my IRL deck if that helps   You can compare.


It took a bit to get it like this.  Lastly i was running 19 monsters and 21 spell/trap cards

I ditched Cards of Consonance (had it at 1) for another wonder wand, and i ditched Torrential Tribute for Electromagnetic turtle.
Also tweaked the Extra Deck.

Sorry for the potato quality pic, it beats typing them out.

Deff ditch galaxy serpent, also I'm not big on cards of consonance. It was always a dead draw for me.


Add another dragon shrine,  ditch 1 BEWD, ditch White Stone --&gt; BEWD gets added to your hand. Useful for trade-in. Always try to keep one BEWD in hand. 

Also sometimes I'll ditch Keeper Of The Shrine with Dragon Shrine. Then I go into Black Rose, wipe the board and special summon Keeper back on to the field for defense or use it as fodder to summon a BEWD and do damage.
