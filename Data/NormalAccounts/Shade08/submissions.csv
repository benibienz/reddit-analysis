Here's my story

I've know this girl for a few 2-3 years, but it's always been a professional (work) relationship. I always had a thing for her, but I was in a relationship or she would be in a relationship. So fast forward to about 1.5 months ago when we're both single so I take this time to start talking to her, and we end up going out a few days later. 

End of the night we're making out, and both taking off our clothing. Anywho, this happens a few more times before she goes on Vacation for 2 weeks. The thing is, about 2-3 days before she leaves she becomes very cold. Short responses, made excuses not to see me before leaving which was odd, before she was free at any time of the day for me.

Anywho for those 2 weeks we hardly talk, 
 she comes back and I get a message from her ""go with me to ___? I've missed seeing you"" so I'm like ""Sure, why not"" 

We hang out, just mostly talk. I kiss her, she kisses back. End of the night I go to kiss her again, and she pulls back, In my head I'm like ""oh, well that's not good."" 

Since then for the last 2 weeks it's been a bit odd. I've just been ""friendly"" by that I mean I treat her like any other coworker/friend but not like someone I'm dating. 

She'll text me randomly sometimes just to make conversation and stop responding shortly after or she'll ask if I'm at work and offer to bring me snacks/food when she comes in.

She's confusing me, I can't tell if she's interested or...? Or maybe I'm just reading way too much into this.


I've tried forgetting about her. I've gone out with other girls while this was happening. F-closed 2 girls, and I have a date set up this weekend with a gorgeous girl.

I kinda just can't get this one girl out of my head, I really liked her personality. I know what I'm feeling isn't real. I'm picturing all these great characteristics which probably aren't even there...but I'm stuck. 

Around her I can't be my usual cool, calm self. She makes me nervous, and I hate it.

I'm thinking maybe I should just be blunt and ask her how she feels, but the other part of me says ""Dude, let it go you're going to look so desperate""

Has someone else had a similar experience?

Lost to Extra Deck Monarch's (my god this guy was good he had an answer for every single one of my plays) and lost to Kozmo. Now I feel Kozmo is my hardest match up once they get over one of my beaters and destroy the other with DD's effect I feel like I can't slow them down enough and those pilots just keep tapping out if I attack or they do.

So I need help, how do I put up a fight to Kozmo?

I've changed up my deck a lot, but I think i finally have it to where I like until July, 15th! 
I plan to take it this week to my locals, hopefully do decently.



Let's start, let me know what you guys (and gals) think.


**Monsters**

- 3x - D/D Savant Kepler  - search them contracts!

- 3x - D/D - Necro Slime - Poly from the grave, discard fodder. 

- 3x - D/D - Swirl Slime - Poly from the hand, special summon from the grave. So many plays with this guy

- 3x - D/D/D Oblivion King Ragnarok - rank 8, big Defense, banishes cards and special summons a D/D/D card from your grave.

- 2x - D/D/D Rebel King Leonidas - I know everyone plays 3, and I have the third,  but he's JUST OK. He's not great. 2600 is fairly easy to run over, and D'arc is just so much better.

- 2x - D/D/D King Pendragon - same attack as Leonidas, can pop spells and traps and gains 500ATK while doing so. Plus he goes to the grave instead of the extra deck so he can be used to bring out the big guy.

- 2x - D/D Berfomet - D/D Rank 4 and Rank 8 plays

- 2x - Effect Veiler - dual use. Either hanf trap, or use it as a tuner.  Win win.

- 1x - Stygian Security - Dual use too, he's a tuner, and if I set him and he's run over or I crash him into something I can bring out Kepler due to his effect. Perfect as a one of.

**Spells**

- 3x - Contract With the Hellgate - add one D/D monsters once per turn. Yay. Burn for 1k, maybe. 

- 3x - Upstart Goblin - need to draw combo pieces asap. 

- 2x - Twin Twisters - I don't mind discarding, pop 2 spells/scales or traps

- 1x - Dark Contract with Swamp King - really want this at 2, but space is tight and I only use it to bring out the big guy mid to late game and I'll usually bounce it back to my hand.

- 1x - Foolish Burial - this deck loves stuff in the grave, slimes, D/D/D's etc etc.

- 1x - One for One - I have nine level 1's in total. Summoning Kepler is always good or I can bring out a tuner.

- 1x - Raigeki - because why not

-1 x - Allure of Darkness - I was kind of on the fence about this card, but I need to draw into things, and almost all of my monsters are DARK attribute. Plus I can bring back what I've banished if I need to.

**Traps**

- 2x - Dark Contract with the Valkyrie - once per turn targetting Raigeki Break. Plus 1K atk to all my fiends on my opponents turn. 

- 1x - Solemn Warning - good card, but I might pick up a Solemn Strike instead.

- 1x - Call of The Haunted - I feel that it's  good card in this deck. Can open up plays. 

- 1x - Vanity's Emptiness - I can turn this on &amp; off, and I can use it to slow down my opponent.

- 1x - Dark Contract With Errors - have a D/D monster on the field,  turn on and off traps once per turn.

That's it for the main.
Now the Extra

**XZY**

- 2x - D/D/D Wave King Caeser - Easy to get into rank 4. He's like a soul charge, and when he goes to grave you can search a Dark Contract.  Great card IMO

- 1x - D/D/D King Tell - love this guy. He's like a cowboy for 1k when you take damage, and he's a Foolish Burial when he goes to the grave. 

- 1x - Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon - great when you leave your opponent with less than 1k LP and just a good card overall. Very easy to make.

- 1x - Mecha Dracossack - he's pretty ok. Can't be destroyed if you have token, and he can pop stuff.  Maybe would swap him out for another Red-Eyes Flare. 

- 1x - #11 BIG Eye - Steal your opponents stuff. DealWithIt

- 1x - D/D/D Kali Yuga - Cold wave, destroy all spells and traps, set 1 dark contract from your grave onto the field and 3500atk. Yes.

**Fusions**

- 3x - D/D/D Joan of D'Arc - easy to go into, make contracts or any burn damage pay you. 

- 2x - D/D/D Oblivion King Caeser Ragnarok - LOVE this guy. He's huge and he can steal monsters and gain their attk and he doesn't target. 

**Synchro**

- 1x - Scarlight Dragon Archfiend - because he's good against a lot of decks, he's big and he can still attack after using his effect.

- 1x - PSY Omega - bring back whatever you banish (Swirl, yes) to make more plays or just get rid of a card in your opponents hand for a turn. 

- 1x - Beelze Diabolic Dragon - can't be destroyed by battle or effects. Crash it into D. Destroyer's all day. Plus it's actually not that hard to make considering I only have 1 Dark Tuner. 



**Side Deck**

2x - Majesty's Fiend

1x - Effect Veiler

2x - Wavering Eyes

1x - Twin Twisters 

1x - Time-Space Trap Hole

1x - Storming Mirror Force

1x - Deck Devastation Virus

http://imgur.com/NedLWpG

Here's a screen shot. Sorry for not typing out the card names, but I'm on mobile and doing so would take ages.

I'm mostly content with the deck, and how it performs. Last week I went 3-1 at locals before I ended up having to leave :l

Played 2 Monarch players, 1 Graydle &amp; Yang Zing set up and lost to BA. Damn you BA. Haha. 
Bricked so hard on game 1 against the BA player, 3 Leonidas and 2 Ragnarok. Ouch. 


Anywho, I do practice draws and such to see how I would open my first hand, and the card I always draw and feels dead most of the time is D/D Galilei.

I'm stuck between adding in another Veiler, Stygian Security or D/D Berformet to replace it.
They all have their pros.

Stygian is a tuner and can get me kepler on the field if I need to, and kepler gets me a contract once it hits the field.

Veiler = because hand trap and a tuner

Berfomet = can go into a lot of crazy plays. I've used him so many times to go into Wave King and Kali Yuga plus he's fodder for all my D/D summons. 
Then again, I'm not sure if 3 would be too much for the deck at the moment.


Also, what do you guys think about my side deck? Feel free to nit pick. 
Btw forgot to include  {Time-Space Trap Hole} which is also in my side.


and yes, I know Castiel isn't the greatest as I can hardly make him, but I'm not sure what I would replace him with.

It's been ages since I played and recently decided to get back into the game.  I'm currently working on 2 decks. D/D/D (so many combos) and this BEWD deck that I need everyones opinion on, I was actually putting it together before the new BEWD support was annouced, so I'm stoked for that. 
Anywho I've played with this deck online and it's held up fairly well, but I'm always open to improvement.

First off this is a 41 card deck. I'll start

Monsters 20


x3 - Blue-Eyes  - it's a BEWD deck so yea. 


x3 - Maiden With Eyes of Blue. -  bring out blue eyes, and other synchro monster fairly easy


x2 - White Stone of Legend. - again for Sychro plays and to search out BEWD from my deck. 


x2 - Swordsman of Revealing Light - I know I know, not many people like him, but he's good for my rank 8's and another target for Trade-In. Plus it has saved my butt a few times online.


x2 - Delta Flyer - sychro plays, and I can also trigger Maiden with it.


x2 - Honest - it's a Light based deck


x2 - Hieratic Dragon of Tefnuit - fairly easy to summon, and once again comes in handy for Sychro plays.


x2 - Bright Star Dragon - same as Delta Flyer, 1900 beat stick, rank 4's


x1 - Red Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon - easy to bring out, and let's me recycle a drain from my hand or graveyard 


x1 - Keeper of The Shrine  - good tribute fodder, annoying to get rid of, and can send BEWD from grave back to my hand which can come in handy for Trade-In.

SPELLS 14


x2 Trade-In (thinking about going to 3 and removing cards of consonance)


x1- Cards of Consonance - just at 1 since I typically pitch White Stone with Dragon Shrine


x1 - Book Of Moon - I still think it's a good card and I've even used it to trigger Maiden


x1 - Soul Charge


x1 - One For One


x1 - Raigeki


x1- Wonder Wand - for maiden and some more draw power.


x2 - Silvers Cry


x2 - Dragon Shrine - get BEWD in the grave asap


x2 - Forbidden Lance - good against opponents,  card effects and can also trigger maiden


Traps! 7 of em!


x1 - Storming Mirror Force - bounce back those annoying monsters


x1 - Bottomless Traphole


x1 - Compulsory Evacuation Device


x1 - Torrential Tribute


x1 - Call of the Haunted - bring back a tuner for a synchro play


x2 - Fiendish Chain - Protect mah blue eyes!


Extra Deck


-Armades, Keeper of Boundaries


- Black Rose Dragon


-Black Rose Moonlight Dragon


- Clear Wing Synchro Dragon


-Stardust Spark Dragon


-Hot Red Dragon Archfiend


-x2 - Azure Eyes Silver Dragon


- Star Eater


- Castel,  The Sky Musketeer


- Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon


- Number 101: Silent Honor ARK


- Number 107: Galaxy Eyes


- Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand


-Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord


Side deck.
I'm still kinda iffy on this, so far i have

x3 - MST


x2 - Wavering Eyes


x1 - Anti-Spell Fragrance 


x2 - Great Horn of Heaven


x1 - Vanity's Emptiness


x1 - Dimensional Prison


x1 - Solemn Warning


x1 - Melody of Awakening Dragon


x1 - Electromagnetic Turtle


x1 - Effect Veiler


x1 - Full House


So there it is, please cut me some slack if i have a few mistakes. Did this all on mobile...took a minute. Haha

I used to play waaaaay back when I was 11 or so. I remember watching the original episodes. I had all my old cards in the ""XYZ Dragon Cannon"" tin. Unfortunately misplaced it when I moved 5 years ago, I'm sure it's still in a box somewhere in the garage. I never really bothered to look for it because I figured it had died down, but they were still cool and nostalgic to me, so I had to keep them. I kinda want to look for them, I have all the cards from the original starters or packs like LOB, MRD, PSV, LON etc etc.

Just recently started trying to get back into the game. A LOT has changed. It looks like normal monsters aren't even relevant anymore. Also, slightly concerned that maybe people will think I'm a bit too old to be playing? I mean, it's a fun game, so don't fault me for wanting to play. It also takes me back to those carefree days as a kid. 

Bought a GearGear structure, wasn't really impressed. They were too cute for me, so I also ordered a Spellcasters Command and Dark World structure deck to build off of. I always liked Yugi/Bakura hence the decks/themes. Also stated making my own fiend deck. 

Being an adult I did something I could never do as a kid...I bought a box, packs and singles. (Battle Pack 2. remembered the Gods, didn't recognize anything else on the others) The 11 year old in me was ecstatic. 

Anywho. Just looking for tips, looked up the ban list so my decks will be ""advanced"" format. Are there any cards I should know of? things like ""Ring of Destruction"" having new rulings. What old cards are useless now?  Better replacements?
New rules? It's been years since I've actually played IRL.

I come here because I'm having some inner turmoil.
Two months ago I broke up with my gf, because I thought it was the best for us. I told her I loved her, but I wasn't sure if I was in love with her (if that even makes sense) and that it was probably the best thing for us to be apart. 

I'm the bad guy in all this, my ex was a wonderful and caring person. Even in the end, with tears in her eyes she told me that if this is what I thought was best, that she would respect my decision. 
She even managed to make us laugh after telling me ""if you try to come back in 2 weeks, I'm going to tell you to fuck off"".  I initially thought I had made the right choice, I've even dated other people to help me get over her faster and none of it is working.
I find myself constantly thinking about her, dreaming about her, and just kinda moping around. We had even talked about marriage and now it all just feels so odd, trying to picture myself with someone else. I can't bring myself to even change her contact name or picture, I have everything she ever wrote me or drew for me saved in a box which I refuse to get rid of.
I don't know if I made a mistake or I'm just going through the motions. 

I just don't know, I don't even know what else to right. I just need someone to talk to.

Forgive the long wall of text/errors. Did this on my phone, while sitting in class staring at wall.

I'm a 23 yo guy, nursing student and work night shifts. Not really too overweight  (5'7 165lbs) haven't been working out as much as I should lately. 


Anywho, i'm having trouble getting fully erect and maintaining it. It's taking a huge blow at my self-esteem and confidence. A bit of back story, I've always been very sexual. I would masturbate multiple times a day, and my ex gf (due to our schedules) would have sex 6-7 times a week. I would see an attractive girl in public and I would already be picturing her in my bed.
I never had any issues with this before,  I was always ""ready to go""
Forward a few months,  and I'm single and recently started dating this amazing girl. The first time we tried having sex, I couldn't for the life of me get it up. 
I blamed it on my anxiety. The week prior I had been feeling really anxious, twitchy, shaky and panicking (never before had theirs happened to me) 
So I go to the Doctor and he says I'm having severe anxiety, that my schedule is too stressful and I need rest. So I take a few days off. So I do, couple weeks go by and I'm feeling much better. Anywho, I did notice that prior to that week,  I had no sex drive, I hadn't even thought about sex or masturbated, but it was in the back of my mind that I didn't even realize it.
 
Back to the girl,  we've been dating for about 6 weeks and we've been having sex for the last 3. I can count on my hand how many times I've gotten fully erect and had a good session. Most other times I can't stay hard for more than a few minutes, and if I do I can't get fully erect.
It sucks because I REALLY like this girl, she's gorgeous. She's been extremely supportive about the issues I'm having. I don't want her to think it's her,  because it's definitely not. She's so hot. I want to pleasure her, and I hate that I can't. It's getting to the point where I'm scared to even do anything sexual because I'm afraid I'll just leave her all hot and bothered. I'm on the verge of just laughing and crying. 

I'm planning to go the Doctors on Monday and discuss the issues I'm having.

I needed to vent, and ask if anyone else has had something similar happen? What helped? I'm freaking out, why am I broken. I hate this. I miss having good, fun, spontaneous sex.",sex,Young guy (23) suffering from [erection issues] freaking out.
