3,"Last year I was standing in line the first day waiting anxiously to get in when this lovely young lady started talking to me. We had good conversation then out of nowhere she gets nasty and cranked out. She starting getting super homophobic with me. ""FUCK YOU BECAUSE YOU LIKE IT UP THE ASS!"" Which I replied back with ""I LIKE IT UP THE ASS BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD!!"". She then stopped stared at me, gave me her middle fingers then walked away. 

Even though she was pure bad vibes I felt bad cause she was all cranked out on some bad shit. 

Also, the State Police just watched her harass and yell at me but did nothing to stop her. That's whack. ",2016-05-06 14:00:13+00:00,d2v4c2l,1,t3_4i2peo,49826,ElectricForest

5,"As I was getting my hit ready I decided why not just get add another scoop. As soon as I took the hit I knew I took too much. My vision became all lines and I could see energy.

The lines in my vision started to vibrate and move whenever something disturbed the silent room. Shorty I closed my eyes and entered hyperspace. It was my first time blasting off. That extra scoop was totally worth it!!",2016-04-07 00:04:25+00:00,d1svcqb,1,t3_4dbq16,201601,DMT
