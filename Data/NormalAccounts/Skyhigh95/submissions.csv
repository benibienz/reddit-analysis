With the destination in mind, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with many emotions. I've heard of thousands of people, traveling from all over to experience something I've never came close to experiencing myself. This wonderful place gives you the opportunity to create whatever experience you want. It’s a place where you feel as if you’ve found your ""home"", with strangers who are much like your family. You expand beyond your comfort zone. You let go of your fears and inhibitions. It is a place so magical, so breath taking, you never want to leave. The five day journey I embarked on had me feeling a couple different emotions. I felt nervous, excited, and eager to experience something new.

Ever hear of Rothbury Michigan?  I hadn’t either, not until this past summer. 5:30 am Wednesday morning came pretty quick. I woke up to “Sarah, get your ass up, it’s time to go!” I didn’t realize I had hit my snooze alarm, more than once. Thankfully, Charlee wasn’t too upset. We still left at the desired time. Rothbury is about a three hour drive, four, depending on how fast you drive. It’s a tiny little town, nothing much there. We didn’t noticed our surroundings on our way down, we were just too excited to get to our destination. Rothbury is about thirty minutes out of Muskegon. It is on eastern shores of Lake Michigan. Finally, after getting into Muskegon, Charlee, Hunter, and I met up with the rest of our group. We met up at the Meijer store to pick up last minute items before our final stop. 
We had friends coming from all over including Chicago, Washington D.C, North Carolina, and another from Germany. Annika was the girl from Germany. I only heard good things about her but never met her before this event.  We hit it off great. After the short amount of time knowing her we became best friends. She turned to be at one point, grabbing my arm saying “You and I are going to be bud's for the five days”, “deal” I replied with no hesitation.   Jayson is my boyfriend Joe's, best friend, he’s from North Carolina. Skylar is my step brother and he lives in Washington D.C. Charlee, hunter and myself obviously came from Petoskey. Last but not least, Nate and others were from Chicago. 
 
Thursday, had finally came. We woke up, found ourselves wondering around this beautiful place. Annika, Skylar, Jayson, Charlee, Joe, Hunter, and I ventured around this enchanted world of unique audiovisual experiences, astonishing art, dreamlike decorations, and incredible musicians to explore. There was so much to see, so much to experience but not enough time. When you entered Sherwood Forest, there were hundreds of forest-goers lounging around on hammocks hanging from tree to tree. At night Sherwood turns into a raucous party. Sherwood comes alive. Every corner you turn there was something mind-blowing to adventure. The art was so astonishing. You would just get lost looking into something so unimaginable. Secrets just waiting to be discovered.
          
There were several stages, all of them had their own name. Those of which include, Sherwood Court, Ranch Arena, Tripole, Jubilee, and Forest Stage. At Ranch Arena, Major Lazer played the first night. Skylar, Annika, and I were dancing and somehow made it to the middle of the crowd. Mind you, there’s over forty-thousand people attending this festival. It turned 12am, Annika and I turned around and yelled “Happy birthday, Skylar!” I think Skylar got more Happy Birthdays that night then he has his whole life. Let me just say, sleeping was not in our future.
Friday, snuck up on me. “YAS KWEEN”, “boots”, “where's Carl?” were the only phrases I heard from that point on. As we ventured into the forest, you began to notice there were thousands of people dressed up. And by dressed up I mean, there were people dressed up as avatar, rave fairies, they were so “glit”. As the day passed by quickly we found ourselves dancing and having a great time enjoying the artist Mija. She was so amazing, I never heard of her until then. We adventured our way into the middle of the forest, ending up at the Observatory. It was another stage, but one of the smaller ones. Spectacular stores underneath this amazing stadium. There was so many hand made pieces of jewelry. It was breathtaking. We ended up finding this stand where you could make you're own jewelery. Imagine that. 
Saturday had finally arrived. It was so boots. We were wasting the day by enjoying ourselves back at our campsite. Charlee, Annika, and I made each other bracelets. They’re called Kandi in the festival world. After taking it easy all day, we got into the forest and noticed there was a oompa loompa. Seriously, there was an oompa loompa carrying a pineapple. It was so silly, you never know what you might see. People are so creative, they’re so carefree. We had finally arrived at Sherwood Court at 9:30. Porter Robinson was the main guy we wanted to see on Saturday. Porter definitely, did not disappoint. Joe, Skylar, Charlee, Annika, Hunter and myself made our way into the middle of the crowd and made love to the tunes. You know when they say, dance like no one's watching? Well I was definitely dancing like no one was watching. 

Sunday, was a shit show. I woke up to everyone irritated, because it had rained from dawn until 9’oclock. Charlee and Hunter wanted to leave because their tent was flooded, all of their clothes soaked. As time went on, I talked them into staying. We packed up camp before heading into the forest for the final time. As we walked in there we enjoyed every last second. Stick Figure was playing a set at 4:30pm, again Charlee, Annika, and I danced the whole time. I don’t think there was ever a time we were not dancing. Even at this time, the weather was unbearable because it was 90 degrees and humid, not a good combination when your dancing your ass off. Griz was the final show. He played at 1am, so up until he came on we wondered around. You look up, you see these huge balloons that light up the sky purple and electric blue. You look to the left you see clouds strung up from the branches on the trees, it was beautiful. Colors all around you.  We even lay down in a open spot in the tress, looking up seeing all these colorful lights. You would just get lost in you're own imagination looking into these wonderful things they call lights. Crazy huh? 

You know that feeling, the one where you can’t control yourself because you cannot stop smiling no matter how hard you try? The feeling when you’re uncontrollably happy and never want to leave nor have the day be over with? That’s exactly how I felt, knowing that this was where I wanted to be. Somehow this place made you even feel safe, people were so caring, so helpful, and lastly, no one was judging one another. This place, you can be so open minded, it gets you out of reality, out of your shell. This magnificent, glorious place is what I would imagine a perfect world to be like.  My step brother kept telling me “Sarah, when you leave here, it will have changed you"", I never believed that, just thought he was a little crazy. Well it did change me. The amazing feeling that tens of thousands of people feeding off each-others energy. Tangled in each-others love. Why wouldn’t this place change me? It will change anyone.
 
Sadly Griz was over. It was time to depart with this wonderful place I called home these past five days. By the time I knew it we were back at the campsite saying good bye. I just kept thinking about  how bad I just wanted to rewind everything and redo it over, it was not long enough. It was about 4:00 in the morning when we were about to hit the road. We all looked back while pooling out, with smiles on our faces, saying ""Until next year forest"". This experience changed me in so many ways, taught me that you can be who you want to be no matter what other people think or say. It opened up my mind, and leaving there I was no longer judging anyone. I accepted myself for who I was even with my flaws. I would have not wanted to experience my first year at Electric Forest with no one else other than the forest family I was so grateful for to have in my life and to be able to have them share those memories with me. I cannot wait to spend 2017 Electric Forest with my forest family once again and to see what experiences come my way.
