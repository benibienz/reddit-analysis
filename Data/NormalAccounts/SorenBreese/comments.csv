0,"I started playing summoners war over a year ago. The game was off and on for me for the first couple of months due to my frustration and lack of patience/knowledge in the game. Over time and watching many YouTube videos on the game I have gained a lot of knowledge. However even with this knowledge I cannot undo what I have made my account. Im level 50 with four 6* monsters and I cant clear anything past GB7 and ToAN 45. This was all on me. I didn't really understand what I was doing at the time but now I do. In that time I have also introduced many friends to this game and am sending them on a path to have a much better account than I! For the past month I've been trying to pull myself out of this rut (two of my four 6*'s came from this), but I just cant seem to accomplish it. I really do enjoy this game very much and I strive to become better each day but I've ruined it for myself it seems. I feel like if I had a better account that I could do more with I would be able to enjoy the game and do the things I want to do a lot more efficiently. I appreciate your consideration!",2016-10-03 22:38:40+00:00,d8crhet,1,t3_55pqao,8139,summonerswar
