My new company does not currently offer 401k matching. In speaking to the person we use for our personal investments, advised that I should roll over my current 401k and contribute to a traditional IRA for now, and potentially change to a Roth down the road. Obviously, she benefits from me doing that, assuming I use her, which I probably would, as we are happy with the service she provides. My question is, what are the benefits of the unmatched 401k vs the traditional or Roth IRA? ",personalfinance,401k or IRA,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4t2r2l/401k_or_ira/
