131,"I did another analysis omitting every servant in the game at release, and only counted those added to the game since the start. No this does not count things like Gil, Lancelot, and Euryale as they were in the game but just weren't unlocked yet. So everything from Orion and after. Orion is counted as female because lets face it, Artemis is the one doing all the work, and Astolfo is added to the males for some calculations because ""Le Secret"" is known.

This removes all of the bronze servants(Except Angra) from the equation because lets face it, the game was more predominently male to start, but as everyone knows almost every bronze is male. This captures more of where the game is going as almost every new servant is gold, except for minor characters introduced in each chapter or on rare occasions, a special event.

---


As for how things are going, we have added 75 new servants to the game. Let's break it down by class shall we?

| Class | Male | Female | Total | % Male | 
|:-------|:-----:|:--------:|:-----:|:--------:|
| Saber | 5 | 4 | 9 | 55.56% |
| Archer | 7 | 4 | 11 | 63.64% |
| Lancer | 5 | 6 | 11 | 45.45% |
| Caster | 4 | 10 | 14 | 28.57% |
| Rider |  3(4) | 5 | 9 | 33.33%(44.44%) |
| Assassin | 3 | 7 | 10 | 30% |
| Berserker | 2 | 4 | 6 | 33.33% |
| Other |  3 | 2 | 5 | 60% |
| Total | 32(33) | 42 | 75 | 42.67%(44%)|

&amp;nbsp;

The Parentheses amounts are when we count Astolfo as Male instead of Le Secret. As you can see, things are scewed slightly in favor of females, though its not as bad as I originally thought going into this, with the biggest offender being the Caster class as it has gotten not only the most servants since release, but almost every single one is female. Males have an advantage in the Archer, Other, and surprisingly Saber classes, but they're rather small margins except for Archer where they have a sizable lead of 3.

---

When we look at it again by star ratings, as expected, again things get much worse.

| Class | Stars Male | Stars Female | Avg Male | Avg Female| 
|:-------|:-----:|:--------:|:-----:|:--------:|
| Saber | 18 | 20 | 3.6 | 5 |
| Archer | 26 | 18 | 3.71 | 4.5 |
| Lancer | 19 | 28 | 3.8 | 4.67 |
| Caster | 13 | 43 | 3.25 | 4.3 |
| Rider |  14(18) | 22 | 4.67(4.5) | 4.4 |
| Assassin | 10 | 29 | 3.33 | 4.14 |
| Berserker | 9 | 18 | 4.5 | 4.5 |
| Other |  10 | 9 | 3.33 | 4.5 |
| Total | 119(123) | 187 | 3.72(3.73) | 4.45 |

&amp;nbsp;

Now there are drastic differences in representation here. Almost every single 3 star since the game has released has been Male. Worth note, the only 3 star females added to the game since release are both assassins. (Isn't it sad Hassans?) And they STILL don't bring their class down below the 4.0 mark on average. Meanwhile most classes average males at below 4.0 and only Riders beat females in average star count(Funny enough Astolfo actually hurts their ratio). The Other set does too when not counting Angra though, as they are at 5.0 then. He really kills their ratio. Speaking of Angra, without him, and counting Astolfo, the male total jumps up to an average of 3.84.

The ratio is closer than when we count bronze due to how many males are in the bronze range that it destroys their ratio completely, but even in this constant stream of new gatchas filled with 4 and 5 stars to try and milk us for all of our quartz, the males still come out below gold on average. And it leaves a nice gap of about 0.6 stars in favor of females.",2016-09-03 19:08:32+00:00,d78a1wd,1.0,t3_50zm89,8451.0,grandorder

Attack stats are so close the difference isn't even noticible, I mean really, its not even a difference of 30. Meanwhile LArturia has a good 3000 hp lead, she'll live longer.

LArturia and LAlter gain almost the same NP on their arts cards, LArturia however gains a lot more per hit so she gains plenty more on her quicks which also have an extra hit for more star gen. Her extra also has another hit too. So her NP gain is a lot better overall.

LArturia has a much stronger charisma which not only offsets this issue with their attacks being the same but also makes up for the difference in their prana burst skills for when they NP. It also helps her team more.

LAlter gets one turn of super crits, LArturia can auto-fill half her NP gauge, each has its own uses. LArturia also clears debuffs which can be nice at times but it's honestly negligible. Still there though.

LArturia's NP breaks all evades and invinces, when she NPs, you're getting hit no ifs ands or buts. And it refills itself so she can keep spamming it sooner.

LAlter's has a chance of sealing NP which is nice but unreliable and...curse...woo

This skill on the other hand lets you give the servant protection without feeling you wasted the skill. If they didn't get hit at all, oh well, that just means you're 1 turn closer to being able to reactivate it when the dodge finally does get burned. These skills are ridiculously powerful in that sense and I wish other dodges were a little more like them at times.

George and Leonidas still can do a good job, but imagine how strong they would be with even 3 star stats. Now imagine 4 or 5 star. 

This most recent event has shown that a lot of servants are rather samy. Most only buff themselves to give themselves more damage and a little survivability, and output damage on their NP with minor side effects. Waver was the king of this last event because of how few servants can really play an effective support role(I still say his NP gain buff a while back was a bit too much and now he is rather OP in that sense, not that I'm complaining about having strong servants, it's just there really isn't anyone who can even compete with him at his role now.)

The game feels like a bunch of individually strong units put together to try and form a team, instead of everyone supplying something to complement eachother.

Bring Cu, Iri, and a support that can help Cu survive and/or build NP, Tamamo, Waver, or hell you could bring a damage dealer support and use someone else in the front line.

Try and keep Cu's dodge up, especially when NP is about to fire but work mostly on filling up his NP. With a Kintoki and Ushi CE he should be pulling a few hundred thousand easy, even at level 1 NP. If your support is packing Kintoki, it will do even more, just be sure to use an attack buff on it as well to hit as hard as possible.

If you bring a support damage dealer like Scathach, if they're high enough NP and skill levels and have a limit broken ushi, they can probably 1 shot BP2 ibaraki by themselves.

Robin can also do good damage with his NP if you debuff her first to double the damage, his only downside is he has very little in the way of survivability.

461,"This, due to how crit stars work specifically. Unless they completely overhaul the crit system, two hit quicks are almost useless.

Arts cards are fine though due to having NP per hit multipliers. In fact I prefer my servants being balanced around the NP gain of 1 or 2 hits, because if DW balances their gains around, say, a 5 hit arts(Tamamo that's a 15 NP multiplier right there), they make literally nothing on their busters or quicks no matter how many hits they have.",2016-04-21 17:19:53+00:00,d2bxcay,2.0,t1_d2buzuz,2911.0,grandorder
462,"If you want a basic idea of how much NP an attack generates, a quick has NP gain multiplier of 1 per hit, while arts has 3 per hit. This of course is multiplied by 1.5 if its the second card, and 2 if its the third. This is also further modified if you use an arts card first, which adds a static 1 to each hit.

So lets take MHX for example. Her quick is 4 hits, and her arts is 2. She therefore generates 4 hits x 1 NP multiplier per hit, this gives her an NP multiplier of 4 on her quick. The arts is 2 x 3 for 6. If used later in chains the quick goes from 4 to 6 to 8. The arts, 6 to 9 to 12.

First card art bonus adds 1 though, so Arts technically generates 8 as first for her. If you use quick second and third, they become (1.5 + 1) x 4 = 10, and 14 for third card. While Arts is 11 and 14

Arts first bonus is very effective for those with multiple hits due to the static 1 being applied to every hit.

**TL;DR**  

NP Multiplier for quick cards on MHX: 4 - 6 - 8. With arts first card bonus on 2nd and 3rd, (Arts) - 10 - 14

NP Multiplier for Arts cards on MHX: 8(has to get first card bonus) - 9 - 12, with first card bonus 8 - 11 - 14",2016-04-21 01:30:45+00:00,d2b5jx4,1.0,t3_4fpxrf,11051.0,grandorder

And they'd really want a waveclearer, but for a boss fight situation it doesn't sound THAT bad of a combination.

Mary/Anne is bad at generating stars even with a star rate up skill and 2 quicks, her NP generates a decent amount though. Orion can kinda generate some having 3 hit quicks. Your overall generation will rely heavily on MHX so your crit star amount each turn may be a little lower than one would like. I see the NP chaining being pretty good for Orion though to get some NPs off here and there.

The biggest problem I see is the lack of busters for your damage rounds when the stars are built up. There's not much better than a Buster first card for damage, followed by some quicks to keep the stars flowing. I'd honestly consider bringing Lancer Alter along instead of one of them to provide the power and not decrement your stars too much. You can then switch them in and out according to the enemies you're up against.

532,"It seems to me on average people are trying to make her something she's not. Her baseline comparison is always to Jack as people expect an assassin to generate stars and that's it. While they are the same class and have a similar NP, they still play slightly different. Mostly because of a single card variance in their layout.

I feel MHX shines a little more for teams that focus slightly less on crits, teams that pack a few more arts cards instead so she can arts chain with them. I can see her working well with arts teams as a pocket assassin to kill riders since those kinds of teams are rather caster heavy, and could provide the heals buffs and blocks MHX needs to survive, while at the same time not being a one trick pony as she can still do solid damage to sabers and saberfaces.
She also would provide an aoe stun to give you valuable time to fill NPs, recharge skills, or land a final blow before something kills you. This is not a niche assassins like Jack easily fit into as those teams generate few stars and have low weight so they wouldn't get them anyways.

That being said, I didn't pay for my MHX, and I'm honestly pleased with her. She's not the most OP servant in the game, but she's nowhere near bad.

547,"&gt; Role of the Assassin
&gt; 
&gt; The base role of the assassin is simple – to make stars with their boosted stargen passives and quick orientated decks. 

Except Riders exist so having Assassins that are more usable in comps that AREN'T solely focused on star gen is actually a GOOD thing. Were type advantages not a thing, I'd agree on this point. Admittedly MHX isn't the best example of a universal rider killer since only one saberface is a rider, but if you're running a more general team and want a pocket assassin to kill a pesky rider, MHX might be better for a filler than Jack. Unless it's Marie...then Jack is her bane.

&gt;A problem occurs when you fail to stun 1 or more monster in the wave. The monster gets all the 3 actions allocated to the wave, and is thus still free to wreak havoc on your team

Not true anymore, I don't know when DW changed it, but my MHX has stunned 2 people of 3, and the remaining one only attacked once even if they were of a type that should swing 3 times. 

&gt;The third skill is orion level of niche. Firstly, if you were to encounter sabers, it’ll probably be better to bring an archer 

Oh look, I bring an archer who likes stars, and an assassin who can generate some for them WHILE hitting almost as hard as them. Gee that has some funny synergy. And comparing All sabers to Males only is rather silly. Sabers are everywhere, males are rather limited.

&gt;MHX is a better teamplayer than Jack
&gt;
&gt;No. Jack has better support and team skills. She also fulfils her role as an assassin better (in generating stars). The only advantage MHX might have is the extra A card for Arts chains, and that AOE stun which suffers from RNG and a 1 turn delay

Jack is only a better teamplayer if you team is focused on crits, you're still stuck on assassins have to generate stars or there's no point to bringing one. Her little heal does help some but 2500 every 4 turns is small compared to what 3 attacks can do in a single turn which MHX can shut down entirely, especially so if it holds off an NP long enough to secure a kill. Her buff removal is rather situational(The crit rate reduction is almost a laughable debuff). 

&gt;That’s probably the only advantage MHX’s cardset has over jack, but you’re trying to overplay the effects of one card too much. In your team, okita and drake won’t encounter much problems in charging their NP anyway

You're really only proving the teamplayer point making statements like that. You need a rather exclusive team to fully benefit from Jack. Not everyone has two of Jack Okita and Drake to pull a support for the remaining piece to the puzzle. whereas MHX is more flexible and can help give crits and arts chain to servants that don't generate stupid amounts of NP already.",2016-01-28 20:42:44+00:00,czfjwwk,3.0,t1_czfggfa,4740.0,grandorder
548,"Well, the numbers apply a bit different in those terms. Jack gives her an anti-female buff for 50-100%, which makes her damage 150-200% effectively vs them.

One thing that IS additive though is if her quick buff is up too, it only adds to the anti-female bonus, so say you have 30% quick damage from the quick buff, and 50% from the NP...you only have 180% damage buff instead of multiplying by both 1.3 and 1.5 which is somewhat higher.

Meanwhile the NP for MHX deals 150-200% damage to saberfaces...so it's the same multiplier. Just written differently since MHX only applies for the NP, while Jack gets the buff to all of her attacks for one round.

so it's 2100-2800  vs 2400-3200",2016-01-28 19:52:14+00:00,czfhp23,4.0,t1_czfgh8z,1679.0,grandorder

Like all other NPs that do bonus to things they're super effective against.

Jack's NP is more universally effective, whereas if it's a saberface, MHX is going to hit slightly harder due to higher baseline and because her passive 12% quick buff works on it too. Also MHX's generates a literal crapton of stars since her NP is like 7-8 hits compared to Jack's 5.

612,"For a 3* berserker she does more or less what you want her to do. Her base stats are a little sub-par for a 3* coming up at only about 16000 overall stats compared to most 3*s being around 17000. The worst part being her attack power is a little low for a berserker, which need to kill things fast to survive.

However her job isn't to be your primary damage dealer for a big boss or meaty target. She is a cost effective farmer as she brings a decently strong AoE to the table, and being a berserker with madness EX it's always hitting for about x1.85 before those silly little hidden advantages like sky, man, earth and whatever the heck the other 2 are. Being a 3 star means its rather easy to max the level on it, which means with a K-scope she can quickly and easily waveclear 40ap EXP hands without buffs.

Her NP gain is rather high for a berserker too, gaining about 16 on a third attack arts, even more if it's overkill, and thanks to the quick card buffs her NP gain only got better since her quick now hits twice. You're more or less guranteed to get that 20NP you need to fill up off a K-scope. If you only have a hollowed magic it may take a little longer but it's still doable.

For skills she lacks a bit seeing as she only has 2 available. Her defense buff helps with her naturally higher hp pool to keep her up just a bit longer. A rogue crit usually won't take her out of the game unless she's already taken some pain. Her claim to fame, stalking, provides a bit of utility, upping the whole parties damage vs a single target, which does make up for her lower attack to some degree. It does up their attack power as well, but the goal is to drop them before they get to use their sudden buff. And I don't know of anyone other than Waver who can provide as big of a party-wide damage increase as her, being 24% at max level for 3 turns.

To top it all off, should a kiyohime nuke fail to kill its target, it has a rather decent chance to flat out stun everything it hits, which only goes up if used in an NP chain to seal the deal. There's really not much better than getting a free turn on an enemy. The burn is there too but it really is lackluster due to not really scaling(DW REALLY needs to make things like heals and status effect damage scale better with stats), and the fact that you need 10 whole turns to fully see the effects of it. [Ain'tnobodygottimeforthat.jpg]

And as an added bonus you have the perfect waifu who, as a slight downside, is the epitome of yandere...I mean how many can claim to spontaneously manifest the ability to transform into a DRAGON through sheer rage? Madness EX may not be high enough for her.

The team won't truly shine until you get Liz and Jeannes skills up to a decently high level and you're pumping out nearly 30 stars a turn without trying while the skills are up....having 8 arts cards will make Artemis build NP decently fast even with her poor NP gains so that's good too. 

My only real suggestions would be maybe Hallowed magic for faster NP on Artemis.

Server being down half the time, slow as heck combat with no option to speed it up, quick cards being completely useless, most ascension mats being more or less unattainable(still a good number that are event only, but at least we get those regularly now) causing many servants to be ascension locked while poster children Jeanne and Aturia are able to max ascend straight out of the gate for the whales. Everyone running mass berserkers because honestly bustering through the entire plot was the only way to go. Friends lists full of level 1 Mashus due to extensive numbers of rerollers. Oh, and Kojiro saving France time and time again.

The first month was just a mess.

We've steadily gotten new content, new servants, and new CEs since then. 2x battle speed was a godsend. They've added a lot of little UI features to help inform people better about their options and make things run a little smoother. Quick cards have gotten a rather nice buff, need a little more work, but at least they're usable now. Hell being able to deselect attacks made me happier than it should have. (Now if only we could back out of an attack command completely)

The daily changes were a mixed blessing. It's easier to farm for specific mats on set days, especially with apples to burn now, but a few mats are even harder to farm now what with random spawn rates. I don't think the loss of the EXP daily is that big of a deal. Instead of 30AP for 34k exp, we now have 18AP free missions that give about 12k. It's a decrease sure, but its not that noticeable since you can do it every day and of course, apples.

Gatcha is still nothing but salt and tears, but that's to be expected. At least there's more to pull now than when the game came out and there were a handful of 4/5*s to look forward too.

All in all they still have a ways to go to make this game actually great, but for now it feels a lot more stable, smoother, and fresher than it used to be since we now have more options available to us.

**Looking into the future** - I would love to see some improvements to spawn rates to fix the horrible drop rates of hearts and scales. I also would love to see DW go back and take a hard look at some of the gold servants who just aren't feeling up to snuff. Those that have poor animations for the role they fill, skills that really need more synergy or effectiveness, or even those with NPs that really don't do enough to be worthy of the title Noble Phantasm(Cries over Stheno fitting all three of these aspects). I also feel that some of the servants out there with absolutely no NP gain need a touchup as it's not like their NPs are much more effective than those that can fill up in 2 or 3 turns. Marie, Atalanta, Vlad, and Orion come to mind. 

I'm looking forward to getting more master outfits so we can have more strategy for our team outside of attack buff, heal, and evade. There's lots of versatility that could be added via master buffing to help those servants that are just missing one piece to their puzzle to be exceptionally effective.

Hopefully DW stops making every new 5* a limited time event(Thankfully Jack doesn't seem to be) as that gets tedious especially with how the last few have been back to back.

And finally a couple wishes, we need CE exp to be a constant thing, Honnouji event was rather nice in that regard...as well as items to allow us to upgrade NPs WITHOUT rolling the same person 5 times, at the very least for poor eternally level 1 NP Lily's sake.",2015-12-24 20:05:05+00:00,cyabhr8,1.0,t3_3y3q6d,6488.0,grandorder

Faster NP gain doesn't mean much when he only has 1 arts card anyways. You still basically need a kaleidoscope or they die before charging NP. Darius MIGHT be able to get away with a hollowed magic, but that would require a lot of investment into his golden rule.

776,"Even by DW standards of wanting to make money off this that's just unfeasible.

A 5*CE only gives 15000 and you're not going to roll 10 of those with every 40 quartz spent. CEs level just as fast as servants do. To get to level 100, it would take 17,170,000 exp. That's 1144 5 star CEs worth of exp, you would need more than that if they were lower rarity. 3 stars are 6000, and you'll mostly get those, you'll need 2862 of those to max out the CE.

Since we have 4s and 5s as well, its somewhere between that. Due to rarity probably around the range of 2500 CEs just to max a single other CE. Assuming perfect pulls of only CEs, thats 10,000 quartz, or 700,000 yen. But servants make up 20% of the gacha, meaning you'll need to spend more like 12500 quartz due to 80% of rolls being CE. Or about 882,000 yen.

So ya know...just blow about 7200 dollars every time you wanna max out a CE.

Honestly that's the one biggest problem with this game and building a solid strategy to win a map. Shitty draws, enemies attacking people you don't want them to, lucky crits, these can skew a fight in such a big way between each run.

837,"The main problem with Crit stars as I see it, is that Quick cards are so weak compared to the other types it's not even funny. You give up so much damage compared to a buster in order use a quick card(ALMOST HALF), and if you want any hope of building a decent number of stars without an NP that gives 15+ just for using, you HAVE to quick chain. So no first card buster damage either. You hardly get anything for first card quick(A small increase to the chance of dropping crit stars on every hit? Useful only for really Gilgamesh, and MAYBE those with 3 hit quicks)

And even when you quick chain you get a measely 10 stars...sounds nice at first, but then you realize thats only 22% crit rate for every card if they were dealt evenly. Generally you have somone who can suck them up though so you tend to have 44% or so on a card. But even then that attack's hit or miss on if it crits or not. And you have to quick chain again or your crits vanish for a turn. Good luck drawing 3 quicks every round and always having the person you need critting get a draw or two to use the stars earned last turn.

Honestly at this point I feel an NP team can crit team better by arts chaining an NP that gives up to 25 or more stars and just blowing a boss up with your 77+ crit rate the next turn. And that's just sad.

But the main issue is that why build crit for damage and hope to do solid hits, when you can buster chain and do almost as much as the quick team landing every crit, reliably, every time you draw them, and if you don't get the whole chain you're still vastly outdamaging the dude with quick cards.

Those with 1 hit quick and 1 hit arts I think get slightly more using arts first and quick last. But its hardly noticeable and overkills make arts last better usually. These are your caster animations.

Basically factor in that the base NP value of a servant is applied every ""hit"" and arts cards generate 3x as much NP as a quick card. You also generate more NP the later in the chain you are.

If they have Mad EX, it's actually closer to 1.85x.

Then add in that enemies all have super attacks and noble phantasms that are on a turn based timer, and being able to kill things fast actually PREVENTS damage as you suffer fewer guaranteed kill nukes.

1112,"**Class:** Archer

**Sex:** Male

**True Name:** Odysseus, son of Laërtes and Anticlea, and king of Ithaca. Also referred to as Odysseus the cunning. He was one of the great champions of Greece during the Trojan War and subsequently suffered a long trial on his return trip home, now referred to as the Odyssey.

**Stats:**

Strength - B 

Mana - C

Endurance - B   

Luck - C

Agility - C 

Noble Phantasm - A
		
**Class Skills:**   	

**Magic Resistance** - B
 
Posessing the herb Moly, Odysseus was able to resist the magicks of Circe in order to rescue his transformed men. Cancels spells with a chant below three verses. Even if targeted by High-Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals, it is difficult for him to be affected. 

**Independant Action** - A

Having withstood many great trials mostly by his own wit and will alone, Odysseus is capable of maintaining himself for long periods without the need of his master to sustain him. He can survive for up to one week after the loss of his master.

**Riding** - B

Allows Odysseus to ride most mounts and vehicles with great ease, barring the most mighty of beasts and mythical creatures.

**Personal Skills:** 

**Charisma** - B 

Odysseus ruled over Ithaca, and led the Achaeans through many of the hardships during the Trojan War. He can inspire greatness in those under him, and convince others to act with discretion when necessary.

**Cunning Intellect** - A

Able to quickly adapt on the battlefield, and assess the best tactics for a given situation. Can also read foes and create plans in order to take advantage of them or catch them unaware. 

**Favor of the Gods** - B 
In times of peril, Odysseus can call upon the blessings of Athena to grant him strength and aid him to victory. Strength, agility, and endurance increase, as well as luck, as the gods intervene with anything that may bring Odysseus harm.

**Noble Phantasm:**
 
**The Great Bow of Ulysses** 

Rank: B

Type: Anti-Unit
		
Odysseus's great bow that can only be strung by himself. A mark of the true king of Ithaca needing both great strength and technique to use properly. The weapon possesses great power and can be shot with the precision to pierce 12 axe hafts stood in a row. When activated, this weapon can penetrate some of the mightiest barriers, requiring a Rank of A or higher to repel the attack.

**Curse of Polyphemus - Wrath of Poseidon**

Rank: A

Type: Anti-Army

The final cry from the great cyclops Polyphemus to his father Poseidon. That Odysseus be prevented from ever returning home. And if that wish could not be granted, he would arrive alone, his crew dead, and aboard a stranger's vessel.

Odysseus forms a reality marble trapping himself and his intended targets aboard a vast ship caught within a massive storm. Winds and waves batter those within against the ship and cast them into the sea. Even the most sturdy warrior would have trouble maintaining his composure when faced with these forces as the ship is torn apart. Odysseus himself suffers from the effects as well, but to a diminished amount as he was fated to be the only one allowed to return home alive.",2015-08-19 02:32:39+00:00,cu7tjja,1.0,t3_3hi54k,16137.0,grandorder

In a little over an hour the quests will change to one that gives lots of QP and another that drops exp cards for every servant. Each will have a 10, 20, and 40 ap version.

Tomorrow at about the same time is when it will switch again, those quests will be one that gives master xp, and the other gives servant bond xp. Use the first one to easily level up and refill your AP when you're low.",2015-08-14 13:46:23+00:00,cu2r2t8,5.0,t1_cu2kan3,21919.0,grandorder
