By this I mean the enemies are a lot tankier than most have been in the story missions or previous events, but their damage seems low as well. This is making it less of just berserkering things down in one turn and moving to the next fight, and more being able to pick your moves out a little better.

I've actually been able to charge Marie's NP quite a few times before fighting a boss in my current teams, something that never even comes close to happening during the farmfest that every other map has been. And seeing Kiyohime take 3 or 4 attacks and still not die is nice as well. I'd like to see DW keep doing things like this as I feel we have more options outside of 3 berserker buster chains. Now the only things to work on are the dang NP gauge timers as those are still a guranteed OHKO if you don't kill the boss fast enough, and perhaps buff quick cards so crit star teams don't have to rely on NPs to do anything.",grandorder,This event has surprised me a little,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/3px8tz/this_event_has_surprised_me_a_little/

I got bored and felt the arts first card bonus was really lackluster...and decided to put together a spreadsheet of NP multipliers and added them to the respective attack patterns to see just what is the most optimal way of generating NP for each type. Do note this is the NP multiplier that applies to the servant's base NP per hit multiplier, don't assume just because gilgamesh has a 67.5 in his cell you're going to more than half fill your gauge in a single chain every time.

Now other factors come into play, like if you have an NP gain craft essence on as those apply before card order multipliers I think, or if you crit which is x2, or overkill which adds another 1.5 multiplier to NP gained...but this gives a rather good idea outside of that. And while it does benefit some attack patterns...there are patterns and attack combos it does nothing for.

Not every attack chain is in here, but it has the ones that would have even a chance of outputting the most NP for a given set of cards...and this only adds same pattern attacks together, but that was too much trouble and I just wanted a basic idea how it effects each pattern.

I find it hilarious how QAA actually is about as effective as AQA, and BBA is generally BETTER than ABB. WTF Delight Works.

While I can't say my luck has been bad, (its actually been fairly good given the odds)the fact that I'm not pulling things like double Arturias, or a Joan to carry me all day, has allowed me to appreciate the servants who weren't allowed to have the stats of the more sought after ones.
