* **Increase bitrate** - This can prevent people from viewing your stream without buffering
* **Downscale resolution / decrease FPS** - Decrease the amount of work the encoder has to do.

Mr. Sellers is very much about explaining how to do the work with the tools at hand - how it can be done, and then, how he prefers to do it.   Using the convex jointing technique is great if you have pinch dogs and aren't good enough to consistently do a straight joint.   If you have lots of clamps, the concave technique is also good.  And if you can consistently plane a perfectly flat piece, neither is the best.  Even using the flip technique, you still need to worry about preventing the two boards from going concave/convex.

Still a WIP, I need to build the control panel so I can move liquids around without having to walk to each of the tanks, but the fluid routing is finally complete.
The fluid bus works on your typical vanilla item sorting method - each of the seared gauges holds a fluid and is kept at 15/16ths full at all time. When it fills up, the pumps activate and send it to the requested tank.

Things I've learned working without the more advanced storage mods: Pumps in IE work as connection points between disparate mods. If the pump is acting at the end of a pipe and connecting it to a tinker's tank, it doesn't need power or a redstone signal - it just needs its sides configured, but it does have to be there. If you can't connect a pipe to something - like a smeltery drain, you just need to put a pump between the two.",2016-10-28 16:09:11+00:00,d9bkm6l,1.0,t3_59v8ye,32.0,feedthebeast

78,"I'm a big fan of the ""less efficient"" style of ore processing... I'm also a fan of storing everything as a fluid.  The current setup has room for 27 fluids, but I have room to expand that to 40 total tanks without re-arranging the room.

Still a WIP, I need to build the control panel so I can move liquids around without having to walk to each of the tanks, but the fluid routing is finally complete.  

The fluid bus works on your typical vanilla item sorting method - each of the seared gauges holds a fluid and is kept at 15/16ths full at all time.  When it fills up, the pumps activate and send it to the requested tank.


**/edit:**

Updated with specifics on each of the components.

Things I've learned working without the more advanced storage mods:
Pumps in IE work as connection points between disparate mods.  If the pump is acting at the end of a pipe and connecting it to a tinker's tank, it doesn't need power or a redstone signal - it just needs its sides configured, but it does have to be there.  If you can't connect a pipe to something - like a smeltery drain, you just need to put a pump between the two.

91,"To add to u/rationalparty

To start off: It smells like beef ramen.  If that doesn't bother you, neither will the glue.

One thing not mentioned about hot hide glue is that it tacks almost immediately.  Making large panels is a matter of putting some glue on the joints, rubbing them together, then sitting them aside while the glue cures overnight.  Assuming you jointed the boards properly, that's it - clamps optional.   I often just use pinch dogs so I can move larger pieces around while the glue is drying.

I often keep a little glue bottle of liquid hide glue in my pocket when I working so it's always warm.  As said, for furniture it's the only glue I use.   

You have to keep in mind, if you're building heirloom quality pieces that over time, they might need to be repaired.  The hide glues are reversible, so joints can be taken apart 10, 20, 80 years down the road if needed.  And if you're not making heirloom pieces and realize you screwed something up half-way through assemble... well... also another reason to use them.

Modern wood glues mean that anything you make is intrinsically a disposable item.

276,"Okay, I ws wrong before, that's definitely not mold.

Here are my two new hypothesis: 

1. it might be blue stain - creative name, I know.  But it's a microscopic fungus that can grow in the sapwood of pretty much anything.  It spreads pretty much anytime the moisture content of wood is above 20%.  It is typically not this dark, but it might be interacting with the darkening of the wood which you experienced before it changed.
2.  More likely - You've basically performed a tannin test - simply put FeCl3 when exposed to tannins turns that exact color.  You have no idea what the handle has been exposed to but sesame seeds contain a fair amount of iron and copper, and all it takes to make HCl is NaClO + weak acid.  When you removed the handle from the oil, some of the dissolved salts(most likely in the wood from previous use) began to oxidize and interact with the acids and iron in the oil creating FeCl3.  FeCl3 + tannin is pretty instantaneous and it explains the even coloring.  This could only happen because you used raw sesame oil.  Processed sesame oil has most of the heavy metals removed.

2 is very similar to ebonizing which is done via acetic acid + tannins, but it doesn't result in that color spectrum that one is strictly grey =&gt; black.  Nor would it result in contact discoloration.  As u/Sethmeisterg said, the coloration was just in solution and looks like it wicked into the paper label on the other tool.",2016-08-30 12:55:19+00:00,d72ir82,2.0,t1_d728v3l,28722.0,finishing

My testing methodolgy:

* Anyone on the ground floor of the base just spread out and tried to get spotted.
* Anyone in the spawn zone moved against a far wall and just waited.
* Once a guy got spotted, just immediately ended the turn.
* Got REALLY frustrated every time I tried to use the mousewheel to change view level.

From what I can see, the behavior is exactly as I described it in OXC.  Only soldiers who have been seen are PSI attacked.  The guys up top are never MC'd.

PSI attacks do not require LOS.  I've never argued against that.   What I said is that the soldier needs to have been 'seen' by any of the aliens.   Two soldiers in your save were seen at mission start because that ethereal can see under the hovertank but you can't see around it because it's blocking your view.

Whether a soldier has been seen is saved in the turnssincespotted flag.  It defaults to 255.  If an aliens intelligence stat is &gt; than turnssincespotted then the alien has sight of that soldier.  If **one** alien has sight of that soldier, then **all** aliens have site of that *specific* soldier.  They have squad sight, just like we do.

What they don't have is knowledge of where every soldier is, even for PSI.  This isn't Xenonauts or XCOM 2012.   I promise you, I've done extensive testing of this when I first encountered the Uber Ethereals in FMP.

429,"1.  Keep a couple troops with low psi strength, arm them only with stun rods and smoke grenades, etc - make sure they get seen.  (See #2).  PSI strength of 60 is a good baseline  for your troops.  You're not immune to MC - it's still possible by an ethereal commander, but less likely.
2.  They can only mind control troops they see.  The only way the see your troops include:

  *  They outright see a soldier (obviously)
  *  They mind control a guy and he sees soldiers while controlled.
  *  A soldier shoots at and hits an enemy - even if it's outside of visual range.
  *  It's after turn 20 / there are only two enemies left.

3.   If you don't know your PSI Strength yet - pay attention to troops that get PSI attacked and panic / mind controlled - those are the ones with low strengths - unequip them immediately.

A lot of people think that if they see one soldier, they see them all - like in XCOM 2012, and it can seem that way if they mind control someone before you have a chance to spread out; but I can assure you through excessive testing this is not the case.  I did lots of testing in my last Final Modpack playthrough and it's all recorded.  Once they see a troop, they'll be able to attack him for 8 turns - that's reset every time there's a successful mc, even if he's never seen again.

1. Sand it back down.
2. I like to sand up to 240/320 grit on pine to help close up some pores.
3. Give it a coat of shellac - 1lb cut is good or just just use Zinser Seal Coat that you can find in most big box stores.
4. Light sand again at the highest grit you used in step #2.
5. Stain.
6. If it's not dark enough - another light washcoat of shellac followed by another round of stain.  This is called glazing and allows you to layer the stain without it bleeding out by being re-subjected to the solvents.
7. Varnish, Urethane, Shellac - whatever you have planned for a protective top-coat.

503,"I worked for Sears for 10 years - first job when I was in high school was in the hardware department in their flagship store.  And my mother worked there for 40.

And the one thing that killed Sears - more than the end of the catalogue era, more than Walmart, more than the rise of the internet and general decline of retail.

Sears, as a company, made their employees not want to work for Sears.   

*  Pay continually declined starting in the late 80s - positions where you could once make a comfortable living on commission in the 80s were all minimum wage by the mid 90s.   Managers and Asst managers actually made less and worked more hours if they kept their positions during this transition.  And if you were a store manager - they had you working 90 hours a week, often doing close-open shifts because they wouldn't give you enough budget to fully staff your store.
*  Stores stopped getting updated around this time as well - things like carpets and floor tiles used to be replaced on a five-year cycle to keep things looking clean.  Now you walk into a Sears, and everything is beat up, soiled, and just generally yellow.
*  Not entirely Sears fault - but mega malls - where Sears had invested heavily in real estate also started going decline.  Any anyone who has ever worked retail as a career knows that you often spend your near work hours eating and shopping near your store.  Dead malls are depressing, working 40 hours a week in one is worse.

From my experience - these were the 3 things that really killed it.  When I started there was still pride in working for Sear, especially in Chicago.  The employees were a good mix of kids looking for summer work stocking and facing and young professionals who were passionate about sales and customer service.  When I left, the only employees left were those who were too close to retirement to leave and high school kids who were getting paid minimum wage and putting forth the requisite amount of effort not to get fired.",2016-06-29 04:57:32+00:00,d4s73ot,1.0,t3_4qaiow,42618.0,woodworking

Otherwise my 3 tips to minimize BB damage:

1. Smoke, smoke, smoke - never, ever end a turn where you can see an alien or an alien can see you.
2.  Spread everyone out to minimize BB casualties - this also prevents the aliens from using grenades.  They will not throw a grenade at you if it will only hit one person and they have another weapon to use.
3.  If you see someone with a launcher - move the scout out of range and focus all your fire power on that person.
3.5.  Worst case scenario and you can't kill them - run someone right up into their space, they will try not to attack you if it means killing themselves.

I've lost a number of troops to BBs in my current LP - one of which was at the end of turn 1 into the craft, killing 7 before the mission even properly started, but it hasn't delayed the game progression one bit.

1. Keep the surface wet for several minutes by brushing with oil as you normally would, but continually apply oil to the areas as the wood absorbs it.
2.  Wipe off all the excess oil, return in 30 minutes and wipe off any final seepage.  (follow proper oil-soaked rag disposal procedures)
3.  Let cure overnight in a warm room.
4.  Apply a second coat and while it's still wet, sand with the grain using #600 grit (P1200) wet/dry sandpaper.
5.  Wipe off excess, let cure overnight in a warm room.
6.  Wet sand and dry cycle one more time.

Camber wise, I think my fore plane is around 8"" radius, I just free-hand it, again it's rough work, not really important

I really only use 3 planes - a 4.5, 6, and 7 - and simply because they all have the same blade width, so one cambered blade is all I really need.

And you can tell a scrub plane because the blade is pretty narrow, like 1.5"" with a *major* camber, like 3"" radius or even greater.

You could do it with your jig and a rough stone, but that's a lot of metal to remove by hand.   You won't need a different sized chip breaker - in fact there are only two chip breaker settings that make a difference:  super-tight set, see below, and anything else.  On my #6 it's probably set back 1/8"" just to prevent the large chips from jamming into it.  In a roughing setting, the breaker is really only there to hold the blade in place and provide a bit more stiffness - if you ever pick up a scrub plane, you'll notice they have no breaker.


And when I say super-tight set I mean both - probably no more than 1/32"" - 1/64"" protrusion from the chip breaker and the cut depth is only deep enough to pick up the plane tracks - the shavings are like angel hair and the surface comes out glassy smooth.

&gt;In order to maintain control of the project, I need all game downloads to come from a single central source. I hope you understand.

&gt;What you can do:
&gt;If you change your mind about buying the game within one month, you can get a full refund. I'd like to know why, but it's not a requirement.
&gt;If you've bought the game, you may play around with it and modify it. I'd appreciate it if you didn't use this for griefing, though, and remember not to distribute the changes.
&gt;Any tools you write for the game from scratch belong to you.
&gt;You're free to do whatever you want with screenshots and videos of the game, but don't just rip art resources and pass them around.
&gt;Plugins for the game also belong to you and you can do whatever you want with them, including selling them for money.
&gt;You may sell the game on for any reason if you ever want to. For now, this means selling your account as well.
&gt;Other:

I can promote my company with LEGO blocks if I want - in fact this has gone to court and is perfectly legal. What I *can't* do is try to willfully mislead an audience to think LEGO is affiliated with me; for examply I can not use their logo anywhere in conjunction with mine.  LEGO asks that you don't use it for advertising in its 'fair play' doctrine, but they are powerless to prevent it.

Now, you can prevent such use in your owned servers, but I think that's pretty much where the law will draw a line.

The other question is how long to you own the rights to the things made in minecraft - if I use a self-made texture pack do you still own it?  If I run it through an external renderer, do you still own it?   What exactly are you contending you *own*?  You might own the paintbrush, but you don't own the painting.

Webcams don't do anything for me - I've used them on my streams, and they don't turn me away.

As to the chat overlay - I can tell you why I use one - I multi-stream and I get more views on my archives than I do when live because of the time I have available to stream. And because the games I regularly stream have a much large youtube subscriber base than any of the live platforms.  It allows the users to see what I'm responding to when they watch either off-site or on archive.

668,"Couple of options - for the antique look you want to age the wood - two options:

1. Ammonia fuming - not as bad as it sounds.  Head to an Ace hardware, get some janitorial strength ammonia, then place some test pieces in a bag with the ammonia to fume and see how the color comes out.  You can enhance this process by literally wiping the piece down with a strong tea solution to impart the tannins from the tea into the wood.  But without the tea you're going to get a marked difference between the mahogany with high tannin content compared to the maple.

2. Direct UV exposure - Keep your piece in direct sunlight for a couple days - not my favorite method - takes a long time, possible damage from moving it in and out all the time - freak drizzle can wreak havoc, etc.

Once that's done, finish with amber shellac.   The warm amber will turn the grays from ageing into that deep rich brown you associate with antique mahogany.

/edit: you can also use potassium dichromate to really get a dark mahogany brown, but it's highly toxic and not something that I would recommend as a first project attempt.

If it is solid, or at least engineered, I don't recommend trying to fix individual problem areas.

Any sort of spot refinishing **will** stand out worse than the problem you are trying to fix.

Even if you are to completely refinish the floor, you need to fix the problem with your flooring - namely that it isn't allowed to move with the seasons.   These cracks will just show up again in another couple seasons.  Other than that, you need to humidify in the winter and condition in the summer so that the relative humidity is stable.

792,"I don't understand why you want both.  If you have a true bullet-determination model, you don't need the hit/miss binary system of the current XCOM / Xenonauts.   

Take OpenXCOM for example:


*  Cover works by physically hiding part of your body.  Even though the game is presented in 2-D isometric, the game engine is actually processing the bullet physics in 3-D.  You kneel behind a fence and any bullet that was moving toward the lower half of your body would hit the fence instead (until the fence was destroyed - which could be shot 1 in a 3 round burst with plasma weapons)  Not only does cover work, but simply kneeling in the open makes you a smaller target and thus slightly lowers the chance you'll get hit.   

Now, there are some quirks - no matter how your enemies are covered, everyone aims for the center of the tile where the target is standing / kneeling / whatever.  So if you're facing severely high-accuracy enemies things like trees which only cover about 10% of your profile become better cover than a stone fence that covers the bottom 45% of your body simply because of their orientation.  A more modern approach would be to simply aim at the center of the most exposed part of the alien.  That could lead to some ridiculous ""death by shot toe"" scenarios, but a system with proper wounding could take care of death - body parts: limbs x4, torso, and head.   Any limb shot wouldn't be instantly fatal, but if critical / destroyed could lead to death via bleeding out in 1/3 turns.  Head and Torso criticals could lead to instant death - so given the chance you'd want to peak out to the sides before popping your head over something to take a look, etc. _But now I'm going off on a tangent_


*  You can turn on range-based accuracy for the weapons to allows things like accuracy fall-of for shotgun pellets (but not slugs) and burst fire; and adding minimum range penalties for things like sniper rifles.


* Add your ability to hunker (hide fully behind cover) / peek (expose 10-20% of your body) and it sounds like an almost perfect system.",2016-03-31 12:30:07+00:00,d1kbtpi,,t1_d1jk5lo,56822.0,Xcom

The real reason not to use shellac for heavy use furniture is Alkali cleaning products - anything with ammonia - literally destroy the finish and break it down completely.   Get some windex overspray on a shellac finish and you'll have pits in it immediately.

The other problem is that shellac is extremely hygroscopic - so condensation is pretty killer, but that's why shellac furniture is typically regularly waxed - it helps prevent immediate damage from spilled drinks.  Just gives you that bit of time between spilling a drink and grabbing a towel to clean it up.

However, you need to be specific - there's varnish: which is thinned with mineral spirits (flammable) then there's oil/varnish: which is varnish + mineral spirits + linseed oil (spontaneous combustion hazard)

But a rag soaked in any amount of drying oil can combust and there is no time period, there's too many variables.  Drying oils cure by oxidizing, which is chemically the same reaction as burning something.  Heat is generated and if it can't dissipate, it will cause the rag to ignite, which will then cause the oil to burn, which then leaves a long-burning oil-soaked torch blazing in a corner of your shop.

It's really easy - and I understand the concerns.  Lie-Nielsen saws are _expensive_, get a trainer saw - things to look for when buying old saws:

1.  Rust is fine, pitting is bad
2.  Make sure it has all the saw nuts when you start, finding the right ones can be a pain.
3.  Make sure the saw isn't too use hardened.  If you can look at the saw, you should be able to flex it and it should spring back to true.  When you buy off ebay, broken teeth are a good, but not definite sign.  Teeth either break off because the saw is too hard or if you set them the wrong way when tuning it up.
4.  If you don't want to make a new handle, then make sure that it isn't broken.  A cracked off horn doesn't affect the use of the saw, but a lateral crack down the center will need to be repaired or replaced.",2016-02-01 17:46:11+00:00,czjwqqj,5.0,t1_czjw7zn,739.0,woodworking

5.  If you don't want to make a new tote, make sure that isn't functionally broken.  A chipped horn won't affect useability, but a crack down the center will.

Everything else can be cleaned up - sharpening, jointing, and setting a saw is not difficult.  It might take some practice, but anyone can do it.

1185,"Basically what's happened here is that your original finish was shellac, and it was waxed to help keep it clean.  Over the years, people moved in and tried to update the finish (most likely with ""tung oil"") but they never washed the wood to removed the old wax so you get this cracking.  I had cracking like this almost 1/8"" thick on my stairs when I moved into my house.

You're going to need to wash this first to get all the waxes and dirt off - plain old soapy water, back side of the sponge and some elbow grease.

After that, test again with alcohol to see it it gets tacky - ammonia also works really well, but that literally breaks down the finish rather than dissolving it like alcohol will.  You should be able to remove some shellac _under_ the refinishing mess.

The question is then how much work do you want to do?  The problem is that you want to level the final finish, but you don't want to sand down to bare wood.  It's really hard to match 100 years of oxidation.   My house is a 1910, and this is what I've done:

**I'm not a refinishing expert, But I do know my way around wood finishes.  If I'm doing anything wrong here, please let me know.**

1.  If you want to maintain the original color and keep the 100 year old look, just scrub a bit with alcohol and a kitchen sponge, to even out the cracking.  
2.  Find or mix a stain that is close the the current color, do a wash coat to tint up any exposed wood from step 1.   You can't just use amber shellac because you need to emulate 100 years of dirt to match the rest of the house.  The stain should only soak into any exposed wood and float on top of the old shellac.  Your first coat of varnish, (below) will wipe it off.

If you want to stay 100% true to the original, shellac again.  But I figured if I was already at this point, I might as well give the wood some modern protection.

3.  After that's all done, I use a wiping varnish mix to level without going down to bare wood.   You have two choices - 33/33/33 Spar urethane, BLO, and mineral spirits.  This will provide a softer finish, but it's practically 100% foolproof.  Wipe on, wait 30 minutes, wipe off, wait 24 hours repeat.  This take twice as many coats as the standard wiping varnish, but runs or bubbles are practically impossible.    Or a simple 50/50 spar urethane, mineral spirits mix.  This is a tougher finish and can be applied twice a day to build up coats.   (You can buy your own wiping varnish, but if you're doing a whole house full of trim, you'll save a ton of money making your own)   *I use spar urethane because I don't have AC in my house, so the added flexibility of the spar is helpful*

4.  After 2 coats of the 50/50 or 4 of the oil/varnish mix you can start sanding down and re-applying finish until you've leveled off the high and low points in the wood.  400 grit, being careful around the edges should level everything out after 5-6 coats.

First off - things I like:
Air Game is _great_.  Money Scarcity is well done.  Supression is a very nice addition.


That said:

*  Alien MC is broken and game-breaking.
*  Dread is the worst game mechanic ever made.
*  Even with Predator or Sentinel Armor - there's a 60% percent chance your guys will be one-shot at end-game.  
*  On the other hand, with end-game MAG tech, still takes (on average) 3-5 shots to take down the most common troop.
*  Aliens Camp... like crazy.  Aliens that can't be suppressed + reaction fire from full HP + One shot kills makes the last half of any ground mission pure tedium.
*  Alien AI changes based on your proximity - I know why they did it, but it's still straight up cheating.  And yes, you can exploit it - but that makes the tedium even worse.  You can see how it works pretty much after turn 20 on any terror or base mission.
*  Super-Duper Minor thing: I don't think the devs know what a Carbine is)

**And the most important reason**
(this one will require a bit of text)

The way ballistics work is just broken. In the original X-COM, you shoot a bullet, it will fly in a straight line until it hits something (Wall, scenery, alien, back of your team mate's head) or it goes off the map. It's simple, it worked - your accuracy percentage was your chance to hit a target at 20 tiles, that accuracy determined the size of the cone the bullets leaving your weapon would travel. The game didn't care what you were shooting at, just put the bullets in that cone and they did what they did - whether it was boring a hole through a house or taking down a floater. Here, you have

*  a chance you'll hit the alien (XCOM 2012)
*  a chance to hit anything in the way. (XCOM 94) 

Let's say that you're shooting at an enemy with a LMG. There's a bale of hay between you and the enemy, but you know that your LMG can shoot down that hay bale if you get 2-3 shots into it. So, you force target the alien and the first 3 rounds of your 10 round burst do indeed destroy the obstacle between you and the bad guy. You expect to see the 7 remaining bullets proceed to kill or even just supress the alien on the other side. Unfortunately, the remaining 7 rounds just *poof* disappear, stopping where the hay bale used to be because that chance to hit an alien is determined before the first shot is made. That's the XCOM 2012 binary hit / miss calculation fucking everything up. Even if you have a clear path between you and the alien, the bullet will still disappear at the alien's square and you'll get a *miss* text pop up over the alien's head. It won't continue past them on these occasions, possibly hitting the explosive barrels on the tile directly behind them, just another *poof*. You will never, ever, get a 100% chance to hit something.  That game said you had 95% chance to hit that alien, and even if your bullet had perfect dead-center trajectory, that 5% will kick in and eat that bullet.",2015-12-10 13:23:20+00:00,cxu1g91,3.0,t1_cxtyg3i,10593.0,Xcom

So much of woodworking, at least with handtools, is about body posture and practice that it takes a long time to get perfect.  If your boss is expecting you to be doing journeyman-level work before your hands are a solid callus, that's not on you.  Hell, a couple of months isn't even long enough to have built up the muscles and endurance needed to do this on a full-time basis without fatigue.

Now that I've been doing this for almost a decade - I think 80% of all woodworking is learning to become a good sawyer.  And 80% of being a good sawyer is body positioning.  That's easy enough to practice at home - don't need any fancy tools.  Cheap handsaw, a saw bench, and some construction lumber.  You can just practice cutting to the lines - or work on joints.  When I was learning dovetails, I would spend about 15 minutes every morning, just cutting a couple pins and tails from scrap in the trashbin.",2015-11-19 15:09:52+00:00,cx5qr60,1.0,t3_3tf8qj,11521.0,woodworking
1386,"I'm not going to argue the chemistry of why culinary oils will _always_ go rancid, because I've already done that. 

First off, yes, there are a couple food oils that will not oxygenate - walnut, tung, pecan (I think) and coconut.   The reason we don't use these is because people with bad nut allergies will react to them.  So, it's silly to set up shop and cut out 10-15% of potential customers.

Second, we're talking butcher blocks here.  End-grain, at least 2"" thick.  They are only cutting boards that need to be oiled.   Your typical 18""x24"" x2.5"" butcher block is 8 bdft of wood.  Side-grain blocks can never see oil for their entire lives and be just fine.  They are not fighting seasonal growth.  

So, as far as your comment about 'just over a generation ago': Free standing butcher blocks were kept raw - they didn't need to be oiled for two reasons: 

1. Every piece of wood was dovetailed into it's neighbors
2. Large scale movement was controlled by threaded rods running through the center.

They were also kept clean via _scraping_.  Basically large cabinet scrapers (albeit much less refined) were used to remove the top layers of wood as they got ruined through use.  Commercial butcher shops would go through a block in about 10 years, at that point the top would be so cupped that it was no longer useful as a diss-assembly surface.   Home use just entailed yearly or bi-annual scraping, and tightening the rods every winter.   That said - there was never a time from the invention of the butcher block that mineral oil didn't exist.  You just didn't oil your block because it would interfere with the scraping process.

Modern butcher blocks are just glued laminates and don't have any internal holding mechanisms.  We also don't tend to view these as disposable products.  If we did, people wouldn't spend a couple hundred bucks for a couple square feet of countertop space.  These _have_ to be oiled to keep themselves from tearing apart.  If you use enough oil to keep the block stable, no amount of washing is going to prevent the oil in the center of the wood from going rancid.   Culinary oils go bad from exposure to air - all unsaturated fatty acids do - basic chemistry.  Oil stops water from working its way into the wood, but it doesn't stop air.

And, you can go to _any_ manufacturer or modern block and you'll get the same products being sold - a mineral oil / beeswax oil mix for active cutting surfaces and urethane for countertops.

tl;dr - Washing won't prevent culinary oils from rancidification; butcher blocks must be kept oiled to prolong their life.

When it started to dry out, she started oiling it with olive oil since we always had a bottle near the oven.   After about a year, all the food we started to prepare on it began tasting off.  After 2 years, the kitchen started smelling rank.   I tried taking off a 32nd off the top to fix it, but that was a horrid mess.  

I was able to get rid of most of the smell by hydrolyzing the remaining fatty acids with vinegar, but then we had a cutting board that stank of vinegar.  Better, but not great.  It would up being the smelliest, most expensive kindling I ever bought.

1440,"a bdft is a board foot - a piece of wood 12"" x 12"" x 1"" thick.  Or, 144 cubic inches.

If you want to visualize how big that is - a single 96"" long 2x4 is 3.5 bdft.  (1.5"" x 3.5"" x 96"" = 504 in3) (504 / 144  =  3.5).  Those sell for around $2.50 individually, so when you get hardwood for $1 per bdft, it's hard to turn down.

6/4, 4/4, 12/4 is the thickness of the wood in quarters of an inch as it came out of the mill.  So, if you buy rough lumber, a 12/4 board is going to be 3"" thick in its narrowest part.  When you buy s4s or s2s lumber (surfaced x sides) then it will be a bit thinner.  4/4 s4s lumber will often be around 7/8"" to 3/4"" thick, but it wiill hardly need any work to be furniture ready.  The downside, of course, is that it adds significant cost to the lumber - often $2 to $3 per bdft.

If you go the handplane route - make this bench about crotch height, or hand-hang height.  Makes working those tools much easier - lets you use your legs instead of your arms.

On the opposite wall I'd also setup a rolling cart that you can swap out between router table and miter saw.  and then roll out of the way because behind that, attached to the wall on hinges you'll have a large 4'x4' torsion box that you can drop down for assembly and then lift back up when not in use.

Stored away with your hand tools, you can also make yourself a benchtop moxon vise for joinery work.  Add a couple saw benchs so you can rip rough stock without a table / bandsaw and you're good to go.

They are, however, out of stock of most of their saw files.  But the roll is worth it.  I have one and it's great.

Do NOT buy big box saw files - they often don't even make it through sharpening of a single saw. A _good_ saw file will last around 20 sharpenings, which might be two years if you don't sharpen more than once a month. Everything you want to know about saw files can be found here: http://www.blackburntools.com/blog/concerning-saw-files-which-i-am-now-selling/

Hand Saws - if you're interested you can make a very nice backsaw using the stuff available at blackburntools - but for modern saws I can not recommend http://www.badaxetoolworks.com/ enough.  None of the modern makers even come close and I've spent way too much money on Lie-Nielsen and Veritas saws.  That said - you also want a 28"" rip saw, filed between 4-6 tpi for rough dimensioning.  Those you can find on ebay.  Look for a saw without too many broken teeth and with a fully intact handle and all its saw nuts.   Too many broken teeth typically means that the saw has age hardened (many of these saws will be 100 years old) - and broken handles just save you time and effort.  I like my saws to be pre-WW1 - the steel was better and they hadn't started fgoing cheap on the handles yet.  Don't worry about surface rust - it's often hard to tell, but you can always ask if the saw is pitted at all.  And don't spend more than $50.

I personally like Disston D8 saws with the extra thumbhole for ripping work, but those tend to be more expensive.  On ebay you will often be battling the collectors, so leave their shiny, fully restored saws with perfect civil war etching to them and get yourself a workhorse.

Saw sets are a dime a dozen nowadays - if you go to any sort of swap meet. They're usually in a bucket for a couple bucks each.  On ebay people think they're made out of liquid gold.  You can get them new here for https://www.toolsforworkingwood.com/store/item/MS-SAWSET.XX/Saw_Sets - and that's a nice set because it has a fine and normal set.   

Unless you're cutting green wood, the set should just be wide enough to keep the saw from binding.  In a dovetail saw it's almost non-existant.  On your 4.5 tpi rip saw, it's going to be pretty pronounced.   When you do set an old saw, never set an old tooth in the opposite direction it was originally set - that's the #1, 2, 3, and 5th reason that saw teeth break off.

And, finally, make a saw jointer - piece of wood as long as your mill file with a 1/4"" groove (or couple runs through a table saw if you have one) and a wooden wedge.  Don't spend any money on buying a manufactured one.  This one is even fancier than mine with its shiny screw http://www.galoototron.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/saw_jointer.jpg

1652,"Same reason old wood boats didn't need to be finished - tight fitting joints to push together when the wood gets wet.  No glue, but metal bands (in the case of barrels) or floating pinned tenons (in the case of viking ships).

Edit:  wrote that in a hurry - to further explain.

That way water travel through wood is along the length of the fibers - cross grain water movement is is minimal, you only lose moisture due osmotic pressure caused by evaporation on the exterior of the barrel (that's the Angel's share).

When you make a barrel or a boat, the first thing you do is fill it with water, and then watch it flow out like a soaker hose.  But you keep filling it with water until the wood has fully saturated and the joint compression kicks in - this will take a couple days to a week depending on the size.  After this point, any imperfections in the joints will get wax (or pitch) rubbed into them.  The higher quality the work, the less you need to do this.  Now, the only requirement is that the wood stays wet, all the time.  Modern day coopers will take their freshly soaked barrels and then shrink wrap them individually for shipment to keep them from drying out.  These joints always fail at the point where air and water meet: wooden boats _always_ rot at the water line, and dried out barrels can rarely be re-used.

If you make something like this as a mug, your biggest enemy is going to be keeping the wood wet - you can't just keep the mug full of water 24/7 because that would be impractical - what you want to do is basically keep the wood fully saturated with mineral oil.   For something like this, I'd fill it with oil until the wood weeps every day for two weeks, letting it air out overnight - then repeat this every week for two months - then repeat every month for the life of the mug.  You can buy bulk mineral oil at places like farm &amp; fleet as horse laxative, or something along those lines.

Never, ever wash with soap, and never allow the wood to even look dry and you'll be good to go.",2015-09-28 14:29:42+00:00,cvgw1j5,1.0,t3_3mp70l,2272.0,woodworking

All he said was that any sort of deflection is bad when you're making furniture and and I quote:
&gt;That said, the amount of yielding before failure of a screw joint does give it a certain amount of toughness. Failure is gradual, and it takes a lot of energy to get a joint to let go. This means whatever you fasten with screws takes a lot of beating before it fully comes apart. This property is useful if you are building sawhorses, scaffolding, or packing crates. But for furniture making, it doesn't help much. So my conclusion is that for furniture applications where strength is critical, screw joints should be avoided. That said, it's fine to use screws to attach a panel to the back of a dresser or bottom of a box, but you shouldn't rely on screws to hold a chair frame together.

1724,"Some good advice has already been given,  I'll tell you how I have always done it - 

The first thing to remember is that this is timed - so before you assault their base make sure you've taken the time to have a a full roster of Colonels.  Yoiu are in no rush.  Unlike LW, You have all the time in the world to fully kit them out with the best gear possible.  There's nothing stopping you from having literally everything but PSI researched before you assault the enemy base.  Remember that your unit list is sorted by rank -&gt; kills -&gt; missions.  Use that to your advantage if you want specifc troops to show up.  A support mech to boost everyone's defense for the first couple waves can be a life saver.

That said, I run everyone upstairs and unlike @drachenmaul I have them facing away from the mech bay.  I place the blue shirt rookies nearest the openings on the second floor that lead to the mech bay as bait.

You should be able to take out the initial hologlobe enemies and the flight guys without having to move too much - just moving to fresh cover as it gets destroyed.  You'll have a couple of the mec bay enemies come in as you're cleaning up the air wave, but with your bait, you should be able to handle them one at a time, no problem.

Once the air wave is destroyed, you move just through those openings onto the balcony in the mec bay.  Run a mimetic skin troop up where he has good visibility of the enemies entering the mec bay and just park him there.   Make sure to hunker him at the end of every turn so that he doesn't overwatch fire / CCS and use him to point out targets to your Squad sight snipers.

Remember, in vanilla you dictate when the base defense happens, and once you reach october before you assault the alien base, might as well wait until your fully teched up.",2015-07-28 02:03:13+00:00,ctiihwa,1.0,t3_3esvhx,26676.0,Xcom
