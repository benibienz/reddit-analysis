I have this problem using the pumps to pick up lava and before I file a bug report on th issue tracker I wanted to see if I was missing anything.

On the surface it works perfectly fine: http://i.imgur.com/ic9i2cA.png

Yet when I set up the exact same system underground (on a much larger lava lake), nothing happens:

I am thinking about expanding my current gaming stream into the creative realm by bringing a camera into my woodshop.

I currently have a spare c920, and want to mount it to the ceiling so I can shoot straight down onto my bench, but the bench is built into the wall and any work I do on it invariably shakes the camera.

I'm looking for recommendations for a shockmount that would work for the c920 or even a camera with some rudimentary IS built in.  It's nothing huge, just the sort of tremors that are really, really annoying on a stream.",Twitch,looking for advice about camera shockmounts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/52kxv4/looking_for_advice_about_camera_shockmounts/

I do have an HVLP system, so that's not a problem.

Should I get a white lacquer primer and do top gloss top coats - or should I use a product like the Valspar white pre-cat lacquer - the closest dealer of which is about 40 minutes from my shop.

I'm truly at a loss.  Painting is really not my forte.  I know pre-catalyzed lacquers have a short shelf-life, but I have no problem wasting a gallon on a relatively small project + learning.

I know there are a number of us who use Joicaster to multi-stream because it has some very nice features like it's chat aggregator and the scheduling service.  Unfortunately as useful as that chat it is, it never really worked right in stream overlays because of how complex it was - you often had to use window capture with 4-7 filters to crop and remove the background gradients.

I've spent the last couple hours modifying their css to use with your browser plugin on your streaming software.  I can only speak to how this works on OBS Studio, but it shouldn't be any different elsewhere.

Paste this CSS into the browser plugin window:
http://pastebin.com/mcFSJGk0

This removes the chat / users / settings tab on the top and the buttons / chat entry on the bottom as well as making the background 100% transparent.

*  If you want to change font-size / weight do it in the body section @ line 236.
*  If you want to remove timestamps, add &gt; display: none; in the block @ line 5665

The only thing I have to do now when I start up obs is ""interact"" with the browser source and delete the ""System Notice"" line that always shows up when you load the chat window.",hitbox,Modified CSS to use Joicaster's Chat in a CLR plugin,https://www.reddit.com/r/hitbox/comments/4bzamf/modified_css_to_use_joicasters_chat_in_a_clr/
