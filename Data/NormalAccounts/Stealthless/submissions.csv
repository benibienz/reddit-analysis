From what I've heard, TCPi made the new ones to prevent scalers from weighing packs. The new ones would weigh **slightly** heavier than the classic code cards and get packaged with the packs containing non-holo rares. 

Whereas the classic code cards would be packaged with the packs containing a Holo/EX.

I created my YouTube channel back in 2011 named SteaIthIess. **Note that I replaced every ""L"" with a capital ""i.""** Ever since YouTube allowed people to change their channel names via Google+ (back in 2014?), I properly renamed my channel Stealthless (both lowercase L this time). 

I put a significant amount of time and effort into my content and have 545 uploads on the channel. I'm not pleased with where I currently am right now as I have 15,000 subscribers. I have the feeling that the username ""Steaithiess"" limits my channel's exposure because normally, people would type in Stealthless (both Ls and not capital ""i"")

**So my question is** did my initially selected username screwed me over for the first few years?

(Major League Pack Battles) In the MLPB, we have 16 teams facing each other weekly in head-to-head matchups! If you're into Pokemon TCG pack battles and love spectating teams in leagues then the MLPB is perfect for you! We're aware that the MLPB is all luck-based, but it's still fun to make a league based around Pokemon pack battles.

**The MLPB is officially sponsored by ThePokeCapital.com!**

I'm making this post to inform you that our league is about to head into the Playoffs phase! I should've posted this way **before** the MLPB season started but I forgot! Anyways, we're heading into Week 8 (final week) of the MLPB regular season and there are currently **five** playoff spots left!

Since I'm making this post so late, I will **NOT** be posting the standings for the sake of spoilers. If you want the standings, check the link below.

If you have **Twitter**, definitely Follow the [MLPB Twitter account](https://twitter.com/OfficialMLPB) because it's **ALWAYS** active, providing match previews, current standings, team logos, and more!

If you want full details on how the MLPB rules and scoring works, watch this short intro video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So6gUYzYMVE
