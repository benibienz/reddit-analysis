0,"There aren't many jobs like that in the industry. A commercial firm is usually all brokers and maybe a marketing team. The brokers do the research, underwriting, and development for themselves. Even if a company did have a position like that the pay would be low and you would get bored really fast. My advice would be to get your license and try to learn as much as you can about the industry such as terms and common practices and then start reaching out to firms that interest you.

1,Be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to it. If your looking for a 9-5 this is not the career for you. Get familiar with cap rates and pro forma incomes and start researching the market you want to work in. Look at rental rates and $/sf too. Its all about networking and hitting the phones.,2016-11-15 00:48:14+00:00,da0lv24,1.0,t3_5cu2cb,74418.0,CommercialRealEstate
