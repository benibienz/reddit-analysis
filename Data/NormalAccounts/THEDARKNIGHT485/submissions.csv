It seems like a lot of people are making a new account for the MMR reset, since Blizzard wont do a full reset. This actually works out in Blizzard's favor since now you have additional accounts and might spend some money on a stim pack to get that account leveled up faster. So, why would Blizzard reset MMRs when they can actually make more money off people starting new accounts and spending money on stims and heroes they already own? I'm sure a lot of people smurf without spending any money, but for all the ones that do, it makes sense for Blizz to let that practice continue.
