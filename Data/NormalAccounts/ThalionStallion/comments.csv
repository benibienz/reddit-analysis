4,"This is definitely a thing I experienced and it aggravated me a bit (mainly because I tend to think of being energetic as one of the better points of my videos). When I realized it was happening, I downloaded one of the affected videos off of Youtube to compare audio levels.

YouTube apparently has an issue with loudness from what I've read. The video I pulled from YouTube had my voice roughly at 3 dB lower than the video I had uploaded. Ever since, I make sure to turn up my mic audio 2.5-3 dB higher before exporting the video.

So I would recommended doing the same - downloading, comparing the audio levels, and adjusting it for the difference.",2016-09-04 23:43:09+00:00,d79ny0m,1.0,t3_5107xc,103530.0,letsplay

6,"With regards to using VidIQ to judge how much a game is searched, what would you consider to be a healthy rating in VidIQ's ""search volume"" field? I noticed that the current ""Human Fall Flat"" term has a Search Volume of 2 and Competition of 34. That seems really disproportionate (of course, I imagine those numbers were different when you started your coop videos).

Similarly though, I checked ""undertale fangame"" and it gets a Search Volume of 8, which seems relatively low for something I know to be a popular search. ""undertale gameplay"" nets 20.

12,"When I realize a series is not doing well, I evaluate it on a case-by-case basis.

If it is a story driven series (like my SOMA series) and I am enjoying it, I will usually extend the episodes to be around 45 minutes to still play through the game but at a much faster pace. This isn't the most digestible length for a video but there are three factors playing into it:

1) I want to play the game really badly

2) There are at least some people on the channel enjoying the series and possible future audiences that will enjoy the series and I don't want to leave that experience half-baked

3) There is also a group on the channel that clearly don't care for the series and I don't want to alienate them as much as possible. My channel has variety and I feel that's one of the strengths

The method of extending the episodes to spend less total videos on the game but still seeing it through seems is the best compromise I've come up with so far. I don't want to stop playing a game I'm having fun with, break the trust of the people invested in the series, or alienate those not into that particular series.

I really like the premise of this video with playing characters counter-intuitively (dat offense Mercy).

That's because she's bad at the game.""), which makes the moments where you get really energetic and excited a bit unexpected and really enjoyable.

As far as your commentary, you have some really solid lines (""No no no no. Fuck you, Lucio!"", ""...Fuck you. *hit* heh. *hit again* heh!"", ""That's a unique joke"") with some good timing. Some of your stuff falls flat though (a specific example is that time where you said ""Look at [insert here, sometimes just ""that""]"" a lot in a row).

Your mic seems to make your voice sound flatter than I think it actually is, rather than really deliver the changes in your speaking. 

I think the battles serve as a good platform for you to tell your stories and you do that well; if you are in an area for a while with the same enemies and don't have a story to tell/thought to finish, I would cut the battles. This is especially true for your shorter video format, I think. Side Note: I think a softer kind of cut might be good for that.

Pros: The biggest pro is that I feel like I have a direct connection with my viewers when I commentate, and that lets me communicate with facial expressions (especially if I make really stupid innuendos). It also gives me a focal point for my commentary, as if I'm chatting with someone in the room. Finally, I just think it lets me do neat things and lets people get to know me as me.

Cons: It does up render time quite a bit, especially since I do 1080p60fps on my facecam. Also (and this might just be me) I get super paranoid about the camera shifting and bumping and rearranging. I am constantly trying to ensure that it is consistent. Finally, it may make one a bit more self-conscious about your mic. For example, I dislike having my mic in the facecam and it has actually made me hesitate on getting a proper pop filter.

49,"Hey there! My name's Thalion, and I have a small channel that started up a few months ago.  Let's Plays were something I discovered by watching the bigger YouTubers like Markiplier and Jacksepticeye. It started out as some really fun entertainment, but the more I watched, the more I saw the good they were doing within their communities. They started enriching the lives of all their viewers, working to support charities, and spreading general goodwill and fun. That really touched me.

So, fast forward a few months after that, I started my own channel. It looked like it would be a lot of fun, and I thought maybe I could enjoy it as a hobby. As I did it more and more, I came to love the entire process - commentating, editing, and (most importantly) interacting with the small community that has started to sorta develop on my channel. We're still a small channel, but there's nothing better in the world than knowing you're able to brighten someone's day with a silly video that you made.

As for me personally, I feel the happiest when I'm working on the YouTube channel. Making videos has become a serious passion for me, and I'm constantly trying to improve my commentary, my editing, and my ways of connecting with the people watching. It's fulfilling in the weirdest and funnest sort of way.

56,This is absolutely fantastic. This has always appeared to me to be one of the more ridiculous issues with YouTube's policies since it was so easy to abuse. I'm really excited to see Youtube starting to step up their game.,2016-04-29 00:14:27+00:00,d2lf2cl,1.0,t3_4guyhh,25722.0,letsplay

58,"This has been my philosophy as I've started my channel and I feel it has served as a great encouragement.

Infinite attempts will eventually lead to a success. The most important thing in the meantime is therefore making sure you do your best to improve your craft and do what you love to sustain that dive into rolling the dice.",2016-03-29 02:07:52+00:00,d1h653i,2.0,t1_d1gs1ir,20548.0,letsplay

60,Kinda a chill day today; rewatching One Heart Heroes play [Super Mario World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xuxook4EVyE) and [Yoshi's Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMROmuI_gwc). Something really nice about watching retro games while waiting for videos to render.,2016-03-17 00:21:22+00:00,d12of2s,1.0,t3_4amcbs,69553.0,letsplay
61,"I finally got the chance to properly start my short series on The Guest while finishing up Firewatch, which has been really fulfilling. Also, I've had the chance to play around a lot with Dynamic Processing in Audition - a very exciting experience.

Goal for next week: manage to get ahead of the curve on my editing instead of doing it super late at night!

EDIT: How could I forget my biggest accomplishment of the week? I managed to believably (sorta) chop off my fingers in a thumbnail! ",2016-03-15 04:17:35+00:00,d109pln,1.0,t3_4abrru,83725.0,letsplay

69,"This is such a cool idea! It should really help smaller channels get good exposure, which is always excellent for morale.

I recently started a playthough of Among The Sleep, an indie horror game.  This is the first episode, which I would like to submit: https://youtu.be/1Xmb4CDXSgo

I look forward to seeing other people's videos here!",2016-01-20 03:18:17+00:00,cz4s6or,1.0,t3_41k139,120575.0,SmallYTChannel
