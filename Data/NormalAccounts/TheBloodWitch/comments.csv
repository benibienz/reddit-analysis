0,"I died twice on the operating table when I was 8, I was having a tonsillectomy. I don't honestly remember much about it, there was a prolonged period of darkness while I was under, but other wise I had no idea I had died, no single thought, no noise. Just darkness, like I was asleep and not dreaming. I remember it going something like this:

I was wheeled into the operating room, the anisthetic technician placed the mask over my face, told me he was going to punch the balloon(don't remember what it was exactly) while I counted backwards from ten until I fell asleep, was asleep before I even got past seven. Then just darkness, abrupt black darkness. If I had to count for how long it lasted I would say at least two to three minutes, it was obviously a lot longer than dreaming feels like. And then I woke up in the hospital room to them offering me ice cream.

I was told I died for a combined period of 40-45 minutes, the surgeon had given up on me, but my mother, who worked for the hospital at the time, and had demanded to be in the or with me worked on me until she got me back. She wasn't letting her daughter die that day.",2016-11-09 21:48:19+00:00,d9tfn5a,1.0,t3_5c3k40,4159.0,AskReddit

80,"You are quite correct in your assumption that the abuse was one sided. I was never much of a trouble maker in my family when I was very young, I was on the quiet side, read books, and mostly kept to myself, my toys, or hung around with my friends. But...one of the earliest memories I have is of my brother coming to me, with a pair of scissors and telling me ""You have gum in your hair"", and proceeding to chop hair off at will, I don't think mom ever punished him for that, and instead scolded me for believing him in the first place. Years later he tried to light my whole head on fire in an 'experiment' on human hair+fire. I never once did anything to warrant his abuse, he just decided that I was to be bullied, I never retaliated, and I couldn't even stand up for myself, I was very fraile and sickly as a child...so I was pretty weak, still am, with little to no upper body strength at all. Sorry, that became more of a rant than anything...but yeah, one sided... My therapist once said she believes that a good majority of my anxiety, depression, and self esteem issues stem from the problems with my brother, from my childhood to now.",2016-07-27 10:29:14+00:00,d5ss60i,7.0,t1_d5shj6g,26323.0,AskReddit
81,"I've had many friends with male siblings. None of them have called their sisters a fat ass, punching, slapping, throwing them around, pulling their hair, and slamming them into items well into their early adult hood like my brother has done. The term ""boys will be boys"" is an entire false phrase. Gender has nothing to do with how a child acts, it's all about how they are raised and disciplined. Certainly didn't help any that he got babied the most, got everything HE wanted, got to do everything HE wanted, while I was ignored.

By the way, he's 20, and I'm 21, he still continues to bully me and act like a child because he holds the most ridiculous grudges against people. He never had an excuse as a child, he just did it because he wanted to, he didn't care if I was in pain, he would yell at ME for getting him in trouble if I yelled to mom, he would try to scream over me if I was yelling for help, and make fun of me for being a 'baby' for going to mom instead of retaliating. Now the reason he still bullies me well into adulthood? The reason he, at 6'4"" tall, weighing 380 pounds bullies 5'3"" 190 pound me? Because I threw a book at him one time.

So to answer your question. No, I don't expect my siblings to act like angels all the time towards me, but I do at least expect them to grow up and stop acting like they're still a child, and thinking that the saying ""boys will be boys"" still holds any meaning now that they're an adult, and realizing that *maybe*, just *maybe* continuing to bully someone for practically no reason, is a stupid thing to do.",2016-07-27 10:13:48+00:00,d5srw18,6.0,t1_d5rnbhw,63918.0,AskReddit

172,"Despite what people think, demisexual isn't just ""the norm"". It's denouncing so many things just to say that...so keep it in mind.

Demisexual heteromantic means that I can not find people more than just physically attractive unless I am very romantically and emotionally linked to them, it takes me ages to feel comfortable enough to get to the point with someone where I'm finally like ""okay I **think** I can have sex with you now."" Because I want to know, and be sure that they have the same feelings that I feel for them, before I do something that I consider very intimate with them. Heteromantic means that I am only interested in having a romantic relationship with men ONLY. If you wanted to think of it in a non-lgbta sense...it would be ""Conservative/prude straight girlfriend"" even with how wrong that actually is.

546,"Plays-The Secret  World
It's pretty much an mmo, and made by EA, but it's not play to win! The only reason it's associated with EA is because the developers are owned by EA. There are three playable factions. Templars, who are the old school defenders of the world, seeking out a new world order to better the earth. Then there's the Illuminati, only as old as America is, but they are the rivals of the Templars, they are more secretive and constantly hide things from the whole world, their motto is more ""shoot first, ask questions later. The Dragon is our final faction, Asian born bred and raised, they're about sitting back and watching the illuminati and Templars rip each other's throats out, but they'll get involved in a fight if they have to. There are nine powers/weapons to choose from . Elemental magic, which isn't as old as one might think, more of a new age modern power, perfect for fire and electricity. Blood magic is as old as the Earth is, weapon of choice to get things done in a hurry, but be warned, do it too much and too often and you find your health slipping. Chaos magic is the oldest, it's strength coming from space and time itself, for as long as there is chaos, this magic will prevail. Three melee weapons, there is the old and ever trust ful fist, fight with your fist, speak with it, do as you want, if this is your chosen weapon of choice, it will never fail you. The hammer, blunt strong and hardy, always willing to go into a fight, bring it down upon your foes, show them you mean business. The sword, an age old classic, the sword is always graceful and strong, it is only as strong as it's user is however, will this classic aid you or be your fall? Then there is the three ranged, and we ain't talking no namby pamby bows, these are guns son! The pistol, light and easily concealed, they are among the easiest for someone to pick up, bringing the pain to show good things do come in small packages. Assault rifle is next, best used far off if you're not the kind to want to get in the thick of the action, that's alright, everyone has their reasons, always accurate and always packing a punch, it is perfect for those snipers in the making. Then there's the bitch, the almighty boss, yes, we are talking about the shotgun! Heavy, big, and bold, it is the perfect weapon to get up close and shoot someone's head off with! While it has a few draw backs, the pros outweight them by miles. You can choose two to go with, mix and match as you please, because unlike other mmos, while you're stuck in your faction, you're never stuck with your starting weapons, tired of pistols? Well grab a shot gun or an assault rifle, want to do both fist and sword? Well alright, do as you please, but remember, always keep it a secret, in The Secret World. Edit: whoops, might of gone a bit over board.

Think about it this way: intersex beings exist in the world, they can either be sterile or fertile, for this theory we'll be talking about the fertile kind.

Because the sperm cell and egg both hold the same DNA, as such the body would get confused, the egg would be inviable, and expelled at next moment when possible. Now, true asexual species exist in the world that can impregnate themselves, but most if not all mammals are unable to do such.
