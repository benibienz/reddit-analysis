* Fatigue

If anyone has anything else they would think could be good to include, please comment below.
Things I am considering

* Nausea
* Increased hygiene decay
* Menopause mod for elders

This of course would be set to only be enabled on sims who have chosen 'able to get pregnant'
It will start however in teenagehood and end at elderhood.
There will also be four time lengths, for the aging duration of the sims 4, but chooseable by user

Age: 2-3 years of age

Sex/Neuter status: Spayed female

Breed: Unknown, personal belief to be Norwegian forest cat

Body weight: Low, but will regain.

History: Just got her last week, came from a home where her litter mates picked on her i.e. pulling fur, chasing from food, fighting without play, she is low weight and skinny but it is not the problem currently as she is single cat in house here and will have no problem getting food if she needs it.

Clinical signs: She seems to have a bit of an issue with her left eye, she can see out of it, but keeps it half-closed, there was a small bit of mucus around it, and I can't see any other problem with it. Should I be worried? Is there anything I can do at the time being to help her?

My basic idea would be it starts after the female sim becomes a teenager, a little pop up basically saying 'Now that Sue Sim has become a teenager, she'll have an extra visitor every x days.' X days being tune-able maybe? So people can choose how long they want their female sims to have periods, could even be altered to match life spans as shown below.

Teen

* Short 1 days
*  Medium 2 days
* Normal 3 days
* Long 4 days
* Epic 5 days (I personally play on epic at maximum slider)

Young Adult

* Short 2
* Medium 3
* Normal 4
* Long 5
* Epic 6

With adult stage going back to the teenage span.
There would of course preferably be a weeks pause between periods to allow for sims to get pregnant if they want ;) and when they do become pregnant(play best with no-baby jingle for surprises!) a pop up can say 'Sue Sim has missed her period! She's pregnant!'

I was thinking that some sims can experience things like cramps, munchies, and fatigue, like real life women do, for cramps you can use the kicked moodlet(looks like someone clutching their stomach from cramps!) combined with the labor animation, with the moodlet reading something like 'Sometimes being a woman hurts! These cramps are killer, better go relax.' For -15 or -20 and between 30 minutes to an hour. Munchies and fatigue can speak for themselves on what to do with them ;).
An interaction on the toilet for women only who are experience their periods would be 'change pad' or 'change tampon'. And perhaps either a grungy or toilet moodlet to warn them to change themself before they get smelly!

I'm so bored with life right now, there's nothing else I feel I can do...I'm scared, because I don't want to miss how everything turns out, but at the same time...I don't want to keep waiting only to have my heart keep getting destroyed over and over again. There's only so much pain a person can take.

The point is, I can't handle this anymore, good karma comes around they say right? I keep putting our good karma, I'm kind, I always help, I always try to smile so others can smile too. Of good karma is supposed to come around...why hasn't it come back for me yet? Am I being punished for something? Am I being punished for being selfish? Selfish for just maybe...for just wanting something to go my way?

Is it easier to not care for others outside of your friends? Is it easier to just become cold and with drawn just so I can be sure my heart won't get injured again?

I... don't want to be that way, I like the way I am, I like the person I am.
But... at the same time, I hate the way I am, I hate the person I am.
I don't want to care anymore, I don't want to be scared anymore.
I wish I could pull that trigger, take that leap... I want to stop crying all the time, I want to stop letting myself get hurt so much.

They say it all works out in the end... that pain is just what we have to go through before that next chapter in our life. Well tell me...when will this 5 year long chapter of pain stop?

I don't want you in my life anymore, I wish you would go away. I wish you would let go of me. Leave me alone, I don't want you here anymore, you make everyone hate me, you make everyone pity me. I don't want this. I don't want any of this.

Anyways the episode I remember briefly I think shows a woman and her husband, I think, in a house, but the woman is paralyzed? and holding some sort of device, maybe a tracker or gps, but something on it had made her paralyzed or motionless, as she's just staring at it and doing nothing else. Her husband is taking care of her, feeding her etc. I'd like to know if anyone knows what anime this is.",Animesuggest,I need help figuring out this anime.,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/3ahdji/i_need_help_figuring_out_this_anime/
