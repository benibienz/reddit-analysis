0,Banning attribute cards is a dumb idea. You say its unfair for people who use them vs people who don't. Well in that case lets ban ronaldo because personally I don't use him (and couldn't even if i wanted too :( ) if people want to use the cards let them use the coins. I wish they could implement a system where EA could somehow track the amount of coins in your account (coins + what your team cost you to buy) and try their best to match you up with someone who has a similar value if thats at all possible. And there isn't really a way around this because if you want a great team buy one and play people with one and you cant have like 500k and try play with a 10k team to avoid god squads because it takes your coins into consideration. People also couldn't really purposely keep having no coins to play against people who might be worse because if they get like 30 wins they would need to get rid of 100k from wednesday night very late before friday morning ,2016-11-21 10:36:19+00:00,da9d532,1.0,t3_5e2d6d,19665.0,FIFA

What I did was started watching some youtubers who I enjoyed and thought were pretty good, which for me was Cookieboy. From him I learned how to user other players than my D line and that immediately made my defense 10x better. Then just from practicing plays I was able to start making better reads, I was able to read the defense pre snap, and started to gain some actual knowledge of the sport and that helped a little bit too although a lot of what should work in the game from real life actually doesn't most of the time lol.

Like if you're big on chem and say you have tier 2 3-4 chem, but you see a new middle linebacker you want really bad who has Tackle Master. Then you buy him and take out your MLB and degrade to tier 1 3-4 and now you decide you know what I'm gonna get a ROLB with Tackle master to boost my MLB so you do that aswell.

Especially the way it's being talked about here. Because there is literally no Linebackers or D linemen to my knowledge that are as fast as running backs and we've all seen running backs get chased down by them in real life so how is that fair ? Running backs for the most part aren't really all that much faster than these guys. Maybe in a straight line.

But how about you look at that in reverse and go if you take the probably 20-30 hours grinding that it would take to open the expensive packs and then say you don't grind and get a job instead, that's 30 hours by at least minimum wage which is 30 x 7.25 in America I believe which is $217 which is essentially what you are buying the packs for and you have a little bit left over ( in fact you'll most likely be getting paid over minimum and have a good bit left over) and also another argument you didn't address was that some people who open packs actually just love opening packs.

Basically saying that a competitive game that actually has leaderboards that matter at certain parts of the game should essentially be way more pay to win. And if they increased pack odds elites would become golds and he would cry about their value because that's exactly what he said in his video. He got like 8 elites from his 250 Pro packs but wasn't happy because the elites were only worth 15k max each. And then he's saying how can packs be the same price now as they are at the end of the game when the end of the game gives better stuff value wise. But that's because at the end they have very little to keep anyone interested and the 'Free 99 legends' as toppers will be worth a lot less than the 92 OBJ that came out recently. He's even cried about how TOTW Johnson, Shady and Miller are all basically the same card as if it's EA's fault that they were the top performers. He's also said that because newer cards come out every week our cards are irrelevant. And as an example he says the BCA Miller came out like 4 days before the TOTW miller and now the BCA one is irrelevant and nobody wants. This is just straight up not true. People who don't have billions of coins like Toke can appreciate the lower overall Miller and he's like a fraction of the price with only like a -1 on all his card stats from the 90 one.

252,"I agree party so I'll run through your paragraph with some of my opinions on the same things. 

Aqib staying step for step with AJ green shouldn't happen. It's that simple, I have noticed this happen a few times and it definitely does need fixed. It basically saves people who make stupid plays on defence. 

Shutting down the run in quarters isn't out of the question at all of you have DB's that are capable tacklers they're no different than Linebackers because suction tackles make it that way and running is nearly as much luck as skill with broken tackles. 

Certain stats matter, certain stats don't. It's always been like that. There are a few experiment videos made to show which ones do actually matter. 

Drag routes aren't OP, If you run underneath coverage all you have to do is cover them in the middle with your linebacker then once they get past you they are covered by your flats. I know this because j play against them all the time and stop them and I run them all the time and have them stopped. 

MLB usering is only as good as you are at the game which is completely fair. Taking 2 players out of the game with 1 players isn't that much really considering it's all based on how good you actually are, and in real life a guy like Kuechly can take 2 or 3 players out of the game. 

The fumble question is a mystery that has baffled me for years. How has it not been fixed

320,Agreed. Although the if the coders took his ideas into consideration and put more work in on defensive CPU's there would be no such thing as cheese plays. If you pick the right defence and make good adjustments to lock a play it should be locked. If you put a player with good zone coverage in the purple zone that cover 3's start in it should be covering the C routes that everyone is throwing a lot now. If you put someone in a flat with good zone coverage it should cover the flat. And the problem is that is simply isn't. Granted if you have a player with like 70 zone coverage this wouldn't be too bad. But when you have like 88 zone coverage and you're giving up free plays in that zone that's unacceptable ,2016-10-01 04:15:27+00:00,d898deh,2.0,t1_d8981wk,618.0,MaddenUltimateTeam

442,"Agree completely. I stopped playing MUT last year before Christmas because every game I played in the higher ranks was nanos galore and I didn't want to give in and run them back so I just went and played a game that I enjoyed instead. I complained once, hoped all year that it would be fixed but eventually just gave up and had a year where I played a variety of fun games instead of getting angry at madden.

This year however I quite like the game. Sure there are still problems with this game,  like the WR pushing glitch, The D-Line glitches, Hurry up glitches. But EA are constantly at this game adding and fixing. Most of the stuff that has been complained about has been fixed, right down to the H2H rewards which imo didn't need fixed. It was all people crying about oh I don't get rewarded for going 2-2. Draft champions is way better. But I think now the H2H rewards are insane, I couldn't ask for more tbh.",2016-09-23 21:24:15+00:00,d7zeooh,1.0,t3_545jb6,18085.0,MaddenUltimateTeam

2. You are 100% correct

3. This is also true and yes to remove them just hover over them and press x on xbox square on playstation and it will give you the option.

4. No sets are really worth completing if you are looking for profit. The team heroes are good cards but you can't sell them so it's not like an investment you just have it forever. I wouldn't recommend them unless trying for MUT master.

As for chemistry I personally don't really think it's important at all. I have 4-3 chemistry going and don't notice a difference because it's only like a +1 or +2 on 3 stats. And yes it activates itself when the circle is full.

511,"A much smaller player base, and an even smaller amount of people blasting packs and grinding the shit out of the game. If there was a set like you mentioned which Basically could kickstart huge amounts of people to 500k. Players like Antonio brown who already cost 400k would nearly double in price. Because there would still be a tiny amount of them being packed but everyone would be able to afford the best receiver in the game. So you see how it wouldn't work because of pack odds and player rarity ? Also if there was no coin tax it would cause inflation because people would keep listing players for a tiny bit more and another tiny bit more so they can at least make a tiny bit of profit on them until eventually that player ends up inflating about 15k on what he should have been for no reason ",2016-09-20 13:06:37+00:00,d7uio7x,13.0,t1_d7u3el0,36839.0,MaddenUltimateTeam

691,"Most teams might give the ball to their best player, but not the saints. Brees will throw the ball to a 3 year old child if they are open, always has always will. You can only catch what is thrown to you, that's why its unfair to judge a receiver by his receptions and it's the reason average yards per catch is a stat. Snead had like 70 receptions, Colston had another 50 and Watson another 70 plus so I don't see how you can judge on that, Brees had like 450 completions and cooks caught 80 of them, meanwhile Ryan has 400 comps and julio has what like over 130 of them. That's just having the ball forced exactly like OBJ and exactly like Brown when Bell got hurt like you said.

He runs back about 10 yards because he sees the pressure coming eventually. Brees roles out 10 yards back and to the right he panics and holds RB, Brees spins around 360 perfect bullet across his body into his RB's chest wide open and gets the first down that ends the game essentially.

875,Non cheese related things that have helped me is watching people who are good at the game. My first madden online was Madden 25 and this was also the year I started watching football every week (being Irish we don't really get it here)  and I used to go like 2-8 in the worst divisions online and I usered my DT's and ends and stuff. Then I started watching Cookieboy and I loved how he was using his LB's. So from watching him I basically learned how to cover and bait routes and stuff now and I'll be getting at least a takeaway or 2 per game that really helps out. As for offense it seems every year is a new year and you just trial and error till you find what works for you.
