Realistically if I wanted to I know I could get in nearly 24 hours during a weekday if i really really wanted too. But in the weekend league I find myself struggling to even get in the 40 games and I'm not enjoying myself at all when I'm playing because it's so forced. I know i'm not the only one who has this problem either and I'm sure if there was something that lasted like 20 or 30 games over like 3 days during the week or 50 games over the 5 days it would give alot more people a reason to play the game during the week and it would suit a lot of people better than the weekend too.

I think they should have left the open H2H as what it was before the update. What's wrong with having 2 10 game seasons as a possibility. 

People think the rewards are juiced but I mean they aren't that juiced really. It's a few packs here and there. For 10 wins people were crying about getting 18,500 coins, an NAT Elite, a pro pack and the uniform, all that has changed is an extra 6,000 coins which is really a -3000 coins because your tickets cost 9k. So then your 3 extra badges which are worth 4,500 which if you're discarding brings you to a +1,500 then you get 3 extra pro packs likely worth about 8-10k if you're lucky. But all that with the risk of not going 10-0 or 10-1

Again 9 wins gets an extra 4K which is technically a -5k. 4 badges worth 6k brings you to a +1k if you're discarding them, and you get to extra pro packs again likely worth 5-8k if you're lucky. 

This new method is only really worth it for people who really really really want comp badges and on top of that it now makes Ranked DC irrelevant pretty much because 6 H2H wins is worth far more than 6 Draft wins instead of having them on par with each other. Other than that it's basically EA tricking people into discounted pro packs. 

Down votes welcome since everyone else seems to be loving it but this is just my take on it.

This guy was running the ball and Forte was breaking every tackle ( Had over 200 yards after contact which i was not happy about) but anyways when i finally shut down the run a few times he would go to any passing play with Evans on the outside left and put him on a fade and I'm pretty sure he was throwing bullet passes holding as far left as possible and Evans was reacting to the outside shoulder pass and he could RAC catch the ball because my corner kept running inside a bit last second as evans would run out. Tried all kinds of corner adjustments and nothing would stop this in Zone or man with commits or anything. In the end i found the only way to stop it was to man up a safety or my ROLB on him which obviously leaves a big hole on the field somewhere because it needs double covered and the only reason the ROLB or safety even work sometimes is because they knock the ball loose
