1,"I respectfully disagree with the statement that Guiliani is a joke. Yes, his personality is goofy and odd but he has big balls and he is brilliant thinker. 

Consider the following:

He served as US Attorney for Southern District of NY under the Reagan Administration. As US Attorney he personally handled and was lead prosecutor obtaining criminal prosecution of the largest crime families in NYC obtain dozens of convictions of some the worst offenders in the history of American mob. Time Magazine call Guiliani's legal work as ""the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the Chicago Mafia was swept away in 1943.""

Guiliani single handedly brought two of the most corrupt Wall Street insiders Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken.

He was Mayor of NYC, largest city in America, from 1994 to 2001. He is the only Republican to ever serve two terms as Mayor of New York and that says a lot right there.

As NYC Mayor he instituted a very controversial law enforcement campaign which put cops back on a street beat. Critics said that this would lead to racial profile, more arrests of blacks, more policy violence and racial discord (sound familiar). Well that was all hype and NYC was cleaned up of crime is a huge way in fact the murder rate went from 10,000 per year to 1,000 per year. I lived in NYC during this time and it was fucking night and day man. 

He sponsored a ""sanctuary"" type of regulations that were passed in which illegal immigrants with no criminal records could remain in NYC while going through the immigration process (sound familiar)

Of course there was his response to 9/11 which resulted in him being Time's 2001 Man of the Year. 

In 2006 he was a member of Congresses bi-partisan Iraq Study Group (ISG) which came to conclusions disagreeing with the then Bush Administration. Guiliani and the group concluded that ""the situation in Iraq was grave and deteriorating"" and called for ""changes in the primary mission"" that would allow ""the United States to begin to move its forces out of Iraq.""

In 2002 dude formed a Security Consulting business cal Giuliani Partners LLC, which had some controversy from the Left (not a bad thing). The company made $100 million in five years. Biggest gig they did was a security consulting contract with Rio de Janeiro, Brazil regarding the 2016 Summer Olympics. Biggest shit storm was advising people once allied with Slobodan Milošević.

In 2005 he became a law partner with Bracewell &amp; Giuliani LLP and worked on helping oil, gas, and energy industries and he took on an aggressive defense of coal-fired power plants against environmentalist. 

Dude worked the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) and advocated hard for groups removal from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. 

Throughout his career Guiliani has become personal friends with the current leaders of most, if not all, EU nations, his knows Putin personally, his personal knows the Omars of Saudia Arabi, Qatar, Yemen. He personally knows the leaders of Turkey, Pakistan, India and Greece. 

One issue the administration is looking hard at before putting him in Sect. of State position is the fact that Guiliani security firm and law office has done business with both Qatar and Saudi Arabia which we all know was a sponsor of Isis. I don't have a lot of details regarding how close Guiliani was involved in these specific transactions, but I can tell you that at the time he was not aware of any terrorist connections these states had. I can't speak for him, but given his high ethical standards I think its safe to say that if he had known he would have never been involved with the states no matter how much $ was involved.

Just my $.02.

In essence, the US and its new secretary of state would have some serious pull to obtain amnesty for Assange - where? I am not sure.

My hide is thickly scarred with wounds from a life spent battling enemies from both within and outside. These conflicts are not only jarring in the immediacy of their aftermath, but over the course of decades has noticeably jaded my perception of what may or may not be deemed sensitive by others who have never known the experience of passing through purgatory only to escape with the fiend riding on their back and whispering in their ear.

To you last point, I do not understand how one tongue could be worse than any other tongue because the tongue of every human is equally dangerous. Indeed, I have met only two human beings in my life that understood the power of their tongue and more importantly appreciated the inviolability of the sacred motor, which if removed, the tongue could not operate - the human breath.

23,"Your zealous advocacy for Mr. Assange is commendable and no doubt felt by many, including myself. Likewise, train of thought comment is important and it is good that you expressed. With that said, you are wrong. 

I believe that the premise of your argument is as follows:

Because Wikileaks dropped the Podesta Emails Trump became President; therefore, illegal conduct directed at the Trump Administration is a justifiable method to force the United States into freeing Julian Assange.

No doubt your views considering the need for the world, not just the United States, to recognize Assange situation as a violation of human rights is acceptable. Unfortunately, the manner by which you propose to obtain this goal is not. 

First, while you and I and maybe 10 million other Americans have a good idea of what materials are contained within the Podesta emails, Trump's ascension to the Oval office was not ""widely due"" to these materials. This statement logically without merit. To attribute an election result to any one incident is entirely overbroad, without merit and mirrors the arguments asserted by the Soros left MSM i.e. - Shillary lost because white racist males came crawling out of their basements for the first time in American politics. As a side note - journalistic artiles are in fact admissible evidence in certain contextual presentations unrelated to this conversation. The Podesta emails are inadmissible not because they are journalistic materials, but rather they contain hearsay statements that would go to the truth of the matter asserted therein.

Secondly, we need to begin with the baseline understanding that although conceptually speaking Assange appears to be in ""prison,"" he is not ""imprisoned."" Instead, Julian has voluntarily remitted his person to care of the country of Ecuador for his own personal safety. This distinction is absolutely critical to what you and your friends believe is an acceptable policy of action. 

For example (this is a rough example but bear with me please) imagine I published damning documents about Commissioner Boss Hogg and he is not happy about that. Boss Hogg tells his dimwitted henchman, Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane to arrest me. At same time, Boss Hogg pays all my neighbors $20 to accuse me of stealing the neighborhood goat which of course I did not do. Lastly, Ms. Daisy Duke is the only journalist and she's on Boss Hogg's payroll too and so she is publishing all kinds of horseshit stories about me. So for my own safety I lock myself up in my house voluntarily which Hazzard County Regulation forbids entrance to by anyone attempting to grab me. So now stuck in my house I use my carrier pigeons to get word out to my new friends in neighboring counties about the situation. 

Can I leave? 
       Yes. 
Should I leave? 
      Probably Not
So what can be done?

Well, since Julian is not in prison then breaking him out through illegal activity is not only inapplicable but will do nothing but make is situation worse by pissing off what is now his ""dormant neighbors"" England while very likely eroding his new support base (friends in neighboring counties) the American electorate. This is a critical point here because I believe that you and your friends fail to realize that until approximately 6 months ago Julian Assange and Wikileaks was a fringe element in the American collective consciousness - a hacker, a nut job, a conspiracy theorist - you get the picture. Now he is a Patriot and hero. To commit illegal acts against the Trump Administration - the very Administration that these new friends have fought so hard to put in the White House - is going to flip Assange from Patriot Hero to Treasonous Felon. And I goddamn gaurantee you the MSM will jump all over the fucking criminal felon attacking US bullshit and jam Assange right up Putin's ass with it. 

Is that what you want or what you are going for? 

Now, back to Hazzard County. Julian is not a prisoner - so he does not need to be Pardoned. What Julian needs is AMNESTY. AMNESTY IS NOT OBTAINED THROUGH CRIMINAL CONDUCT BORDER CYBER TERRORISM. Let me repeat that because it is absolutely fundamental that anyone considering to join in your ridiculous half-baked concept needs to know:

AMNESTY IS NOT OBTAINED THROUGH CRIMINAL CONDUCT BORDER CYBER TERRORISM

Amnesty is obtained by working with - NOT AGAINST - the state you are trying to place Julian within. Yes, that is the real goal here is to get Julian into the United States with protected Amnesty status. We want our Patriot and Hero here with us in the United States. 

Thus, I hope that you and your friends reconsider your plans. Lastly, let me say this - I am responding here not so much about your comment but to spread this message to any other person who is thinking along the same lines you are. For you, anyone who is even halfway serious about committing not only felonious conduct by cyber terrorism is not going to come to this forum or any other forum on the internet and shout it with a megaphone to the very Government is seeks to act while wearing a right orange suit and waiving a flourscent green flag with a target on it with the Words ""Here I am"" written underneath it. At least that has been my experience.

     See Ex parte Grossman, 267 U.S. 87, 121 (1925); Ex parte Garland,   71 U.S. 333, 380 (1866)

2.    The President cannot issue a pardon in cases of impeachment. 
      See U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 1.

3.    POTUS does not have the power to issue a pardon for a violation of state law.--- See McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 435-36 (1819); Seee also Eric M. Freedman, On Protecting Accountability, 27 Hofstra L. Rev. 677, 713-14 (1999) (“Since the power to pardon extends only to ‘Offences against the United States,’ the officeholder would remain subject to correlative state prosecutions regardless of the self-pardon; and whether or not those could be brought while he or she remained in office, they could be afterwards.”).

Now the issue of whether POTUS can self-pardon has of course never be tested so there is debate how SCOTUS would come down.

So POTUS here could grant a HRC a full pardon for any federal offenses. He could pardon her for any monetary penalties she may incur as result of her federal crimes unless the money has been paid already

Now DC or NY or other state could charge her state RICO laws and POTUS is SOL on that. But a Governor could grant a pardon. So i look for a republican state - like where Gawdy is - and GO that route.

From the Wikileaks emails (not even talking about emails on Weiner computer) - WJC, HRC, Podesta, Mook and others are looking at real and certain jail time if she is not elected - Guaranteed. 

The Sect. State email investigation was a fucking diversion - standard FBI tactic - and it was leverage to bring Huma down to talking. Trust me - educated women, going through divorce with 9 yr old child is not going to take the fall for HRC - she will talk and she is talking - I know. She will walk.

53,"I want add one more point here. 

As we all know now the FBI have been investigation the Foundation for over a year prior to this last couple of weeks. We also know that FBI agents presented the case to DOJ and we told ""stand down"". But some agents kept going right. But I can tell that they were having a hard time getting evidence to amp up there case to take back to Comey and DOJ. 

We also know that after WikiLeaks start dropping bombs the FBI's  investigation into the Foundation got warmer and was given a second look by Comey. Then the NYC FBI field office found  tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Clinton related emails on  Weiner computer which took the Foundation investigation from warm to fucking broil.  . 

Ok so here come my legal analysis. 

Start with Wikileaks bombs. There is 100% certainty that agents were coming through the leaked emails for facts related to the Foundation. This look was not so much for evidence but for leads. That's because the Wikileaks emails are inadmissible hearsay documents and would not support an indictment. Yes the DKIM is important but not enough - in my opinion to over come Federal Rule of Evidence 803 and would not meet any exception to the hearsay rule. 

But! The emails found on the Weiner computer ARE admissible and if those emails are the same emails dropped by Wikileaks then they will support an indictment. Let me just say this too - that in order for FBI to get a search warrant it had to have evidence which was probably some Foundation related Podesta Emails. 

Lastly, in my opinion I believe that the following individuals are targets for acts that constitute the following crimes  

WJC - RICO, Tax evasion
HRC - RICO, Public Office corruption, Campaign contribution violation
Doug Band - RICO 
Podesta - RICO, Public Office corruption, Campaign contribution violation
Mook - RICO, Campaign contribution violation
Palmeiri RICO, Campaign contribution violation

And what gives with the ""big leak"" motherfucker? Huh? What 50,000+ internal HRC campaign emails that fucking brought down not just 1 but will be 2 DNC chairs, exposed CFI and CGI has an ass fucking den of slobbering sadistic greedy whores to be bought for US favors by any fucking corporation or terrorist humping Muslim country, that gutted any and all ethical standing the DNC ever had to the point that it will never ever be the same, that exposed the MSM as the witches cold titty sucking bitches they are who pump out propaganda for Soros as he face fucks them or that completely pulled the Satan spirit cooking veil  back on the goat horned wizards WJC/HRC pulling the levers of the Clinton Political Crime Syndicate or the multiple convictions coming to a courtroom near you for BREAKING campaign finance laws, tax evasion and fucking RICO is NOT A FUCKING BOMBSHELL.

The reason is that Assange can testify to process used to obtain and leak the emails while an FBC forensic expert can testify to authenticity of emails.

Additionally my reporting, use of current events has been published on /r/all and has reached an audience of millions of Americans. In fact it has been so influential that the Democratic Candidate for President Hillary Clinton has labeled us as being in a basket of deplorables and has alluded that we represent nearly half the entire country. Accordingly my activity is primarily engaged in disseminating information to over a hundred million fellow countrymen and women.

As reddit.com is a forum library and communication platform open to the general public, millions of citizens will have access to the information contained in the materials which are the subject of this request. Further, as reddit.com serves as an internet archive and library for information submitted to its forums such that reddit.com is community resource fostering openness in government, as well is its role in facilitating research and learning so that the community as a whole will be well served by distribution of the requested materials through reddit.com 

While statement of this type does not, by itself, ensure a public interest fee waiver, there is some legislative history which suggests the importance Congress placed on this means of disseminating information into the public realm. Government agencies should recognize the vital contributions that depositories of public records such a reddit.com make to the public's understanding of the operations of government. All federal agencies should implement the intended favorable treatment of these organizations under the FOIA. 135 Cong. Rec. S8466 (daily ed. July 20, 1989).

Why did he cough up the devices voluntarily because he is confident he did not send or receive underage pics or porn. So his lawyer says if there is nothing there then turn it over. He had no idea emails were there and neither did Huma because they were likely uploaded to the device after Huma destroyed every email she thought she had. 

The seizure of the emails was totally legal and gives the FBI the one thing they he WikiLeaks emails can never give them. Admissibility in a court of law. The Wikileaks are the same emails I am gone the FBI have and probably the other 33k that HRC deleted. Most importantly the Wikileaks emails give HRC no cover, no where to run or hide and we know why she must be prosecuted and so the DOJ, POTUS and FBI have no cover.

I personally have posted linked to your brillancy website on all over twitter say ""Yo peeps here is a simple way to get the top 100 so far"" so get you dad, your mom, grandma etc to look.

Key-Critical-Core to whole shit storm is framing the signatures meaning what people are signing up for is at the top and this must say in no uncertain terms that ""I....believe and demand...that HRC immediately withdraw her candidacy for POTUS""

If I may - millions of Americas have seen or read some of the Podestaemails and I believe that a vast majority of those are justifiably outraged the their contents. I believe that this growing anger may change what looked to be for months a foregone conclusion that HRC would be the next POTUS. 

But it is frightening to think that the Trump movement and PodestaEmails may not be enough which combined with what will clearly be significant voter fraud to stop HRC &amp; Her ""Go high when they go low"" Gang from taking power.

110,"I have read numerous topics and subreddit comments on here about this subject and while I am no expert in such matters and do not want to cause confusion to what is already a troubling series of developments regarding a man I highly respect; I would like to share a perceptive that may or may not have been previous considered here. 

While tossed out as ""conspiracy"" tales because the actual ""shooter"" remains (in large part) unknown, the historical evidence concerning the development of financial powers behind the US Government can be traced to the years leading up to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Factually, it is now well known that had President Kennedy lived he was likely to be re-elected given that is popularity rate at the time he died was over 60% and his opponent would have been Barry Goldwater. As such, upon being reelected he closets advisers and trusted Military individuals knew that beginning in spring of 1964 second term Kennedy was going to move forward with withdrawing all American forces from Vietnam and two, because he had earned the deep respect of Soviet Leader Khrushchev, both men had already reached a deal (then secret) to reduce nuclear arms and eventually cease all development in a yet determined time. These two dramatic shifts in American policy meant a financial loss to numerous of international conglomerate in an amounts that today would be in the Trillions, not billions. So, something had to be done and done it was. Following 1965, these same financial interests have continued to play ever deepening and growing vast array roles within the US government. 

Jumping forward quite sometime to the years just post-9/11, a rift began to develop between military branches and intelligence agencies within the United States government. The developing schism began to take significant shape after 2008 when President Obama turned from advisers such as General Paetrus to more ""dovish"" advisers in the military. In doing and in prep to 2012 election Obama began US troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan against the advise of most, if not all, of his Joint Chiefs. Troop withdrawal was good for elections in US but cause a whole shit storm in the Iraq and Afghanistan which in turn led to the Intelligence agencies to between asserting significant more control over military operations in both the region and on the Islamic Terrorist front.  This in turn forced various military branches (primarily USAFSOC) but also USAF, US Marines, US Navy and US Army to take mission and targeting orders from NSA and CIA among other intelligence divisions within. 

Concurrently with the above-developments, the US began a slow steady withdrawal from unconditional support for Israeli. While never openly walking away from Israel, US policy began to move toward seeking resolution to the Isreali / Arab conflict through a possible two state solution. US mid-east policy become more complicated with the outbreak of conflict in Syria whose rebels - in the earliest stages - were being funded by Saudi Arabia with the US playing a more backseat role with armaments and assistance making every effort to not put American forces on the ground in the conflict. Another significant development was Iran's increase nuclear capabilities and its efforts to enrich uranium which was moving along a fast clip that US intelligence understood, but this speed was never overlooked by the Israeli mossad. The final piece to the puzzle comes as the Russian bear began asserting its influence in Syria which along with Assad means nothing to Russia financially or strategically (it does maintain a naval base though which is the excuse it gave to intervene for the Mossad government). With that said, Syria does provide Russia with the opportunity to show its former Baltic states that the Bear is taking on the Eagle toe-to-toe - i.e. Russia is back to being a super power. 

Russia needs these Baltic states to be impressed with its new military and world stage authority since Russia has been quietly working for almost a decade to create a ""Baltic Union"" along the lines of the EU with Russia being the go to big daddy for protection. In exchage, Russia will reap Trillions in gas sales to Europe which already obtains 70% of all gas consumed from Russia and former Baltic states. A significant portion of the gas flows through of all obvious places - the Ukraine.

Last piece here is what arose in 2008-09 when the thieving whore Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State regarding Iran/Israel and US. In summer 2008, Isreal advised POTUS that it was planning a military strike against Iran to take out its nuclear enrichment program and as a treaty partner is damn well expected POTUS to get in on the fun. POTUS said no. Isreal said - ok we will nuke then in January 2009. POTUS said - give me a minute. That is when HRC &amp; Gang came up with the Iran Nuclear deal - first as pre-negotiations and later as full negotiations. Of course Isreal was not at the table, but they were guaranteed that the final plan would ensure that Iran would not restart Uranium enrichment.  Yea, well that did not happen and Israel was pissed and remains very pissed at Obama but ---- especially HRC --- who is sees as a future threat. 

The rift in the US government from military withdraw combined with the perceived (likely real) threat HRC &amp; Gang pose to several military branches, industrial institutions and Israel appears to have now become an all out war being played before out eyes in the media. 

Note - I am not saying and would never say that Assange or Wikileaks was tool or had any connection whatsoever to any US government happenings, internal conflicts etc. He is truly a freedom loving brilliant man with incredible high standards and unshakable ethics. But I fear he may be caught in a very precarious situation - at least until such time as post-election. 

With regard to his safety and health, my gut tells me that he is too valuable and too dangerous to eliminate. My gut is also inclined to believe that he has not been removed from the embassy which has too much risk of exposure. So, my gut tells me that he is under protection (not torture), disconnecting the internet was for his safety following the Ecuadorian government lead that some type of operation may be underway. Also, my gut tells me that Assange is not alone in the embassy but has some type of protection. 

That is just my two cents and like every persons with asshole I have an opinion as well. All fucking speculation, but based upon some factual and historical context.

115,"My teenager implication is probably a little much but I do believe that there are translation errors.  A linguistic friend look at the tweets and said the following. 

For telling the original language of a writer, we go after other things other than spelling.  Often spelling is correct, because a writer of a foreign language resorts a lot to dictionaries.  But syntax will look a bit funny, and grammatical conventions of the main language will creep in.  Germans, will use, lots, of, commas.  People with Slavic language will have tendency to leave out article (the, a, an) or put one in at an inappropriate place, because articles don't exist in those languages. .an arabic person ,who writes right to left with a different alphabet ,may put commas and periods in a slightly wrong space ,and nOt capitalize correctly .

118,"Seriously though. With no Internet he has no secure communication abilities. It's pretty hot right now so transferring information to a person in the embassy to be carried outside is dangerous for that person. Also not just anybody can transfer information for Assange because no one could get a secure connection from inside the embassy. 

Finally I think Assange has made a rational choice to stay out of sight right now. 1. By laying out of sight  he keeps the US media attention on Wikileaks as an organization that is still producing material with out him and so the media can't sit back and scream ""Assange is a Russian spy"" which harms not just him but WIkiLeaks, its reputation and Ecuador. Secondly, choosing to stay low keeps the cool with his hosts which preserves his safety and his life.

I think he is isolating himself actually because the US has placed a lot of focus on him personally as well as Wikileaks.

He keeps the attention on the leaks and Wikileaks the organization rather than on himself and 2. He takes the heat off of Ecuador.

127,"I respectfully disagree with your position regarding the electability of Trump by which I do not mean his character, intelligence or abilities. Instead, Trumps electability is a product of historical context.  In fact, scholarly consensus holds that US Presidents are selected more by the immediate (&gt;10 yr.) history preceding their election to office. This was just true 150 years ago as it is today. 

With that said, the rise of a - for lack of better words ""Trump Movement"" - in the US has been studied and deemed as forthcoming for approximately 20 years. From a scholarly standpoint the discussions have focused on the strain caused by funding long-term Middle East wars which strain is fault by the American poor and working middle class. There was the 2008 financial crash as well. Most importantly was the rise of high tech work and income which of course does not produce a physical product but generates unprecedented returns. Meaning people getting their hands dirty for a living see others making money without a physical product as corrupt. 

Other historical pieces leading up to Trump are the Mideast Spring, the rise of terror strikes (besides 9/11) in both Europe and US which a vast majority of Americans always considered to be an Israeli problem ""over there.""

The most critical factor that scholars could not predict was Wikileaks. WikiLeaks changed the whole paradigm of the conversation because it opened a window to what the average person thought existed but had never seen. Yet, even with pulling back the current for 9+ years WikiLeaks remained - in the minds of everyday Americans -a marginalized fringe element. Of course this all changed in the last 16 days. But this change would not have occurred had it not been for the Clinton server scandal which led directly to American populace's mass acceptance of WikiLeaks as a legitimate voice. This belief is made even more so by the reality that what is being released is what the people knew but could not prove. 

So what does this mean for Wikileaks? Well Wikileaks - like any organism made up of numerous pieces - is evolving. Initially all things ""react"" initially to change and such a reaction is usually perceived by those familiar with the entity as odd, unprecedented or strange which it is. But after ""reaction"" comes growth and the growth stage is not where we are and remains to be seen.

129,"Just my $.02. 

I don't think the errors spell anything but it is a good Da Vinci code idea but way to obvious and too simplistic of a code. 

To crack this nut we don't need the Conspiracy Sledgehammer but instead we use Einstein's imagination. 

To begin remove yourself from where ever you are by closing your eyes and imagine you are the person sending the tweets and ask yourself as you look around. 

Where am I?
What is going on around me? 
Am I sitting a table? In car? On a train? 
How many people are around me? Is it quiet? Is it quiet? 

Now look at the tweets again. 

First, the spelling mistakes involve letters in positions of the words that are (predominately) soft vowels and consonants- a, e, h, l and n. The r is in a hard rolling consonant sound and the i is also a hard sound. 

Second, the mistakes are careless. While a few words are slight high on English grammar scales (algorithm) all are generally common. Also, ever device's automatic spell checker would catch these mistakes and offer the corrected version. Which implies that they are intentional mistakes and I would agree if the author spoke English as a first language. 

Now back to being writers shoes. Imagine you don't Speak English as first language or even as a second language. You have a rough ability to talk to a native English speaker if necessary but you don't write anything in English all that often. And when u do you take the time to make sure translation is solid. 

If you don't have time ---- well you go to next best thing --- an App or online translator. Either will makes mistakes especially when translating plural nouns (speeches) or personal names (Herbert) or soft consonants (algorithm). This is even more likely when the person is not sure how to spell the English word in their native tongue. 

So the someone who wrote the tweets was probable mobile using a shitty translating tool and did not even catch the misspellings till after the fact. 

So where does that leave us. Find what language will commonly misspell those words with Translator App or online generator and you will have your first clue to who is sending the tweets or at least a pretty damn good idea about what country they are from
