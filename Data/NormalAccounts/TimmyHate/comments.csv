Saying the guy we wanted is because he would likely not have been there at 20. There was talk we would take him at 7. So we got a guy who was much higher up our draft board - happier with that phrasing?

We got 7.5 million we don't have to spend in actual cash and don't have to drop on someone in Free Agency that we don't want. We have a ton of young guys on cheaper contracts so we don't end up with any albatross contracts when they all need bridge deals.

S3: Nate and Sophie finally get together, Elliott feels he has atoned for working for Maurue
S4: The weakest to this theory, but wraps up Dubenich and puts Nate and Sophie in a good place
S5: Neat little bow on N/S, and completes Parkers long evolution into the new Mastermind.

Dead was a solid A for me. I would have paid the full price just for the DP figure, plus the T shirt is great. Liked the WD figure, soap on a rope was only thing keeping this from an A+. Replace that with a prop of similar quality to the Multipass and you have an almost perfect box for me.


Versus was a B+. Love the Aliens figure and the beanie (if it had not been quite so tall would have moved to an A-). Happy with Harley comic but wish shed been thr shirt. Don't care for the Wallet.

You can stick your fingers in your ears and head in the sand, but Counterfeit clothing is linked with terror/organised crime. Why is it such a stretch to assume NHL jerseys are not part of that?

I actually do my best to not but products made in sweatshops. My shoes are made in New Zealand, as are my pants, underwear and shirt. My phone is made in Korea. My TV is manufactured in Japan. I check where my products come from and make my decisions based on ethics.

Do I own fake jerseys myself- yes. I admit it. I have 3 fakes which I use exclusively for on ice trainings 

Rangers Gretzky- got ripped off buying second hand online
Flames Heritage Classic - gift from well meaning family member 
Team USA white - didn't realise it was a fake when brought from a store (which I have since reported to authorities).

For me it is an ethical position, as well as an aesthetic one. I am opposed to fakes. But nowhere I have directly attacked those who wear them. I've simply given the facts as best I know them so people can make their own decisions. All of this bullshit started because I wanted to alert the team they had retweeted a fake jersey, and then had a rant to my followers on Twitter.  

My point about the top selling jerseys is that for players like OEL or Doan, every fake sold (where they might have otherwise brought a genuine one) is a bigger portion of their overall potential sales. I know T&amp;K (and Crosby and Ovi et al) are the best sellers because of their skill as well, I don't disagree.  But if OEL suddenly sells 1000 extra jerseys, the NHL will take notice. 

I think we are going to have to agree to disagree. I'm not saying everyone wearing a fake is going to join the mob or ISIS - but I am saying that profits may be going to those organisations. People can take that information and make up their own minds.

If it were up to me - I would ban any fake jersey from the Arenas. But I would also set up a bounty- turn in your fakes for a discount on the real thing.

436," As the ""Elitist Douchbag"" let me outline why fake jerseys are an issue. To be clear, this is not an attack on you personally or your fandom - but my views on the fake jerseys:


1) Counterfeit sports merchandise has been linked with Terrorist Groups and organised crime.  http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/nhl/nhl-will-attack-a-scourge-threatening-the-game-fake-jerseys 


2) Counterfeit jerseys are made in sweatshops. While the real ones are made in Canada, and the replicas are made in Indonesia under, as far as I've ever seen, humane conditions. 


3) Counterfeit jerseys cost Teams. Both directly in lost revenue, and indirectly by the league making less merchandise. Look at any new item the NHL puts out and it's the teams that sell more that get the new stuff. We are a small fanbase to begin with.


4) Counterfeit jerseys affect players. When the league decides who to show case, you can bet your ass jersey sales are a factor. When sponsors look for who to feature - same deal. 

Those are the factual reasons. I also have my own emotional reasons

I've been a Coyotes fan since 1996. I live on the other side of the world, and had to seek out NHL scores in our local paper every day. I am a die hard - my wedding was almost a disaster because I yelled so much at a game 3 days before  (8 round Shootout win over the oilers) that it sounded like I was 13 again. A few days after my wedding, we spent some of our honeymoon money on 5th row seats vs the Wings (2010 playoffs game 1). I've owned authentic versions of every generation of jerseys. My dog is named Howler. To me, a fake jersey is an insult to the team - imagine a US flag with pink stripes and using Sky Blue.

Most of the fakes are sloppy too. Not to pick on you but these are the issues I saw immimmediately:
 Issues:
1) Cream numbers – the real jerseys have white 
2) No shoulder patch (if it’s there it’s hidden and too small)
3) Wrong striping pattern (that generation of jerseys goes narrow-wide-narrow (Also known as ‘northwestern stripes’) same as our centre line at the time)
4) Wrong Red (the real red is significantly darker)
5) Outline of logo should be white (not sand)

I picked all that up immediately from a photo in my Twitter time line on my phone.

They offered him a way out; a single arrow, coated in poison, into the heart of a passing adventurer. It all seemed so easy – until he went to confirm the kill, and discovered his beloved Keyleth.
