Mustache

Increased literacy

Massive industrialization

Beat the nazis

Wrote poetry still admired in Georgia and Russia today

Turned Russia into a superpower

Also, mustache


cons:

Literally killed 120 million people with his bare hands (doesn't matter, kulaks deserved it)

Gulags (kindly reeducated people)

Didn't really like Chairman Mao, Tito, or Trotsky (Poor Trotsky :c)

LENIN LITERALLY WARNED US ABOUT STALIN (along with the other Bolsheviks, though it's only convenient with Stalin)

Kinda fucked over Poland with the help of the Nazi's (uhm, hmm. yeah, pretty shitty thing to do, Comrade)

Holomador (even though Stalin sent relief aid, he's still apparently the cause. This is totally not appropriated Nazi propaganda)

Re-illegalized abortion and homosexuality (:/)

In Conclusion:
Stalin had a cool mustache
