6,"&gt; I'd personally be cautious of trying to take such a strong corrective approach, versus the pro-nutrient method that say /u/0_- is a proponent of

That's why I threw in the boron citrate, apsartate, and glycinate link  :)     ....if you watch the video (and I highly recommend it), around the ~22m mark? he talks about the synergistic properties of boron &amp; magnesium. Doesn't entirely apply to the microbiome per se but... it's good to make sure you're getting plenty of mag anyway, esp with increased quantities of boron.

As far as our current understanding of the microbiome? Yeah, we still have a *lot* to learn. Anyone acting like they 'know it all' is either selling you something or just plain wrong. We know a lot, and a lot has been learned in just the past couple of years, but.. ..we still have a lot to go and, given the nature of it, 'knowing it all' is, quite simply, impossible. Just too many moving pieces acting in &amp; of their own accord.. ..and *re*acting accordingly.

I wouldn't be too too quick to dismiss borax though.  You can certainly buffer the impact of its chemical formula by cooking with it.  Just sprinkle 1/8-1/4tsp in a dish her or in some rice/pasta water there.. ...the heat &amp; water will break it down, the O7'll all likely evaporate away, and a bit more sodium along with the boron?  it 'ain't gonna kill ya' ...and you get a cheap way to integrate boron into your diet w/out the hassle nor cost of taking supplements. 

The 'borax water' stuff... ...leave that to those looking for a more-immediate response than it sounds like you're wanting.",2016-09-14 17:15:26+00:00,d7mmnxv,7.0,t1_d7mm5wu,621.0,Microbiome
7,"&gt; Are you suggesting borax intake to eliminate your own microbiome and rebuild?

Not to 'eliminate it', but to help readjust it? yeah.   Boron is vital to the immune system's proper function.  It helps with fungi, viruses, and just overall immuniological health in general .. ...but it isn't really antibacterial, antiprotozoal, or antimycobacterial beyond just supporting the system's ability to actively choose to fight these organism-types.  It's base properties *are* antifungal &amp; antiviral in a more natural state though.

That said, it won't 'eliminate' the microbiome as much as it'll help to readjust it.

..that's boron. Borax seemingly does this even more so / more powerfully than boron alone. 

&gt; That sub didn't really provide much insight to your theory.

It's not really 'my theory' so much as others' that've been out there for quite some time now.  But to kinda-sorta 'make it my own' per ease of wording it, basically pro-b's can absolutely help process the sugars in the diet to break them down so that less of them are 'intact' by the time they hit the blood (just read any of the *dozens* of things out there on blood sugar levels and regular intake of ACV for examples. believe there are peer-reviewed studies floating around that shouldn't be too difficult to find if you spend a half-a-minute looking for them).

That said, the pro-b's have the *potential* to become 'parasitic' or at least influential as well.  Lets say you have a heavy-sugar diet. You take some pro-b's. They breed out like crazy. You stop eating such a sugar-rich diet. Your new diet can't sustain the population the way the old diet did. The population of the pro-b's (and the rest of the microbiome) readjusts around the new diet. Die-off happens.  During this, before fully dying back, the organisms send out 'demands' for the old/regular diet's intake of nutrients... ...sugars, etc.  You 'crazy' sugar temporarily until things readjust.

'Other', more-natural organisms within the microbiome can do the same thing.  Let's go for the general culprit alt-health goes after and throw one of the hundreds of strains of candida in here.   

Going with candida being a spore forming fast breeding, fast reproducing fungi, killing it back can be incredibly difficult.. ..anyway, esp via 'starvation approaches'.  Sometimes taking a more active approach helps to accelerate the process.  Boron can be one of these.   Borax even more so.

...not to mention boron/borax's other benefits. 

&gt; I've worked with borax in a formulation capacity and would not recommend ingesting it.

Why not? What in its chemical formula makes it so 'dangerous'?  Borax is Na2B4O7 + xH20.  What in there is so horrendous?  Sodium? The quantity of sodium ingested to get a more-desired quantity of boron is .. ...minimal at best. negligible either way (unless you're super sensitive or something). The Oxygen? pretty much the same as the sodium, albeit in greater quantity but.. ..we already consume plenty of oxygen atoms anyway.   The water molecules? ...no. 

Lastly is the boron... which is kind of the point of taking borax to begin with.  Borax:boron is 11:1 I believe. So, 500mg borax = ~45mg boron? This is a very small amount of borax anyway. Something like a 00 or 000 capsule at the most. 1/8tsp I believe.. ..depending on the quantity of water molecules.

75,"Yes and no. Obviously it's 'less than ideal', but it's a crack-quick way to do it.  Since it's pretty much *only* the biomass that breaks down, the rest will be there if/when(ever) they get around to 'mining it'.

Metals remain their respective elements. The plastics don't (really) breakdown. ... ...so, if/whenever they get around *to* 'mining' it, it'll all still be there.  

Most of these operations are secondary businesses running within the infrastructure, or will run once the landfill is capped and sold to a third party 'management business'. 

But, there's *lots* of 'everything' in landfills.  They're actually 'quite profitable operations', but they're also competitive and not really talked about *because* of this.  Depending on how pre-sorted the waste is before going in, there are a *lot* of high value metals in the average landfill.  

Before I took over /r/waste, I ran across an article with a really great breakdown of metal 'waste' per landfill.  

I don't dare quote numbers with any degree of accuracy as it was a few years ago but, it was something like for every 1 ton of landfill waste (where e-waste is included), there's nearly an ounce of platinum, &gt;1oz of gold, several ounces of silver, etc etc. 

This is, of course, with the biomass having broken down already.   Lots of plastic, etc.   History Channel had a great episode on it about a decade ago.. ..before they were bought up by the Christian Right group that turned it over to aliens, monsters, and 'whatever' it became once it was rebranded 'History' vs 'History Channel'..

..went into the technological advancements per the management of waste.. ...how sorting it is automated, how the materials are extracted, etc.  'Great' episode for what it was... and even *it* was tip o' the iceberg vs what was going on even *then*, let alone since.  

It's estimated that any given municipality can generate ~15-25% of its energy from landfill gases alone (be it first-stage anaerobic digestion or second stage pyrolysis.. ...higher and/or closer to the 25% number if the pyrolysis process is broken down into two steps.. ..first with 'lower temperature' pyrolysis (~1,500F or below) with a follow-up gasification step via plasma.)

But, there's a LOT of money in the materials as well.  If/when/as/once n.gas capacity gets 'soaked up again', it will have a lot more value. 'If' this happens, it'll become much more common, but, on top of the ~15-25% of energy from landfill, it's estimated that &gt;*50%* of raw materials for a given area could come form landfills.. ...maybe even higher if more efficient processes are used in manufacturing of new products from the old metals

(ex: computers use less gold/aluminum/copper/etc than they used to.  Cans are ever-thinner aluminum, but greater purification *in* the aluminum so its stronger.. or just as strong but off of lower percentage of material.. ...etc.)

Theoretically, we could live off of nearly 100% recycled materials if environmentalists were able to successfully push limits on mining and such. 

The mining boom in Australia &amp; Africa (predominately by China) has drastically increased the quantity of materials mined thus available so.. ...economics aren't there.. ...*yet*.    ...but they will be sooner than later, and most certainly by century's end, if not much much sooner.",2016-08-14 04:08:18+00:00,d6gph92,2.0,t1_d6foai8,73172.0,Waste

Saw a headline a few weeks back that said that parts of it were just *now* starting to catch-up, but, it's kinda idealized to be thought of that way.. ..like how most fans of nuclear think that waste is stored in dry cask when, in reality, ~70% is still stored in pools.

The industry likes people to *think* it's that well regulated and that 'clean', but in reality, it isn't. Coal has a habit of pushing the 'most advanced tech' to the forefront of headlines per coal tech used in the industry.. ..and wrap it under an illusion that the entire industry is as advanced as whatever tech is being pushed.  To be hated as much as they are, biz's in the coal industry actually spend quite a lot on PR.  I've posted a few articles about it to /r/coal in the last.. year-to-18-months. 

apologies if tone comes across as being 'snarky', I don't mean it that way. more just trying to express that that's actually a common misconception. it's gotten 'better' via local regulations but, I'd argue from my hip-shot assessment that more than less *don't* use the more advanced scrubbing tech.  *esp* in places like China, India, Africa, elsewhere..

The point being that we're growing native perennial grasses that build soil, are energy-dense, and have a high lignocellulosic value such that maximized biochar production can be harvested for the sake of removing carbon, getting it back into the soil, and retaining water to not only need less of it pumped out of the aquifers, but to give it longer in the soil such that the aquifers can refill to begin with.",2016-08-08 23:52:56+00:00,d69q79x,6.0,t1_d69pybe,362.0,Agriculture

Said: if you could go the first 30 minutes after waking up w/out smoking, it got progressively easier to *not* smoke each subsequent one throughout the day.. ..*if* you wanted to not smoke one.

A separate study about a decade ago (on phone so can't find it either) said that cutting back' works to a point. The number of receptors your cells grow is relative to the quantity of nicotine available.. ..genetic predisposition comes into play to an extent.. ..but, 'starving' these back helps tremendously.. ..to a point.

Don't give into cravings. Offset smoking by 30 minutes of (physical) desire, and the subsequent generation of cells will produce less receptors.. ..to a point.

Then, once that point is achieved, you'll be at your genetic minimum of receptors per cell. 1 month tops does this.

From there, cold turkey is really the only way to go. If memory serves, it was 7-10 cigs a day for the average person.

Then it's 3-7 days to break the physical addiction, and 3-7 weeks the psychological.

Nothing easy about it either way. ..but, there's a lot more in cigs that's addictive than just nicotine. Don't believe me? Simply try switching brands and you'll see.

...now, depends on where one falls on the whole CO2/climate change deal.. ...but, regardless of that, simply reducing or even neutralizing emissions alone won't return the atmospheric carbon levels back to where they were pre-humanity's increase in excess release of them.

It took humanity to get them to jump 150ppm+ in 150yrs+, it'll take humanity to get them back down.. ...while this certainly helps neutralize it, it *won't* bring them down.   carbon negativity is needed for that and, as such, what better way to do that than via a carbon negative energy source?

...biomass tends not to be very energy dense vs 'geological  hydrocarbons'.. ...so, shipping it around the world, unless politics subsidizes .. isn't really all that economically viable and [certainly isn't 'green'](https://www.reddit.com/r/biomass/comments/4j77bi/is_biomass_energy_renewable_new_report_says_no/).

Jump back to Mike Chieky's [Solve for X talk at Google 4 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkYVlZ9v_0o) ... ...even with *more* energy-dense strains of crops like [miscanthus](/r/miscanthus) or [algae](/r/algae) (vs [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass), which is still way more energy dense than corn, but also much 'woodier' than miscanthus and definitely algae.. ie, higher biochar production)..

...it still isn't really all that viable to ship much more than 25-50 miles... 100 'tops' really.   ...before being processed &amp; densified via various ways ...pelletization is a common one, or, in the case of corn, converting to ethanol... so, getting right of all the 'stalks' (stover) and 'ears' and husks, and even the weight of the kernels themselves... ethanol is *much* more energy dense than 'the rest of it'... ...but, again, politics intervenes in this case and, as such, most ethanol refineries are 'much farther than 100 miles' from where the corn is grown to where its processed...

...so, again, unless politics intervenes, it simply doesn't make sense to make plants 'large scale'...  ...even *with* energy-dense crops.

But, to apply this to OP's article, this is why crops *like* switchgrass make so much sense per Africa... ...*esp* as its still in its 'earlier years' (for a continent that's the birthplace of our species) .. but, well, switchgrass caters to larger industrial capacity (ie, multi-mw power plants... ...or higher) all the way down to the backyard villager living off of &lt;$5/day.

Seed is cheap, already, and will only get cheaper the more is grown.. ...its grass, lots of seeds per plant.. ..and less than a handful (of seeds) needed to start a plot.. ...   it's low maintenance, low input, ... ...not a food crop so, can be fertilized with human waste.. ...and, grow quite well off of it actually.. ...filtering runoff from, well, latrines, from upper fields such as to not only stop streams from getting polluted but also 'capturing' any fertilizers that *are* added (human waste included) such as to get better utilization of resources..

...it's grass. so, cut it with a machete or 'good stick'-even... ...break it up, use it for fuel in a standard fire, [biochar cookstove](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/01/130129-biochar-clean-cookstoves/)... ....sell the excess, store it (albeit, they hydrogen will 'evaporate out' the older it gets).. ..or simply chop and drop it to let it decompose on the field adding to the carbon and overall health of the soil.. ...if you want to clear out the old crop and create a bit of a 'fresher one'.. greener, more hydrogen-dense, etc.  But, it's drought tolerant, which seems to cater to much of Africa, and it helps to build soils.. ..so, retains water that helps *mitigate* drought conditions.

But, again, not just ['three stones'-villagers](http://www.appropedia.org/Three_stone_cooking_fire), but all the way up to a 'moonshot scale' talked about at a Google talk.. ...Africa-alone almost, let alone the rest of the world (france, ukraine, US, india, china, australia, etc) have enough arable land to grow enough switchgrass to meet the demands of the btu/joules demand of the human race... and then some.  Not just from a transport fuel / ethanol capacity.  but *all* uses.. ..transportation, heating/cooling, electrical generation, etc.

Not that an extreme such as this is needed, per se, but, possible... ..along the same lines as those 'global capacity for wind energy is 72tw' or something articles that were published a decaded ago.. ..just to 'see how much' (using current technology).  

but, it requires valuation of cofactors..  ...heat, carbon negativity, biochar, soil building, water retaining, co2 sequestering, various environmental mitigations, value to the local economies, etc.  and, not necessarily in some 'go local' hippy commune sort of way. The metrics are there w/out *any* carbon pricing. Just like activated carbon for water filtration has a global average of ~$1/lb (even in industrial quantities... ...barge loads, and, multiple of them per contract).. ...biochar, too, has value.  ...as do the benefits from utilizing it (faster to harvest, increased yields, minimized inputs (water, fertilizer, pesticides, ...labor, time/energy, etc)..  ...and, arguably, it has so within the metrics of a simple 'carbon emissions limit'.  whereby, limit or neutralize the carbon emitted from 'anything'.. ..in such that you can't just open-burn coal and spew out whatever may rise from the smokestack.. ...and, well, fine anyone that exceeds it.. ...but, not trade. meaning, there's no need to 'put a price on carbon'.  ie, biochar can (arguably) sit on its own with*out* carbon credits.. ..it's simply valuable enough in &amp; of itself.

[May 2016](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/13315/small-scale-biomass-gasification-plant-progressing-in-california)

um... In short, there aren't a lot.  ...to take it farther, not only is there 'not a lot', a bunch that've been set up per biomass gasification-directly have been shut down.. ..usually due to economics.

It isn't the most cost effective path vs incineration/combustion, and with energy prices being what they are today, the economic viability simply isn't competitive w/out secondary products fully utilized.

But, to take it a bit farther, that's per direct-gasification facilities, or plants specifically built around gasification as the key piece of their energy 'production'.  Ie, build a plant dedicated to gasification in such that the feedstock gets shipped in, feedstock is gasified, syngas produced is incinerated, electricity is the output.  100% dedication like that is essentially all small scale and seen as their own project-types and/or are advertised as their own 'super projects' or whatever per 'greening coal' or company x trying to green city y with plant z.. ...and, those are usually relatively small scale.  In the single digit or extremely low-digit MW range at best.

That's not how gasification is 'really done', and it's done quite often.. ...the world over.  It's really relative to 'lots of things', the market, the municipality, the availability of economically viable feedstocks.   Say company x (ex: Waste Management) has a lot of waste. Their landfill capacity is diminishing, and predicted rate of waste will put their more-local capacity landfill at being filled in 'a decade' (for some arbitrary future date far-enough out, but not that far out all things considered).   Also, lets say there's increased pressure by the local community, the state, and company presence in general to 'green its image', as well, mounting costs from methane emissions.

So, they'll build a digester.  Start structuring their landfill projects as gasifiers to help 1) speed up decomposition of waste (increased room, for one) and 2) extraction of methane such that they aren't leaking it into the environment (increased public scrutiny, expensive, possible 'waste' of otherwise relatively easily extracted energy value, etc      ......  so they set up future storage of waste for the plant as a giant anaerobic digester.. ..and, utilize the gas to produce power onsite for normal plant/landfill operations as well, selling excess power out to the local grid for surrounding businesses / industry.. ...intra-city landfills and the like tend to be low-demand per living around, but surrounded by other industries using the cheaper land prices as well 'whatever' infrastructure the city sets up around these places.. ..powerlines, water lines, waste removal, etc.  So tie-ins there.

Expand it out, this decade gives them enough time to not just 'eek out' most of the waste per the landfill via digestion, but once that's more or less 'tapered out' (initial years are much more 'potent', understandably, than later ones).. ..the landfill will have settled much more and any space gains from this will taper off.. ..so, accelerate the waste by teaming up with the city for a more aggressive recycling program. From here, a pre-sorting effort is done before it gets stored in landfill to begin with (by consumers at home, businesses, or simply operations established once the 'waste' gets delivered by garbage truck).   From here, long story short, it may make sense to set up a gasification facility (via pyrolysis), which allows for a much greater reduction in waste, sorting of waste, and, as such, longer life for the landfill (with ever-increasing land values as the city presumably grows around it).

The local 'whatever' (waste management company) *may* run a PR stunt per this.. ...local ads, possibly some national or international press in specific specialty mags but, for the most part, they're fairly hush hush about it. A lot of reasons for this but one of them is that people simply.don't.care. It's waste.  So, shy of some David Wolfe f.book post picture about how Sweden has so little waste due to their 'efficiency in waste management' that they have to import waste from surrounding countries just to keep operations going... ..  ie, makes you feel good until you realize its incinerated. .. 

...to add to that, it isn't just that 'nobody cares' , it's that when people *do* start caring, it can set up zoning issues, issues with locals, issues with groups within the city that want funds directed elsewhere, etc etc.  ([having a harder time finding links per the coverage around this and why it was cancelled](http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/centralwest/2015/08/13/west-louisville-foodport-plans-canceled/31620331/) ... ...they've done a pretty good job at 'scrubbing' search results per PR... ..the overall food port *being* a big PR stunt. but, it was a 'controversy'. People bitched, complained, went on for months, ultimately was so effective it got shut down.)
People simply don't like this sort of thing so, the quieter such things are done, the better.. ..for the most part.

Next aspect, proprietary tech. Though the companies installing the infrastructure would prefer the press, selling the product, etc.. ..again, ends up in specialty mags and 'other'.  At that, though much of it is 'off the shelf', a lot of it isn't.. ..and is designed or at least built project-specific.  As such, not much *to* advertise, as well, the project wants to remain hush hush about it so.. ...an NDA is signed when the sale is made such as to *keep* it quiet.

Throw on expansion intentions.  Company has y waste-quantity coming in, but can handle y+10% with ability to expand y out to more processing units at that... ...and, there's '10 years of waste in landfill-site-z there' for a unit that has a 30 year lifespan.  They will keep up with the estimated 5% growth (pretty large growth) in waste generated, as well, want / will-need / have a deal brokered with city/county so expand operations (ie, someone's getting kickbacks).. ...the way to do this? buy waste from surrounding landfills and have it shipped in.  Then turn the landfill site into a park or neighborhood.. ...that someone's making money off of.  So, don't let landfill company B know that A has plans/intentions of buying them out in 5 years or 10 years or 'whenever'.. ...Company B may jack up the price a few hundred K or a few million just because they can.. ..and, politician / department has interests in seeing this done, so instead of operations remaining as they normally would per company b's landfill, they start policing them harder, more fines here, greater scrutiny there. Increasing the cost &amp; pressures of operating the landfill.. ...in such it simply because easier, more-profitable, and possibly even *cheaper* to just 'dump' the landfill to someone else for less money.. ...

...see what I mean by 'nobody cares'?  This isn't a sexy business. It's fucking trash/waste.  ..but, there's money in it. and, where there's money there's indiscretion in discussion per it.

back out of *alllllll* of that... ...but, using all of that as an example...

whether it's landfill, whether it's 'waste' in general, whether it's coal... ...or petroleum refinery.. ..or tar sands, or shale, or... ... gasification technology is included in their normal operations.  Take local water utility. .. ...pretty much *all* of them.  ... across the planet.  One thing they'll all (most?) have in common is the use of activated carbon at least *some*where during normal filtration.. ...whether it's a smaller step per a desal plant (where the water's already pretty pure post reverse osmosis), or whether it's a large portion of all the water from the local lake or river is filtered through a.c. at some point.. ...water companies tend to use a '*fuck*load' of activated carbon... 

...They get it from primarily two sources 1) waste coconut shells (ie, [biomass](/r/biomass)/[biochar](/r/biochar).)  and, since, as you can imagine, there aren't enough coconut shells in the world to meet demand... ..2) gasified coal.

So, take the standard Brita or Pur water filter.. the 'black stuff' at the bottom of a fish tank, etc... that's activated carbon. It's *predominately* gotten through the pyrolytic gasification of coal. But, these aren't run as 'standalone' gasification plants, they're simply sub-units of larger coal plant facilities. The [syngas](/r/syngas) is usually/generally just mix-pumped into the gas stream along with the incinerated coal as a 'gas boost'.. ..or burned separately in a n.gas-like turbine/generator also at the facility.

In short, I suppose the best way to say it is: unless a company, local/state/country gov't wants to make a point of announcing some sort of deal in the attempt to 'look green' (ie, 'green coal' per China, for example), it simply isn't something that's covered... *any*way.. ..throw in 'competition' and/or 'local activism' and it's covered all the less.

But, 'gasification' is *nothing* new, happens naturally anyway (forest/prairie-grass fire per pyrolysis, simple 'composting' of fallen leaves in a forest not touched by humans in 'centuries' per anaerobic digestion).. ...and happens constantly across the planet in facilities integral to civilization maintaining its current way of life (coal to biomass to shale/tar sands/ petroleum refining, etc).  ..it just isn't a 'sexy subject' so it isn't covered.. ...unless in industry-specific 'things' or as some PR stunt for 'greening the world', which can just as often blow up in its face given the 'wrong' activists. (or the right ones, still gotta *mine* the coal *to* gasify it).

It's a grass not a tree... ...so it has a relatively finite height ([image 1](https://www.qdma.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=17469&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1262880942), [image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Miscanthus_Bestand.JPG), [image 3](http://www.ethanolproducer.com/uploads/posts/magazine/resize/1328-1292434727-300x300-noup.jpg?1429150308)) and depth ([image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Switchgrass_roots.jpg), [image 2](http://www.mass.gov/eea/images/czm/stormsmart/factsheets/3-7-425.png), [image 3](http://www.groundtradesxchange.com/forums/attachments/landscaping-design/3495d1238362111-should-all-types-grass-outlawed-landscaping-design-npgp5_rootsys.gif)).

Cutting it actually forces it to grow again.  There are different types of switchgrass, the 'more-impressive' images are from the varieties being bred for energy production.. ...much advancement has happened since focus was shifted towards 'grasses for fuel/grassoline' in ~2008. ... ...ie, when [this article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/grass-makes-better-ethanol-than-corn/) was published.  It takes about a year to establish, so it's not harvested the first year, but after that it 'puts out forever'. .. .. optimal years of natural strains per energy density &amp; growth rate are ~7-9.  Best to let it go to seed at least once around the 5th years.   But, that was for natural varieties.. ..even the most aggressive natural strains could put out 'quality product' for about 11 years.. ...lasting longer, but the aging plant simply doesn't perform as well.  Let it grow to seed once ever ~5 years and let the seeds naturally fall during harvesting (vs intentionally harvesting the seeds as well) will allow for new generations to grow and crowd out the older ones.

The 2012 varieties that were bred for ethanol production were getting in the 12-15 EROEI vs corn level, and the 2015 varieties are doing even better... EROEI of around 18.. ..in field trials. ..and I've read in controlled greenhouse &amp; lab conditions they're even getting up to 20-24 EROEI vs an acre of corn.. ..and these are for non-GM'd varieties.  Continued aggressive breeding may take it even higher but, from last I've heard, the push is for more resiliency with the energy density having gotten high enough to be more than economically viable, and improvements coming from even *more* drought tolerance, *more* aggressive growth on even more sub-par lands, and 'other traits'..

That said, it's still a developing industry but Blade's Sunburst strain would do quite well [anywhere in N.America](http://plants.usda.gov/maps/large/PA/PAVI2.png) ... with other strains doing better the farther south (Mississippi to equatorial areas).

Point is though, back to your response...

Generally speaking, switchgrass has an ~60/40 ratio of below:above ground. So, say, grass grows 8ft tall, it'll have 12ft deep roots.. ..and, as you can see from the pictures, though the *stalk* of each root isn't as thick as the grass itself, it has many many 'fibers' that ultimately are even more carbonaceous than the stalk itself.. ...

as the grass above is cut (down to about 3-6""), there is no longer enough 'green' left over for photosynthesis to manufacture/provide the sugars for the soil microbes (fungi, bacteria, etc).. ...as such, they die back and stop exchanging nutrients with the roots.  as a result, the roots, too, start dying back. The plant starts cauterizing the roots to a sustainable level per what remains above ground of the plant.. ...once stability is achieved (ie, enough of the roots have died back at the rate the grass above has started growing back to provide for more photosynthesis).. ..the process will begin again.

The roots cauterized back decompose ('compost') in the soil adding to it. Since ~98%+ of the carbon in a plant is atmospheric carbon (ie, CO2), then that means that this carbon is now sequestered in the soil, decomposing/composting, building yet more soil, rereleasing its nutrients into the soil, and adding to SOC levels (soil organic carbon). 

The plant naturally starts growing up again to go back to seed.   

If left alone? If just grown and left to remain tall? It wouldn't grow up again.  It isn't a tree, it's grass.  The act of harvesting it makes it more carbon-negative, *more* soil-building, and *more* beneficial. 

The harvested part of the plant produces biochar.  Biochar remains molecularly stable for at least 100 years, and studies imply longer... thousands to tens of thousands even. The more biochar added to the same soil, the [deeper into the soil the biochar goes](http://www.biochar-international.org/files/graphics/terra-preta.jpg) as new layers of soil are added atop the previous ones.   The deeper the biochar, the longer it lasts.. ..the less microbial activity to break it down.   Thus, the longer the carbon remains sequestered.

But, it isn't *until* harvesting that biochar can be produced.  ...and, as you can see from [this site](http://biochar.info/biochar.biochar-overview.cfml), biochar increases rate of growth, health of plant, and size of crop. This applies to switchgrass as much as it applies to corn and other food-crops.

Biochar is molecularly stable in *extreme* conditions.. ...pH's far lower than nitric acid (fertilizer) and agitated far more aggressively and for far longer than natural soil conditions would provide don't break down. It's incredibly long-lasting.. ..so, even if the fields were treated with non-organic fertilizers, and the soil built was 'burned back', the biochar layer would remain and from that layer the soil could rebound more quickly.

For every pound of biochar added to the soil, two additional pounds of carbon will be sequestered.. ...within limits of ~33% biochar by volume.  1 part is from increased soil carbon (roots, fungi, microbes, etc) and another is increase growth in the plant itself.   So, the more biochar used, the more carbon is sequestered (to a point), and the longer that carbon remains in the soil.  

If the material *skips* the anaerobic digestion step of the process and went straight to pyrolysis, in an industrial designed unit properly designed for optimal efficiency, &gt;85% of the carbon in the feedstock (switchgrass in this case) is converted into biochar.. ...that's 85% of the carbon that's sequestered 'locked' into a molecularly stable solid form of carbon that lasts at least a century, and most likely much much longer.

The remaining C that is gasified along with the hydrogen makes up the syngas.. ...CO+H2+H2O basically.  The CO can be stepped up to CO2 via a standard catalytic converter, the NxOx's can be converted to N2 &amp; O2, and they can be separated out.. ..H2 can provide hydrogen for 'whatever' purpose (fuel cells, generators, etc) and the CO2 &amp; N2 ... and H2O can be sorted, condensed, and used to feed greenhouses.  [example 1](https://powergen.gepower.com/applications/co2-fertilization.html), [example 2](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120822005895/en/GE-Houweling%E2%80%99s-Tomatoes-Unveil-Greenhouse-Combined-Heat), [example 3](http://site.ge-energy.com/prod_serv/products/recip_engines/du/cogen_systems/co2_fertilization.htm)...

Assuming [diazotrophic[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph)-rich biological fertilizers, such as [SumaGrow](http://www.sumagrow.com) ([image](http://www.agribioticproducts.com/images/Slide2.jpg), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRHnnYsTNio)) are used along with the switchgrass and other crop-types, the N2 feeds the diazatrophs which sequester it into the soil and make it available for the crops. The CO2 is sequestered and increases the growth rate, health, and yield of the crops, the water is recycled into the greenhouses.. ..and, well, this would not only make the process carbon negative from the biochar produced, but carbon-neutral from the CO2 fertilization, and, ultimately, carbon-negative as those healthier plants continued to grow removing yet more naturally available atmospheric carbon levels.

The 'waste heat' from the pyrolysis process that *isn't* used to dry incoming switchgrass for pyrolysis, can be used to help heat the greenhouse during colder seasons.. ..to extend growing seasons in areas that aren't optimal year-round.

In the end, the whole process isn't just carbon neutral, it's carbon negative.. ..and, harvesting it *increases* the rate at which it is, for, again, it isn't *until* its harvested that the biochar can be made, soil can be build (from decomposing roots), and subsequent growths can sequester yet more carbon.

Given the history of the industry though, it is, imo, incredibly difficult to *separate* the two. I mean, they go hand-in-hand with older designs.

I disagree here too.. ...though, i agree with your sentiment of both.. ..but, I think it very much allows for a much '*truer*' potential of nuclear energy's possibilities.  Imagine: turning swords into plowshares .. .. weapons with the capability of 'ending the world' into the fuel in which we build what's next.  

I'm *extremely* pro-nuclear.. ..as such, I probably know more than the average person.. ..but, those making it to /r/nuclear .. .and remaining for long enough to really have an impact of the views of the 'average /r/nuclear subscriber' is probably minimal at best. 

I think *most* are probably here because they're advocates for the industry. Covering the history of the industry allows it to 'disentangle itself' *from* the warmongering that it went through during its more formative years.   *and*, this disentanglement allows for it to take root in a both its past *and* future of peaceful use. 

splitting hairs, but, at the same time, though the sub is *primarily* focused on nuclear energy, it is named 'nuclear' .. ..so, in the broadest sense, this includes 'other' as well. ",2016-07-22 00:58:47+00:00,d5lqnvb,3.0,t1_d5larcj,22657.0,nuclear

..but, the metrics work quite nicely via a much cheaper pipeline.

Let's say you also have a lot of n.gas to go along with your oil, but the same basic problem.

Now let's say all your neighbors have oil too.. ..so they don't really need your stuff, nor want you to pump your stuff through their country and into a neighboring country of them....ie, their customers, ie, making you competition.

but, there's this really juicy market [just to the northwest of you](http://blog.curry.com/images/2012/02/07/gasSupplyAndDemand.jpg)... ...and, all you gotta do is go through a few countries where all but one are on board with you building a pipeline through them.

Let's say your neighbor to the south *also* has a shitload of oil &amp; gas, way more than even you.. ... as well 'trillions' of moneys saved up from their decades of highly profitable sales.. ...and they have your back, esp since they're going to be able to tie into this pipeline and sell *their* stuff along with you.

Would you let a little shit kicker country to the north of you stand in your way? Or would you do what you needed to do to get that fucker into a compliant position to allow this to happen?

You bomb the shit out of that country, you hold *its* neighbor to the north to its word, keep it in place, and build your pipeline through the necessary countries (Turkey-included) and get it to those markets.. ...in the process, rescuing them from their decades of monopolistic oppression by those 'filthy reds'.

...and, in good fashion, you don't do this openly.  you don't *admit* to doing it.  you do it as a response.  you intimidate &amp; provoke into response  ..  ..*then* you can respond in such a way that will let you move forward with your agenda.",2016-07-19 20:57:15+00:00,d5io1oj,1.0,t3_4tkncq,34253.0,energy

I lived on the 18th floor of a building with an unopenable window in Phoenix for a bit.

321,"&gt; You called them 'ticking time bombs' in the first post I responded to.

...and they are. Especially as we continue to embrace an industry that bases itself on 'antiquated' approaches towards its 'average m.o.' which has been *proven* to be horribly inefficient.. ..and, in doing so, continue to produce ever-increasing quantities of waste that, in turn, continue to fill spent fuel pools beyond their original design perimeters and intentions. The pools are aging, filled beyond intended design, and increasing on their likelihood that yet-more will go wrong with them.  You also responded to my initial comment per spent fuel pools with the materials being stored there temporarily *then* moved to dry cask. This has only happened with 22% of the material created.. ...which, as you showed, said material *isn't* all necessary nor even 'ready' to be moved over to dry cask (read: it's still doing as is originally intended 'to cool for a period of 10-20 years').  So, of the 78% of material that *hasn't* been moved to dry cask, only a percentage of that is even 'ready' to be.. ...but, w/out numbers in front of me, I'd be willing to wager that the percentage that is 'ready to move' (to dry cask) is higher than the percentage that's not-yet-ready.

Point: the situation is beyond original design perimeters and intentions and is only going to continue to be that way until longer term solutions are embraced.. ...the first of which would be 'simply' to move it to dry cask.  ...a longer term solution would be to then move said casks to a more centralized facility designed for longer-term storage (*like* Yucca Mountain... though, I more-prefer the salt storage facilities in the southeastern US due to their hundred+ million years of geological stability combined with their two-hundred and fifty million year *projected* geological stability.. ...as well, the natural function of salt to 'heal' if-ever a geologic even *did* strike near or directly onto them. (salt 'heals' itself.. which I'm sure you know).

The problem with that is, due to political reasons (steered &amp; driven by the populations there), Louisiana &amp; Mississippi, like California per the Diablo Canyon site, don't *want* nuclear 'anything' there.. ...and, as such, the ideas of storing it there have been shot down and met with continued resistance. 

Even then, it's also 'silly' to store much of the material there, quite simply because much of said material still has potential of being utilized as fuel.. ..esp if used in reactor-types designed *to* (more efficiently) utilize it *as* fuel (with minimal reprocessing.. if any?)... ...and, in the process, reduce its dangers drastically.  ...but, this requires moving forward with projects based around these designs, and this is unfortunately less likely if the 'old way of doing things' is still pushing to do things 'the old way'.

***
&gt; You, literally, have chemicals under your sink more dangerous than that leak.

no doubt! and, as you pointed out, that are more difficult to detect vs simply using a geiger counter to narrow down where any of the leaked materials are such that they can be dealt with accordingly.

&gt; That level of harm happens ten thousand times a year at industrial sites around the country,

unfortunately, yes. but those aren't the topics being focused on so to start *to* focus on them is to jump topics in such a way that it allows the ability to 'excuse' *these* accidents from happening by comparison.

&gt; the only difference is it will be chemicals. 

I thought you'd established previously that radioactive materials *were* 'chemicals'. Why now are you choosing to differentiate?

&gt; This doesn't excuse the leak, but it does put it into perspective.

Perspective wasn't really needed, as the perspective of those other industries' environmental catastrophe's are enough their 'own thing' that they merit their own discussions.. ..so, unless referencing those in such as to reference how those accidents were mitigated is, essentially, 'scapegoating'.

&gt; Demanding perfection is irrational. We expect that of absolutely no other industry.

Who's demanding perfection?  First, I'm merely pointing out that these systems *are* inherently flawed, and, thus *not* track record-free of breeches in intended perimeters. Next, I have no doubt that *any* industry will be wrought with problems... including 'next-gen nuclear industry' which I argue *for*..   it, too, will have plenty of problems to be addressed, but I'm of the opinion that they'll be much more inline with others in the (energy) industry.. ...esp given that they're all but necessary at this point in order to clean up from the (nuclear) industry in its current form.

Human's exist, therefore we alter the environment around us *regardless* of how we choose to (or don't) exist within it. I'm not anti-human nor anti-'life' in general. I'm just of the opinion that there are 'better ways' we can move forward.

&gt; Yes, accidents happen. Your policy seems to be that there is no acceptable level of accidents, that any possibility of harm is too much.

No, that isn't my 'policy'. My *opinion* is that the acceptable levels of accidents are too high when they're concerning an industry that acknowledges that it doesn't have a long term solution in place.. ..via its current incarnation.  As such, shut it down *in* its current form... ...or take steps *towards* shutting it down.. ...while also taking steps towards 'starting up' a new 'version' of the industry that *does* address these.. ..again, ie, reactor designs that both more-efficiently utilize their feedstocks &amp; help reduce the byproducts of the earlier version of the industry. ...as, again, is all but necessary at this point.

&gt; I'd agree with you if this was an ongoing problem, 

you don't really need to. people's in greater power than either of us (and positions to do something with it) already recognize this.. ..hence why reports &amp; studies exist *to* be referenced to begin with.

&gt; if there were constant deaths and homes and lives destroyed, but there isn't. 

...yet, the potential for such still exists, and increases constantly.. ...and, 'enough' incidents *have* happened already (unfortunately) to give precedent for increased concern.

&gt; If these spent fuels were even a hundredth as bad as the billion tons of fly ash sitting around, yes, they'd be a serious concern.

No reason to bring [coal](/r/coal) into this.  ...but, very little of it do I really see a benefit in utilizing either. ...and *neither* industry (coal nor nuclear) are economically viable if 'properly' regulated.  ...and, at the end of the day, I think that was a major part taken into consideration per the agreement to shut down Diablo Canyon.

&gt; Do you know of any biological process that creates a neutron flux?

not yet.. ...but the drive, push, and chances of discovering one seem to be increasing 'daily' as advancements in the field continue.  It's an exciting time to be alive, imo. New discoveries are constantly being made, and the technologies we have available and that are coming online are making it all the easier to work with and all the likelier to find one if one exists... ..and, to possibly create one if it doesn't.

Uranium isn't really the issue anyway. ..it's 'fuel', if reprocessing laws allow it to be.   Again, really recommend checking out Sorensen's google-talk. He did a really good job with it.  I 'get' your point.  I'm not arguing against pools, they're necessary for *any* nuclear design from what I gather. ...and, again, I *am* 'pro-nuclear'. I'm just not a big fan of the industry in its current incarnation.  I also side with the NRC &amp; congress in seeing that nuclear waste is a pretty big problem, and one that isn't adequately addressed.. ..and with no easy path forward. Thus, the less of it we make, the better off we'll be. ...esp if making it *means* 'making it' utilizing shit-efficient reactor designs.

Oh, and [this article](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/radioactive-leaks-found-at-75-of-us-nuke-sites/) popped up on a newsfeed earlier.. wasn't even looking for it. ..seems applicable.   but, I don't think we're really in disagreement on whether or not 'dams' can break.

&gt; No. It depends entirely on the leak.

yet, to quote the article above's referencing the AP's investigation

&gt; At the three-unit Browns Ferry complex in Alabama, a valve was mistakenly left open in a storage tank during modifications over the years. When the tank was filled in April 2010 about 1,000 gallons of tritium-laden water poured onto the ground at a concentration of 2 million picocuries per liter. In drinking water, that would be 100 times higher than the EPA health standard.

...before taking this where I'm going with it...

&gt; Radioactive is not a synonym for 'bad'.

Totally agree. I consume plenty of radioactive substances ...daily.  'Most' people do (all?).. ..as I imagine it's all but impossible not to.  Me, though? I do it intentionally. I actually buy into the whole 'radiation can be healthy' arguments. Outside of the subject focus so I won't go into it, but I'm not convinced that cancer is 'caused' by radiation, but more a byproduct of exposure to it.. ...in such to say, 'radiation isn't the issue', per se.  At that, I'm not going to take a dip in a spent fuel pool regardless of [how safe](https://www.quora.com/Nuclear-Reactors-What-happens-if-someone-fell-in-the-spent-fuel-pool) it [most likely is](https://what-if.xkcd.com/29/)... ...from a shielding perspective.  Nor do I think it's a good idea to see spent fuel pools as a safe long term storage, as the current policy in the US seems to utilize them as being. On top of that, I'm not naive enough to believe that there aren't problems with them, and that making more of them, or increasing the quantity of material stored in them isn't going to increase the likelihood of yet-more accidents with them happening... ...which, if the AP investigation is to be believed, are pretty much ongoing, right now, as we speak, radioactive material is leaking into the surrounding environment from a spent fuel *despite* design specs being such as to avoid this.  Accidents happen.. constantly.

&gt; There are safe levels, unsafe levels that are practically speaking no big deal, and dangerous levels.

you forgot to add 'healthy levels'.

&gt; They get energy from natural radioactive decay. They don't transmute the material. Its still radioactive.

I've been reading a bit about biological transmutation lately.  I'm not entirely convinced that biology *isn't* capable of transmutation.. ..and am eager to see advancements in the understanding of this.  In fact, I've read enough at this point about it that I'm just about at the point that I'd be willing to place wager that it not only 'is-possible', but that it 'does-happen', and, regularly. ...and is even a relatively integral part to the life cycle of many organism-types.  but, 'just about at the point' means I'm not quite there yet.. ..I need to research it a bit more.

But, I see a *lot* of potential in the field of utilizing fungi, algae, bacteria ...'biomass' ... towards an accelerated reduction of the breakdown of radioactive material. It's a bit 'fringe', but, again, I'm of the opinion that biological transmutation *does* happen.. ..bioremediation is an interesting subject to me. 

Regardless, it isn't 'there' yet (our understanding of it at least), that reduces it back ot the rest of where I was going with that: burn the material up in reactors designed to 'burn the material up' and, in the process, get a helluva lot more energy out of them (the materials) in the process.. ..but, not using today's reactor designs, because they're horribly inefficient and producers of a lot of ~~potentially~~ really dangerous waste that the industry nor our government is properly regulating. ..and, if they were, it would reduce the economic viability of nuclear vs 'alternatives' all the lower than it currently is.",2016-06-30 23:49:11+00:00,d4uos06,11.0,t1_d4tw4cb,38800.0,energy

335,"&gt; This is true of anything.

..including nuclear reactors and spent fuel pools.  Thank you for at least acknowledging.

&gt; Dams can break, bridges can fall, buildings can collapse. 

Dams *do* break. Bridges *do* fall. Buildings *do* collapse. Their effects vary in impact per the dam, bridge, and building but.. ..let's reword it: dams do leak.  not only do they 'break', (which I read as a 'full collapse') but they also simply leak.  So do pools.  

The difference is, a dam tends to dam natural bodies of water... ..or unnaturally created bodies of water that people spend recreational time in.. .. if they leak and the water they contain goes downstream and 'floods' someones yard.. ...does their yard stay radioactive for very long afterwards? (given that *some* shred of radioactive material is natural).   

now, what is a pool but a dam on 5 sides?   and, like you said, dams *do* 'break' ... and, in this case, 'breaking' could also mean simply leaking.

It isn't whether or not they do, it's the impact if/when they do, and a major part of that impact is the ability to contain it as well the length of time that impact will remain a health hazard.

People are *still* having health issues from the WTC towers collapsing.. ...due to building materials used at the time. We have regulations in place that limit the quantity of those materials currently allowed to be used for large buildings.. ...why? because the industry (and its regulations) have advanced and kept up with the times.

I'm not saying to go tear down the Empire State Building because it may contain some asbestos ... ...nor am I saying to shut down 40 year old reactors simply because they 'could' breach containment and fail beyond design standards.. ..though, I *do* think it'd be better to begin to radically transition our nuclear industry over to something that's of a more advanced nature ... whereby that 'advanced nature' includes reducing the amount of waste produced, as well the longevity that that waste remains dangerous.. ..esp when it means a more efficient plant that 'burns up' much larger quantities of the material otherwise known as 'fuel'.

&gt; You'll note that all of these things have killed far more people than spent fuel pools, which, to date, have not killed anyone. The potential energy they store is in a pretty stable configuration.

'pretty stable', yes. but as even those in the industry acknowledge, let alone those regulating it... it could be *more* stable.  and, well, what's more stable than simply not producing more of it to begin with?

&gt; but the unburned uranium isn't disappearing.

I didn't realize that uranium didn't decay? do you have something to back this up? That uranium doesn't have a half-life?

asshole'ed'ness aside, Sorensen gave a really good talk at Google back in 2010 on nuclear waste.. ...the whole video's worth rewinding and watching from the beginning, imo, but [this should link](https://youtu.be/rv-mFSoZOkE?t=335) you to the part where he goes through the time period breakdowns of waste from reactors. Really interesting, he did a good job with it.  but, again, the whole video's worth watching if you haven't before. 

([his other video at google was really good too](https://youtu.be/AZR0UKxNPh8) .. I put it in my top 3 or 4 google tech talk videos I've seen.. ..bussard and mike chieky being the other two.. .. i kinda liked the video above better than this one, only because I think he's given better talks on thorium before than this one... but, if you have '2 hours' or combine his '2hrs' into one video.. then iThem are in the top three)

&gt; Of course better reactor technologies would be better. If nothing else, transitioning to a non pressurized reactor would have a whole host of safety(and hence cost) benefits. But what we have now works pretty damned well, pretty damned safely. Don't let the idea of having something perfect blind you from having something good enough.

never would (blind me), nor am i blind enough to think that there's anything 'perfect'.. ...but, I'd argue that more of the dangers from the nuclear industry come from its 'waste' than from the reactor designs themselves.. ....and 'good enough' in this case, quite simply, isn't 'good enough' in my opinion.  ...that depending, of course, on what you're referring to as *being* 'good enough'?

&gt; Why? Its not like there's mountains of this stuff, or that any leak at all is equal to a full and complete release that spreads to every corner of the earth.

I would find it pretty unlikely if any 'mountain' weighed 50k tonnes or less. so, no, I *don't* think there are 'mountains' of it. ... but, you have to admit, that a leak from a spent fuel pool would be a bit worse than leak from an overflowing dam or the oil in a solar thermal facility's lines... or a wind turbine.  or, hell, even the fluid(s) used in geothermal coils.  .... or even a leak in a tanker shipping petro or n.gas across the gulf.

It doesn't have to spread to 'every corner of the earth' like coal, n.gas, and petro emissions have.. ..to still have an impact.. ...and a pretty substantial one at that.

336,"&gt; After ten years, the water behind a dam will still kill you if the dam breaks.

yeah, but is it radioactive? would you drink it? bathe in it?  Not really a balanced comparison.
***
&gt; Yeah. So? The pools aren't full yet, there's literally no reason to move them out.

[Intro section of this](http://issues.org/28-2/alvarez/): 

""It is estimated that spent-fuel storage pools at U.S. reactors, which are already jammed, will hit maximum capacity by 2015.""

""Because they were intended to be temporary, the pools do not have the same “defense in depth” features that the NRC requires of reactors""

There're about a dozen other lines from the article I could copy &amp; paste but, quite simply, I recommend just reading the article. It's a 'good read' in my opinion.

That said, It isn't that they aren't full, it's that they're *over*filled essentially. They weren't nor aren't designed for long term storage. They weren't designed that way, and Congress has even passed laws (that they later changed) to accelerate a longer term solution be found and.. ...it hasn't. It's a problem. It's been a problem. It's going to continue to be a problem, and that problem is only going to continue to grow the longer we keep running reactors that produce material that's store in pools.. ...until a longer term solution is agreed upon and implemented. 

Arguably my favorite part of the article is near the beginning of it with this quote:

&gt; “Large-scale commercial reprocessing never materialized in the United States,” the utility, Dominion Power, said. “As a result, operating nuclear sites were required to cope with ever-increasing amounts of irradiated fuel . . . This has become a fact of life for nuclear power stations.”

'reprocessing never materialized'.  This needs to be fixed.

To go back to the original line of thought you put forth in that it's stored in pools then moved to dry cask storage. ... ...I'm all for dry cask storage. It 'works'. ...but that simply isn't happening, hasn't been happening, hasn't happened, and, until a major change in policy is put in place, isn't likely to happen. ...and even then, the policy will likely be changed as it has been in the past.

Industry produces waste. Be it ag or livestock with fertilizer runoff or cow piss to the bio-plastic cup that contains my slush puppy to the car company manufacturing the cup holder it sits in.   There is 'lots of money' in 'greening' a business's production model / manufacturing line. It's high time the nuclear industry embrace this... because, quite simply, as the article states, these pools weren't intended for long term storage.
***
&gt; Sellafield is a remnant of the 50s/60s and the nuclear weapons program.
If I brought up the Love Canal as an example of modern industry practices, would you think it appropriate?

again, to quote the article (first paragraph 'US nuclear portrait' section)

&gt; In the United States, 104 commercial nuclear reactors are operating at 65 sites in 31 states. Sixty-nine of them are pressurized-water reactors (PWRs), and 35 are boiling-water reactors (BWRs). Thirty-one of the BWRs are Mark I and Mark II models that are built on the same basic design as those at the Dai-Ichi site. In addition, there are 14 older lightwater–cooled reactors in various stages of decommissioning.

[Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_Creek_Nuclear_Generating_Station): commissioned: 1969. status: operating Cont version: Mark I

so, seems 'the '60's *do* still apply.   and, well, as of 2012 (article's date), 31 utilize Mark I or II containment which may've first gone into use in 1969 *with* the Oyster Creek facility, but the designs of the Mark I go back nearly a decade before that... which puts it into the '50's.. ...and, well, there were 34 Mark I's built and 19 Mark II's spread through '69 with the Oyster Creek through '84 ... with 9 of those decommissioned or damaged, and even more receiving maintenance.

These are old.. and though no, I wouldn't compare it to 'the love boat', I also wouldn't say that these are 'modern' by any means either.    ...and it's a healthy percentage of our running reactors.


I'm all for 'dry cask storage' and I'm all for nuclear.. ...but our industry is old, dated, inefficient, and long overdue a major overhaul. 

***

&gt; You still haven't explained why a pool is bad?

read the link above. It's a system designed for a short-term solution that's become a long term problem. It is over-filled, under regulated (per reactors themselves), while arguably being just as dangerous, if not more so as they contain *more* radioactive material (in quantity) than the reactors themselves. ...not to mention they've already created problems

in other words, the 'Emphasis on pool safety' section. Even the NRC recognizes the shortcomings.  I'm not saying 'don't use pools', I'm saying, 'use pools, where needed, then transition to using up the rest of the fuel while also moving the materials to dry cask and then better regulated and safer longer-term storage facilities. ...which essentially don't exist.

[another link for ya](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/05/20/19712/scientists-say-nuclear-fuel-pools-around-country-pose-safety-and-health-risks)

***
&gt; ""Something isn't perfect, therefore its completely unfixable, tear it down and start over.""

I didn't say to 'tear it down and start over'. Let the reactors live out their planned and originally agreed upon lives.. ...and where the communities that those reactors reside in, if the members of that community vote to continue that relationship past it.. ..ie, extend the plant's life via upgrades that obviously meet standards set forth? great! go ahead.  This isn't the case with Diablo Canyon though. The community doesn't want it.. ...*despite* it not having lived out its intended lifespan per it's design and original lease.  You can't '*make*' a community that doesn't want a reactor have a reactor... and in the case of Diablo Canyon specifically, and PG&amp;E in general, the decisions been made.. .. for 'whatever' reason to shut it down and decommission it.

none of this even mentions the hotbed of controversy surrounding Indian Point

***

&gt; You've spent an inordinate amount of time throwing out numbers, but not once have you even attempted to explain why those numbers are bad, you're just expecting me to bend under the weight of zeros.

Apologies, I didn't realize that the five-0's in 10'000 were 'weighty'

I wasn't trying to throw out 'scary numbers' to get you to change your opinion, I was attempting to point out the potential dangers being stored in something that the industry, the commissions, and even congress itself sees as being a problem.

...and, as much as anything, trying to show you that the 'ideal' of it going from spent pools to dry casks simply isn't the majority.. ..for pools that are overfilled or filled beyond their original design intentions &amp; limitations.

It's nice to 'think' this industry is 'nice &amp; clean' but it, like *all* energy industries (solar, wind, geothermal, etc included) have their dirty little secrets. 

&gt; Direct question: Am I more likely to die from a car crash, or a spent fuel pool that has provided me power for my entire life. 

like you said, I obviously know the answer to that question..  ..but, I think there's a *bit* more to it than that, and, like you knowing that *I* 'know' things, I think that *you* 'know' that too.

&gt;  but you still think there's this massive, completely unreasonable danger.

I don't think that it's a 'massive, completely unreasonable danger'.  I think that's it's a stupid danger that could not only be reduced by embracing new reactor designs, but also reduced by helping to clean up the waste from old ones.

&gt; Why? I don't understand this mentality.

maybe because you're projecting it from your own confusion onto me as if it's something that I'm conveying vs reading what I'm conveying.. ...and others are as well: spent fuel and other radioactive material is dangerous. We do a piss poor job at addressing it, and every day the likelihood that something goes wrong continues to increase it.. ...until 'better' approaches are embraced, implemented, and utilized.

&gt; A U.S. Nuclear Regulatory fact sheet states that after 10 years in a cooling pool, the surface radioactivity of a spent fuel assembly is still about 10,000 rem/hour.[iii]   To understand the danger that poses to health, consider that a 500-rem dose delivered to a whole person in a single exposure is fatal.   Close proximity to a single 10-year-old spent fuel assembly would deliver a fatal whole-body radiation dose in about three minutes.


* [NRC: Spent Fuel Storage in Pools and Dry Casks Key Points and Q&amp;A](http://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/faqs.html)

&gt; According to the Congressional Research Service (using NEI data), there were 62,683 metric tons of commercial spent fuel accumulated in the United States as of the end of 2009.

&gt;  a. Of that total, 48,818 metric tons – or about 78 percent – were in pools.

&gt;  b. 13,856 metric tons – or about 22 percent – were stored in dry casks.

&gt;  c. The total increases by 2,000 to 2,400 tons annually.


Let me repeat that for emphasis: 78% of our waste is in pools.... ....not dry casks.  From the NRC's own website.

The clean-up operation, scheduled to end by 2120, costs the government £1.9 billion a year.

...a cleanup operation not scheduled to end for 103+ years from now.  I've *never* known a clean-up project to finish on time nor within budget. If one did, I'd imagine that this would be something that'd be bragged about left &amp; right and, as such, would be all over the place news-wise.  I'll apply that here.

* [Radioactive Wastes - Myths and Realities](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/radioactive-wastes-myths-and-realities.aspx)

&gt; #10   Nuclear waste should be transmuted into harmless materials Transmutation is the process of transforming one radionuclide into another via neutron bombardment in a nuclear reactor or accelerator-driven device. The objective is to change long-lived actinides and fission products into significantly shorter-lived nuclides. The goal is to have wastes that become radiologically harmless in only a few hundred years. Transmutation is not feasible for all of the wastes produced in the past or to be produced. Transmutation may be able to reduce waste quantities but it will do it only to a certain extent and therefore not eliminate the need for disposal. One of the technical issues is to isolate each nuclide (partitioning) so that it can then be irradiated, otherwise the process is likely to create as much waste as it destroys. Even if the economics of partitioning and transmutation were favourable, it is likely that the benefits would not compensate for the burden of additional operations required for separating and transmuting only part of the nuclides.


* [Nuclear Energy Initiative: Nuclear Waste Management](http://www.nei.org/Issues-Policy/Nuclear-Waste-Management)

&gt; Disposal

&gt; Whether nuclear fuel is used only once or recycled for subsequent use, disposal of high-level radioactive byproducts in a permanent geologic repository is necessary. Underground disposal in a specially designed facility is an essential element of a sustainable, integrated used nuclear fuel management program. The industry supports the completion of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's review of the DOE license application to build a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.


but, again, it *isn't* being 'disposed of' underground in long term repositories, let alone even dry casks.  Again, in the US, 78% is still stored in storage pools.


That bumps it back out to 'a solution'

* [How Exactly Do We Handle Nuclear Waste?](http://liquidfluoridethoriumreactor.glerner.com/2012-how-exactly-do-we-handle-nuclear-waste/)

&gt; How do we deal with nuclear waste so it doesn’t harm living beings? A quick answer is “fission all the uranium and transuranic elements, which can be done in a molten salt reactor and a few other kinds of reactor, and then store what’s left until it isn’t dangerous any more. That will take 10 years for most of the waste; for 17% of the waste, it will take 350 years.”

...but, for this to happen, the 'old' nuclear industry has to shutdown and die.  Anything done today towards that is essentially geared towards keeping that old beast inflated and around in current form. In other words, 'Grandma needs to die or at least get outta the whorehouse 'cause the new generation is much much sexier ...and jam packed with a *shit*load of new skills'.

was on my phone earlier.. ...still not going to dedicate much more time to it but...

from [the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spent_fuel_pool) itself's intro section:  In many countries, the fuel assemblies, after being in the reactor for 3 to 6 years, are stored underwater for 10 to 20 years before being sent for reprocessing or dry cask storage. 

10-20 *years* is *not* a short amount of time.  The longer the time, the greater the likelihood that something can go wrong.   Again, I'm [pro-nuclear](/r/nuclear).. ..*very* [pro-nuclear](/r/thorium) [actually](/r/fusion)... definitely more so than pro-[wind](/r/windenergy), pro-[solar](/r/solarenergy), [geothermal](/r/geothermal), [hydroelectric](/r/hydroelectric), or ['other'](/r/renewablenews).   About the only energy source that I'm *more* 'pro-' than nuclear is [biomass](/r/biomass), and even with that, it's largely via very specific crop-types and processing-types.  ([algae](/r/algae), [hemp](/r/hemp), [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass), [gasification](/r/gasification),  [anaerobic digestion](/r/anaerobicdigestion), [pyrolysis](/r/pyrolysis), and, most 'importantly', [biochar](/r/biochar)).  ...otherwise I wouldn't spend so much time, energy, and 'whatever' researching, posting-to, and moderating those subs.

I see a nuclear/biochar-via-biomass hybrid as an ideal future.. ...with the others making up bits &amp; pieces here &amp; there... ...

but, backing away from that.. ...

it isn't that i'm anti-nuclear, it's that I'm pro-nuclear via specific technology- &amp; approach- -types.   By &amp; large, most are bullshit, dangerous, sloppy, inefficient, and so politically motivated that they crowd out more advanced types from seeing the light of day.   They soak up funding, talent/brainpower, market demand, resources, etc.   I'm of the opinion that, well, more or less like Kirk says, (paraphrasing because the quote isn't directly in front of me), 'the entire industry needs to be scrapped and rebooted because what's out there and what could be out there are so drastically 'different' that it'd take a reboot just to get the next level going'   (again, heavily putting my own spin on it but feel the 'essence' is still captured).

...and by me quoting Kirk, that *isn't* me saying that 'thorium' or MSRs are the only way forward.  There are 'lots' of interesting design concepts out there.. ...that not only reduce the amount of '[waste'](/r/waste) produced, but that actually use said 'waste' as fuel sources... ...reducing its quantity and dangers in the process.  (dangers being both proliferation / terrorism... be it dirty bombs or nuke [weapons](/r/weapons) as well as environmental).


Now, it isn't to say that this isn't regulated, and that the nuclear industry isn't *way* ahead of where many other industries should be (both energy-related and 'otherwise')... ...hell, from the [WNA's own website](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/radioactive-waste-management.aspx):  ""Nuclear power is the only large-scale energy-producing technology which takes full responsibility for all its wastes and fully costs this into the product.""  ... bam, right there at the top of it.  [Coal](/r/coal), [n.gas](/r/naturalgas), [petroleum](/r/petroleum), etc... ...hell, even the [biomass](/r/biomass) industry where even biochar production *is* taken into consideration doesn't do this... take it this far.. ..and, as argued many times, the waste from these facilities is arguably even *more* dangerous than the nuclear... ...specifically *because* it ***isn't*** treated with the same respect with which the nuclear industry treats its waste.


I'm not really into old-school pissing contests of one vs the other.. ...despite that actually being the case per the Diablo Canyon shutdown: read a bunch of California environmentalists want to go nuclear-free (the world over, esp in cali) .. ...but, truth is, Cali's been headed that way for quite a while now. This is nothing new.. and, as such, not a quagmire of an argument I really care to get into.  I'm of the opinion that the people that live in an area should, by &amp; large, have a choice in how that area is governed... ...and, esp if that includes building, running, and/or choosing to continue to run a nuclear power plant there.

As 'silly' as I think it is from a generic perspective, California, Germany, 'elsewhere' choosing to go nuclear-free really, honestly, aside from the hippy go luck approach of 'nuclear free world' or 'whatever' deal they justify it with... the truth is, those reactor designs are inefficient and produce a lot of long-lived waste that, given the current political approach governing it, it honestly *is* 'safer' to just shut it down.   

but, unfortunately, it *doesn't* address the 'tens of thousands of years' of material/'waste' they've already generated. and as nice as it'd be to just shove it in the ground somewhere, forget about it, and otherwise 'hope' that it doesn't leak.. ..well, that's naive at best. It needs to be processed, 'burned up', and reduced in quantity and intensity.  ...and, the only way to do that (that I'm aware of) is to feed it to [radiotrophic fungi](http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070521/full/news070521-5.html), [algae](http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/common-pond-algae-can-sequester-high-level-radioactive-waste-strontium-90.html), (maybe some) [bacteria](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/scientists-discover-hazardous-waste-eating-bacteria), or to burn it up in reactor designs that are built *to* 'burn it up' and reduce it.  ...and, simply, that's isn't the case with the Westinghouse designed &amp; build PWRs that Diablo Canyon uses.

But, all that aside... back to your original question, yeah, spent reactor ponds aren't necessarily the 'safest' thing around.  Not that solar, wind, geothermal, etc doesn't have its drawbacks as well.. ...that the 'greenies' try to play down as much as possible.. ...and, hell, leaps in technology in those should be utilized.. ...from new materials for solar, better utilization of solar thermal,... i'm a big fan of VAWTs for wind... way more than HAWTs.. ..and what's going on with biomass per ethanol/biodiesel is 'fucking criminal' as far as i'm concerned.. ...*any*way, esp in comparison to 'better' crop-types that produce higher yields off of less inputs, producing less runoff (if 'any'), and actually *build* [soil](/r/soil) vs destroy it... geothermal's a different subject altogether but 'whatever'... ...and, hydroelectric.. ..are there any rivers worldwide that we *haven't* dammed up?   In this country at least?

360,"The longer something's radioactive, the less radioactive it is. The more radioactive something is, the less time it tends to remain radioactive... ...that whole 'half life' thing.

The more radioactive something is, the more energy it has that we can more-easily harness. The problem is the way we treat radioactive material. If we reprocessed radioactive 'waste' and reused it as fuel, we'd 'burn it up' faster and result in less harmful radioactive material that, sure, may last a while, but is nowhere near as dangerous as the stuff currently being produced. It's a policy issue, not necessarily an environmental one.

A crude way of looking at it is 'differentials': the higher the differential between the material and standard background radiation levels, the more energy it has and, thus, the more energy we can extract from it.   Similar to the higher the temperature vs background/ambient temperatures, the more energy we can extract from this play in differentials.. ...same goes for radioactive material.

The longer-lived stuff is much safer, much more easily &amp; safely stored, and the less useful energy it has. Until available reactor designs changes, until policy changes, and until our view on how to handle nuclear material changes, it'll continue to remain a problem.  I'm pro-nuclear, I'm anti- current nuclear policy &amp; reactor designs.  Truth is though, if we don't develop &amp; start utilizing reactors designed to run on waste reactor fuel, all the 'waste' we've already produced will be sitting around for thousands of years.  It's better to develop and build these reactor designs and use them... vs not.   ...but, it'll take not just a change in policy, but a rebooting of the nuclear industry from a totally different approach than it's currently structure to handle.

so, 'enough' dry stuff to get it going but then you can go wet from there.

but, inside the 'pyramid' will become a 'pocket'... the pyrolysis zone.. ...and, basically, it's an oven. The fire will suck the oxygen in there or released from there quite quickly... and, 'as-'made'' from the heating of the material itself.

Like the marshal said, lot harder to control one than to put one out.. ..and, a regular mist *over* the fire keeps anything flying up and away (to catch surrounding grasses, trees, etc on fire)... a wet day anyway, or just after a rain... ...and, well, the rest is let it burn enough to get the 'oven' going, then squelch it before it gets too big.  it's 'boring' but not at the same time.. ..and, once going? minimal smoke happens.

so... *in* a camp fire (or others), white smoke tends to be water vapor, black is carbon.  The oxygen allows it to burn hotter, as well, allows the C to bind with O and produce CO &amp; CO2.

You can make ...and I've made plenty.. of biochar from open designs. in fact, I can easily say the largest *quantity* of char I've ever made (when all combined together) *is* from open burns.. ...but, it's by no means the highest *quality* char I've made.

Increasing the temperature increases the amount of 'other elements' are 'cooked out' of the char.. (so, more porous).

it also increases the activation of the char (so, helps increase CEC of the char).

It also tends to increase the strength of the C-C bonds of the char.. ...but, *too* hot (&gt;1,250-1500F) and the electrons begin to crystalize... or, form a dipole bond..  

....so, char produced &lt;1,250F tends to be matte black, char above these temperatures tends to crystalize and/or produce a shiny glass-like look to it.  This is less effective for the purpose of a soil amendment, as well, it isn't as activated... ...or, the paramagnetic properties of the char is diminished.

You *can* produce a non-crystalized bond of the carbon (think: 'diamond' if you will) at higher temperatures... but it's 'tricky' and most don't do this.

That's one of the ... *one* of the problems with purchasing biochar: the cheapest stuff tends to be done at very high temperatures utilizing fast pyrolysis.  This is a crack-quick way to extract the energy (hydrogen) from the biomass, but it produces a lower quality char.

Manufacturers will then 'dope the char' (precharge it) with various amendments in an attempt to give it both a 'kick' and some value but... ...you'd be better just buying &amp; using the other additives themselves vs paying the higher prices for the char.

At the same time, lower-T produced char doesn't have the porosity nor the activation.. ..so, even though it doesn't have the crystalized atomic structure (which, granted/admittedly, *will* last a long time.. from a purely carbon sequestration perspective).. it still just 'isn't great char'.

...also, lower-T produced chars tend to still have a lot of VOCs in them... bio-oils and such that will actually serve to *repel* nutrients and water, and, thus, roots/plants, from the char.. ...until these are eventually broken down by natural (usually organic) processes in the soil.  read: the 'bugs eat the voc'

and, even once this happens, again, the char still isn't as porous nor as paramagnetic.

Check out the bottom link in the sidebar of /r/biochar ... It's the only article I keep linked-to in the sidebar because that study more or less 'sums it up'.

Now, to backup.. ...I said *one* of the problems with purchasing biochar.  There're a slew of other ones as well.  ...there're 'tricks' in the industry to either intentionally cover up things and/or, on a less sinister end, to simply compensate for them... or attempt to.  In short, they'll add amendments to it... things like rock dust, compost teas, fertilizers, or simply blend it with compost (Soil Reef, Horizon's biochar product, etc).  

These do a few things but one of which is, well, again,  it could simply be the amendments providing any 'kick', but another is it covers up and removes the ability to 'test the char by itself'.  ....so, on the one hand, you can't be sure what percentage of the product you're purchasing is biochar.. if even very much at all. It *was*/(is-still?) a buzzword for a few years so from a marketing perspective, simply having it on the bag means you can charge more... ...but, it may not even contain 5%... hell, maybe not even 1% by volume... ...but to contain 'any' means that 'biochar' can be added to the label and, as such, a premium price can be charged.

Another is, regardless of percentage of volume added, once its added (with other 'things'), the char itself will 'fill up'.  This is both 'good' from a use-the-product-immediately perspective, but 'bad' from the ability to test the char.   A crack-quick test of char would be to fill up ... 2 red solo cups with char (better if clear glass but...)  one with one type, one with another.  then use a third solo cup (or fixed &amp; measurable volume) filled with water.  pour it into one of the cups... note how much you could pour in there... then, separately, repeat with another.  The more porous the char the more water will absorb into it. The more activated the char, the faster it will absorb into it. ...and, usually with increased porosity comes increased activation.. but, from here, you can gauge the quality of the char itself.

once its mixed with anything.. even compost.. ...well, 1) it's extremely difficult to know how much (char) is in there to begin with and 2) impossible to test how activated as well as how porous it is

C) you don't get to control *what* you're putting in there to begin with.  ... ...meaning, let's say that one soil type calls for x-amendment but another calls for more of y-amendment. and you're trying to grow a-crop in one and b-crop in another.. ...   this isn't 'the ideal' nor the 'best' way to do this, imo, and esp not the 'permaculture way'... ....but, on the one hand, sure, you can always just test the 'compost'char' you're adding and then add the other amendments accordingly... ...but.. ... if you can create your own compost pile, add a just-char product to it, then add the amendments you'd prefer that compost pile to be richer in... ...well.... ....you get the idea.

also, biochar already loaded then added to a compost pile will... .well, it'll already be 'loaded' and, as such, not as able to keep smells down, hold onto nutrients that may otherwise evaporate away (more easily) etc.

obviously making your own char is the cheapest way.. or tends to be... ...but, again, the problem with making it is that, without access to the higher quality more controlled instrumentation of 'advanced' biochar facilities, you just don't quite reach the quality of product, nor the specific 'accuracies' of higher-quality / higher-t-produced chars.  plus it may take a while and/or you may be limited by local burn laws.  

The ['Kon-Tiki'](https://www.reddit.com/r/BioChar/comments/3oixy5/kontiki_the_democratization_of_biochar_production/) is actually a nice little approach to it, and the size is similar to most backyard fire pits you can buy at walmart and the like.. ...so, all things considered, you can probably get away with it in a backyard situation, esp at night.   Assuming the biomass is properly aged, very little smoke will come up from it, and that's only in the initial phase until the pyrolysis process can get going, then essentially 'no' smoke comes from it.. ...then there's the last bit when putting it out.. ...which, again, is short as well usually just steam from the water flash-boiling.  smokers and charcoal grills produce *way* more smoke.. ...and fireplaces when they get started.    read: you can probably get away with it in all but the strictest of environments 

it produces good char.. of course, feedstock will come into play but, overall, you can get away with using it pretty often, it's actually nice, esp on a cool fall evening with some friends and some beer... or just chillaxing with a tablet or the starts or 'whatever'.. ...and, after the initial 'hit' on its price... ...and whatever price-paid for the biomass used (should be free if you're doing it 'right')... ...well.. ....but, even with it, the bought stuff will just be much much higher quality.

When I said I'd made the largest *quantity* in open burn... ...[this approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfcAA1hGDdA) is what I meant.  ...granted, i've done this many times on many different scales but.. ...the largest was... .....several dump trucks worth of material.  so, significantly larger than what he's using there.  On the largest we actually got the fire department to help out (they wanted to).  The first time I called them to 'check in', and the fire marshal was so interested in what I was doing that he asked me to call him when I was doing it and he came out to watch (we were using pressure washers then to control it).. ...He said, 'the next time you do this, you can do it even larger... and call us, I'd love to train my guys with it. It's much harder to 'control a burn' than to just put one out. It'll be great practice for them'. 

had some beers, some food (burgers, dogs, etc) and... they came out.  It was something on the level of 550 cu yds or material... in one go.  We produced enough biochar for.. ...well, we spread it over a 50 acre area/field... ..with intentions of going back and adding more in subsequent years.  Unfortunately my friend passed away whom I was doing it with and it was his/father's field so...   but, definitely fun.   And, the larger the pile (pyramid) the larger the pyrolysis zone inside.. and the faster the whole thing happens... ..and the hotter it gets *inside* the pyro-zone.

Oncor’s TDEC

Housed in the new Environment Sciences Laboratory building, the TDEC has two principle components: an immersion room and a demonstration center. Both contain impressive leading-edge media technology, with the immersion room offering multiple high-definition flat-screen displays that almost surround the viewer. Coupled with the video displays are fully integrated sound and lighting systems that provide an in-the-action feel to the room.

No stranger to severe weather, much of Oncor’s system is located in the southern end of the nation’s infamous tornado alley; and just so winter is not dull, north Texas often generates ice storms harsh enough to buckle the strongest overhead lines. To convey this impact, Oncor developed a short but intense multimedia presentation in the immersion room that allows the audience to experience (and feel) the evolution of a typical severe storm scenario, including lights out.

The presentation also details the impact of outages on customers and discusses the solutions electrical storage and microgrids might offer. A creative use of animated graphics and a dialogue mostly devoid of utility industry terms and acronyms allows nontechnical viewers to understand microgrid and storage operational concepts.

Not to be outdone, the demonstration center has a holographic display where an Oncor representative can appear in a device, reminiscent of a matter teleportation tube from a science fiction movie. In a prerecorded message, the representative explains the purpose of the TDEC, talks about what Oncor hopes to learn and discusses how knowledge will enable Oncor to serve its customers better in the future.

Along with housing the holographic display, the demonstration room serves as the control room for the microgrid. Several high-definition displays give the current operational status of the overall grid as well as the four sub-microgrids. Status also is readily available for all the major microgrid components. Reports show energy consumed, produced and saved all at a glance. Even while it is operational, the microgrid control system serves as a key show-and-tell element in the overall demonstration and education mission. It provides visitors with a real-time glimpse at how an advanced microgrid can tackle real-world energy problems and serves as a great example of a practical application of smart grid technologies.

Microgrid and TDEC Role

What is the role of this advanced facility going forward? Oncor still believes storage is a key element in the success of future utility grids and will be vital to provide the services customers will require and expect. Oncor also believes microgrids with integrated storage represent a singular opportunity to provide customers with energy solutions that can be tailored to meet their unique requirements. Oncor knows neither it nor anyone else has all the answers about the future, but believes its microgrid and TDEC provide the opportunity to explore that future and communicate what it finds to key stakeholders.

Oncor also will be using the microgrid and TDEC to test DER technologies. The utility will be examining how these technologies interact with the grid and how they might enable it to serve customers better. For example, Oncor wants to explore how advanced inverters might be used to feed volt-amperes-reactive into the grid, thereby offsetting some of the need for capacitor banks. Oncor will be developing test cases and use cases to determine how a portfolio of DER solutions might be combined to answer the problems grids will face in the future. It also wants to understand how the value of storage might be extracted fully for the benefit of the grid and the customer. There is much that needs to be explored, but Oncor feels the microgrid and TDEC will provide critical insights going forward.

As important as the SOSF installation is, the utility is not limiting phasing in of storage technologies to its microgrid and TDEC. It has begun testing 25-kWh storage devices strictly for reliability purposes. Installed at system locations with a history of reliability challenges, these devices help to keep the lights on for customers who are connected. Oncor believes the benefits resulting from reduced outages will prove such devices to be a cost-effective answer to reliability concerns.

A Back-to-the-Past Opportunity

Much has been written and said about the change the electric utility industry will experience over the next several decades. Anyone paying attention knows about the explosive growth of DERs and has heard about the threat of solar PV companies using storage to take utility customers off the grid.

In a way, this is a back-to-the-past kind of opportunity. The concept behind microgrids is not new. For example, data centers have long employed a form of microgrids to ensure extreme levels of electric service reliability. Today, it is the declining cost of solar PV, electric storage, and information and communications technologies that are opening so many more possibilities for microgrids.

Many have declared the grid has a terminal case of obsolescence. However, Oncor is not ready to retire the transmission and distribution grid just yet. In fact, the utility believes the grid will still offer great value to customers in the future, and it believes microgrids and electrical energy storage will play key and pivotal roles in delivering that future value.

Michael Quinnis vice president of strategy and CTO of Oncor Electric Delivery, charged with setting Oncor’s course in transforming the value of the electric grid through innovative, technology-driven and customer-focused solutions. His work impacts system performance and capital spending, legislative and regulatory efforts, customer engagement and future business model evolutions. Quinn joined Texas Utilities (Oncor’s predecessor) in 1988 and has had assignments in nuclear and fossil generation, system protection, asset management, transmission operations and business development. He holds a BSEE degree from Clemson University and is a registered professional engineer in the state of Texas. He is active on several trade associations and industry boards including energy storage, communications, transmission development and NERC compliance.

Hybrid Microgrids Front and Center

Is it a laboratory? Is it an educational facility? Is it a smart grid? Is it green? Will it improve reliability? Will it create customer value? Yes is the answer to all of these questions.

At first glance, Oncor Electric Delivery’s System Operating Support Facility (SOSF) may look like any number of electric utility service centers across the country. It is a 100-acre (40.5-hectare) site with buildings designed to service transformers, meters and other equipment. There is open space set aside for equipment inventories and storage. From a distance, there is little to indicate it is home to a state-of-the-art microgrid facility. As soon as one enters the site and drives closer to Oncor’s new Environment Sciences Laboratory building, the view changes rapidly.

Pulling into the Environment Sciences Laboratory parking lot, visitors might think they have driven to a National Renewable Energy Laboratory test facility by mistake. The central feature of the parking lot is a solar photovoltaic (PV) array that also provides shade for parked cars. Glancing around, one also sees a Tesla battery bank, and further investigation reveals a second smaller PV array, a microturbine and an electric vehicle charging station. Although it is not a National Renewable Energy Laboratory project, the facility does represent one of the next logical steps in Oncor’s strategic vision.

A Storage Strategy

What led Oncor to pursue such a seemingly futuristic project? Like many utilities, Oncor is well aware of the significant change that has occurred and is still ongoing in the utility industry. In fact, Oncor’s existence is a result of the first waves of that change. A regulated transmission and distribution utility, Oncor was the by-product of Texas’ deregulation efforts that separated vertically integrated investor-owned utilities into competitive and regulated utilities.

Although deregulation efforts have significantly slowed in most parts of the U.S., Oncor was aware of changes accelerating in other areas. Changing consumer attitudes and the growth of distributed generation were among these. In 2014, the utility released a series of new strategic initiatives that included the installation of battery backup systems, microgrid development and customer service improvements that covered reliability and outage restoration efforts among others.

Oncor felt electric storage was a key element in these initiatives, but it was concerned about its cost, and sought to identify and harvest all the benefits. The wide range of prices being reported for batteries also caused concern, so the utility decided to do its own research to determine the cost of batteries today and get a feel for what might be expected in the future.

The storage research culminated in a study by the Brattle Group, an independent market research firm, found “…deploying electricity storage on distribution systems across Texas could provide substantial net benefit to the state.” With the Brattle recommendations in hand, and believing storage was on the cusp of commercial viability, Oncor moved quickly to begin a conversation with market participants, stakeholders and elected officials. The Brattle report identified up to 5 GW of distributed energy storage could be cost-effectively implemented at $350 per kilowatt-hour if both the market-facing and reliability value of storage could be enhanced. The forecasted amount dwarfed California’s goal of 1.3 GW by 2020.

Oncor also believes it is important to locate storage close to the customer in order to extract maximum value from the technology. The Brattle report estimated 65% of the benefit of storage on the grid would come from merchant energy benefits. These services would include both real energy arbitrage and ancillary services. The report also estimated 35% of the benefit could come from enhanced reliability. Interestingly, Oncor believes enhanced reliability benefits, or value, could be justified even if the battery capacity is only used 10% of the time.

However, Oncor was well aware that market participants were only in the preliminary stages of understanding the economic and reliability benefits of grid-scale energy storage, so they set out to begin a conversation. What began only a few short years ago has worked its way into the national conversation as an active and integral component of a 21st century grid. Across Texas, and much of the nation, market participants, stakeholders, regulators, legislators and consumer groups are all actively talking about the benefits of battery storage.

To help educate stakeholders and better promote the conversation on storage, Oncor developed a physical facility where visitors could see and experience the new technologies firsthand. From this recognition was born the Technology Demonstration and Education Center (TDEC).

Oncor Electric Delivery, microgrids

TDEC-SOSF Integration

When exploring where the TDEC facility might be located, an opportunity presented itself. Oncor was planning on building the new Environment Sciences Laboratory at the Lancaster SOSF. In exploring this option, the utility discovered the SOSF presented other opportunities. Home to several mission-critical services, the SOSF periodically experienced outages that impacted operations. Also, as a wires-only utility, Oncor had to buy its power from the energy market just like its customers. These characteristics meant a microgrid might provide a real-world solution by enhancing reliability and reviewing the impact on the energy bill.

The decision was made to install the TDEC in the Environment Sciences Laboratory and integrate the microgrid into the SOSF power system. S&amp;C Electric Co. and Schneider Electric were selected as the vendor partners and construction began on the new facility in 2014. Nine months later, Oncor was in the microgrid business.

Microgrid Configuration

Although many of the elements of the Oncor microgrid are visible, not all aspects are obvious. The SOSF was previously served at multiple secondary voltage meter points. During construction, these were consolidated behind one primary voltage meter. Then the SOSF grid was subdivided into four separate microgrids that could be operated separately or in unison depending on the situation.

Nine different energy sources are connected to the SOSF microgrid. The larger devices include 560 kW of legacy diesel generation capacity, a 65-kW propane microturbine, a 106-kW solar array over the parking lot and a 45-kW gas-powered reciprocating generator. A smaller west-facing solar array also is connected to test the potential alignment of solar generation with peak system demand that occurs on summer afternoons. There is sufficient distributed generation available to allow the 1.5-MW system critical applications to operate completely isolated from the utility grid if necessary.

Other distributed energy resources (DERs) include energy storage and load management. Battery systems include a 200-kW/400-kWh Tesla battery and a 25-kWh S&amp;C PureWave Community Energy Storage product. The energy storage system plays the important role of providing the reference voltage and frequency when the microgrid is operating in isolation. Load management resources include heating, venting, air conditioning equipment and the electric vehicle charging station.

Schneider’s microgrid controller runs the Oncor microgrid, and S&amp;C provided distribution switches that can be used to reconfigure the grid automatically. This combined control system can detect and isolate faults, and operate as an independent grid. Additionally, the utility anticipates capabilities to dispatch DERs and optimize energy purchases.

There simply isn't enough shallow waters out there w/out doing it everywhere possible.'

my response was: 'why not out in the open water?'

their response: 'you have to anchor it on the seafloor'

my response: 'sink barges.  you're talking the top 25ft of water basically, I don't imagine the pull on the ropes is *that* strong.. ..sink barges to 25ft below the waterline, tie them into that.  and, in turn, tie the semi-buoyant barges (like how a submarine can go to a certain depth and just 'stay there')  to barges floating on the surface where 'land-based side' of operations are handled... maybe some greenhouses and such'

...the most recent (2 months ago), is the 57th most-recent post.

...the next? #189. Meaning, you had to go through one-hundred and eighty-nine posts to dig that one up.

...your first mentioned, but oldest post? #588!  I'll give it to ya, you scrolled for a while.

but, you also went through a *shit*load of posts to dig out... 3. and, at that, you point them out as if they are the average of what's to be found there. No mention of more reputable sources posted. More 'in-line' with common medical doctrine articles.

At that, also to a sub called *alt*cancer... ...that is *not* my posting to */r/cancer* .. so, I'm not shoving this down anyone's throat.  only the most dedicated will even stumble across it to begin with, and, at that, will recognize it as a sub with the word 'alt' in it.

At *that*, have you ever researched Dr Simoncini??  I really wouldn't be so quick to judge.  You really should take a bit to look into his approaches.  Even more impressive? the *thousands* of testimonies on the internet who utilized his methods .. ..where all other medicines had failed up to that point.. ..and who were still living long after 'more traditional approaches' had exhausted ... ...and, cancer free at that. (at least diagnosed anyway).  There's a video out there, I'll dig it up if I can, where a portion of a cancer conference's schedule was carved out for alternative approaches and, in such, dedicated to his approach. The room ... and a rather large room at that.. ..several hundred seated legally.. ...is overflowing with doctors and, even more so, *patients* who had incorporated his approaches who were still alive, parents, children, loved ones who were there to show their support for him.. ...because the other approaches had failed.  Not because their doctor's didn't have the best of intentions, but just because their methods hadn't worked.  You can be quick-to-dismiss, but I'm guessing you've never had cancer? Never lost anyone close to cancer? 

..and, at that, you've been a redditor for 4 years. You have *one* link karma. Everything else is comment karma...quite the ratio there.  Quick to criticize what others are posting to a sub that, most likely, before yesterday you didn't even know existed..  ..read: a sub filled with postings *not* being shoved in front of your face presenting 'false hope rubbish'. Pretty hypocritical if you ask me. You didn't, granted, but, then, like you, I just felt like rattling my fingers off and seeing myself type a bit thinking someone else gives two shits about my opinion vs.. ..getting back to posting some more of those 'hundreds of links' that you failed to mention while you were skipping over 'hundreds' to find the three more extreme you focused on.

..but, not to end it on a shit tone &amp; not-helpful comment like you chose to, an MD who also has hundreds+ of successful cancer treatments utilizing non-traditional approaches is Dr Brownstein, MD.  Here's a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyPuP9GMdIw) (2m42s) that you may find interesting. He has several more out there if interested.

532,"I really like the idea of it, and clearly it works..   ..Israel's been doing it for a while.  ...and, well, just the utilization of wastewater in general.

I think the issue is less 'is using wastewater bad' and more, 'what standards should we use / how far should we take purifying it before reusing it'?

As the studies (and one of the 'my sides right!') showed.. it's basically in trace quantities.

The question also is, is it in the water? the soil? or the food too?   as well, do the harvests have higher concentrations vs the water? soil? plant?

gotta admit, I didn't read the studies, just the transcript.

That said, 'water is water', for the most part.. ..from an H2O perspective, and 'infinitely recyclable'.   

Maybe better to 'tier' the wastewater use by crop-type.  Studies to narrow down which plants do a better job filtering water filtered at x, y, and z levels of purity..   and, well, worse case scenario, use wastewater (and humanure?) to water &amp; fertilize non-food based crops.

Algae for food is one thing, [algae](/r/algae) for fuel much different.  Same with [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass).   ... or building materials (lumber farms).  The soil building of switchgrass, and the fact that it's a perennial seems like it'd really cater to helping hold onto these, filter them out, break them down, and otherwise reduce the level of fucks needed to be given.

... and, being a perennial, also seems like it could work really well with mycorrhizal fungi that shows an affinity for breaking things down.. ..like you suggested (great idea, btw!).

...then there's always the idea of throwing [biochar](/r/biochar) into the mix as well... 

or if a facility/farm could bring the water into a manufactured wetland area of sort, over water it, let it drain down through the fast-growth filter-crops, collect at the bottom... and then utilize that to water the crops with.  sort of a 1-acre fast-growth compost/energy crop per '100 acres' or something.  ... but, that again brings it back to level of purity needed per crop-type.

otherwise? waste water isn't 'waste', it's just water that gets to get reused again",2016-04-28 23:49:33+00:00,d2le3iq,4.0,t1_d2ldlwl,777.0,Agriculture

getting it fixed enough to fill it with foam from this point? no clue if it could even be done, but.. ...point stands, if it had already *been* foam-filled, unless there was some *super* compelling reason for me to *not* keep driving it around (and probably try to refill it... by covering that plug with a shitload of something-glue/epoxy/etc... ..and hammering it back in there.. ...I'd have zero qualms with driving it around until it *gave* me reason to replace it.. ..by turning it into insurance and letting someone else deal with it.

Tires aren't just expensive, same with insurance claims, but it's also a pain in the ass process that requires taking the machine in for service... ..which is never cheap.

I mean, using the ocean water *as* the coolant.... allows for the separation between salt &amp; freshwater.. ..and, then it'd be the freshwater that'd be super-cooled and spread over the already-existing ice.

The water required by the plant for cooling is a different scenario.. ..but, in effect, it, too, would be as closed-loop and/or efficient as possibly.  The 'steam' ... well, *any* steam released is inefficiencies in plant design. If it's still hotter than the ambient in such as to *be* steam, then it still has an energy value to it and, thus, can still be used to heat the salt water in such as to begin to separate out the fresh from it.. ...which, again, would be captured then pushed through the cooling system that the reactor would essentially be built to power damn-near 100%.  Like, that would *be* it's purpose.. ...to super-cool water with the intention of spreading-over and thickening the ice sheets.

to address the sodium build-up... ...well, it would need to be designed with anti-corrosive parts, materials, and/or coatings to help it withstand and endure its intended design.  This is by no means a 'great idea'.. ..but was just what popped in my head while reading the article.  It isn't so much a transference of freshwater from watersheds as it is the 'extraction' of freshwater from already-existing water supplies.. read: the ocean.   what to do with the excess brine?  not exactly sure.  dilute it over a wider area? I mean, I suppose it could be seen as 'product'.. ..sea salt seems to be in ever-increasing demand.  What do they do with brine from desal plants? (rhetorical question, I know the answer... no offense intended) pump it into holding pools created and let it slowly dilute?   use some steam created from the plant to create underground pockets and pump it into? transport it to abandoned n.gas and/or petro wells? ... or, again, just dilute it out to sea.

But, back to the water it discharges back into the environment.. ...again, any heat is energy-yet-extracted.  temperature balancing... heat exchangers.. ..recondense the 'steam' by extracting the energy from it by heating up the incoming water to, again, begin to pre-separate out the salt &amp; freshwater.  ... once the energy is extracted from the 'exhaust', it will naturally recondense and, in turn, be able to be recycled back into the plant itself.    It is a non-issue for the larger project and, again, can be used to feed into the project's end goal: producing super-cold water to thicken the ice sheets.

Vs, say, creating more of a closed-loop environment like that provided with greenhouses where water, c-emissions, fertilizers, etc can be collected at the 'ends' of the systems and fed back into the top of the next one.

No doubt it's a b.s. set of pieces.. ..and a b.s. move to attack the industry.. ..and, at that, published by some fairly large media outlets at that. 

Possibly better to address the issues being brought up via the pieces rather than attacking those raising awareness that this wave is in force. Be it attacking the information in the articles, attacking those publishing the articles themselves, those behind the information in them (Greenpeace in this case) or.. those key individuals motivating *that* as *well*.

Posting them in this sub is *not* 'promoting their ideas'.. ..even if it *is* carrying them forth.  ...but, my thinking/feeling/sentiments-on it are that most-anyone who follows this sub, let alone subscribes *is* 'pro-nuclear'... ..and, as such, would be better informed, and early enough, the attacks and the arguments backing them up.. ..as such to head them off before picks up enough force to start trickling down into more-b.s. froth sources that enter the less-educated, less-well-informed public's eye via more easily digestible 'pop' news sources that the 'average person' is more apt to get their info from.",2016-03-10 21:15:24+00:00,d0v77ex,2.0,t1_d0uji0x,41466.0,nuclear

There's a difference between posting something and agreeing with what's posted.

707,"&gt; but I'd love to hear your opinion. You seem more informed than most people, based on what you post.

that's a *loooong* rant, man. Half the reason I never chime in. I more follow the industry and make business decisions accordingly vs discuss it... ...esp on reddit.  There are way too many variables, way too many takes on it, and way too many.. ...things in play per it.  From the grid to energy storage to energy production.

Let me put it this way, and maybe this one'll give you an idea of where I'm coming from with that: Like I said a couple of weeks ago (and only half-drunkenly posted it, and have since deleted it because I don't generally comment about such things on reddit.. ..so i can't direct link *to* the post as evidence).. ...I recently (2-3 weeks ago) just covered my shorts on Tesla Motors.

I'm a definite believer in 'the cause' per Tesla, as well, as a long term play... ..but, was just too easy to short and make a pop off of.  I clearly could've shorted it a bit longer and made a bit more off of it, but.. .. my repressed alcoholism was telling me I needed a nice of celebrations (hence the inebriated post) .. ..and, I couldn't in good conscience (and of sound business mind) keep an open short against Tesla in play while potentially going on a bender.. ..having the money from covering the short also came in handy ;)

but, it's a HUGE subject, lots of money in the industry, lots of politics, and lots of 'fluctuation' all around relative to it.

It's a conversation easily rambled about over a few drinks and possibly some links pulled of the various subs I post to to reinforce the arguments... ...but, to type it all out here?  would take too long as well, could way too easily be proven wrong given the volatility of it.

Long term? I'm optimistic. I think a multi-pronged approach will continue to (as it has-*been*) be the path forward.

Terrorism and terrorist threats aside.. ..decentralized redundancy is the way forward.. ..but, have no doubts, this is very much so a *for-profit* **industry**.  Capitalism reigns, socialism safety nets it. ... but profits are the goal either way.

edit: oh, and, thanks.  but, maybe more informed than most, but.. ..you can't be informed-enough in this industry.. ..and, you can also be *over*-informed, just depending on how you want to look at it. Too much information sometimes clouds the mind. ",2016-03-03 05:14:09+00:00,d0lp7ra,2.0,t1_d0l88xl,27465.0,TheGrid

[It may be?](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/14/world/ice-age-postponed/) (shit, didn't mean to send that)

.. but maybe even a better thing given current activities to capture as much of it in the ground as possible (and below it.. refilling aquifers) ... and biochar is an excellent material for doing that.  ...as well, if we harness its energy and use it to replace energy from fossil fuels, we can stop creating more water and putting it into the atmosphere to begin with (or capture it out the exhaust before that happens?)

&gt; Man-it's a complicated system

you're tellin' me!

&gt; It's a wonder it's lasted so long. 

It'll last a helluva lot longer w/ or w/out us.. ..but it'll last a helluva lot longer within more preferred levels if we make more biochar.. ..via one method. ..or another :)",2016-02-25 22:05:39+00:00,d0dt9qm,15.0,t1_d0dosip,5675.0,BioChar
763,"[This one](https://www.skepticalscience.com/water-vapor-greenhouse-gas.htm) popped up at the top of a google search. 

you know what else contributes to rain? 'newly created' water.. ...like that formed in engines burning fossil fuels. HC burns, combines with atmospheric Oxygen, HC's become CO's (or CO2's) and H2O's and are emitted as water vapor out the tailpipe.

We're *making* water from fossilized hydrocarbons.. ..during a hot process, as well, pumping fossilized water up from non-renewable aquifers, as well, pumping out renewable aquifers at a faster rate than they can renew... 

it's a triple wammy: Carbon emissions (that otherwise wouldn't be there), newly created water emissions, that otherwise wouldn't be there.. or even be water to begin with, and fossilized water to make up the difference... ..all while destroying the soil that would help retain it.

Biochar creation releases C, but, it does so with what is at worst a carbon neutral way (unless we're using fossil fuels to fuel the pyrolysis process). Sure the heating process is being implemented by us, and is otherwise accelerating the release of that carbon back into the atmosphere, but of the percentage that does, a lot more of it is staying behind *as* biochar (ie, the more you water it, the sooner you cap it off, the less it burns down to gaseous C and the more remains behind *for* the intended goal.. ..

...thus, the less C in the atmosphere. Once added to the soil, the more SOM increases, the more CO2 is pulled down, the more water is retained, the less is needed *to* water the crops.. ...and, if done in a capacity or system whereby the energy can be harnessed for 'other means' (that replace the need for energy via other means) the more the system builds on itself.  ...and, the less water moisture in the atmosphere *to* contribute to the greenhouse effect to begin with.

In short: biochar is apart of a longer-term carbon negative process that has the added benefit of reducing the quantity of atmospheric water vapor and, if done in an efficient manner, an energy source. Thus: biochar production *can be* a carbon negative energy source that farther reduces 'other' ghg's.

765,"&gt; Oh, I don't have a problem with using water-I agree with your rainwater bit.

just thought you may be alluding to the whole 'water vapor is a worse ghg than C emissions' thing.

Easier just to shovel it in a (metal) container filled with water... just using the hose to control the burn in the process.

&gt; But you're probably right, It wouldn't completely burn everything. I imagine I'd mix it with a compost and the unburnt portions would feed the compost.

the burned portions will too.. ...most of the minerals are too heavy to evaporate at those temperature..  so, they'll be there for the microbes as well.

&gt; It's fun to think about-I'd like to have a piece of land one day and experiment a little.

much better idea, I've had the fire department called on me more than once when trying it in my backyard (faulty designs).  :)

(yes), as there's a theory that letting it rot is worse than doing it this way :)   

if it rots, you end up with the rest of the Amazon. If you do it (this way or some other) you get the terra preta areas of the Amazon. Which would you prefer growing something in?

&gt; I wonder.. ..you'd cap it

why wouldn't it? I've ended a burn prematurely multiple times only to cap it off and come back the next day and have the material that was still very clearly visibly wood when I pre-ended it be char.

what's the problem with using the hose? a $20 pump, some solar panels, and some $50 250-gal cubes off craigslist can hold enough rainwater to handle controlling something the scale of what he's doing in the video.  What's the issue with just dousing it until it's out?   Biochar is made naturally all the time.

That said, at worst, I see it as being relatively 'neutral' to begin with. The NxOx's will break down, the CO will up-complete to CO2, and the various 'others' released will settle back down soon enough after cooling down.

I don't see it as 'ideal', but I don't really see it as a 'problem' per se either.  Ultimately, if composted or even if simply left to rot, they'd break down and be back in the carbon cycle one way or another and 'soon enough' (faster near the equator, slower near the poles) that... ...it's 'neutral' but temporarily-problematic (via CO, NxOx's, etc) at 'worst' and ultimately better than composting it because at least the intention is a 'controlled burn' in such as to produce biochar... and, preferably, in larger quantities than may otherwise be naturally created via, say, a prairie grass or forest fire.

France has about 300 warheads, China has around 250 and the United Kingdom has about 215. Israel is widely acknowledged to possess a sophisticated array of nuclear weapons. Estimates of the Israeli nuclear arsenal vary widely, from as little as 80 to as many as 400, with at least 100 of those weapons being thermonuclear ""hydrogen bombs.""

It's dangerous, it takes too much to mess with, cool, process, isn't an 'easy' thing, etc.  HC chains make so much more sense as a storage medium.  The problem with HC chains is the environmental toll extracting them, the environmental impact of utilizing them, and the politics involved around them.

but, from an energy density perspective, they're essentially the second greatest thing to nuclear.

That said... ...my main/ultimate conclusion? even if going for H2 ICEs, it still begins a hydrogen infrastructure. (which we already have via n.gas, petroleum, etc) .. and, with that, the increased likelihood that we'll start using H2-fueled fuel cells.

The point of that? once you're using fuel cells, you're using electric vehicles.. ..powered by the electricity from the fuel cell.  From here? if all designed peachy-nice? You could swap in batteries, fuel cells, hybrid combinations of the two, etc.  ...and, *that's* my main conclusion with h2: it allows for a transition from ICEs to EMs.

But, like you pointed out, a refillable butane lighter.  a &lt;2oz bottle of compressed H2 sold at the airport gift shop.  Your laptop, tablet, 'whatever' dying on the plane? give it a squirt from the compressed little &lt;2oz airport bought canister and.. ... viola, you're back up and running with enough power to keep the device going at full use for another 'week or so'.

The moisture created? It gets compressed into a separate storage compartment and recondensed into water.  You can either 'dump it out' (like, literally open up the compartment, pull out the little container, and... ....pour it down the drain or drink it even... ...

or, you can use it as a feedstock for your electrolysis system that will convert it back to compressed H2 for use during your next fill-up.. ..which is the usual way you get your power because who wants to go to a gas station, grocery store, or airport mag rack and buy compressed H2 every time they want to fill up their portable device?

but, at the same time? like a battery, like a fuel cell design... ...like in a car.. ...make the compartment or design 'swappable' .. ..hot-swappable even if the device is otherwise plugged into the wall.. ...and swap out the fuel cell with a standard lithium battery.. or, better? a less-energy-dense supercapacitor.. ...but, one that can fill up 'instantly' ... ..via, say, a portable fuel cell device like a portable 10,000mAh battery pack today.

But, being a super capacitor, like graphene, for example, you can have it simply 'touch' the energy source and essentially all the power it's going to store can be transferred to it in 'seconds' vs minutes to hours with traditional batteries today.

I suppose my point is, modular designs.  Swappable modular designs.. ...fuel cells, batteries, and super capacitors.  Let the consumer choose which is best suited for their current set up.

I see a place for fuel cells.. ...powered by H2... which, in turn, can be created from fossil fuels or electrolysis of water .. .. and, well, just like the Prius wasn't the answer to pure-petro-powered cars, H2 won't be the answer to them either.. ...but, it'll make a few fun products along the way.

but, if nothing else? H2-filled portable fuel cell battery packs.  even if not built into the devices, at least the option to plug into them.. ...which, a fuel cell range extender for my otherwise battery/capacitor-powered Tesla? great! 

it'd be no different than hooking a diesel or gasoline generator up to the trailer hitch of a tesla and running a line from the generator to the tesla..  ..with onboard computer controls designed to work specifically with this.. ..that would otherwise power the tesla as well charge it up.  Run low on fuel? Pull over to your local gas station and.. ..fill 'er back up.

Kerosene. ..hell, even diesel. Most gas stations don't even have diesel... kerosene is very few and far between.  I've had to drive past multiple gas stations before to get to one that has kerosene for my reddy heater.  ...why would H2 tanks be any different?

a few random gas stations all tied into an easily searchable database map app deal for google maps on your phone.. ..H2-friendly gas station coming up in 10 miles.. ..pull over, fill up with H2.   it doesn't have to be widespread deployment.  

but, it can also be as convenient as something similar to a Honda PHIL station in your house that takes n.gas, converts it to H2, fills up a tank, and you can fill up with it at home.  plug in an air compressor hose vs a battery line when you get home? what's the difference?

I think a modular system... or, hell, maybe scales.. ...same interface, more modularity...

so, want simple? buy an ipod touch or ipad of storage solutions.  ..or, maybe a better analogy would be, an 'imac' of storage solutions.  a simple, all in one design with a few, limited, upgrade ports if you decide to add more power, but, in a limited way..

sell a few variations of this... to scale.. ...'sizes' if you will.  

then, a larger, more adaptable system... ... like a G3/G4 tower (likening it back to 15+ years ago with the imac deal hit hit) ... ...where, this design'll cost you, but it has the ability to be upgraded or matched with more specific system.

...but, they all plug in around a standardized OS X or iOS interface-type, so moving from one to the other is the same format and deal.. ...just, more settings the more complex it gets.  but, otherwise, essentially plug &amp; play simple.  ...if I can plug in a 120v or 240v plug into the wall for a standard appliance or dryer... ...and, even change the dryer cable from a 3 pin to a 4 pin or vice versus... ... why not do the same with these systems?  I know there's a bit more to it than that, but the concept sits.

Interface, easy interactivity ... ...buy a chromecast or Apple tv or anything along those lines... hell, a laptop or desktop or tablet.. ...you have to set it up to tie into the house's wifi to get it working correctly... and, from there, 'like' a western digital mycloud deal.. ...you can access it from anywhere in the world that you can get internet access... all via a wide variety of different device-types.. ..with notifications and such all coming into play. the ability to change settings, etc.  

make the system compatible such that it can tie into the grid.. ...based upon demand and/or pricing (prices are fixed where I live, but in California and such, they fluctuate so..) ... if power's going to be $0.15/kwh for the next few hours? switch to the batteries... ...recharge them when it drops down to $0.08kwh during the night..

the system would, of course, need to cycle the batteries in a controlled and monitored way.. and, well, be sexy as hell.. so it isn't just something hidden in the back, but almost something you *want* to show off.  you *want* your neighbors to see it when you pull into your garage at night, etc... ...ie, 'ego' so 'high-dollar clients' who engage in pissing contests like that


the modularity of it is... ...well, like usb or thunderbolt or 'firewire' before it.. ..daisy chain'able.. ...need more power? just plug in another device to the next... need more voltage, well, there's another 'usb port' for parallelism, otherwise, serialism for longer-life.

the packages? like external cases... empty ones.. ...that you can put 'whatever' battery inside of.  from there, 18650 cells... ...in a purchase agreement.  the cases for them monitor the cells.. and, again, netflix-style you new batteries when the old ones go bad.  in the interim, they condition the cells, charge them independently, automatic 'maintenance software' (like antivirus / antispyware stuff) runs in the background... conditions them... ..controls which are charged and which are discharged to keep it all even.. .. knows which are plugged directly in and which are on a daisy-chain line.. ...which are older, which are newer, and... make the whole thing 'barcode' or 'serial number simple'.   if i can use a barcode app with my phone's camera, i can use it (or just manually type in the serial number of the battery) ... during initial setup or programming to show which cell is in which compartment.. ...scan and place, next.   that way each is individually identified and controlled accordingly.. ...hell, a nice little control chip inside each one would increase costs, but be recyclable if the package is designed properly in such that *when* the cell is netflix-sent back to the factory *for* recycling, it 'pops off' and is reset... the cell is recycled accordingly.

some are lithium ion, others are lead acid, others are... ...fuel cells with an x-gallon storage tank... ... the entire thing... ...interface.  it has to look sexy and *be* 'sexy' to interact with.

set it up with a service... 1 yr warranty at time of purchase with upgrades.. ...want the 'service warranty as well'?

934,"completely off topic, but you should throw some of your pulp into a blender then pour your juice into the blender with it and blend them after juicing... ...if it gets too thick, dilute with kombucha .. the microbes in the kombucha'll love the super-available freed-from-their-fiber-prisons sugars and nutrients and go coocoo for coco puffs for them.. ..as will the natural organisms already in the produce.. ....you get [fiber](https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/4117xl/microbiome_fibre_for_the_future/) as well as [binders](https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/40u90b/lowfiber_diets_kill_off_some_species_of_gut/) for toxins.. ...as well more nutrients.   I call it 'ju'blend'  (with a thick Pepe Le Pew french accent) 

vegetative fiber or dietary fiber is different than b.s. fiber in metamucil capsules.. ...the nutrients are bound to the fiber.. ..and, even though the juicing process largely separates these, they're still there.   the body pulls the nutrients it needs off of the fiber they're attached to, they're charged, and, as such, an inverse-charge remains on the fiber-part.. .. the body uses the charge of the nutrients, bumps out toxins that may've been bound-to and... ...that 'bumped out toxin' contains a very similar charge and, in turn, binds to the fiber from which the *needed* nutrient/mineral was separated.. ...and now the fiber becomes a binder for toxins and gets rid of it.

to *just* juice is to miss this value.   so, think of vegetative fiber as increasing the cation exchange capacity similar to biochar in the soil.  ..and the paramagnetic bond of the fiber&gt;to&gt;the&gt;toxins being akin to the paramagnetic bond of biochar to toxins in the soil.. ...if the plant/body needs them? they're much stronger and will 'easily' overcome this bond.. ...otherwise, in the case of fiber, the system will simply flush it out.. ...in the case of biochar, it'll simply hold onto it and keep it away from what's *wanted* active in the soil.

consuming activated carbon (and biochar) also binds-to toxins and such... ...but, unlike biochar in the soil that 'stays'... and gives *plenty* of time to the biota (seemingly 'thousands of years') ... a.c. consumed passes through the body and, well, can tie up nutrients.. ...removing them from the body.   great if that's what's wanted, meaning, great if you just swallowed a bunch of poison accidentally and need to get it out of you.. ...they give a.c. to overdose patients, for example... ...and, arguably great if the a.c./biochar is already loaded with nutrients (like feed-grade azomite pre-mixed before being fed to livestock, for example) ... ...and probiotics before being fed to the livestock.. ...in such that it helps to provide nutrients and beneficial organisms to the animal (or human?... which is technically an animal, and many a pink floyd posters imply that we, too, are livestock for 'the system') ... ..um... ..and, worst case scenario, if it *doesn't* get utilized (some inevitably will)... ..it'll mix with their poo, potentially lower methane emissions, put in microbes that will help compost the poo faster, as well, blend biochar and nutrients directly into the poo in such that once its composted... ...it's bang-on-loaded with nutrients, microbes, and organic carbon in such that it's basically badass when mixed into the soil.


kinda deviates from the ju'blend suggestion though.. ..but, you should check it out.  control the pulp you add while doing it.. ...like, i always do beets first.. ...and i always add 100% of my beet pulp to the blender.. ...other pulp doesn't matter as much.. ...so, for viscosity's sake... ...you can always add more if it's still 'liquidic enough to drink'.. ...and, you can always dilute if you get it too thick to drink with... ...water, coconut water :) , other juices, or... ...my personal favorite, kombucha.  let it sit for 5-10 while you clean up, have the produce closer to room temp i before juicing.. ...and the microbes already in the produce, as well, in the kombucha will go bookoo crazy... ...producing all sorts of enzymes and breeding out like crazy.

remember, we live ~80 years.  but, many microbes live just a few hours... 3, 6, 12, etc.   so, to zoom out to a 24hr time scale... if 24hrs is to them what 80 years is to us, the 5 minutes to them is well, i don't feel like doing the math, but months to *years* to them.. ...they can produce 'billions' or even 'trillions' of beneficial enzymes during that time, and a few generations.. ...and, more if their lifespan is shorter.. ...and, organisms in abundant environments (which juice certainly is) tend to breed like crazy...  ...even more if the temperature's right (ie, room temperature produce vs fresh from the fridge)

.. to add a bit to that.. ...if you're into kombucha, and if you grew your scoby out from a store-bought kombucha (or you got froma  friend who got from a friend who got from their mother's uncle's daughter's cousin-in-law twice removed and upside down).. ...it largely only contained the strains in that single kombucha.. ...ie, the strains that that manufacturer used to grow *their* scoby.. ...

to do it 'right', you need a mix... ...ie, go around your city, get at least 1 kombucha from each manufacturer... ..a good diversity of organisms (High Country Kombucha is the only one I've found that actually uses *the* kombucha strain from which the whole thing gets its name... zygosaccharomyces kombuchianesis ) ... ...use a cup of each in the starter mix ... ...a cup of Braggs apple cider vinegar too, just to get those strains in there... ..and, there're a few probiotics to use... ...my two of choice are Jarrow Formula's Saccharomyces Boulardii (best if bought at whole foods 'cause they refrigerate it... vitamin shoppe, most health food stores, and amazon don't.. fwtw).. ...and, Garden of Life RAW Probiotic men/women wiser (30+ strains vs most pro-b's only having like 10,... vitamin shoppe sells the best/cheapest)

all that said... 1 of each pro-b, 1 cup of each kombucha (I used like 14-15 different kombuchas, where I'm from has quite the selection... granted, it took me 5 stores to get them all... whole foods-included) ... ...and 1 cup of Bragg's.. ...i believe i threw some kefir water in there too just for kicks.. ...the whole thing cost &lt;$100 and, i've never had to do it again.. ...but, point being, you get strains in it you'd never have otherwise.. ...and, 'infused' within the SCOBY during its initial-creation, vs adding them in to an already-established SCOBY you grew or got from someone else.

the point being, a diversity of strains you simply won't get otherwise.. ...and, then, the ... well, like the [third paragraph of this article states](http://www.rdmag.com/news/2016/01/low-fiber-diets-spell-trouble-human-gut-microbiota?et_cid=5054957&amp;et_rid=623702531&amp;type=headline) ... at least 5600 different species..   ....at best, this super-scoby would have 50 different strains.. ...with is 1/112th the number in the gut.. ...and, those are gotten from the foods we eat... juices we drink, etc.. ...so, the vast diversity will come from foods (most from raw foods.. cooking kills organisms... ...not all, but most).. ... so, the 'wild strains' in the produce.. ...will go crazy for all the sugars &amp; nutrients too.. ...and, the pro-b's and kombucha strains will help 'structure' them.. ...kinda like how biochar helps to structure the soil... ...

from there, well... blenders are way easier to clean out than a juicer so this step adds no time and no real headache on the already pain-in-the-ass cleanup process that's to come with the damn juicer and overall mess of the process... (just blending won't extract the nutrients the same way as juicing does.. ...but you *will* get the fiber.. ...but you'll also get a very thick juice depending on ingredients-used.. ...but it's stating the obvious to say that fruits have more 'juice' in them than (most) veggies.. so, thick blend w/out something to dilute it)

um.. ...excess daughter SCOBYs you don't feel like eating?  grab a 55 gallon open-top food grade barrel off craigsllist and pour a batch of kombucha + throw the daughter in there.. ...with rainwater.. ...and any foods you *don't* consume... ..and seal off (EM formula bokashi-style comes into play here) .. ..with that, you'll have a giant bokashi composter that you can then throw over your standard compost pile once its finished and.. ..you'll infuse those microbes into your compost... ..so, in your garden, they'll potentially  come back around and be a part of the foods you grow... ...will help colonize the biochar like crazy.. ..esp if you follow Josiah Hunt's [blend of choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UiW3-IMfME) (&lt;--should direct link to 20m47s) and the char's sugar (flour, molasses, 'whatever') and mineral loaded

/r/diatomaceousearth (i'm a mod :) )

&gt; What I was going for was that if an animal is in better conditions it will not develop worms.

animals don't 'develop worms', it isn't a 'condition', it's an infection.  they have to be exposed first *to* develop a worm infection.. ...i totally get what you're saying, just being semantic.  but, ...

&gt; they get worms from eating their own shit

they get worms because they're exposed to them.. ...their shit has worms in it because they were exposed to worms to *have* them in their shit..

pigs eat '[waste](/r/waste)' .. .as such, worms are a greater likelihood, (as they've had greater time to hatch and/or grow... ..and, as such, be harder to pass and/or more likely to be a lasting infection)... ...  but, avoiding worms is all but impossible, hence the d.e. idea.   but, even it is limited in its effectiveness.  a great 'frontline defense' but nothing compares to a proper environment and proper environment... (we're ultimately in agreement, i'm just being semantic).. ..and, even then, a 'proper environment' is next to impossible... ...even a $20 cut of pork from Whole Foods will have worms in it, or at least worm eggs... ...as will a $10 piece of sushi.. or $20 cut of wild sea bass.. ...the worms are essentially unavoidable.. ... a strong immune system only goes so far.. ..these things exist on the fossil record for &gt;500m years,  they are *extremely* evolved and capable... ...that said, ultimately, at the end of the day, avoiding them is smart but essentially impossible... ...dewormers come into play almost inevitably..

..and, even then, like you said, defenses are created.. ..within limits.. ...but, that chemo is being used vs them? I think is a strong sign that either the chemo-industry is looking for new markets, or they are, as you pointed out, quite adept..  ..but, even though d.e. is difficultly evolved against, it's still no silver bullet..

...and nor are the drugs... and chemo only works because it's poison.. ..that leaves simply.not.getting.them. as the best route to go.. ...and the best way to do that is to drastically cut down on how you would... ...ie, don't eat pork...

...and, where possible, load your soil up with biochar loaded with fungi-eating-worms and... ...borax.  won't kill worms entirely, but will fuck up the eggs, the little ones, and will drive the larger ones away... ..as well, give the soil [boron](/r/altboron)... ..which we could all use a little more of.

It isn't that they're so hard to kill (when properly respected/treated), it's that they aren't properly acknowledged as *being* a problem.

I really need to dig up this article from like Sept 2014... ...it'd explain where I'm coming from.  but, in short? worms cause a lot more problems than they're credited with... ...and, largely because the medical industry treats them as a 'third world problem'... when, in truth, 85% of the population, when properly tested, tests positive for at least one type of worm.  and 50% of those that test positive for one? test positive for more than one worm-type.

Totally under-respected infectious parasite.

942,"&gt; I know there are millions of landfills producing unused (a.d.) ""landfill gas"" (basically the same composition of gases). 

I doubt it's 'millions' ...but, I'd call that an 'industry' and an 'infrastructure'.  The number *is* quite high.

...and, it certainly isn't 'free'.. one way or another.  It's actually pretty decently expensive from what I read.  Certainly more than 'pocket change'.   ...but, certainly *less* than pyrolysis units. ... esp on that scale.  And, it doesn't remove the ability to do follow-up pyrolysis on the landfills or feedstock when the time, investment, desire, and need to arises.

My understanding is that most landfills that produce a.d. also invest in gensets designed to utilize the gas with minimal cleanup. The new GE gensets that started hitting the scene circa-2012 are capable of it. It'd take a bit to dig up the articles but I've posted them many times across various subs. .../r/naturalgas may be the easiest place to find them if you're curious.

At that, you're really making your case to someone who has spent dozens to hundreds of hours making the same case... here... on reddit. /r/biochar, /r/gasification /r/syngas /r/pyrolysis /r/switchgrass /r/biomass /r/... ... the list is long. I've literally posted *hundreds* of articles over the past half-decade+ on the subject. It's largely because of this that I'm too lazy to dig up the articles to readjust the way you're looking at it... and, you're coming at it so strongly from your perspective (arguing with the choir basically) that it's, quite frankly, easier to just let you hold your ground and *not* engage.. ...though, I feel that'd be 'rude'.. but, just to give you a heads-up as to where I'm coming from with it.

but, this line... 

&gt; By the way, syngas to Methanol is not a difficult process. It looks quite easy.

makes me think that your arguments are more academically-based than experienced-in-the-industry -based so.. ...

But, ultimately, I'm all with ya.. pyrolytic gasification *is* the way to go.. ...but, it isn't cheap, the industry isn't really geared for it, it isn't as cost-competitive as you're making it out to be.. and, well, it *is* used..  it just isn't talked about as much because, quite simply, most people don't care enough.  ..and, i can't entirely blame them it isn't the *most* entertaining subject to talk about.

&gt; The hard part seems to be making biofuels compatible with the petroleum infrastructure.

so don't. make them compatible with a genset that you find that's compatible with what's being produced... then have the genset make the electricity it produces compatible with the grid it ties into.. or, the equipment-type utilizing it. 

meaning, if you have a bunch of trucks (say, WM having garbage trucks) or are near customer-types that have trucks or fleet vehicles.. ...say, UPS by the Louisville airport near the WM plant ... by the Louisville airport.. ...then make a deal.  Have UPS or WM get delivery or garbage trucks.. ..or broker a deal with the city to get school buses and city buses to get equipment utilizing it...   ...and, viola, utilization of transport vehicles using gas produced.   ... or, electric vehicles that can be charged off the grid from juice pumped into it via the syngas utilized by the gensets.

my point is, it doesn't have to be compatible with the [petroleum](/r/petroleum) industry.. it just needs to be compatible with *any* industry that can justify the costs of the infrastructural investments.  It isn't a 'technological-issue' but a financial/economic one..   ...and, again, not the sexiest pitch to the board or a bank.  Economic sense? absolutely. ... albeit, maybe not in the current &lt;$30 market.. ...thus, politics.   but, don't worry, we'll be at war again soon enough and oil will jack up &gt;$100/barrel again and projects of this type will make sense (again).

I've posted 'lots of articles' over at /r/livestock and /r/algae about using insects and algae ([chlorella](/r/chlorella) &amp; [spirulina](/r/spirulina) mainly) to livestock.  Not only do they seem to not mind, but they also seem to prefer it.. ...kinda like eating all the marshmallows in a bowl of Lucky Charms.   but, in this case, the 'marshmallows' (ie, insects or algae) are beneficial.. ..vs being pure sugar.

It isn't a '100% feed' .. ...like, you wouldn't feed them *just* insects or *just* algae.. nor even a combo of both.. ...but, they can make up a pretty large portion of their diet.   and the insects and algae can be grown utilizing their waste, so that's a plus as well.   not '100%' but, lots of nutrients in waste and a health portion of it can be made up of it.

The algae can also serve a dual purpose.. ...you can extract the energy from it first (Algenol's algae produces ~9,000 gallons of ethanol per acre per year + ~1'500 gallons of mixed H-C chains... ranging from the shorter CH4 (methane) all the way up to diesel (C18H38) and beyond even... bioplastic-length and formations)

cross this vs corn that's possibly 150 gallons per acre per year and you can clearly see corn doesn't compare (well, except for the political support, subsidies, tax breaks, and grants anyway).

The remaining pulp post energy extraction can be used as the feedstock for livestock.   like corn.  the whole 'food for fuel' debate is moot... and something *started* by the corn industry to increase public&gt;thus&gt;political pressure to get qualifications (loans, tax breaks, grants, subsidies, etc) for the equipment necessary to first extract the sugars for ethanol production.. ..then the remaining components of the corn were used for feed.   Was almost always this way, and is this way today.  but, corn still sucks.   it makes unhealthier livestock, unhappier livestock, and no where near as good tasting nor healthy meats. 

on top of that, it requires way too many inputs (vs perennial grasses) and using it 'destroys' the soil.  even in no-till, it still isn't as beneficial as grasses are.  ... granted, [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass) isn't exactly the ideal grass-type for feed... 

but, it can make upwards of 1k gallons of ethanol per acre per year... (way more than corn, but paled by algae) ... ...but, [look at these roots](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Switchgrass_roots.jpg), [pic 2](http://www.mass.gov/eea/images/czm/stormsmart/factsheets/3-7-425.png)... and they can grow anywhere from 80% to 120% as deep as the grass can grow tall... which, as [pic 3](https://www.qdma.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=17469&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1262880942) and [pic 4](http://www.ethanolproducer.com/uploads/posts/magazine/resize/1328-1292434727-300x300-noup.jpg?1429150308) show, can be quite tall.

but, this is an either/or, not a both.....the cows either eat the switchgrass, or it's allowed to grow to full height.. either way, it produces one helluva lot of biomass in the soil and build the soil incredibly well.  I've run across studies that show where switchgrass is capable of adding &gt;3"" of new top soil per year in fields where it's planted... 'every year' ... ..compression kicks in and as the soil deepens, the previous years get buried but.. ..they're still very carbon-rich and very absorbing of rain, fertilizers, etc.. .as well, incredibly drought resistant.

It's also a native grass to the US with a [very large natural growing area](http://plants.usda.gov/maps/large/PA/PAVI2.png), and can grow well intermixed with other grasses that the cows much-prefer... that also have incredibly [deep, soil building roots](https://il-elgin3.civicplus.com/images/pages/N1279/image007.gif).

In short: f' corn.  and soy.  I'm not a fan. bad for the soil, bad for the profit margins, bad for the environment, bad for the livestock, and bad for us.   There're way better croptypes to grow and that require a helluva lot less inputs and provide a helluva lot more benefits.

Let's say a combo of switchgrass+algae + insects are utilized... ...and we're meeting the same demands output wise.. ...ethanol per gallon, for example..  ..switchgrass is broadcast seeded, builds soil, and grows on soils you'd *never* run a plow through.. ..  we could grow 10x as much ethanol-producing crops... or, looked at another way, utilize 1/10th as much land to grow the same amount we currently utilize... ...and,again, doing so on land we don't grow corn, soy, wheat, alfalfa, or 'other' on anyway... ..and have that.much.more.land. available, freed-up, 'whatever' for higher density, more nutritious crop-types.. ..that require one helluva lot less inputs to do so.

...and, not only that, utilizing native grasses (or 'better-suited' breeds of them anyway... gm'd, not, either, mix, 'whatever') that work seasonally with natural habitats... ..while the grasses are growing? wildlife can use them for habitats... ...when optimal harvest time comes around, most of the wildlife has already either moved on or readjusted its demands on the habitat to begin with.

949,"&gt; I'd expect that battery price/performance will continue to trudge along, making incremental improvements,

I'm too lazy to dig up articles on it but... I think Musk has the 'right idea' on the whole 18650 utilization. It's a good size, the cells are 'large enough' to store some good power, while 'small enough' to be compartmentalized-enough that no single cell's 'failure' brings down the whole.   ..and, changing a few cells is 'easy enough'.  Of course there's the whole balancing act that goes with packaging a few together, or direct-wiring each so that each cell can be monitored... ...but, 'packs of 5 or so' seem to make sense. or maybe 10. I forget how the Tesla's batteries are laid out.

I ran into a guy in a parking lot a few years ago, a retired electrical engineer. .. we shot the shit for over an hour about his Tesla.  He said they showed him a design during the factory tour where the 18650's were wired in cases... [like this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Plastic-Battery-Storage-Case-Box-Holder-For-4-x-18650-3-7V-With-Wire-Leads-DY-/262249022049?hash=item3d0f428261:g:bLsAAOSwFqJWnkx1).

the cases were wired in a row on a 'rail'... ...each case was monitored by the computer... voltage, etc.. .and charged accordingly.  If a case was acting funny, and you wanted to do the diagnosis yourself, you'd slide out the rail from under the car, pull the cases (LEDs along the rail for indicating which case it was), pull the pack, pop out each cell, put it in the tester that was built into the truck or the rail or 'whatever', and it'd test each cell individually.

The rail design had a spare pack on each one (multiple 'rails' per side, and rails on each side that would slide out from under the car)... ...so, they acted as 'spares' as well batter backups in case you ran out of power.   ... so, kinda-sorta 'range extenders' if you will. 

Anyway, it would condition each battery, each had a barcode or RFID or serial number so the car's computer (and, thus, the central database at Tesla) could keep track of which cell was in what condition... the system would make recommendations of which cells to swap from pack x to pack y... etc... and, the charge controller would balance the whole thing for optimization... ...controlling when it was pulling power from one over another, charging one.. ...all in an attempt to maximize battery life with ease as well.  said there were even talks of making the packs slightly larger so the packs could control each cell individually... ...each pack acting in serial... so, the voltage coming from each was 3.7v, but the ability to bypass certain cells, or all but one cell in a pack even... and the car would be capable of testing each cell on its own.. but, again, a size/cost balance came into play.

but, the idea was, again, each cell could be monitored, conditioned, and optimized for longevity. 

when the cells went bad, or were below the established threshold, tesla would automatically send you new cells to replace the old ones... you'd pop in the new ones accordingly, drop the old ones in the package, and send back to Tesla so they could recycle them.  -Netflix-style basically.

Seeing as how it'd be as easy as popping in and out a few cells from a remote, with LED indicator lights to notify you of which ones to swap out... ...'an idiot' could do it basically. but, of course, those that didn't want to could just opt to let the service shop take care of it.

where i'm going with this.. ... it stems from the idea that the purity of the Li-ion cells the gigafactory's going to make makes each cell... ...well, 1) last longer because there are less impurities to cause fault 2) last longer because of increased density 3) last longer because optimization and D) be way cheaper to recycle because so many impurities had been removed and the process so refined that, in short, they were 'as 'perfect' as could be'.

That leads to the idea that Li-ion is up to its max capacity.  It simply can't get all that much denser than it already is.  And, with that, the 'purer' they are, the greater control they have over the Lithium's electrons, valence shells, overall 'purity' if you will, the longer they can get them to last as well the denser.. but... it's just... .. 'not perfect'.  ...and, it never will be really.

Sure it can clearly be done to get to the distance the average person is used to driving (~300-350 miles per 'fill up') as well, the ability to alter fill-ups in such that... well, instead of 'once a week' at a gas station, it's 'every night' when you plug in... and work as well.

but, regardless... then there's the 'density/charge-speed' deal.  Like graphene or just 'super capacitors' in general... ...it won't store as much power, but it can charge incredibly quickly.   so, the idea may change.. ...the car gets 150 miles per charge or 100 even lets say, but can drive through a rest area or gas station... ...on a 'track' of sort, and, w/out even having to stop, it'll just fill up incredibly quickly on ridiculously high voltage lines... and be back on the road again in minutes... no stopping, no getting out of the car.. ...that sort of thing.

and then there's just the lifecycle of the cells.  Lithium can only charge/discharge so many times before.. ...before it needs to be replaced, recycled, and 'whatever'.   ... ...I.. ...honestly? don't entirely care.

I like ev's.  I think we should've switched to ev's decades ago.. ...but, not where batteries are the storage medium.   I mean, sure, *some* onboard batteries... ...and capacitors.. ...but, h-c chains are just way too energy dense. 

I think a sort of.. ...well, when you wrote 'less parallel-hybrid dependent' ... there'd still be parallelism to a degree.. or, in this design.. ...the idea that power would come from both an electrical storage device (battery, capacitor, 'whatever') *and* an engine... ...so, parallelism comes into play.. 

but, turbines, stirling engines.. ..'other types' .. ..just seems 'better'.  ICEs aren't the most efficient things even when set to run at one speed.  Throw in the variability of stop &amp; go traffic and then design an engine (ie, all car engines ever essentially) to do this and the ICE's efficiency drops even farther.

but, set up the engine to run at one two or even thre predetermined speeds and for set periods of time (minimal run-times really)... ...and they can be designed to be *much* more efficient... ...because, instead of stopping, going, slowing down, then speeding up again really quickly in traffic and to pass someone.. ...they just run.. ..and, the *way* more efficient em (electric motor) + battery combo ... or, battery+'engine'+regenerative braking even... or various combos... ...power the em... ...but, the power from the predetermined runtime / intensity engine is set and fixed... and as efficiently as it needs to be to match demand.


brings me back to the cells that can handle this ... and, well, the metal batteries make a lot of sense.  Maybe not the most energy-dense things around, but, then... the ability to have a very large charge/discharge lifespan... ...well... ... i s'pose you get where i'm going with that.

moving on...


your woodgas research is interesting.  Personally, I dont' see the point of direct onboard gasification. Quite simply, biomass isn't energy-dense enough for that..  imo anyway.   I think it makes more sense to have centralized processing stations.. ...biomass just doesn't make much sense &gt;25 miles, let alone 100 miles.  *despite* the politics of the US shipping pelletized biomass from Europe [link 1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/how-europes-climate-policies-have-led-to-more-trees-cut-down-in-the-us/2015/06/01/ab1a2d9e-060e-11e5-bc72-f3e16bf50bb6_story.html), [link 2](http://www.techinsider.io/europe-imports-wood-biomass-from-us-for-power-2015-12)

Again, I think it just makes more sense to process the biomass in a centralized location... more akin to Mike Cheiky's plan with Cool Planets in his Solve For X talk.    ethanol seems 'effective-enough' despite the lack of energy density of longer h-c chains..  but, the fact that ethanol 'burns' more than it 'explodes' seems like it'd, again, tied into sterling engines better than ICEs.. ..despite that being what we're doing today. 

Getting much longer H-C chains from field-based biomass just seems... ... 'tricky'.  Algenol's doing some great stuff, believe the ceo said 9000 gallons of ethanol per acer per year (vs 900 with switchgrass? if lucky? and like '90' with corn (it's more, i'm being a dick. corn for ethanol is retarded)).. + 1500 of longer h-c chains up to diesel-length.  that's pretty damn impressive, honestly. but there're others in the algae biz on reddit who've said it's 'more ideal than reality'. I'm curious about this but elaboration was 'difficult'.

That said.. ...syngas is great. I, personally, think pyrolyze switchgrass, use the biochar to make it 'carbon negative' energy and to increase yields.. ..use the syngas in gensets that currently use n.gas.. ...then use the n.gas to power cars.  or blend syngas with n.gas but.. ..H2's just 'tricky' to store. CH4 is just so much larger and so much easier... that burning the syngas quickly is just easier.. and transmitting the electricity.

F-T is 'great', but... costly.  too costly from what I've read.  I gather there are advancements. I also gather those who make them are paid to sit on them due to the competition.

The 'real' way to do that is probably just syngas&gt;to&gt;H2 &gt;to&gt;fuel cells? but, again, H2 just isn't as dense as H-C chains, unless you compress it, and that itself takes energy... so, maybe as 'dense' as HC chains, but at a cost of compression.

I don't think there's a single path forward that really 'solves' it.. ..but, *of* the paths forward, pyrolytic gasification of biomass in such that biochar is a result is the only energy production approach *I've* come across that's carbon-negative.  ...and, that says something.",2016-01-25 04:02:00+00:00,czav4xi,10.0,t1_czatdn1,2698.0,biomass

That said, I like stirling engines.. .. i've often wondered why stirling engines aren't built into cars.. ..that then are tied to a generator that produce electricity that's stored.. (capacitor, battery, both) to then power an electric motor.  ... so, a stirling engine vs ICE in, say, a Prius.

so, again, completely 'dropping' the whole 'metal-as-fuels' approach and, instead... going with the 'metal battery' deal... ..and, using 'some fuel source' (say, H-C's from biomass... algae, syngas, methane/ol, ethane/ol, etc) ... ...power the stirling engine... but that part only kicks in when the much-less-dense (metal-based) batteries are below a certain point... so, go with the whole 'the average drive drives 35-50 miles a day' deal... ..give them '35 miles of batteries' + 15 miles via regeneration... ...and, if that threshold gets within, say, 10% of being completely drained.. ...the stirling engine kicks in, pulls fuel from the HC tank, runs for a predetermined period of time... say, 15% of charge-capacity minimum... + drain (charging batteries being a secondary drain with 'unused stirling engine power' .. powering the electric motor being primary ... meaning, when pedal's depressed, power goes to motor, when pedal's let go of, or not depressed 100% of stirling engine+generator's output... ...the excess goes to charge the battery... ...when not depressed at all, the power goes to charge the battery back up


but, again, 'predetermined percentages'... ..ie, the stirling engine's gonna run for '5 minutes' no matter what... and,  up to 15. the limitation being if the key's taken out of the engine due to the car having been parked in the garage and emissions building up... ...or maybejust tie this into some sort of emissions / co/co2 sensor 2 outside the car... ..


um... but, if the batteries basically 'never lose charge' and/or lose very little charge capacity (charge/discharge capacity) ... when the car's plugged into the house, it either keeps charging, and/or the car can power the house under the whole 'timing' thing.... power rates, that sort of thing

You seem to contradict yourself..  ..for a bit of clarification: '[gasification](/r/gasification)' can happen a few ways... the main two+1 is gasification via [anaerobic digestion](/r/anaerobicdigestion) and gasification via [pyrolysis](/r/pyrolysis) ... the '+1' being plasma arc gasification (which is like uber pyrolysis) 

If you want longer H-C chains, or even H-C chains period, digestion.    You suggest (straight say) that a.d. is smaller scale... ...but the fermentation you speak of for ethanol is also digestion.. ...just, with the intention of producing ethane/ethanol vs methane.

You also acknowledge that ethanol in the US is plenty widespread (paraphrasing, of course) ... but, well, every gallon of gas has ethanol in it.. and, as such, i'd argue that it's a bit more than a 'niche technology'.

You say we'd need a geological scale digester ... ...not true, clearly.. ..as, well, again, ethanol percentages of gasoline.

There are 'mountain-sized' landfills spread all over the country/world using a.d. to accelerate the breakdown of the waste and capturing the gases produced to power 'various things'.   ....UPSs fleet in Atlanta, for example, utilizes landfill methane to power their trucks.  Waste Management's facility in Louisville, Ky [map-link](https://www.google.com/maps/place/2673+Outer+Loop,+Louisville,+KY+40219/@38.1350175,-85.7213491,849m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x88690e8cecbcda11:0xb77573311bf20aa8) is a pretty 'mountainous' facility of trash that's captured and utilized for... ...well, i believe, predominately, electrical production.  Much of SDF's airport is powered by it. There were articles years ago when it was being put in place 'advertising' it.   That UPS has such a footprint in Louisville / Louisville's airport, combined with their trucking fleet, and close proximity to this facility, I'm really surprised that UPS went with Atlanta for that project and *not* Louisville... but..

Um, the wastewater processing facility in Columbus, Oh is ... well, the landfill outside C.bus in Grove City](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.8347426,-83.0937918,2394m/data=!3m1!1e3) utilizes a.d. / methane capture..  go a bit farther up I-71 closer to Cbus and you get [this facility](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.8924808,-83.0145401,2874m/data=!3m1!1e3) that utilizes A.D. on a major industrial scale.

And, that's just ... 'around here'.   A.D. is a very established and, relatively speaking, pretty dang large industry.  Not large enough, granted, but, still... not small by any means.  

Point is, it isn't relegated to some 'afterthought' or 'experimental tech' or 'backyard farm' type of utilization.

Backing out of that.. ..I'm a fan of [syngas](/r/syngas), pyrolysis, gasification in general, etc.. ..but, i don't see one form of gasification as being mutually exclusive or 'better' than another, it's just relative to the intentions, the demand, the product, and the customer.

[Switchgrass](/r/switchgrass), miscanthus, corn stover, and other '[waste](/r/waste)' [biomass](/r/biomass) can serve a *dual* purpose in this regard..   ....first going through an a.d. step to extract and produce longer-chain hydrocarbons.. ...then utilizing the remaining pulp for paper production, a building material, compost, or sending it farther along into a pyrolysis unit to squeeze out any remaining hydrogens the a.d. didn't extract... ....and produce [biochar](/r/biochar) as a byproduct.... for all of *its* various uses. ...syngas-included.


Personally? the way i see it as best utilized?  ... swap corn with switchgrass.. ...a.d. the switchgrass, use the pulp for paper production and stop cutting down trees.   but, where markets exist, pyrolyze the post-a.d. remains and utilize the syngas for a n.gas swap.. ...or, mix with n.gas much like ethanol is mixed with gasoline.. ...'cut' the amount of n.gas needed for energy production, and utilize it for.. ...well, to go with your gas station idea.. ...most gas stations have n.gas lines running to them.. ...use these to fill up n.gas storage tanks (above or below ground) and pump up the n.gas vehicles..   ..so, if someone doesn't want to fill up at home in their Honda PHIL station.. ..or is out n about on the road.. ..they have gas station convenience.

Or, better, use the H2 from the syngas produced for the various H2 markets... ...fuel cell vehicles perhaps.

Either way, it ends up becoming a carbon negative fuel.

954,"&gt; biochar would bind some of the minerals in the soil 

yes, and helping to *keep* them *in* the soil vs potential runoff

&gt; reducing what is already low

if the soil's lacking something that you need for the crop-type you intend to grow, it seems like it'd make sense to either 1) switch crop types you intend to grow or 2) add it in  C) biochar is best pre-treated anyway.  'raw' biochar can damage the soil.  so, vs an either/or with compost or worm castings, it seems like it'd make more sense to premix them.. ...and maybe a bit more.

Josiah Hunt's approach uses biochar + flour/molasses/sugar-source + rock dust / azmoite + compost + worm castings.    the bulk being biochar and compost  ... ...the vermiculture for the microbes in it.. ..but, in dilution vs compost (compost is cheaper/easier to get/make) ... ...and, azomite or some other remineralization method to 'charge' the char.

point is: add minerals in with the char

&gt; giving back little of what is needed.

'giving back'? yeah, probably not much. It'd paramagnetically hold onto them.   but, that paramagnetic bond is 'weak'.  there's no real need *to* 'give back'... ...the microbes, fungi, and plants pull of the nutrients are more than strong enough to 'take' what is needed.   it'd be like a cheap phone book Pizza Hut fridge magnet deal.. ...sure it holds onto the fridge, and even can hold a fwe things up.. ...but, never a hard thing to take off.   so, stuff stays 'stuck to the fridge' (char, in the soil, etc) vs rushing away... ...falling on floor, 'whatever' (to stick with the analogy) ... ..but is easily removed when the dominant organisms want it.

&gt; worm castings add minerals and carbon

yeah, but no more minerals than what'd already've been in the material if it'd've simply been composted in a more traditional method.  it's the beneficial microbes and flora and a few other components of the 'structure' of the castings that are added via the [worms](/r/vermiculture).  ...and, again, compost is cheaper, easier to make, and.. ..adds minerals.  ...as well 'rock dusts' and various other 'remineralization methods'.  again, 'raw char' really doesn't work all that well.. ...many studies have showed that it even detracts.   but, once activated? totally different story.


these two videos are worth the watch [vid 1: 11m29s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7REMpeJlf64) and [vid 2: 53m31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_2SJ90ugG8)...   ....as is [this entire video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UiW3-IMfME) (41m48s) ... but, ffwd to the 20m26s mark ([should direct link to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UiW3-IMfME&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1226)) ... and, well, it's about the 'best' activation approach I've used.

..and similar to what i was already using before having seen this video.  ...granted, I've spent several hours talking with Josiah years ago may've given me a sort of 'jump start' or 'insight' into what he was doing.  but, Josiah's great, brilliant really. and, his approaches towards biochar are, ... hype about it aside.. by far, imo, the best out there. He just has a 'let's just use it' approach that moves it out of the labs, papers, theories, debates, etc.  ...and, gets it in the ground.

that said... ...biochar is its 'own thing' .. ...and, really, you 'get it' or you don't.   but, even then, there *is* still 'science' behind it in such that how the char is produced alters the characterization of the char.    as well, how the char is treated or pre-treated before application in the soil is the same.   could you just use rock dust? could you just use compost? vermiculture? etc? yeah. absolutely. of course you could... ..but, then, ... again... you 'get it' or you don't.

that said... if i had to go with just one. or just the other.  for a bed? I'd go with vermiculture.. ...but, then, they don't compete .. ...in any way other than how they hit the pocket book, and, even then, biochar can be made largely for free so... ....it doesn't really *have* to 'compete' if you're willing to put in a little bit of sweat equity.



on the animal feed... ....these are really two different subjects and your posts tend to structure them in such a way that they bleed together rather quickly and... ...sloppily.  Personally? I'm not the biggest fan of biochar for animal feed.. ...unless there's a specific reason to use it.  ...much for the reasons you mentioned about char vs soil minerals.   activated carbon is used medically for binding-to and removing toxins, poisons, etc.  If you load the char up beforehand (with vitamins, minerals, probiotics, etc) and then mix it in with the food... sure, maybe then.. ...and, as well, the char will come out the other side and be 'charged' with things from the gut, biota, etc.

There are seemingly great results from doing this.. ...from feeding animals/livestock .. humans-even .. activated carbon on a regular basis.  a reduction in methane emissions being one of them.. ...but, maybe better to use the char to help turn some of the swine effluent into a more solid substrate? ...so that it can then be blended with other solid materials to compost?   Say, pig-shit lagoons then dump in biochar... then give it a bit to absorb... then move it out and mix it with woodchips or switchgrass cuttings or some other woody waste material for composting.  in this way, the phosphorus, nitrates, and various other minerals would be held in the char, the waste produced by the farm would be drastically reduced, and.. instead of being a headache and cost to the farm, could be turned into a profitable product (compost... ...with biochar loaded into it).  ?

I know, but, I didn't say 'hydrocarbons' nor 'H2' ... I said 'hydrogen'.  My point being that we already have a hydrogen economy... all we need to change is the form we get it and the methods used to process it.

&gt; Point; We cannot just do it now.

and yet we *are* just doing it now. and have *been* doing so for thousands of years. Wood is ultimately hydrogen as well... from our use of it for a heating material anyway.

&gt; It takes significant research and development of efficient manufacturing processes

These technologies have existed for well over a century. The pyrolytic conversion of H-Cs into syngas has been done... well, /r/syngas, /r/pyrolysis, believe there are posts I've posted there about the history of it... ..if not, I'll get around to it at some point.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalGas/comments/3v1ndd/researchers_develop_a_technology_to_produce/) was about a more-recent advancement in that tech... ...but the tech itself is 'nothing new'.

&gt; as well as significant investment in laying down a safe hydrogen infrastructure across the entire country

Awesome thing is? We already have one! ...and *not* just one running to every gas station in the country... ...from gasoline, diesel, kerosene, etc... but n.gas as well.   But we also have one running to (essentially) every *house* in the country.  So, [refueling at home](http://www.cngnow.com/vehicles/refueling/Pages/refueling-at-home.aspx) is not out of the question... ...nor gas stations while on the move.

It'd just be a matter of converting the CH4 into CO2 and 2H2s.   but, since CH4 is a more stable gas-form than H2, larger, functions better at higher temperatures, ... not to mention the longer HC chains.... it's transportation &amp; storage infrastructure makes the 'most sense', imo.. ...if for no other reason than the infrastructure is already in place, has been so for decades+, and is designed to continue to be so *well* into the foreseeable future.

The 'trick' comes in in taking already-existing technology and making it something that can be done at home... next to the Phill for example... or, even better, onboard the car itself. Then capturing the CO2 and 'disposing of it' in a safer manner.  (CO2 is *not* without value... [carbon fertilization](https://powergen.gepower.com/applications/co2-fertilization.html) would couple *quite* nicely with the growing [urban agriculture](/r/urbanagriculture) 'movement' [for example](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120822005895/en/GE-Houweling%E2%80%99s-Tomatoes-Unveil-Greenhouse-Combined-Heat). 

&gt; (which no one is currently doing,

yes, yes they are actually. Just last week I worked to cut a new section in a neighborhood we build in for street and n.gas lines to run to the houses.  so, yes, a 'hydrogen' infrastructure *is* being built... quite regularly.

&gt; remember the hindenburg?)

no, I wasn't around then... but, therein lay the point about a 'pure H2 economy', it's inherently more dangerous (and less energy-dense) than a Hydrocarbon economy.  The 'trick' isn't to transport pure H2 around, the 'trick' is into making pure H2 onboard, or close enough to point of use that the 'Hindenburg-like disasters' are all the less likely to happen.. 

&gt; Elon Musk realized this

And [Toyota disagrees](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3585116-tesla-vs-toyota-battery-electric-vs-hydrogen-fuel-cell).  The internet is *filled* with stories about Tesla vs Toyota. ..and with Toyota, a company with over a decade of experience with electric cars (Prius as one example)... years before Tesla was even a company... has seemingly made their decision.

Ultimately, I see it as a 'moot point'... ...both are electric vehicles, so... whether they get that juice from batteries or from a fuel cell really makes no difference to me, for the most part... because, fundamentally, they're still the same.   Unless it's an onboard ICE burning the H2 but... why? 'Electric's better'. 

&gt; Elon Musk's goal

I'm pretty well versed in what Elon Musk's up to... I read about it daily. and have so for years now.

&gt; Elon Musk is the exception, not the rule.

Partially because he's ahead of an industry-wide push to utilize an infrastructure that, quite frankly, makes more sense if approached another way. He's out in front of and trying to push something that 'politics' plays much more a part in than technological capability.  He may be *too* far ahead of the curve, unfortunately. He won't be the first auto manufacturer to 'push the cusp' ... and, possibly fail in the process. ['Tucker'](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096316/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) is a good movie.
I suppose my point is, 'we'll see' on the longer term success of Tesla. Right now, I like it. Would buy one in a heartbeat if situations aligned... but, he's waaay out ahead right now, and that limb seems a bit.. ....shakey at times.

&gt; You're going to place this all on a single company? 

No. *I'm* not esp, but in general, I don't think it *is* placed on a single company... i just think that a single company's CEO has mustered the fanfare and public demand necessary to push it this far.

&gt; This is bigger than just toyota.

this is bigger than any single manufacturer... ...and, even, 'all of them combined'. It's an industry-wide shift... a *global* shift... that, well, changes things so fundamentally that... ...a single company doing it is dangerous.  I don't invest in / own shares of Tesla, let's put it that way.

&gt; We can't just pull hydrogen from anywhere and process it cheaply and safely. 

I just 'pulled' some hydrogen out of the rain that just fell on my house.  Others are working on 'pulling' it out of moisture from the air .... my most common form is from my n.gas line running into my house for my hot water heater and furnace... and stove... ...next most common would be my car's gas tank pulled from my local gas station, I suppose?

&gt; (We already have an electric grid, 

we already have a natural gas grid as well

&gt; there is no hydrogen grid

I beg to differ, but, then, I've stated my case on this multiple times up to this point

&gt; which makes the superchargers feasible 

I had a n.gas powered generator on an old house... came in handy when the storms would knock out the lines.. it produced electricity that, if I'd had a plug-in vehicle, I'd imagine I could've charged it up with.  Then, if I had a n.gas fueled vehicle, I could've filled *it* up *too*, I suppose... ...via that 'non-existent' hydrogen grid we supposedly don't have.

&gt; this is bottom up)

gotta start somewhere?

&gt; Technological capabilities are never a limiting factor. 

this statement seems to be in conflict with this one

&gt; It takes significant research and development of efficient manufacturing processes, as well as significant investment in laying down a safe hydrogen infrastructure across the entire country

'it takes' or 'has taken'.   as, again, most of the 'tech' already exists... and has, in one form or another, for quite some time now.

&gt; The real limiting factor is can we make mass production of an affordable unit and infrastructure feasible.

why not? are not most car companies profitable? The VW group was, for example, the wealthiest company in the world for a bit... so, yeah, sure, why not?

1043,"And yet, there's a solution... or a series of them.

Like Musk said about VW, don't have them 'fix' the cars already produced, but rather, fix the air they've already damaged.

Mechanical carbon scrubbers are now 'a thing'. China's working on their water nebulization 'canons' that push vaporized water out into the air, traps to particulates, and brings them down to the ground as dust.  

I propose a hybrid of this... and vw can play their part...  Massive industrial scale catalytic converters... ...powered with renewables.

So build out a combo of catalytic converter devices ranging in size from 'car sized rooftop fans' to industrial sized ones the size of cooling towers.   Place them strategically around concentrated areas... so, LA, NY, Boston, etc in the US, London, Amsterdam, Northern Italy, etc in Europe...  well, 'places of high concentration' anyway...

Pull the air in, run it through a catalytic converter, breaking the N2O down into N2 &amp; O2.   In the surrounding countryside, plant fast growth perennial grasses like [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass) and inoculate the soil with [diazotroph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph)-rich microbial fertilizers like those sold by [SumaGrow](http://www.sumagrow.com/)... ....the N2, O2, and CO2 will then serve as fertilization for these fast growth, carbon-negative grasses ... ...which can then be harvested, pelletized, and used for electrical generation, or for transport fuels.   The operation can actually be *powered* by this... ....so, a carbon negative, N2 reducing, soil building, fast growth perennial fertilized by the very NO2 and CO2 concentrations that are currently a 'problem' ultimately become a solution.

1071,"&gt; why are not using hydrogen directly?

It was my understanding that... ....well, from the article:

&gt; Metals have a much higher energy density, specifically the energy density by volume, than other materials proposed in  low-carbon schemes, including hydrogen. And compared to hydrogen, where storage and transport are still a major problem, metal powder is easy as pie.  ""If you think about shipping energy by ships, as we do today, we have a much higher energy density as biomass.  We ship wood chips all over the globe as one of the ways to trade clean energy, but we can do this with metal fuels on a much larger scale,"" says Bergthorson. 


and, 

&gt; Gases and liquids are much better transportable than heavy powders, even when in tanks and not pipelines. 

yeah, within limits, but, again, it's the energy density factor. For cars, trucks, etc? H2 makes more sense, but for trains, ships, etc... maybe even heavy trucks (semi's, etc) ... the energy density factor of this may make sense.  As well, for power plants.  It definitely requires a 'readjustment of perspective &amp; approach' vs biomass and H2-specifically, but ... again, 'density'.  It also reads like it's 'less explosive' than pure H2 tanks. Even gasoline and diesel tend to 'burn' more ... but a whole bunch of 16 year olds and cell phone talking soccer moms driving around in vehicles loaded up with compressed H2 seems like a slightly more dangerous idea... ...vs the other two.

1114,"From what I've read &amp; heard, it's less 'what they're preparing for' and more 'what they're trying to cover up'.

Obviously the mercury/thimerosal deal with mercury, vaccines, autism, and 'other' neurological &amp; health-in-general 'things'.

Thimerosal, and the use of mercury-in-vaccines-in-general 's ban/discontinuation went into effect back on '06... ...but, that was for the creation of *new* vaccines containing it.  Any created up to that point were/are are still green-lit to be used until the date of expiration of the vaccine itself.

Initially it was ~10 years that the vaccines were good for... ....but, the ban was coming up to vote circa ~2004, and voted on in '05 (I believe, it's been 'a few months' and 'lots of other shit read about' since then)...  so there was a push to extend the shelflife of the vaccines.  Mercury is partially added as a preservative, partially added because it increases the uptake of the vaccine by cells (essentially because it causes damage to the cell and the cell has to 'take things in' to repair themselves, including vaccines.. ..open receptors, that sort of thing).

So, now there're huge stocks of vaccines that can/will be good for 'decades' (up to 30 years for some, most 10 years still, but a whole fuck load with 15-25 year shelflives).  ... ....so, basically, each time a major batch is set to expire, there'll be a media-push to push vaccines like crazy. Vaccines are a multi-billion dollar a year cash cow to the pharmaceutical industry...  ...and that's not really going anywhere any time soon because, purportedly, vaccines *do* prevent disease.

But, well... ..again, I think it's 'less' 'what they're preparing for' and more 'what they've already been doing' (to switch gears &amp; approach).  The CDC, FDA, and WHO classifies mercury as the second most toxic element to humans... ..Uranium is #1.  'No one' comes in contact with uranium. *Every*one gets exposed to mercury.. at some level... daily.  It's just way.too.prevalent. in the world now (coal emissions, food supplies, soils, ... vaccines, amalgams, etc).   The toxicity level is set at 5ng/mL and above... with something like 30ng/mL+ generally being a 'lethal quantity'.

The issue is less 'is mercury toxic' and is more 'why is it in vaccines to begin with'?  The preservative aspect is the main reason, the second being the increase success due to increased uptake of the vaccine by the cells...  .....but, 'a conspiracy' behind it? Mercury is toxic to every.single.cell. in the body. period. Ingested mercury is much less an issue; moderately healthy foods ('vegetation' ...ie, fruits, veggies, algaes, etc) can bind to it and 'simply' remove it.. ...and even a moderately healthy [microbiome](/r/microbiome) goes a long way towards ensuring it does little damage on its way through the gi-tract.  It's the inhaled mercury that causes problems (lung damage first, then movement through the lungs directly into the circulatory system... which pretty quickly shuffles it through the heart then up to the brain).    And, of course, injected mercury... ...where 100% of the mercury makes it into the body-at-large .. ..vs ~98%+ of ingested mercury being excreted when you shit.


From here.... ...systemic damage. All over the body. In 'nano' amounts. The body will disperse the mercury as much as possible... limiting concentrations where it can... ...so, oftentimes, we're talking individual atoms of mercury, but dispersed 'everywhere' in the body.  damaging all over. so, sorta like 'death by a thousand cuts'... but, in this case, billion(s)+ cuts... ... the individual atom is damaging, 'sticky', etc... but, collectively it's like an army of little ants.

Obviously some people are better at detoxing it than others... some have better genes for it, others have better diets for it. ...but the act of detoxing it to begin with can-damage... ...and definitely does if comes into contact... as its *being* detoxed.  this backs up detox pathways (even if just temporarily) and, as such, the body, instead, just 'stores it' somewhere.   Most mercury is urinated out, so... kidney damage and urinary backup (a sign for this is dark circles under the eyes).

But, aluminum... though *way* less toxic than mercury (like 1/20th as toxic on an atom-for-atom basis), is still toxic. The human body needs no mercury nor aluminum for *any* biological use... and any level is toxic.  But, like mercury, most ingested isn't the issue, it's inhaled and injected.

Since the banning of thimerosal, mercury's been swapped for aluminum, and since aluminum is less effective as a preservative, as well, less effective at causing damage to cells... more aluminum by volume is needed to serve the same purpose as mercury.... ie, like the mercury in Thimerosal. 

That said, it's simply been a swap.  But, a 'conspiracy' behind it?  Health care. The health care industry is one of the largest industries on the planet, is only growing year after year as more and more countries adopt &amp; integrated a western-style system with western medicines into them. ... reinforced via social systems (socialized medicines) and insurance &amp; banking industries that reinforce *these*.  Thus, more and more people are.... ...buying these drugs and services.  ...and, more and more of them are backed up by each respective gov't that, in turn, is backed by its bank... which, in turn, if defaults, will just mean more and more assets owned by the debt collectors.

That said... ....wear them down. Little things. 'Countless' 'little things'.  Just ... mercury here, aluminum there, other 'toxins' there... .... a dead customer is only beneficial to the 'Six Feet Under' industry... but a living patient, perpetually sick and perpetually sold medicines that never address underlying problems that aren't even 'allowed' to be talked about w/out immediate dismissal of 'conspiracy theorist' or 'immoral anti-vaxer' etc... ...well, in short, perpetual sickness, perpetual customers.

I see it as less a ... well, it's a swap from a 'product sales approach' to a 'services sales approach'.  Don't sell them a product that 'fixes' it and let them go on their way, sell them a 'patch' that will keep them coming back for more services continually.   Vaccines are cheap (free for many), quickly made in HUGE quantities, are a simple argument/pitch, and unquestioned really in their effectiveness.  ...largely because, in many ways, they *do* work.  There are 'other approaches' that are just as capable of defending the host's immune system, as well, actually beneficial to the host, but not necessarily as cheap and definitely not as easy.  but, even that's relatively debateable. 


That said, in the specific case of these doctors? From my understanding is that 'all' the suicides in the past ~1yr have largely happened from a group of east coast doctors (though, others were involved as well) that were working together on a program... ....that was going to bring charges against the FDA on not just mercury and vaccines... and, to a lesser extent, aluminum... ...but more specifically, that they'd found ... well, [this. this borderline 'crazy' ass read](https://goo.gl/CIW09F).

The 'mercury/aluminum' deal is 'nothing new'.  Hell, it's been *over* a decade since the cases were raised and Thimerosal was banned. so, clearly, *nothing* 'new' there. Tie-ins to this enzyme being included in the vaccines? 'other' 'things' being in select vaccines with xyz serial numbers? that sort of thing?  ... hell, other vaccines in them that reprogram our body to make this enzyme (and others) to begin with? proteins, 'compounds' as well? 

I listened to both of those FUD-spewing, solution-offering videos last night... ... lots of fear and crazy conspiracy talk ..that may or may not be true... and probably is... but delivered *that*... *way*... just undermines the message. 

Fluoride is 'bad'? nothing new there. Not related to the vaccine b.s. either... and, at that, [iodine](/r/iodide) bumps out fluoride (and bromide). Detox pathways get overwhelmed so the halides end up just getting stored somewhere else in the system because there aren't enough binders for them? [boron](/r/altboron) binds to halides (boron monofluoride, boron trifluoride, boron tribromide, etc)... Heavy metal detox is 'nothing new' and 'multiple' groups exist out there, on facebook and otherwise, on helping people detox them. Dr Christopher Shade has *excellent* literature and videos out there... for free... that go into this.

Cancer? Dr Flechas, Dr Brownstein, and many others are actively treating patients with cancer utilizing protocols largely built around building and attaining iodine sufficiency. ... 'thousands' effectively treated using their approaches. ... dude goes into chemtrails and aluminum, atmospheric mercury levels from coal &amp; fossil fuel (in general) emissions... no mention of how to limit exposure and detox these... ...which is absolutely possible and done 'daily'.

but, in this specific case: there's most likely a cover-up. IF these doctors were all working in a group on the same tests and 'found something'... ....well, it'd make sense that 'someone' would 'eliminate them'. ...esp if it can be traced back to certain people (which it always can) and hold them accountable for these 'transgressions'.  It'd be a pretty big 'taint' on an otherwise incredibly profitable (and debatably beneficial) global program (vaccines).

edit: to add, as well, to go with your question... .... *to* taint a vaccine program would be to 'taint' an otherwise *excellent* delivery system *for* anything that they may ever want to get to the masses quickly and widespread.

but, then, though no evidence exists to back this up (for obvious reasons), the (possible) use of transgenic crops for the dissemination of 'foreign DNA' goes back... ....'decades'... but, again, 'nothing new'.

1135,"Personally, I prefer the replacement of strictly coal (and pelletized biomass) plants with 'gas' plants. It opens up options.

[Coal](/r/coal)... *and* [n.gas](/r/naturalgas).. ...and [biomass](/r/biomass) will 'always' be plagued with the reality that extracting the materials from the ground has an effect on the environment.. ..just like uranium, [thorium](/r/thorium), [geothermal](/r/geothermal), and even silicon for [solar panels](/r/solarenergy) or even the various 'metals' needed for solar thermal.

The 'truth' is that *any* form of energy 'extracted' is going to have an effect on the environment.. ...both in the areas around the facilities and mines, as well the 'environment-at-large'.

'Getting over' the idea that humanity is going to have a footprint and impact on the environment, I think the 'real goal' '*should*' be to do so with as less an impact *on* said 'larger environment' as possible.. ...within limits of that *really* 'mattering'.

Switching to gas burners allows for an 'openness' in feedstock-types. Just like a coal burning plant-design has the ability to have pelletized biomass (say, [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass) pellets) mixed-in-with or straight-swapped-for the coal... ...a n.gas plant has the ability to *burn* gases from all 'three' feedstock-types, and 'others' potentially.

....via [pyrolytic](pyrolysis) [gasification](/r/gasification) of the source feedstock such that [syngas](/r/syngas) is produced. Going with the logic that the gensets can be powered by varying feedstock-types (which 'most' modern ones are), this allows for a diversity of feedstocks otherwise *not* capable (or at least 'as easily capable') in more traditional coal 'furnaces'.

Similar to how a flex-fuel vehicle can burn varying ranges of fuel-types (from '100% ethanol' to '100% gasoline' and varying mixtures in between), these new systems allow for much the same thing.. ..in such that 'advanced' sensor technology allows the fuel about to be 'burned' to be analyzed for it's ratio and mixture and the genset can make the necessary adjustments on the fly to compensate for the H-densities to keep the end demand going.. ...increasing RPM where needed, slowing it down where needed, but in such that the 'demanded output' is met.

With this, biomass gasification, coal gasification, n.gas gasification (or 'cracking') is allowed... ...and, if this is done 'intelligently' and preemptively before 'whatever' fuel-type is fed into the system, then the non-hydrogen constituents can be diverted for 'other purposes'.

An few variations on this could be underground coal gasification in such that the coal is never mined (something that no matter *how* clean the coal plant itself is, 'mining' the coal can only be made so 'green') ... ...if the coal can be gasified while still underground, then the syngas produced can be brought up, cleaned up, and pumped to a reactor (gas lines, power lines, etc all have an environmental footprint as well.. ...so if the gas is burned onsite and transmitted to the end-user via powerlines, if it is pumped through a gas pipeline infrastructure to be utilized closer to the end user, a footprint and thus environmental impact is still existent)...

CH4 can be 'cracked' (and it essentially is anyway... the H is what burns in the n.gas, coal, petroleum, biomass, etc) in a pre-step before being fed into *where* it's utilized.. ..and, from here, the C (or 'Cs' in the case of longer hydrocarbon chains) can be separated and 'captured' ... ...and even serve as a nice feedstock for 'other' manufacturing processes... ...say [graphene](/r/graphene) production as an example, or greenhouse fertilization for increased crop yields and faster crop cycles as another ([ex 1](https://powergen.gepower.com/applications/co2-fertilization.html), [ex 2](http://www.ecomagination.com/ge-powers-first-co2-capturing-greenhouse-in-us), [ex 3](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120822005895/en/GE-Houweling%E2%80%99s-Tomatoes-Unveil-Greenhouse-Combined-Heat)).

So, just like separating the pyrolysis from the incineration can happen with coal, biomass, tar sands, shale, and even petroleum... the same 'pyrolysis' or 'cracking' can happen with n.gas itself (and 'other' H-C chain-types).  

To take it farther, ICEs only get... well, let's say '50% at best' (though there are exceptions of more efficiency, as well, 'most' don't even get this high) conversion of energy, fuel cells get much higher.  So *once* this 'pure H' or H2 gas-type is created from the 'cracked' H1's from the 'various' H-C chains, it can then go on to be utilized via a fuel cell with a (potentially *much*) higher conversion ration.  [Bloom Energy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_Energy_Server) systems are an example of this.

There are to near-inescapable realities of energy density: 1) *'nothing'* even remotely comes close to the energy density of nuclear feedstocks not even ... 2) hydrocarbons are ridiculously stable, 'safe', and energy dense as hell. Batteries... even graphene-based supercapacitors, are 'great', but H-C chains are 'fascinatingly' dense.  If 16 year old Molly the teenie bopper can fill up her Volvo after cheerleading practice and her parents (and society at large) can feel pretty confident she isn't going to blow herself up... and everyone else in the vicinity... ...and this has been shown to be the case for going on a century now... ...I think it's pretty safe to assume that H-C chains are 'pretty safe &amp; reliable'.   I've seen 'plenty' of cars caught on far on the side of the interstate, and even one or two at a gas station... but I'm 'old', and even with this it's been pretty few &amp; far between and pretty safely contained at that.  H-C chains are 'great'.  Nuclear is possibly 'greater' ... ...but, maybe not from the perspective of trusting 'Redneck Bob' from driving around in a [thorium powered car](http://energyfromthorium.com/2014/04/13/mythology-thorium-car-thorium-plasma-batteries/).

It makes more sense (imo) to keep these a bit more 'contained' ... ..at least until 0) systems are built to begin with such that 1) they can evolve to prove safe/safer/'safe-enough' designs are possible (they most likely are), and a system of accountability can be put in place that ensures a drastically reduced likelihood of mishandeling, proper maintenance, and safety (persons, property, and environment).  'Redneck Bob' dismantling a nuclear reactor to 'tweak' his HP with a U-T blended fuel so he can beat 'greasehead Gary' off the starting line may not be the 'safest' nor 'wisest' idea.  So some sort of 'VET-style' testing and 'tamper proof seal' around them may help to limit &amp; deter... ..as well maybe a sort of 'take it to a Valvoline once a month in lieu of the gas stations you'll never have to go to again' so that some certified minimum-wage 'kid' can verify said seal hasn't been broken.... in some sort of '5 minute process' ... ...with regular fines and legal recourse just like if you turn your water meter back on after service has been disconnected or 'cut the thing' on your gas line to your house or 'whatever'.

Either way, something else that this allows for is an expansion on the 'biomass for energy/fuel' approach.  Thus, utilizing crop-types with high lignocellulosic values (like switchgrass, fast growth trees, bamboo, etc) in such that large volumes of carbon are sequestered in their growth... not only would a 'carbon-neutral' fuel-source exist, but a carbon *negative* one... ...and, if processed 'properly', a resulting [biochar](/r/biochar) can be (and is) created that can be blended with the [soils](/r/soil) in such that said crop yields are *increased* while *de*creasing their inputs and environmental footprint.

But, moving away from that and bringing it back to the sub's focus: another 'great way' to get to these more-easily-accessible 'hydrogens' would be to use a small modular reactor to generate the heat &amp; energy necessary to produce high pressure steam that can then be injected into these coal, shale, sand, and methane 'seams', 'cracking' the H-C's before ever leaving the ground... ...and, bringing up the H in such that it can be stepped up to H2 or 'whatever' in such that this energy-dense for of fuel can be used for more portable applications (cars... utilizing ICEs *or* fuel cells... or 'both' I suppose? some hybrid design?... , trains, planes, iPhones, walkmens, boomboxes, and retro gameboys or PSPs).

Obviously if/when/as these proven reserves of these longer H-C chains begin to become deplete, we'd already have a very developed &amp; mature infrastructure in place that would allow for a 'switching-over' of utilizing sea water as the source for the H... ...or, just recycle the captured byproduct of the fuel cells (pure H2O) in such that it can be reprocessed to... ...provide our H2 again... ...ie, 'recharging' our device simply means plugging it in to an external power source and taking the 'closed loop' H2-to-H2O system and 'recracking' the H2O back into H2 and simply emitting the O.  maybe combine 3 of 'em together and sell the system as an ozone generator capable of purifying the air around you while it happens [Sharper Image-style](http://www.sharperimage.com/si/view/product/Ionic+Comfort+Quadra+Air+Purifier/201114).

Not sure if this the line of thinking you were going for when you stated ""I am interested in an examination of the effects of replacing coal with natural gas"", but, then, you weren't really all that clear as to the line you'd like to take those examinations down, so it kind of left the direction open to the interpreter. :)

speaking of electromagnetic weapons capable of disrupting the electrical systems of incoming missiles, it seems someone would've done something about his pacemaker's internal circuitry by now

&gt; If a billion people died a hundred years ago, it might have been the end of the human race

estimates of 1900 put the global population at 1.56-1.71b. 15 years later (ie, 100 years ago / 1915) it was 2b.  we'd've 'been fine' as a species.  as a civilization-even for the most part.

going with the mindset that it'd affect all cultures / countries equally, we'd've bounced back... ...and 'fast' probably.  Again, data. Written records, redundancy, etc.  esp now.  Maps, plans on how to build things, science, knowledge... ...books, etc. 

obviously lots of talent and skill would be killed, so a definite hit-loss there, but if the overall 'data' of it is recorded, people would learn pretty quickly.  

I'm not saying we'd be at 7b population in 2015, but i think the growth that'd come from a thinning out like that would be faster than it'd've been had it not happened.. ...obviously there'd be 'catch-up' to do but, all in all, people would flourish via utilizing the freed up resources that were relatively readily available *from* a 'thinning out' like that.   ...depending on what caused it, of course  but, the only thing widespread enough to really cause that is an asteroid or plague.  and, really, more a plague.  maybe a super volcano Yellowstone-style but... ... 

Wired did a piece right after sept 11th in one of their issues. a sort of 'open source come together' trying to figure out the best terrorist attacks on the country.  people commented on the site all sorts of ideas... ....and then they put it all together and published it.

The conclusion was one that took out dams in like Montana or some such northern state... ... had the dams named even... ...and how that would create a flood downstream that would take out each subsequent dam and make it all the way to the Pacific. Knocking out infrastructure for pretty much the majority of the western half of the country and, obviously having global ramifications.

1147,"&gt; that means the term 'world war' is obsolete

isn't it kind of though? or, at least, since globalization, internet, etc it's taken on kind of an entirely new meaning.

&gt; If it's more convenient for world powers to hire others to fight their wars

[nothing new there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans_in_the_American_Revolution) ... and, also, nothing 'cold' about that war

&gt; then we're dealing with cold wars, not world wars

I seriously doubt the people in Syria thought think of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQpxNA-uku4) as being 'cold'

all these wars are 'covers' anyway.

since 2003, &lt;2m people in iraq have die. Tragic? yes. but still... 2m.

In contrast, 2012 estimates for global deaths from cancer are 8.2 million.

During WWII, an average of 10m people a year were killed. Granted, percentage-wise, the population's a lot larger now, but this is just cancer... and '[the number of new cases is expected to rise by about 70% over the next 2 decades](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/)'  ... it's rising faster than that but I don't feel like digging up the statistics to back that up. just,... take my posting history &amp; frequency at /r/altcancer as at least a level of evidence that I 'read a lot about cancer'...


That said, [from here](http://www.cancer.org/research/cancerfactsstatistics/cancerfactsfigures2015/index), ""In 2015, there will be an estimated 1,658,370 new cancer cases diagnosed and 589,430 cancer deaths in the US.""

In contrast, total military &amp; civilian deaths of US soldiers/citizens was 418,500 from the whole of WWII [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties)

granted, again, percentages / population size... ...but, [cancer is largely preventable](https://youtu.be/ZBM2qWKkFxE?t=2222) ... granted, so is war if 'strategery' &amp; discretion is shown...

I suppose my point is... ...'war' is the 'distraction' when it comes to death rates.

and, yet, even with cancer, tb, 'aids' (less an issue now), malaria, etc and all the other diseases people die of... ...

well, let me re-approach this a different way...

Let's go with the [highest on this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics) of 90% to be extreme... ...even if 90% were wiped out (unlikely, but let's go for it)... ...at the [current level of 7.386b](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) worldwide... 90% still leaves ~738.6m people ~1750? (1700 was 650m, 1800 was 1b.. so, split the difference?)

1750 ... population levels... ...with today's science, understanding, resources, and... ...assuming it happens from some sort of plague or pathogen and gov'ts are relatively able to maintain safety on their nuclear stockpiles during this such that they aren't gotten ahold of by terrorists or rogues with deathwishes and the sort... ....  I think we would bounce back incredibly quickly.

Much faster than the 265 years that it's taken us to get to this point.

1150,"&gt; In the second Cold War, it would not surprise me if we developed defensive capabilities against nukes.

I would argue that we already have them... and have them in place.  The 'quality' of the technology varying by country involved but... ....I see Israel's 'iron dome' as a 'mini-version' of this tech.. ...and, really, rail guns and various electromagnetic weapons as the next level.  Lasers and such as well, of course.

Why would anyone (country) who has this tech *talk* about it? ...*esp* given what you're suggesting ... ie, a lead up towards a hot war...   ...the time it takes tech to go from 'top secret'/classified to public awareness can take *decades*... ...and, in the case of various overlapping defenses against 'the ultimate weapons' ... which are a threat that we (the world) have faced for going on 60+ years now... ....why would *any*one want this talked about? Deploy it. don't talk about it. 

&gt; which, as you say, will become increasingly likely as everywhere becomes less stable.

I don't really think 'everywhere' will become less stable.  I see the western hemisphere as largely protected against the types of instability in other, closer, more-immediately-land-accessible countries.

I'm not really convinced a 'collapse' is going to happen... per se. I see it as being highly likely, and the conditions are set to escalate quickly amongst *many* nations, but, by &amp; large, I think it'll 'work itself out'.

I think that Hillary's terrorist attack .. her '9/11' that'll likely happen within her first year'ish in office will be to her what 9/11 was to Bush.. ...in such a way that it'll give her the ability to rally the country &amp; world behind her... ...and, UN-style (*not* 'coalition of the willing'-style) mobilize an invasion into the middle east that will get us out of this quagmire Bush &amp; Cheney dragged us into nearly 15 years ago.

Putin is a smart smart guy. He 'gets' what's up. the Clintons are as well.  I see the Putin 'regime' (administration) as *being* largely backed *by* the Clintons.. ...and China's current structure as being so as well.  

China'll be the ones that're gonna get pissed... ...but, there won't really be a whole lot they'll be able to *really* do about it once the  (Clinton-)US and (Putin-)Russia are back on the same page... ...more or less.

Mop up work of the Bush/Cheney mess... ...is long overdue. but, *not* under Obama's watch. He's the 'set-up' for it. He's as much as neo-con puppet as he is a socialist.  Sure, on the one hand he's 'Obama' and 'fox news hates him', but on the other, he's continued or *expanded* pretty much everything Bush put into place.. ...

Cheney's still funking around in Israel..

Once they get their pipeline through Lebanon &amp; Syria... through Turkey, and into the eastern european markets.. .. and start collecting commissions from the Saudi oil &amp; gas going into it as well.. ...they'll 'get their payoff' and, ultimately, the 'Cheneyahu' coalition will be sidelined and forced to stfu while Hillary (with Sanders as her VP) implement the 2-state solution with Palestine that Bill should've nearly 20 years ago before he got out of office.


China's gonna get pissed... ...but, my guess? Japan, S.Korea, India, and the US trade relations (w/ other s.e. asian nations ala TPP+India) will create *quite* the 'box' for china.

And with the Clintons *finally* pulling their money out of China.. ...and with the newly created UN force still strong from the middle east mop up.. ...human rights and other WTO standards will start to be imposed on China again... ...and hard... ...with the US &amp; 'west' saying 'it's india's turn' at the table.

A lot of this is what I'm reading between the lines in Paris right now (/r/climatenews) and, well, I see trade with India becoming *quite* a big deal over the next few decades.

... ....terrorist attacks? almost definitely the case.  terrorist nukes? probably.  a lot of jealous pissed off parties will be created in the rearrangements to come.

&gt; realise how recent the problem really is


*this* is the point that I feel is lost on most people.  They look to history to compare things to and, really... .we've *never* been here before. Ever. Nothing even close.  Technologically, geopolitically, and, most importantly to all of it, population-wise.

It's obviously very clearly unprecedented. ... but, there's safety in numbers. 100 years ago, knock out 10% you killed 100m.  Mao did that '50' years ago.... well, Mao, Stalin, Hitler, etc (70 to include hitler, but now we're well over 100m also)

10% now? 730m... ...*but*, there's still 6.5b left... .ie, the population circa 200***5***.   I remember 2005. Quite clearly, in fact. It wasn't that long ago.  We had *plenty* of people to make a pretty quick recovery population-wise.

10b.  I put the planet 'comfortably spaced' at 10b.  25b realistic. and 100b people could be supported if we really took over the entire planet and made everyone robot-efficient.

I don't think it'd be fully sustainable for a super long time.. ...but, by the time we got there, we'd be offloading people like crazy to other plants. Mars is a good size. Europa's no 'baby moon' and the moon itself is the size of N.America surface-area-wise.  What's gonna wack me out more is if/when/as N.America reaches 1b people.  but, even then, India's already 1.252b and it's 3.287m sq km... ...N.A.'s 7.5x that in size. so, if India can do it, N.America definitely can.  ....which is all the more terrifying to me.

But, my point is, the whole war could be fought (and 'lost') in under 20 minutes... a half hour phone calls would be made, and within an hour a cease fire and peace talks would start.. ...most likely?

I'm not a fan of this. I don't think it has to lead to this... ...one way or another. I... ...like people. esp 'innocent' ones.  so i'm not advocating for this, I'm just pointing out that the stage is relatively set for it and advancements are being made continually in posture towards/against this.

I think... ...well, I think the world would be much better off if nuclear weapons quite simply didn't exist.  ... or existed only within *extremely* controlled circumstances... and even those are questionable.  I mean, if all decisions for the use of nukes could only be made by NATO... and not its individual respective countries.. for example... ..that still puts a NATO vs Russia thing on the table.  ...and, well, if there was a backout to some UN-controlled decision / review-board for nukes.. ... ....who would vote to use nukes on their own country? Ie, any sitting country at the UN table would know that the UN members just voted to authorize nukes to be used on a country... ...and, 'why?' there'd really be no need... ...*unless* that country'd already gone rogue, and even then... ...why?

Nukes should be contained, disassembled except for a select few? for 'whatever' reason... ...and their feedstocks used for nuclear energy fuel.. ...China &amp; India's interest in MSRs is nice place to look for that.   but, then... ...what happens when you throw a jelly donut out the window while driving down the interstate? it lands on the side of the road, ants find it, their population explodes to utilize it.. ..and, once consumed, they either go out and find more jelly donuts, conquer more territory to support their numbers... ..or they die back.   so, likening 'infinite energy' to 'a jelly donut' .. ...well, therein lay the problem with nuclear on that level: 'infinite' energy ('infinite' being relative of course... 'infinite' from a human civilization/use perspective... ....there's a *lot* of nuclear feedstock out there).. ...'infinite' energy could lead to 'infinite' population growth... ...and, thus, a max-level of earth's systems happens and 'Manifest Destiny' to the cosmos ensues.... moon, mars, europa, etc then beyond... ....is *that* 'sane' too??

either way, whether or not major population reduction is undertaken or not (ie, flashpoint wars)... ...humanity is still progressing.  'intelligence' and 'sustainability' are what're necessary, I think.  'responsible' reproduction rates.

but i definitely don't advocate mass die off populations... ...esp if it involves nuclear murder or genocide by bioweapons.

But, yeah, even 'a few nukes exchanged' between India &amp; Pakistan would wreak all *sorts* of death &amp; destruction... ...even if more-advanced 'clean bombs' that have dialable yields and are coupled with precision targeting systems... ..it's just... ...'dangerous posturing', imo.  Ludacris and insensible.

&gt; Tensions are not currently less than they have been. Tensions have not been this high since the Cold War, and they will only get worse

and they'll only mount.  With the [Iran-India pipeline](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/539701/with-nuclear-deal-india-looks-to-iran-for-natural-gas/) bypassing Pakistan, and negating the need for the [Iran-Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Pakistan_gas_pipeline) routes... ....well, it'll only become more so... ...as India 'prospers' from the development that comes from that new energy source and trade relations and grows... ... 'leaving Pakistan behind' as it does... ..or, outpacing Pakistan's growth... ...tensions are sure to only continue to mount.

&gt; WWIII is inevitable in the long run

most likely, yes.  But, even the Russians don't call WWII 'WWII'... ...so, a 'third world war' will probably happen, but it doesn't necessarily have to happen (nor is it likely to) in the traditional 'Terminator' sense of it... ...some 'end all be all judgement day' level.  It'll be... ...'larger readjustments of the map' ... ...there's simply 'no profit in it' to blow us all up. 

but, at that, there've been &gt;5000 wars in human history, many being fought currently, and there's no reason to think that many many more won't be... ....with culminations towards larger 'world-scale' wars that could be called WWIII, WWIV, WWV, etc.  ...esp when looking back.   Hell, when looking back 100 years from now, what's going on *now* may be considered WWIII when looked at collectively... ...and, with what's posturing itself *to* happen.

Keep in mind, 'The Crusades', 'The Opium Wars' etc didn't happen in '4 short years' or 'less than a decade' ... ...yet history still 'lumps them' into a 'wars' despite being more a series of battles... ...really it's only when the US gets involved do they happen fast, clump into larger theaters, and go wider scale like they do.. ...   I suppose my point with that is, 'whatever' history looks back and calls these x-hundred years from now... it may *be* called WWIII???  and we may be sitting right smack dab in the middle of it.

but, i'm optimistic as well... i mean, even if we are... ....you're (presumably) in India. I'm in the US. granted I haven't travelled to India (yet) but I've been to over 20 other countries around the world, from the Urals to western-Australia and many in between (from a western hemisphere perspective)... ...and, one of the convos I had multiple times while in Russia with 'the locals' was built around the concept of 'pleb on pleb' hatred... ...and how we had absolutely *none* towards one another. ... same with Iran.. ....I've met &gt;25 iranians? like, had conversations-with, known for years, etc.. ...not a single fucking one of them has not ceased to impress me.  seriously. granted a 'certain-type' comes to the US or other areas I'd interact with them (having not made it to Iran... [though, would really like to](http://www.trueactivist.com/a-guy-rode-his-bike-through-iran-and-what-he-saw-will-likely-surprise-you/))... ...the 'collective lot' of them impress me as much if not more than the Iraqi's, Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, Saudi's etc.  Not that it's a pissing contest, it's just... well, like the last link says, they all seem really nice? and intelligent.

This whole war posturing saber rattling b.s. is... ...going to prob lead to some major conflicts ... is totally avoidable, and absolutely-and-completely unfortunate.

but, then, if it doesn't happen? if people keep breeding?  even if we can sustain it, I don't think it's the best way forward.

5 billion, more evenly spaced... ..seems a 'safer' way to do it. :) but, 10b seems 'doable too'... hopefully we make it there w/out major incident. ...which, though not 'inevitable', is most likely 'unlikely'.

1153,"When a few nukes finally go off in Pak &amp; India ... and possibly China... ...it'll thin out he population quite a lot.

It may take 10-25 years but... with China's over-male population... I'm surprised it hasn't happened already.  I can't find the study right now but historically, when any population gets greater than something like 1% population of men over women, war almost always happens within that society within that male-dominant generation (exact opposite for female-dominant populations but, different story.. ..though I do believe it pointed out that 'skirmishes' were more common with them.. but wars less so)


anyway... you get as many men as china currently has and in their ripe age of mid-20's with no women around?   w/out some *major* social engineering going on (drugs in water supply sort of thing).. ...I'd be really surprised if a war didn't kickstart. 

And, well, India, China, and Pakistan are all nuclear states... and in turf wars... so... ...quick way to thin out a couple hundred million+ people... ... and it could even be kept pretty localized regionally speaking as well.  The west wouldn't (really) need to get involved in that one too too much so... ... as long as the US &amp; Russia keep their wits about themselves relative to it... ... 

kinda f'ed up though.  I think about this while looking at the cultures of those two (three.. but i don't pay much attention to pakistan) countries... ..interact with their generation... kids, etc.. ....and, more or less at one point or another jumps into my head that it's like talking to a brit or a german or a frenchie circa 1905 or 1910 or something.

It may never happen, and for humanity's sake, I hope it doesn't... ..but, statistically speaking, historical context, and just grudgematch 'whatever'...... I'll truly be surprised if it doesn't

Granted the geopolitical landscape has changed a bit in the past 15-16 years, but ran across [this article](http://metro.co.uk/2015/12/05/we-all-nearly-died-in-a-nuclear-war-in-1999-5546410/?ito=twitter) (with a sensationalist headline) just a few hours ago... .... it wasn't far from [this headline](http://www.businessinsider.com/a-top-us-navy-intelligence-official-is-warning-of-future-conflict-with-china-2015-2?IR=T&amp;r=UK)  ... ... I wouldn't be surprised for a second that if the US &amp; China got into a 'tussle' in the South China Sea, ... ...if a 'two-front war' wasn't created with China in such that they were drawn into a conflict on their western front.. ..ie, India &amp; Pakistan.. ..just to keep the US from getting too sucked into a war with another 'million man army'

Just 'cause the politics has changed, and the tensions are (currently) less than they have been doesn't mean for a second those things can't be triggered and heightened in a second.   not right.this.instant. of course but in a matter of weeks to months at any point that the population situation 'your country's' 'ignoring' (as you claim) gets too too far out of hand.

Travel up. Remember the north for what it was and is now.. ..it most likely won't be that way by the time we're our parents' age.

1154,"I suppose it's all relative.  Vertical farms certainly aren't the cheapest things around square footage-wise.... 

...and, urban farms in general ...

ex: Guy/couple lives down the street from one of my rental properties.  Right in the middle of the city. Right on one of the busiest streets *in* the city.   Most of the yards are a pretty good size, hell, ours is 3.5 acres... ....but, his is 14+

He farms it. maybe an acre or so of yard, the rest is corn and soy and 'other' crops. He does it on rotation.

14+ acres.  Targets, Walmarts, grocery stores, H.Depots, Lowes, etc all around... and plenty of other 'big box' retailers... ...closer to the city, and almost just as many farther out from the city if you continue down the road.

The property's worth millions. He's grandfathered in before city-county merger and the city simply can't make him budge.  He won't, his wife won't, their kids won't.   I've talked to him, multiple times.  Great guy. Think what he's doing is awesome.

We've even talked about farming it differently... about setting *up* a much denser operation.. ... a 'food hub'urban ag style of sort with much greater output than 'corn'.  (I'm not a fan of corn... nor soy).


He's down, he's just not gonna do it himself and I would need to make sure to commit strongly to it before he'd let me do anything... but he'd definitely let me do something if I showed that level of commitment.

Either way... in his case? with 14+ acres right next to each other like that? I won't say it's '$1m an acre'... ..that'd be a bit much... but, to say $500k an acre? ... when taken as a whole (who has 14 acres in the middle of a city like that???) ... yeah, it wouldn't surprise me one bit.

There're a few other spots around town that're similar.  There's one right next to Southeast Christian Church (ie, 'Six Flags Over Jesus') ... SCC's got *lots* of money.  Been on this lady for *years* to buy it... decades actually.

Lady won't budge. I think she's a rockstar.   The same goes for the green N of 64 but E of 913 ... We've built many houses for the owner of that, but he inherited it and refuses to sell it.  The land value is... ...well, any assessed value (as per the sheriff's page) would be undervalued for tax purposes... ...who wants to volunteer to pay more taxes on their land?...

but, well, hell, due west of the complex is the same... ...those guys run it as a nursery, same deal. they refuse to sell... or, well, won't unless it's the right price.

But, there're more than a few areas like that around the country.... .... an 'island of farmland' that's otherwise completely surrounded by urbania that's 'worth millions' but otherwise used for some cows, sheep, ducks, and corn.

I, personally, think it's awesome.  ... for the most part.  I think there're elements of it that're 'give it up' but... 

well, shit, [here's another one](https://www.google.com/maps/@38.2376748,-85.6062724,2043m/data=!3m1!1e3) ... just west a mile or three *from* Jesus' s.eastern headquarters... ... [Oxmoor Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxmoor_Farm) ... ...  she's already donated the entire shopping mall on the north side of the property, 'gave in' and allowed the neighborhood to the NE side to be developed (decades ago) and the south-side of 64.

'they've' tried everything and then some to get her to sell.  taken her to court, attack ads, etc etc.  You can even see where the neighborhood's roads deadend right at the boundary of the farm...

they insulted her a few years back in court... ...someone said (loudly enough) that 'we'll just wait 'til she dies' and she overheard it and got fuming pissed.  Little old lady, sweet as hell (and wealthy as fuck too... and *very* intelligent) ... ... I gather she's since locked the whole thing up in trust and such and it's... ... it'll be difficult as hell for the city to force it

1174,"I'm not really sure where to jump in as there hasn't really been much discussion on the topic up to this point... 

I suppose I'll just say that the 'carrying capacity' of the planet is such a debatable thing. There are sooooo many variables that go into that, and just as many variables that can be changed that can adjust for it.

Is everyone eating cow? what about cow fed insects? what about a portion of our protein gotten *directly* from insects.  1/3rd of the world's population consumes insects on a near-daily basis.  Hell, much of the west consumes insects on a daily basis, just as partial ingredients in processed foods.

What about [chlorella](/r/chlorella), [spirulina](/r/spirulina), or other [algae-types](/r/algae)?  Very dense nutritional capacity and can be grown out in the open ocean... ...'lots' of space out there.

Fish farms are increasing their densities regularly, and the [urban agricultural](/r/urbanagriculture) movement is just really beginning to get started and is showing *great* potential... ... and it goes way beyond 'gardening' ... ...which, to throw it out there, [Russians get 40%](https://thebovine.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/in-1999-35-million-small-family-plots-produced-90-of-russias-potatoes-77-of-vegetables-87-of-fruits-59-of-meat-49-of-milk-way-to-go-people/) of their [produce from backyard gardens](http://naturalhomes.org/naturalliving/russian-dacha.htm).

Materials are almost infinitely recycled. It's less a 'whether or not' and more a 'how' ... and a 'how to do it most efficiently'... ...and, well, to be cheesy but, as /u/Will_Power alluded to, one of the best ways to 'recycle material' most efficiently is to not need the material in the first place... ..water, fertilizer, minerals, etc.

'[Waste](/r/waste)' is very rarely actual 'waste'... it's just something that hasn't been properly utilized for its next task.

Now, I have no doubt that there *is* a finite carrying capacity on the planet... after all, the planet itself is finite.......but I'd imagine that the 'comfort' factor would come into play *far* sooner than the actual carrying capacity.

Having the mental capacity to reorganize our way of thinking about things is more easily allowed while not in a 'hating' fear-filled mindset that it's 'us or them' because 'the planet is finite'.

...and your response still doesn't address the increase of atmospheric carbon over the past ~150+ years due to releasing once-geologically stable carbon into the atmosphere.  ...thus, even if atmospheric carbon levels were reduced *back* to ~250ppm, plants were still thriving quite well at those levels.

atmospheric carbon levels are at like 400ppm... they were 250ppm 160 years ago.   Plants grew fine then.  They have even more now.

We've pulled up so much carbon and nitrogen from geologically stable regions and pumped it into the atmosphere, plants should be (and *are*) growing better than ever in many cases.

1239,"Here, I finally got around to [digging this up](https://www.reddit.com/r/livestock/comments/3nbipu/industrial_farming_is_one_of_the_worst_crimes_in/) for you... note: I posted it.. ..a month ago.

I by no means disagree that the industrial livestock industry is essentially cruel as hell. ... and long overdue an overhaul in how it's approached.

But, I'm also not a vegetarian, let alone a vegan. My ancestors didn't give me the genes for my canine teeth for no reason... nor my cats, nor my dogs.

Animals eat animals, insects eat animals, bacteria &amp; fungi eat animals... hell, even plants eat animals.

There are various arguments around that make very strong cases that the *lack* of animal consumption in a vegetarians diet *causes* more problems than it *solves*.. .. there are many compounds that are much easier gotten via animals than simply supplying the human body with the necessary minerals via plants and having it create them itself from scratch.

Not just that, there are valid reasons for killing animals... ...many of them convoluted given human encroachment into their territories, but I'm also not 'anti-human'... ..if you want that, /r/overpopulation is probably a great scene for you.

but, I also wouldn't call it a holocaust... even though it technically fits the definition:

&gt; hol·o·caust
ˈhäləˌkôst,ˈhōləˌkôst/Submit
noun
1. destruction or slaughter on a mass scale, especially caused by fire or nuclear war.
""a nuclear holocaust""
synonyms:	cataclysm, disaster, catastrophe; More

&gt;2.historical: a Jewish sacrificial offering that is burned completely on an altar.


again, *though* it technically fits, given 1) its historical context... it's just 'bad use' of the word. overly dramatic, insensitive, and non-reflective of an efficient way to argue the case

2) it only fits the first half of the first definition... ...with the latter half implying war or some sort of attempted genocide.

but, technically, yes, there *is* a 'slaughter on a mass scale' that's involved in the livestock industry.  and there will continue to be.  esp when such arguments as comparing it to a holocaust are made... ..it just turns off any 'rational' person who otherwise may listen to a case relating to why it should be ended (which I feel the article I linked to above does a much better job at doing... albeit, in many more words as well).

That said, I also think that... ...going with the idea that you *read* the article (I think you'll really like it, it's a good article, well written, and, imo, *worth* the read)... ...what we're doing with livestock goes *well* beyond 'a holocaust'.   

To still with the more-recent historical precedence for the word 'Holocaust', yes, the Nazi's *did* use slave labor. ... and yes they then killed then 'cooked' (the bodies) of that labor in mass extermination &amp; genocide.

but, arguably just as inhumane... ...in a different light... ...comparing atrocities is such a slippery slope... ...is *not* ***just*** the enslavement then genocide of a peoples.. ..but... and better compared to the livestock industry.. ..is the US during its slave years (ie, nearly 2/3rds of its history).  ...we aren't just 'harvesting, enslaving, slaughtering, then 'cooking' these things.. ... we're doing it at an industrial scale... ..and as a form of policy and industry (which, granted, the Nazis did with the victims of the holocaust as well).. ... but, we're also breeding them.  and, not just selective breeding with pints of semen going for thousands to tens of thousands of dollars even... ...but going even farther than that with applying genetic modification and, essentially, some of the most advanced technologies at human availability towards the better-refined continuity of this.

Your comparison of a holocaust (while technically correct), quite simply doesn't truly encompass the extent of what's actually going on.  In fact, it falls *far* short of it... ...and, not only by implying that once the destruction and slaughter of a 'finite' number of afflicted is achieved it will end.. ...but, also, by using inflaming and deterring words that, quite simply, make your case sound ridiculous and serve to repulse anyone who may otherwise be willing to listen... away.

It's just an ineffective, borderline offensive, and incredibly limited way to view the *industry* that's actually taking place... ...and seemingly has no intentions of changing in any way other than *in*creasing what it's already doing.

Not that insects 'deserve' to die for humanity's continued existence any more than animals and mammals with deep and complex emotions, but they're a decent alternative... ...and, if you check out /r/livestock, you may see that I've posted many about that budding industry as well.

Check out the video, its focus is on india.

I can't find a link atm but there was a bridge from Malibu into LA funked up from an earthquake tremor deal so badly that it had to be replaced... ....back in the late-'90's.

Federal level kicked in because it was a federal road and Clinton (Bill, obviously) did it as a sort of competition.  The company that came in as the lowest bid *and* the fastest time... ..got priority, and then a 'bonus' was given for each week/month ahead of schedule they could do it.

The company that won was &lt;60% lower than the next cheapest (on price), &lt;60% faster... ...on estimated installation...   ...and they came in even faster than that when they actually installed it.

They prefab'd all the sections of the road in their factory (I believe in Minnesota or something) then just shipped them in.... while the crews were doing the demo work and prep work.  When they got there, they installed in a very short period of time.

They were something like 6 *months* ahead of their estimated 15 or something.  The hoorah over it was that they came in *so* far ahead of schedule that they *shouldn't* get the bonus.. ..because they weren't expecting to have to pay out that much more.  I believe it actually went to court and got settled behind closed doors.. ...hence *one* of the reasons it isn't the easiest story to find.

They were using recycled plastics... nearly 20 years ago.

The 'plasticity of plastic' helps the asphalt heal itself under the heat-stress of lots of cars.  It heats up, readjusts, then cools back down again.. ...and it lasts longer.

*That* was, in fact, the company's goal during the initial announcements ... ..they wanted federal contracts to rebuild *all* the bridges.. and, to be the material suppliers for federal roads.

In short: roads that are better, last longer, cheaper, faster to install, and require way less labor to do.  It... ...has actually been kept surprisingly quiet... ..given the 'tech' behind it and the benefits... ...but, then, politicians 'win a lot of votes' for employing people with road projects ... ....to all of a sudden *lose* that 'mechanism' ... ..as well, to undermine all their other, current suppliers, contractors, etc favor due to swapping to an advanced tech.. ...it was like when AT&amp;T was the largest employer in the US back in ~2000, and they were losing their ass to fiber companies killing their $0.05/min long distance cash cow... and threatening to lay off everyone basically... ..creating a major economic &amp; political shit storm in the process... ...and then the AOL/TW merger was announced... then (illegally?) approved... ..and the whole thing stfu.


but, given the [current state of our infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpzvaqypav8), I'd say *some*thing'd better happen ... and sooner than later otherwise the evening news is going to be (most likely *not*) filled with people dying on failing &amp; collapsed bridges or due to failed roadways vs colorado planned parenthood shootings and Trump's shenanigans.

1241,"&gt; The effectivity of local safety organisation in the respective countries will surely have an effect on the data.

Good point. Maybe China's OSHA sucks too.  But, I'm not Chinese, nor do I conduct a business in China where OSHA inspectors come into play. I *do* in the US, and I can assure you, getting on the roof of a house (of which I've gotten on literally *hundreds*)... ....OSHA (or, more, the 'fear of OSHA') doesn't make it safer, it makes it all the more nerve wracking and accident prone.

...or, completely stifling on how quickly the job can get done. Following (all of) their codes here would make a project go soooo much slower. California is even worse.  Safety first, yes, but OSHA still sucks. I've paid thousands in fines for OSHA violations, and had projects shut down for *weeks* awaiting b.s. OSHA bureaucracy to takes its course.  Paying those fuckers of really *is* cheaper &amp; easier.

I'd imagine in the nuclear industry they're even *more* annoying. Walking around with their little clipboards and paper demands. ...and their stupid little hard hats and waiting on them to change their f'ing office shoes to some pair of designer work boots that they wear just to walk around a job site and do absolutely no work other than check their little boxes and ask their nosy little questions while giving their stupid little judgemental looks.  ...and, paying the workers to take an early lunch or while they leave the jobsite for an hour or two only to come back and work in the evening after the inspectors have all lazily gone home for the day ...or at least back to their respective troll-office caves to digitize their little forms or play with their little spreadsheets while keeping up with their friends' facebook pages in the background...   ...all so our guys can come back later and work into the evenings just because it's 'safe' to actually get work done w/out 'fear' of some b.s. inspector popping by to make sure their shoes are properly laced or their hats are firmly secured.  

I don't know if i have a point.    ... contradictorily, maybe more inspectors would mean even *less* deaths... ...but, then, that'd just scale the other industries down and make nuclear not look *as* awesome as it does compared to them.    but, then, could the coal or n.gas industry really afford to function with that level of 'refined safety standards' imposed actively?   I think it just goes to show all the clearer that *nothing* rivals the energy densities of nuclear feedstocks.  ...and all the more the political b.s. surrounding 'jobs' in the other sectors.  ....with the whole 'solar &amp; wind employ more than coal and n.gas' crap.  Nuclear probably employs the *least* amount of people... ...but provides the *most* amount of energy-per-person employed.  

Now *that'd* be an awesome graph comparison to see... ...granted, it probably wouldn't cast the nuclear industry in a very good light from a political / voters-for-jobs perspective but... then again, most people don't think about where their energy comes from to begin with, nor care... ..let alone the people employed by said industries.",2015-11-28 18:22:02+00:00,cxfwiex,5.0,t1_cxfuzwy,2602.0,NuclearPower

I still stick by what I said in those comments though ... in that, it's (speaking of 'boxes') 'black boxed' by the navy (again).  'Hopefully' that means it's receiving the funding that it deserves and is moving forward in such a way that it can 'be all that it can be' (in the navy?)... 

....at the same time, *if* they got it to work... not just to reach criticality but 'criticality &amp; beyond'... ....I seriously doubt it'd be something that even an experienced researcher could learn about, let alone be something that'd be announced on the evening news.

....meaning: rail guns.  not that 'standard' reactors like in supercarriers and subs couldn't provide the power for one... ....but, rail guns. ... rail guns and electromagnetic weapons. 

It isn't something that anyone but 'Snowden &amp; co' or 'Anonymous' would bring to the surface if that were the case... ...understandably so.

I suppose my point is, if i have a singular one... is that polywells are great, but they're just one of 'many' avenues towards achieving both fusion, and criticality within the fusion field.

...and ITER ties up funds researching that.

Hate to quote a movie but I feel Morgan Freeman's character in 'Chain Reaction' covered it best nearly 20 years ago... ....you introduce it to the world at a pace it can handle.    We've clearly become all the more entrenched in fossil fuels in the intervening decades (since the movie, at least) ... let alone the current 'trend' of 'renewables' ... ....to suddenly drop some 'endless' supply of energy into the global geopolitical equation... ..and, then, make it something that's 'assembly-lineable'.. ...geopolitics would change very quickly... ...and not necessarily in a very friendly way.

In short (to that line of ramble anyway): there are reasons to burying 'talent' (an overused phrase (by me) at this point) underneath a singular project ... like ITER... ....but, my guess is that 'they' are pretty good at this point at inventing things behind closed doors... ...and releasing them to the public at a pace that society can absorb (cellular &amp; computer technology being an example... ...shit's existed for decades in military circles, we get it and turn it into selfies and facebook posts... ....that's not to say that some/many of those posts aren't great to look at! :P )...

... but, yeah, Bussard definitely opened my eyes a *lot* more than they already were in that talk... ...as well, reinforced a lot of what I already had believed up to that point.   but, to hear a man like that speak.. ..and to explain *his* perception.. ...and to elaborate on his presence throughout the (very recent history of this) field was truly fascinating.  Google... and, more specifically, whomever at google was responsible for getting that organized and put together... ... should be commended for that.

If nothing else... if nothing 'technologically' was achieved by it... ...just to hear him come public in that way, and for that length of time.. ...really, honestly, is a great tribute to the last 60+ years of US (and global) physics. 

I've watched it multiple times over the near-decade since its come out and each time I not only take away something new, but am astounded by the complexity-yet-simplicity &amp; connectedness of the individuals involved in the field.  To become one of them... ....well, fast forward 50-100 years (and even farther), and, honestly, to *not* declassify what they were working on and to show their contribution to history &amp; the world would be a real shame.

ok... enough sentimentality...


LHC is a totally different 'thing' and for a totally different purpose.  and, like the HGP (Human Genome Project) before it, I think that ITER was intended to be the same... some 'futuristic carrot' to show the 'awe of the future' that was the 'late-'90's'  ... but then the world moved forward underneath it... the genome was sequenced 20 years sooner than initially planned... ...and, projects like ITER were put under pressure to do the same...

...esp as the shift to 'war' became a more primary focus..  *trillions* went into those.. 2+ from official numbers, and a redirection of capital that's many times that when ancillary costs are taken into consideration...

...and, well, as such... ...ITER.. or, more specifically, ITER's marketing had to shift from 'LHC/HGP = the future' to 'why is this costing so much and anticipating that it will take so long?

and, i think that's largely what the headline/article is responding to... and, personally? I wonder the same.  and, more so, my b.s. spewed at this point is to raise the question of 'why fund it to begin with?'...

granted, it's a long-winded seed to plant, and by no means the first or only one of its sort *to* be planted... but the point stands: this shit won't work even if it does work. It isn't a reactor ... it isn't a commercial design... hell, it's barely even a proof of concept... and, even if it *is* a 'proof of concept'.. it's a very early design of one at that... ...one that will take 'decades more' to achieve some sort of mass production...

...and it isn't a design-type nor science-type that caters to that.

that being said, personally? f' ITER.  It won't work anyway, and even if it does, it's so far out that... ....that it'll be at the expense of 'countless' lives.. or at least the *quality* of 'countless lives' who could benefit from greater supplies of energy... or at least greater availability of energy... that could come from greater supplies... 

I won't say it's 'criminal'... ...for those that exist as a subset of the project's administration, but... ...there is so much b.s. surrounding the 'politics' of this project that... that almost *is* criminal.

To dismount myself from my high horse standing atop a soap box...

sure, 100k years from now (ie, a million generations from now.. if a generation lives to be 100 to begin with)... ...it'll be an awesome accomplishment of man... ...if it works (and it won't work)... ... yet, so would soooo many things we could be investing in *versus* it... ...and, with the same funds.

but, back to the conceptual practicality that the vast majority can debate... ...or pass amongst themselves... [this wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion-fission_hybrid) caught my eye a few months ago and... ...*going* with Bussard's comments on the 'excess neutrons'... ...it's interesting..

...and, well, like it states in the intro section: 'the concept dates to the '50's and was strongly advocated by Hans Bethe during the '70's'

I feel like that singular sentence along bring credence to *both* the 'history' of this... ...as well to the idea of what can happen to talent &amp; brilliant minds... ...nearly 7 decades ago this idea originated... and 50 years ago a (singular) guy advocated for it.

...  ...all I can really say is 'thank god for CAD' because w/out it the abstract would be relegated to a few niche wikipedia articles and maybe a few websites linked to via /r/conspiracy...

ITER is a horrendous 'waste' of talent.  and any of that talent reading this could be well better off pursuing the private sector.. ..where at *least* they could be working on classified projects like Bussard's research is.. ...fame or at least credit may not be given in *their* lifetime, but at least 'history will remember'.. ...and there're plenty of history majors out there.. ...and, assuredly more to come once 'college is 'free''.

Have you considered the inroads we're making on other material-types that can harness energy from 'other sources'?  ([graphene](/r/graphene) for example).

&gt; Why not fund something that could be relevant in 100,000 years?

It won't work. Fusion will absolutely take place. Containment of the radiation-produced will make it uneconomically viable. 

&gt; Why not fund...

absolutely! /r/fusion. /r/nuclear ... there are 'plenty' of other projects out there to fund that this behemoth is tying up funds for researching... ...many that stand just as good a chance, many even *better* .. that are having their research dollars &amp; talent tied up because of the gargantuous size of capital needed to fund *this* thing.

There are other sources of power that could last just as long, if not longer. There are a lot more planets out there with resources that could be utilized that *don't* contain very much heavy water, or water to begin with.

1316,"&gt; I was thinking of an 'all electric' house

Yeah, unfortunately electric heat sucks though. I mean, technically 'heat is heat' but any electric furnaces or hot water heaters just tend to not work as well as gas fueled ones.   Never figured out what it is and I've put a few electric ones in our rental properties thinking it'd be... ...well, trying to 'test it out'.  The tenants always complain or at least are never fans.  ...and, when the power goes out they *definitely* get mad. (easily ignored for the most part as there's little to nothing I can nor will do about it but...)

I've never really understood *why* electric shit sucks so bad... I mean, electric ranges &amp; ovens obviously heat *more* than hot enough... and I've most definitely burned my mouth 'countless' times on overly-microwaved food....

The heating elements burn out. I've had to replace a few. Granted the maintenance issues/costs are about the same over the life of the units (gas vs electric) but it's still just 'what happens'.  

There was a Japanese unit I ran across a few years ago... ..it was an in-house waste gasification system... ... basically like a laundry drop deal of sort built in next to a broom closet or something...

they'd open it up, drop in 'whatever' and when it was full, or whenever they so desired, they'd turn it on and the unit would gasify the material... filter the toxins before emissions were exhausted out the roof... and they'd pull out the tray deal at the bottom and have a considerably lower quantity of actual trash to dispose of.

It also worked with fuel pellets and the like... ....and, with that, it provided both heat for the unit as *well* gas for their appliances... ...with the ability to hook up with a secondary unit that could burn the (syn)gas for electrical production... 

....but, the sites covering it were largely in Japanese, google-translate was doing a 'paltry' job on translating it.. ...and it was in Japan... ...so, getting the units over here would've been difficult enough in its own right, let alone cost both for the unit itself as well cost of maintenance and repair.. ...throw on difficulties with finding a contractor to install the unit... ...talking to these guys in english is difficult enough about doing shit they know how to do already is difficult enough... ...let alone installing a system they aren't familiar with.. ...let alone deciphering an installation instructions manual that's translated from Japanese...

...needless to say, 'great idea!' (imo), but... ...relatively 'impractical' *any*way... even if from a US and/or 'western' supplier... ...with local supply &amp; (tech) support...  ...I can't say that it's a 'novelty' item, but I don't imagine it has huge widespread adoption even in Japan.

... just like [GEK's gasifiers](http://www.allpowerlabs.com/) aren't exactly a commonly seen 'thing'... nor are [LEAF's](http://www.leafgenerator.com/).. and, nor [these guy's](http://www.superiorgasification.com/)..

I've actually contacted and spoken with each of their sales departments 3-4 years ago...   ...had a client who was 'all into this stuff' and we'd 'shoot the shit' for hours about it while we were building his house.  We put in a pretty large geothermal system, and the system I tracked down for him vs the one he initially approached us with was something like $15k cheaper *and* better than his system (more modern design, easier install, easier maintenance, better warranty, etc)... ....but he already had the loan-approval for the larger system (~$35k)... ...oh, i might add, that $15k cheaper was *after* he upgraded the system... ...it would've been $20k cheaper but when he realized the savings he put heated floors in several rooms in his house (kitchen, all the bathrooms, mudroom, and a few others) as well upgraded the 'power' of the system for the original areas/equipment he was addressing, etc... so, he 'went all out' needless to say).    ...it was a good thing we switched too. Where that house was (way up a hill, basically a cliffside view overlooking the river, etc... gorgeous lot, gorgeous house / house-placement)... ...when digging the trenches for the 'loop system' that ended up going in, we had to jackhammer the hell out of rocks to get them out of the way because digging around them was proving futile.  It really was a pain in the ass.. ...and, the system he was originally going with used deep geothermal install... it simply wouldn't've worked on that property anyway).

but... um... where was I..  ...yeah, so, he wanted 'other things' installed. Wanted to 'broaden' his 'off-grid' approach.  Battery deal, grid-tie, side generator, wired the house such that he could control the areas that were pulling from the batteries, generator, etc... ...so he could keep a tighter reign on what was going on... ....

anyway, the way we set it up was so that he has a gas diverter installed just after the xG&amp;E input coming into the house (ie, so he can hook up alternative/tanked gas... syngas, etc) as well put a plug in for him to install a generator of 'whatever' make and model he wanted to go with.... ....if he wanted a more-permanent unit, if he wanted to be able to quick-swap one out, etc.

Guy knew his shit and we did the best we could to accommodate him...  

but, that said, I spoke with GEK, ...shit, I can't remember the name of the one company I talked with... ...nor can I find their site.  ... anyway, none of those were the direction he/we wanted to go. It just didn't 'fit right' with the caliber of the house and its aesthetics. 

My point I guess is that... ... it 'isn't there' ... yet.  It isn't a 'science-tech' thing, it's simply a demand thing. I just don't think the market is big enough. Possibly a chicken &amp; egg scenario, but even with that, the cost of the units out there already isn't cheap...  ...and the cost of the construction and support of them isn't cheap I'd imagine..   

but, even with the other systems, part of the problem is... ...on the one hand 'great', you can use wood chips, yard shit, and, of course the preferred, pelletized biomass... ...but, they are full gasification units. They scoffed at the idea of being able to adjust their units for biochar production.. .. posturing themselves on the one hand that it would gum up the systems, that it wouldn't be as efficient, and on the other a near-complete dismissal of the whole 'biochar-production' approach to begin with.  In short, 'biochar' was 'beneath' them, as best I can put it.

At that, any energy produced would be carbon-neutral ... *at best*... and obviously carbon+ if wood pellets were sourced commercially.

It isn't that the idea doesn't hold, it's just that the economics and, more, the demand/market isn't there (yet? if ever?) on a wide-enough scale.  ...and, unless someone wants to pick it up (Musk-style) who can afford to hammer through the 'countless' design revisions necessary to engineer a product capable of it, I think it'll remain relegated to a niche. 

but... the possibilities behind it? great! imo.   I mean, a unit with national/international support and deployment that can be (relatively) easily installed and integrated into an already existing infrastructure... let alone new construction... and function on a very simple-to-run set of principals (load dishes into dishwasher, run unit, empty dishwasher and put away... ...load trash into trashcan, let fill up, take trash to street, replace bag, repeat...  ...load fuel-source into unit, let run, clean out, reload, repeat... ... replace filter to HVAC unit, take ~1 minute to inspect every month or so... go on with life) ... ...If it breaks, call the 1-800 number on the side of the unit or go to the website to find a list of local companies certified to work on the unit type ... ....it isn't too difficult.

If it produces biochar? great! carbon negativity!  ... simply toss it out into your yard, compost bin, garden, ...trash-even.   Pick up some wood pellets at Walmart, hardware store, have them delivered... ...hell, make your own... ..have tree crews dump off wood chips in your driveway for free.. ...you get the idea.

grid-tie for standard use and/or back-up, and/or when you quite simply don't feel like funking with it.   But, lots of various 'trends' have been installed in houses throughout the years... ...and, well, most have remained a novelty.  Many of them very deservedly-so.  ...oh.. also necessary would be certified units designed to work with the syngas produced, and/or, a secondary unit designed to 'step-up' the syngas to a nice methane-blend such that a non-certified unit would work with it.

But, getting various HVAC and hot water heater (and range/stove/oven.../grills) manufacturers to create a standardization and certification process behind it... ...and gasification unit manufacturers to create a unit-type that produces a gas-type that conforms to that certification step would... ...be really nice.

It's a 'novelty' either way. It will remain one most likely ... / unfortunately (to an extent).  It's simply easier to 'go with the flow' of 'the grid' than it is to deviate from it and deal with the associated hassles that come with it.   But it won't stop me from working with homebuyers /builders who have an interest in working with the unit-types..  ..within limits that I have the time &amp; desire to funk with it to begin with.",2015-11-22 19:38:23+00:00,cx99u1n,7.0,t1_cx97vqi,2985.0,TheGrid

&gt; Batteries for electricity, unless you get them for free

I don't think my neighbor got them for 'free' so much as he got them at 'cost' via his job...   ...and he (and the other guys that worked at his company) would throw them on the charge controller / battery tester deal to see how 'bad off' they were before making a decision to keep it or not.  ...

&gt; battery-energy for a single day should work

not here, man! When snowpocolypses hit, shit takes days to a week+ to get that shit fixed.... sometimes anyway. Depends on road &amp; weather conditions ... and the number of areas hit.  I think there were people that went w/out power for up to 3 weeks a couple of years ago.  ...obviously that's on the more extreme end of things but 2-3 days is almost an 'as-to-be-expected' deal.  Luckily most people have gas hot water heaters &amp; furnaces so it's a bit of a non-issue on the hot water heater / furnace side of things ... but at my old-old place I had a tankless hot water heater that was gas... ...but the onboard electronics were obviously electric and needed power for it to work... ...I'd run a line from my car's inverter to it before I finally got a generator and ran it that way. ...worked fine.

&gt; and a generator to daily charge them

*this* is where the diversity comes in...   *he* didn't want a generator and just went the battery route. for *his* cost of the cells, he could have nearly two days of batteries (at the usage levels he'd diminish down to when running on *just* batteries... and snow-covered solar panels)... for the cost of a decent generator.   Plus it was a bit of principal and pride in his case... ...it gave him 'bragging rights' during sales pitches. 



I think the main thing is that there's a lot of advancement going on in the field... ...and, though the science is pretty straight forward, the main thing will be creating user-friendly and 'cool' units that are both easily-accessible and easy to use... ...and, well, from there it will kinda-sorta take off.  I develop real estate.. I've installed a few units with battery grid-tie, solar, wind, and geothermal systems (not for electrical generation in the geothermal side, of course).... .....in ~a dozen houses over the past ~8 years.

The 'trick' to it is working with the electrician on the layout of the house. The nicest setups are when I can get the buyer to install a unit that allows them to plug the generator into their electrical box and go right from there.  I'm not a big fan of the n.gas-fueled they sell via H.Depot and Lowes... they're too expensive (in my opinion), and they're only designed to run in bursts.  granted, that's all that's needed during a blackout, but the reviews I've read are that they all just can't take the continued use...  and people don't want to mess with the maintenance of them.  I've had some clients get them installed, and I touch base with them when I see them out in their yards or run into them and ask how it's going.. remind them to maintenance them, etc ... but, they're just 'bloat' imo.

...and the systems that are much more hardened and designed to function on a more utilitarian basis are simply too expensive, usually too loud, and definitely too 'ugly' to put on the outside of a 5'500sq ft house... let alone *in* one when the cost per sq ft is what it's rising to be (again).



I see the Tesla power deal as being like the ipod... there were mp3 players before it, but it's what took it mainstream.  Marketing, easy of use, and 'bragging rights' have a lot of influence on the market... ...and knock offs are 'sure to come'.

I see the field progressing with a lot of potential. It's definitely *looooong* overdue, imo... because, again, it isn't like any of it is necessarily 'new' tech..  ..nor all that complicated when push comes to shove. These things certainly don't need oct-core core i7s to power their systems.  They aren't really a 'high demand' processing 'thing'... ...and pretty plastic cases have been around for quite some time now. Honestly, I don't know why it's taken someone *like* Tesla to do it *sooner*.  guess we'll see soon enough on how well it pans out though ",2015-11-22 18:12:58+00:00,cx96iv3,5.0,t1_cx950ik,2618.0,TheGrid

1321,"They do. I have a once-gorgeous tree in my front yard that got 'V'd' for powerlines. 

It's still a gorgeous tree and younger and very healthy... but it's a bit ugly. I've been debating cutting it down for a few years now just because of the unsightlyness of it...  ....but the rest of it is so pretty that... ...I haven't been able to bring myself to killing it based on aesthetics. 

Ice and ice-weight plays a major variable on lines as well... possibly even more so than trees to be honest with you.


I've lived in areas that have buried lines as well areas that have above-ground lines (obviously) and, I'll admit, the buried lines go through waaay less blackouts than the above-ground areas...


but, they still tie into above-ground lines and all it really means is that when those go out the entire buried line neighborhood tying into it goes out.  In my case, it meant ~50k people were w/out power until they fixed it.

It did/does look one helluva lot nicer though! I was thinking (and hoping) that all the line-laying advances that came with the fiber optic boom that the same tech could/would be modified to work with power lines as well, helping to reduce the costs of installation and maintenance... ...and, thus, more buried lines... ..but, like the article says, it's simply too expensive.  Unless there's a major reason to do it, and the city wants to make it a *point* to do it... ...to invest the money necessary for it to be afforded (unlikely)... ... it simply won't be done.  ...and, even then, there'd still be way more above ground lines than buried ones quite simply because, all in all, it isn't *that* big of a problem.

In my old house, my neighbor, a manager for a local solar panel sales firm, put panels on his house and enough batteries to keep himself running for something like 3 days even if the panels were covered in snow.

I forget the model/unit number he had, but he could scale up the amount of storage he had... ...so he'd just grab the old batteries from the customers and recondition them and keep them himself, so he is, for all i know, still adding *more* battery power to his setup. ... much of it had to do with swapping out *old* batteries with newer ones but he'd have his bursts where I'd help him carry in his newer ones and he'd just 'slap 'em right in' with the rest of them.

I suppose my point with that is, once the Tesla home battery deal comes out... (which I see as being the 'ipod/iphone' of units), 'countless' manufacturers will copy it and try to exploit the market-demand that it'll breed... ...(think androids basically).

Thorium (all but) *needs* uranium to work... or, at least, that's another 'assumed' in my mind ... that the general approach towards the utilization of thorium will come with uranium utilization being involved as well.

point is, *billions* of acres are used for farmland worldwide .. and there's nothing that says that switchgrass cultivation would need to be a US-only affair.  It isn't an invasive species and it's relatively easily tended to if it spreads outside the planted area... *if* it even does to begin with... as it's harvested before going to seed (seed production requires a lot of energy for a plant, and it 'robs' a lot of minerals from the soil in the process.  Letting a plant grow to seed makes sense when the 'seed' (and 'crop' around it) is what's intended... in the case of switchgrass it *isn't*)

anyway... it literally *builds* soil... so currently unarable land could be upconverted to arable land, while arable land could be upconverted to even *more* densely producing quality land (why do you think Iowa has such rich soil? and the midwest in general? it was largely switchgrass before it was tilled over... ...and, drought + lightening from oncoming storm = prairie grass fire... ...storm arrives, puts out fire = naturally produced biochar.  ie, the black rich soil of Iowa and the Ukraine? naturally produced biochar over tens of thousands of years if not longer

eventually literally burying deserts ... even sandy ones if so desired. ... esp if [irrigated](/r/irrigation) properly.

Russia, for example, produces 40% of its produce in backyard gardens... throw in some vertical garden skyscrapers or just more efficient use of rooftops and the such... and industrialize it behind centralized (and decentralized) business models ... and a helluva lot more than that could theoretically be grown... esp in the much more southern US latitudes.. ...even more so the more equatorial the area.

1326,"sure. why not?

Switchgrass is a self-seeding, broadcast seeded native perennial grass to much of North America. Advanced strains of [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass) are capable of sequestering [15 tonnes per acre per harvest](https://www.qdma.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=17469&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1262880942), with an average of 2.5 harvests per year (3 one year, 2 the next, 3 the next... etc).

That's over 35 tonnes per acre per year.

10b / 25 =  ~290m acres of switchgrass.  Switchgrass not only sequesters carbon (with &gt;50% by volume being convertible into biochar... so, ~600m acres to sequester the carbon on a 1:1... but this isn't needed and I'll get to why), it also is an energy source. It has a [higher eroei than corn](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/grass-makes-better-ethanol-than-corn/)... and that's a Jan 2008 article (the newer strains are higher... but also included in the above calculations)...

This means that we're not *only* sequestering carbon, but we'd also be producing energy... ...thus, offsetting the energy required from corn (it can produce ethanol as the article states, but also [syngas](/r/syngas) which can be used as a straight swap for [n.gas](/r/naturalgas) ... this is even easier &amp; faster than the [anaerobic digestion](/r/anaerobicdigestion) required to produce ethanol from it... ...and the electricity can be used to power both [the grid](/r/thegrid) as well charge [electric vehicles](/r/electricvehicles).

Take the [biochar](/r/biochar) and use its carbon as a feedstock for [graphene](/r/graphene) production and we now have a (ridiculously strong) building [material](/r/materials) which cuts down on the amount of [energy](/r/energy) required to move vehicles around to begin with... ...as well an [energy storage](/r/energystorage) material, as well its [solar](/r/solarenergy) &amp; other energy harvesting capabilities.

But, even 'better'.... arguably...  ....blend it in the [soil](/r/soil) and the biochar becomes just 1/3rd of the additional carbon sequestered because the biochar's there vs if it wasn't... ...both in increased [biomass](/r/biomass) growth, as well increased soil health and carbon sequestered via increased soil biota.

Not only that, the increased soil health and biochar water holding capacities means a reduction in [water](/r/water) needed (helping create more [drought](/r/drought) tolerance) due to the soil (and biochar) having an increased water holding capacity...

...and, where water holding capacity is increased, pollution due to runoff is decreased... thus, less unwanted [algae](/r/algae) overgrowth and all the ecological havoc that comes from that...

...and where runoff is decreased, there's an increase in fertilizer retention and, thus, less fertilizer needed... ...and, as such, less energy required to produce synthetic fertilizers.

The resulting increase in crop yields, in turn, mean an increase in food production, an decrease in the amount of land needed for food production (and, as such, more land available for switchgrass production... thus fuel &amp; biochar production... thus carbon sequestration)... ...and the potential for even *more* land to be allowed to be returned to its natural habitat...

...something that switchgrass itself caters very nicely to as it's a [native grass of North America](http://plants.usda.gov/maps/large/PA/PAVI2.png) thus wildlife is nicely evolved to not just exist within it but *thrive* within it.. ...its harvest cycles can also be timed to nicely coincide with breeding and nurturing cycles of local wildlife, and the increased soil health means very little of the crop will be effected by burrowing and ground creatures (ie, fertilizer-makers themselves).

Go farther, the *harvest* is 15 tonnes per harvest, ...ie, but the part that's harvested is ~4-6"" above the ground. It's roots grow at *least* 80% as deep as the grass grows tall... and, in many soil-types it grows deeper... with a flip-flop of percentages being the case (ie, 80% above ground the depth of the root structure *below* ground). [picture 1](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/2014raingardenpresentation-140401152921-phpapp02/95/raingarden-education-5-638.jpg?cb=1396366227) [picture 2](http://www.mass.gov/eea/images/czm/stormsmart/factsheets/3-7-425.png) It's roots themselves aren't just some 'weak part' of the plant, in fact they hold even *more* carbon than the above-ground portion of the grass itself [picture 3](http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/files/2015/10/Switchgrass.jpg), [picture 4](http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe70s/media/crops_0603.jpg)..

So it wouldn't be too much of a risk to say that the roots are equal to if not greater than the amount of carbon in the harvested (15 tonnes per acre per harvest) portion of the plant... ...and, *being* grasses (like *most* plants), 98%+ of the carbon in them is from 'inhaled' CO2.  meaning, the roots are also made from sequestered atmospheric carbon.

Once harvested, there is no longer enough 'green' to produce the photosynthesis necessary to supply the roots with the necessary energy they need (sugar) and, as such, they begin to die back. In an attempt to 'save itself', the plant chemically cauterizes the roots off at a sustainable level.  The ones that are strong enough will grow into their own plant. The rest of the roots will die, decay underground, and add to the SOC (soil organic carbon) of the field... farther increasing holding capacity of the soil, as well re-releasing the minerals in the roots into the soil for the next year.  Again, switchgrass is a perennial, so it will simply start growing back almost immediately after harvest once its adjusted to its new conditions.   If a portion of the biochar produced from each harvest is added back to the field, it will act like a sponge and help to hold this carbon there for much-much longer. Not to mention that the minerals released and carbon released into the soil from the decaying roots are fed upon by the microbes (fungi-included) in the soil... this will, in turn, sequester yet *more* carbon... and, well, you get the idea.

It's literally a positive feedback loop on multiple levels.  Switchgrass is also extremely drought tolerant itself, can grow in all *sorts* of soils you wouldn't *think* to put to plow, not only helping to breakdown rocks (ie, minerals) in the terrain, but also adding *inches* of soil above them per year.  A single plant can last 15+ years (with 2-10 being the 'sweet years' for harvest purposes) and, well, it's a self-seeding grass.. ...new generations will be taking root 'whenever' the farmer wants to let the crop to grow to seed before harvesting... ...the [harvesting process](http://evworld.com/images/switchgrassbale.jpg) uses standard and already widely available hay bailing/harvesting equipment ... and it works with standard pelletization and standardization (on energy density) so it can be (*is*) blended with or straight-swapped for [coal](/r/coal) for energy production there... ...ie, it fits extremely nicely with our already existing infrastructure..   Not to mention that the syngas is hydrogen rich so it actually burns *cleaner* than n.gas... ...and, well, could serve as an excellent feedstock for hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen ICEs.

(forgot to mention that *because* it grows on lands that don't easily cater to food production, it also wouldn't compete with food production)

At that, in the US, much of the land formerly used for agriculture is being returned to a more-natural state.  [Here's a chart](http://www.worldofcorn.com/#us-corn-acres-planted) that shows that in 2014 90,597 thousand acres (90.5m acres) were dedicated to corn (and soy on rotation).   And, according to 'World of Corn .com' [2.8 gallons of ethanol *can* be made per bushel of corn](http://www.worldofcorn.com/#one-bushel-of-corn-can-provide) ... with [an average of 171 bushels per acre](http://www.worldofcorn.com/#us-average-corn-yield) in 2014.

(in contrast, Algenol's [algae](/r/algae), though not carbon negative.. it ***does*** *necessitate* CO2 fertilization... which it gets from flue stack emissions... but, once the fuel is burned, it re-releases the carbon back into the atmosphere.. ...vs switchgrass being a carbon *negative* energy source... ...  ...*but*... in contrast, algenol's production capabilities are 9'800 gallons of ethanol per acre per year *plus* ~1500 gallons of 'mixed' hydrocarbons ranging from pure H2 all the way up to C20H42 (ie, diesel) ... and pretty much everything in between... minus the ethanol of course.    ....even switchgrass *pales* in comparison to this, but, again, switchgrass is carbon negative... and much easier to work with vs the largely on-concrete run-as-factories algenol facilities)

Much of corn grown goes to fuel production ... with much of the corn serving a dual purpose of food production too in the form of grain for livestock..  so there *is* some conflict here and the whole 'food vs fuel' debate comes back to life... but corn-fed livestock sucks, is unhealthy, and tastes no where near as good as grass fed and 'other' fed livestock. (insects, algae, etc can feed livestock &amp; humans ( /r/chlorella /r/spirulina sea kelp, etc).. and there's certainly no limitation of ocean for algae production)

and, again, the carbon sequestration via switchgrass *is* an energy producer / offsetter of carbon+ fuels currently used... while being a straight-swap for many of them in the already-existing current infrastructure.

In short: yeah. 10billion tonnes worth.. esp when you take into consideration that deserts can be reclaimed &amp; converted, soil is literally *built* atop shit land, and water use is drastically reduced for switchgrass (again, look at the map, it grows 'all over' ...including the Saharan &amp; Gobi.. on top of the S.West US)

We could theoretically sequester more than *that* if we so wanted to.. ...to the point that in a very short time (2025-2035 to 2050 on a far reach) we could run a carbon- economy.

*Totallllly* different subject altogether. I'll direct you to /r/conspiracy for 'answers' to that one

&gt; These designs have nothing to do with Thorium. 

Maybe a better way to word it (since we're finding better ways to readjust one other's points): These designs aren't entirely dependent on Thorium.

&gt; They work with any fertile material.

Including 'waste'.. a very here &amp; now real world 'problem'  ...thereby reducing the quantity of it. Does ITER do this?

&gt; Thorium is not so much more abundant that Uranium to provide any economic advantage considering how cheap nuclear fuel is in general.

Yet, there's already plenty of uranium already mined (and thorium)... ... and, debatably rare earths as well... ...yet, one of the major limitations to mining rare earths in the US is that it's essentially 'imposible' to mine them w/*out* amassing *huge* quantities of thorium in the process. To treat thorium as a fuel source (and, thus, to have reactor designs that allow thorium to be processed *as* a fuel source) not only gives 'us' a whole lot more availability to 'rare' earths, but also something to do with all the thorium dug up in the process...  ....vs fossil fuels? I see this as a win-win-+ situation.

&gt; So is Uranium that hasn't been enriched. 

..and it serves as a feedstock for these reactor designs as well! Crazy how that works.

&gt; 99% of Uranium is considered waste

I know. Ridiculous isn't it?

&gt; the Uranium at Paducah alone could power 100 reactors for 100+ years no problem

Had drinks just this week with a friend who's worked at the Paducah facility for &gt;10 years now as an inventory 'specialist' who ensures that everything is &amp; remains what's stated on the records.

&gt; 100+ years no problem

probably longer.. imagine what could happen if the 'bottom' 2 billion energy consumers had access to the energy from that what we could accomplish as a civilization. ... esp when contrasted with what we've al*ready* accomplished with the energy utilized thus far... 

&gt; Why switch to Thorium when Uranium is already so cheap, abundant and well understood?

This reminds me of that scene in 'Blood Diamond' when Jenny's character asks Leos 'There are thousands of people suffering &amp; dying all around us, why should I help this one?'  (misquoted because I don't have the exact lines in front of me, but the effect is the same).       .... ..... (she then says aloud, 'I can't believe I just said that')

so... to requote....

&gt; Why switch to Thorium when Uranium is already so cheap, abundant and well understood?

Because there's already *sooo* much thorium already mined and concentrated. Because there's sooooo much more thorium that could be mined as we get to the rare earths and other deposits we 'need' to function as a civilization.

or, looked at another way...

&gt; Why switch to Thorium when Uranium is already so cheap, abundant and well understood?

for the same reason we are spending *billions* backing ITER.  

or

Then why invest billions with 'hopes &amp; dreams' of switching to ITER-style fusion?

1331,"&gt; From a global perspective the amount of money being spent on ITER is a nearly invisible drop in the bucket.

If money was so plentiful, people wouldn't work so hard to get it.
If the money was so plentiful, it wouldn't be as difficult as it is getting projects funded.

It may be a proverbial 'small drop' in a 'very big bucket' but it's a healthy percentage of the money being invested towards advanced research projects. ...that could otherwise be invested elsewhere..  ...towards *more* research projects ... ...that cost *less* money each..  ...and advance science much farther than just down these limited lines.

&gt; And what do you think spending the same amount on Thorium will do?

I think spending the *same* amount on thorium would be a completely inefficient allocation of capital towards thorium. Meaning: I think it would take *much* ***less*** money towards thorium... ...

&gt; Get you one thorium powered reactor is all. 

off of much less capital, yes. and also get the various LFTR designs off the drawing boards and into proof of concept constructed designs that could then advance the science and begin the industry necessary towards building many many more.   ...and well within the cost of what ITER's price tag.

&gt; How does that solve anything?

how does ITER '*solve*' anything? It actually 'solves' a lot. It works out what directions are better than others. Which directions are 'dead ends' or simply not viable approaches from a commercial perspective.

&gt; The technology for thorium isn't an issue

I beg to differ. There are a 'lot' of design approaches bounced around for thorium reactors, LFTRs being just one. There will need to be technologies invented, or, more, approaches engineered to implement those various design-types. 

&gt; only the economics are

by &amp; large this is true... and much of the potential money behind those economics are tied up towards research projects like ITER that, quite simply, won't work as well and won't be as quick to market.   ...and, 'quicker to market' means that more people can benefit faster than from ITER.

&gt; There is no advantage to using Thorium so why would we?

How do you figure there's no advantage? Thorium as a fuel source is extremely abundant, non-weapons grade, and otherwise currently considered a 'waste' product as it currently sits. The ability to turn 'waste' into fuel will *always* have at least *some* advantage in it... ...unless you think Sweden's waste incineration programs aren't economically viable?",2015-11-21 20:33:05+00:00,cx8ala4,7.0,t1_cx89z79,1046.0,energy
1332,"&gt; we don't even know exist yet

some we probably haven't even created yet.


I've read many many books about ITER, I understand the objectives and I 'get' the goals.

I'm still not a fan of it. I think it's a *huge* cost of money and it ties up 'countless' quantities of talent and diverts *both* from projects that could be more fruitful... 

read: I'm a fan of thorium.    and, from the perspective of *both* energy production *and* dealing with nuclear waste, I find its potential to *far* outweigh that of any that ITER will likely ever address.

It won't work. If nothing else, [take Bussard's word for it](https://youtu.be/rk6z1vP4Eo8)   .... it's been a few months since I last watch that video so I can't point out the specific m:s point to hear his remarks about it but... in short, it won't work.   at least not from an economic perspective.

The neutrons will build up too quickly to safely contain. The system will have to be shut down until they're absorbed. and it will then have to be restarted again (at great expense)... to ever be economically viable.

From a 'science experiment' perspective? great. But it's tying up ['countless' billions](http://news.sciencemag.org/funding/2014/04/cost-skyrockets-united-states-share-iter-fusion-project) and tens of thousands (way more probably) in *extremely* talented man hours to achieve something that's already known to be non-economically viable from the perpsective of powerplant design.

There are literally *millions* of different projects that could be funded with the same money and employ even *more* 'talent' (physicists, engineers, scientists, researchers, construction workers, industry, etc etc etc) than what this 'hog' is taking up.

I'm not saying to abandon it... esp not at this point, it's a monstrosity that has way too much money already invested in it to stop it at this point.... might as well finish it off...

...but, then again, maybe we *should* just nip it in the bud, cut our losses, and diversify the remaining funds towards other projects.

The biggest problem I have with it is that from a PR perspective, the average person sees it as 'the answer to all the world's energy problems'.. and this is evidenced by 'countless' movies over the past 15-20 years+ pushing fusion as 'the end all be all' of all of humanities everythings (wars, poverty, resource limitations, etc)

Meanwhile, literally 1/100th that amount would propel thorium research way-the-hell-forward, if not be enough to build an actual viable power plant that can then be 'tweaked' in future designs and scaled out much larger, much faster, and deployed many more places (all over the world really).  ITER won't even be a power plant, it'll just be proof of concept, ... there'll then be decades of research needed to turn the science-learned into a power plant... ..that, again, won't work from an economic perspective anyway.  even in a fission-fusion hybrid design.

It's a joke. ...and, in my opinion, an intentional conspiracy. Way too many careers will start and end on that project, or have some of their best years tied up chasing after it and buried underneath it's bureaucracy.

I gotta admit though, the first/sole comment to the article made sense to me... ...why use water when there are denser-than-water materials that could just as easily be used.  May help to make the project cheaper and/or have a smaller footprint.

Back of the envelope example: modifying what the comment says, what if the water is pumped during the 'store energy' step, but pushes up a heaver-than-water 'weight' near the top.   when the system is run in reverse, the weight is allowed to increase the pressure of the water beneath it and... ... turn the turbine.

This design uses the weight of the water itself to be its own pressure but, I feel this is limited.

&gt; Citations were issued, and Harrington pleaded guilty to several violations. He was assessed a nominal fine and ordered to drain the three reservoirs, which he did. However, Harrington again closed the headgates in 2004 and refilled the reservoirs. As a result, OWRD and the Oregon State Police submitted reports to the Jackson County District Attorney's Office alleging additional violations of Oregon water law. That office filed misdemeanor charges against Harrington, and in 2008 he pled guilty to one count. He was issued another fine, placed on one year probation, and was again ordered to drain the reservoirs.

and

&gt; Harrington has been repeatedly convicted over an 11-year span for illegally storing water on his Crowfoot Road property without a permit. He even pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2008, but he refuses to drain the ponds as ordered by the court, Mejia said.

""Most people, when caught in a criminal act, at least promise not to do the act again,"" Mejia said, adding Harrington was ""willfully in violation of the orders of the court.""

1376,"&gt;  Radiation spreads indefinitely.

and it dilutes just as 'indefinitely' as well. 

&gt; That level of fault tolerance is impossible to achieve, nuclear is and always will be inherently unsafe.

but it can be made much, much safer.  Check out [this post-link/vid](https://www.reddit.com/r/thorium/comments/3t2t5f/modular_thorium_reactor/) for approaching nuclear in a different way.   Not only does it produce compounds needed by industry (fuel for nuclear batteries, medical contrast, cancer treatments, etc), it also 'consumes' much of the radiation produced by most of today's reactor designs, lessening the amount of material needed to be transported safely, stored safely, and overall 'dealt with' in general.

...not to mention that it not only *doesn't* produce weapons grade material, but it *consumes* it in such a way that there's actually *less* of it around than there already *is*.  Remember, if it's radioactive, it's emitting harnessable energy. The more radioactive? the shorter-lived, and the more harnessable energy. The less radioactive, the less a threat and the less energy density and/or valuable energy *to* harness.  On top of that, it converts the large number of weapons grade material, as well a very large number of already-stored radioactive material (waste-included) into a fuel source... ...and, one that even if not run in 'breeder mode', that would supply humanity with thousands of years of energy even if *every*one were consuming at western rates... even US-rates.   Run the reactors in 'breeder mode' and there's even *more* material with even *longer* reserves of energy.

I'm not arguing for nor promoting Fukushima, Chernobyl, or TMI-style reactors. I don't believe *any*one is.. ..at least not anyone that's pro-nuclear with half a brain.  On top of that, I'm of the opinion that all reactors running on those designs should be shut down and safely dismantled and dealt with. I agree with you that it's inherently dangerous to continue to run them.  Luckily countries like Germany, the UK, etc are already doing this.

But, the nuclear genie is out of the bottle, has been for the better part of a century. This material *does* exist, and it clearly isn't going anywhere unless we make an active effort to do something with it. All the overlapping redundancy in safety systems in the world can't make the current storage sites 100% safe (nothing can), but through proper structure, maintenance and implementation of progressive approaches they can be made much much safer, and in such a way that not only farther reduces their dangers, but does so *while* extracting the untapped energy from them... ...and, somewhat ironically, *by* tapping their remaining energy.  Leaving them sitting there isn't the solution. ...and, honestly, at this point, *not* utilizing them doesn't reduce the problem either.

You're literally promoting a dangerous stance to the situation and one that reinforces the entrenchment that leaves the stuff lying around and, thus, increasing the likelihood that someday something bad *will* happen.

&gt; That level of fault tolerance is impossible to achieve

In anything. I've been burned by more solar thermal concentrators, cut by more broken solar panels, hit by more turbine blades, and tripped into more geothermal ditches, and gotten wet and nearly drowned from more hydroelectric stations than I've ever been damaged by radiation from a nuclear power plant (at least that I'm aware of). ... and yet I'll still continue to interact with those systems as often as the situation necessitates or even allows.  The same goes even farther when including fossil fuels... ..I've inhaled more coal particulates (including radiation), burned myself on more petro-powered engines, inhaled more leaked n.gas, inhaled more gasoline &amp; diesel fumes, and breathed in more CO from dysfunctioning furnaces, gas stoves, and old water heaters than I've ever had harm caused by nuclear power plants (again, that I'm aware of).

I refuse to live my life in the fear of some potential disaster that may never happen, and has been best-prepared for if *to* happen as the politics and economics of the situation allow for (obviously this one's *way* open for debate).  ...and, even with those reactor designs never having caused me harm (that I'm aware of), I am still not arguing for them.. and think that, by &amp; large, they *should* be shut down.... ....and transitioned over to reactor designs that are inherently much safer, much more efficient, and much less likely to cause problems... ..with the added benefit of reducing many of the problems that are already out there relating to both them and other energy sources &amp; systems (solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass-included).

...if so fearful of radiation, what do you suggest we do with all the radiation already in the natural environment?  I think [u/4ray said is best](https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/3t5106/fracking_produces_more_radioactive_waste_than/cx3uxij) yesterday.

There's a certain degree of specificity and, arguably, specialization to each sub... ... it doesn't put it out there in people's faces, but it's made available for users to follow *if* they want to.

If reddit had a problem with new subs being created why would they make it so relatively easy to do??

&gt; Laying claim to those subreddits allows them to be used later if they become more popular, or to 'power-up' other subreddits via the following two trend points...

Well, if the internet is like the wild west, and reddit is one of the most open platforms on the internet... so, kinda-sorta the 'wild west of the wild west' if you will... ...*wouldn't* there be some sort of 'claiming' going on?? 

but, at that, part of my intention behind it is also that I take a very *open* approach to moderating. I feel that a community will, by &amp; large, moderate itself.  The upvoting, downvoting, reporting, etc functions are caked right into reddit.  If users don't like a post, or a series of post-types... ...they'll usually let the poster know it..  ...they'll downvote it, ask questions, take a posture and tone that otherwise... ...promotes the community of the sub to regulate itself.

I'm also of the opinion that a lot of mods are a bit *too* heavy-handed on their approach towards moderation. It's 'their sub'.. ..let them be. Who am I to tell them how to manage their own sub??  If I have a problem with it, clearly I can, have, do, will, and 'whatever else' my own sub.  I have blocked very few people *across* the '127' subs I mod (is it really 127?? Did you freakin' count it?? *I* don't even know how many damn subs I mod!!) ... I don't like blocking people. I feel its unnecessary. Shy of the 'sockpuppet' accounts created *for* the spam you talk about / accuse me of... well, yeah, I've blocked a few of those.  Luckily these days I don't even have to. Anenome5's skills, talents, and implementations put a stop to that b.s. quite effectively.  ...something I've commended him on and thanked him for multiple times.. ..and have every intention of continuing to do so if the need and situation arises for it.

&gt; allows them to be used later if they become more popular, or to 'power-up' other subreddits via the following two trend points...

ha! 'if' being the keyword there!  I'm not sure of very many subs I'm involved with becoming all that much more popular just because I'm involved with them. is there a 'powering-up' that can happen? sure.  If there're a lot of a certain article/post-focus and I feel it merits its own sub... ...yeah, I'll create a sub for it and attempt to direct traffic there.  It's the internet. It's the 'digital reality' of things... ...there're essentially an 'unlimited' number of options... or, well, x^y relative to the character &amp; character-number limitations reddit puts on its subs names/titles anyway.

Honestly? if a sub I posted to pretty often *did* get too big... ...and more or less took on a life of its own, I'd probably create a new sub to direct attention to... ...posting 'better' articles to those older subs, but the more 'froth-like' articles of lesser 'nutritional density' to the newly created subs.. ..if for no other reason than out of a preference to *not* bug the hell out of that community... ..and an attempt to *not* disrupt the life it'd taken on. It'd be 'rude' of me to do so honestly, and easy enough for me to *not* do so at the same time.

&gt; Moderator, creator, or primary/sole poster of hyper-niche subreddits for 'long tail' search terms such as /r/pyrolosis, /r/AnaerobicDigestion, /r/Gasification, and /r/BioChar. By posting fresh content on a monthly basis or more, Google is more likely to rank such pages higher, especially since niche terms tend to face much less competition. 

I feel like I've addressed the main idea behind this point... ...the 'fresh content' aspect has to deal with... ...well, 1) when the content comes in to me and 2) when I get around to focusing on the content.  I compartmentalize my news sources... ...filters, feeds, groups, etc.   Sometimes I may let them 'build up a while' before coming back to them and focusing on them in a more singular mindset.   Sometimes things happen in waves, others are easier to keep up with regularly.  ...others are *best* kept up with *ir*regularly.  It really just depends on what it is... ...and, hell, some of these 'hyper niche' topics are *so* 'hyper-niche' that there really *isn't* a lot of information published on them on a regular basis *to begin with*.  

on the rest of it... I really have *no* idea how to do any of that google sneaker page ranking bullshit.  nor do i need to. *nothing* about what I do necessitates it... nor would really benefit *from* it.  ...and, not to say there isn't money in it, clearly Google wouldn't be in business if there weren't.. ..or at least to the same level &amp; degree that they are.. ..but, I don't need to make money that way, nor am I necessarily convinced that I'd want to.

'Marketing' isn't my focus. Sure I have marketing 'ideas' but... ...again, for my business it simply isn't necessary and any that I have I pass on down to people that *do* know how to do all that stuff.  Me? I can't even figure out how to filter sockpuppet accounts on reddit... ....let alone how to manipulate Google adsense to promote something that was already promoted to me, hence why I most likely even ran across it to begin with.

&gt; Many, many of said niche subreddits are linked into each other, forming a link-web that has sufficient out of network links 

feel I've covered this part of it already...

&gt; to avoid triggering an instant Google search penalty

and this part in my clearly stated ignorance on the subject.  ...someone talking about IQ on one part and then knocking theirs by stating that they *don't* know how to do something should be sufficient reason enough to show how little I care to really ... ...I don't know how to do it. I don't care to know how to do it (really). Understanding a general idea of the concept be a 101-level of understanding that it exists, roughly *how* it exists, and roughly how it influences me (and others) is completely different from doing it as a job and implementing it on an active level.

It actually *bugs* me when I search for things and a reddit post pops up in my search results... ..esp when it shows up to be a post that *I* posted about the topic! means I have to scroll past it and oftentimes to the next page to find out the data about the 'thing' that I'm looking for.

&gt; Step one is to shop articles focusing on a client around until they can be posted 

that sounds like a pretty good idea.. ..but, how would anyone make any money at that? and do people even care about reddit enough in that way for there to be an actual market for it??   If so, I can assure you its most definitely *not* on the &gt;1k subscriber-count subs that I mod! ...and, if a sub got 'taken over' by that kind of shit, clearly I'd most likely do what I show an affinity *to* do.. ..create a new sub to get away from it.

&gt;  is extremely abnormal for most personal reddit accounts. 

again, I'm not most personal reddit accounts. nor am I the average reddit user. ....but, oddball that I may be, I still don't do any of the shit you're accusing me of doing... ...not only because I don't know how to (nor have no real desire *to* know how to)... ...but also because that shit sounds like it'd be really.fucking.annoying.   ...hence why i try to stick to my little side-subs that I created, more often than not anyway.

&gt; Fewer than one in 1,000 (possibly fewer than one in 10,000) redditors would show a similar pattern of usage.

I think the last doctor who tested me put me in something like the 9x'th percentile for certain things.  Not sure [how many redditors there are](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/reddit-stats/) but I wouldn't've been invited to /r/top if I was the average user. :)

Apologies if the shit I post annoys you.. ..but, looking at your profile (with *way* less scrutiny than you clearly just *studied* mine), maybe if you contributed a bit more than your completely incorrect accusatory theories and average 5-10 sentence comments I could get a general idea of what you *are* into and may actually learn something.. ...vs reading your nicely formatted comments that are *clearly* slanted towards what you know vs having a slightly more open mind.  You accuse me of being relatively systemic and agenda-focused.. ..almost like an algorithm or bot or some such shit but, man, glancing over yours I gotta suggest 'think outside the box a bit!' It isn't the philosophical newage b.s. 'rhymed' about at the beginning of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfNluQ888g4) but the advice holds... and applies.

I've seriously interacted with robots that are less to script (err... kinda).

.... as well, may actually post some shit you *do* find interesting.. ..regardless of whether it's the product of some SEO feedback loop I'm caught up in... ..or not.

Whoa! That was a helluva response man! Let me see how to best address it...

&gt; Mass crossposting of the same articles to numerous low-readership subreddits.

It's obviously x-posting, but I see it more in function as a sort of #hashtagging. Different sub/rs have different angles on the same information, comment on it accordingly, and have use for it for different applications.

Example: post an article to /r/environment and you'll generally get an environmentalist's perspective on it. Post the same to /r/water and there may be a more technical approach. Post it to /r/climatechange and the largely 'climate-skeptic' tone of that sub will 'tear it apart' vs 'buy into it'.   I don't know about you but I clearly spend more of my time posting articles and reading comments than typing comments and... ...*not* posting articles.   Why? Because *I* know what *I* think about an article, but other people weighing in on it not only gives me insights as to what others think &amp; feel about it, and oftentimes from perspectives or angles that I hadn't thought of. It's 'useful' to me, and hopefully useful to others.  

Another angle on that is that, ...and this will partially address the 'many many of said niche subreddits are linked into each other' point... ...I've been on reddit for the better part of a decade. I *still* learn about sub/rs that I didn't know existed... ...be it via people x-posting to them, linking to them in their comments, or the 'other discussions' link at the top of each post.   ....this aspect of reddit somewhat annoys me and so I decided to create a format that made it readily easy for people not just to learn about other subs that they may not've known existed, as well to navigate between them easily enough..  ..I use this feature myself quite often and, as such, make it a point to 'cake it into' the sidebar of the vast majority of subs I mod.. ...linking not just to other subs that I mod, but other subs across reddit that I may not even frequent that often but believe that others may find useful for their particular purposes or interests. Thus, it serves both a selfish as well a hopefully-helpful purpose.

&gt; High-readership subreddits, especially those with active moderators, tend to use subreddit bans to discourage such behavior.

Those tools are *well* over my head. I usually leave it to anenome5 to implement any such things as I have *no* clue how to do it nor any real desire to learn how. ...esp when he's so damn good at it!

That said, I really don't know *what* high-readership subreddits have going on behind the scenes, nor am I sure I'd really understand it even if I did.  

*That* said... I like the broader-focused subs. They're a great place to get a 'general pulse' on things, great information/articles/posts, and the general places most people weigh in on.   Sometimes their focus is a bit *too* broad for my preference... ...and I find that posting an article to a sub with a greater refinement in focus stands a chance of getting someone with more expertise to weigh in on a topic.    So, for example, posting a thorium focused article to /r/energy vs /r/nuclear vs /r/thorium... ..each step seems to lead to a more specific set of responses to it.   The more simplistic and generalized comments getting 'weeded out' in the process.  ...and, when a good discussion gets going on something? I more often learn *more* from *that* than I *ever* could've via the article itself.

I feel like my motives behind this has been sufficiently covered.. ..moving on...

&gt; Vast majority of content, particularly beyond this week, is either the above mass cross-posted articles or single-line comments with additional search terms as another link to the same article. 

I don't really understand what you mean by this.  That I post shit that's &gt;1 week old?  Sure. Yeah, of course. It depends on what my focus is at the time, and unfortunately things aren't written about every.single.day. that it's always 'freshly covered'. ...nor does it need to be. Also, some of the things are *better* written about and covered *years* ago... ***decades*** in some cases. ...with what's come after it oftentimes largely *stemming* from ideas put forth in those older ones, or at least building off of them.

In other cases, I may've just been 'a bit behind' on the news, my emails, or various other streams of content.  If mods in subs have problems with the date of the content posted, they usually say something and I readjust accordingly. Other subs/mods really don't seem to mind, nor users.  I suppose it's really just relative to each post's specific situation.

&gt; Single-line link-only comments that point to the article linked by the parent post do absolutely nothing in terms of notifying people of interesting content (the post does that), but can help boost the article's search ranking.

I'm guessing you mean when I post a link to a more-easily read article then post a link to the paper underneath it??  *Lots* of times if *I* don't include the link *others* will post it... ...if it's something that I can easily do or something that generated enough interest for me to seek out the actual paper, I tend to go ahead and include both.  Many journals do the same. Nature, for example, will include a 'user friendly' version as well a link to the paper itself. It 'enhances' understanding, imo.  Others seem to not have a problem with it?

Ultimately, I suppose I'm going to have to say that I disagree. I *do* think that they do something. I feel that they help users dig deeper into a subject if they want to... ..and, easily enough that if they were curious for more but no *so* curious to do the research themselves, providing the link for them may be the 'thing' that *has* them delve into it... vs not.  Again, it isn't with any ill-intent. ...and I'm of the opinion that the more people know about something, the better any conversations about it can be more easily had.  

&gt; Up to 119 posts per day, multiple standard deviations beyond typical reddit user.

I read a lot, have a lot of interests, and have a set of daily obligations that, quite simply, allow me to feed these interests and curiosities... ...profit from them even, but certainly not in the way you're suggesting.  Also, time spent on the phone waiting on hold or listening to someone drone on about things I could do with my eyes closed and in near-comatose levels of sleep all but *necessitates* that I find other things to occupy my mind.  ...if I feel it's 'worthwhile'? I post it.  Really not a whole lot of mystery behind that.    As far as the 'typical reddit user' is concerned? I can't speak for them as clearly I'm not them, nor am I one.  I can say this: the average IQ is 100. Mine is a little bit higher than that. Combine that with the 'daily exercise' of keeping up with many of the topics relating to what I commonly post about... ...a lot of it is simply 'second nature' at this point.  It's simply following an evolution of the topics.  So, IQ may not come into play at all. I could be a complete idiot and just have kept up with much of this for so long it's... ...again, second nature to me.   This isn't intended to pass judgement on anyone *with* an IQ of ~100, nor the average reddit user.. ..it's simply to point out the fact that clearly I'm not.. ..or agree with *you* having pointed that out at least.

&gt; Very little actual interaction with other redditors. Average of 5-8 link karma and just barely over 1 comment karma per submission. 

I interact with other redditors. I'd say 99% of my interaction is done via pm's.. ..or something very close to that.  

I also tend to type a lot when I *do* interact... ...that shit takes a while to do.  Clearly you've studied my posting history thoroughly-enough to see that when I *do* comment it tends to be longer than shorter.  I've never been known for brevity.  

&gt; Lots of posting, not a lot of people giving positive feedback, yet even without evidence of interest from other redditors, often without any engagement whatsoever, 

maybe people don't like what I post? Maybe people (like you) see that I post so often that they assume that I don't really need the reinforcement of an upvote to continue *to* post? I don't post for karma. I don't know what to do with the karma I have, let alone lots more of it.  They don't tend to downvote it too often either. Maybe they just don't find it interesting enough to go through the extra step *of* voting on it to begin with?

I don't know, I really can't speak for what other people do or don't do... ... I'm not them.

&gt; this account continues to post in the same pattern.

I have the same interests? I generally get information from the same sources? I have a 'daily routine'? I don't know. ???

&gt; Moderator (and creator) of 127 subreddits, most in the 0-1000 reader range. Laying claim to those subreddits allows them to be used later if they become more popular, or to 'power-up' other subreddits via the following two trend points...

Isn't it better to create a sub/r that no one else has cared enough to create and 'bug' *it* with my methods vs bug the more general public with it??  I mean, if no one else has cared to... or has cared to but otherwise abandoned or not-pushed-to-reach-a-fuller-potential ... ...does it not make sense *to* create it??  I've never understood this whole 'stick to the subs that exist' mentality.  Sure it's one thing if there were 'countless' subs all about the same thing... ...say a /r/wastewater, a /r/wastewater1, a /r/wastewater2, /r/wastewater3, etc etc... ...that'd be one thing, but there isn't.",2015-11-18 06:28:28+00:00,cx49v0r,5.0,t1_cx46d5m,7978.0,Wastewater
1382,"I don't have the links readily in my mind, believe I've posted them to /r/iodide before though...

...there's a list/breakdown that gets into the quantity &amp; time of exposure *per* quantity of iodine vs multiple different strains.... bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, etc.

To oversimplify it, iodine pretty much kills all single celled organisms... ...destroys viruses, kills viral infected cells, and breaks up and kills fungal cells.... ...so, if the fungi are individual cells, even easier. If they're 'joined together' (such as pseudohyphae, hyphae, yeasts, etc) it will kill individual cells within the larger super-organism and... ... potentially the entire superorganism if given enough time and in sufficient quantity.

Next up with that... ...every human cell needs iodine.. ...in one form or another (iodine, iodide, both) and in one concentration or another... ...just depends on cell-type.

Think how fluoride &amp; chlorine (two of the other halogens) mix with tap water... ...iodine &amp; iodide do as well.  Granted iodine atoms are a good deal *larger* than fluorine &amp; chlorine atoms, and iodine serves a different purpose &amp; function in the body than those... ...though there's definite overlap and even oftentimes because iodine/iodide levels are too low in most people (like 98%+), the body will use fluorine/fluoride, chlorine/chloride or bromine/bromide as a botch-job substitute for the task....


.... that said, as the iodine levels build (say, from iodine loading), *like* with the other halogens, the 'water' in the body will contain iodine &amp; iodide much like it already does fluoride &amp; chlorine.

Iodine being *much* more lethal to single celled organisms than even chlorine, (and fluoride not so much at all really, definitely not in comparison to the other two at least), it essentially is 'everywhere' in such that it can kill infections.

Maybe not an entire infection... ...as in, it may not get to every.single.organism. infecting the host (eg a human), but it can &amp; will drastically reduce the active count inside the body that the effects are lessened, if not noticed at all.

It also stands the chance *of* killing off all of the infecting organisms.   ...or, at least, reducing the count enough such that the body's immune system can mop up what's left.


The nebulizing / vaporizing does two things... first it literally just gets the iodine into the lungs and onto the surface of them.  ...akin to applying iodine to a skin infection.   This will help to kill off surface infections within the lung... ...as well, as the iodine lands on the tissues, it will 'soak in' much like it does on skin... ..or, much like a drop of 'anything' (water, iodine, rubbing alcohol,... ...orange juice, 'whatever') does on paper.

This will not only help to kill off surface infection within the lungs, not only help to kill off sub-surface infections within the lungs, but also eventually load the iodine into the circulatory system of the lungs before moving onto the circulatory system at large.

Second, the iodine will be absorbed through the lungs and directly into the circulatory system... ...to then get 'wherever' around the body from there... ...including back into the lungs' circulatory system itself. ... ..to then load up the lungs from the tissue&gt;out to the surface of the lungs..

again, an over generalization but a good rule of thumb is to think of iodine as being like fluoride &amp; chlorine in tap water... ...'everywhere &amp; not-easily removed'.

So, to apply this directly to TB... ... or *any* lung infection of a bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal level... ...I think you can get the general idea.

The body also *needs* iodine... ...and, like most things the body needs, it has a very evolved set of functions that allow the body to handle and manipulate it.

There is no 'iodine toxicity' as is commonly put forth by the horribly undereducated medical community. If you'd like more information on it (and I recommend *every*one look into it), check out ... well, first, check out /r/iodide, but then check out Dr Flechas, Dr Brownstein, Dr Sircus (to an extent), and others...

I believe Dr Sircus has 'instructions' on how to nebulize iodine, and  recommendations as to which forms to use... ... in his case? the type he sells on his site (nascent iodine).  ...which, in his defense, *is* a good product... ..though, *of* the 'nascent iodines', I think that X2 Survival Shield is a higher quality product... ..and it definitely has a higher mcg-count.

Both are paltry in comparison to Lugol's though.. with Nascent Iodine having ~400mcg per drop, X2 having ~650mcg per drop, and 2% Lugol's having 2.5mg per drop (broken down as 1mg iodine + 1.5mg iodide)... ...with higher concentrations being, well, obviously higher.. ..at that ratio though.

Other forms of iodine... ..liquid anyway... (povidone, iodine tincture, etc) are *not* forms that you'd want to nebulize though.  'Great' for topical application but not for putting into the body and *definitely* not getting there via the lungs.

Hope that clarifies it a bit?

edit: Oh! shit! I thought this was in reply to a*nother* TB article I posted in /r/health relating to TB in *humans*... ... and recommended nebulizing iodine in that case.

totally missed the /r/livestock component and... ...thus the application changes some.

The basics are the same. Cows, chickens, goats, lambs, pigs, etc all need iodine.. ..and utilize it in much the same way that humans do.

In fact, iodine was the defacto used for 50+ years in livestock.  It really only began to fall out of favor during the mid-'70's and Reagan did a pretty hard hack job on it... .... 'conspiracy theories abound' on that one, but what essentially happened is that as the antibiotic industry was *really* starting to ramp up in the US.. ..and antibiotics were being developed for livestock, the transition began to happen.

Before then, 'iodine sufficiency' was used.  Again, iodine builds up in the fluids of the 'animal' (humans included), and, as such, ends up 'all over the body'... ..including the meat, fat, and other tissues.  'Excess' iodine leaves the body just like 'excess fluids' do... ..and with the fluids.   so, sweat, saliva, urine... ...semen, and milk.  (probably missing some but you get the idea).

As such... ... people used to get a *lot* more iodine than they do now... ...it'd be in the meats (ie, in the 'fluids', blood, cells, etc) it'd be in the milk, etc.

It'd keep pathogens suppressed if not kill them off altogether.  There's actually a great deal of published peer-reviewed science literature out there on it. ...albeit it largely *dated* now, but the type of science it is doesn't really tend to change.

That said, I *believe* I've posted some to /r/iodide relating to the livestock industry...  ...if I haven't I definitely need to get back to it.   but, yeah, animals had it mixed in their feed, it was in their water, it was even pumped into the air of the pens &amp; holding areas.

You can do this yourself in your house, office, etc... ...a standard b.s. Vick's vaporizer filled with water &amp; iodine tincture (the alcohol will breakdown in this case... so it's 'ok'... ..nebulizing tincture though puts it right up to your mouth and nose and... ...the alcohol doesn't have a chance to disperse and, thus, gets inhaled.  not good. esp considering its rubbing alcohol not Petron)...

at that, the iodine will 'move around the air' and essentially help to sterilize the air.

On a larger scale... ...overhead misting systems.  Think those misters on the front porch of Cracker Barrel ... to keep the rocking chair crowd cool on hot summer days... ...same deal, just with iodine in it.

Or industrial sized vaporizers... etc.  Either way, it helps to sterilize the air, killing pathogens, limiting spread of disease... ...it also helps to weigh odorific compounds down and get them out of the air so they smell a bit better.. ..plus it helps to keep the animals cool.

and, if the iodine is there, they'll naturally inhale it.  Iodine functions as a stimulant to the brain (not a bad thing just something to make note of).. ..so, doing this later in the day isn't a good idea... ...think drinking coffee or taking a 5 hour energy before bed..  ....but during the morning-through-late afternoon, possibly even the early evening.. ...it will help the environment as well the animals... ..as they'll naturally inhale some of it.

...obviously much lower quantities vs what would be in their diet (mixed with food, added to water, etc) ... but, those approaches don't get it into lungs quite the same ways as vaporized &amp; inhaled iodine.

A really interesting history as it pertains to livestock... ...and, honestly? One that I think should be even *more* widespread than it was.. ..people *need* iodine, people *don't* want antibiotics in it (by &amp; large anyway... or at least given the whole 'antibiotic-free' 'movement' the past 10-15+ years).. ...just one of those things I guess.

Mercury's greatest dangers are via amalgams and vaccines. I've had(/have?) mercury poisoning... ...and have since largely detoxed from it.   ...and had to learn a shitload about it in the process.

Again, dietary mercury isn't really the issue... ...as long as people don't eat like absolute crap.

Inhaled mercury (and plutonium too I suppose) is a different situation... ...but the cancer is easily enough 'cured' (if developed) or avoided to begin with via iodine sufficiency.  

Though [this entire video](https://youtu.be/ZBM2qWKkFxE?t=2219) is worth watching, the section starting at the 37m mark and running through the end of the video deals specifically with cancer... and the slide-shown specifically with *lung* cancer. ... and [this paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iodide/comments/309ptb/extrathyroidal_benefits_of_iodine_pdf/) is a short &amp; quick read that is well worth it that elaborates a bit farther on it.

Obviously the idea is to avoid the shit that causes cancer to begin with... ...and contains mercury... ...and *not* letting the shit get released into the atmosphere and environment in general is probably a *really* smart idea towards that end... ...as is not running a nuclear power plant based on 60 year old designs.  I'm pro-nuclear, .. as well pro- using 'old stuff' that's still usable... ...but, some 'old things' whether usable or not is simply better replaced with something that's a bit safer and.. ..less likely to wreak havoc on the surrounding environment if/when/as it 'breaks'.

1401,"Yes and no. Better support for higher concentrations of biodiesel would definitely be awesome... but it's not the 'total answer'.

At the end of the day, VW group actively manipulated testing and, ultimately, broke the law.  Though I don't see NOx as being as big of a deal as its made out to be, and the entire thing as more a political maneuvering to 'punish' them for having 'shown the world' that *much* higher fuel economies could be reached *way* sooner &amp; easier than countries target-dates for those levels are set.... ...and in an awesome set of cars at that!.. ...

*An* answer lay in supporting, promoting, and all out '*pushing*' [diazatrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph)-rich fertilizers... ...*including* for use on biodiesel crop plantings.  An excellent [company](http://www.sumagrow.com/) with one [helluva product](http://seedstock.com/2012/07/05/too-good-to-be-true-not-so-says-microbial-cultivator-and-creator-of-organic-soil-enhancement-product-sumagrow/) is SumaGrow ...

Obviously this would work towards not only sequestering N2 and increasing sequestration rates of *C*O2... ... thus helping them to help compensate for the increased emissions their cars released during their 'scandalous years' (and possibly making a helluva lot of money in the process!), it would still require some sort of active approach towards helping to convert atmospheric NOx levels into N2 levels.

Not sure how best to do this... ...though it happens naturally in the atmosphere (the sunlight will breakdown the NOx into N2 and O2 pretty quickly... (note to self: look into length of time atmospheric NOx lasts before breaking down) ... ....the real problem with it is the (lung) health impact of this.

A great PR way they could address this would be... ..seeing as how cities have higher population concentrations, as well, I'd imagine, city &amp; urban dwellers are more the 'type' to buy VW's in the first place... ...working with rooftop [urbanag](/r/urbanagriculture) operations and 'greening' buildings... ...do rooftop [solar](/r/solarenergy) and/or [VAWTs](/r/windenergy) to power large air-suction catalytic converter deals that literally suck the air into them, clean it up.. ...possibly compress it... ..and feed the captured N2 &amp; CO2 into the rooftop greenhouses for N2 &amp; CO2 fertilization.

It would be a great PR stunt, the excess power could/would be sold to the building and/or ag operation (if an urban ag operation like this uses much electricity I'd be surprised)... ...it would get VW into 'urban food production' and thus all over marketing relative to that 'growing movement', it would help green the hell out of their image, it *could* play into a hybrid / electrification campaign if the ('excess') power produced was pushed down to street or garage-based ev power stations... ...and coincide it with an expansion of their hybrid lines and/or pure ev's?

while also addressing urban NOx &amp; CO2 levels... ...and, well... be pretty badass.  The whole thing could probably not only be neutral in cost but *profitable*.

A few years back VW group was the richest (holding) company in the world... as well the largest auto manufacturer...  the stock being a subset of it... ...Obviously Apple has superseded them, and this scandal hasn't helped anything but... ...they still have *plenty* of cash with which to afford this..  ..and, imo? it'd be an awesome 'f' you' to those who triggered the revelation of their indiscretions to begin with.  (a 65mpg+ Jetta when an Prius only gets 45mpg?  and during a time where most cars are advertising 35mpg as 'great' fuel economy??) ... i'm sure it pissed off a LOT of oil cronies!)

Move out of the 'urban campaign' and ramp up support for higher concentrations of biodiesel... ...*while* pandering to the 'college' and 'hipster crowed' (their target market/audience anyway) and do it all with hemp?!?  ... push the SumaGrow aspect... and, hell, throw in some cross marketing with [biochar](/r/bioachar) on the carbon negative CO2 end... ... fields and fields of... ..thousands of acres of hemp... ..grown in carbon negative biochar-rich soil and fertilized with nitrogen fixing SumaGrow that helps to reduce water and fertilizer inputs while limiting runoff pollution?

They'd have hipsters, hempsters, and hippies the world over blowing wads every time they saw a commercial... ...would sell more cars than they could probably keep up production levels with... ...and *easily* pay for the cost of this whole thing.

Spin. It's all about proper spin.  They're sitting on a platinum mine of potential profits if they spin this right. It's VW, it isn't like they're going bankrupt nor going away.

Push it the 'right way' and broker the deals in a decentralized fashion, having them already in place before launching the marketing campaign... ...and launch it Super Bowl half time or something... ...spring it all into place all at once showing 'the possibilities' of what their 2017 line up of cars will start? ... it'd be the perfect 'f' you!' 


oh, and [algae](/r/algae).  9500 gallons of ethanol per acre per year via Algenol's process (higher via other algae strains, but Algenol has by far the best 'system'.. and advancement in other strain-types are easily integrated into it)... ... 9500gpa/py *plus* 1'500 gpa/py of other, longer h-c chains, biodiesel-included... ....they could run a reverse-spin campaign showing how the world thinks of algae as polluting waterways and choking off local wildlife... all fed by synthetic Nitrogen-based fertilizer runoff... ... and show how the SumaGrow &amp; biochar not only limits (stops? reverses even??) this... ...but how algae itself can be the *solution*... ...the ethanol-rich component of it allows them to show 'greenness' in their gas/ethanol-powered line as well.  ... 

...and if they pushed [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass) fields (also with biochar and diazatrophs) ... ...they could show how they aren't just going [carbon neutral](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/grass-makes-better-ethanol-than-corn/) but carbon *negative*... ..literally promote the idea that for every gas-powered car, x-acres of switchgrass will be planted... ...so even though they fill up at a standard station's pump... ..they can know that a percentage of the ethanol they're putting into their car is potentially carbon negatively produced ethanol from VW's growing switchgrass fields... or at most, carbon neutral from their algae farm partnerships.

...be it via the biochar (if the pulp produced is used to make that) ... ..or through a replenishable/renewable paper production via the pulp being used for paper-making.

They could spin the f' out of this... and make a freakin' killing off of it in the process.

Really great people, had an excellent grasp of *various* approaches... *including* iodine for the treatment of cancer.. ..and even had experience (and success) using it towards brain cancers... ....when incorporating other approaches as well.


To top it off, they're not just all MDs with surgical capability (though they'd usually work closely-intimate with a specialist for that specific type of surgery), they're also a non-profit and do all of their work 'at cost' of labs, tests, etc... ...and even help patients that can't afford that find alternative means of payment for it (government programs, donations, loans, etc).

Can't say that every office is this way, each seem to have their own 'approach', so to type... ...but, I must say, 'going it alone' *does* seem like a 'silly' and, more likely, *dangerous* approach.

If nothing else, get some tests done to get an idea of what you're dealing with.

you're either/or approach towards change is idealistically unrealistic at the least, and immaturely naive along the way.

&gt; I'd also strongly prefer agriculture to be solely focused on providing better food for people not fuel products.

why??  We're using *less* land for agriculture now than we were ten years ago, let alone 50.

On top of that, we're now getting fuel from these lands.  On top of *that*, [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass), [algae](/r/algae), etc are many many times the amount of fuel/energy per acre vs the current dominants (corn &amp; soy).  ... so even *less* land would be needed.

...and I've posted many many many more over the past several *years* relating to the topic.

land is not in limitation when it comes to agriculture or food development. Much more food can be grown per acre than even is in California... ...let alone Iowa.

The crop-type is the issue.  and, when it comes to 'crops' like switchgrass, it's actually a (controlled) re*turn* to replanting the native grasses that covered many of these fields not a century ago.

The food vs fuel debate is an old one... ...and one orchestrated and pushed by those looking for tax writeoffs, grants, and changes in policy so they could dual-purpose their crop-type... ....the vast majority of corn harvested is used for both fuel *and* food, it's just different parts of the same harvest.

I have zero doubt fast-charging can happen at a very quick rate... ..and, like Tesla and others have proven... people are very used to the idea of 'plugging in at night' ... ..albeit, most of the time it's their phone but the concept clearly applies to cars as well once the habit is formed.

Charging isn't the issue,... honestly, nor is range anxiety... ..that, too, is just something pushed out there to give contract-journalists something to write about lest they starve.

Trees, honestly, pale in comparison to the benefits.  Not to mention that switchgrass roots will go 10-15 feet deep into the ground.... some strains can go 20 to even 30ft deep to get water and minerals... ..are extremely drought tolerant, are the native grass to the US, are easily controlled from an invasive species perspective, (taking a little while to establish themselves and easily removed... so, not a crazy issue if introduced into environments where they aren't native)... ...and, their harvests can be / often-are perfectly timed with wildlife habitat needs ... nesting, burrowing, etc ... ...with harvests coming once younglings are grown up enough to fend for themselves... ...as well, during migration, the grasses are higher... ..seeds, insects, etc.. ...and harvested before frost... ..ie, when most animals are burrowing in as well have flown south. ... ...again, they're the 'predominant native grasses' of N.America.... ...so, kinda-sorta built for the environment quite well.

1582,"[switchgrass](/r/switchgrass) is faster growing, very lignocellulosic, and builds a root structure that's nearly as large.

It can be cut back, harvested 2-3x a year (more depending on location) using standard hay bailing equipment, pelletized and used as a fuel source... or it can be [gasified](/r/gasification) via [anaerobic digestion](/r/anaerobicdigestion) *and*/or pyrolysis... ...the byproduct of the prior can be used as a pulp material for paper production... or gasified farther via [pyrolysis](/r/pyrolysis) and... ...turned into biochar &amp; [syngas](/r/syngas).

Switchgrass can produce 15tonnes per acre per year (or more with more advanced, faster-growth / lower-input strains being produced.. both through selective breeding as well genetic modification.... so, 'best of both world' depending on where one lies in that argument).

This is much higher than trees within the same time period.   Truthfully trees really don't compare with grasslands (growing certain/specific grass-types) ... so replacing grasslands with 'grasslands (of specific grass-types)' probably makes more sense from a carbon sequestration standpoint than replacing grasslands with trees.

1586,"oh, and /r/switchgrass , /r/soil , /r/biomass , /r/gasification , /r/anaerobicdigestion , /r/pyrolysis , /r/syngas , /r/biofuel .... the list goes on.

point is: why build these when we can plant a fast growth native perennial grass that provides habitats for wildlife (between harvests.. which generally time up with when said native wildlife need denser habitats from said native grasses) ... provides fuel/energy, builds soil (and all the benefits from that), and sequesters 'huge' volumes of carbon.... ..both in the plants-harvested, as well the roots and increase in soil microbiology?

all for a fraction the cost while also giving farmers something to do and helping to return the lands used for this to a near-natural level.

vs corn? soy? etc? ... those are 'useless'.  The EROEI of switchgrass vs corn (for ethanol... ...let along just hydrogen-rich syngas in general... which can be used as a straight-swap for [n.gas](/r/naturalgas) in modern turbines.. and even upgraded old ones).. ..is 8-15x depending on strains-used (newer strains are even more efficient than older ones) .. ...so, 1 acre of switchgrass could theoretically replace 8-15 acres of corn, for example.

and, if first anaerobically digested (to produce, say, ethanol), with the resulting pulp being used for paper or as a construction material (or simply readded back to soils for building soil carbon health)... ...or gasified via pyrolysis in a second-stage gasification process ... ...which would 'eek out' any remaining Hydrogen atoms not removed during the first stage gasification via anaerobic digestion... ..the result would be biochar which, on a weight-by-weight level means ~1lb of biochar would be ~1lb of carbon removed from the atmosphere... ...and *kept* out for over 100 years (biochar can last for thousands to tens of thousands of years)... ...and, once added back to soil, the biochar not only retains water, cuts fertilizer inputs, reduces runoff, and helps increase soil health... ...but it does so at a rate that the carbon in the soil that builds up because the biochar has been added reduces the biochar added to ~1/3rd the amount of carbon sequestered .. .. specifically vs soils where biochar *hasn't* been added... .and, since biochar helps to retain soil health, and helps to keep the carbon in the soil for a very long time before 'gassing out'... .... it would remain there for much longer than simply adding organic carbon to the soil (ie, say, with compost, manure, or simply adding the pulp from anaerobic digestion of switchgrass back to the soil pre- a pyrolysis step).

That means that 1lb of biochar added to the soil results in 2 additional pounds of carbon being removed from the atmosphere and building up in the soil.. ..and staying there (1+2 = 3 pounds total.. just to show that the biochar isn't included in those 2lbs).  And, again, helping to keep that carbon there for much much longer even *if* soil health is ignored by a farmer adding industrial quantities of synthetic fertilizer (not needed) to the crop in an attempt to get larger yields. (nitrogen-fixing [diazotroph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazotroph)-containing biological fertilizes like [SumaGrow](http://www.sumagrow.com) contains reduce the necessity for N-based fertilizers by up to 80% and P-based fertilizers by 60%+ via them also containing [PSB's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_solubilizing_bacteria))

Save these types of carbon filters for city roofs and the like.

Helping to pull the carbon out from within the city for higher quality air... ...with the farms of switchgrass (and other fast-growth perennial high-lignocellulosic crop-types) surrounding the city.. ...both sequestering carbon as well providing energy.

Solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, nuclear, ... fusion-even, etc are carbon neutral at best.   Biomass is the only carbon-*negative* energy source out there.   Let me reword &amp; repeat that, biomass is the only carbon negative energy *source* out there.

I wouldn't want to calculate the engineering calculations and remodeling necessary for green roofs (within cities) to support the weight of the soil and water that would result in planting [switchgrass on roofs](http://www.mass.gov/eea/images/czm/stormsmart/factsheets/3-7-425.png).. ...nor the insurance/liability of harvesting roof-grown [switchgrass](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QIjZXwAi4ag/TBPtqNWl2nI/AAAAAAAABL0/u4en7OlRuAw/s1600/switchgrasscrop.jpg) then lowering it to the ground or processing on-roof... (pelletizing?) for use within the building... ...so, maybe just save the roofs for solar, wind, and [urban agriculture](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QIjZXwAi4ag/TBPtqNWl2nI/AAAAAAAABL0/u4en7OlRuAw/s1600/switchgrasscrop.jpg) ... ..as well, mechanical carbon suckers. ...where economically viable (are these things even capable of economic viability?)

Maybe a rooftop [algae](/r/algae) farm. Those don't seem like they'd weigh as much and as great as switchgrass, miscanthus, etc are at energy density... ..Algenol's algae produces 9500 gallons of ethanol + ~1'500 gallons of other mixed-length hydrocarbons (from pure H up to diesel... and everything in between... butane, propane, methane, octane, etc)... .... with other companies claiming that *their* strains are even *denser* energy producers... (that's per acre-per year).

...with the added benefit that algae are best grown with N2 &amp; CO2 fertilization... ...ie, what comes out of a catalytic converter (which is in every tail pipe and larger engine out there).   so, could sequester carbon produced by the building, for example.. ..with proper gear capturing smokestack emissions from the building, cleaning up the emissions, and redirecting to the algae growth-tanks/set-up

Solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, nuclear, ...fusion-even... ...are great.   but, again, carbon neutral (at best... infrastructure supporting them is still very carbon+!) ... and *definitely* ***not*** carbon-negative.",2015-10-17 23:33:19+00:00,cw3fqme,2.0,t1_cw22skc,106962.0,Green

1655,"&gt; Once we've gotten the method down, then you design small modular reactors.

well, the point with even bringing this one up was because with the Polywell design, Bussard said the max size *was* 5m to begin with.. ...so wiring multiple together would be necessary anyway.

so, 'having the method down' is kinda just integral to that design.  

&gt; achieve fusion with a bigger set up

those focus fusion designs seem pretty small *too* ... granted, they're just trying to get the physics down then most likely would scale up from there?   Not too sure on the sonoluminescence designs... ...if scale is an issue (The Saint &amp; Chain Reaction both deal with these) ... ...but they seem like they'd scale?? 

That prof at Purdue about 6-7 years ago seems like he had a pretty large breakthrough with those .. 6-7 years ago... ...and then 'nothing'.  which seems pretty par for the course for this stuff honestly.

&gt; Why do you think tokomaks are unworkable

for the same reason Bussad does: the neutrons will build up, you can't control/channel them, and, well... you'll have to shut the reactor down until they're absorbed.  This will render it cost-*in*effective.   And when someone asked about advancements in nanotechnology helping with that... ...his response made sense... granted, I feel his understanding of nanotechnology may've been a *bit* 'dated' or possibly 'misunderstood' but... ...he was 'old' so, forgive him??  ... but, at that, it may/will increase efficiency within the design itself, but still not be a 'true' breakthrough.

The idea of a fission-fusion hybrid to utilize the increased neutrons for capturing the energy *via* fission caught my eye a week or two ago when someone else brought it (back) to my attention ... ...but, even then, just.. ..expensive and unwieldy. ... just adds another layer of complexity to an already too-complex system, imo.

This is why Bussard was using aneutronic boron (forget the specific name for it) ... and, as such, it also raises the question of, even if he could get the fusion down, where did the 'excess' energy come from it it *wasn't* coming from 'escaping' neutrons?

thus, it may make a 'neat science experiment' but.. ...is criticality achieved?   as you point out, it's doubtful.

1656,"&gt; When I said other physicists analyzed it, I mean they analyzed the data Bussard got from his reactor. Where Bussard said ""I think if I make A B and C more efficient, it'll become viable, the others said ""No, even if you maximize those aspects, the plasma configuration just isn't dense enough.

oh, well, then... maybe the polywell just isn't the way to go?  but, then, maybe 'fusion' in general isn't?   I mean, it clearly isn't '*needed*' to meet the energy demands of the world anyway...

but, focus fusion seems 'fun'.  maybe it'll work?

&gt; car analogy

well, there's also the decentralized approach of... ...solar panels on people's houses?  factories, 'walmart'-sized buildings, malls, etc.   

the idea of having an air conditioning compressor sized 'unit' or a fridge-sized unit on the side of people's houses or a 'collection of them' at a close-but-less-specific power distribution point...  is knda the premise behind Tesla's powerwall set up or the Energy Bloom shipping container box.

There's nothing that 'necessitates' power be made in some relatively distant, often-ignored power plant on the outside of town and transmission'ed into an urban area.

I always saw a Bussard Polywell-style / -sized unit as working relative to that  .... ...if economic criticality was achieved.

I understand that it's cheaper to scale up oftentimes, i also understand that it may be just as effective to just build a whole lot of smaller units and combine them together ....

I mean, look at servers.. ...some are 'super computers' with dozens of systems inside a single case, and some are just multiple systems put into individual cases then put on a server rack  ... with multiples of those 'wired together' to provide the same purpose.

The idea that you could have a unit or a few unit designs that can literally be built on assembly lines *like* refrigerators, a/c compressors, microwaves, dishwashers... ...car engines... ...etc... .... and then shipped all over inside shipping containers, back of semis, rail car, etc ... then assembled on site...seems possibly just as economic as large singular instillation-types built by specialized crews on site.

Maybe I'm wrong.   Ultimately 'both' would be nice?

but, as far as .... well.... ITER, for example, it would seem that we're relatively on the same page for, our conversation has seemingly been focused around the practicality of the polywell design vs a focus fusion design... with an unstated agreement that ITER-style tokamaks are... ...not the way to go?

1657,"He had published he stated, but there was a new research paper he was talking about publishing in the 7+ year old talk.  He may've passed away before that design came out there.

He also was the most active researching the polywell design, and at the end of the talk he stated that ... well, shit, 'should google go nuclear'  ... you can watch the talk yourself and see what he said.

The point is, others doing theoretical research on it on paper vs Bussard &amp; Co having actually built and tested devices are two different things.. ...and, as such, going with what his hands-on very experienced self said... he had gone through several shape &amp; design configurations and not all of them worked.  Even the ones that worked worked 'less-well' than later designs.  I forget the design-shape he finally said *did* work... in such a way that it didn't 'just-work' but worked even better with more fusions per second than the other shape-forms... ...but, well, he also said that the scale would only be ~5m.

I understand the scale directly equates to the number of fusions per second... ...but, what does it matter if the increase in the number of fusions per second happens in such that the radiation directly scales proportionally as well and, in such, requires the entire reactor to be (uneconomically) shutdown while things cool down enough to allow it to start back up and run again? It isn't *just* about fusion, nor the number of fusions per second.. ..it's about the economics of the entire installation as well.

Distributed power sources of smaller sizes, but able to be made on assembly lines, have the capability of providing power to the end user just as well as larger central plants. ....look at automobiles vs trains as an example.  ...and, when the fuel source &amp; feedstock are things that *aren't* in limited supply *nor* are 'destroying the environment' (like fossil fuels) ... ...and, well, in the case of power plants (even 'at home sized units') aren't driving around crashing into each other... ...what's it really *matter* if they're scaled up or down?

Obviously there have been more recent pop culture references for it but... ... the point is, politics will come into play relative to it. Quite simply, 'unlimited energy' is already available to us via other means (wind, solar, fission, 'biomass', etc) and politics is the main limitation to most of those.

tl;dr: even if a successful fusion device, physics/science, plans and all, were published far &amp; wide today in an easily downloadable format... ...I still think that politics &amp; money would intervene as much as possible to limit it from 'taking off'.   ....regardless of having achieved criticality / a positive ROI.

Totally understand ... ... well, the concept anyway. Which is to say, I understand the concept of EROEI anyway  ...  kinda hard to understand fusion when fusion hasn't been figured out yet by some of the smartest minds in the world working on it so...

point is though... ...even if/when fusion is figured out how to exist with criticality... ...and, criticality in such that it can be continued &amp; scaled up cost effectively after engineering is taken into consideration... ...unless it's done in some way that these things can roll off assembly lines like Fords or dishwashers... ...it's still 'decades away'. 

Now, in the case of his polywell design, he said something about how it has a max size of like 5m or something... ...and if you want more power, you add another unit and just do it in some sort of modular added together deal... ..like adding more solar panels or another wind turbine.. ...vs building a bigger unit.

That said, unless that's the case, ... and even if that's the case... ...it still seems like 'years' away, at best.   ...and I'm honestly not sure the world would 'allow' that to happen.  Or at least the gov'ts of the world would.  Too much is seemingly built around military... ...which is, in turn, pretty much just a reinforcement for protecting energy infrastructure (even agriculture is a subset of this with soy-diesel, corn-ethanol, etc .... which technology has clearly shown there are denser crops for bio-oil/diesel and ethanol; [switchgrass](/r/switchgrass), miscanthus, etc..... [algae](/r/algae) for both... and more)

I suppose my point is.. ...like bussard said, it's an engineering problem (mechanical, political, social, militarial, etc) at this point, not a science/physics one.


Personally? I don't think fusion is 'needed'.   Beneficial? yes. absolutely, but certainly not 'needed' ... ...from the perspective of a limited feedstock nor form of (economical) processing ... nor even availability of feedstock (uranium nor plutonium don't seem like they're in short supply, nor thorium).


So, physics, engineering, and criticality aside... ...I really just don't see 'fusion' (nor its science) as really being the central 'crux' of the issue.   ....regardless of form or approach utilized...

or, put another way, just because 'The Saint' 'gave' sonoluminescence bubble power to the world on live tv in Red Square didn't mean that the people weren't going to still need that heating oil hidden under 'this very building' (if i'm quoting the movie correctly)....

Nor do I think Keanu's forwarding &amp; faxing of details for *his* sound light bubble power configuration were delivered the world over would necessarily mean that 'all the world's energy problems' would be solved in a single blow.  Politics simply wouldn't 'allow' ... and, most people, like the audience-type your messages 'posture' is geared to address are really going to understand (or care) about the underlying physics to... ... be in a position to implement it themselves.. ..let alone know how to do so even if they were.

wow, really love when people ask questions to introduce their rants. Really sets the 'tone' for everything to follow.


&gt; Well, now Iran can get subtle 

and then develop weapons and join Israel on the 'don't ask don't tell club' of nuclear weapon ownership?   Have you ever read about the nuclear industry? Iran is approximately the size of Alaska.. yes, a big state... but still, incredibly difficult to hide operations of that size even when no one's looking for them.. ...let alone when you're under a freakin' microscope.  The requirements of a production process of that size is incredibly difficult to cover up.   ....unless you're already embracing points of infrastructure that, quite simply, don't hide that you have and/or are pursuing nuclear weapons.


&gt; and work around the agreement

the could already do this, and, theoretically *were*.  Now there are more specific stipulations in place with more oversight &amp; a higher resolution of their programs than there was before.   ....as well harsher penalties and global precedence if they *do* violate an agreement.   So, easier to catch, harsher penalty.



&gt; It gives them time and money to figure out a situation that is not time critical but does require money.

to do what? something that they already *weren't* doing when they had plenty of... time &amp; money... leading up to now??


&gt; It can't be any worse for them.

*what* can't be any worse for them?  You've obviously never been on the receiving end of American ordinances dropped from x0,000ft before.  Shit can always get worse. ...if you deny that you are either ignorant or delusional.    There *is* the phrase, 'from bad to worse. from worse to fucked.' for a reason


&gt; proving that they had no interest in either outcome.

possibly because they aren't actually developing nuclear weapons?? ...and don't see where it really matters?

I'd be *really* f'in' leary of letting that guy into some of my most critical, expensive, and central facilities as well.   ...or to even have the conversation *about* them coming in to see them.     but, then, that's just me. 


&gt; could have kept working towards either a better agreement

There are discussions all.the.time.  about better ways to handle nuclear programs.  Just subscribe to a monthly subscription of The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and you'll see what I mean.  Great magazine. Been a subscriber for years (over a decade?) and keep all of my issues just because some of the stuff discussed in them is that 'timeless' and applicable today as it was 10 years ago when it was first printed.   ...why? because the world at large is very begrudging at doing things with its nuclear programs. It's a complex, dangerous, extremely expensive, and highly controversial topic ... hell, Israel isn't even *public* about *its* nuclear programs... ...possibly largely because of this very specific reason.

&gt; ...military option

  oh, there's *no* reason to believe that the UN, NATO, and other war-capable nations of the world aren't sitting around discussing it, adjusting their plans, updating their maps, redrafting their options.  Doesn't mean they have to be openly *public* about it ... ...otherwise they may come across looking like warmongers.   But I have *no* doubts that right.this.very.minute. an Iranian military operation is being adjusted around. ...and that's the same as 10 minutes ago and 10 years ago.. ...and probably will be 10 years from now.

'The biggest threat a soldier has is a full clip/loaded gun'  to butcher the quote. 

&gt; Now it can't because it's less of a priority

sure it can.  and if Iran trips up, breaks any rules, there are now set in place a very structured and detailed response to it.  War with Iran has *not* been removed from the table.  By *any* means.  The US dropped more ordinance on Iraq &amp; Afghanistan *each* than it dropped during the whole of the Vietnam war.  ... and, during the vietnam war it dropped more ordinance in single bombing campaigns than the whole of *all* wars up to that point.  fought by *every*one.   ...and those weapons are only more sophisticated, accurate, and in greater numbers *now* than they were going into &amp; during both of those more-recent campaigns.  You really should study US war history to get a better / richer idea of how bomb-happy the US is. I think what you'll learn will surprise you.  I know it does *me* and I've been studying the shit for decades.. ..and I *still* get surprised when I read into it, watch the footage, and push to learn yet-more about it.  War with Iran has *not* been taken off the table... ...it's just allowed a little 'fat' to get between it and the muscle is all.

&gt; but not naive.

I'm not either. Trust me. In the interim, because we still have some time (and possibly even a bit more now), give [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/science/irans-unsung-plutonium-concession-in-nuclear-deal.html) a read.   and, come on over to /r/nuclear, follow the posts. You may 'enrich' your understanding of nuclear technology a bit.  There's also /r/nuclearpower, /r/thorium, and /r/fusion as well ... ..and, don't forget the large number of war, military, and weapons-related focused subs.

Mental discipline simply does not work in these situations.""[3] In terms of scale, the wasp's sting is rated near the top of the Schmidt sting pain index, second only to that of the bullet ant, and is described by Schmidt as ""blinding, fierce [and] shockingly electric""",2015-09-20 18:31:14+00:00,cv847i1,1.0,t3_3lpbj4,6.0,WASPs

I feel like vanadium redox... ...or even a fuel cell with reverse/electrolysis would be better .... much longer lifespan ... and power density is less of an issue when it comes to a house.

The idea that a house would have a refrigerator sized unit inside their garage, basement, or outside next to their a.c. compressor would make more sense... 


if H2 turns to pure water... then just have it fill into a separate tank.. ...when the power is in excess, electrolyze of the pure water back into H2 and recompress it ... ....or, just, compressed air storage on the side of a house.

there's a $4 off coupon inside one of the top flaps... for what that's worth... ...and I've found them cheapest at Vitamin Shoppe.

They're a bit more expensive initially, but they're all cfu's, guaranteed potency by date of expiration (vs date of manufacture), and more organisms per single pill than most products claim per dose of theirs. ...GoL/RAW recommends 3 a day... but, this is excessive, imo.  1 a day or even 1 every-other day after the colonies have gotten themselves established is more than sufficient to keep it going.. ...in my experience.   that means that a single 90 pill bottle can be stretched out up to 6 months... longer if you don't have as much going on.  ...and that brings the price down to *below* most of the competition out there, while also having more strain-types than any other product (I've found) out there.

1831,"I follow the difference... I just don't see funding to the nuclear industry... be it for R&amp;D or 'private' commercial reactors... as having a fixed budget.

Like, I don't see it as $x m/billion a year and then it's an allocation issue... ...sure there is *some* sort of 'cap' on what's spent towards it, but I see it as being largely arbitrary honestly.  Like, the gov't / a committee could vote to increase funds just as easily as decrease them altogether.

I just don't think it works that way.  There's nothing that I've read in my 15-20 years about this industry that's really led me to believe that.   I mean, I've read where people *approach it* as that ... but, quite simply, they're ... ...'incorrect'. 

&gt; What's the value in all these different variants sitting on the 'shelves'

I'm not sure if this is a question or a statement. The period at the end leaves me to believe it's simply a statement, but I'll respond as if it's a question.

I don't think they *would* be sitting on the shelves.  There are a *lot* of components to a reactor... let alone various reactor designs.  Improving efficiency on some seemingly minute component may have a lot of science behind it in such that it can carry over to other design-types.  It isn't so much 'sitting on the shelves' as it is 'figuring it out' ...in such that it can be implemented as upgrades, repairs, etc are done.  

&gt; I'm also arguing that advocating these different variants sends the message that the safety standards and etc of the current generation is not sufficient.

would you make this same argument for the 'dozens' of different car-types that are out there made by different manufacturers?  Does the fact that Audi makes one type of seat belt latch in their latest A6 line really make you scared of their previous A6 seat belt latch types?  Or fear the Mercedes 500SL latch type just because it's different?   What about fuel injector-type or... more broadly, just a different car model altogether?   

I understand the perspective from an outside perspective.. ...from a mass market pr perspective ... but, public opinion largely only sways internal decision making... ..it doesn't make it itself.   Those within the industry 'know what's up'.  No one cares about one reactor type or another. As any random person on the street and they couldn't tell you the difference between one powerplant type or another. Like, they just.don't.care. 

So it's really only variety within an industry of people who are, for the most part, intelligent enough to know that the variety is... ...just that: variety.

The fear or safety issue/standard component is, quite simply, put there from an outside public perspective that simply doesn't know one way or another.

..... 

&gt; Well ar least that's the message that alot laymen get 

exactly. 'laymen'.  The industry itself, and esp the intra-policy makers are 'well versed' on what's going on before they ever put their vote on the line or implement a new set of rules or design type.

&gt; and the nuclear industry is very sensitive to those sentiments as illustrated by the massive investments in fusion research compared to fission.

personally? I don't really equate the two. Fusion funding is largely a 'science project' by comparison.   ....and, I'm personally of the opinion that the various large scale gov't backed fusion projects around are simply a place to shove (and bury) a shitload of talent under a 'false dream'.  Like Bussard said, tokamaks will never work. or at least they'll never be profitable. It's a waste of money. Great science, but even most of that can be figured out on paper... so no real breakthroughs there either ... ...and any that are are more of an engineering nature.

What's that documentary called? ""Thorium is what fission wanted to be'

be that true or not, the point is, from the public's perspective... it doesn't give a shit (or know the difference) between a major advancement against some 60 year old fission approach and a totally new approach towards it.... all it sees &amp; hears is 'new nuclear wah wah to be developed'.    and, the word 'nuclear' puts them in freak out mode (or not).  Call a fission plant a 'nuclear fusion plant' and people would do the same.   ... sure the addition of 'fusion' adds *some* relief to it but... ...truth, if this sub were called 'fission' (the sold post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fission/) shoudl give you an idea how how much people give a fuck) people would probably just get confused relative to fusion and go about their day figuring out why Pandora keeps playing the same shitty songs over &amp; over.



my overall point, if i have one... is that, there is no real cap on nuclear funding. We're spending tens of billions a year on nuclear weapons. ...w/out much concern for the budgetary aspects of that. No cares about the money from the perspective of 'fitting within what's allocated' .   ...what they care about is... ..that it 1) doesn't do anything for weapons 2) creates a fuel source in such a way that has *less* negatives to hang it up on than what's already there and C) how is this going to fuck with my coal, n.gas, and petro backers?

1838,"Like u/eosha said, it's great for improving sub-par lands... helps retain water/moisture, reduces runoff, increase soil microbial health/activity, retains nutrients, etc.  ... if land already has a good percentage of carbon in its soil, you'll see less of an improvement of production.   

...but, that'st not to say *not* to do it. I'm of the opinion that maintaining a higher carbon content in the soil is more beneficial than letting it reduce itself. There seems to be plenty of science backing this up... as well a good deal of common sense.

from the perspective of 'improving yield', it's just a part of what's needed though.  ...albeit, a pretty *big* part, but by no means is it 'have high C content and crops will flourish', water&gt;to&gt;wine, heaven on earth ... as a lot of people would lead one to believe.

[biochar](/r/biochar) is it's 'own thing'.  on the one hand, sure, it increases carbon in the soil, but it *isn't* SOC (soil organic carbon).  it's more of a... ..another amendment; like gypsum or rock dust or others.   It helps 'structure' the soil. It helps set the conditions for SOC to build.

One of the industry buzzterms for biochar is/was 'condos for microbes'.  The porosity of biochar adds a lot to the soil... and, more so than, say, gypsum, diatomaceous earth, etc.  It not only helps to retain water, nutrients, other amendments (fertilizers, minerals, etc), but also promotes organic life (bugs, roots, fungi, microbes, etc) to flourish.  Imo, biochar is ... ...well, two things: it's a jack of a whole lot of trades and a master of 'none' of them, per se... more 'a benefit' than a 'necessity'.  the other thing is, it's a 'ballast' for the soil: rain too much? the biochar will help the soil absorb the extra water.. move to deeper regions of the soil, run off if necessary / that much water... but do so in such a way that the soil (with help of the biochar) will hold onto the nutrients, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.  ...a 'filter' of sort, keeping behind the stuff you want kept behind.

depending on the quantity of biochar in the soil, and the rest of the SOM (soil organic matter), it'll help to retain as much of the water that the soil needs or may need... while helping excess get out of there before causing problems.  It'll keep that moisture locked up in the soil in such a way that it not only doesn't-promote root rot, but actually helps prevent it.  It 'holds onto' the nutrients, water, etc... strongly enough to keep it there, but weakly enough that the microbes, fungi, plant roots can easily access it... pull it away and utilize it when they need to.

On the other hand, *because* it holds onto the nutrients, water, etc... if it goes to the other extreme, if it's a run of dry period... up to and including the conditions of 'a [drought](/r/drought)', the biochar will help hold onto those nutrients, water, etc ... in such a way that there's more of it there for the plants... to keep them and the soil healthy until the next water application (rain, irrigation, 'whatever').     obviously if it's a long period of no rain, biochar-alone may not be enough, a change in practices will most likely be in order... adding irrigation, changing crop-type, etc.

but, i'm also of the opinion that if *enough* biochar were in place... say, 5% or more biochar by volume... across 5% or more of farmland over an area the size of a state or a region... Iowa, the midwest, etc ... ...that the increase in moisture would actually create its own 'micro'climate over that region ... allowing an increase in rain and overall humidity in that area due to the retention that it could possibly begin to ... ...well, geoengineer the area. ...if on a large enough scale.


but, backing out of that,... biochar can stand up to very acidic and alkaline environments... much higher extremes in pH optimal for growing conditions ... ..and not breakdown while exposed to them.   ...in such that an excess in one amendment or another... say, too much synthetic fertilizer... that *isn't* accompanied with the neutralizing carbon of biologically added nitrogen from diazotrophs for example (which tend to add about 2 parts carbon to every 1 part nitrogen... or higher C:N ratio even... ...so, sure the acidity of an increase in nitrogen, but also an increase in the neutral to slightly-alkaline environment the SOC provides) ... ... this excess nitrogen will 'burn back' the organic carbon in the soil, 'dissolving' it into CO/CO2 much faster.. and the soil can/will 'evaporate' or 'exhale' its SOC.    The biochar not only helps to 'filter' this C.. from the CO/CO2 / soil evaporation/exhalation ... keeping it in the soil longer, and giving other biota in the soil a chance to utilize it ... ....but it also promotes microbial activity within the soil in such that even if a excessively heavy dose of N *is* applied, ...and, subsequently, much of the organic carbon in the soil lost... ...the soil can rebuild itself much much faster.

Think of biochar as a sort of 'restore point' or 'backup' for the soil (windows/computer analogy).   in such that, even if the soil crashes, it will crash back to the point of the biochar, and... ..the biochar can help rebuild it again.     assuming there's enough biochar of course... but even if there's 'just a little', the soil will *still* be able to rebound much easier, faster, and... well, 'at-all'.. vs... say, reducing farther down into even smaller particles and becoming clay or something.

also, the biochar does this in such a way that, once added, it's damn-near impossible to remove  (in a good way, imo).  so, if your intention *was* to destroy soil... do add biochar. ... or else you'd have to dig below the depth the biochar was added and had managed to be pushed during its time there.. ...but, if you were just an idiot with good intentions... and accidentally destroyed the SOM... the biochar would absorb as much of what destroyed the soil as it could (the more biochar, ... and/or the higher the porosity of the biochar... the more it can absorb, obviously).  and, from there, the conditions can neutralize and... the soil can begin to rebuild.

so, again, a sort of ballast for the soil, helping the soil withstand extreme fluctuations in conditions.    even if there *are* drought or drought-like conditions... a heavy flooding rain... whereby the biochar absorbed as much of the excess water as its capacitance would allow.. and helped to control the runoff of nutrients of the excess *beyond* what it could... ....and then slow-released or made-available that water... ...and rainless conditions persisted... ....a farmer *could* irrigate in excess if need be... and feel more confident that their water was being put to good use... ...as much more of it would be absorbed into the soil, refilling the biochar/surrounding soil... than simply running off.

Biochar has been shown to reduce water by up to 90% in more extreme cases... possibly farther in the *most* extreme cases...  a more practical estimate would be ~25%, but 50% is *quite* common.  a 'smart farmer' [irrigating](/r/irrigation) the same volume of water over a few days vs 'all at once' would get much more from it... and, help the ground soak up more.. as well the biochar.

this could, in turn, help survive an unexpected persistent dry period... with the aid of irrigation... even *through* a drought period.   

and, biochar 'lasts forever'.  generally on the order of 'about a century', but, in truth, it could last millenia... longer even.  It's very difficult to carbon date inorganic carbon of the nature that activated carbon / biochar is.  ..so, there's really 'no way of knowing' just *how* long the 'old biochar' has been in the soils its found in.

That said... *because* of this, yes, the increase in soil activity would lead to an increase in carbon sequestered... *beyond* the biochar.
There was a statistic floating around in the biochar world for a while that stated that once biochar was added to the soil, that biochar became 1/3rd of the increase of SOC specifically *tied* to the biochar application...  meaning, add 10lbs of biochar to the soil, and specifically because the biochar was added, there will be another 20lbs of carbon stored in that soil... beyond the 10# of the biochar... vs soil where biochar hasn't been added.  and, again, the biochar will help to *keep* it there... if not potentially increase the addition in subsequent periods.

The increase has been attributed to 1 part: an increase in plant growth due to the biochar.. roots, the plant itself, etc   and 2) an increase in soil microbial growth, activity, and content.  Thus, 10lbs of biochar (which is sequestered carbon as is... (plants get 98% of their carbon from inhaled/atmospheric CO2... on average), leads to an additional 10# of carbon sequestered in the soil due to the increase in soil microbial activity (fungi predominately, but bacteria, bugs, worms, protozoa, etc as well) .. specifically because the biochar was added... and another 10# of sequestered carbon in the increase in plant growth vs soils where biochar wasn't added.  

I don't know the number off the top of my head, but the world's soils contain *way* more carbon than the world's atmosphere. 

so/thus, yes, increasing SOC *would* go a long way towards mitigating global carbon levels.. and any results that may happen from that.

but, even if we could sequester all the carbon civilization releases into the atmosphere.. and increase soil health &amp; farm yields as a result.. ..that doesn't mean that adding it to the atmosphere in the first place doesn't 'change things'.  Fossilized carbon buried deep underground coming to the surface is *still* carbon being shifted from a non-atmospheric locale to one in the atmosphere... even if it's then going to be pulled down into a plant and 'cooked' into char only to be put back in the ground (soil... ~top 6""-1ft in this case) ... 

so, thus, like /u/eosha typed, more an improvement for sub-quality than good land.",2015-09-08 03:50:26+00:00,cuu3iq3,5.0,t1_cuu0a6t,6511.0,farming

humans could populate the galaxy exponentially practically. ...and none of this brings in the Asgard galaxy ... as well the other galaxies that they'd traveled to.

google: 'A123 hymotion' or 'A123 prius hymotion'

google-images may be even more revealing.

I'm pretty sure it's 'dead' now but, the idea always made a helluva lot of sense to me.   I'm sure some efficiency is lost due to the added weight and, again, the 'balance' of the car being thrown off from the added weight of the cells but.... ....the idea always made a lot of sense to me.

I'm still a big fan of an 'petro-engine generator trailer' concept ... whereby a trailer is hooked up to an ev that's also integrated into an onboard computer of the car and, well ... the engine is fueled with gas, diesel, kerosene, n.gas (so you could fill up at home!?), etc ... and the engine is designed to do one thing: power a generator.... and the generator, in turn, can power the car and/or charge the batteries.

to make it 'worthwhile' it'd obviously need to be able to provide 100% of the power to the car... *and* probably a bit excess to charge up the batteries... ...but, to take something like that on a roadtrip? 

if it were 'rentable' from the dealer... potentially to be dropped off at the 'local dealer' in the city being driven to (suppose Hertz, Enterprise, etc would provide them too?)   such as to not have to rent 'all the time'?  as well, 'night time drop offs/pick-ups'  (presumably with some sort of app-card-combination deal?)

that way you don't have to *buy* one... ...but, also, for auto manufacturers to make one that you can buy... either at time of purchase or later... presumably to integrate into the standard loan/payment on the car? ... 

and make it so that they can color-match the car you're buying ... and, work with the same key/remote deal... be parked, locked, locked up, and left (safely) in parking lots (hotel/motel, local dealer, etc) ... ...but, that's kinda-sorta where the whole 'why buy when you can just rent from the dealer... ...and, make it Zip Car-easy with some sort of Uber-app deal where you can check availability, pick up 'whenever you want', have charged to an account w/out having to deal with calling the dealer, etc ... ..as well, reserving, and what not for planned trips.. ...it'd just go off availability at that dealer / pick-up location.

hell, technically, the trailer could just *be* a battery pack... on a trailer.   that plugs into the car via some proprietary cable that can handle enough voltage to either power the car and/or bypass the car's local batteries and tie directly into how the built-in batteries power the car.

One of the biggest problems with agricultural statistics is that they generally include grazing lands in them.... to make them sound bigger.   

Humanity really needs to switch off of beef as a primary protein source.  Obviously it's more of an 'American-thing' but it's growing.... with most 'modernizing cultures' adopting western traditions, that includes western dietary trends....

algae &amp; insects are an excellent source of nutrients.  

I don't think the problem is so much the 'carrying capacity *capabilities*' of the planet, so much as the cultural approach towards them.

We can grow foods *much* more densely than we do, we just don't.. ...we're [beginning to](/r/urbanagriculture) much more... believe I read the other day that &gt;40% of Russia's food comes from backyard gardens... and it's a growing number (it used to be even higher).

Vertical farms are just now getting their foot in the door... I'm of the opinion that many will fail.. esp in the earlier renditions ... (as has happened with the one in Vancouver) ... but the concept itself will only continue to pick up traction and, as such, produce will 'densify' in the process.

The problem is also the crop-types being grown. Corn, soy, wheat, etc just won't cut it.  They require way too much energy, way too much land, way too many resources, and cause way too many problems... and they'll all continue to just keep getting worse (as they are) as things move forward.

I'll check out the doc, but my problem with it is that those things are usually fairly limited on 'paths forward' vs pointing out problems... ...and, well, it's the 'paths forward' that are more interesting to me as the problems are pretty well pointed out at this point.   granted, they usually have pretty pictures and scenescape shots.",2015-08-03 03:22:26+00:00,ctpj9jt,2.0,t1_ctphj5k,3412.0,overpopulation
1995,"i wouldn't say it was me '*defending*' fluoride... .as much as saying that calcification of the pineal gland isn't something that's *as* big of a deal as it's made out to be.   ...as well, it's generally something that tends to happen over a much *longer* period of time... ...as in 'old people'.

The body has a pretty good set of systems in place for removing excess fluoride (which it needs... in trace amounts... single to barely-double-digit mcg quantities...) ... as it does *other* trace minerals that it needs... ...and, well, pretty much *any*thing else that it needs but may have too much of.

I do *not* think that fluoride should be added to tap water. I think that there should be more fluoride-free options in the dental aisle than in there are with-fluoride options (pretty much flip-flopped).  I'm of the opinion that bones, teeth, etc would heal/repair themselves much more efficiently if they *weren't* covered in a layer of fluoride...

I'm not a 'fan' of fluoride. I think it does way more harm than good... i think that our iodine insufficiency is a huge issue.  but, at that, from what I've read over the past year or two... once iodine is there in sufficient quantities, the body makes the decision to use *it*... instead of the fluoride... and, quite simply, will 'flush out' the fluoride that it'd been holding onto instead.

...in such that, though it's *best* to avoid fluoride (essentially impossible), with sufficient iodine, the body can 'generally' 'sort it out'.

1999,"&gt;  Due to it's large molecular structure it cannot pass the blood brain barrier 

large *molecular* structure? it's fluoride. ie, it's ionic fluorine. It's *smaller* than chlorine. It's *way* smaller than iodine.

It's also an individual atom. there *is* no 'molecular structure' to it.

It's not that I'm disagreeing with you (I am), it's that you're wrong. Fluoride *does* make it past the bb/b. very much so.  Calcification of the pineal gland very much so *does* happen, but not for the reasons your saying.  and, yes, fluoride *does* play a *huge* role in this when it happens, but it happens much *less* often than is put forth by the 'wacko' sites out there that talk about 'third eye' b.s.  ...you know the ones i'm talking about, the ones with tie dyed banners and pyramid advertisements. 

It isn't to say that it doesn't happen, and it isn't to say that fluoride has *any* real benefit in the human body ... besides the very small trace quantities that the body gets it... which it would *easily* get even if we never drank a single drop of fluoridated tap water or ate foods water with fluoridated tap water.

Fluoride is, essentially, poison... esp at the levels it's added to water.  Fluoride most definitely funks up the body's handling of calcium. Fluoride definitely plays a *huge* contributing role to any calcification that may happen... *any*where in the body, esp the pineal gland.  just not under the mechanics you put forth.

Iodine &amp; iodide are what the body needs when it pulls in the other halogens. /r/iodide is your friend. check it out.

iodine &amp; viruses? may be another you'll want to check out.  Iodine destroys every.single.virus. no questions ask.  Sufficient quantities of iodine (and iodide) in the body will drastically reduce the likelihood of a virus even 'surviving' in the body, let alone functioning properly... if at all. 

Every. single. human. cell. in the body *needs* iodine .... in one form or another (iodine/iodide) and at one concentration or another.. ...including neurons (ie, past the bb/b).. and, including the pineal gland. 

The body has evolved a very 'evolved' system for handling iodine. there is no real thing as 'excess iodine' in the body.  If the body has excess iodine, it will do the same thing with it that it does with 'excess water', it will simply get rid of it... ...usually simply by urinating it out.

The iodine being in the body... and, i mean *all* over the body... from just moving around through the blood to inside the cell to inside the cells' nuclei ... means that any virus it comes into contact with will be destroyed *by* the iodine.  It's that simple.  Sufficient iodine in the body? Essentially no chance for a virus to make it through and survive the gauntlet of iodine throughout the body.

....check out works by Dr Brownstein, Dr Flechas, Dr Abramson... and others... for elaboration and detailed explanation of this but, in short: with iodine sufficiency, fluoride isn't really a big issue. the body will simply choose the iodine/iodide that it *actually* needs.. ...instead of settling for the readily available fluoride that it *doesn't* to get the job it needs 'a' halogen for taken care of.   .....and, well, it'll 'funk stuff up' in the process.  Fluoride doesn't give a shit if it's bonded to Ca or Ca2... and Ca2 is what we *actually* need to build our cell walls, bone, hair, nails, teeth, etc out of. iodine's larger mass and extra valence shells ..and, well, overall size... make a substantial difference when it comes to proper building, repair, and function of the body's halogen-needs.",2015-08-01 04:08:22+00:00,ctnmhwx,2.0,t1_ctng5be,13030.0,conspiracy

since I'm well past the point of 'social 'couthfulness'' with how much I've written... I figure I'll just 'wear it with pride' and fully send myself over that cliff.

Under optimal conditions (say, Alabama's or Mississippi's climate), aggressive switchgrass strains (for biofuel purposes) have been able to produce 15 (oven dry) tons of biomass per acre per year.

'oven dry' basically meaning 'little to no water weight'.  (I believe it's &lt;15% moisture content by volume, but it may actually be lower).  Much of this weight is carbon.  I don't have the numbers in front of me, but it's &gt;50% carbon by weight.

lets assume that '50%' of that is carbon that can be stored in form of biochar (85% biochar per volume is attained quite often in most higher-quality industrial pyrolysis units, so this isn't far-fetched).

that's ~7+ tons of carbon per acre per annum.  (newer strains are getting *much* better. Blade has a strain of non-GM'd Sunburst strain of switchgrass that's already commercially available and, from what I gather, they're *still* managing to increase yields in the lab.. so, ever-increasing strains/seeds are still to come)

According to [this article](http://www.manhattan-institute.org/energymyths/myth10.htm), humans account for 7 gigatons per year of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.

*Not* taking into consideration that biochar becomes just 1/3rd of the CO2 sequestered due to its presence... and, sticking with a strictly 1:1 ratio  (allowing the other '2/3rds' to make up for 'past transgressions)...

it would take 1 billion acres @7 tons per acre to offset the 7 billion tons we release.
(1 billion acres = 1.52m sq miles)


*Not* really taking into consideration even *more* optimal growing conditions, climates, etc that ... say... Brazil, equatorial Africa, etc would provide... as well the year-round growing conditions of those area...

for reference: there are 640 acres in a sq mile.

from the EPA: 

""There was an 8% decline in the number of acres in farms over the last twenty years. In 1990, there were almost 987 million acres in farms in the U.S., that number was reduced to just under 943 million acres by 2000, and then reduced to 914 million acres in 2012 ""

(~1.5m+ sq miles)

from wikipedia's 'Agriculture in China' article

Although China's agricultural output is the largest in the world, only about 15% of its total land area can be cultivated. China's arable land, which represents 10% of the total arable land in the world, supports over 20% of the world's population. Of this approximately 1.4 million square kilometers of arable land, only about 1.2% (116,580 square kilometers) permanently supports crops and 525,800 square kilometers are irrigated.[17] The land is divided into approximately 200 million households, with an average land allocation of just 0.65 hectares (1.6 acres).


from the huffington post (March 2014)

""More than 8 million acres of China's farmland is too polluted with heavy metals and other chemicals to use for growing food, a Cabinet official said Monday, highlighting a problem that is causing growing public concern.""


([interesting article](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/land-grab/) from NatGeo on African agriculture... with gorgeous pics, as is not surprising fron N.Geo, I suppose, but still worth scrolling through)

that article gives no real hard number for this, nor [does this pdf](https://www.pioneer.com/CMRoot/Pioneer/About_Global/news_media/pannar/Africa_Ag_Opportunities.pdf) really... though it does state that Africa  has 78 million acres currently being planted for maize... it gives no contrast to what percentage of total lands are planted with that for me to get a basis... but, [this popular map](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/true-size-of-africa.jpg) gives a pretty clear image of the planting-potential of Africa... in comparison to the US &amp; China... so... I feel it's probably pretty safe to say 'there's a lot of land for planting switchgrass'


According to [wikiipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Brazil)

Brazil has 65.338m hectares (160m+ acres... or, 252,000 sq miles) of area cultivated

I'm running out of 'give a fuck' for this but... one last one and i'll stfu with this part

from [the NFF](http://www.nff.org.au/farm-facts.html)

""Australian farmers are environmental stewards, owning, managing and caring for 61 percent of Australia’s land mass.""

and, australia is 2.97 million sq miles... '60%' of 2.97m = 1.782m sq miles are 'owned &amp; managed by australian stewards'

saudi arabia, middle east, europe, the 'rest' of s.america... mexico, india, yada yada, blah blah


I suppose my point is... out of the 1.52 million square miles needed to grow switchgrass for the purpose of neutralizing current annual human output of CO2 ... letting the 'other 2/3rds' of carbon sequestered from the addition of biochar to the soil' take care of past emissions...

it's 'doable' :)

and, well, just read the wikipedia... the stuff is [tolerant as hell.](http://www.agmrc.org/commodities__products/biomass/switchgrass-profile/) drought, heat, ... shit soil, etc... the switchgrass alone improves soil quality... .. mix in a percentage of the biochar produced from it each year back into the fields and let them build up... with biochar 'infused' in them.. it'll accelerate it.. 

use the biochar to improve soils currently not farmed (once soils that currently *are* farmed are 'upgraded' first, of course)... and, well, lands that wouldn't even really be suitable for switchgrass can be 'upgraded' to that level... then upgraded farther once the switchgrass is produced.


from that last link:

""In producing estimates of the Carbon Sequestration Cycle, researchers at Iowa State University determined that one pound of switchgrass contains 7,500 BTUs of energy""

so, well, 7 billion tons of switchgrass would be....rounding down to put 1 btu = 1 joule 105,000 terajoules... or, ~29TW.

going with this: 

""In 2012, the IEA estimated that the world energy consumption was 155,505 terawatt-hour (TWh), or 5.598 × 1020 joules. [2] This works out to 17.7 TW, or a bit less than the estimated 20 TW produced by radioactive decay on earth.""

we could *exceed* our energy requirements by &gt;1.6x by doing this... not only *negating* any carbon released from energy sources... as we'd be *exceeding* the energy we consumed in 2012... by &gt;1.6x (obviously less now, and global energy use will only continue to increase regardless of how fuel efficient our cars and light bulbs become) ... but negating all other forms of energy needed period.

so, in short, we could not only go carbon neutral... but carbon negative to the tune of 7b tons a year... in biochar quantity alone... plus the other 2/3rds of atmospheric carbon released during this.

...if we grew switchgrass on the quantity of land that is *clearly* available in more-than-sufficient supply to meet this 'lofty excess'.

Better-still, pelletized switchgrass is already mixed with coal (or straight burned instead of) in coal power plants... it's already gasified along with coal... to produce syngas which is then burned in coal&gt;to&gt;syngas power plants ... and, most (if not all) new n.gas turbines will burn the syngas straight (or blend-with) from pretty much *any* feedstock producing syngas.....

lofty? of course.

unrealistic? ... yeah, of course.

impossible?  probably.. but....

but, there are lots of variables that match up.  land, resources, energy demand, infrastructure that's already in place, etc.

throw a 'moonshot' -style investment behind this and we'd have ourselves not just carbon neutral, not just carbon-negative... but carbon-negative to the point of 250ppm by... mid century, or sooner, if we made a concerted push to do so.

and, at the end of that, ... at the attainment of 250ppm CO2... we'd have billions of acres of pristine Iowa-quality farmland.",2015-07-26 23:17:23+00:00,cth5m5r,9.0,t1_ctgx00y,15099.0,Futurology

&gt; So i wonder if a small scale model of this can be deployed , profitably.

[here's just one website](http://backyardbiochar.net/) showing how to make it in your backyard... on a small scale. [Here's an article](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/01/130129-biochar-clean-cookstoves/) from NatGeo discussing designs where biochar is produced as a *byproduct* of cookstoves... which people presumably use 'every day'.... and, well, the 'countless' 'other benefits' of a clean burning cookstove for health, energy demand, etc.   ...so, that's an example of both biochar-production *and* 'energy utilization'.  (vs the first being more dedicated to *just* biochar production).

There are 'countless' videos on youtube (and sites dedicated to) making larger versions... from using old cans to 55 gallon drums to... well, [industrial models scaling up from 'pallet size'](http://www.allpowerlabs.com/) to ... [shipping container size](http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/09/the-next-industrial-revolution-starts-in-this-shipping-container/) and [this one](http://www.abc.net.au/site-archive/rural/vic/content/2013/03/s3716551.htm) ... so large scale [power plants](http://www.pyrolyzer.net/) and beyond.

'Gasification via pyrolysis' of coal in industrial quantities is how both GE &amp; Siemens get their activated carbon... used by every water company on the planet... and every Brita &amp; Pur water filter out there.  and, well, biomass is also used... there are magazines dedicated to it that publish monthly.  So, this isn't some 'far fetched dream' ... it's based on technologies that've been used for.... ...*centuries* ... ....millenia really.

The idea is just a 'different approach': 'cook materials in an oven' vs 'burn them on a grill'.  ... capture the gases coming off, and burn them as a gas vs... ...shovel coal into a furnace. 

&gt; No problem with complex things, but they do require some serious proof.

I'm not really sure what kind of 'proof' you're looking for.  ...for biochar's capabilities? check out /r/biochar ... I post to it pretty regularly.. less so now, but, it's 'loaded' with articles providing 'proof' ... the IBI, USBI etc's sites are loaded with peer reviews published papers offering 'proof' ... many of which are posted to /r/biochar.  

switchgrass as a crop? switchgrass as a energy feedstock?  It's already an industry.... granted, a really *small* one... but it's growing.  ...and, that's kinda my point: it'd be growing one *helluva lot faster* if it had the capital behind it that China's about to throw behind their version of ITER.  ...a design *known* not to work .... vs an industry that already does, built already technologies that are both 'common place' and have been around (in one form or another) for decades-to-centuries.


&gt; There's plenty of parts in your plan - switchgrass farming , pyrolosis and hydrogen generation, pyrolysis optimization, filtering pollutants, greenhouses, etc. Am i right ?

switchgrass farming: has more or less been covered ad nauseum up to this point.

pyrolysis: used daily in the coal, petroleum, and 'other' refining industries (as well as waste management, etc)

hydrogen generation: this goes hand in hand with pyrolysis when dealing with the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons.. again, something that's done daily on an industrial level

pyrolysis optimization: ...technology's already in use, and advancements in both the science *and* the machinery are a continually ongoing achievement. GE's &amp; Siemens' latest turbines are built around the idea of better utilization of fuel feedstocks... from impurities in n.gas to impurities or inconsistencies in H-content &amp; density from the pyrolysis/gasification of coal. They're the 'flex fuel' vehicles of the turbine industry.... capable of burning a medley of different quantities &amp; qualities of fuel-types, and making nano-second adjustments on the fly to accommodate the next 'fuel injected' gas type from the sensors.

filtering pollutants: have you checked out the tech that's gone into the [latest refineries](http://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/features/feature-top-ten-largest-oil-refineries-world/)? ....things like CERN &amp; ITER, WTC and kilometer-tall building in Dubai get all the attention, but the engineering that goes into these... the *money* that goes into them... these are HUGE! and, well, HUGE feats of man. They bring together some of the most advanced and most complex pieces of scientific &amp; engineering work ever created ... into one site, and push them hard every. single. day. ... society is literally *built* around these.  ...yet they rarely get press coverage. most of society doesn't even know they exist, yet either directly or indirectly reap the benefits of what they put out.  The can cost 10-15 *times* what a WTC or Three Gorges Dam-sized project costs... and (probably for pR &amp; security reasons) are rarely discussed.

Take the [ejection sequence in 'Behind Enemy Lines'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlEt5CNee-0)  ... all the parts tat have to be built, brought together, assembled, checked, tested and retested all to ensure that *just the ejection seat* works... ...let alone the rest of the aircraft... and even the entire battle group behind it... ... but, what fuels that battle group? those people making it to/fro work? the factories where those parts are made? the engineers etc that design them, build them, put them together... the 'countless' that 'serve those' (food, insurance, schools, etc).... ...these refineries are almost single-handedly *that*. *complex*.

Not saying that *you* don't, but no one really *can* conceive of how many 'pieces have to come together' and 'work properly' just to ensure that random lardass can get their McD's cheezeburger &amp; fries.  

So, broken down into pieces, it's not really that much... ...and, essentially *none* of it is built atop anything 'new'... per se.  I mean, even 'biochar' is as old as the oldest lightening bolt started biomass-fire (forest, algae, whatever) that got put out before it completely gasified the biomass feedstock... ....'char' itself? being made on 'countless planets' the universe over.  It's 'natural'... the 'bio' component just puts a nice new marketing spin on it.

'None of it' is really 'out of reach'... that's the whole point of it. It already exists, it just needs to be scaled up.   ...and *scaled* ***up***, it can do a helluva lot more 'good' or 'globally-beneficial-things' a helluva lot sooner, faster, and widespread than a 'failed tokamak design' will be able to accomplish under China's 'accelerated timeline' vs ITER.

easier to reply to

&gt; ""payment for co2 sequestration"" refers to some sort of carbon credit.

um, I really 'don't like' carbon credits. I think they're 'unnecessary' and that they put a real damper on the market. ...though this is obviously just a 'personal issue' and, of course they'd help to 'accelerate' any investments due to their profit incentive.

Carbon credits go under the base assumption that the carbon is a negative with no inherent value. The profit itself can come in when the biochar is sold. The biochar itself has value.  [Here, this page](http://biochar.info/biochar.biochar-overview.cfml) gives an albeit slanted example of the benefits of biochar to crop yields.  Basically, it'd be like '*paying someone*' to use fertilizer.... it just doesn't ... it just isn't needed.  The benefits of using the fertilizer far outweigh the cost of it... otherwise farmers wouldn't use it.   The same applies to the biochar.

That said, the biochar itself has an inherent value (&lt;insert google shopping search results for 'biochar' here&gt;).  That it 'just so happens' to *also* sequester carbon is an 'added benefit' (albeit, one of the major cruxes for my argument in making it).  Biochar, once added to the soil, becomes just 1/3rd of the carbon sequestered due to the addition of the biochar.  So, for every 1lb of biochar added, there will be 2 more pounds of carbon sequestered in the soil *because* the biochar was added... than it if it weren't.  ... via increased plant growth, increased soil microbiota sequestering carbon, etc ..  ...and, the biochar will help to *keep* it there.

I'm not saying/arguing *not* to make it a 'carbon credit' deal... to *not* incentivize its use/production, but... it just farther complicates the issue beyond the obvious benefits of using it (properly).

In all honesty, I actually see biochar as about the *easiest* way to measure sequestered carbon... quite simply because you can weigh the stuff, and, through simple analysis, get a pretty strong gauge on what percentage of its weight *is carbon*.    ...vs carbon offsets by 'planting a bunch of trees' and taking 'educated guesstimates' at how much carbon is contained therein.     I mean, this is a solid substance not much different than 'pour yourself coffee grounds' at your local grocery store in that section where they sell coffee by weight.  It's a pretty straight forward 'sell by/charge by weight' type of thing.

but, I still just don't think it's necessary.  The biochar 'doesn't break down'. It lasts for 100+ years once added (the 'properly made stuff' anyway).  It'd be like ... likening fertilizer to a cheap napkin and biochar to a high quality towel ... it doesn't really break down, and you can 'use it' over and over.   So, once added, its benefits will be continual.  The applicability of this to carbon credits is in that trees will eventually die, decompose, and their carbon will be re-released into the atmosphere.  ... I understand that this is taken into account with the various carbon credit 'schemes' out there, and adjusted for accordingly, but... I don't know, I just don't see where it's needed... ...really.

The farmers that utilize biochar will have a distinct advantage over the farmers that don't.  Much like the introduction of the tractor or 'synthetic fertilizers'. The farmers that use it will out pace the farmers that don't, bring in more per acre off of lower cost of inputs per acre, and with less hassle (ie, more time to be competitive). They will literally be able to secure enough profits that they can *buy* their struggling neighbor's farm and expand their operations... which, by this point would most likely include the utilization &amp; incorporation of biochar.

I also think a 'shift' in the 'value of carbon' needs to be undergone. Right now, by &amp; large, the common view on carbon is that it's 'bad' and 'destructive'.  and, quite simply because, for the most part, it *is*.  ...I suppose.  But, once you can harness that carbon in a productive way, incorporate it into practice, and increase EROEI due to it, it no longer becomes a 'bane' and now becomes an asset ... arguably *needed* to maintain a competitive edge or, eventually, quite simply, just to 'keep up'.

If/when/as graphene is ever figured out how to live up to at least *some* of its 'hype', raw materials will be needed to make it in industrial quantities.  Sure we can get it from 'other carbon sources'... coal, shale, etc, but I see carbon from biomass (basically/easiest, biochar) as being *just as valid* of a source feedstock for graphene production as 'anything else'.   And, if graphene lives up to even *half* the hype, we'll be using it in places that we use both plastic *and* metals.    In everything from keyboard keys to beams in the tallest buildings. From 'automobiles' to coffee cups.

I'm not saying there isn't 'enough carbon out there' to meet the demands ... and, the stuff is most likely 'infinitely recyclable' as it's 'just carbon', so 'new carbon' (from newly made biochar) would have to compete in market prices against 'old graphene' being recycled but... I think the demand will far outstrip the supply for a while once its mass production is 'figured out'.

I was curiously trying to figure out how much iron oxide powder costs for the purpose of [algae](/r/algae) and plankton feeding would be the other day ... for that while '[sequester carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_fertilization) via [iron fertilization](http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/fertilizing-the-ocean-with-iron) deal'  ... iron powder isn't cheap!   I didn't spend a whole lot of time looking into this... (a google-shopping &amp; ebay search is about as far as I made it) ...before I realized I'd have to spend more time &amp; energy on it relative to purchasing 'industrial quantities' of the stuff.... I have *no* idea how 'industrial quantities' of iron oxide powder is sold... how it's transported, etc.   is it sold in 55 gallon drums and transported around on pallets??  seems like it'd be *quite* heavy... is it only shipped in rail car and the like? can you load it into drums then into shipping containers?  it's something i'll 'play around with' when I get bored enough to do so again  (ie, stuck at a 100+ car rxr crossing staring at countless rail cars driving long-named chemicals to the Ford plant.. and curious as to wtf these chemicals are and... what they're used for... and, well, 100 rxr cars in a sound/speed zone can go by pretty slow... it happens 'often enough' so I may find out sooner than later).   

point of that is: nitrogen fertilizer isn't free. Iron oxide isn't free. Activated carbon? I've called around. I've talked to industrial suppliers... called Siemens &amp; GE directly even... (Siemens was the cheapest I could find)... if I signed a contract for one 45ft barge-load a week, every week for a year, I could get a 45ft barge-sized quantity (or, 52 of them) .. *w/out shipping*... for $0.92/lb.   .... plus shipping &amp; transport of the barge from/to the port, and then I'd obviously have to pay port fees, transport from barge to trucks, and then transport in trucks to wherever I'd be storing it.    GE was like $0.96/lb under the same deal, and most of the others were something like $1+/lb.   now, the activated carbon they were selling was 'different' than the 'type' of activated carbon that is biochar... it's made from coal, cleaned, etc ...  has a higher activation, a higher porosity, but doesn't retain the vascular structure of the plant and, ultimately, is anything *but* carbon negative. 

The exercise was. ... 'for academic purposes' (to satiate my curiosity ... as well, understand a market price).  but, my point is: it isn't free. and, it *definitely* isn't something that I'd get *paid* for doing... 

I suppose my point to that is, carbon offsets/sequestration/etc isn't needed.    Another thing about the activated carbon... if I *didn't* sign a 1 year contract, say, i wanted a 6 month or 'just one load'.. the price went up a lot.  The reason for this is because there's a very established market for it.  There's a 'supply &amp; demand' match... same with mining iron.  Iron, for all intents &amp; purposes, is 'infinite' (from a 'practical' human-use perspective)... so the 'iron barons' dictate iron availability (ie, how much they're going to mine) based upon recycling availability and estimated market demand.  (If you get bored one day, you should look into the 'iron barons', it's really interesting to see how that industry works).

anyway, it's a market.  but, a market over a(n) (hopefully)  *in-demand* product ... the more it works, the more success it has, the more in demand it will be, and the more production will scale up to match that demand.   ...since 'energy production' is a 'side product' / 'side industry' of biochar production... *that* market simply helps to 'bridge the gap' in any manufacturing costs.

***
tl;dr: It 'costs too much to make' and has too much of a value to even 'need' carbon credits. though they'd be a benefit incentivizing its production, they aren't needed ... and I'm of the opinion that they only 'hobble' its perception.. tying it more to the 'still on the fence' perception of carbon &amp; climate change... and, discrediting its 'truer value(s)'.

and, it is, in fact, one of the *only* power sources *that* is... and that *includes* fusion.

I like thorium. I like fusion (in form of polywells).  I like fusion in form of a deuterium tritium fuel cycle... *if* under the unlikely chance that a material capable of utilizing the neutrons for propulsion or, at least directing them harmlessly out in space towards something is possible.   

if we can deflect neutrons out the ass-end of a spacecraft... shoot them at the sun as we fly directly away from it towards some Mars or Europa colony we're sending supplies to? bad ass.

but, it's very unlikely to happen.  Nanotechnology won't fix this. Bussard directly addresses that in the google talk when he's 'railing' (taking liberties with my interpretation of Bussard's style of 'railing' with my use of that word, of course) against ITER.

It's a laughable misdirection talents, intelligence, funds, and resources .... and hope.

He was looking for funding for advancement of his Polywell design. From my understanding, the Navy picked it back up and are moving forward with it again... granted, w/out Bussard, and under a very understandable cloak of secrecy...

Imagine what a lining of thermoelectric graphene could do with all of that 'heat' coming from an ITER reactor?

I don't gather that graphene would really help to stem the neutron build-up... though, it *is* the 'wonder material of the future' so who knows *what* they'll manage to get that stuff to do... it may 'eat neutrons' and convert them to Hydrogen for all I know.

but, a great place to get graphene is from a carbon rich energy source... coal, petro, shale, etc are definitely some of those... but, another great one is the atmosphere... in form of biomass.

and, even then, it's an incorrect statement. Fusion *does* have *plenty* to do with carbon... until we're all zipping around in electric cars charged up by fusion reactors made of parts mined &amp; transported from an entirely carbon neutral infrastructure, it has *everything* to do with carbon.

it's supposed to be an 'energy *source*' and you're talking about how it 'consumes' energy.   Granted, I understand what you 'meant' by it, but, in specific context, it farthers my point all the more: it *consumes energy*... that could otherwise be more efficiently allocated towards other ventures... ...ventures that have higher EROEI's ... and more immediate, real world benefits.

copper? arsenic? 'countless other minerals' and necessary elements are 'mined' by plants, algae, etc.  It's just relative to how they materials are refined during the processing.  Granted, I'll give it that 'mining algae energy 'waste'' probably isn't the most efficient way to extract minerals ... from sea water, soil, or otherwise... ...but... this interim infrastructure that I'm proposing (that others are implementing... and I actually am *too*, just on a much smaller scale than 'they' are) has practical application *now*.

again, as stated multiple times on my comments to this post... switchgrass is *not* the best crop for energy density... algae is. but, from a carbon negative perspective, it *is* the best crop (imo). point of that: you could grow a LOT more fuel on a LOT less land... and allow the land corn *is* still grown on to grow much more efficient *just*-food corn crops.  so, overall, would probably net *more* food than before ... not to mention that the switchgrass will grow on marginal lands a farmer would have *no* desire to plow ... w/out spending countless painstaking hours removing large rocks and spreading compost to improve the soil quality... and not have to fear destroying their equipment.

but, at that, Mike's numbers are low.  Throw in greenhouses and emissions recycling and... well, with ITER (even with China's more-aggressive ITER design pace), we're talking 'carbon neutral' by 2050 at best.

but, with a 'simple switch' from planting corn every year (which we do now) to a one time broadcast seeding of switchgrass the same lands (again, once.) we could not only be carbon neutral, not only carbon *negative*, but actually (if utilizing a 'lightly aggressive' -but-more-just-'consistent' greenhouse incorporation)... we could have atmospheric carbon levels to ~250ppm by 2050... and, even sooner if the process is done as aggressively as we switched from 3% ethanol to 7% ... or from 7% to 15% which will most likely happen by 2020.   so, off the *same* amount of energy we've both already committed, and are likely *to* commit (to 15% ethanol) in the next &lt;5 years... we could implement a system that not only restores atmospheric carbon levels to pre-industrial levels (before 2050), but also refills aquifers, rebuilds our soils, rebuilds wildlife habitats, and plus near-perfectly into our already-existing infrastructure.

That's why I haven't mentioned trees *once*, and have mentioned 'fast growth, self seeding perennial grasses' (ie, switchgrass) multiple times. :)

tress *aren't* enough. They take too long to grow, 'last too long', and only sequester carbon during their growth periods.

'Quickly-harvestable' fast growth perennial grasses with a high lignocellulosic value on the other hand sequester much more carbon, and in a much shorter time period ... than trees.

Again, it's been a while since I've seen them and read about the history of vegetation in North America, but... trees are most definitely *not* the (sole) solution... and, really, aren't much of one to begin with, imo.   Don't get me wrong, I like me a good sequoia as much as the next guy... have even ordered seeds online and planted a few in random wooded areas that're likely to remain wooded for quite some time based up urban development patterns in my area... ... but, well, 'just too slow of growth' to make the impact needed.

Besides, to 'bring it back to' more similar conditions to barely-pre-industrial conditions (ie, ~1850 levels), grasses are the way to go.   ...we can 'convert from grasses to woodlands' as we see fit after a while... but, 'to each their own' as far as what farmers do with their fields.

but, well, to address your 'trees' mention... ctrl-f the page, the only time trees has been mentioned *once* in the current 45 comments (soon to be 46 once i post this) is in your comment above.  Quite simply, I'm not advocating 'trees'.... so that part of your comment has no real applicability.

As far as the decreasing CO2 thing...  it's actually 150ppm that carbon needs to be reduced by... it's currently ~400ppm, and to get to pre-industrial levels of ~1850, it'd need to be at 250ppm.

The way to do that isn't by 'forests of mechanical co2 suckers' ... nor by roads &amp; parking lots paved in carbon sucking concrete covered in solar panels...   

it's by growing 'forests' of grasslands of switchgrass.  tens of millions of acres (ie, about on par with what we're growing in ethanol-from-corn now)... and tweaking the pyrolysis such that it produces as hydrogen-rich/carbon-free a syngas stream as possible... ie, producing as much biochar from the pulp as possible.   ... and spreading that biochar (post a pretreatment stage ... remineralization, mycorrhizal fungi, nitrogen-sequestering diazotroph-rich  microbial blends, etc) across the fields we're managing for crop-harvest (be it switchgrass or food crops... or 'other') ... the soil treated with biochar will sequester 2x as much carbon *because* of the biochar ... as the biochar itself ... ....and, it will hold onto it... because of the biochar...

Take it farther... using the inevitable emissions from the pyrolysis &amp; syngas burning, capturing them, cleaning them up, refining them in such that the NxOx's are converted to N2's, O2's, etc...the CO is upgraded to CO2... and the sulfur dioxides and other are broken down into sulfur for... well, plants need sulfur. ... so... with the N2 (what diazatrophs breathe.. and plants utilize), H2O, CO2 (what plants breathe), etc... the plants will grow like crazy.   ... you can pump the emissions into much-faster-growth algae farms, or pump them into greenhouses of switchgrass.

and, i'm talking HUGE greenhouses.  ones that extend the growing seasons to nearly year-round.  Switchgrass is a perennial grass, more than capable of surviving the winter... and growing during it ... ...if the algae strains can be tweaked to provide h-c chains for greenhouse-material bio-plastics... you've got a renewable greenhouse material... either way, the 'waste heat' from the pyrolysis / power plant process can be captured and used to heat the greenhouses (biomass isn't very energy dense, so, presumably, the syngas would either be pumped somewhere to be used (rail &amp; trucks cost too much... watch There Will Be Blood for a dated hollywood-version example of this) ... or, better, burned closer-to-harvest (ie, greenhouses) in decentralized modular power plant designs.   Pelletizing switchgrass is a healthy industry already, but even then, it's still not as energy dense to make it 'greatly economical' vs keeping plants a bit closer.   luckily, the land around power plants is usually pretty cheap... and they're usually pretty remote ... so, it pairs nicely.

at that, it's possibly to get near-100% efficiency in the CO2 sequestered.  The switchgrass grown in greenhouses (I created /r/switchgrass as a place to 'dump' articles-of-worth to while I was doing switchgrass research a while back but... I created it too late, and haven't gotten back into doing switchgrass research since creating it... though, I will again)... ... in trials mostly, has been capable of up to 5 harvests a year. it grows incredibly fast, the heat keeps it seasonally optimal, and the controlled environment keeps the already minimal input requirements of switchgrass all the more minimal.... and easily captured for recycling back into the systems (be it the greenhouse itself, or just surrounding outdoor fields of it).  

and, that's 5 harvests a year of 'prime quality' switchgrass... 12-15ft+ in height per harvest... 30-45 tonnes per year of hydrogen-rich biomass.   The numbers on this... take Cheiky's solve for x talk, apply greenhouses and emissions recycling (ie, N2, CO2 fertilization, and waste heat heating) ... and, you scale this up to the percentage of lands in the US set aside for farming, (ie, not natural terrain), but left fallow to 'heal' from the damage done to them from industrial 'mining' of the soils from previous seasons (ie, growing shitty crops like corn, soy, wheat, etc)... and, on those alone there're millions of acres.  Now, to ... corn &amp; soy grown for ethanol &amp; biodiesel are *also* grown for feed.... so, where they used to be 'one or the other', they're now 'both'.  so the whole 'food for fuel' debate is really... dated... in the case of corn &amp; soy.  (it was an industry manipulation to get tax breaks, grants, and other financial incentives in place for the industry at large, as well for the equipment necessary to separate the corn &amp; soy's 'food &amp; fuel' constituents).    ...unfortunately, growing switchgrass for food means that the debate *does* come back into play.... but, we're also talking EROEI's of 8-10x over corn... and, that's for switchgrass. Algae is orders of magnitude higher than *that* ... *and* the 'waste aspects' of the algae *can* be used as fuel...

I'm not 'anti-fusion', i'm not even 'anti-ITER' (from a purely science perspective), I'm 'anti-ITER' from an allocation of capital, an allocation of 'hope' perspective.

ITER will.not.work.  It will build up too many neutrons and have to be shut down, waited, and then started back up.  It makes no sense. It's a great way to 'bottle up a bunch of awesome scientists' and 'bury them' behind a project so you can keep pumping billions of barrels of oil, and mining trillions of tons of coal. ... not to mention n.gas.    It's a 'b.s. carrot' that will be more-than-rotted on the stick by the time the whole thing crashes into the wall of reality (neutronic fusion won't work ...possibly not even in space... unless a different reactor design is made that somehow manages to direct the neutrons out the backend... and, that's not ITER's design...and, even then, that's just stupid).   

I'm sure a fusion powerplant will require more than '5 people a week' to keep going.  inspectors, security, maintenance teams, etc.  ....not to mention secretaries, accountants, etc all sputtering around in their petro-powered super poopers.  But, carbon negative grassoline? the more they drive, the more they fund an industry that's *removing* carbon from the atmosphere.

Carbon neutrality won't remove the 'countless' gigatons of carbon we're spewing into the atmosphere and acidifying oceans with ... global warming or not, all that carbon still exerts an environmental change vs keeping it in its geologically stable form thousands of feet underground.   

deuterium still has neutrons. it just won't work. ... economically-speaking anyway.  how do you control something with a neutral charge with magnets? it's fundamentally/inherently impossible.  larger shielding buys time, but it also increases weight, and it distances everything even farther from the reactor itself ... not to mention damages equipment along the way... so *that'll* need increased shielding as well.

&gt; but that's probably too much?

 I'm not an anti-lifer. and, all that carbon's great as a feedstock for the office plants :)   ...why? because there will be office plants... because there will be 'armies of people' supporting the infrastructure that supports the plants.  again, office workers, accountants, secretaries, maintenance teams, powerline management teams, grid operators, ....not to mention the fast food chains keeping them fed, the insurance agents keeping them insured. the teachers at the schools teaching their kids while they're otherwise at their 9-5 keeping the planet's lights &amp; a/c on.

Fossil fuels are *not* going anywhere anytime soon... even if Lockheed released a mass produce'able reactor design that could roll off assembly lines as fast as a Maytag or GE microwave. ...and be fueled by tap water.  As such, *removing* the carbon is necessary to keep things balanced... and, again, fusion won't do that.

What you're talking about is decades away. Literally, as stated by them. I hope it's not. I hope I'm totally wrong. I hope there's a giant Gigafactory-sized warehouse of a/c sized units sitting in boxes on shelves waiting to be deployed and installed free of charge Obama-cellphone-style on every house in the planet... with railyard sized shipping container fields of larger units ready to be shipped to factories and walmarts and Targets the world over ... ready to power anything from small office buildings to the largest power requirements out there... and in easily added modular fashion... ...again, powered by water ... ... and, if there are, I'll be the first to admit I was wrong and buy everyone at the bar that night a round of drinks to celebrate the new 'ecoutopia' that's unlikely to spawn from such a thing (more food sources (energy in this case) just spews new conflicts) ... but, I don't think so.  and, to stick with the article's focus, not Lockheed's advanced designs that *are* based upon a tech I was promoting... ITER-designs will not be that design.  and, even if I'm wrong. It will not be that for *decades* to come.

I liked this line:

&gt; In Cheiky’s telling, he’s ..a man who enjoys founding companies but quickly grows tired and moves on.

I gather the same with Cool Planet.  He's already moved on.

There's no *doubt* Cheiky was just pandering for v.c.  I mean, dude's got a 'museum' in his own house of his inventions that he calls the Bat Cave .... right next to his garage filled with collectible cars.   ...dude hypes shit up and rakes in the profits.   smart, if you can get away with it.

but, back to the core science of what's going on vs what he's pumping up...

I, personally, am not a huge fan of miscanthus, which is the 'main grass' (or biomass feedstock) that Cool Planet is going with.  Cool Planet has switched more from a 'biochar-making carbon negative company' to a 'we make grassoline' company ... 'but we can also make biochar to keep with our initial p.r.' 

I like switchgrass. It's easier to plant (broadcast seeding vs planting like potatoes), is much more lignocellulosic (it's a lot woodier... ie, it has a lot higher carbon content... which is 'all' atmospheric carbon converted into plant biomass), ... sure it isn't as hydrogen-dense as miscanthus, but *neither* are as fast growth, energy dense as algae... don't even compare.  , but, both *are* much more hydrogen-dense than corn, for example (ie, the predominant crop-type for short chain hydrocarbons).  If you want to grow for ethanol, grow algae.  At 9'000+ gallons of ethanol per acre per annum, it *far* exceeds *any*thing miscanthus could even dream of.   and, well, the processing of miscanthus (and algae) pretty much release all the carbon back into the atmosphere *during* the fuel-extraction/conversion process. 

If you want to grow a 'still-pretty-damn-dense' hydrogen-rich crop that has all the benefits of switchgrass (easy seeding perennial, native grass, soil builder, 'verocious' carbon sequester'er, that grows on marginal lands... that you can actually plant it on because it requires at least a dude walking around throwing seed over a field, and at most an industrial-sized seed spreader... vs hand or machine planting small miscanthus plants... ie, land that allows tractor tools to get into w/out damaging (rocks, etc)

switchgrass wins.  Sure the higher 'woodiness' of it makes the sugars a bit harder to get to (insert Cheiky's plug of his ultrasonic breakerdowner pretreatment option (or whatever the fuck he calls it in the google talk while he's trying to make it sound complex, 'use big words', wow investors, and rake in profit from selling his shares to them)...   same thing as 'producing quantum wells'  ... yeah buddy, great way to say the biochar has pores small enough to cram electrons into. anyway, that aside)

grind the shit up, feed it through the anaerobic digestion systems used daily for the 7%+ of every gallon of gas ethanol industry we've been building for 20+ years... and, extract the 'easier to get to' hydrogens in ethanol form.   the vast majority of the carbon remains behind in the 'pulp', and, from there, 'cook it' to both extract the remaining hydrogens, as well, to produce the biochar.

Again, if energy-density is what's wanted, grow algae. Switchgrass nor miscanthus can achieve these levels of energy density per acre per annum... but then, neither can corn/soy/etc.  ... which is what we have millions of acres already doing...  so, our already utilized and massively scaled out (and likely to be scaled *up*) infrastructure is highly impractical, yet it's what we've been doing for the past 10-20+ years.  ... to switch to switchgrass is orders of magnitude higher... and to switch over to algae is that yet again.  ...but, if you want carbon-negative, soil building, off of minimum inputs (fertilizer, pesticides, ... water), and still-energy-dense ... while also, again, can't plug this one enough... being a native &amp; predominant grass that most of the species in N.A. evolved for tens of thousands of years around .... habitats, foraging, burrowing, etc... it's just a no brainer.


so, does the tech/science work as Cheiky, a notorious 'hyper', presents it?   Yes.... in a stretch, and, stretch just a bit farther, or even, put into practical application and, no.  but the video is the best singular video out there explaining the process &amp; potential... so it's easy to link to to introduce someone to the idea ... albeit, even *if* done so in a bit of a b.s. way.

That all said, the science? or the core science behind it?  It holds up. Profitably? depends on the tech you're going with. ...but, for the most part, yeah. Trials as well as actual commercial application seem to show that it does.

There'll still be a 'net profit' of energy gained from the system... just lower than off of, say, algae... or miscanthus even.  But, beyond *just* the energy value, there's the biochar component... which is both carbon sequestering *and* soil building / ag-yield-increasing.    And then there's the upgrade of marginal lands that the switchgrass is being grown on... that could/will allow for future plantings of food crops, and provide a return to very-close-to-natural habitat for the native species that used to inhabit those lands in greater numbers than they currently do.    There are multiple benefits from it.... beyond just the energy.

whatever. Personally, I think 'that' entire industry is just getting started. ....and is arguably just ahead or oh-so-slightly behind the algae industry.

Don't get me wrong, i'm a big fan of nuclear, fusion, and the other 'carbon neutrals'... and, energy-density-wise, nothing compares (*to* 'nuclear'), but I think it's pretty clear the path(s) forward(s) are still going to continue to be a 'healthy mix' of different technologies, even if fusion were achieved yesterday and commercial plant designs were already in the final phases of incorporating the necessary adjustment *for* the fusion technologies (not) achieved yesterday....

but, also, I think ITER's a waste, arguably a 'scam', and will 'never work' as a commercial implementation. I 'hope' I'm wrong, but.... with Bussard's research &amp; progress with Polywells a *decade* ago, and thorium continue to march ahead, I just don't see the need. I think China's wasting a bunch of money if they move forward with this. A bunch of money that would be much more beneficial if directed towards other approaches.",2015-07-25 17:30:49+00:00,ctfuckw,5.0,t1_ctfpxen,8836.0,Futurology

Since switchgrass grows on marginal lands not suitable for food crops, is a [native grass to North America](http://plants.usda.gov/maps/large/PA/PAVI2.png) (with relative species from China.. as well, it is easily manageable and *not* an invasive species), helps to build soil with its [very deep-reaching roots](https://il-elgin3.civicplus.com/images/pages/N1279/image007.gif), is a major carbon-sequester'er in its own right, and can help to upgrade non-'suitable' lands to suitable lands in &lt;10 years... and, being a native grass to North America, *is* the grass species that predominately made up the 'grasslands' that native species live within.... so, between harvests, these native species would have habitable lands.

It's extremely drought tolerant, requires very little (if any) inputs (water, fertilizer, pesticides, etc), establishes very hardy root structures that are extremely resistant to most of the 'things' that 'blight' traditional cropland, and has an ever-increasing EROEI due to advanced breeding, and has an [EROEI 10+ times higher than corn does](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/grass-makes-better-ethanol-than-corn/) (that article's dated 2008, and much advancement has happened since, and is still happening)... and allows for multiple harvests per year (with upwards of 15 tons (dry weight) of biomass per harvest) ([pic 1](https://www.qdma.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=17469&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1262880942), [pic 2](http://www.ethanolproducer.com/uploads/posts/magazine/resize/1328-1292434727-300x300-noup.jpg?1429150308), [pic 3](http://msutoday.msu.edu/_/img/assets/2012/switchgrass-harvest.jpg)), is cut, bailed, and harvested utilizing both standard *and* readily available hay bailing equipment ([pic](http://www.reap-canada.com/images/bioenergy/springbales_switchgrass.jpg))...

...it upgrades land, builds soil, retains ground moisture, helps to refill aquifers, reduces to 'negates' groundwater runoff, and, again, requires little-to-no pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizer.... and, with the moisture retention, ability for the roots to dig deeper to find water, and its incredible drought tolerance, all but *doesn't* need water ....

...it's ability to grow on marginal lands means that lands that wouldn't be *thought* of for agriculture can be[ 'greened' and 'dedesertified'](http://imprinting.org/), and in such a way that not only 'more-recently compromised' lands can be 'restored', but even lands that *weren't* heavy carbon sinks can be converted to becoming one  (think a 'green southwest', 'green central valley', 'greening sahara' or even 'greening Gobi desert' (to stick with the china-theme).

so, carbon negative, produces biochar that upgrades farm land and helps *keep* it upgraded, builds soil, provides a common transport fuel (ethanol), produces a hydrogen-rich gas to work with both the hydrogen economy, or just as a n.gas blend/swap, is a non-invasive native fast growth perennial species, helps retain water, rebuild ground moisture, and refill depleted aquifers, reduces runoff, costs very little on seed, is broadcast seeded, and one seeding can last for 'decades' (need to 'replant'? just let it grow to seed and let the seeds 'shake off' during harvest).

the energy sources are storable, it's a renewable energy, energy-dense, it uses solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, hydro, etc, integrates 'perfectly' with our current infrastructure, is incredibly low maintenance, works on marginal lands otherwise set aside to 'die' (kept non-natural by farmers, but also not worked to grow food), allows aging farmers to 'easily work their land', already has government support, ... the list goes on. i think you get the point.

but, again, unlike 'every' other energy source out there, this one's carbon negative .... and, not only 'practical', but profitably-so (there are already businesses venturing into it).

the biochar can be used for soil building, water filtration (both really.. the latter then the prior), feed additive, as a carbon feedstock for [graphene](/r/graphene) production, activated carbon is al*ready* used for capacitors, and advancements in that technology are only increasing their energy density ... but, the gases produced are already easily stored utilizing already in-place (for decades) gas storage facilities...

now, with all of that... is it practical? I could (and have plenty of times) make the argument that it's *im*practical ***not*** to use this as our main, or one of our main energy sources.  The gases that, if released, would make it carbon-neutral, are a carbon feedstock much-needed by the growing [algae](/r/algae) industry ... where companies like Algenol are *buying* smokestack emissions from n.gas and coal plants to pump into their algae farms... and they're producing 10'000+ gallons of longchain hydrocarbons per acer per annum in *their* already-commercial facilities (thus, profitably... CEO claims ~$1 a gallon ethanol and 'the same' for diesel, kerosene, and 'others' ... including 'gasoline' (octane presumably) and jet fuel... not to mention methane, butane, and pure hydrogen.   oh, and they make 150+ gallons of *fresh*water per acre per year from salt water ... and, the 'left over parts' are either seawater-mined nutrients... and they're either fed back into the algae production process *as* nutrients, or utilizable on farmlands to improve the nutritional &amp; mineral density of food crops, as well as blended with animal feed, etc.

so, the pairing of algae and switchgrass ... along with anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, and 'sub-par agricultural lands' go really well together. 


the tokamak design? well, watch the [google talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk6z1vP4Eo8) video I linked to elsewhere in these comments to listen to Bussard not only pitch his polywell design, but 'blast' the tokamak design as being 'a failure from the start'.   as stated in the mission statement (practically), it will *never* work. ... so even if ITER meets or even exceeds all expectations .. by 2035, it'll be *another* 15 years before the science from it could be converted into a commercial reactor design... ..and, with that, it won't.  the tech won't reach sustainable break-even. For fusion to work.. profitably, it requires aneutronic element-forms.

If Bussard's reactor was funded properly back in that '06 talk, we'd already have a functional design (I believe he states 2015 in that talk as being the year it could be achieved) ...and, that's a commercial reactor design. He already *proved* the smaller scale worked.  Max size of the reactor is 15m. you want more power, you build another reactor. modular in design, and can basically come off assembly lines.  ...with a near infinite feedstock for 'practical' planetary concerns (for thousands of years at beyond-current power consumption levels).

but, even then, carbon neutral at best.  badass, awesome 'compact' design. great for lots of things from spaceships to waterships to standard powerplants... large centralized ones *and* 'decentralized neighborhood-sized' ones.  ... but, there's no reason the future has to be ...*or* ***would*** *be*... solely fusion, even if we built functional ones now.  there's just no need to peg things to a singular energy source.

and, even if we completely went carbon neutral today, we'd still be 'screwed'... as in, drastic changes have been and will continue to change our environment for centuries&gt;to&gt;millenia to come. we 'have' to go carbon negative if we want to attempt to mitigate some of the damages we've caused. there's no 'undoing it' or 'reversing' it... but we can get that fossilized geological carbon back in the ground... be it biochar buried really really deep, or simply tilled into the top 6"" of soil.

2041,"This one has a wide definition but... in the higher-quality realm of things, biochar 'should' just be 'char'.... not char*coal*.

if it has 'coal' components in it then it's still potentially flammable as many of the VOCs are still in it.

at home/backyard-made biochar usually does. Most backyard designs simply can't get to the higher temperatures needed to 'burn out' or, more technically correct, 'gas out' the VOCs.   Check out the Rice U link at the bottom of the sidebar, biochar made at 850F and higher are better... with, really, the higher the temp, the better the char.

All the VOCs are 'cooked out', the weaker carbon bonds are gasified (ie, generally less char per load), as well, the char tends to be more active.  so, higher porosity, no VOCs to need to be broken down, longer lasting 'stronger' char, and a higher activation... so, not just 'more holes' but the 'holes/pores' tend to be 'charged more'.

it'd be like having a 1cm cube of char at lower temperatures may have the surface area of 'a tennis court' ..with a bunch of waxy, repelling bio-oils and other volatile organic carbons that're still in there tying/clogging up the pores...   but 1cm cube of char cooked at higher temperature may have the surface area of a soccer field (or even larger), not just have 'more pores', but all the volatiles will've been cooked out... and the whole thing becomes 'more vacuous'.


nothing 'wrong' with backyard char, it just needs time to 'break down' ... and you won't get as much 'bang for buck' per volume added.

There's a really good pic 'out there' somewhere that I've had a really hard time finding in the last couple of years since seeing it but... it showed the difference on roots of lower T and higher T made biochar... with the roots literally *avoiding* the biochar pieces in the soil... ...until the VOCs in it (*finally*) broke down... and then, a few seasons later, it became incorporated into the soil... ....vs the higher-T char had roots growing into it, on it, around it, and was much larger.
 ... similar to a pic like [this](https://woodsend.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/biochar.jpg) or [this](http://earthspringbiochar.com/~earthspr/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BioChar.jpg) ... but, not those, obviously.

but, higher-T -cooked biochar also has drawbacks... if you *don't* 'charge it' or 'load it up' before applying it to the soil, it'll literally suck nutrients into it... and, it may not necessarily make those nutrients bioavailable for the first few seasons ... ...until it, too, has had time to 'age'.   *All* biochar is best mixed with nutrient &amp; microbe-dense compost for at *least* 'a couple of weeks' before adding to soil to grow with... ...or, trying to grow anything out of it.  and, the longer the better... '3-6 months' being 'plenty of time'.    

but, timing is almost perfect: buy/make your char in the cooler months (when you're doing your backyard firepits and such), and throw it in the compost piles.  by early to mid spring, you're gold.

but, think of 'biochar' as being more 'charcoal pencil' than 'charcoal briquette' ... at least the 'better' stuff.    and, no, the higher quality stuff *shouldn't* burn.   though, some people say i'm too critical... I'd rather make/buy higher quality stuff and load it up than make/buy lower quality stuff and... ...wait it out.

2055,"was responding from my phone while interacting with 'snooty people'... but, also, just how i interpreted your reply.

moving on, biochar isn't biocharcoal....   check out the Rice U study linked to at the bottom of the sidebar.  Biochar is, or should be at least, just 'char'... carbon.   the VOC's cooked out.  

They're just two different things.  (bio)char is the structure... 'coal' is/are the VOC's intermixed within the structure of the 'char'.

you don't want these in there anyway.   higher temperatures 'cook' these out, increase the porosity of the char, activate the char to a greater extent, make the char stronger (weaker C-C bonds are broken and the carbon leaves with the rest of the gases) ... etc.

in the end, you end up with either a very porous material... that is virtually 'empty' and that needs to be 'charged' before application to the soil... ....or, some 'charcoal-like', much-less-porous, gob of lower quality char that .... is still very unlikely to catch on fire... ...but, contains enough VOCs to 'repel' nutrients, microbes, fungi, and plant roots away from it until it eventually breaks down.

Still don't think it'd catch on fire.  That thought relative to it just implies to me that you should maybe to a little more reading up on it before trying to use it.  

That said, to answer your question... 'to not *burn*'? ... probably as much as you want.   but, for proper growth? ... you don't really want to exceed 33%.  Some were going as high as 50% biochar... or, mixing biochar with compost 50% per volume ... but, they'd (presumably) let it age for a while... giving the nutrients and microbes and such in the compost a change to 'load the char' before applying it to the soil or trying to grow in it.

but, from most of my reading ... and in my experience... 33% is really the most you'd really want to apply... and, positive results can be seen at below 5%.   i.m.o.   10-25% is the sweet spot.  the longer you have to let it 'age' mixed in with compost, the higher you can go.

but, I'd imagine you'd have to work pretty hard to get it to *burn* ... after the initial cool-down period during the char production anyway.",2015-07-13 13:51:29+00:00,ct1otvc,5.0,t1_ct1aeti,41518.0,BioChar

2124,"&gt; AI means self awareness, consciousness and not a better calculator

have something to back that up?

I believe you may be over-complicating the definition of AI

for example, Merriam-Webster defines AI as: : an area of computer science that deals with giving machines the ability to seem like they have human intelligence

: the power of a machine to copy intelligent human behavior


wikipedia, obviously the standard-setter on everything and never wrong, 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software. It is also the name of the academic field of study which studies how to create computers and computer software that are capable of intelligent behavior. Major AI researchers and textbooks define this field as ""the study and design of intelligent agents"",[1] in which an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.[2] John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1955,[3] defines it as ""the science and engineering of making intelligent machines"".


Wired covered this about 15 years ago... can't remember if it was Kurzweil, quote, interview, or written by... I know he was definitely mentioned in it.   but, it created a differentiation between artificial intelligence and artificial spirituality. ...whereby the intelligence had become so complex that the system was otherwise 'contemplating things' on a spiritual level.

That said, AI has been around for quite some time... and it doesn't necessarily imply 'consciousness' ... at least not in the more traditional perception of the word... as defined by Google

&gt; con·scious·ness
ˈkän(t)SHəsnəs/
noun
the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings.
""she failed to regain consciousness and died two days later""
the awareness or perception of something by a person.
plural noun: consciousnesses
""her acute consciousness of Mike's presence""
the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world.
""consciousness emerges from the operations of the brain""


*My* understanding of it... as it was explained somewhere along my readings.. is that its been around for quite some time.   and that it's basically a system's ability to make independent decisions based on information w/out human involvement in those decisions.

obviously this would fit the 'aware of one's surroundings' aspect of the google definition above... whereby, say, a satellite with a sensor array designed to detected space debris .... ... as well a laser designed to 'zap' the debris to blow it up or otherwise put it into a decaying orbit.    instead of a human deciding for each &amp; every ISS nut &amp; bolt floating around... the satellite uses its sensors to detect analyze, categorize, and otherwise identify the space debris... ...and, then, uses its programming to 'zap' it w/out human intervention, assuming it matches preprogrammed perimeters. 

but, the 'decision' is still preprogrammed... within pre-established perimeters. It is an 'intelligent' decision, but not necessarily one that requires 'consciousness' to do... ...though, it could be argued that the satellite has self awareness due to its ability to detect things around it... but in truth, it's just functioning within perimeters.     AC or AS even would take that to an entirely different level... each about as complex over the previous as AC over AI.  ...at least in my opinion.

AI itself isn't really all that fascinating, systems utilizing it are built &amp; used all the time... AC? I'm not quite sure we've reached systems capable of that ...yet.  and, even if/when we do, it will still, technically, be functioning within preprogrammed perimeters.  At the same time, machines write their own code all the time... most code is machine-written coding at this point ... has been for probably about a decade.  but, again, difference between AI, AC, and AS.

I'm not saying we can't get there, I'm not saying people won't program systems to be as convincing as possible (of their consciousness &amp; spirituality) ... they already are, the tech news covers this all the time... ... hell, i'm not even saying it won't actually be conscious, spiritual, and have a 'soul'... much more simplistic machines seem to have 'souls' or 'essences' of sort... just talk to a farmer about his tractor or a grease monkey about his '68 mustang in his garage... but, imo, I believe that people will have a difficulty of sort accepting AC or AS ... or even AI in its more simplistic understanding... without an organic component to the system.   ...which, well, can easily be involved.  we're building neurons all the time, and we've had neurons that interact with silicon systems for well over a decade... so to build a hybridized system... ...where most of the processing happens on the 'binary-side' of things is *totally* possible... again, I believe we've already done it.. many times...  ...and, even go so far that all the *primary* and '*critical*' processings... ...the ones that the user interacts with that creates the 'convincing consciousness' side of things to the lay person interacting with.... but, again, w/out typing the two together... or, with a removal of the organic, I still imagine people will see it as being, essentially, a machine.",2015-06-23 21:08:44+00:00,csgcdp1,2.0,t1_csfp0ld,48029.0,Futurology

2134,"&gt; I bet I could sit here and come up with some issues that you may not consider a big deal to the environment

oh I have *no* misconceptions that my *main* 'day job' is an environmental disaster; from deforestation to habitat destruction, from run off issues to ... well, really, the list is probably 'endless'.  Methods I've taken towards my 'side jobs' have even led to discussions, debates, even flat out arguments over the environmentally positive merits of its/their environmental benefits.   I didn't realize that that was what was up for discussion here though.

&gt; Everything that needs regulated is regulated.

this statement... hell, even the grammar you used to type it with is... ridiculous, let alone the statement itself.  Let me ask this, if the system *isn't* perfect then how could 'everything that needs regulated' *be* 'regulated' properly? 

&gt; The fact that you think a back yard gardener needs nitrate control shows how asinine your reasoning is.

I didn't say that backyard gardeners need nitrate control.... though I didn't say they *didn't* either. I think that really just depends, ... and depends on multiple variables of which there are countless different variables coming into play here from neighborhood rules &amp; regs to environmental predeterminations. 

What I *did* say was that 'implementations' can scale from the largest farms down to even the backyard gardener. 

I've seen fertilizer put on potted plants on someone's deck drip down through the bottom of the hanging baskets into the streams below (think apartments with balconies that back up to natural wooded areas) and cause an excess amount of growth *in* that 'wild area' ... to the same thing happening to the grass beneath someone's deck in their backyard.

I've seen overzealous yard-owners who want their backyard to look as green as the golf course to which it backs up 'over do' their fertilizations in such that their backyard hill ran its runoff into the golf course pond behind it and create algae blooms like none-other *in* said pond.

Hell, my mom used to clean out the backyard pond deal in her backyard when it'd get too much algae in it, let it drain down the hill in the backyard to the sewer pipe area that ended in some wetland deal that's also back there... ... refill the pond, fertilize the beds around it, then a hard rain come a few days later and all the algae from the pond-cleaning combine with the extra fertilizer she too-liberally applied and... ...that 'wetland' deal down below? blew up with algae, weeds, mosquitoes, and all sorts of other vermin... 

so, sticking with my original sentiment that even an overly fertilized hanging basket to a backyard garden can benefit from properly implemented runoff management.   (my mom's 'problem' was solved by planting a line of 'pond-crops' (read: cattails and others) in a swale that was cut right at the bottom of the hill running the property line... ...that way the water run off would go into the swale, along with any excess fertilizer and any algae from the water she pumped out of the pond... ...and, when that'd happen, whatever she had growing in that swale would blow up...  created a really nice yard effect, so much so that the neighbors next door and the next one down also implemented the same system (or more continued it) and... it created a really nice 'natural' look to the whole thing.   also drastically reduced the 'vermin' that would result from the wetland deal where it ended (mice, rats, opossums, snakes, racoons, etc).

Jump to farming systems.  Before we switched one of our back fields from traditional corn/soy rotation b.s. to switchgrass... and dug swales into it on contour before the switchgrass seed broadcasting... we had a path wide enough for our 4-wheeler to ride between the rows and the wild area next to it.  ... when it'd rain, the runoff from that field would quickly flow over the path, into the wild area... through it, farther down the hill and into that section of the creek below.

It was really sloppy. Algae would blow up in the stream &amp; creek, the area would become super weedy... riding or walking the field would result in countless bug bites hassles and other annoyances.   We kept the path, but dug a three lines of swales in this ~45 acre field...  on contour, the bottom one running just along the edge of the path, and in such a way that it ran at a slight angle so that the water would 'pool' at a low point in the field... 

planted the switchgrass... now it's not an issue.  but, for the first 1.5 years, the swales worked perfectly, the water runoff was drastically reduced as the switchgrass grew and established itself, the water that *did* make it down was caught in the bottom swale, ran to the low point pool and gathered there.... had to put a metal grate over the path so we could ride the 4-wheeler over it w/out getting mud-bath-stuck in it.....  and we planted a bunch of fast growth misc there.

Runoff's not an issue any more that the switchgrass has established itself, the metal grate has since been removed &amp; moved elsewhere on the farm, and the 'pseudo wetland' of runoff has since become a dry area of essential nothingness due to essentially *no* runoff making it there due to the soil absorbing everything that used to.   The woods is no more 'explosive' in growth than any other of the woods bordering the farm... and the stream &amp; creek haven't had algae explosions the same way since.

Point is, from 'industrial agriculture' to 'backyard gardener'... proper runoff management can go a long way.
