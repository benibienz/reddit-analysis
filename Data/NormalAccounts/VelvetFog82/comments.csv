Yesterday I actually got a spool of 24 gage kanthal in the mail from lightning vapes.  I'm blown away that I got that delivered for only $4. Great company.  So now I'm gonna order wire every payday until I have the wire to pull off any wild build.  So I don't know if 22g is considered very easy to work with or not but my first coil came out good and by the 3rd and 4th ones they looked amazing.  It's gives me a huge since of satisfaction knowing ""I built that"" while I'm vaping. I like the looks of the eagle tank. I think it will help more people get into rebuildables which is a great thing.  Teach a man to fish and he will vape no matter what the FDA does lol.

116,After smoking a pack a day for 16 years I had never once tried to quit.  Everyone I know tried to stop at least ten times and never succeeded.  I know all I would do is make myself miserable.  When I started vaping it wasn't even to stop smoking.  It was to vape at work when I couldn't smoke.  Eventually I got to a place that I didn't want to smoke anymore because I could smell how horrible it makes you smell.  So I quit smoking by accident and haven't bought a pack in 8 months and NEVER want to go back to cigarettes.  Vaping should be praised by our government.  ,2016-08-08 17:20:15+00:00,d698hhh,1.0,t3_4wr3po,1896.0,electronic_cigarette

So I Decided to purchase an aspire cf subohm battery and an aspire atlantis tank.  Slowly I started vaping more and smoking less but the day came that I could smell people that smoke and good fucking lord it smells BAD!  I can't believe I smelled that way for 16 years while thinking I was cool doing it.  So now I haven't bought a pack of smokes in 8 months and it's been life changing.

159,"I used the V8 coil at first just because.....its 8 freaking coils at once.  Got 2 weeks out of it before I put a juice in it that killed it.  I blame the juice not the coil.  I believe that if I used the same, cleaner type of juice I usually use it would have lasted 3 weeks or a month. I bought it though for the RBA head and I'm loving this thing!  Took 3 times to wick it without dry hits or leaking but now I'm rewicking every 2 days just to keep flavor fresh.  I suggest using the square sheets of cotton instead of the cotton worm thing that comes  with it.  Maybe I used it wrong but I didn't have much luck with the included cotton.

I've tried twice now and forest time I had try hits and and 2nd time it was leaking.  I'm thinking about using regular sheets of cotton tonight instead of the included cotton worm thing.  I won't give up and I know I'll get it right.  Other than that I've only use the v8 coil at 80 to 120 watts.

1296,Yeah with a higher wattage it will reach your set temp faster.  I have a EVic-VTC mini and I could set my wattage at 75 watts but I set it at 45 watts.  Seems that I get more flavor with a lower wattage.  I guess because the juice Isn't hit with as powerful  as a blast from the coil and heats up a little slower.  Also saves more battery with lower wattage.  ,2016-03-05 00:18:08+00:00,d0o0aid,1.0,t3_490401,553.0,electronic_cigarette

The temperature mode is great for flavor.  If cloud chasing is really what your wanting to do then the cuboid has the power to really get clouds out of things like the TFV4 tank and it's massive coils.  The EVic-VTC mini has great power at 75 watts buy you can double that with the cuboid.  ,2016-02-26 23:50:22+00:00,d0f88s9,1.0,t3_47s8hg,576.0,electronic_cigarette
1353,Well whenever the resistance isn't locked the resistance goes up when you fire it.  When resistance goes up it puts off less vapor.  Example a .5 coil puts off less vapor then a .2 coil.  When  resistance isn't locked your .2 nickel coils raises to  a .5 and it takes longer to pull a big hit.  ,2016-02-26 23:21:41+00:00,d0f78jg,5.0,t1_d0evz7a,16216.0,electronic_cigarette
