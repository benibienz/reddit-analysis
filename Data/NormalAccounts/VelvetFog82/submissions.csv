I have the stainless steel version with number 0124 on the bottom.  Does that means it's the 124th one made?  What number is on the bottom of yours?

This morning I heard ad for Mech Sauce.  Some ads are from Cleveland and some are  just online only so I'm not sure if it was heard on radios in Cleveland but I had to do a double take.

I could use the internet that i'm using right now to find infinite info but I can't but hassled to use my time for that. Ok so I want to spend $20 but i might spend $30 but it would be alright to spend $40 but money is no object...I want it to be the best mod ever. I don't know what temp control is but I need it to do that because i need it. Also If it could check my email and brew coffee that would be good. I'd pay extra for that. I'm gonna need a tank that don't leak because every tank iv'e used leaks and it's the tanks fault, i wasn't using it wrong. I need a tank that wraps it's own coils because i don't have the time to learn how to wrap a piece of wire around a piece of metal. So guys which one is the BEST because i know that their is one vape product that is the BEST. Thanks guys, I need the help because i don't have ANY time!


Sorry guys...I'm just feeling very sarcastic this morning.

I forgot I need a gallon of the absolutely BEST juice in the $3 to $5 range. ",electronic_cigarette,I want the best mod ever made that won't break ever..,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/4qlog0/i_want_the_best_mod_ever_made_that_wont_break_ever/

I upgraded my evic vtc mini to firmware 3.03 to add some sweet logos to it. I'm using my isub G tank with a titanium coil. Innokin titanium coils work great so far but after the upgrade the titanium mode dosen't exist. It cycles from power to NI and next should be TI but it goes to some TCR mode i don't understand. To use my TI coil ive had to go back to firmware 2.0. Has anyone delt with this and know where the hell my TI mode went?

I plugged it into computer and clicked to upgrade to version 3.03. It said upgrade successful. On the upgrader it says Logos. I clicked on logos and now my Evic-vtc mini and then switched back to my google browser to find an image to use and noticed my screen on my vape was black. Now it won't do anything. Can't power it on. Can't get computer to recognize it. I've taken battery out then back in. 5 clicks gets me nowhere. Sorry if this is something simple i've missed but i'm stumped.

Instead of the same of over priced main stream juice I've seen in basically every B&amp;M I've ever been in, I found a large selection of juice made by different companies within my state. I was amazed! I had no idea we had any ejuice companies here in WV. So I made a choice of a juice called Strawesome Sauce by a company called Goof ejuice. I thought it tasted great so i followed them on Facebook and commented on a post talking about how great the juice is. Instantly I got a response and a ""thank you"" for the compliment. Fast forward to today. I'm a driver for work and i was being sent 90 miles away and through the town that my delicious juice was born in. I sent Goof Ejuice another message telling them i had split the 120ml bottle i bought into 30ml bottles to give to some friends and share the goodness. I also asked if they have a store so I could stop by and try all of their flavors. They don't have a store front but they do have a lab and invited me to stop by and see the operations so, i took them up on the offer. I was amazed at how cool the lab was. I had never seen anything like that first hand. I discovered some great juice and made some new friends in my own back yard. This is how a trip to a different B&amp;M took me across the state to see where juice is born! It was a fun experience for me and could be for you too.

I love this community.  It's a great Place for people like myself that love vaping and are happy to be off cigarettes.  Ok enough of the love.  Two weeks ago I replaced my Tesla One mod and isub G Tank with a  EVic-VTC mini and got my wife one also to get her off analogs.  The temperature control works amazing and my wife who is a die hard smoker is loving her vape.  Same day I got our EVic-VTCs in the mail I also got 9 flavors from Mech Sauce so the stock Ni .2 coil saw a lot of juice.  It finally started to put off a week cloud and seemed clogged so I put in the Ti .4 coil thinking it would put off less vapor because of the different resistance.  It's very flavorful and vapes great buy my question is to people that have had this set up for a while.  Which coil do you order as replacements.  Is one known for better flavor?  Better battery life from the Ti because of resistance?  I'm at a loss for which to order a pack of.  Sorry this was so long and thanks for your time.
