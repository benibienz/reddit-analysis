Fast forward to 9:57, on the night battle at the boss. Myoukou cut's in and deals a little over 130 damage, BB princess doesn't cut in, and Ooi takes her out with her DA.

9:58.

At the results screen, I prayed. I prayed. I sincerely prayed for Roma to drop. I didn't see the ""long loading"" because I was using Teamviewer, so I thought I had gotten something I already had.

9:59, I see the glorious holo background and GLORIOUS ROMA'S DAMN SPRITE. 1 MIN LEFT BEFORE THE EVENT ENDS, IT WAS LITERALLY MY LAST E-5 RUN, AND THE MYTH WAS BUSTED. AN ANGEL HAS GRACED FROM HEAVEN.

I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH.

I'm still planning on leveling up Suzuya, Kumano, Chikuma, and Akatsuki to at least 65+ before the event starts, and Yamashiro to kai2.

Equipment-wise, I have 4 reppuus and 7 shiden kai2s. ",kancolle,[Help]Is my fleet prepared for Summer Hard? Advice appreciated!,http://www.reddit.com/r/kancolle/comments/3d8wla/helpis_my_fleet_prepared_for_summer_hard_advice/
