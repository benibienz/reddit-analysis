30,"I wonder if it does. If you take something like Arcane Missiles for example, the missiles won't activate deathrattles until the spell effect is over, even if it ""killed"" something on the first missile. With this logic, Ruination would only destroy the first set of minions and trigger any deathrattles only after Ruination is complete. :)

Battlecries &gt; Secrets &gt; spells &gt; Deathrattles.

&gt; Does the card have to be impossible to do physically?

No, but not pratical. how would a card like [Renounce Darkness](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/6/6d/Renounce_Darkness%2833136%29.png?version=dbe991aa2b7bb6b49b3beccb066d064e) work in a physical card game? Do you need to run around with every class cards just to play that card? You would also need to pause the game in order to shuffle in the new class cards.

[Animal Companion](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/e/e1/Animal_Companion%28578%29.png) is also a good example of a card that wouldn't work.

But that is just the thing. When you discover something, it's supposed to be a tactical choice. Do you pick the minion with better stats, or a minion with a special ability.

* [Golden Monkey](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/6/65/Golden_Monkey%2827212%29.png) is often better than [Druid of the Claw](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/6/69/Druid_of_the_Claw%2845%29.png), [Infernal](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/3/39/Infernal%28121%29.png) and [Bloodhoof](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/1/18/Baine_Bloodhoof%28359%29.png)

117,"* **Naga Hunter**: Pretty cool. It's a weaker Flame juggler, but can be strong if left alive.

* **Naga Warlord**: Giving your minions with 3 or less attack a buff is very interesting. I almost think that the Warlord should have less stats just so that you can make the ability more awesome. Like this: 

5 Mana 3/5 Your minions with 3 or less attack has +2 Health.

* **Dragon Clash**: I'm not sure about this one. It's a very cool Secret, but since it's so random and can be played on turn 1, it can create some very unfun games. For instance, if you play this turn 1 and get [Chromaggus](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/1/10/Chromaggus%2814451%29.png) and your opponent get's something like [Twilight Guardian](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/5/56/Twilight_Guardian%2822351%29.png), you instantly win the game. I like wild cards, but that's to wild. :)

* **Arthas**: Speaking of wild, we got this guy. The Lich king is pretty crazy but I suppose it's balanced because Arthas needs to die first. My only critique is the choice of class. To my knowledge, Arthas was a Paladin that was later turned into a Death Knight. While it's true that Paladins and Deathknights share some features with Warriors, they are still three completly different classes.

And why copy your own minions? Isn't the Priest thing to copy your opponents stuff? Anyway, moving on.

* **Hallazeal the Ascended**: I like it. It's a defensive 5 cost minion, but more exciting than Sludge Belcher or Healbot. It should also work very well in Shaman as they have a bunch of cheap spells and access to the occasional Spell Damage Totem. Will this make control Shamans viable? I hope so.

* **DOOM!**: A bigger [Twisted Nether](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/c/ca/Twisting_Nether%28398%29.png) that might actually see play in the Renolock deck. Other than that, I don't think it will be enough to inspire a new control Warlock deck.

* **Infested Tauren**: I don't think this will be that great in constructed, but it should be a decent pick in Arena because of it's overall stats and Taunt. Heck, it might even become better than Piloted shredder if the Arena meta becomes faster. (almost there though.)

This would be fine as an ongoing effect similar to [Brann Bronzebeard](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/3/3a/Brann_Bronzebeard%2827214%29.png) or [Mal'Ganis](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/5/52/Mal%27Ganis%2812294%29.png).

* **Ner'zhul**: Once again, I don't think adding more to a card makes it better. Both the Battlecry and the Inspire is fine, but when you put them togheter, it becomes a mess. Also, I don't think Ner'zhuls ever was a Death Knight as shown in the art. I just remember him being trapped in the Lich King armor until Arthas equipped it and Ner'zhul took over.

* **Garona Halforcen**: The biggest problem here is that the ability lacks that Legendary feel. I am not talking about quantity here, this card would not become more Legendary if you added a Deathrattle and Enrage to it. A Legendary needs to stand out as a unique and/or crazy like [Reno Jackson](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/1/14/Reno_Jackson%2827228%29.png) or [Aviana](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/d/d7/Aviana%2822325%29.png).

* **Highpriestess Ar'lokk**: I like both the Battlecry and the Deathrattle, but I think it's healthier for a card to have a single ability rather than two different ones. Pick one and make it the center of the card.

Also as a side note, the Deathrattle should probably say: Summon a Panther Aspect as a minion can't transform when it's dead. :)

* **Hight Priest Thekal**: Cool card and I think we can make it a bit shorter if we gave it the [Toshley](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/6/69/Toshley%2812225%29.png) treatment. How about:

**Battlecry and Inspire**: Summon a 5/5 Stranglethorn Tiger. 


* **High Priest Venoxis**: I'll be honest, I didn't play much of this raid when I played WoW, but I am certain that this guy didn't have any Paladin powers. :)

It's also not really great to give a player a Secret when the opponent also knows what it is. Secrets are supposed to be, you know, Secret.

What would I change? Since his name is Venoxis, how about a poison or Snake theme?

**Battlecry**: Add a random Poison card to your hand. (Poison cards are the following: Deadly Poison, Poison Seeds or Poisoned Blade. )

OR

**Battlecry**: Summon three 2/3 Emperor Cobras.


* **High Priestess Mar'li**: I like it. Much like High Priest Venoxis, this one is simple to understand and that's good enough for me. Next! :)

* **High Priestess Jeklik**:This also has a bit to much text for Hearthstone, imo. I would shorten it to something like:

**Battlecry**: Silence all enemy minions. For each Silenced minion, summon a 1/1 Bloodseeker Bat. 

Side note, I think the Human form is great.

* **Bloodlord Mandokir**: I understand the idea behind this card, and this is about the only fight that I know from heart. Sadly, it doesn't translate well into Hearthstone. It's just to complicated. While I think the ""Watch"" think is important for this boss, I would rather say that the Raptor is the iconic thing in this fight. I would keep much of it as you have, but maybe state it like this:

**Battlecry**: Summon a 2/3 Ohgan with **Deathrattle**: Give Bloodlord Mandokir +4 Attack.


* **Jin'do the Hexer**: Many things here that will cause a new player (or even a veteran) to scratch his head. What is a Brain Wash Totem? What happend to a hexed target? What does Shade of Jin'do? (Hehe, word play.) Still, pick something and focus on it. Random stuff is fine, but make it so that the player knows the stakes. I'm not sure what I would do here, so I will go with something crazy:

**Battlecry**: Transform all other minions into 0/1 Frogs with **Taunt**. 

* **Hakkar the Soulflayer**:  I'll be honest. This card made me dizzy. There is so much going on that both players will have to spend the rest of the game trying to understand what it does. Heck, I'm still not 100% sure. Anyway, as I see it, this cards uses two themes, mind control and board clear. I went with mind control, how about:

It's for this reason why Taunt and Winfury works so well with Enrage. (since they are constant.) But Stealth is not constant. In theory if a minion had ""Enrage: gain Stealth."", that minion would remain in Stealth for as long as it was damaged. In short, it would break the mechanic.

I suggest that this part was changed to ""Whenever this minion survives damage, gain Stealth."" This way it would be very similar to the original idea, but it would not break the game. It would also be viable to make it Stealthed from the start and just make the Enrage summon Unstable Ghouls.

I think it's important to remember that a class isn't just a box with random cards, it's a theme. Paladin is about tokens and buffs. Mages is about spells and freeze. Druid is about ramp and beasts.

239,"A ""quick"" run down on my opinion:

* **Hero**: Darion Mograine is a fine choice for Hero, but it feels a bit wierd for him to have the Lich King has his minion. (Lore wise it should be the other way around.)

* **Hero Power**: It's like you said, everyone and their mother has used this Hero Power for their Death Knight. I personally think it's to complicated for a Hero Power and I hope Blizzard doesn't decide to go down this road.

* **Keyword**: It feels a bit shallow imo. A keyword is supposed to be used in many different ways to create a depth of possibilities. Compared to Divine Shield that can be used both offensively and defensively. Leech is also usless on small minions (Such as your Hero Power) while Divine Shield is good on any minion.

* **Weapon**: All fine in their own right, but nothing special to comment on. Carry on!

* **Spell**: Some great spells here. I really like Death and Decay and I really dislike Army of the Dead because of the Hero Power. 

* **Minions**: Cool minions, but I'm definitely noticing some collisions here. So you want your minions to die, but you also want to keep them alive with Leech? I'm glad that there is some synergy with your Hero Power here, but not nearly enough imo.


**Final thoughts**: Some good ideas here, but I think the class is flawed. The reason it feels unstable is because your Hero Power and your Mechanic has 0 synergy, and they will often interfere with your cards. I think it could be interesting to make a class based around the balance of life and death, but then the class need to reflect and acknowledge that goal.

I'm trying to find a good advice how to refocus your deck, but all I can say is this: *Decide what you want your class to do. Find a focus and stick to it. Look at classes like Rogue and Paladin.*",2016-02-07 19:56:29+00:00,czrcb1h,1.0,t3_44liid,24808.0,hearthstone

261,"&gt; What people often don't realize when they fallaciously justify op cards by saying that class cards can be better neutrals is that all currently existing power creeped class cards are better versions of bad cards.

It's not just Neutral vs Class card. Some class cards are stronger than other class cards just because their class is different. Warlock is a class that suffered most from this because their Hero Power is so good.

&gt; Having a powercreeped version of a blackwing or shredder however, who are actually good cards, absolutely is not.

Sure, Shredder sees play in Mage, but Shredder is op for it's own reason (Needs to be killed twice and it's a Mech) and not a complete replacment for this card. If anything, it's Fierce Monkey that you should campare it with. That card is really strong, but if you removed the Taunt, what kind of stat would it have? Most likely a 4/4 or 3/5.

In a way, that can also be said about the Mage class. They don't have any buffs or heals, so it makes sense that cards like Water Elemental is a bit over the top. Tempo mage will have a great time with a 3 Mana 3/5, but you can be assured that it will stay a 3/5 just as Water Elemental will stay a 3/6. (Same can not be said with Paladins Shield bot.)

264,"Yeah, it sucks when you have worked on a great responde only to have it deleted/disappeared. Still, you brought some great points and I agree with most of it.

To short it up - *8 stats for 3 Mana is the base line. If it wants more, it will need some sort of draw back.* Agreed. It's for this reason Yeti is 9 stats for 4 Mana etc.


But I still can't see why a 3 Mana 3/5 must be op in Mage. While random, Animal Companion will also give this value and it has even better synergy with its class.

Instead of having a small bonus like **""Deathrattle**: Give a random friendly minion +3 Health."" Why not just give it +1 stat? One could also say that the bonus is the change of type (Making it a spell.), but I would say that other classes has thing like that to. For instance, Druids have a ""better"" Spellbreaker, aka Keeper of the Grove, and Priest have a ""better"" Yeti, aka Lightspawn. The class cards seem better, but they are just more fitted for their class.

So what am I getting at? I don't think this card will breaks the game. Conjure won't always be better than Spider tank or Ogre Brute for the same reason Keeper of the Grove won't always be better than Spellbreaker.

I have also experienced being overkilled by 10 dmg. In truth, dealing 30 damage is easy as aggro unless the opponent have a bunch of heals, taunts or aoe. It's not easy to have 2-3 answers to aggro as control with just 4 cards in your starting hand. 

I agree that the game was build around 30 health, but I also think the game has evolved since then. I'm not saying that the power creep has started, but we might need 40 health to keep up.

The Weapon is very interesting, but I wonder how it would work in action. Weapons are often used to remove small minions or used with other cards to take down lager ones.

* **Target Melting**: A small upgrade, and it's one of the better ones here, but I would not pay 4 Mana to get it.

* **Melting Impact**: Same as above. You are paying 4 Mana to deal 1 damage to the enemy Hero.

* **Melting Cast**: ~~I'm sorry, but I don't understand this one. It's a bit late here, but I have never heard of any ""Hero Power damage bonus"" in Hearthstone. Not much to go on here, but to deal 2 damage for 3 Mana is quite bad.~~ Just learned that Fallen Hero exist, silly me.

* **Increased Meltdown**: Problem with this is that it's situational. Maybe in 1/3 games you will face a minion with Divine Shield, and then you need to get lucky to Discover the right Hero Power. It's possible to play two of these and still not get that Hero Power.

* **Meltdown Fury**: Come on. This is not even strictly better than your default Hero Power, and you have to pay 3 Mana for it.

Make them stronger/cheaper. All of them. Right now you are paying for something that might not even be beneficial. Has this card the same power-level as a Water Elemental? As a Fireball? No, not even close.

While this sounds great in theory, history has proven this to be more of a problem than a solution. Take World of Warcraft for instance. When you defeat a boss as a team in that game, there is sometimes talk about who should get the loot (Weapons and Armors etc). There are many ways to distribute it, but a common way is called [""Loot Council""](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Loot_council)

With this system, a few peoples in your group/Guild will decide who should get the loot (Often the best players of their class). In more professional Guilds this will not be a problem, but when less organized groups try this (For example 12 people on reddit.), they will often make decisions based on friendships or personal bias. (As people are already doing)

Don't get me wrong, I am sure there are more than 12 honorable guys or girls on this reddit (I'm one of them I would say.), but to put togheter a council for this is just to much.

It basically locks 28 mostly balanced cards behind a keyword. That's like removing an entire class! If we removed the Druid class but added a keyword that said ""Add a druid card to your hand."" That would be silly, right?

We are all different, Some can make great cards super fast, while others (like me) needs more time. The problem was never how fast the card was submitted, but that you were able to upvote it immediately. If people want to submit something on the first day, then that should be seen as commitment, not an advantage.

&gt; **Lengthen the contest period to two weeks.** Again, this addresses the 'early bird' problem and ensures that even newer submissions have time to be seen.

While this could work in theory, I think it would just lead us to the same problem. If the wait period was 2 weeks then I would still be punished for submitting the last few days. (Less exposure etc.)

&gt; **Allow only one submission per user.** Three was fine when this subreddit was smaller, but now the weekly contests are quite cluttered; cutting down the number of allowed submissions will help ensure that everyone's work is considered.

I agree. Quality over quantity has always been my saying. Since only one can win, there is no real reason why you should need more than one submission.

&gt; **Move to a two-stage competition.** A two-stage competition that first whittles the pool down to, say, ten finalists that the community then picks from could fix a lot of the problems people are bringing up here. Finalists could be the most popular submissions, or cards picked by a rotating panel of judges, or a mix. Judges could be moderators or past winners.

While also a great idea on paper, this might not solve the main problem that I have, aka early bird submissions. It would still favor people that submit early as they often gain more exposure. It could lead to having the 10 finalist decided the first or second day, as no one wants to look through 50 submissions on the last day.

*True, but saying that a shotgun is equal to a bow in closequaters is just silly. I'd say you definitely lose if you are in a bad position, this is important for almost any game, and this one included.*

&gt; His dash resets after a kill, meaning you can dash in then try to kill with melee attack or some shuriken, move around the enemy team to survive, get a reset go back in. Looks very interesting to me.

*Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that his kit works, and people will find some joy with it. But this hero could have been something more than just a melee/range hybrid.

*While Reinhardt might have abilites that promote pushing, his kit is designed to have a weakness - his back. I think you can add almost anything to a game aslong as there is reasonable counterplay to it.*

&gt; Imagine if we make a melee character in COD that repels bullets and 1 hits kills anything he dashes through. That would make no sense.

*But in that case, the melee isn't the problem, the dash/repel is the problem.* **Melee wins in melee and range wins at range.** *If Reaper attacks Hanzo in melee, Reaper should win. But if they are both at range then Hanzo should win.(with equal skill)*

*When you remove the melee/range element from the game by giving melee heroes powerful dash moves, the balance is removed and range becomes useless.*

&gt; You can still use melee attacks, you have a dash melee ability, good mobility, ability to repel some stuff and ranged attacks to kite back or support allies.

*If I didn't know what you were talking about, I would persume you were talking about Lucio. And that's the other problem, on paper, he doesn't sound like an offensive hero. He lacks the tag ""Get in there!"" that all the other offensive heroes have.*

&gt; They still managed to fit in 2 melee heroes, even though it's not his primary attack he is still a melee character.

*Don't forget Winston and Torbjörn! They don't really have any melee abilites but since Torbjörn has a wrench and Winston has a melee ultimte, they should count. :)*

433,"&gt; If you make up for the fact that he is melee by giving more damage or hp and mobility, it causes huge imbalance in a lot of cases.

But isn't that what Overwatch is in a nutshell? The reason why most  Hereos are interesting is becase they feel overpowered. Bastion feels op as a turret, Widowmaker feels op as a sniper etc.

**I think the reason Genji was op was not because he was melee, but because his kit was op for a melee.** Hear me out:

Since he is melee he is susceptible to be kited/killed at range. So what happends when you give him a skill that deflect range attacks and a skill that closes the gap on range enemies? He loses all his weaknessess.

Also, if they didn't like melee in fps (even though its has been done in other games.) they could have just given Genji a unique 3rd person view. It would not break the game and it would be kind of awesome.

So in short, give back his melee, but rework his abilites.

**Battlecry**: Does something when you play it from your hand.

For instance, does it trigger from Freeze on hit? (Freeze is an effect?) or is it just effects like Battlecry and Deathrattle? **What is an effect?** What is the reason for it to be a keyword if you can't instantly tell what it does?

It's also a problem that there is a restriction on it, right there in the description. This gives me the feeling that the designer doesn't want the players to experiment with it because it doesn't work with other cards.

I don't expect much from this, but I just wanted to show that some underplayed cards are fine the way they are. So I hope not to see any *Ice Chickens* running around

The second part just makes it really weird. You don't really gain any value since you will lose something else. And who is it that loses health? Is it the minion that is summoned? Your Hero? Does this mean that Dragon themed minions with less than 2 health can't be summoned? What if you had two Dragonriders, would you lose twice the health? So many questions.


Blizzard said at some point that a player should just have to take a quick look at a card and instantly understand what it does. I am not an expert at this, but something like:

Your minions in hand are now Dragons but cost (1) more to summon.

480,"Thanks! I love indepth comments. Now let's see here..

&gt; Spirit Walker: This is too good. 

I had a really hard time distributing stats to this one. I did some math, and it seems you get on an avarage 4,5/5,1 from the summon. That's a 8/9 worth of stats. So a 8/9 for 7 might be a bit crazy and I should have probably made it 8 mana.


&gt; Lightning Shield: I like the idea of a defenside option for AOE minion buffing, but I think you should take away 1 stat point. Druid's savage roar costs 3 as well but only gives 2 points to each minion.

Yeah, my plan was to find some sort of middle ground without trying to take someones place. As for Druid's savage, it will also give your Hero +2 attack, making it never a completly dead card. I sort of don't have a problem with Lightning Shield as of yet.

&gt; Mind Flay: This is a neat card. However, I think it currently costs 1 too much. A 2-cost version might see some use. 

I'm afraid it would be to punishing, minions have often more than one ability now a days, just look at Sunwalker:

**6 mana 4/5 Taunt. Divine Shield.**

It goes from being the bane of Priest to a joke with Mind Flay.(Even worse if it cost 2) I kind of feel that Pain and Death should be seen as the main removal.

&gt; Earthquake: Neat take on the much-desired Shaman Earthquake card. I think this too could be lowered in cost. Maybe 7 or 6. I'm comparing it to Vanish, here, which costs 6. I just don't feel like the chance to put it in the deck is worth 2 mana more. That could actually hurt the user a lot.

Once again, I tried to avoid trying to steal spotlight. The two cards I had in mind was Vanish and Twisted Nether. I don't know, man, I am kind of drawn in diffrent ways here. At one hand, this would be Shamans big spell. Think Mind Control, Lay on Hands and Pyro Blast. But on the other hand, it might not see play with such a high cost.


&gt; Chaos Bolt: I sort of want this to be a 5-cost. You could theoretically play Dark Bomb, then two of these bolts, and deal 19 damage in one turn WITHOUT spell damage.

In short, it's the Doomguard of spells. :) I also dislike devastating burn cards, but I think it would be hard to sustain such a burst when your entire hand is discarded.Though, It could/should be a bit worse since it belongs to Warlock.

&gt; Curious Cub: I think this should cost 6. Beasts are generally cheaper. Spiders, boars, bears...it wouldn't cost a lot to play a whole bunch. Maybe mess with the flavor/art/name though. I don't see what a little tiger cub would be a 4/4. The full-fledged tiger is a 5/5...it just doesn't make sense to me.

It was my attempt to fuel some more Beast Hunters, but I can agree that it's a bit Cheap. Still, playing 5 beasts just to make it free feels like you are going to get punished hard by aoe. Could be crazy with Unleash the doggies, though. As for the art.. I'm not that creative. :)

481,"&gt; You're trying to tell me Chillwind Yeti is stronger than Voidcaller, for example? Or Goblin Blastmage? I'm sorry but I simply don't agree.

* Let's start with **Voidcaller**. First off - a 3/4 for 4 mana is not really good, this is easy. But the power in this card lies in a Deathrattle. The ability to summon a random Demon from your hand is quite good, but it isn't OP. It isn't instant, It can be ignored and it can be silenced. I would compare this more to Piloted Shredder, and that card is neutral and a Mech. Sure, it's crazy when you get malganis or Doomguard from your Voidcaller, but they must be in your hand at that time. I could go on, but I will leave it at that, for now.

* **Goblin Blastmage** is really good. It's both strong and reliable. At worse it's a 5/4 for 4 (Good) at best, it will wipe a small board and give you huge tempo.(Godlike) few cards have this power on their own, and it's really card to compare it.

Of course there is exceptions to this, Druid of the Claw is stronger that Fen Creeper because Druids are supposed to have the biggest creatures. But in other cases, class cards are mostly just diffrent. 

Lightspawn and Anub'ar Anbusher are both a 5/5, but their ability can sometimes be a weakness. Dunemaul Shaman gives you Overload and has the 50% Ogre ability.

In most cases, these abilites are there to synergies with their class in some way, but isn't always the best pick.

496,"&gt; Getting giants for 0-4 mana requires you to put yourself in a dangerous position at less than 15 health.

It's possible that you have less health at turn 9, it's also easier for the opponent to kill you at that point. Of course it also possible that your deck is build around this fact. 
As for Handlocks, they are rarely in any real danger as there is always the risk of free taunted giants.


&gt; It would be an auto include in every single non aggro/control deck.

I'm not an expert, but isn't every deck a sort of Control or Aggro? But if you mean ""Control control"" as a viable deck for this card, well that was the point. Still...

 
Would **Druid** run it? They have enough good late game drops. Hey, most don't even run Cenarius or Malorne anymore. 

**Priest**? As far as I know they are still plagued with being to unreliable.(Need good draw.) Is that really what you want when going for the ""real"" late game. 

**Paladin** might be able to do something. Though they lack any real synergy, they have the tools to make it to the end. But with their current decks, it's hard to get on top.

497,"Thank you. I respect everyones opinion, but it's nice to see someone that doesn't freak out at first sight. :)

&gt; if the meta was ever so slow that you could actually afford to spend 9 mana just summoning a minion for the body - this would probably be an S+ tier card.

That's indeed what I went with. You won't finds a bigger minion to play by the stats alone. But since it cost 9 mana and does ""nothing"" when played, it will be hard to get the full value out of it. And if it isn't taunted, it's just a 8/8 for 9 most of the time.

But just like you said, if the game slowed down, this could be better than other Legendary minions of the same cost.",2015-06-25 11:40:04+00:00,csi4hgi,3.0,t1_cshzs6d,18652.0,customhearthstone

Unless you want to be boring and just pick the vanilla cards in the game (Jungle Panther and Ironfur Grizzly) here are the tokens:

It's hard to make a card to rival the other Druid 7 mana minions, but let's give it a go! 

A common trend for Druid cards is to choose between offensive or defensive. In this case, our token will either guard you, or add more damage.

499,"&gt; Not OP at all. An 8 mana body that spawns a 7 mana body when killed. Clearly not OP.

Well, it seems you are not the first to think so. I just don't see why this is such a big deal? 8/8 Giants for 4-0 Mana doesn't break the game. 

If there was a time when everyone played this card, Mage, Shaman and Rogue would see more play. 
Just like Dr.Balanced, people will react and figure out counters. Even from an Arenas stand point, this card isn't impossible to get around.

Don't get me wrong, I love to discuss card balance, but it would be nice to know *why you think it's OP?*",2015-06-23 17:22:33+00:00,csg3b6r,3.0,t1_csfxk7j,9037.0,customhearthstone
500,"Sorry, I still don't see it. :) If I drop something that cost 9 mana, I expect it to have impact, game deciding impact. Sure it's hard to remove, but that's not really the way to counter it. It gets owned by faster decks, much more than most cards. 
Also, give the slower decks some love. Except for Druids, all they got is Ogre and MAX as strong late game. (Arena)

And yes, late game decks are supposed to win late game, who would have thought? :)

* Sneed's Old Shredder is on avarage a **10/14 with a nice ability for 8 mana.**
