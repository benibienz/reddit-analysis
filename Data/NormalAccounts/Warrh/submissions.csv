Once again, I want to thank everyone that participated and I hope you'll take another shot at this weeks competition.
____________________________________________________

For this week we've got a very interesting theme that was inspired by some of the submissions during the ""simplestone"" competition. The theme for this week is called ""Break the Rules"" the rules are a bit unique. You need to create a card based on any of the previous themes (you can find most of them [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/wiki/competition_winners)), but you need to **""technically"" follow the rules**. For instance, if you decided to go with ""[Simplestone](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/58tfl2/weekly_design_competition_113_simplestone/)"", you could change the text size of your card to make more words fit into one line. In short, **you must cheat a weekly theme without breaking any mentioned rules. Bending the rules is the key to victory!** 

I might have to re-edit this in the future to make it more clear, but I'll leave it at that for now. If you got any questions, feel free to send a  [message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcustomhearthstone) and we'll try to clear things up. Anyway, make sure to look through all submissions and upvote those that you like. Break the Rules will open up on **Monday at 18:00 PM GMT+2 and will stay open until the end of next week**. The winner will be awarded the ""Winner's flair"" and can also choose the theme for the following week. Good luck!

Sadly, I could not get in contact with last weeks winner, so we'll have to improvise a bit. Until further notice, this weeks competition is called **Simplestone**. You're tasked with creating a card of any sort, but it can only have **one line of text at most for its ability/effect**. Here is a few cards that are considered okey: [Fireball](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/d/d5/Fireball%28522%29.png?version=52dbc18ad888393cca20c021b812efe3), [Fiery War Axe](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/8/84/Fiery_War_Axe%28632%29.png?version=7531cbb0b558ca3b017d75ccd060182d), [Dust Devil](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/8/84/Dust_Devil%28129%29.png?version=a273436de6782d5d65f8cf3d1349eccc).

For this competition, flavor and theme will be extra important in order to cover your cards simple nature. Make sure to look through all submissions and upvote those that you like. **Simplestone will open up on monday at 18:00 PM GMT+2** and will stay open until the end of next week. The winner will be awarded the ""Winner's flair"" and can also choose the theme for the following week. Good luck!

Just as the title said, when it comes to unique abilites in this game, it's not easy to find them. In most cases it boils down to what ability have the highest DPS (damage per second) and how powerful the user is. So in short, it's pretty boring.

This is what I suggest: Let's have some abilites that doesn't deal direct damage. They might not be the best abilites in the game, but they might serve as ""tech"" to counter new metas or at least shake things up. Here is a few ideas:

* **Bulk Up (Fighting)**: The user tenses its muscles to bulk up its body, boosting its Attack Damage by 100% for the next 10 hits.

* **Agility (Psychic)**: The user relaxes and lightens its body to move faster, boosting its Attack and Dodge Speed (or is it recovery?) by 50% for 10 seconds.

* **Barrier(Psychic)**: The user throws up a sturdy wall that reduces incoming damage by 20%. Lasts until the user fails to dodge an ultimate ability.

* **Soft-Boiled(Normal)**: The user restores 30% of its Health over 3 seconds. During this time, the user can't attack.


Bulk Up, Barrier and Soft-Boiled might only be found with a handful of Pokemons, but Agility could be quite common, even to those that aren't Psychic-Types.

They will also have to create a reward card after beating this boss. It's also recommended that you describe your boss fight, but we don't want an essay. Keep it simple! 
For those that don't know what kind of bosses Karazhan has, I recommend this [website](http://www.wowhead.com/zone=3457/karazhan). Feel free to ask if you need further guidance!**

**So here is the shopping list: (Not more OR less)**

* 1 **Karazhan Boss** ([Example: Like this](http://i.imgur.com/n7waRes.png))

* 1 **Hero Power** (If your boss uses multiple Hero Powers that's fine. Party hard with this one!)

* 4 **Boss cards** (Cards that the boss will use during the encounter)

* 1 **Reward card** (For beating the boss)

* 1 Boss description (Only recommended)

The rules are still the same, but there is a few changes this time around. First, you will have to send your submission as an [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) album this time. (Since there is so many images.)

The time is up for our designers and we now move on to voting. Our contestants were tasked with creating a single card that was 
either a Dragon or had synergy with Dragons in some way. As it turns out, Dragons offered little to no challange for our designers 
and they have sent in some of the best Dragon-themed designs I have ever seen!

[**Here are the polls!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XhhnzhCWrWaqPeTwvC67VHpRCBbFhFpaGC0BzrJEkfM/viewform) We wish you all good luck!
Just as the first round, the polls will be open for two days and **close on the 7th of July (Thursday).**

**[EDIT]: Some designers didn't submit a card in time. It's for this reason some brackets only have a single card.**

[**You can see the bracket here!**](http://challonge.com/CustomHS)

Also, to help you prepare for the next round, we’re going to give you the next theme in advance:


#**[Unique to Hearthstone]**

*The Innkeeper greets you as you enter the Tavern. It's been a long day, and you can finally pull out your Paladin deck and play a game of Heartstone. Nothing feels better than to play Hearthstone with real cards. It doesn't take long until a fellow walks up to you and asks for a game. You agree, but quickly regret your decision as you learn that your opponent plays a Priest deck. Mindgames, Thoughtsteal, Resurrect and Mind Vision. You pass out from having to manually reshuffle your deck every turn and lose horribly.*

**For the third round we will revisit the ""[Unique to Hearthstone](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/2t0fo7/weekly_design_competition_33_unique_to_hearthstone/)"" theme. As Hearthstone is a digital card game, it can have mechanics that wouldn't normaly work in a physical TCG. Cards like [Thoughtsteal](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/c/c0/Thoughtsteal%2862%29.png) and [Shifter Zerus](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/b/b9/Shifter_Zerus%2835190%29.png) that would be to troublesome to keep track of or execute without the help of a computer. Your challlange is to create such a card that would only work in the digital Hearthstone game.**


That's it. Feel free to discuss what you think of the submissions or eleberate further on your own design.

A heads up that **we're implementing a new rule** for the competitions regarding submitting pre-existing cards.

Do let me know your thoughts about this rule though by [messaging the mods.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcustomhearthstone&amp;subject=&amp;message=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fcustomhearthstone)

Anyways, a congratulations to /u/Phyley for winning last week's competition with their card, [Bloodthirsty Watcher!](http://imgur.com/F7LWJow) You'll be getting the new, winner's flair as well as be deciding the theme of the compettion for next week. All the other enraging cards can be found here.

This week, the theme is **New Class Tribe Synergies** and has multiple parts to it. What you need to do is create a class card that focuses around tribal synergy. The catch is though, that it must be a *new* tribe synergy, so no beast druid/hunter, dragon priest, murloc paladin, pirate rogue/warrior, or demon warlock cards. You don't necessarily have to create a new tribe for the card but can use existing ones instead just within a class that doesnt currently support that minion type.
I look forward to all the entries as well as seeing who comes out on top! Now for some rules:

Rules:

* **You may not submit cards that you have posted to this subreddit from over a week ago.**

* This post will be open for submissions and voting around noon EST on Monday.

* You may submit up to two entries, with a separate comment containing a single card for each entry.

* All submissions must be posted in an image format.

* You have until Saturday to post your entries and vote on the ones you like.

So like many of you, I like to make Heartstone card and one of my favorite mechanics is ""At the start/end of your turn"". Sadly, it's very limited because it takes up so much text space. In general you don't want your card to have more than 15-ish words, and this ability already takes away 6.

The fix to this is simple, make a new Keyword. Two of them infact. The idea was to keep them short while at the same time make them memorable.

The new Keywords are: 

* **Sunrise**: At the start of your turn, do something.

* **Nightfall**: At the end of your turn, do something.

Here are some examples of the original and with the new keywords. (Sorry for the small originals!)

* Original [Lightwell](http://i.imgur.com/lcMJMnb.png) 
* New [Lightwell](http://i.imgur.com/1CuTiGH.png)

* Original [Master Sworsmith](http://i.imgur.com/VDUZt82.png)
* New [Master Sworsmith](http://i.imgur.com/hBilen9.png)

* Original [Alarm-o-Bot](http://i.imgur.com/v2hG89y.png)
* New [Alarm-o-Bot](http://i.imgur.com/vvjpnoi.png)

* Original [Emperor Thaurissan](http://i.imgur.com/hcwUvvm.png)
* New [Emperor Thaurissan](http://i.imgur.com/90kQd5Q.png)

I understand that many of these cards don't see much play, but I also think that becuase this ability takes up so much text space, it's difficult to make new cards.

Hey there fellow designers!

I don't know if I will be alone in this, but here we go! There is something wrong with the Weekly Design Competition lately. Once upon a time it was a place 
for the greatest minds of this community to see who could make the best card. Now, it feels completly diffrent. Just like Heartstone, playing it slow and 
methodical is no longer how you win. Instead, the winning play is to rush out submissions the first day and then shower in upvotes. What happend?

I see genius submissions that Blizzard should take notice of that just gain 2 upvotes (Not talking about me here.), while submissions with spelling errors and other 
simple mistakes often get a lot more.

I hate to say it,  but I'm getting the feeling that there is some foul play going on behind the scene. Friends that upvote each other or people with multible account. Don't get me wrong, 
I DON'T MIND LOSING. Losing is fun when you feel that you can do better next time. I remember a time when I saw designers win with brilliant cards like [this](http://i.imgur.com/MieIX41.png)  and [this](http://i.imgur.com/CoINfO4.png) 
Now it feels like some winners just copied something that was posted last week.

While I have noticed that I often stand alone when I criticize Genji, I still think it's important (and healthy) that we try to look at things from a different 
perspective. I will also say this now, I do not have beta access to Overwatch nor have I ever plyed it. But after seeing countless videos and streams, I think everyone
got a rough idea on how it's being played. This will most likely be my last attempt to share this opinion.



**What is my problem with Genji?**

For almost as long as we have known about Overwatch one question has been on everyones mind - Who is the ""Green Ninja""? Not much was known about him and many speculated that he 
was Hanzo or Hanzo's brother. No matter what we thought one thing was certain. This ninja is bringing the melee action to Overwatch. Sometime later at Blizcon, he was 
finally revealed. 

A gamplay trailer showed the green ninja, now called Genji, deflecting arrows and throwing shurikens. I thought to myself: ""A swordsman that throws 
shurikens and deflects attacks? I'm not worthy!"" In fact, it was to good to be true. It turned out that Genji wasn't the melee hero of my dream, his sword was just his ultimate
and his normal attack was a bunch of shurikens.

Safe to say, I was furious. After venting my anger on this reddit I learned that the developers actually tried to make him a melee hero, but gave up when they couldn't make it work. Instead, 
Instead of living up to the hype, they went the short road and put his melee animations on his ultimate (save time and money.) and gave him a simple range attack.

I could go on all day on how stupid all of this sounds, but I don't want to waste your time. Instead, I want to go through Genji's skills and try to explain why his kit feels so broken.


**SHURIKEN (Main attack)**

&gt; Genji looses three deadly throwing stars in quick succession. Alternatively, he can throw three shuriken in a wider spread.

I will say this, I like shurikens. Everyone likes them! So why do I dislike it here? It's simple, they treat it like a gun. Genji will keep throwing like a machine gun 
while jumping around. Even worse, he will keep throwing shurikens even when in melee. Why does everyone think this is cool? For an elite ninja it looks really silly.
My second problem with this is the lack of synergy it has with his other skills, so onward to those.



**DEFLECT (E)**


&gt; With lightning-quick swipes of his sword, Genji reflects an oncoming projectile and sends it rebounding towards his opponent.

He reflects attacks with his sword? Okey, that is pretty awesome! But how does Genji benifit from this skill? He doesn't, 
or at least very little. As a ranged hero his primary way of defense against enemy attacks is with LOS (Line of Sight). This means that he can hide 
behind cover to avoid enemy attacks. In a sense, Deflect can be used to remove that need and just take the attacks in the open. But by doing so he is 
just using 50% of the potential of this ability. The other important part is that his movement when using this ability isn't impared. This means he can use this skill to move in or retreat 
without the risk of being gunned down. This is an ability that is more useful for melee.


**SWIFT STRIKE (Shift)**

&gt; Genji darts forward, slicing the air with his katana and passing through foes in his path. After the initial strike, his targets begin to bleed and take 
additional damage over time. If Genji eliminates a target with this ability, he can instantly use it again.


An intresting abiliy for a ranged damage dealer. In theory, Genji can use this skill to quickly burst down an enemy while unloading shurikens in the 
enemies face. It can also be used to climb and traverse the map. Yet again, I'm geting the feeling that Geji is only using 50% of the potential here. 
This skill is in most sense a gap closer. While it can be used to climp things, it's a powerful tool to come in close and personal. This is something 
that most ranged heroes want to avoid.


**DRAGONBLADE (Ultimate)**

&gt; Genji brandishes his katana for a brief period of time. Until he sheathes his sword, Genji can deliver killing strikes to any targets within his reach.

The people at Blizzard are smart, I know that. But this is so underwhelming. They litraly just took his melee animations, added some flashy animations to it, 
and then called it his ultimate. For 10 seconds his kit will finally make sense and everything will be great. But once those 10 seconds are over, you are 
back to throwing shurikens.


So all in all, I think Genji was rushed for Blizcon. Maybe they wanted to work on other things, maybe they thought it would sell more pre orders. I will not pretend 
that I have all the anwsers, I'm just a guy that wanted to play a Swordsman in Overwatch.",Overwatch,"Genji, and why I think he is overhyped.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/3s69id/genji_and_why_i_think_he_is_overhyped/

So, Genji, the Cyborg Ninja, was announced and everyone seems very excited about him. He dashes around and deflect incoming attacks with ninja reflexes, it's really cool. But that's just it, *I dislike everything else about his kit.*

Why is his normal attack just throwing shurikens? Why is his second attack just throwing shurikens in another pattern? Why was he advertised as a [Swordsman](http://i.imgur.com/BglTxz4.jpg) and then changed to a [ranged Assassin?](http://imgur.com/Ah8IIPY).

Was it to hard to implement melee into this game? Hell no! Reinhardt is a melee only hero, and every other hero has some sort of basic melee attack. It doesn't break the game.

So maybe it wasn't unique enough? Then why make his main attack a complete rip-off from Lucios main attack? The only difference is that Lucio shoots 1 more shot during his burst, that's it. I don't have a problem with shurikens, shurikens is awesome! And I also get that Ninjas use Shuirikens, sure. But this is not what anyone wanted.



When you look back at his kit you can see that they made him with melee in mind. His deflect attack is to protect him from ranged attacks (More useful for a melee) and his dash attack is a gap-closer (More useful for a melee). Even the animations of these abilites suggest that he was using a sword.

Now he's kit just feels lazy. It's like they didn't bother reworking his kit and instead just put his melee animations on his ulimate and gave him a simple shuriken attack. Good job.

I know I am a little late to all of this, but am I alone in this? *Do people like that the Cyborg Ninja isn't a malee Hero?*
