1,"No, your partner no longer greets you every morning, and he no longer follows you around after you beat the main story, unfortunately. He gets reduced to an ordinary recruit and acts like any other Pokemon in any Friend Area (for the most part), and only shows up for certain story cutscenes. That was one of the lamest things out of Rescue Team's post-game, but I can see why they did it:

Since they give you the option to make different Pokemon (other than the main character) the leader in a rescue mission now, they also give you the option to play as said leader in the overworld. So if you recruit Pokemon like Rayquaza or Kyogre and select Make Leader, you can literally sleep in your house as them and wander around Pokemon Square as these giant ass legendaries. It was pretty cool.

It was a feature they removed in the later games, in favor of letting your partner follow you around forever rather than get reduced to an ordinary recruit like in Rescue Team.",2016-11-21 05:36:51+00:00,da96zzx,1.0,t3_5e2eg1,1161.0,MysteryDungeon
2,"I always figured they were just added for comedic purposes.

3,"That's actually an interesting concept. I always wondered how the game would exaggerate how long the characters would take to get to certain dungeons, only to make them all a breeze to get to later on.

Like in Rescue Team. Running from Pokemon Square to Lapis Cave and Mt. Blaze took an unprecedented amount of time given how the game described what the player and partner had to go through on the way there.

And in Explorers with how long it took to get to base camp at Foggy Forest, taking several days as well as a few extra going through a few dungeons along the way.

Then in Super, the getting to Lively Town from Serene Village for the first time took a couple in-game days the first time because of the Sheer Mountain Range and Gentle Slope Cave, yet the game just completely skips those two days later on when you [spoilers](#s ""return from the Voidlands"")

The other games also show you *instantly* getting to all those dungeons that initially took forever to get to once they're not relevant to the plot anymore. Always found that weird, but I figure it was just done for the sake of gameplay convenience.

The idea of showing us travel to the dungeon of our choice is nice, and I feel it would well--Gates to Infinity tried doing something along those lines every time we had to use a Magnagate, but all that did was give us one or two more dungeons to go through before getting to the dungeon we wanted.",2016-11-20 19:24:22+00:00,da8ha0q,1.0,t3_5dzd81,3041.0,MysteryDungeon

This is amazing! I made my account here specifically for this sub about 10 months ago, all because I was really into Super when I bought it on release exactly one year ago. How time flies. I was just a fresh college freshie then.

15,"**Team Razor Wind:** Zangoose. He's almost always shown to be in the middle whenever they're in a formation, and he also looks the edgiest. Not the deepest reason, but it's there.

**Team Glee:** Togepi. Ledyba and Politoed look so much bigger than him in comparison, and the idea of such a tiny Pokemon leading those two is funny to me. Also, the Togepi line's PokeDex entries all have to do with joy and happiness, which is what Team Glee is all about. So I feel he would be the one to start the team in the first place.

**Team Seedgey:** Their names are a combination of both their names, and since there are only two members, I can't exactly say one should lead the other. We don't really get to know Seedot and Pidgey very well, either--sure, some birds eat acorns, and Flying is super-effective against Grass, but these two's team dynamic seems to be on a higher level of understanding than Team Tasty's from the get-go, so I feel Seedot and Pidgey have enough of a mutual respect for each other to run their team with an equal amount of power on both ends.

**Team Ebony:** Shuppet. Murkrow's always so headstrong and compulsive when it comes to obtaining shiny objects, while Shuppet is always there to keep her in check. Even though Shuppet has her own taste in treasure as well, she just seems to be calmer and more collected than her, and to me, seems she can lead an exploration properly without potentially throwing away everything just for a rare item.

**Team Slacker:** Neither. They'd both be too lazy to lead, and would both be too lazy to even bother picking a leader. 

**Team Raider:** Gallade. Being a Psychic/Fighting-type, I feel he has both the brains and the brawns to work as the leader of the team, balancing Rhyperior's pure strength and Roserade's clever wits in battle. The PokeDex, which PMD bases a lot of its Pokemon's personalities and attributes around, also mentions Gallade's gentlemanly and chivalrous nature, which is a perfect attitude to have when it comes to rescuing Pokemon in need and being a role model toward others.

**Team Poochy:** The Poochyena that's always on the left, duh. Clearly he's the alpha of the pack.

26,"I dunno, I can see why people would get annoyed that the game treats the hero and partner as children, but I personally didn't mind it. The PMD games have always been children's games anyway, and the hero and partner in each installment have always been considered by everyone in-universe to be very young, even if the writing doesn't explicitly say they're kids.

I respected that Super was trying something different with the roles of the main characters, and how they treated the relationships between everyone in the first half of the game. The school sections, the chemistry with the school kids, the build-up to the official friendship with the partner, and the slice-of-life feel were nice (and would've been nicer if actual plot happened more often to balance it out).

The coddling from the adults was a little grating, sure, but they're all kids (except the hero, who's just in a kid's body), and they all learned to stop coddling relatively quickly. And the writing overall was pretty standard for PMD. And to add onto that, Super was the only PMD game to ever explicitly use the word ""die"" without sugarcoating it. All the other games, including Rescue Team and Explorers, used alternatives, like ""get rid of"", or ""make disappear"".

Don't get me wrong, I like a solid, deep, dark story. But any story can reach that level whether they're an elementary school student or the owner of acres and acres of land. I usually think it's jarring and a little unrealistic to me when games do the latter--giving you tons of power with little rhyme, reason, or build-up as to why (like when you're suddenly appointed Owner of Join Avenue in B2/W2 or the Owner of the Safari Zone in HG/SS within seconds of you entering it).

28,"Ahhh, I've been looking forward to this arrangement! I found this track absolutely adorable when I first heard it in-game, and it really helped immerse me into story! Contrary to popular opinion, I enjoyed a lot of the school sections and honestly preferred how the first half of Super's plot was paced compared to the second half. 

I did like the second half a lot, but something about the first half's setting, characters, and set-up really made me feel that the rest of the game was going to slowly but surely build up to something bigger with the Pokemon we were introduced to rather than transition into a completely different arc with a whole new set of characters to focus on. Not that it wasn't a bad move, but we got to know the school kids and teachers and parents so well! And with how the classmates were developed and how much closer they had gotten with the hero and partner, I always figured they'd all become more relevant from here on out. 

Anyway! Back to the actual music. I'm glad this project is still up and running, and I'm really grateful for all the fun, playable sheets you've made for the community!

31,"Of course it's a given that the PMD writers wouldn't know about Ultra Beasts until after Sun and Moon was announced like the rest of us; consider all this talk about UBs in PMD as headcanons more than anything.

Besides, PMD *has* shown ties to the main series in the past--Chunsoft made the Coronet Rock for Nosepass back when Mt. Coronet was the only known way to evolve it into Probopass back in Gen 4, and along with Rescue Team's references to the human world in both Friend Areas and in the main story, there's a reason all these theories with PMD tying into the main series exist, as ridiculous as some of them might be.

I don't believe very many of the theories that tie the main series and PMD world together (like on that implies the PMD world takes place in the PC, or the one that the PMD world is the main series world centuries after Team Plasma and N succeeded in liberating people from Pokemon, etc.), but the UBs are most likely going to be treated like any other Pokemon at the end of the day in S/M, and might just be added into the next PMD because of that, if there is one.

So it's interesting for me to wonder and speculate how they'll be implemented. Mewtwo vaguely references his past (created by humans to fight) in Rescue Team and has his own mini-story arc in the post-game. And Genesect...as well as other human-made Pokemon...are just sort of thrown in there with no explanation given at all.

The most realistic possibility for whether UBs will be implemented into PMD or not is either not at all, or they'll just be added with no rhyme or reason as to why they're there.

But who knows, Spike Chunsoft might surprise us and make them a part of the plot as well. It's why I think an awkward retcon wouldn't completely be out of the question. Just look at what Super did to make all the past PMD games canon, including the WiiWare games.

And to add onto your theory, the [spoilers](#s ""Void Shadows from the Voidlands"") may also be considered UBs if your theory is correct. Since [spoilers](#s ""UBs seem to impersonate or don the appearance of other people, Void Shadows in Super have been shown to impersonate or don the appearance of other Pokemon like Bunnelby, Mega Gengar, Mega Tyranitar, and all the Pokemon you fight in dungeons in the Voidlands and the Tree of Life."")",2016-11-05 20:42:41+00:00,d9na8xa,2.0,t1_d9na166,317.0,MysteryDungeon

They manage to fit all the important exposition (and some wisecracks) during the timed, controlled flight sections. And when you're fighting on land, unless you're an expert speedrunner, it's doubtful you'll be missing very many of the conversations that go on as you're completing most of the chapters (except maybe 18).

It's mainly the bosses that have this issue, especially when you're facing off against Dark Lord Gaol in Chapter 2 and the Chariot Master in Chapter 19. *So* much insightful dialogue is given toward both of those characters and their stories, but their fights are usually so short or quick that you totally miss them. Almost all the other bosses don't have this problem to the same extent as those two, though.

And if this were applied to PMD, none of it would be voice acted, and the way the gameplay works so you sort of have to stop and plan every movement you make through. So I think it could work.",2016-11-05 05:01:12+00:00,d9mjzlu,4.0,t1_d9mh3k3,5593.0,MysteryDungeon
36,"Explorers of Sky did something vaguely similar to that--they weren't full-blown conversations between characters, of course, but it did give some occasionally insightful dialogue when talking to any of your teammates in a dungeon--especially story characters. Rescue Team and Super do this, too, but nowhere to the level that Sky took it.

In Special Episode 5, for example, [spoilers](#s ""Dusknoir"") has several possible different quotes he can say that change with each and every dungeon you go to with him. His dialogue starts out [spoilers](#s ""cold, usually wondering why the Sableye would attack him or why Primal Dialga would betray or replace him; then it would progress to him teasing Grovyle about how worried he is that he'll attack him while his back his turned; eventually, he calms down and acts as the voice of reason toward Grovyle's constant impatience and rush to get things done, giving him advice and commenting on whatever situation they're in."") This happens other times throughout the story and episodes as well--Snover's dungeon dialogue in Star Cave doesn't really spoil anything, but the interactions are there. I think it's a really nice feature they added and helps showcase how some characters progress and develop overtime outside of required cutscenes.

In Gates, small talk between characters only happens during cutscenes (like when we see Emolga and Virizion chatting while they're going through their portion of the Glacier Palace), but it does interrupt the gameplay to show that interaction happening.

If you're wanting something like PMD taking the Kid Icarus: Uprising route and having character conversations take place as you're progressing through a dungeon (most likely without voice acting), then I can see it working.

Not all remixes have to reflect the original tone of the song or try to replicate it.

47,"Well, I mean, in their defense, it's pretty difficult to write in a silent protagonist in an anime special that requires dialogue, voices, character interactions, and exposition.

Video games can get away with this because they're *meant* to be immersive, and games like PMD, main series Pokémon, and Zelda have mute protagonists for the sake of inserting yourself in the game and using your imagination to picture how *you* would live in the world you're playing in.

Just look at how they handled Red in Pokémon Origins. They can't have him be completely silent or have him only say ""Yes"" or ""No"" like in the games because the story *entirely* revolves around him and how he interacts with the world around him. So to compensate, they gave him the persona of the average newbie Pokémon player, to help some people visualize the time they too were just like him picking up the series for the first time as a kid. That was Origins's intended audience, after all--people who played through Gen 1 (or their remakes) as when they were younger.

Pokémon Generations gets away with keeping the protagonists completely silent because the series doesn't revolve around them. They only get a few seconds of screen time because the series has other characters take the spotlight to drive the story along, which allows the writers to more accurately portray everyone closer to how they are in the games.

Even the various Pokémon manga out there make *every* protagonist speak and have their own personality rather than leave them a blank slate, because they're required to bring life to the story on their own. Everyone from Red to Yvonne (Y) has their own personality and character arc and aren't totally mute.

In PMD, having a completely silent protagonist in a form of medium where the bonding between the player, partner, and side characters is the driving focus of the story (alongside the mysteries of the plot, of course) the protagonist pretty much *has* to be able to speak and act on their own, so we could see *why* the partner likes him so much, why the guild and towns-Pokemon trust him, why he seems to be an overall good guy--and so we could see the things *he's* thinking while he wraps his mind about this whole ""turning-into-a-Pokemon"" thing. Having them be silent or having the partner interpret their pantomimes like in the games would just be awkward. 

That's what makes video games as an art form unique. They make silent protagonists work more often, and often do a good job at immersing players to really *be* their avatar and interpret everything in the game at their own leisure.

Besides, a lot of what the protagonist in the Explorers games says in his head can pretty much interpreted to be exactly what he says out loud to the partner and other Pokemon. And that's what the anime went for (for the most part). Not to mention that the protagonist *does* have some lines he says out loud, so he's not even completely mute, even in the games. He has lines in the very beginning of the game when he and Grovyle get attacked and separated, and near the end of the game.
 
I agree that the PMD anime specials didn't do the games justice as much as it could have, but for different reasons.",2016-10-26 01:39:12+00:00,d97wrgv,2.0,t1_d973yw2,37056.0,MysteryDungeon

54,"In Rescue Team, the explanation was that many Pokemon had been driven man from the constant natural disasters to the point they have begun attacking others irrationally in an attempt to desperately protect their territory (like Skarmory on Mt. Steel).

In Explorers, the explanation was that many Pokemon have become to go mad and restless over time stopping in certain areas of the world, with more and more Pokemon like those cropping up the more areas these temporal anomalies appear (like the Snorunt from Special Episode 5 who had a fragile mental state but could at least be reasoned with to an extent, and Primal Dialga, who had completely lost it). 

The natural disasters in Rescue Team and time stopping/space distorting/nightmares spreading in Explorers are also stated to be the reason why an increase in Mystery Dungeons have begun to appear.

Gates and Super don't really give an explanation for why Mystery Dungeons exist or why you fight other Pokemon in them other than ""they're mysterious, I guess"".

Pokemon that live in Mystery Dungeons in all the games, though, officially live there and are always incredibly defensive and territorial (like the three legendary birds in Rescue Team, Luxray/Manectric and their tribe in Explorers, Poliwrath in Super, etc., as well as all the generic enemy Pokemon you fight in every installment on each floor).",2016-10-17 20:12:45+00:00,d8w7bjs,4.0,t1_d8w593o,2424.0,MysteryDungeon

57,"A lot of Pokemon's verbal tics have changed in Super. A majority of the time, it's because of a translation error.

For example, Gengar, who returns in Super from Rescue Team, now has ""Hee-hee!"" as his signature laugh rather than ""Kekekeh!"", making him indistinguishable from any other Gengar and making it difficult for veteran PMD players to know if this is the same Gengar from Rescue Team. It doesn't help that Gengar never references anything he did in the previous games, either. This poster makes it more clear, though, since he's in it along with the other cameos drawn in: http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/cho_dungeon/game/pokemon/images/150925_01/img_01.jpg

Loudred also no longer EMPHASIZES certain WORDS through CAPS, as well, but unlike Gengar, Super makes it much more obvious that he's the same one from the Explorers games. (Yet Exploud speaks in all caps...)

And Magnemite, Magneton, and Magnezone say ""Pi-pi-pi!"" instead of ""Bzzzzt!"" like in past games. This is most likely done to further distinguish them from Beedrill and Combee, who speak using similar onomatopoeia. 

Dialga and Palkia (as well as other legendaries that used to speak in all caps in Explorers) no longer speak in all caps in Super as well.

60,"I respect your opinion, but I do have a few disagreements with it:

Rescue Team had a *ton* of post-game content, though. It just didn't hold your hand as much and didn't give you as many cutscene-driven clues to tell you what to do like Explorers' and the later games' post-games did. After Buried Relic is revealed, you're sort of just left to your own devices to figure out how to progress by yourself by talking to NPCs and doing missions on your own prerogative without the game doing some of that for you, and back when I was a kid playing through the game for the first time, I didn't mind that at all. While I did miss my partner being an actual character again and cutscene-style interactions between the other Pokemon I've come to know and love, I liked being independent and being left to adjust to the game's difficulty and solving its mysteries on my own. Added an extra couple hundred hours to my playtime and it was really fun. Even coming back to it now that I'm older, Rescue Team's post-game was pretty expansive for what it was.

Gates was the one with the short post-game. And expanding Paradise and battling legendaries just for the sake of battling legendaries were the only new things available in the game as ""extra content"", and with the limitation of doing only one mission per day in that game, it felt more like a chore to me than anything. And this is coming from someone who spent several months trying to reach the final rank in Gates, trying to unlock everything it had to offer, only to stop and lose interest once I reached the penultimate rank and did several missions after.

And I'm not sure what you mean by Super not having a complex storyline... It started out simple, yeah, but as it went on it threw a ton of things at you at once and all of this lore exposition added onto the plot all throughout the second half. Even you yourself pointed out the most pivotal plot twist of the whole plot that made everything even *more* convoluted and confusing and still brushed it off as simple. 

I dunno, I'd say all the PMD games's stories are equally as deep as complex, honestly. None are really more simple than the other (except Rescue Team, but I cut it some slack because it was the first game in the series).

But if there's one thing Super did have, it was difficult dungeons and a post-game that was a combination of both what Rescue Team and Gates did with their post-games--having a short epilogue story (Gates) tacked onto at the end and leaving you alone to gather the rest of the legendaries and explore the rest of the world without any push from the game for you to do so (Rescue Team).

Anyway. It's hard for me to pick a favorite PMD game per say, since I like them all for different reasons...

* Rescue Team had my favorite antagonist and gives me a bit of nostalgia bias because it was the first PMD game I played.

* Explorers of Sky has the most content and has special treatment over the other PMD games because it's a director's cut of two other PMD games that allowed the developers to expand on otherwise flat and unexplored characters and made them more likable. (Seriously, if any of the other PMD games got the Sky treatment, they'd definitely make picking the best PMD game harder for more people.)

* Gates has the most consistent and tightly-written story. Its cast of characters is more centralized and having less Pokemon in the game overall gives us more time to get to know and love each and every one of them; I liked that, for once, the main cast is actually *relevant* and *useful* and *equally as helpful* as you and your partner are. In every other PMD game, it's always you and your partner doing 95% of the work to progress the story and save the world--in this game, it felt like I was in an actual, close-knit team.

* And Super has the best gameplay features to me (for the most part). It's like it took all the best gameplay elements of every PMD game prior and improved upon it and made certain elements its own. As much as I miss Gummis, I don't mind more advanced partner AI and looplets and emeras to help compensate. And having shared EXP throughout my entire recruited team helps cut time on grinding if I want to use different Pokemon (something Gates implemented first but vastly improved upon by Super).",2016-10-13 06:40:33+00:00,d8pyff1,1.0,t3_5783jo,14247.0,MysteryDungeon

77,"S-Sorry [](#riolu2)

Everyone does only give 1-2 lines of dialogue, but doing the missions of each character usually gets you a little more insight into what they've been doing. That, and most of the Pokemon who had jobs in the past games are always quick to mention it in the overworld (i.e. Timburr, Swanna, Makuhita, etc.).

Seeing the Pokemon each Pokemon is connected to, and what other Pokemon show up in each cameo's mission helps see who they've been hanging out with nowadays (Umbreon and Espeon with Flareon and some other Eeveelutions in their mission; Gengar with Banette in his mission, etc.). 

Though that much still isn't very much to go on, the fact that a lot of characters that used to be together aren't anymore just implies (to me, at least) that they've gone their separate ways (or at least don't see each other as often anymore). 

Gengar is connected to Gardevoir, and Medicham, yet said Gardevoir and Medicham are part of Team Charm. That fact alone allows us to fill the blanks with headcanons on why that is. Ninetails and Absol also hang out together now, as shown in their Connection Orb placement and the mission you have with them, apparently looking out for other humans who have been turned into Pokemon.

Of course, there have been arguments that the cameos in Super *are* in fact written arbitrarily with little thought given to them, and that the Connection Orb is just a tool to provide fanservice with little rhyme or reason as to who is connected who, but I personally disagree with that to some extent.

79,"Super confirms that Wigglytuff's Guild is still running strong. Some of the Pokemon we came to know and love in Explorers graduated or moved on to do different jobs (like Chimecho and Croagunk) while some still continue to train for the guild to this day (like Corphish, Loudred and Bidoof). Chatot and Wigglytuff still run the place with their same ranks, of course.

But the reason why everyone is so panicked and scrambled across the overworld is because Wigglytuff has gone missing from the guild (for some unspecified amount of time), and everyone, graduates and trainees alike, are searching all over the world to find him. Every mission you do with Wigglytuff's Guild serves as a little arc that eventually explains this. 

So you go on several different missions with the lower members of the guild, who have also ended up with their own problems while searching for their Guildmaster, until you unlock Chatot's mission that *does* succeed in finding him, only to find out Wigglytuff just wanted some space for Chatot for a little while because of how overbearing he can be sometimes.

As for the Gates characters, Super doesn't explain what happened to Paradise. Post Town is still stated to exist, and Gurdurr and the Timburr still have their jobs as carpenters and continue to build houses for Pokemon, but other Pokemon like Swanna, Rampardos, and Cinccino no longer run their facilities in Post Town, and all the Paradise members have gone their separate ways. Umbreon and Espeon seem to hang out with the other Eeveelutions nowadays (most likely their other relatives), Dunsparce and Emolga are a sole duo, Virizion and Keldeo are a sole duo that keep closer tabs on the other Swords of Justice now, etc. etc. Munna and her group have all split apart, but you get to see her and Gigalith exchange letters for what's stated to be the first time in a very long time, asking to see how they've been doing since the end of Gates, which is really sweet.

But yeah. My point is, Super did a decent job explaining what a lot of the cameos were doing in-game and why (sometimes they even did so subtly like with Gengar, which I liked), but for some reason, they just chose not to elaborate on the stories of some of the other cameos.

Coronet in or constantly reference it in every game without inhibiting any new ideas and locations they might have for later games).

The people at Chunsoft probably weren't sure how handle Magneton's and Nosepass's evolutions, since the Explorers games came out well before Gen 5, and Mt. Coronet was the only known way of evolving them back then. So, not wanting to stray too far from the main series games' canon, the Coronet Rock was made, and was given a vague description to avoid messing with different continuities.

The only other major NPC/plot discrepancy I can think of is in Explorers, where through the entire beginning and middle portions of the main story, literally everyone mentions that the five Time Gears help keep time stable throughout each area they were placed in and make sure the world stays in balance. Even the Lake Guardians themselves.

But come the latter half/near the end of the game, and apparently that it's completely okay for the Time Gears to be removed from their area and that only by returning them to their rightful place on Temporal Tower would time be restored throughout the world properly.

I know there was a really well-written headcanon/theory post with a ton of elaborate evidence justifying this sudden shift in logic with the Gears on this sub sometime back (I'll link it if I can find it), but before that, I was a bit confused on how the Gears worked and what their true purpose was then. It could just be a product of the game's writing not elaborating enough rather than an actual contradiction.

And, small thing, there's also the very minor discrepancies in certain Pokémon's speech patterns between the older games and Super. For example, Gengar says ""Hee-hee!"" in Super rather than his standard ""Kekekeh!"" from Rescue Team. He and other Pokémon's text changes are most likely a translation error/a result of a localizer not knowing the context of the older games. Other older characters like Munna and Team AWD were translated seamlessly, while other cameos just felt awkwardly written, as if a different translator wrote their text without having looked up their role from the past games. As another example to prove this, Loudred doesn't capitalizes certain words for emphasis anymore, and speaks in proper grammar with lowercase words the entire time, yet Exploud, a completely irrelevant non-story non-cameo NPC, speaks in all caps.

The Magnet Police force also now uses ""Pi-pi-pi!"" as onamatopeia in Super rather than ""BZZ-BZZ-BZZ"" in Rescue Team and Explorers, which, unlike the above paragraph with Gengar, was most likely an *intentional* change to differentiate them from Super's Bee Squad and their verbal tic (""Busy-buzzy-bee-bee!"").

And then there's Bunnelby randomly speaking about himself in the third person when you first meet him and him never doing that again afterwards, ever. And then him suddenly having this ""obvious"" verbal cue that Mawile was able to pick up on when he was blobbed up (in the Japanese version, the justification for Mawile attacking Bunnelby made a tiny bit more sense, but still).",2016-09-25 04:26:54+00:00,d80z5sz,1.0,t3_54ajpr,47053.0,MysteryDungeon

I'm down for this! Anything to help the cause! I loved the first two shorts and have watched your whole series so far! I'll e-mail you ASAP!

But classes and such have eat up a lot of my free time, so it'll take me a little while to brainstorm and type up an official draft! I don't have any examples of any previous writings I have, but I'll be sure to make my possible shorts as competently-written as possible!

The shorts you have so far have only been a few minutes long at most. Should we stick to that timeframe? And should we also stick to only using Charmander and Chikorita, or do we have freedom to potentially add other characters if we do a good-enough job of fitting them in? Also, since your parts come on weekly, and you're already over 5/8 of the way through the game, how long do we have?",2016-09-20 23:41:55+00:00,d7vbm36,1.0,t3_53ppsc,8381.0,MysteryDungeon
86,"1. Explorers of Sky. It took everything the Rescue Team games and Time/Darkness had and made a much better game out of it, both mechanics-wise and story-wise. It obviously still has its faults, but if the other games (i.e. Gates and Super) were given ""Sky""-esque upgrades to them, then I'm sure they would definitely give Sky a run for its money. Super already seems to do that on its own.

2. Carracosta. I have a soft spot for strict, apprehensive parents that eventually soften up and reach proper understandings with their children. He was a nice antithesis to Nuzleaf, and I wish we got to see a bit more of him in Super. [PSMD spoilers](#s ""His letter out of all the others was what made me tear up when we had to leave Serene Village, and seeing that optional dialogue you could have with him in the post-game where he confuses Mew for your partner was pretty sad for me."")

3. Team Meanies. It was the first boss I died against in Rescue Team (multiple times, in fact). If you return to Sinister Woods to rematch them after losing, you actually get a bit of humorous dialogue with Gengar before your second fight against him--something the other bosses didn't really emulate as well. And the fact that this battle was the only one in the entire game to have a unique theme, and was the only boss that involved battling more than one Pokemon at once stood out to me. Sure, Explorers and the later games did that a ton, but at the time, I was really into wanting to beat them down. Plus, this is the only time in the series where the game allows you to defeat your rivals/enemy teams in a battle, so it was extra satisfying to show them who's boss. 

4. ""Igglybuff the Prodigy"". ""In the Future of Darkness"" was nice, lengthy, and deep and all, but I just preferred Igglybuff's [Sky spoilers](#s ""and Armaldo's"") character development and interactions together, and the end of the episode was just slightly more heartwrenching to me than the end of SE5.

Also, I'm surprised you liked ""Today's Oh My Gosh!"" No one ever really talks about it. I thought it was cute.",2016-09-20 06:57:56+00:00,d7uavql,1.0,t3_53lwv0,5500.0,MysteryDungeon

All of these posts should provide some insight as to what other people thought about Super Mystery Dungeon. I personally thought it was a great game. I won't go into too much detail since the some of the positive comments on the posts I linked to do so already.

Also, please read the FAQ and use this subreddit's search bar before making a post to make sure no one else has asked it already! The first link I gave you sends you to a post literally added a couple days ago.

A lot of people here have been complaining about others posting the same topics over and over on this subreddit, so I'm here to save you some potential harsher backlash. 

It's only become a problem for some people here because out of all the links I sent you, there are still many, many more that ask if Super Mystery Dungeon is any good, from both a newcomers' perspectives and PMD veterans' persepctives alike.

Either way, if you're new to PMD, Super has a lot of cameos and references to the older PMD games. They're not relevant to the story and are just there for the sake of making fun little callbacks to the previous games, as Super's story holds up well enough on its own, regardless of whether you're new to PMD or not.

If you've played at least one of the other PMD games, then you'll catch at least a few of the references they make, and that makes the experience with Super a bit more wholesome.

I also suggest to play the PMD games in order if you're new, just to get the most out of them without feeling like playing the older games is a huge downgrade compared to Super (which they are, gameplay-wise, which makes the experience a lot more jarring, which is why playing them in order would be better).

If you're not or just want something to hold you over till S/M and you don't care about the other PMD games, then Super will work just fine.",2016-09-17 17:41:02+00:00,d7qr2h5,1.0,t3_538747,513.0,MysteryDungeon

92,"/uj This is actually a pretty well-written YTP. The sentence splicing and editing was decent enough, it had overarching jokes and a main focus, and the writing all revolved around one scene and what the uploader could do with it without putting too much random filler and throwaway nonsense jokes. If you wrote the entire script of this YTP down on paper, it would actually sound pretty coherent and would make for an actual comedy skit. I'm impressed.

And in Explorers-onward, Pikachu destroys entire rooms with Discharge, which is absolutely broken in every game.

97,"Same for Jirachi's role in Super. If his wish-granting abilities were real or super overpowered, he would've been able to prevent the whole turning-to-stone fiasco and everything else related to it from happening before it became a huge problem. That game also shows he isn't omniscient--if he didn't know how Pokemon were being turned to stone from the get-go, there's most likely no way he could've known that some Pokemon and his buddy were going through hell and back to travel to the past.

He even says that he 'maybe' grants wishes, and never addresses that possibility again. It's a little disappointing to admit, but the interpretation that Jirachi didn't actually do anything in Bidoof's Wish and just told Bidoof straight up what might happen in the future has a little more evidence backing it up than this theory does.

I still like the idea of Jirachi being the reason the protagonist in Sky was turned into a Pokemon, though. Would've been perfect imo.

I guess I'll have to stick with the whole ""humans existing in the PMD world cause massive, dangerous distortions in space unless the planet is either completely paralyzed or said human is turned into a Pokemon"" theory that Palkia, the voice at Luminous Spring, and Hydreigon mention.",2016-09-11 04:53:50+00:00,d7huwkg,2.0,t1_d7hprj8,8572.0,MysteryDungeon

99,"Maybe Dusknoir got overconfident and figured he wouldn't ever have to travel back to the past anymore now that he had Grovyle, the hero, and his other best friend in his possession? I like to think he spent some of his time in Treasure Town and the Guild getting to know each and every Pokemon there and gauging how much of a possible threat they could be to his plans if something came up. And none of them really clicked with him as ""problematic"".

And that's why he decided to kidnap the three of them in public. To confuse and bewilder everyone at the last second after a tearful good-bye.

And it apparently worked too, since everyone in town and the guild didn't really...DO anything to try to find the two of you after you left. And they were STILL all convinced Dusknoir was a good guy. Chatot and the others even think he ""pulled them in by mistake"", or you two ""slipped in by accident"", or that you two just ""had a bad dream""!

But Chatot gets weak in the knees whenever he's around a figure of authority, so he's just delusional...though the others have no excuse. Officer Magnezone and the Lake Trio didn't even do anything about it. Isn't it their job to investigate this kind of thing?

Dusknoir dragged them off so slowly, and even made a dramatic monolgoue about it in front of everyone.

""... Or is it? It's too soon for farewells! You two...are coming with me!"" *dragdragdrag*

101,"While the wait can be pretty unbearable sometimes, I think it's for the best that Spike Chunsoft releases every new PMD game at the end of every generation. Just like the main series, PMD tends to sell less and less copies with each new installment while still remaining fairly successful, so making multiple versions (i.e. Red/Blue and Time/Darkness) at the beginning or middle of a gen and then making a better version (i.e. Sky) near the end would just be too risky. Especially since a lot of people dropped the series after Gates, and Super seems to have only brought a handful back despite its gameplay improvements and callbacks to the older games.

And with such a niche audience to work with and rely on for sales, making a new PMD game every 2-4 years would be their best bet to not only not have their main consumer base feel too burnt out from too many MD games at once (since the gameplay even at its best is more repetitive than the main series and is a common complaint the series gets by many), but to also make sure their next installment is as polished as possible, with as much new information from the newest gen to work with as possible.

Like, look at how much content Sky added thanks to the additions Platinum had. I'd rather just buy one PMD game that takes advantage of everything they could from the newest gen rather than multiple PMD games that add onto each other thanks to the stockpile of new Pokemon, lore, moves, forms, and abilities that show up within the same gen.

(Though if Gates and Super got the same treatment Sky had with revisions to the story and extra content, those two would totally be liked a lot more among PMD fans. I just wish the developers would get this kind of thing down pat within the first draft without releasing another game that's basically the exact same thing but better.)",2016-09-10 08:22:55+00:00,d7gqyeg,1.0,t3_51z0lo,48651.0,MysteryDungeon
102,"Ahh, that's right! Thanks for reminding me. I now remember why the Gates partner was one of my favorites; he was the one out of all the other partners to actually show consideration toward *you* and *your* personal goals and backstory.

That isn't to say the other partners didn't care about you, but they never exactly bring your past up as much outside the beginning of every other PMD game, and their goals almost always seem to take priority over yours (for the most part).

I also liked how he was the most mature out of all the other partners. Rescue Team's cried at your good-bye and desperately wished for you back (though understandably so), Explorers' was constantly reliant on you to help him get things done and started off as a shy coward, and Super's was rambunctious kid (literally).

Gates's partner, on the other hand, already went through any conflict that may have detracted from his character off-screen (unlike Explorers where we see him grow throughout the game), and was already a developed character from the get-go. He just needed to realize his dreams.

And when you had to leave, he didn't break down into tears. He knew it would be heartbreaking for him and so did all your other friends, so he was the one to devise the plan to see you off with a smile as you disappear.

As much as I still dislike that everyone retained their memories after the credits, it still hurt to hear the partner was feeling off now that you were gone, but was still doing his best to go about his and everyone's job with a cheery attitude regardless. Poor thing was probably just as crushed as the other partners inside. (Explorers did this, too, for several months, but kept most of those interactions off-screen until he went to the beach to unintentionally reminisce about his time with you and break down then, which hurt equally as much the Frism scene).",2016-09-09 16:00:06+00:00,d7frurn,4.0,t1_d7fkhfw,10517.0,MysteryDungeon

104,"This definitely takes me back! I remember that day vividly. I had seen promos of the PMD special and commercials for the Rescue Team games on Cartoon Network and I was so confused and hyped at the same time, since it looked so drastically different from the main series games and anime!

I was in the 4th grade back then, eager to rush home after school, get my homework done, and hopefully reach the nearest TV in time to see it. I had missed the first third or so of the episode that night, which had disappointed me a bit, but the latter two-thirds got me wondering all about what this ""Mystery Dungeon"" world was like and what else it had to offer. I also remember it was that same day the dubbing companies for the anime switched and everyone's voices suddenly sounded terrible. I was worried for the voice actors thinking they must have caught a cold or something that should wear off soon, only to be disappointed learning these new voices stuck and were recast for the sake of spending less money. It was around that time where I would continue watching the anime on CN, but would start falling out of it just because the openings and voice acting suddenly felt a lot worse and I couldn't understand why at the time.

Anyway, back to PMD, the ""to be continued"" at the end of the special left me thinking there were going to be more episodes, but... There weren't? I would check as often as I could if they would at least show commercials of the next episode, but it never came. Then I promptly moved on from PMD until around December/Christmas-time when I was brought to the KB Toys that was at the nearest mall at the time, where shy 9-year-old me struck up a conversation with the cashier trying to ask what those two Pokémon games were behind the counter, where my parents would then give me the choice of buying one or the other. 

One was LeafGreen, and the other was Blue Rescue Team. One looked familiar, and the other I knew nothing about outside of that one special, and after mulling it over and hesitating how much of my money I wanted to lose (I was a super cheap spender then since money always came scarce, and that trait stuck with me even to this day with a job under my belt), and after a lot of thinking, Rescue Team was what I got with my hard-earned allowance. 

The cashier was cool. He knew I was super nervous when I approached him so he mentioned that his son was super into Pokémon too, and explained that PMD just came out a few months ago, telling me the gist of it and asking what my favorite Pokémon was when I was unsure of what game to get. Then he charged Rescue Team (which was around $35) for the price of LeafGreen (which was $15-20 if I remember correctly), and I remember that smile on his face when he handed me my receipt. 

He spared me a few bucks so I could enjoy my winter break with a new game and with a less empty wallet... And enjoy that game I did. ♥

And as for the points you found ""too stupid"" to even address, the least you could do was quickly put said lesser points up on-screen, typed out and refuted so we could at least read up on why you think the post-apocalyptic theory is invalid and why those lesser points don't support it at all.

I'm not saying beat around the bush and make long, drawn-out videos like some of the other theorists out there, since I like your quick-and-simple style, but it would help to be a bit more informative at times instead of outright admitting you didn't bother putting every bit of information you could out there so you could refute it.

I disagree with the PMD post-apocalyptic theory myself, but it does need a bit more work. I do like the video, however! I hope you continue to strive to improve.

It takes guts to outright refute a popular theory with your own solid evidence, and I respect that; you just need to elaborate a bit more, is all.

(Even Matpat refuted *that* theory, and tons of Pokemon fans still like to believe it to be true).",2016-09-05 05:04:47+00:00,d79y8zz,1.0,t3_5150qd,41100.0,MysteryDungeon
114,"Cofagrigus has a lot over-the-top reactions over every little thing, especially because of his obsession with gold. Always thought it was more funny than anything. Sunkern is an NPC in Super that lives in Serene Village that kind of does the same thing, with super crazy facial expressions and everything.

I liked Explorers' partner because I related to their personality at the time (I was like, 11 when T/D came out), so I cut them some slack there, especially because PMD games are sort of aimed for that target audience in the first place. I also give them more cred because Super's partner just *crumbled* when she was called annoying in the softest way possible. At least Explorers' partner just freezes up when he gets insulted and regrets not doing anything afterwards; Super's partner was only talked down to once in the entire game--by you, no less, with the most minced words possible--and she acts like she's just out of it for several days.

I understand what Super was going for there, but it just made the partner look...too sensitive, even for her age.

I can understand your gripes against the Post Town citizens, though. But I guess that was kind of their point--Gates makes it a point that a lot of people have become assholes, with Pokemon like Herdier, Leavanny, and Swanna being some of the only sane Pokemon left.

115,"I would personally relate HAPPI to the Pokemon Exploration Team Federation, the one Scizor claims he was a part of in Explorers and the one that's apparently in charge of managing everyone's Exploration Points, Rank, and rewards. Wigglytuff's Guild seems to be affiliated with said Federation, but we never really see anyone else besides Scizor that's an official part of it, while the Expedition Society seems to run its Expedition Points and Ranks all on its own through the Pokemon Nexus. The Pokemon Exploration Team Federation in Explorers seems to manage all teams and guilds across the Grass Continent, same with HAPPI.

Also, I think Slowking was the elder in the Adventure Squad games, not Slowbro.

Either way, here are my answers!

1. Wigglytuff's Guild &gt; Expedition Society &gt; Rescue Team &gt; HAPPI &gt; Adventure Squad. I just felt closer to the guild than I did with the Society; we were all apprentices on semi-equal footing working together to achieve our goals, while with the Society, the other Pokemon around were just our coworkers who had already achieved their goals along with us. HAPPI, if I recall correctly, is handled in a way similar to the Exploration Team Federation in that it just manages and establishes order to all teams and adventurers out there, and I've never played the Adventure Squad games, so I can't exactly say anything for sure about them, so from here on, I'm excluding them from my answers.

2. The Guild, for sure. The Society sounds nice, but it seems to be a place Pokemon go *after* they're well-trained and qualified-enough to become full-fledged adventurers, while the guild is where Pokemon go off to train to eventually graduate and *then* work either alone or places like the Society. That's why the Society is so relaxed compared to the Guild; the Guild trains you hard so you can take care of yourself when you're on your own or have a job someplace else. Rescue Teams sound self-employed, much like the hero and partner in Explorers after they graduate from the Guild, so I'm not too sure on that. And HAPPI and the other federations partially sound like desk jobs, having to account each and every team, their rank, their points, how many items they can carry, who enforces the laws and rules, etc. etc. 

3. I have no idea how strong Slowking is, but if we're talking level-wise, Ampharos (54-ish) is a higher level than Wigglytuff (50). Story-wise, Wigglytuff is constantly hyped up to have an ""amazing hidden power"" (i.e. a really strong Hyper Voice), but Ampharos seems to have an overall better moveset with better coverage. And Ampharos also has type advantage against Slowking.

4. Wigglytuff's Guild wasn't the most organized, and neither was the Expedition Society, since Chatot is a big softie when it comes to accepting and rejecting kids and Ampharos is no better (but Ampharos at least got to see said kids in action several times before making his decision). Wigglytuff likes to leave the guild unattended, risking intruders; Swirlix likes to eat everyone's share of food after or while she makes it... They both have their ups and downs. And the Exploration Team Federation isn't as strict on its rules as HAPPI is, so I'd have to say HAPPI would be the most organized here.

5.  I actually made a similar post a while back asking who would, between the Expedition Society and Wigglytuff's Guild, would win in a fight! https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteryDungeon/comments/49a9j5/discussion_expedition_society_vs_wigglytuffs_guild/ I have no idea what other Pokemon are in the Adventure Squad, and I would have to take a every Rescue Team in the Rescue Team games into account if I were to add them into this... And we don't have much of an idea what Pokemon are in the federation and HAPPI... So I'm going to keep this between the Guild and Society. The Society overall is more competent than the Guild despite being outnumbered by them, and they're all made up of full-fledged explorers, supposed ""experts"" at their assigned jobs (archaeology, sky exploration, sea exploration, etc.), with Ampharos and Mawile being higher-leveled with access to Mega Evolution.

120,"Welcome to the PMD fanbase! Glad you're giving these games a shot. [](#bulbasaur2)

I'm glad you're deciding to play the series in order; in my opinion, that's the best way to go since the gameplay improves and gets more user-friendly from there (with some exceptions of course).

Rescue Team is arguably the most difficult game in the series, mainly because of its lack of polish compared to the other games and its bias against Grass and Fighting-types.

Literally every boss in the main story is super-effective or resistant to Grass (except for one boss, but that boss's dungeon is filled with Fire and Poison-types so it's a moot point), and Fighting doesn't fare much better, so playing as any of the Grass starters or Machop pretty much puts you in a self-inflicted hard mode.

But that doesn't make the game impossible or *too* rage-inducing; I picked up Blue Rescue Team for the first time when I was 9, with Bulbasaur as the protagonist and Pikachu as the partner. I struggled and died a lot, but I managed to beat the game just fine for someone who knew nothing about Mystery Dungeon-style games before.

So the game gives you enough freedom to beat the game as whoever you want, but it's clear that some starter combos are better than others.

For example, some Fire starters (i.e. Charmander and Cyndaquil) learn Smokescreen, which is absolutely broken in Rescue Team and Explorers. It pretty much lowers an enemy Pokémon's accuracy to *zero* for a few turns (the game calls it the ""Whiffer status""). So you're practically invincible to all offensive moves, giving you the ability to land a few hits in with no consequences. And once the enemy's Whiffer status wears off, you can always just use Smokescreen again and rinse and repeat.

Mud Slap (learned by Mudkip) is pretty good as well, even at the final boss. Type immunities don't exist in Rescue Team and Explorers, so any type can hit any other type no matter what (i.e. Electric hitting Ground, Ground hitting Flying, Normal and Ghost hitting each other, all at the price of doing less damage). Mud Slap lowers an enemy's accuracy by 1 with each hit, so using it repeatedly can help you take down a tough foe (especially since the later bosses will be several levels higher than you, one or two-shotting you no matter how much you grind, some with pretty cheap moves). 

It's not as OP as the Smokescreen strategy, since you can never drop an opponent's accuracy to *zero* and it involves a bit of luck with you hoping the enemy doesn't kill you while you're trying to hit it with enough Mud Slaps, but it's still very useful against the main story bosses in my book.

You're also given the ability to Link moves in this game. I won't go into too much detail on that since the game explains it for you later, but linking moves can help a lot and gives you plenty of room for thinking up your own strategies for combo moves. (The game even gives you a few suggestions for each starter).

I never linked moves myself when I first played Rescue Team, but it definitely adds a layer of strategy to the game if you're into that. It's just a nice optional thing you can do for your team.

That's all I've got for now! Sorry if it's a lot to take in. I hope you have fun with the game! I also hope no one spoils it as well!",2016-09-03 02:54:04+00:00,d77llkh,1.0,t3_50wqwv,3543.0,MysteryDungeon

Like, having them get closer without any suggestive dialogue would be fine, but taking that interaction out entirely wouldn't have changed anything in the story at all and would have kept the gang more like a tight-knit family rather than one with a three-way love triangle added in last second and addressed for all of 2 minutes.",2016-09-02 08:12:13+00:00,d76ivs8,5.0,t1_d75x1q8,39987.0,MysteryDungeon
124,"I feel the same way. I loved how the plot added several more mysteries, drama, and action in its second half, but the pacing suddenly shifted into overdrive and we barely got to know any of the new characters, when we spent half the game getting to know a group of friends we already had in Serene Village, who developed and had better chemistry with but suddenly disappear off the face of the story once you leave it (with Espurr being the only exception).

But I guess since the Expedition Society is the MC's and partner's job, having Ampharos as their boss and the other Society members as their coworkers was bound to be a more formal, less close relationship than their peers back at the village. Maybe that's what the writers were going for, and why we went back to it to see your partner break down over it at one point after we return from the Voidlands.",2016-09-02 08:08:49+00:00,d76its9,6.0,t1_d76fveh,8889.0,MysteryDungeon
125,"PMD in general does a good job at making Pokemon that weren't too memorable or likable in the main series games and expanding on them greatly. 

Pokemon like Pikachu, Charizard, Mewtwo, Lucario, Eevee, and its evolutions, for example, will always stay popular and have been oversaturated in a lot of Pokemon media over the years--whether it be the anime, manga, main games, side games, merch, etc.

But Pokemon like Dusknoir, Wigglytuff, Gurdurr, Deerling, Nuzleaf...even a lot of the legendaries from later gens... They don't get much love outside of the gen they were introduced in, and even during the time their gen was relevant, some Pokemon just felt like they were there just to be there.

PMD changes that and adds character, personality, or even just more screen-time for less popular Pokemon, making more species out of the 720+ we have more memorable.

I already liked Chimecho thanks to James's Chimecho from the anime, and Ash's Grovyle had a cool streak for a while, too, but PMD only made me love them that much more.

Carracosta was also a Pokémon I didn't really see much of at all, even in the Unova games (since it was a Pokémon you could completely miss entirely if you chose Archen's fossil), and seeing its role in PSMD made it a very dear Pokémon to me. His letter hit me the hardest when we were about to leave Serene Village for the first time. I can never not imagine Carracosta as a fatherly Pokémon now.

-**Espurr:** Cute Psychic-type. Bipedal and has decent-enough coverage in its moveset (including TMs). Has range of emotions to use in its portraits to contrast its stereotype of being cold and emotionless.

-**Fomantis:** 7th gen Pokémon, so by default it has priority for a 7th gen PMD. It and its evolution, Lurantis, look human-like enough for it to work (even if they're based off mantises).",2016-08-30 18:52:37+00:00,d72y9im,1.0,t3_50cbqo,4892.0,MysteryDungeon
134,"Espurr was able to track down Pancham and Shelmet when they were kidnapped, provide a more detailed description on the blue flames and *how* they kidnap Pokémon, and showed everyone where they were taken, indirectly encouraging everyone to go into the Ancient Barrow to save them now that they know all this. Everyone else was scared to the point of passing out, and would probably have stopped their investigation of the school once they awoke, while Espurr remained perfectly calm and pressed further.

She later said, through dialogue given once you meet her in Lively Town, that she's been mediating information between Ampharos and Nuzleaf as they traveled across the world both looking for Pokémon to raise an army and looking for Pokémon to turn to stone, respectively. She discovered what Dark Matter is and what its goals are through this, and that's how Ampharos and Jirachi learned of it as well, while the MC and partner learned about it in the Voidlands.

Espurr then, under Ampharos's orders, chose not to tell the MC and partner that she was a double agent and to pretend Ampharos was nowhere to be found.

Pretending to ally with Nuzleaf, even when she went to the Prehistoric Ruins herself, gave Nuzleaf a false sense of security, and not letting the hero, partner, or the Beheeyem in on it would help solidify her alibi. This allowed Espurr to indirectly squeeze some more information out of Nuzleaf while Ampharos and the others his in the shadows.

It was a huge gamble on Ampharos's part--which he even admits and apologizes for--but that was what Espurr's role was meant for there.

That was her role in the story. Though you bring up a good point in saying some of the other characters didn't exactly have any major flaws as well; especially most of the Expedition Society. Espurr and Mawile are just singled out because they don't seem to portray any weakness in the entire game (or at least very little), while nearly everyone else does.",2016-08-30 18:40:50+00:00,d72xpsq,3.0,t1_d72n8ha,13694.0,MysteryDungeon
135,"When people say Espurr is a ""perfect"" character, they're referring to her actions in the plot and what we directly see of her in-game; *not* what might be implied or what we don't see of her from whatever backstory she might have.

If Espurr had a Special Episode confirming what she may or may not have had to go through in her past, and if it showed her struggle because of it, then yes, she wouldn't be a ""perfect"" character anymore, and she would have *earned* her competence over the other schoolkids in the main story rather than just arbitrarily being the best one.

(Much like how Sunflora and Loudred were made much less static characters in Sky thanks to Special Episode 3, and how Wigglytuff's competence as a top-notch explorer was finally shown in action in Special Episodes 2 and 4, when in the main story, they weren't exactly the most developed, and Wigglytuff being as good as everyone said he is was pretty debatable outside of the Brine Cave arc and that time he trashed Team Skull at Fogbound Lake).

Back to Espurr, she hasn't made a single mistake in the main story. She may be a little socially awkward/creepy (spying on and watching others from afar without them knowing) and introverted (preferring to stay alone despite her friends being outside and playing a lot of the time), but none of that has really detracted from what she does in the story. If anything, it only adds to her character, since her spying on others without anyone noticing proves useful several times in the story.

Even when she mentions not having any parents, it's only in *one* line of dialogue in the whole game, and she says it with a nonchalant smile on her face--the very same smile she gives when she nonchalantly says ""Sorry about that!"" when she apologizes for betraying you and siding with Nuzleaf so she won't get turned to stone. (Of course the latter was an act and a lie, but since she later says she didn't even care about turning to stone, she's practically fearless...)

We could have as many interpretations and headcanons of Espurr as we want, but it doesn't change that her few (canon) flaws don't detract from her character at all, and doesn't exactly confirm anything about her past, implied or not.

Whether she was just acting when she gave a cheerful smile talking about her nonexistent parents or not is up in the air. I like to think she was putting on a brave face as well, but with Espurr, you never know. This is the same girl that doesn't fear exile to an alternate dimension and potential death just because ""it wouldn't be very interesting"".

And this is coming from someone who likes Espurr as a character! I'd like to agree with you, but I also like playing devil's advocate here.",2016-08-30 13:53:30+00:00,d72kt6r,1.0,t3_50ayum,3448.0,MysteryDungeon

So if there were to be a 7th gen PMD, I'd imagine Spike Chunsoft would focus on adding S/M Pokemon into the game before all else.

I liked the guild in Explorers, and I also think the Expedition Society is pretty neat as well, but personally, I like how PMD likes to try something different in each game (story-wise), and Super definitely threw me for a loop with the amount of plot twists and trope changes they added to its plot.

139,"When I beat Blue Rescue Team, my first PMD game, when I was around 9 years old, I bawled my eyes out because I was so used to the usual happy endings the cartoons I watched or the main series Pokemon games and Mario games gave me. 

It was the first game I played that had any semblance of an in-depth story and characters that weren't as one-dimensional compared to the others I played. I grew up on Nintendo handhelds as a kid; no home consoles, had to earn the money to buy the games I wanted, so I never really got to play much outside of Pokemon, Mario, and the occasional Zelda, so I was really invested into Blue Rescue Team's story and characters, and having to leave the PMD world really crushed my heart at the time because it felt like *I* was leaving my friends behind, rather than a characteristic representation of ""me"" leaving some characters behind.

Seeing that message at the credits--that if I ""wish hard enough, I will surely come back""--made me try my damndest to hope and pray that I come back to the Pokemon world to make my partner and the other Pokemon I befriended happy again, making me cry tears of joy when I felt like my prayers worked when I was brought back after the credits.

I had never been so immersed in a game before, and Blue Rescue Team still stands as one of the games I was most immersed in throughout my entire life...but that was only because I was the game's target audience when I played it. Of course I would get the most out of it than, say, an adult with tackling a job and college who knows better and understands the tropes and writing this series portrays.

My parents had the most confused looks on their faces when they saw my face wet with tears over a video game back then lmao they were like ""what is wrong with this child""

---

Outside of that game, I didn't cry at the end of Explorers of Darkness when I bought that, mainly because of how similar it was to Rescue Team (with you disappearing and getting brought back). When I got Explorers of Sky a few years later, though, I legitimately cried again, because by then I had gotten old enough to appreciate how they objectively wrote this ending [spoilers](#s ""(with the player character talking out loud for the first time without parentheses, the use of the flashbacks, and the focus on your partner and the specifics of what he had to go through after you disappeared, etc.),"") and what set it apart from Rescue Team's.

Same happened with Gates's ending and [spoilers](#s ""the Frism scene, as well as the added plot point of everyone forgetting you after you left."")

Though I also had a bit of personal bias toward Explorers' ending once I beat Sky; it was around that time I had truly related to the partner. While I liked to imagine myself as the hero in Blue Rescue Team back when I was much younger, I had always felt a certain chord with Explorers' partner in that his personality was written in a way that made me empathize with him. Like him, I was also shy to the point of cowardice, reliant on other people to help me feel strong, and determined to better myself. And like him, I also made a really good friend I would rely on who later left to move to a different school, where I would never see him again (which isn't as bad as [spoilers](#s ""having him erased from history""), of course, but still.

Super's ending, though... I was spoiled on before I reached it. While a lot of the other plot twists surprised me throughout the story, I ended up reading a comment on YouTube spoiling the ending of the game. It didn't help that Super's ending relied a lot on shock value as well, so once I reached it, I...wasn't as shocked and dumbfounded as the game intended me to be. I might have gotten a little misty-eyed, but nothing more than that. I felt disappointed. I'm sure I would have appreciated it more if I was surprised by it.

Explorers sort of does the same thing. Your partner and Chatot say that the sudden influx of Mystery Dungeons cropping up is because of time stopping in certain places across the world at the beginning of the game, and never address that again.

Yet in both games, Mystery Dungeons continue to appear despite both the natural disasters being quelled and time being restored (as well as the space distortions being fixed).

The others were nice and got me hyped for the games when I was a lot younger, but the higher grade in animation quality and (slightly) better voice actors overall for these specials helped make it better than the others, even if Gates's were shorter. (I'm counting all of Gates' specials as one episode because of how much shorter they are than the others).

Plus, Gates just straight-up animated and reimagined cutscenes from the game, and interpreted them in a way that was still faithful to it! It was cool seeing the game's cutscenes come to life.

Explorers' episodes were good; Dan Green was great as Grovyle and made me see him in an entirely different light. I always imagined Grovyle to have the voice of a teenager, or at least someone not much older than the protagonist, but the more I listened to Green as him the more I started to think the voice really did fit him. Piplup's VA was great and Chimchar's fit well-enough for the same guy who also voiced Barry and Trip.

Also, some of the remixes and arrangements of the OST from the games sound pretty good!

156,"All in all, without the Pokemon themselves, the PMD series wouldn't be anywhere near as up-to-par as they would with any other JRPGs out there. The Pokemon are what made these types of plots work and added a whole layer of depth to the franchise as a whole; it would be difficult to rework them in a way that was devoid of Pokemon unless we either omitted/changed around a few plot points or changed them into say, real world animals at some points.

Sure, some of the themes PMD portrays can be a bit mature and dark for a children's game, but many other children's games, shows, and movies get away with so much more that PMD looks watered-down by comparison.

Not only is that the case, but the Pokemon are what make PMD stand out. Sure, the Pokemon label *may* what drives some people away from the series due to the stereotypically childish nature of the series like The Theorizer said, but it's also what attracts its target audience to the series in the first place. It's such a niche series that mainly thrives on the support of Pokemon fans, MD fans, and children (usually near, at, or slightly past their tweens).

It's an interesting discussion topic, though, and out of all the PMD games, I would say Super has the most re-workable of all the games in order to change it in a way that has no Pokemon. Though without the Pokemon, some forms of magic would have to be involved, i.e. time travel and petrification.",2016-08-19 05:37:11+00:00,d6nptgv,1.0,t3_4yeedm,34819.0,MysteryDungeon

The game also stops treating him like a story character right after your one cutscene with him and Articuno. Literally *right* after that, he's treated like an ordinary recruit, with no story dialogue, and if he dies in Mt. Freeze, you *never* see him again, and you'll have to recruit some other Absol elsewhere. You have to keep him alive at Mt. Freeze and *then* he'll stay a permanent part of your team.

I guess Absol was meant to be the game's way of giving you a crutch for the last stretch of the fugitive arc to try to make up for making every dungeon beforehand so difficult?

162,"Usually when people mention that they're missing a few connections in the Connection Orb, they're either missing Pokemon that are either Traveling Pokemon in a dungeon, or Pokemon that you can recruit right away simply by finding them and talking to them in the overworld.

I know for a fact that every single one of Rotom's forms (outside of the original) are Traveling Pokemon. Traveling Pokemon are Pokemon that you find in dungeons that also happen to be exploring the same floor as you. The game always lets you know that a Traveling Pokemon is either on the floor you're on, or on the next floor when you reach the stairs (saying 'there is still something up ahead'). Traveling Pokemon are easy to find and recruit if you follow the game's every warning whenever you do a mission or visit a dungeon, but if you truly *are* all out of missions, then visiting random dungeons might do the trick.

As for the rest, I don't remember, exactly. Some of those other Pokemon *do* seem like they'd be ones that are recruitable in the overworld, but even if they aren't, it doesn't hurt to check every town, village, and continent on the off-chance that they are.

Pokemon recruitable in the overworld have a red exclamation mark on both the map on the bottom screen and above their heads, as well as a speech bubble looming over them. They also have a random chance to appear in any place across the overworld; sometimes certain Pokemon don't show up at all. Doing missions and checking every in-game day can help try to see if there's a Pokemon out there wanting to be talked to.

BUT! Since you're also missing a few legendaries, I suggest going after them first. Defeating legendaries count as missions, and they can also trigger more Pokemon to want to give you even *more* missions on the Connection Orb, *and* they can cause some Pokemon in the overworld to *finally* want to join you. It's how it works--complete a mission, get more missions.

163,"Text speed is just a matter of preference. Gates's text speed is objectively slower than *all* the other PMD games, and the fact that you can't even customize how fast you want the text to be in this game makes me wonder why they bothered to slow it down.

Gates's text speed is paced just fine if you're reading the dialogue out loud; but for those reading it in your head it can get a little grating. I read much faster in my head than I talk fluently out loud, and many are the same, so each cutscene just feels artificially lengthened just because the characters are constantly beating around the bush (like they would in any PMD game) and doing it soooo sloooowly.

Also, I guess I can agree with your rationale for not minding the one-job-at-a-time thing, but it's just so...*inefficent*. Imagine going up to the Bulletin Board one day and seeing multiple jobs for the same dungeon...but *only* getting to do one of them per day. It makes no sense! I have to go to, say, Inflora Forest, five times in a row JUST to get those specific jobs done?! And some of those jobs in Inflora Forest have some of the materials I need to grind for something in Paradise! Why can't I just do them all at once?! I'm already there! It can't take *that* much more time to rescue someone for 5F and then rescue someone on 6F, can it? Besides, all these clients are Pokémon I've never met before, so they can *all* become my friends if they want! But let me rescue you all at once, dang it! Why is my protagonist so lazy that he only feels like rescuing one 'mon in a dungeon but doesn't feel obligated to rescue the other two or three suffering in the same area nearby?

It, again, artificially lengthens the playtime of the game and makes doing missions a slog. Ranking up in this game is pretty much 5x longer than in any other PMD game (which is saying something, because it still takes a while in Rescue Team and Explorers), and grinding for anything good in Paradise can take ages--longer than it needs to be.

Makes you a little sick of the same dungeon scenery over and over, y'know? But I guess if you're only playing for the story and not doing anything past the Worldcore, it doesn't matter *too* much, but still...

Bleck. Sorry about that.

168,"When I first played through Super, I always figured everyone in Lively Town was meant to be an equivalent to a lot of the Pokemon you got to know in Serene Village.

Like, Dedenne and Mawile taking up Espurr's role, the rest of the Society trying to replicate the chemistry you had with the other schoolkids, Krokorok and Krookodile being minor antagonists that would cause trouble every so often like Pancham and Shelmet, Ampharos being a bit of a parental figure like Nuzleaf and Carracosta...

But that didn't happen exactly happen the way I thought it would, and the entirety of the Expedition Society just kind of fell a little flat, even if they were basically Wigglytuff's Guild but more proactive in the story.

The game kind of fools you into believing the Pokemon you meet in Serene Village will stay relevant throughout the game, when really only Nuzleaf and Espurr really continue to stay involved in the story. It felt like a bit of a waste to toss all those character interactions with the schoolkids and villagers out the window, but I was open to see how the Lively Town Pokemon would try to replicate or make up for that loss...

And while they did a pretty decent job with what they had, they all still felt crammed in there because the story from Lively Town-onward felt so tightly-written and to the point that we had like no time to really get to know some of the more important Society members and towns-mons when we had all the time in the world to make friends with most mons in the village.

So that's why it felt a little refreshing to see Espurr again for some people, because while the schoolkids were just as static as the Expedition Society, we got to know and interact with them a lot more earlier on.

I agree that Espurr *was* basically used as a a plot device and plot twist fodder near the end of the game, though, and while I understand why people dislike her for that (as well as for other reasons), I still figure she's a likable-enough character for me regardless.

You're right in that I should've mentioned Cyrus's grandfather on Route 228; it slipped my mind, but I *did* mention the differences between Cyrus's and Lysandre's ideals and what they planned with their teams. I also wish I mentioned those in this post as well...but finding the video I made those comments on took a while.

It's all said in this video's comment section: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tlDYJaCO8I

The starting comment is made by CactusErebittsu (who has a Maractus as their profile pic) and was posted 11 months ago. All of my comments and analyses on the topic were under the name Nate River.

Also, Cyrus never showed any compassion to his Pokemon *on-screen*; I merely stated that it was *implied* he may have a bond with them because he has a Crobat, which evolves solely through friendship.

Crobat has often been used to symbolize a character's growth and development as a person, or to show a character's well-intentioned-but-extreme personality. 

Silver has a Crobat in your final battle with him, but has a Golbat in every single one prior, despite it being an extremely high level in your penultimate battle with him.

Maxie and Archie use Crobat to tell you that they aren't necessarily evil or bad people; they have good intentions, but they're just taking things way too far.

Cyrus also has a Crobat. Why? Who knows. Which is why I said that I figured he and his Pokemon may have shared somewhat of a bond in the past. Lysandre was much more blatant and emotional with how he felt about Pokemon; Cyrus refused to feel any emotion.

I do agree that XY's plot had a *lot* of good potential, but was wasted with bad execution. A Z version with revisions and edits would have made Kalos memorable and amazing. After all, that's just what Yellow (FR/LG), Crystal (HG/SS), Emerald (OR/AS), and Platinum did for their gen's regions. Pokemon seems to only be at its peak in writing after one or two rewrites of its stories.

And what you mentioned about Cyrus foreshadowing BW was interesting! Maybe not intentional by the developers, but definitely a nice headcanon! I agree with it wholeheartedly.",2016-08-16 09:48:55+00:00,d6ji30n,2.0,t1_d6iwfmk,41915.0,pokemonconspiracies

173,"One thing I loved about Gates's story is that it *finally* acknowledged the protagonist's potential human friends and family in the human world, and showed concern for them--but that's only because Gates's protagonist is the most self insert-y out of all the other PMD games.

Rescue Team's ending is a little unsettling now that I look back on it, considering the game makes you ""wish really hard"" to come back and stay in the Pokémon world forever, and you do just that, with no one asking or mentioning how your human friends or family must feel. (Sure, I may have fallen hook, line, and sinker for this ending as a kid, but now, as an adult... Ehhhh.) Though I personally don't think those implications are what the writers intended; Gates just took it upon itself to be more direct about that dilemma, and I respect it for addressing it.

Explorers made it so you're from the future instead, and since you already meet, reunite with, and bid farewell to your closest friends from the future during the main story, it's reasonable for the protagonist to want to settle down and stay in his current time with his partner, regardless of whether he still has amnesia or not.

Super's human situation I don't particularly understand completely, though. The human there was whisked away to the Pokémon world on at least two separate occasions; once in the Pokémon world's ancient past and another in the present. How old *is* this human, if he's stated at the beginning of the game to be *above* child age? I can't imagine he'd be that much older, but considering how long ago the past might have been, it's hard for me to tell. Does time work differently in the human world than it does in the PMD world?

I know the Ginji's Rescue Team manga treated the entire game as a dream, and Gates can potentially argued to be the same, but... It's still up in the air for games like Super.",2016-08-14 16:45:40+00:00,d6h7gjd,2.0,t1_d6gz95f,15722.0,MysteryDungeon

The Water Continent and the Sand Continent are both unique, but the Air Continent is where Rescue Team took place, the Grass Continent is where Explorers took place, and the Mist Continent is where Gates to Infinity took place.

Many other characters also cameo as well, like Gengar, Team Charm, Team AWD, Shiftry, Munna, Hydreigon, Ninetails, and many more.

I liked the cameos as well! Some of them were implemented pretty cleverly and have some funny and heartwarming interactions. 

And PMD doesn't reference the heroes from the previous games because everyone had different choices in what Pokémon they played as. That, and PMD is structured in a way that makes continuity difficult due to each Pokémon being named after their species...unlike in the main series, where the world is much bigger, humans have unique names and variation in design, and Pokémon have nicknames and can look different from one another. So the main series has room to extend and reference other games as much as they want...while PMD is more limited with this.

Oh boy. This one's going to be difficult for me, because I like the first four (Gardevoir, Grovyle, Hydreigon, and Espurr) a lot in different ways.

I'll just talk about my least favorite in detail and cop out by ranking my favorites here, from least to greatest (though they're all pretty close, honestly): Mew &lt; Gardevoir &lt; Hydreigon &lt; Grovyle.

**Mew:**

I don't *dislike* Mew's character and role in Super, but I wish it was expanded upon more, and I wish we were given more than what we were given in-game. Mew's a lot like Gardevoir and Hydreigon where she sent you to the Pokemon world to save it, but in my opinion, she did the worst job at it.

Why did she wipe your memories? Why did she let you *agree* to wipe your memories? I understand that this plot point is most likely just a direct reference to Rescue Team, where Gardevoir erased your memories because you asked her to, but Gardevoir's reasoning for going through with it made a *bit* more sense. 

Wiping out your memories (as well as her own) in Super...didn't. Purposefully giving themselves amnesia *just* so the two of them won't have to go through the pain of saying good-bye? What's the point of that, when the both of them *knew* that they were destined to stop Dark Matter a second time and were going to say good-bye anyway, just in different forms?

The human in Super knew they were going to turn into a Pokemon this time around and chose his and Mew's new reincarnated forms before they entered the Pokemon world again. He knew he had to stop Dark Matter with Mew at his side, but he and Mew decided to risk everything--the fate of the world--just so they don't have to feel sad over parting ways! That plan makes no sense, since they became best friends with each other again anyway as blank slates, and grew sad over having to part ways regardless. Their little ""plan"" to save the world by playing it by ear was pretty risky, and only worked because of a series of conveniences and coincidences throughout the first half of the game, like the Litwick deciding to mess around and indirectly teach the partner a lesson on how to truly beat Dark Matter for good. 

It also took away from the twist of one of the Beheeyem being the one who erased your memory. That twist made the villains look clever and calculating, as if they had this entire plan plotted out from the start from the moment you arrived in this world, but nope! Mew just decided to troll them and decided to have their memories erased at the exact moment the Beheeyem knocked you out.

I also wish we got to see what the ""real"" Mew was like. The one in the ancient past who acted as one of the top leaders when it came to fighting off Dark Matter. Time Travel Lake, Celebi, and the ancient past were brought up so many times throughout the game, I almost thought we were actually going to visit it when Celebi warped us out of the Prehistoric Ruins. Oh well.

**Villain:**

Same deal here. I like them all a lot, but if I had to pick a favorite, I'd rank them Nuzleaf &lt; Munna &lt; Dusknoir &lt; Gengar from least favorite to favorite.

**Nuzleaf:**

I'll try to keep this explanation shorter than Mew's. While Nuzleaf's twist was cleverly foreshadowed, and his introduction and role in the game was definitely a different, unique, and fun deviation from the usual set-up the other PMD games share, I wished he *was* responsible for having the Beheeyem wipe out your memory. It was great opportunity used and wasted just for the sake of last-minute shock value.

I'm also not sure how to feel about Nuzleaf being brainwashed the whole time. Like the rest of his role in the game, that part about him and the Beheeyem is different and unique, and them being mind-controlled pawns definitely set them apart from Dusknoir's and Munna's gang, but... I wish the game elaborated on how Dark Matter's brainwashing powers even *work*.

Dark Matter says that there is some of it inside *every* Pokemon, which is why it's the amalgamation of the negative feelings of *every* Pokemon in existence. And to fall under its control, Dark Matter takes advantage of the negative feelings that are *already* present in the Pokemon it chooses, so the Pokemon who's ""brainwashed"" simply has its inner evil exposed, and acts under Dark Matter's orders as if it was doing so of its own free will. Which is why Nuzleaf and the Beheeyem feel guilty and traumatized when they come to their senses.

But... Why are Nuzleaf, the three Beheeyem, and Yveltal the only five Pokemon Dark Matter is shown to be able to control? We were led to believe Espurr had fallen under Dark Matter's control (or at least betrayed us of her own free will), but it turns out that was a false alarm. We then see *no one* else working under Dark Matter (that isn't a Void Shadow) besides those five Pokemon. Sure, Nuzleaf, the Beheeyem, and Yveltal all had the perfect alibis to do the things they did throughout the story, but...still. It's just five Pokémon against the whole world! 

And knowing that Nuzleaf and even the likes of Yveltal were just *normal minions* in the end made the whole reveal at Revelation Mountain less climactic to me. Yveltal's a legendary Pokemon, and he did next to nothing the whole game! (Yveltal's big speech, while really cool, was made less significant when Dark Matter did the exact same thing and gave a similar speech near-verbatim.)

And seeing Nuzleaf, the Beheeyem, and Yveltal go feral and mindless in the final battle didn't feel earned to me. Almost as if we didn't see them do enough evil on-screen to really feel for them or feel unsettled when we see their mental state deteriorate further because of Dark Matter's control.",2016-08-13 07:33:56+00:00,d6fo0qz,1.0,t3_4xhl4x,11649.0,MysteryDungeon

178,"On your topic about the MC facing the same dilemma in the post-game, the game addresses this. It reminds us that the MC was willing to sacrifice himself when it came to stopping the destruction of time because 1. They weren't the ones causing it. And 2. They knew for sure their sacrifice would save the world.

In the post-game, the MC and the partner weren't sure if their sacrifice would actually change anything. They weren't given any real evidence other than the word-of-mouth of a legendary Pokemon they knew next to nothing about in their dreams. 

With the whole time fiasco, they saw the corrupted future, Dusknoir told them how and why he betrayed them, and the Time Gears were shown to not work in the areas they were originally placed in. That was proof enough to trust what Grovyle and Celebi had to say. 

With the distortion of space, aside from the message at Luminous Spring, there wasn't anything to support ""Cresselia's"" claims. That's part of why they were so hesitant.

It just goes to show that even the MC and the partner have a little Dusknoir in them, too. Even if they might be willing to sacrifice themselves for a noble cause that they know for sure will save the world, they still don't want to die.

Grovyle, on the other hand, seems to have no qualms with death at all, and seems content with what his death will cause.

A cutscene in the post-game shows this as well. The partner thinks about Grovyle, and if I remember correctly, it's that memory of Grovyle that convinces your partner to want to sacrifice himself for the greater good before the MC convinces him otherwise.

Grovyle's worldview was in the wrong in this instance. If the MC and partner had sacrificed themselves at that instant on Sharpedo Bluff, Darkrai would have no one to stop him from shrouding the world in darkness once more. Running away from death was actually the right thing to do, and it eventually got them answers.

This game really did a good job at showing the rights and wrongs of varying perspectives and world views. As did the other PMD games as well.",2016-08-12 09:53:52+00:00,d6ecmak,2.0,t1_d6ebwi0,2502.0,MysteryDungeon

It holds its own, but eventually gets knocked into the ice, barely able to move.

181,"To be fair, the world of the future is pretty hellish. Everything is frozen, it's pitch-black 24/7, resources are growing more and more scarce, more Pokemon are growing primal by the day, and Pokemon that are already primal are lurking about, wildly attacking others with no regard for anything else but their own survival, caring not for their loved ones or their past memories.

I can't blame the ""counsel"" and Grovyle for thinking that the best way to stop all this is to keep it from happening in the first place, even if it meant wiping out themselves and all the Pokemon that exist in their timeline.

Their options were to either let their world grow worse and to let other timelines share the same fate as them, or to end it all by killing everyone in their own timeline. All in all, I think Grovyle made the better decision in the long-run. Sure, some innocent lives would have to die in his time, but if the world continued to stay as it was, those few remaining rational lives would most likely grow corrupt and primal eventually anyway, and other worlds would be affected as well, so it was a sacrifice that had to be made.

Dusknoir's actions were reasonable and definitely more realistic, though; he was just afraid, and he gave himself the will to do anything he could if it meant living just one more day. Even if it meant doing horrible things to others. It's why I like him a bit more. 

I do wish we got to see Grovyle's ""counsel"", though. In Time/Darkness, I always thought he and Celebi were working alone, but in Special Episode 5 he mentions this whole group he works for that all agreed killing themselves by restoring Temporal Tower would be the best thing to do.",2016-08-12 02:48:00+00:00,d6e1sn6,1.0,t3_4xba43,2345.0,MysteryDungeon
182,"I almost 100%'d all of Blue Rescue Team when I was 9. Bought the game and beat it when I was 8. Then I beat Explorers of Darkness when I was 11, and Sky when I was 12. I'm 19 now.

Rescue Team *definitely* wiped me out constantly, but it's not like the game was so complex I didn't know how to progress. It was just ""beat the dungeon, do whatever the next NPC says, do some jobs, beat the dungeon, do whatever the next NPC says""

As for the dungeon and gameplay mechanics themselves, those...definitely took a lot of getting used to, especially when I was so used to playing the main series Pokémon games (heck, they were some of the only games I ever played in general, aside from a few Marios and Zeldas). But after a few months, they weren't too difficult, and I was ready to tackle the frustrating challenges and the steep learning curve the post-game offered.

I spent months playing Rescue Team, in short bursts between school, homework, and all the other things I did as a kid at the time, and I still remember the summer I spent grinding up to try to recruit and evolve the necessary Pokémon needed to recreate and play as Team Meanies.

Despite how difficult these games can be, they're still more than manageable enough to be completed by children, and combined with its childish dialogue and way of storytelling, its E-rating is more than justified, no matter how hard the games can get or how dark the stories can be.

I think a lot of people on the Internet have the habit of assuming a game, show, movie, or series *isn't* for children the moment it gets dark or hard for the average player, which is *not* a good or accurate mindset to have.

There are many children's mediums that *purposefully* get dark, mature, suggestive, or even somewhat profound while still *choosing* to identify as children's mediums. 

Just look at all these! http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids

So many YouTube comments assume that saying the word 'die' or showing a little mutilation or adding a subtle pervy joke automatically means something is unfit for children, when so many cartoons, anime, and video games (not like Call of Duty, I'm talking *Nintendo* games, mind you) do just that and much more.

As for gameplay, as unforgiving as it can be, many children have been able to beat PMD games and still enjoyed them, despite the challenge. While it *can* be difficult for *everyone*, that doesn't mean it'll be *impossible* for some people... Whether someone's 9 or 19, unless you're at a ridiculous age where you probably shouldn't even be playing video games like these to begin with (around 3-6 or bedridden at 100), you should be able to play a game like PMD just fine with enough determination. It's rated 'E' for a reason!

I'm 19, and knew many others who found the gameplay to be fair enough as children, and less difficult as an adult, partially *because* of our experiences with these games as children. 

In fact, I'd assume that newcomers to this series would have a *harder* time if they were *adults*, mainly because the majority of adults have less *time* to learn the game through long play sessions, because of work, college, errands, other affairs, etc., all of which consume much more time than elementary school and chores do. 

Children usually have a *lot* more free time to play these games and learn them backwards and forwards, and while some do have short attention spans, that isn't the case for a noticeable chunk of that demographic.

AHHH, this went on longer than I expected! I'm sorry for the long comment! I know I went off on a few tangents into the story rather than the gameplay, but...

**TL;DR:** I beat Rescue Team/Explorers at tween ages. Kids have short attention spans? #NotAllChildren

PMD is just fine for its intended demographic despite being difficult at times, even with its unforgiving gameplay. Newcomers of all ages will find it hard every so often but anyone can improve.

His video on Korra was more detailed with more elaborate explanations as to why he hates it in its entirety through a long four-part series, but his SU video is much, much shorter and just sort of dances around why he doesn't like it without keeping a consistent air of credibility. So it just looks like he's mainly trolling. Especially with that ending. His comments below tend to say otherwise, though.

I also agree with your point on fandoms. They're all born of a love for something, so saying one is ""toxic"" because of a vocal minority is just a hasty generalization.

He does acknowledge that SU ""has a fandom for hating the bad part of its fandom"" but goes on to trash it anyway.

190,"The Pidove in Serene Village is actually a wandering NPC; meaning they're irrelevant and are only there for the sole purpose of showing you that they're there and can be recruited later.

Pokemon that actually live in Serene Village and serve as towns-Pokemon there are Pokemon like Hippopotas, Raticate, Roselia, etc. But I understand what you mean!

Serene Village also has a Lombre, which is an indirect reference to the Rescue Team games (since it also housed a Lombre). Though they're most likely not the same Pokemon. Lively Town also houses a Murkrow, when Treasure Town also had a Murkrow that stopped by occasionally that was a part of Team Ebony, and those two are *definitely* not the same Pokemon, so I doubt that's even a reference or cameo.

So that's where this quiz comes in! Not only does it accentuate Super's story characters and cameos from past games, but it also gives those minor Pokémon a chance to be known.

210,"[](#bulbasaur2 )I like your analysis!

I always did think it was a bit contradictory for the game to constantly say that keeping a Time Gear in its respective place keeps time stable in huge chunks of the continent, only to later tell us that the only way to properly keep time stable in the entire *world* is to return them to Temporal Tower and leave the Lake Trio (and Ditto) jobless until the next potential temporal catastrophe.

The way I always rationalized this was that, when Darkrai said he had ""sabotaged Temporal Tower"" in both the past and future, he had ripped the five Time Gears from Temporal Tower, scattered them throughout the world, and altered time in a way--through his power of illusion and disguise--that caused the Pokemon of this world to be fooled into thinking that the Time Gears were essential to keeping time stable, *not* Temporal Tower. And since most Pokémon hardly knew Temporal Tower and the Hidden Land even existed, it was a nice attempt at giving the Pokémon of this world a false sense of security when their world is slowly but surely falling apart, day by day. No one in the past would have a clue of the real problem, and even if anyone *did* realize that the Time Gears weren't helping keep time stable, it would either be too late, or they wouldn't have any means to find out about Temporal Tower and the Hidden Land since so few knew about it.

After all, when we visit Temporal Tower near the end of the game, the only area of the tower that appears to be noticeably damaged is the broken stone tablet atop the pinnacle, where five hollow spots lay within it. The rest of the area seemed perfectly fine.

Time stopping and all of Temporal Tower collapsing was also a very slow, gradual process. So slow, in fact, that everyone blamed the destruction of time on the Time Gears being stolen in each area, which happened to temporarily stop time in the area they were stolen from *until* they were returned to Temporal Tower. Almost as if the idea of Time Gears being where they are serves no efficient purpose. [](#bulbasaur5)

As we see in the post-game, Darkrai doesn't necessarily always need a Pokemon like Celebi or a Passage of Time to time travel. He can create Dimensional Holes on his own, and can warp himself anyplace or anytime of his choosing. And when he's weakened, his Dimensional Holes grow unstable, making it difficult for him to warp to a time or place he wants.

So because of this, I feel a stunt like this is within Darkrai's realm of possibility.

I prefer your take on the Time Gears, though, and side with more of your points because of how much more coherent of a theory it sounds and how much more consistent it is to the game's lore than anything Darkrai himself had ever canonically done in-game.

(A lot of Darkrai's time-and-space-related abilities make no sense to me, given what his species is stated to be able to do in the main games; the Explorers games never did a good job with establishing what Darkrai was and wasn't capable of in my opinion. It always felt like he was written to just be capable of whatever the plot wanted him to be capable of for the sake of shoving his story arc into the post-game. But I digress.) 

Props! I love debating and ranting about stuff like this. It's fun to overthink about, even if the developers and writers themselves probably didn't think that deep in this game's plot themselves.

Like how Super Mystery Dungeon was basically ""X/Y/OR/AS"" Mystery Dungeon or ""6th Gen"" Mystery Dungeon before the official name of the game was announced.",2016-08-06 06:21:25+00:00,d66fbzy,2.0,t1_d66eddi,2458.0,MysteryDungeon
212,"I remember getting to read every bit of new dialogue you got for losing to a boss in Rescue Team during the my first playthrough, way back when, as a kid. Explorers and Gates not so much, and since Super gave you the option to restart from where you last saved without making us manually turn the game off and on again, I didn't even know Super gave different dialogue for each boss until I decided to lose all my items against Entei!

Turns out losing against Entei in your evolved forms allows you to go through the entire dungeon in your evolved forms without having to go through the Harmony Scarf cutscene all over again! I thought that was pretty neat, but now I wish I had done the same for every other boss in case there was some bit of humorous dialogue for returning to the end of the dungeon again.

Team Meanies definitely had some, since losing to them in Sinister Woods would get them to say that they ""conveniently fainted"" further in the dungeon right after they beat you and had to do it over as well. All the other other bosses just said some variation of, ""Hey! You're back! &lt;/repeated quote from last time/&gt; Let's fight!""

Also, a certain piece of dialogue tugged at my heartstrings during Super's post-game story. If you visit Serene Village with Mew following you around and enter Carracosta's house at that point, he'll confuse Mew for the partner at first, acting overjoyed to see her for a split second, only to look noticeably glum and apologize for his mistake, blaming it on bad vision and old age. It's a really easy moment to miss, especially since Carracosta tends to be noticeably absent a lot of the time whenever you visit the village.

That single interaction got me more emotional than the farewell at the end of Super's main story. I really wish we got to see more of Carracosta in the plot. He literally raised your partner her whole life--why wasn't he told about Ampharos's prank on you to help bring her back? I wish we at least got to see Carracosta's reaction to seeing your partner alive and kicking again before he turns into Shia LeBouf.

Oh, and another small detail! In Super, Latios and Latias were hunched over oddly when they were turned to stone. If you compare their positions side by side, it looks like they were embracing each other tightly right as they were about to be petrified by Yveltal. Makes their fate sadder than the game's dialogue made it out to be.",2016-08-06 04:30:54+00:00,d66cf5z,1.0,t3_4wed6x,845.0,MysteryDungeon

215,"It's actually called Revelation Mountain. Showdown Mountain was where Nuzleaf sent the letter to Entei to fight him and turn him to stone. 

Revelation Mountain was the one with the barrier and the betrayal. Either way, you're right. It's a scary thought... 

Though now that I think about it, the barrier needed a human, right? No legendary Pokémon could open it, and the only one who can fluently read the ancient writings to *find out* how to open it is your partner.

If Nuzleaf had just turned you to stone right after he found out you lost your memory, they'd have still been invincible. No one would have access to the Luminous Water unless a human broke the barrier.

... But then again, if you were taken down, someone like Hydreigon or Gardevoir would just send more humans to help. So I guess having Nuzleaf act as an ""ally"" makes more sense in the grand scheme of things.

Plus, it's not like Nuzleaf could read the ancient writings, so he probably didn't know only a human could break the barrier until your partner told him.

218,"The United States doesn't exist in the main series Pokemon world, either, yet they reference real-world animals, events, nationalities, and people to this very day. It was done a lot more back in Gens 1-3, but a lot of it was retconned ever since. Some real-world references still slip through the cracks, though.

Lt. Surge is referred to as the ""Lightning American"" in Red/Blue, as well as in the Unova games, in Black 2/White 2, where the region is *based* off the U.S. An NPC pokes fun at his title by saying that Surge is rumored to be ""from Unova"".

Several PokeDex entries reference places like the Eiffel Tower and Himalayas. Those were later changed as the series went on and strayed further from reality, but the fact that these entries *used* to exist still stands.

The anime used to show real animals and Pokemon coexisting together in the first few seasons, but now they make sure not to reference a single animal at all. Even the food the Trainers eat nowadays doesn't look as meaty as it did back then. They're still inconsistent with this every now and then, though, because Hau, the rival in Sun/Moon, has a catchphrase that metaphorically refers to chicken.

If the main series games get to pull these types of shenanigans, I don't think it's too far-fetched that PMD can do the same, albeit *much* more subtly. ",2016-08-01 01:39:25+00:00,d5z1e3h,7.0,t1_d5yxarb,6749.0,MysteryDungeon
219,"Darkrai is stated many times to prefer hiding in the shadows and rarely making himself known to others. He sabotaged Temporal Tower in secret, he distorted space in secret, he gave Azurill and Palkia nightmares in secret, and only ever willingly communicated with the hero and partner by pretending to be Cresselia.

So like your edit said, it's not farfetched for Darkrai to wait for the right moment to blindside Grovyle and the hero from out of nowhere while they were traveling to the past. The hero must have seen the attack (maybe not the culprit per say) and shielded Grovyle from it at the last second.

Grovyle obviously didn't see the attack, as all he ever says about the incident is that ""he and the hero ran into 'turbulence' while traveling through time and got separated"". 

Dialga, Dusknoir, and the Sableye probably weren't around at the time when Grovyle and the hero sneaked into the Passage of Time, so Darkrai must have heard of their meddling and decided to take matters into his own hands.",2016-08-01 01:32:04+00:00,d5z14gj,2.0,t1_d5yru0p,14984.0,MysteryDungeon

223,"The first bullet I wouldn't say was a plot hole. Just a random moment of filler. Golurk was just a huge, tough-looking Pokémon the developers wanted to make a boss out of with no relevance to the story. That whole fight is just a big-lipped alligator moment.

The second point about Quagsire was a joke. A bit of humor about his character. They purposefully made him drop an unsettling factoid about him only to gloss over it and never mention it again to make Quagsire look like he has a dark side. A number of sweet, lovable characters in fiction do this. Plenty of room for headcanon there, though--I just don't think it's a plot hole.

The last one is *definitely* a plot hole, though. I was confused on Hydreigon's physical stability as well. I personally think that was just a rushed, lame excuse for the writers to keep Hydreigon alive and keep him on your team.

225,"That's a valid way of looking at it, but I personally think the developers pick and chose what reappearances could be considered canon and what aren't. Since literally *every* Pokémon is named after their own species, it makes it difficult to determine who's who if more than one of the same Pokémon are present.

Like, say there were two Grovyle around that both had broody personalities. Unless one of them told you ""I'm from the future"", it would be impossible to tell them apart.

It's because of discrepancies like this that I like to think that certain Pokémon that show up as town NPCs in Super like Lombre, Snubbull, Teddiursa, and Ursaring are all *different* Pokémon, and not the same ones that showed up in past games. Their specific species and issues were just there to provide little references to past games for older players, not necessarily to act as cameos.

To support my take on this, the Murkrow from Lively Town acts completely different from the one in Team Ebony from Treasure Town. The one in Super constantly complains about her throat and acts much older than the one obsessed about shiny objects in Explorers. So that's one instance where reusing the same species doesn't always mean they're the same Pokémon.

Same with one point in Serene Village, where a Wooper, Budew, Smoochum, and Igglybuff all play together in the same formation all four Pokémon of the same species play in Sky's Special Episode 2, Igglybuff the Prodigy. Not a cameo, but a reference.

Other Pokémon, like Munna, Gengar, and Sableye, are clearly all the same Pokémon from the older games because they reference the things they did in the past or literally tell you who they are.",2016-07-30 21:14:26+00:00,d5xkxj3,4.0,t1_d5xkahw,1072.0,MysteryDungeon

227,"Super Mystery Dungeon kind of shows that Team Skull hasn't changed their ways very much, though. Skuntank is always in Capim Town now, which is a reasonable distance away from Treasure Town, and Koffing shows up there for a little while as well to give you a mission that tricks you into a Monster House. Beating that mission gets you connected with both Koffing *and* Skuntank.

Zubat's dialogue, mission, and place in the Connection Orb is unrelated to Koffing's and Skuntank's, though, so it's hard to tell if he's the same one from Explorers. Maybe Zubat left the team, maybe he has friends and family that are closer to him than Koffing and Skuntank are, maybe the Zubat in Super is a different Zubat entirely, who knows? That whole topic just delves too deep into headcanon and speculation territory.

Either way, they're still a bunch of bullies, to this day. They're just a little softer now, or at least know when to quit.

As for what I think happened to them after the Explorers games, I always imagined they just left Treasure Town for good, for multiple implied reasons:

* The partner sparing them and being nice to them after they got defeated by Kabutops messed with their conscience, making bullying him hard on their psyche.

* Same with the guild. Team Skull would have been knocking on death's door if Chatot hadn't knocked some adrenaline into them to keep them conscious for a while longer. And I'd imagine the rest of the guild must have helped heal their injuries the same way they did Chatot's as well, off-screen.

* Not only would they feel bad bullying the guild now as well, but I doubt they'd want to pick a fight with them even if they *wanted* to, considering how strong Wigglytuff is and how tough the guild can be when they're all together.

* Lastly, Team Skull must have surely heard the news that the protagonist and partner saved the world and beat Dialga in a fight. The only reason Team Skull picked on the guild was because they thought they were a pack of weaklings. Wigglytuff proved them wrong. The only reason Team Skull continued to pick on you and the partner after being beaten up by Wigglytuff was because they still thought you were weaker than them. Surely hearing that you saved the world and took down the embodiment of time must have made them realize they're out of your league now.

A Special Episode with them would've been cool, though! I can't imagine the writers ever intended Team Skull to be anything more than flat bully characters, unlike with Team Meanies, but I would've loved to see how they could've been expanded upon. After all, they managed to do so with Sunflora and Loudred...",2016-07-30 05:48:50+00:00,d5ww9sy,2.0,t1_d5wp1nq,14567.0,MysteryDungeon

Not every mission involved you being friendly with every cameo you met. Team AWD's mission called you out because they wanted fight you. Shiftry's triple-combination team from Rescue Team (Blastoise, Octillery, and Golem) wanted to fight you as well. As did Gurdurr's Timburr Crew from Gates. There were also a couple others that I can't recall but know were there as well. And *then* you connected with them.

I like that they mixed up the missions for each and every cameo. Wigglytuff's Guild's missions felt like a mini story arc and Grovyle's, Dusknoir's, and Sableye's missions had some endearing/funny interactions. Some teams wanted you to explore/rescue someone with them, some wanted you to explore/rescue someone *for* them, others wanted to fight you, some tricked you and led you into a Monster House...

231,"Some old dungeons (and references to them) do return. Jirachi mentions that he was born in Star Cave from Explorers of Sky, despite you not being able to visit it in Super. And Mystery Jungle, Zero Isle, and Destiny Tower are all still around as well (albeit drastically changed). Many dungeon themes, such as Amp Plains's, Crystal Cave's, and Great Canyon's, play throughout other random (albeit similar) dungeons across the world that bear some resemblance to their original counterparts.

Reusing more dungeons besides those would spring up a ton of complaints from people saying Super is just ""recycling content"", ""not bothering to think up new ideas for dungeons"", or ""relying too much on nostalgia to sell rather than originality and creativity"".

The same point would apply if they re-added the older towns as well, but to a lesser extent.

It would be difficult to add all of them because they would have to drastically change or remove some integral features from each town. The Banks and Storages would be replaced by Deposit Boxes; Spinda's Café, the Link Shops, and the Dojos would be gone; and making each town accessible via Lapras would be impossible because not every town from the previous games was by the coast.

Many older characters and NPCs have moved on from their lives and no longer run the facilities they used to. And adding in areas like the protagonist's house from Rescue Team (which was literally right next to Pokémon Square) and Paradise (which was literally right next to Post Town) would be an issue because the game would have to explain why the protagonists and partners from previous games are no longer around in those areas. Re-implementing them for the sake of visiting them would also feel like a waste if we can't *use* any of those older facilities to their fullest extent.

People would also complain that we'd be getting ""watered-down versions of the older towns, distorting and ruining their childhoods; that they just aren't the same as they remember and don't have the same feel"" because it would be impossible to recreate them *exactly* the way they were but with 3D graphics because of all those reasons.

With petrification, it's more complicated. The status entails stunning the Pokémon, like a form of paralysis. The traditional definition of the word (and the events of the story) entail Pokémon turning into stone.

238,"I definitely agree with your point about the continents. I was so disappointed that you only ever got to explore the entirety of the Water Continent (and a couple dungeons from the Air Continent and Sea of Wonders) during the main story, when the others had so much story potential.

When I first bought Super, I was expecting this long, expansive story that would go through each and every area for each arc of the story. Spending half the game in Serene Village during my first blind playthrough surprised me; it made me think, ""If we're JUST going to Lively Town now, how are they going to fit in the rest of the continents? The post-game has to cover them, then, like how Explorers' post-game focused more on world-building and fun, filler-esque adventures across different, unique parts of the Grass Continent rather than a serious plot.""

And while Super *did* make you go to the Sand and Grass Continents in the post-game, it was only for one dungeon each (albeit the dungeons you *did* go to were both really cool references to the first two PMD installments.) Super's post-game was longer than Gates's, sure, and I understand what it was trying to convey with you going through these hellish dungeons on your own to show that you'd do anything to get your partner back, but...

The game advertised itself as a tale filled with legendary Pokémon across the planet! I wished they gave more legendary Pokémon a bigger role in the story, and didn't just cheaply toss a ton of them in a couple dramatic cutscenes just to overinflate people's expectations in trailers. 

I was thinking we'd get to see at least a couple legendary Pokémon per continent, you know? I always felt that the story suddenly became *super* rushed after [spoilers](#s ""escaping the Voidlands."") Espurr [](#s ""being a double agent"") could have been played with a lot more, as could Ampharos's, Jirachi's, and [](#s ""Celebi's shenanigans around the world."")

I wish [](#s ""Yveltal"") played more of a part in the story as well. He only really showed up *twice* in person, and hardly had any unique dialogue ([](#s ""Dark Matter"") just repeated half of [](#s ""Yveltal's dramatic speech"") verbatim once it took his place as the main antagonist, so it just stole his thunder there). Sure, [](#s ""Yveltal"") was just a [](#s ""puppet""), but I wished we got to see how the legendaries would react to him betraying his own kind, since [](#s ""Dark Matter"") seemed to use him as a scapegoat to make sure no one knew about its existence and to distract everyone to buy time so it could kill the Tree of Life without any interference.

Like, maybe we could see [](#s ""Yveltal"") turning Lugia to stone after we tried to find him for help, and that would be why the three Legendary Birds show up in space without him near the end of the game to try to avenge him. That way we could see why [](#s ""Yveltal"") is such a threat and that he *isn't* just all talk. Most of what he does is off-screen; talking to himself in the beginning of the game about getting stronger, petrifying Latios and Latias, shrouding the world in darkness only to warn everyone about him, etc.

I really wish more of Serene Village's cast was more relevant throughout the story, too. It was a shame to bond with the schoolkids only to have one of them stay important. It felt like a waste to see them go when we spent so much of the game with them, watching them develop and having good chemistry with them (better chemistry than we had with the Expedition Society, even).

The post-game was decently paced at first, but then suddenly *RUSHED* itself into overdrive when [](#s ""we're suddenly knocked out in Serene Village for no reason and given a ton of new information out of nowhere, as if the writers were like, ""Alright, this game comes out in a couple months, let's just wrap this up and say this entire plot line was a prank."""")

It was only added in for the purpose of advertising the Rescue Team games and the first PMD special, though, nothing more.

Other Pokémon anime openings do this type of thing, too; a later opening advertises the Manaphy movie in a short clip, as well as the later movies, for no other reason than to let the viewers know they exist and are out right now.

243,"Ouch. That summarizes a lot of my love for Rescue Team in a nutshell. I agree with a lot of Explodinator580's points, as those are why I love RT as well, but I still love Super for the same reasons he hates it. I *like* how each PMD game feels like a somewhat separate experience gameplay-wise, and Super was fun for me in a new and refreshing way that, at the same time, reignited a familiar sense of nostalgia in me through the overworld, story, and characters.

I admit my biases toward Rescue Team, as well as why I enjoyed them because of the age I was and the mentality I had when I first picked it up, but there are still a few points I love about it that still hold up in my jaded, older mind. 

I may not be the biggest fan of the old RNG recruitment system nowadays (especially with how bad my luck was with it as a kid, jesus how did I bother dealing with beating Buried Relic 7 times only to see Mew in transformed form ONCE and not recruit it), but I still think Friend Areas are a neat, world-building addition despite being harder to run through for a specific team member, and I still think running around the overworld as any Pokemon you want is really fun (though Super makes up for this by allowing you to do this in Pelipper Island; not the same as wandering each town but it was the best they could do considering size limitations, NPC dialogue, and overworld space).",2016-07-26 05:38:35+00:00,d5r4opl,2.0,t1_d5r032g,8051.0,MysteryDungeon

Little did I know that the game would toss almost everyone you met in Serene Village to the wayside in favor of everyone in Lively Town...

I like the Expedition Society, but I do wish the schoolkids were more relevant throughout the story and acted in a similar manner the way Gates's group did. Each kid had their own little arc or clever quirk or noticeable personality trait, and you got to know them well enough.

247,"Of course it's bad to make a series overly-repetitive and formulaic, but what I meant in my last comment was that the 'Mystery Dungeon'-style gameplay is exclusive and a staple to the 'Mystery Dungeon' series as a whole.

Asking for different gameplay is like asking for a different spin-off series entirely that just happens to PMD's story elements. It would still be a game that takes place in the world of Pokémon, but it couldn't be labelled as a 'PMD' game.

I'd like some variety as well, but the series would have to be under a different name if it were to change *that* drastically.

Gates tried making its dungeons more unique by adding little areas where you could explore certain dungeons' overworld maps while battling enemies, but it felt wonky and they didn't do it very often. Super didn't use that at all and instead stuck to changing around story tropes by using them in less-expected ways.",2016-07-24 15:32:14+00:00,d5osw6z,3.0,t1_d5okef8,24486.0,MysteryDungeon
248,"I agree.

PMD has plenty of mature and dark undertones, but it executes like 98% of them in a way that's so PG and childish that it's almost insulting. Some of these implications--such as being coerced into committing suicide, being executed and sliced into ribbons, loved ones turning savage and primal/dying or going insane from malnutrition/turning to stone into a desolate hellscape filled with monsters pretending to take the form of your dead friends trying to kill you and take your body--are all pretty messed up, but they're executed in a way that's too sugarcoated for my tastes.

Hell, the writers didn't even have the balls to use the word ""die"" until the fourth game, and they only used it for a tree of all things. Sure, [spoilers](#s ""Xerneas was the Tree of Life"") , but not many of us knew that for sure on our first blind playthrough, did we?

PMD has a few similar tones as Undertale, with the whole ""never give up, stay determined to follow your dreams"" type thing pushed onto you in every installment, but I doubt PMD could do anything akin to the whole 'saving' and 'resetting' thing, or having characters remember your attempts at killing or pacifying them.

Having a different gameplay style would be nice, but then it just wouldn't be 'Mystery Dungeon' anymore. That's why it's named PMD--the Mystery Dungeon games all have this style of repetitive, brutal, dungeon-crawling madness. Whether it's Pokémon, Chocobo, Etrian Odyssey...

249,"That's because all of Sky's ads and promotional scenes assume that the majority of people watching them have already played Time/Darkness. T/D were only released about a year before Sky, so the press may have decided to animate and reveal some of the twists T/D kept hidden at the time for fan service, while keeping Sky's *original* content hidden (for the most part).

Having a special about Sky Peak would spoil one of the few original story arcs Sky had to offer that differentiated itself from T/D, so even if the Sky Peak arc had nothing to do with the overall story, it would just be a waste to reveal a huge chunk of one of the only major pieces of *new* content they added to the game.

So they animated an adaptation of Chapter 19 from the main story instead, to attract PMD veterans to see one of the most beloved chapters of the game come to life. They also chose that chapter specifically to also increase hype for Special Episode 5, which Sky put its most effort into building up through ads and promotional art, pretty much reminding everyone, ""Hey, you guys never got to see what happened after Grovyle went back to the future in T/D, but if you buy Sky, you'll find out!""",2016-07-21 09:14:04+00:00,d5kr2aq,7.0,t1_d5jzup5,47730.0,MysteryDungeon

But I edited my comment to say ""or at least acknowledgingly implied"", because I realize now that the Connection Orb isn't the most accurate thing on the planet, and the way it pairs Pokémon up are either the result of 4th-wall breaks for older PMD players or off-screen occurrences that happened between some of these characters.

253,"That would definitely explain why Wigglytuff knows them, but that little detail was definitely something I hadn't noticed until now! Clever on the developers if that was intentional (in Sky, at least). But it's probably not, and it at least makes for a good headcanon! Roserade *is* the only one that mentions Wigglytuff, after all. And PMD usually likes to make almost every story-involved Pokémon act as if its the only one of its kind. Like what they did with Drowzee in Explorers, treating him as if he's the only Drowzee in existence.

Usually it's hard to tell whether certain Pokémon of the same evolution line/species are the same ones that appear in other games/episodes, because the PMD series is super inconsistent with how they want to handle writing each and every Pokémon into their world, especially when every Pokémon of the same species is named the same thing. 

Like the Murkrow from Team Ebony vs the Murkrow with a constant throat problem in Lively Town. Or the Lombre from Pokémon Square vs the Lombre from Serene Village. They're most likely not the same Pokémon, so they just happen to be ones of the same species.

Though I personally think the Ampharos and Mawile in Super are confirmed to be the same ones from Sky Peak in Explorers of Sky because they share a connection with Jirachi, the very same one from Star Cave in Bidoof's Wish. They were both on the Grass Continent during Explorers of Sky, so maybe Mawile left Team Frontier to hang with Ampharos after Spinda decided to quit the café business and ran into Jirachi along the way.

261,"Hmm... There's also Stealth Cavern, whose mission was kind of interesting. You have to escort a Shedinja through the dungeon, but Shedinja kind of blends in with the dungeon background, making him a bit hard to see at times. Hence the dungeon's name. The dungeon background here is also one of the less-used ones, so I give it props for not looking too generic.

I just wish the Pokémon in this dungeon also went along with its mission's theme. They could've had Baltoy, Sandshrew, or the Geodude line show up to blend in with the surroundings as well, the floor's a light brown and the walls are a few shades darker. Or maybe they could've had ninja-based Pokémon show up like Ninjask, because ""stealth"". Huge missed opportunity there. Enemy Froakie show up, but that's probably the only Pokémon put in that even remotely fits the dungeon's name.

Otherwise there's Pumpkaboo Forest, which I only really like for the name alone. Having enemy Zoroark show up and pose as Pumpkaboo every so often was a fun choice.

Spiral Vortex is also a weird one. It has a unique (or at least semi-unique) dungeon background, and looks nothing like I expected. I despise how hard of a time I had going through it, and I question why the dungeon was named that way when it looks very little like a vortex (or an interpretation of a vortex) of any kind, but it makes me wonder why it's in the Grass Continent of all places. It doesn't even have a treasure at the end! 

Zero Isle is also a nice callback to Explorers, only it's only one dungeon, 10 floors, and with no restrictions now, and *much* easier than it was before. It also houses Giratina for some reason, and has a red, magma-filled background that makes it stand out. I guess the developers were trying to play off that playing through Zero Isle felt like a hell on earth for many in Explorers, and now it just *looks* like hell without all the difficulty that came with it.

Some of these dungeon names, themes, and backgrounds really make me wish some of these irrelevant dungeons had a place in the story. I feel it's a bit of a missed opportunity to use names and gimmicks like Spiral Vortex, Pumpkaboo Forest, Stealth Cavern, and Ghost Island only to not use them to their full potential and never use them again.

And how the entire dungeon is just *crawling* with Ghost-types, some savagely beating up Shedinja in an attempt to get stronger to beat you.

The use of Calm Craggy Area's theme works well in this type of landscape, too! And the fact that the island looks transparent and luminescent on the world map makes it stand out from many of the other dungeons aesthetically.",2016-07-15 15:20:45+00:00,d5dduzo,4.0,t1_d5d70nv,11626.0,MysteryDungeon

It would also bring the question of where the Gates protagonists are, since they run the place.

Swanna no longer cooks at Swanna House, for example. Banks and Storages are replaced by Deposit Boxes. Linking facilities and Scraggy's Savvy Moves are replaced by Hawlucha's shop.

People would complain that we'd be getting watered down versions of the original towns if we got the previous towns as DLC.

As for your preferences toward stories like Gates' and PokePark 2's, I can see where you're coming from! I haven't played any of the PokePark games, but I do like stories that put a good emphasis on character interactions and writing a solid, relevant main cast while still keeping the main plot coherent and linking everything together.

It's why a lot of people like anime like One Piece over shows like DBZ and Naruto (I know, so mainstream, ugh, Espurr, you have trash taste in anime). In One Piece, the main cast is roughly on equal terms, with each arc focusing on each main character's backstory and their development, much like it is with the main cast of Gates to Infinity. The team dynamic and chemistry between everyone feels more real and fleshed out.

In shows like DBZ and Naruto, the team dynamic is still there to a certain extent, but at the end of the day, pretty much every character that isn't the main protagonist and secondary protagonist is rarely useful, they're rarely developed, and they're just kind of...there, and contribute very little to the story (at least, when put in comparison to the main and secondary protagonist). This sort of dynamic is kind of what the Rescue Team and Explorers games have. Everyone's *there*, and they do help a *little* on occasion, but at the end of the day, the only ones that really matter are the protagonist and partner...while in Gates, everyone in the main squad plays an important role and the climax of the game would not have happened if *everyone* didn't pitch in.

There's nothing wrong with liking stories where almost *every* significant character is developed and has an established personality, but I personally think there's nothing wrong with stories that have an even amount of both static characters *and* dynamic characters, and for Super, Espurr just happened to be one of the former rather than one of the latter.",2016-07-13 00:12:06+00:00,d59xr18,3.0,t1_d59hhxv,22188.0,MysteryDungeon
271,"To add onto Soniclink137's point, the same applies for the characters in Explorers. None of Wigglytuff's Guild are given very much development, and Grovyle is made out to be a stoic character (at least from the player's perspective), but when you see them and their actions in Sky's Special Episodes, they're given a lot of extra depth and elaboration on their back stories and personalities.

We find out how humble Bidoof can be, despite him wanting desperately to improve as an explorer, when he gets the chance to wish for anything he's ever dreamed of. We also get to see how much of a burden he can be because of his inexperience.

We see Sunflora and Loudred act more than just walking, talking verbal tics, and see how they and some of the other Guild members interact when the protagonist and partner are exploring on their own. We find out Loudred can be brash and likes to jump head-on into dangerous situations too quickly (even when he might not be strong enough to overcome them) and Sunflora tends to deny things to be her fault and reacts through fits of anger even when she doesn't want to. They're not just ""I YELL A LOT"" and ""Oh my gosh!"" here, unlike in the main story. They were more than that.

And Wigglytuff, whose competence was debatable in the main story, was elaborated through his actions as a child prodigy and through his helping Team Charm as an adult. While it was hard for me to see whether Wigglytuff was truly as amazing an explorer as everyone says from the main story alone, the episodes really helped me see the prodigy he really was.

And now Grovyle, who we see as a near-perfect, stoic character in the main story...kind of stays that way in Special Episode 5. But here we see *why* the dark future has molded him that way, and *why* he acts the way he does because of the ideology he leads. We also see his impatience and hastiness that Celebi keeps talking about, in action--despite making sure Dusknoir is kept in check and on his toes at first, his impulse to rush and do what he needs to do without thinking too far in leads him to trust Dusknoir too quickly, surprising even him when Dusknoir turns on him and almost kills him. We finally see the one flaw Celebi mentioned about Grovyle finally fatally work against him, proving that he isn't as perfect the main story makes him out to be.

Sure, Grovyle still manages to talk Dusknoir out of it, but still.

My point is that, like Soniclink137 said, we don't get to see or learn everything about the characters we interact with during the main story. The same could be said for all of the other PMD games, including Gates (and there have been enough posts on this sub commenting the Special Episodes Gates *could* have had as DLC--just look at Munna, who was a very important character to the story but got no backstory or specific reason for why she did the things she did, unlike Gurdurr, or Virizion, or even Kyurem, who despite being legendary didn't have as big a role as an antagonist as Munna did but got a bit of a backstory anyway).

Super and Rescue Team didn't have any Special Episodes either, so the writers had to work with the limitations they had. So, like he said, for all we know, Espurr *could* have some underlying flaws we don't see, as could Mawile and the other perfect characters in these stories.

But since none of said possible flaws are present in the main story, then Espurr is stuck being a great character than an amazing one, much like Explorers' cast was. (Though, perfect or not, Espurr is still arguably my favorite character in Super; and that's saying something, because I usually dislike perfect or near-perfect characters).",2016-07-12 17:18:09+00:00,d59fdo3,1.0,t3_4shn08,5724.0,MysteryDungeon

He just talks like any normal Lucario would, constantly talking about aura, both in the Overworld and when he wants to talk to you to join your team.

Almost every other cameo in this game makes some mention to their role in the game they were originally from--heck, even the Graveler from Team Charm's Special Episode makes an appearance in Super, saying something along the lines of, ""I may not look like it, but I'm an explorer! Gahahahaha!""

Gengar's dialogue and recruitment mission only very, very subtly shows he's the same one from Team Meanies, but honestly, if the translators had written his original laugh correctly (""Kekekeh!"" instead of ""Hee-hee!"") then it would've been pretty obvious.

Plus, Gengar's already on one of the promotional posters of the game, right next to Ninetales and Gardevoir, so that alone already confirms it.",2016-07-11 19:48:00+00:00,d589w71,,t1_d569f7q,145740.0,MysteryDungeon

275,"I personally liked Super's ending, but from what I've heard from some people, some just didn't like it because it relied too much on shock value than on writing an actual, coherent ending...because once the ""shock"" dies down and you rewatched the ending knowing what happens, it doesn't have that same effect. With Gates's ending and Explorers' ending, it isn't as reliant on shock value because their endings focus more on the farewells between you, your partner, and each of the characters you've met throughout the game. Super's ending just focused on the surprise and shock of the farewell by throwing tons of things at you at once so quickly.

I was spoiled about the ending plot twist before I could finish the game, so knowing said twist definitely took away a chunk of my investment there, but I still liked it for what it was regardless.

But the fact that it was all done so soon and suddenly with a long exposition dump filled with new, somewhat convolutend information kind of made it feel less like a tear-jerking good-bye and more like a long explanation of what *really* happened that caused the game's events to happen and why said plot twist has to happen. 

But I understand what the writers may have been trying to go for, with the protagonist being aware of the usual good-bye trope much like most players of the game are, only to be immediately slapped in the face with something that'll most likely throw blind players for a loop, and for what it was, I enjoyed it. I felt a bit sad myself, and I was glad the writers tried something new.",2016-07-11 19:29:48+00:00,d5892g2,2.0,t1_d587yj3,1460.0,MysteryDungeon
276,"I realize that those other characters speaking in parentheses may not apply to how the protagonist speaks, but then looks at this video: https://youtu.be/biq65ThK8fM

At around 8:27, the protagonist turns to Espurr and says, ""(I can't really say anything about it...since I don't remember that time myself.)"" Espurr responds and says, ""It doesn't remember whether you remember it or not..."" and goes on to compliment him. While that *could* be interpreted as Espurr just using telepathy to read his mind, the partner acts as if she heard everything both Espurr and the protagonist said just fine.

There are a pretty noticeable amount of moments like these in the game. Most of them are asides and whispers, but there *are* a number of moments where the protagonist talks out loud directly to other Pokémon.

So saying the protagonist has no ""spoken"" lines at all would be inaccurate...but going through the entire game to specifically find each and every line that he *did* speak out loud would be hard to measure.",2016-07-11 19:22:56+00:00,d588r38,4.0,t1_d587x1m,1104.0,MysteryDungeon
277,"&gt;Not a single speaking line came out of the player at any point! Not even one line! I've had people tell me that the player did say things at some point - if anyone reading this thinks that way, I challenge you to find a quote from the game which the player says out loud, meaning it wasn't written in parenthesis.

In PSMD, parentheses doesn't *always* indicate talking in one's own mind. It doesn't matter if a character is speaking with parentheses or not; most of the time it *does* mean they're just thinking to themselves, but there are some cases, like around 11:22 of this video: https://youtu.be/1S6i3iVzMSg 

Shelmet and Pancham are speaking quietly to each other, and their text uses parentheses to signify that they're whispering. They're not telepathically communicating or anything. 

And then look around 12:20. The Drilbur there speaks in parentheses, as *if* she's thinking to herself, but she isn't! She's either thinking out loud or feebly and weakly responding to Chikorita! You can tell she was actually speaking out loud because Chikorita turns to and responds to her.

And then around 13:49. Now *two* of the Drilbur are speaking in parentheses, yet the two are clearly responding to one another. The parentheses is used here to show that these two Drilbur are speaking to *each other* specifically and not to the player or partner. The two Drilbur are talking amongst themselves while the third Drilbur is distinguished *without* parentheses to show that he's speaking to the player and partner. And once the player and partner enter the mine, they all *stop* using parentheses altogether.

See, you can't just oversimplify the text by assuming *every* line of dialogue said in parentheses is *only* said in thought. I know that's the traditional way to go about it, but Super doesn't seem to do that. It's really weird, inconsistent, and inconvenient to read sometimes, but it's not the hardest thing to get the hang of reading properly.

And these are just a *few* examples I mentioned, including the ones said by myself and a couple others that include the protagonist speaking out loud through parentheses as well, in past posts.",2016-07-11 17:48:12+00:00,d584fmd,2.0,t1_d5832jr,1789.0,MysteryDungeon

282,"It's also like asking why Shadow Lugia has different color scheme from regular Lugia. Its color scheme was reversed to show Lugia's corruption (and to make an appealing new design to attract people into buying XD). 

Prinal Dialga is the same. With the darkening if the world, Dialga was also filled with darkness himself, hence the darkening of his color scheme. The orange also looks like an unhealthy contrast compared to the normal lighter blue streaks glowing on his body--which, like intoxicatedw4lrus said, indicates Primal Dialga's current mental and physical state because of the collapse of time. He's become so animalistic and blind that all he knows is basic instinct to survive. It's why you never get to hear him speak actual words (like with the Snorunt, Glalie, and Mamoswine you also meet in Special Episode 5, who were also off the deep end as well, but because they didn't have a physical and mental connection with time, their sanity remained for far longer, and their bodies didn't change).

Luckily for Palkia, though, space apparently isn't as easy to collapse, since his home isn't as fancy as Dialga's, and he doesn't rely on gears to do his job for him.

283,"Everyone will give you a different answer for this question, so it's not too helpful to ask around online, since the PMD fanbase seems to be undecided as a whole on their opinion on Super, while still having solid opinions on the other games.

AriSai pretty much hit the nail in the head, though. There have been many, many people asking this same questions and while a decent chunk of people that lived or at least had a decent time playing the game, there were enough people that *didn't* that make it hard to tell whether the game is worth picking up or not to the average consumer/Pokémon player.

It really depends on what you're looking for, really. Some people in this fanbase are hardcore PMD fans/people who just like replaying the games over and over or playing for hours on end. Others just like a game that's long enough to be worth the price but concise enough to not drag on too long. Some people over analyze the stories and characters and critique it heavily; others don't care as much and just want to have a good time breezing through the plot playing as a human-turned-Pokémon again. Some people are nitpicky about change and the new gameplay elements it added; some liked the changes and new elements and thought it was a nice change of pace. While a *lot* of people liked the game and remained on the more positive half of this spectrum, there's a pretty vocal minority that likes to voice voice why they feel otherwise. Not that that's a bad thing; as long as it's done civilly and with reason, it's fun to debate different opinions every so often.

As you've seen already, there are already a few comments with conflicting opinions from each other. The other threads posted in this sub asking this question have many more.

AriSai pretty much summarizes the positive side's consensus pretty well. I enjoyed Super, too, for many of my own reasons.

Undyne is the head of Asgore's Royal Guard, and is very close to Asgore; she highly respects him above everyone else. Asgore and Toriel used to live together. Bergentruckung (Asgore's battle theme) references both Heartache (Toriel's battle theme) and Spear of Justice (Undyne's battle theme), two people he holds very dear and connects with. Undyne lives in Waterfall; Toriel lives in the Ruins; Asgore lives near the barrier, where his home looks near-identical to Toriel's.

I'm no musician, so I feel I have no say on how this works because of my ignorance on arranging, composing, and having little knowledge of music theory, so I don't feel at liberty to talk or argue against something I don't know very much about or something I know I can't explain coherently with the proper terms, but I do agree that it does get a little ridiculous. 

So many remixers/arrangers like to shove the Time Gear/Primal Dialga theme into nearly every PMD remix. (Or just any remix in general). It works fine enough for me if they use that motif for a good-enough reason--say, the melodies are similar or the two tracks being compared have similar contexts in their games--but when neither of those are the case it just feels a little forced.

Don't hate for mentioning this ""stupidly overrated, cancerous-ly fanbased, disgusting walking simulator of a game"", but Undertale does a great job at rationalizing every single motif it uses for nearly each and every one of its tracks. Every track relates to another in a way, and for good reason, whether subtly or not.

Every single one of Super Mario World's level themes--plains, athletic, underground, underwater, ghost house, bonus stage, and castle--as well as other tracks like the title screen and some cutscene themes, all use the same motif in different, creative, varied ways.

Also, people like to use the Time Gear theme over and over in their remixes because it's popular, or because the remixer really likes the theme themselves. Nothing too wrong with that; it's a small pet peeve with me. Nothing to get worked up over. Same thing's been happening with Undertale references from many of its themes in many different remixes of many different games.

The other PMD tracks and motifs aren't as popular, known, or liked, so they're not used. Simple as that.

If you want to avoid their channel, that's fine, but I still like a lot of remixers who do this despite it feeling a little weird for me. If I don't like a small part of their remix, I can always just ignore it or skip it, you know?

Same with Gates constantly reusing the Theme of Hope and Desperation.

And Super with the Partner Theme, [spoilers](#s ""Dark Matter"") Theme, and Tree of Life theme.

Every motif these games had were reasonably placed, but these remixes, it usually feels out of place. 

There's nothing wrong with mashing up one track from one game with a different track from another, but if you know the context behind both tracks and they don't match up... It just feels awkward.

I always thought pushing felt awkward and iffy at first, too, but I gradually got used to it, so much so in Super's post-game that I would always instinctively press B whenever I would trade places with my teammates in the older games. Pushing's definitely helped me in a few spots, like with pushing everyone back during Monster Houses, or pushing another Pokémon toward a tougher enemy I know I can't beat.

The 3D models are a hit-or-miss thing, but I personally liked them. They're not *as* expressive as the 2D sprites, but I could see the developers tried to compensate for that as best they could with the models emoting to match their character portraits. Plus, some of the 3D cutscenes look pretty neat, too. They do a decent job of trying to replicate the aesthetic the older games had, imo. It doesn't feel *exactly* the same, but close enough to the point I don't feel alienated.

Usually when I find an Awakening emera, it's when I have a party of three Pokémon that don't even have Mega Evolutions to begin with, so I rarely even get to use them for their intended purpose.

It even had its own movie, own in-game events in B/W/B2/W2, and had a ton of its own merchandise. Almost feel bad for it, to still be overshadowed by the Pokémon it was trying to equivocate. 

Though outside of that, I'd say Joltik, but it's only four inches tall... Not that PMD sprites and models are ever up-to-scale or anything, but still. It's just so cute!

It'd definitely add to the diversity to have another Ground-type on the starter roster (right up there with Phanpy, who I'd like to see return, too), and I'd love to see Trapinch's and its evolution line's reaction portraits in-game.

310,"I usually like to see the partner in every game as a male (almost all PMD games tend to avoid pronouns altogether anyway), but Super was an exception. 

While I continued to view the partner as a male (or, at least, a somewhat effeminate male) during my blind playthrough of the game when it was first released, seeing posts on this sub saying that some international versions of the game (I think it was German, especially) always refer to the partner as a female ('partnerin', I think?) no matter what, as well as seeing TheGoldCrow's fandub of the game (which has the most adorable voice for his partner) made me think otherwise.

There's even a point during the school arc of the game where the partner laughs pretty effeminately, too. And seeing them lag behind and freak out when you walk together with them during the Ghost arc was pretty adorable.

The Explorers partner was even more of a wimp and a coward all throughout the game (except whenever you were there; then he'd magically get brave and do all sorts of daredevil stunts like jumping into quicksand and waterfalls and letting Diglett see his feet), but I like to view him as a male/

Also, about Espurr and Deerling's thing about having ""girl time"" together, I think that was also more said in jest in response to you and your partner's possible surprise at seeing them hang out for the first time.

I even bought the Rescue Team guidebook since I liked the pretty artwork and was a sucker for learning ""secrets and mysteries"" within the game. It was also before I really used the Internet that much to look things up.

If I remember right, the event is almost completely random, and can only happen within the post-game? I remember being a Venusaur when it happened for me all those years back.

It was around the time 4th gen hype and foreshadowing was at an all time high, with me being obsessed with the movie Lucario and the Mystery of Mew and me having just obtained the Weavile, Bonsly, and Mime Jr. statues. Wasn't Lucario Rank yet, though!

It surprised the hell out of me when I saw Munchlax in the Square, needing an Apple. I kept trying different things to see if he could return or if I could recruit him, but to no avail. Never really used the Munch Belt, either. Oh well. Was still cool regardless.

339,"Gengar's my favorite PMD villain, and you've given the best analysis on him I've ever read!

I really like his mission in Super. His cameo is so subtly done--hell, his laugh isn't even the same anymore, probably due to a translation error or two--but you just know it's him because he's doing the one thing he does best (being ""mean""), but now he's applying it in a way that actually benefits other Pokémon. Just talking to him in Baram Town seems to show that he's more content with his life now, even if he's still stuck as a Pokémon and has no chance to return to his own world.

When you start his Connection Orb mission, he just tells you that he wrote a letter ""full of nasty choice words and insults"" that he's asking you to send to a Banette in Capim Town. Normally, most players would assume this could only lead to something either hurtful or comically insulting, but instead, there's a twist in that you find out Banette actually loved the letter, and that she actually needs negative emotions like those to survive.

It not only shows how much Gengar has changed, but it also shows that the guy's finally found his calling in life, getting to be himself around other Pokémon who accept him for who he is. Even past all the fear and despair he felt after causing Gardevoir's death, and after all the convincing he had put himself through into thinking he was a heartless monster, he's still inherently just a mischievous jerkwad through and through. He had just never meant any real harm with it at first. And now he's back to his old self again.

Not to mention that he's still connected to Gardevoir, Ekans, and Medicham--so while he may have moved on from Team Meanies, he's at least still acquaintances with those three, and he's made some new friends of his own, as well.

His mission also helps support the main message Super tries to convey at the halfway point and ending of the game--that not everyone can constantly stay positive, no matter how hard they try. Negative emotions play a part in keeping this world as varied and diverse as it is, and as long as they don't get out of hand or hurtful, we should accept some of our negative emotions for what they are. Allow ourselves to feel angry, or sad, or depressed--the world isn't perfect, and it's never going to be. Everyone should have the freedom to express themselves and vent in different ways (within reason, of course). [](#H5)",2016-06-28 00:56:36+00:00,d4qms4r,2.0,t1_d4q9zqj,18148.0,MysteryDungeon

342,"Once you've reached the post-game, Tiny Reviver Seeds kind of become obsolete. You can try to farm them and continue to use them if you like, but Cofagrigus has the option for you to buy five Reviver Seeds for just one Gold Bar. Ranking up gives you plenty of Gold Bars, and just finding sparkling patches in dungeons alone most likely gets you a decent number of bars already.

If you have a plethora of Plain Seeds from any of the times you fainted, you can also take a Pokémon who knows the move Recycle (Munchlax, Snorlax, Trubbish, Garbodor, the Pan-monkeys, the Simi-monkeys, etc.) into a dungeon and have them spam the move until all of your Plain Seeds are restored. Plain Seeds restored using Recycle have the possibility to be turned back into Reviver Seeds, Tiny Reviver Seeds, Oran Berries, and literally *any* other seed introduced in the PMD series at random (including Violent Seeds and the like).

Though if you're looking for Tiny Reviver Seeds specifically, you can go to Pelipper Island and grind for items in the early-game dungeons (or any dungeon you want, really, except for ones that are designed to have items that screw you over, like ones with Grimy Food); for me, going to places like Open Pass and Lush Forest alone got me a decent amount of items already. Tiny Reviver Seeds are still a rarity, but every time you finish a dungeon, the Kecleon Shop at Pelipper Island resets, so you can always check if he's selling them there without having to go through the good-night and good-morning cutscenes and having to sail on Lapras to check every available Kek Shop ever.

343,"THANK YOU. You don't know how happy I am that someone else feels the *exact* way I do about Super's recruitment system! I've made similar comments about how the old RNG system can feel a bit grind-y and troll-y, especially when it came to making you repeat the same (occasionally 99-floor) dungeons over and over again if you were unlucky. As well as how taxing it must be for the developers to program in pretty much *every* current Pokémon in each installment, only for players to either *only* use their hero and partner and little else (like I did; I only recruited legendaries just for the achievement of it and to see how cool they looked in their Friend Area/Pokémon Square/Spinda's Café). 

Anyone else I recruited was either gotten not of my own accord, and of random chance, only added to my team for the sake of completing the ""PokéDex"". I never made an honest effort to level grind new recruits to evolve them, go to specific dungeons for a specific non-legendary Pokémon, purposely gather any evolution items (only getting ones I found by random happenstance on a mission or fun exploration if I had the money/means of stealing them from shops), etc. Only time I ever really did any of that was in Rescue Team when I tried to recreate Team Meanies to play as when I was a lot younger.

In Super, this was the first time I was motivated to recruit 'em all, and it's a fun thing to do when on long flights, when you have some down time and don't want to do anything too exerting, etc. etc. It was great. And not only did I love the improved team-wide EXP Share, which kept every team member on par with you, the Motivated feature was great, too, which pushed you to use Pokémon you don't normally use. I also didn't mind the Break feature too much, either. It helped balance the game ""enough"" early on and it forced me to go out of my comfort zone by playing with someone new if I kept calling on the same Pokémon I liked over and over. 

The older games still have their charm, of course, and other mechanics I still like in their own light (and a few I still even prefer over some of what Super had), but I loved how Super polished the gameplay overall, especially in the recruitment aspect. Maybe the next game can balance the old and new recruitment systems somehow for people who still prefer the old one a lot more?

Anyway, about the story! It's not a scene that a lot of people talked about, but I found it kind of funny how Xerneas was finally revealed in the flesh *only* to be made into a third wheel watching you, your partner, Espurr, Celebi, Jirachi, and Ampharos talk amongst themselves for like five minutes, and then leave without a word to him. Felt a bit bad that Xerneas got the shaft like that, especially right after he was rescued. His role and relationship with the partner (both Mew-partner and starter-partner) definitely should've been expanded upon. Otherwise, it would have made his appearance at the tree overlooking Serene Village more impactful.

I do agree that the post-game could have been expanded upon as well. I feel Spike Chunsoft chose not to use Zygarde in the story, though, because they may have been told by Game Freak that Zygarde would be getting some newer forms that story expansion that might change the current story and gameplay PSMD wanted to show. Same reason why Volcanion wasn't added in. The game came out too early to make Zygarde relevant with what little we knew of him at the time, unfortunately.

Rescue Team came out at the very end of 3rd gen so it even got to use 4th gen cameos like Munchlax and Lucario. And Gates came out at the very end of 5th gen so it got to use the new B2W2 forms of the main legendaries in its post-game (even if they did *nothing* in the story).

Super is in an awkward position because, even though it came out at the very end of 6th gen, 6th gen never got a conclusive ending or director's cut main series game (like Pokémon Z) to end with. Zygarde wasn't relevant in X/Y/OR/AS, and we didn't learn anything about him until the anime and possibly Sun/Moon (which are 7th gen games).

But that doesn't excuse Super's post-game for being too short and rushed. It's s step up from Gates's post-game length-wise, but it definitely could have written Mew and her relationship with the protagonist better so I could actually *feel* something when her life was at stake in the Purifying Cave.

I was lulled into think this game's post-game might actually be as long as Explorers, what with me being told to going into different Continents and going on several mission with Mew, when suddenly BAM KNOCKED OUT SENT TO SERENE VILLAGE WITH SHORT TEMPORARY QUICKLY-RESOLVED MEMORY LOSS FOR QUICK EXPOSITION LET'S WRAP THIS UP PEOPLE WE DIDN'T WANT TO REPEAT THE MANAPHY ARC SO WE JUST JUMP CUT SEVERAL DAYS OF STORY AND PROGRESSION FOR YOU",2016-06-27 05:12:03+00:00,d4pi46d,1.0,t3_4q0tve,13233.0,MysteryDungeon

Thanks for enlightening me on how difficult breaking the illusion of choice can be. I agree that it's doubtful PMD of all things may break that mold, so I'd just consider it a pipe dream of mine.

348,"Hmm... While a lot of people here seem to have already hit pretty much every point I would have liked in a more mature PMD game, I'm going to suggest something small.

I'd love to have a PMD game where your choices actual matter--maybe not all of them should change the plot, but I feel the dialogue should at least be a lot more varied between what text you choose to respond with.

Having to choose between things like ""Oh no! I'm scared!"" and ""Gah! I'm afraid!"" aren't choices. They're just synonyms of the same phrase. Sometimes the games have interesting and funny dialogue options, like some that make the protagonist look like a jerk and some that try to be joke-y about a situation, but the majority just seem pointless and lazily done. Like, there's even a *serious* moment in the Explorers games that makes you choose between ""......."" and ""......."". It's ridiculous.

Chimecho even makes fun on this in Explorers of Sky ~~which is why she's the best guild member--~~

The only real choice we had in the entire series was whether we [Gates to Infinity spoilers](#s ""could decide if we wanted to return to the Pokemon world or not when the partner called upon the protagonist in the Worldcore, but even then, while choosing 'No' TECHNICALLY gives you a bad ending, it only results in a Game Over, Paper Mario style, so it's still not even a legitimate choice, because you're still forced to go back there and make the protagonist come back anyways."")

I'm hoping for a PMD game that can maybe branch into multiple endings or slightly different paths depending on some of the choices you make.

PMD is already incredibly story-driven as it is; why not take it to the next level and break the monotony of just doing dungeon after dungeon by giving you more of an incentive to pay attention to the game's dialogue and its characters?

Maybe constantly being a jerk to your partner might start off with him passing it off as a joke, only for it to hit them harder and harder until they begins to question their friendship with you, and you'll end the game as mild acquaintances at best.

And sticking by their side in the most positive way possible, and being there for them when they needed you most might end in you becoming best friends; maybe they might even develop feelings for you.

And being indifferent or having a mix of both extremes will end in a normal, platonic friendship.

Maybe your relationships with other characters could have potential to be jeopardized by these dialogue choices as well; maybe you could influence the game so that the protagonist feels nothing but contempt and anger toward the mysterious circumstances that turn him into a Pokémon, to the point he refuses to make friends with anyone at all because of how much he wants to go home and misses his *real* friends and family in the human world; a feeling that can either be worsened or healed depending on how the story goes. He may end up shoving them away because none of the Pokémon here can help, none of them can empathize, and none of them can understand what being a human is like.

The protagonist may even have trouble adjusting to living in the Pokémon world, and may not have as much of an understanding on what Pokémon are compared to all the other PMD protagonists.

The main antagonist might even prey on the protagonist's vulnerable state to get him to want to help him in his goals; the villain might trick the protagonist by making up a false reason as to how he got his amnesia and why he was sent to this world, and might end up convincing the *protagonist* to betray all the good Pokémon that have come into his life so far, including his partner.

Having the ability to alter and change the climax of the game's story would be amazing if it was written in a way that was compelling enough, and would add to the replayability of it for the sake of getting the other endings.",2016-06-26 05:15:31+00:00,d4oc4mx,1.0,t3_4ptc2k,44106.0,MysteryDungeon

350,"Definitely agree with you there. I personally don't think it's necessary to always add every single Pokémon ever in every PMD game (because really, even with the Motivated and Break feature, who's *really* going to use Pokémon like Azurill and Tranquill at all), but the least the developers could do is place them all in fitting areas.

I gives Super some slack when it comes to placing Pokémon in the irrelevant dungeons, though; places like Small Sand Dune and Stone Field are places you would probably never visit outside of one or two times because of a mission. And the game has so many irrelevant non-story dungeons that I can't really blame them for not trying with a few. Some of these extra dungeons just feel like mission fodder.

Some of the irrelevant dungeons were cool and interesting, though, and some of them felt like they had potential for story. Like this one dungeon called Ghost Island or something that was filled with nothing but Ghost-types and other Pokémon that fit the place in this dense haunted jungle off the coast of the Air Continent. And they would all savagely kill every Shedinja in it to evolve and fight you. Ghost Island literally looks like a transparent island on the map, which makes it stand out from a lot of the other dungeons in this game ever because the maps in Super are nowhere near as detailed as they were in Rescue Team and Explorers. The only other dungeon I could think of that's also drawn accurately on the map is Heart Lake.

Pumpkaboo Forest is another dungeon which has a shit ton of Pumpkaboo and creative, varied types of Pokémon that always have a chance of screwing you over no matter who you bring.

Stealth Cave was really cool, too--you're forced to escort Shedinja through it your first time through for a mission, and he blends right into the color palette of the dungeon, making him hard to see and keep watch over sometimes. It's a nice small detail since the place's Japanese name is ""Ninja Cave"". I like the idea of Pokémon having specific, one-off places they live in or like to visit. The enemy Pokémon placement here is god-awful, though. Froakie makes sense, but everyone else? They could've added Pokémon like Sandshrew, Sandslash, Baltoy, and Claydol who also might blend in or complement with the dungeon's colors, or other ""ninja""-related Pokémon like Accelgor and Ninjask. So I see your point there in that Pokémon placement *does* matter if other aspects of the dungeon are cool enough.

Most of Super's story dungeons had fitting-enough Pokémon from what I remember, though. The only story dungeons that had me scratching my head was the Prehistoric Ruins.

But even then I give Prehistoric Ruins some slack because it's an ancient city, and the fact than it's dominated by mostly Fighting-types instead of the obvious ""ancient"" Pokémon they usually use for places like these adds to its mystery and makes it unique.

The early-game dungeons, [PSMD spoilers](#s ""the Voidlands dungeons,"") and the final three dungeons, all of which are the most important, all had fitting-enough Pokémon in them to keep me immersed.",2016-06-25 07:02:01+00:00,d4nad07,2.0,t1_d4n8194,6467.0,MysteryDungeon
351,"Oooh, nice! PMD is one of the most ideal games to play on long flights for me because it doesn't take very much out of you. I have fond memories grinding up to try to recreate Team Meanies to play as in Rescue Team during flights as a kid, and even spent some time doing PSMD's post-story post-game during a flight a few months ago.

Anyway, I digress. From my few months here on this sub, I've gathered that anyone who has asked to compare Super to all the other PMD games will always get different answers.

There never seems to be a clear consensus on whether it's a really good, bad, or average game. Most people just say it's more or less on par with Explorers of Sky, and above Rescue Team and Gates.

But ever since PSMD was first announced, I've found everyone seemed to have different expectations and expected thousands of different things from it across the many fans who prayed this game wouldn't be as bad as Gates (gameplay-wise, not story-wise).

For what Super was, I loved it. The story was interesting and flipped a lot of commonly-used PMD tropes on its head, the gameplay is the most polished to date, and the cameos and world-building were a nice touch. 

Like thekoreansun mentioned, though, the pacing is a bit awkward, and some aspects of the game could have still been executed better than they were, but otherwise, I would say it's a solid installment for the series.",2016-06-25 06:43:24+00:00,d4na048,1.0,t3_4pqtnq,11167.0,MysteryDungeon
352,"I had my problems with Sinister Woods, too, mainly from losing to Team Meanies once or twice, but Mt. Thunder was the first dungeon that kept me stuck on Rescue Team for *ages* when I was a kid, and quickly gave me the shocking realization that the rest of the game was most likely going to be this hard--maybe even harder--and that I had to git gud.

Mt. Thunder wasn't *that* hard a dungeon from what I can recall, but I do have **fond** Zapdos *constantly* kicked my ass. And I mean *constantly*. It surprised and scared the shit out of me when I realized we had to *actually* fight him, and made every attempt at beating him from then on an adrenaline rush because, after the first several losses, I started to think it was impossible (because he was a legendary and the game went from 0-to-100 *real* quick with its bosses). 

Of course, I was only like 8 or 9 at the time, and only knew the basics of the mechanics of the game. Didn't really know how to use items that well, nor did I ever link moves, and I avoided status moves and stat-reducing moves like the plague because that was how I played the main series games. Only playing with all-offensive moves.

Hell, I didn't even know how Reviver Seeds worked until Mt. Blaze when I was struggling with Moltres, and any use I had from them in any dungeons prior were completely unintentional and confused the shit out of me. Like, why was the game suddenly reviving me and my team members? Was it showing pity on me?

Little did my dumb ass know those Reviver Seeds I may have picked up on the umpteenth climb up Mt. Thunder Peak, not sure how many times I resetted and how many times I just decided to redo the entire dungeon again for the EXP (not that the extra EXP helped *that* much). Somehow, and I don't know how, but I managed to beat Zapdos, and it felt like the most accomplished thing I had done at the time when it came to shit I got through in video games.

I was a Bulbasaur with a Pikachu partner. Pretty sure I might have just gotten lucky with paralysis eventually, then proceeded to brute force him until he fainted.

I don't remember minding any of the later dungeons in the game at all, though. Sure, I remember dying a lot in dungeons like Mt. Blaze and Frosty Forest, but I don't remember being stuck on them for *as* long, or even getting as tense or as salty toward them.

I also remember spending the entire summer of 2006 playing through the post-game and grinding to Lv100 while trying to reach top rank and get all the statues. I'm proud of 9-year-old me for being willing to that. Nowadays I couldn't care less about trying to 100% a PMD game, mostly because I now know the rewards you get after Rescue Team aren't really worth it to me.

... Guess I rambled for a bit there... Sorry. Rescue Team was just the most immersive PMD/Pokémon gave ever for me lmao, even more so than Explorers. I don't think I was ever so *into* and *invested* in a game before.

**TL;DR:** I was a dumbass kid and struggled with Zapdos at Mt. Thunder and won probably by sheer luck after weeks of attempts",2016-06-25 06:27:59+00:00,d4n9p9w,1.0,t3_4pqsov,10681.0,MysteryDungeon
353,"I'm just hoping the series doesn't get too formulaic. PMD's done well enough four handheld installments in (not counting the WiiWare games), and each game has had its own share of unique stories, crazy settings, twists on tropes, memorable characters, and story surprises here and there, but...

I hope the writers at Spike Chunsoft don't feel they have to constantly change around the same tropes over and over in different ways. Super Mystery Dungeon did a great job at using a lot of the tropes we were used to from the past games and using them in ways many of us didn't expect--like the way you met and became friends with your partner, what Pokémon you met when you started the game *instead* of your partner, how the betrayal(s) were handled, who the main antagonist really is...

But story elements that are entirely new would definitely feel refreshing as well. 

In PMD games nowadays, a lot of us expect the same thing. An amnesiac human turned into a Pokémon; a partner who sticks by your side and loves adventuring; some sort of betrayal from at least one Pokémon that either tried to gain your trust, feigned innocence, or was tricked into switching sides; some sort of cataclysmic event that could potentially destroy the world; at least one of the current-gen legendary Pokémon being involved somehow; etc. etc.

And while all of that is nice, and is a great formula to work with and twist around in many different ways, I hope it's not used so often that people will start to rag on PMD for being ""as formulaic and repetitive as the main series games"". 

People often come to PMD for the story, because it gets enough complaints for the gameplay being repetitive as it is, so I just hope the stories it brings to the table stay as exciting and immersive as ever.

The stakes in every PMD game have only gotten bigger and bigger, with Super Mystery Dungeon having the most climactic and dramatic final battle out of all of them. With how all-out PSMD went with displaying its story's climax, I wonder if it's even possible for the next PMD game to top it.

If it does top it somehow, great, but I personally don't think a game like PMD necessarily *has* to have this over-the-top, protect-the-universe level conflict at the end of *every* single one of its stories. The game can focus on other aspects of the world, or smaller-scale problems that can still leave a heavy impact on the world's inhabitants, for example. Maybe they can even focus more on character depth, development, interactions, and lore rather than some new threat ready to try to blow everything up again.

I remember reading an interview saying some at Spike Chunsoft admitting that even they weren't sure where to take the PMD series from where PSMD left off. If I manage to find the source again, I'll link it in this comment. It hardly means the end of the PMD series, considering, like SeafoamGaming said, PMD is their best-selling game, but I'd be fine with PSMD being the finale as well. 

Which is why I personally think the next game is just as good an opportunity as any to try something at least *somewhat* new, either story-wise or gameplay-wise. And hopefully people who are adverse to change will at least give it a chance.",2016-06-24 22:00:10+00:00,d4mthty,1.0,t3_4pomx6,10244.0,MysteryDungeon
354,"My personal favorites were Diglett and Dugtrio, in both Rescue Team and Explorers! Both games handled their father-son dynamic differently, opening up plenty of room for joke material between the two of them. 

I liked Diglett's wide-eyed innocence and enthusiasm at his father's ""hobby"" in watching the sea in the first game, buying into his bluffs of his ""daring adventures"" when he was away. In Explorers, however, Diglett seems to have matured some, and realizes that his dad's obsession with the ocean tends to get him to slack off from his job at the guild. 

Seeing Diglett get Loudred to hide behind some bushes and pretend to be the sea to yell at him to get back to work at one point was hilarious. It's interactions and chemistry like that that made me love the guild, even if they weren't the most relevant or useful characters in the game. 

I also love how Dugtrio actually ends up trying to swim by the very end of the game as well, exaggerating the story as if he had braved some vicious storm...only to find out the legendary Team Raider helped pull him out of some shallow water by the beach.

Team Raider had been hyped up to be arguably the strongest Exploration Team out there (not counting the player's team, of course), causing even Wigglytuff to admire their strength...and the only thing they do in this game is *that*.

358,"They're only called ""Red and Blue"" Rescue Team because they're the very *first* PMD games. Pokémon Red and Blue were the very first main series games (outside of Japan that is), so Chunsoft took cues from that and decided to name their first spin-off game similarly to the main series to attract more attention from fans who were familiar with both the series and the naming scheme of the games.

""Oh! Pokémon Red and Blue? I remember those! But what's this Mystery Dungeon business all about...? Might as well give it a shot.""

That mentality obviously didn't apply to *every* consumer back in 2006, but the extra nod to the main series would definitely be necessary for attracting people who weren't accepting of things that were new and different from what they were used to. It would at least get them to pay a little more attention to the boxart at least.

359,"Oooh, I definitely agree with you there! I would definitely make Super's partner either a close second in my book.

I appreciated all the trope changes Super added in its first half of the story--not meeting your partner within the first 10 seconds of the game when you wake up in this world, having your friendship with your partner actually grow and develop *gradually* rather than instantaneously, having conflicts in your friendship along the way...

And unlike some people, I didn't mind the spotlight being ""taken away"" from me when the partner became more of a primary focus to the plot. Gates to Infinity's partner was the first partner in the series to have any semblance of the backstory, but like Munna, his was vague and merely brushed upon when it had potential for massive and well-written and well-needed elaboration.

Super's partner's backstory may have ended up a bit convoluted and shoved in near the end, but the fact that it was there in the first place gives it an extra plus for me. 

The humor in Super in *general* has much better execution than any other game in the series. The comedic timing with the first five bosses, interactions with Ampharos, the antics of the partner and the school kids... And while there definitely *were* funny moments in the other games, the graphical limitations, sprites, and overall translation/writing style at the time prevented some of the scenes they were going for to reach their full intended effect.

Super's partner's personality is a hit-or-miss thing with a lot of people; many hated her backstory, her personality, and found her to be a ""glory hog"" when she ""became the main character"". I disagree. I personally thought it was a breath of fresh air, especially considering the hero had been the main focus in every installment prior.

Though what held her back for me was how hasty she was. Sure, she was funny every now and then, and I liked how self-dependent she was and how unique her personality was compared to the other partners, too, but I wasn't too keen on being constantly being forced into things without properly asking.

Sure, her having trouble asking other kids to get involved with things with her was often played for laughs, like when she demanded--then asked--to be the hero's friend, but then it progressed into making the hero become an Jr. Expedition Society member, then leaving the village, then joining the real Expedition Society...

It's a small thing, but it kinda bugged me. I found it cute the first couple times, but the others... I only mildly agreed with and just went along with in the end. I'm just not that into being forced into big decisions that the player and main character are likely to be unsure about. It just felt more apparent than it did in Explorers.

With leaving Serene Village, that was just a fortunate coincidence for the hero and partner that the Beheeyem were starting to lurk right outside it, giving you another excuse to leave if you weren't sure by then, but... Why were they there? Plot convenience? The Beheeyem had literally no reason to be there out in the open as far as I can think of.

360,"The partner in Explorers was definitely my favorite! Though it's mostly because I had a personal attachment to him as a kid when I played Explorers of Darkness for the first time. I related to a lot of what he was going through and what his personality was like; I was extremely shy and felt like I needed my only friend to help me cope with social situations as well. Said friend moved schools after the 5th grade, making it difficult to keep in touch anywhere near as often as we used to and leaving me to try to socialize with others myself without fear. The ending with the Explorers partner losing his only friend as well definitely made the ending feel more personal for me at the time. As if *I* was the partner and *he* was the hero.

The way the partner handled all five stages of grief when he was sent to the future and realize the true nature of the situation with Dusknoir and Grovyle was pretty well-written as well. If there was ever a point I would track in which the partner developed quite a bit, it would be here. His reactions and struggles here felt realistic and believable when you consider his rather naïve and innocent personality.

I also loved the way he tried to fake an overly-positive attitude after ""Cresselia"" tried to convince him that his and the hero's life were a burden in his dreams, and that they needed to die to keep everyone happy and safe. The way he handled that realization, by trying to stay as positive as he possibly can to hide his insecurities and existential crisis so the hero wouldn't worry, felt reminiscent to the words and actions *actual* people going through thoughts of suicide and depression.

Waking up in the middle of the night to see your partner not in his bed almost made me think he had given in and attempted to actually kill himself, like ""Cresselia"" suggested in Azurill's dream just hours ago. And then the talk he had with the hero about Grovyle, and his ""death"" as the sun began to rise... It was beautiful.

Wigglytuff's reassurance that all life is precious, and that no one's life deserves to end early also brought a tear to my eye, and I was glad to see the partner react a similar way. 

Though, considering how Pokémon Square's inhabitants handled this sort of topic, they may not agree with Wigglytuff's philosophy when it comes to ""Pokémon whose existence might end the world""...

363,"&gt; It takes a very long time to get anyone outside of 'you' and the partner anywhere near end-game dungeon levels, and on top of that, IQ grinding is even worse.

I agree with you when it comes to grinding up levels for recruits other than your hero and partner, but I disagree with you on IQ.

IQ is a completely optional part of the game that can potentially make the entire game--even some of its most difficult dungeons--an absolute cakewalk. Grinding max IQ is just a fun side-aspect of the game that players can do if they like, but it was never something stressed by the game's dialogue or tutorials that you should force yourself to get involved with if it wasn't your thing.

During my first playthrough of Sky, back when I was still too young to bother looking that deep into the more optional mechanics of the game, I never used Spinda's Café outside of one or two drinks early on out of curiosity when it was first introduced, and rarely used the Recycle Shop unless I had a lot of Plain Seeds to get rid of.

Just eating every Gummi I happened to find in a dungeon as I progressed through the story--while saving two Blue Gummis in storage for the post-game, of course--gave enough IQ skills for my hero and partner to get by. Sure, my partner may or may not have learned anything *too* spectacular, but I liked being left in the dark and constantly surprised by what cool new ability I'd get if I kept eating these free boosters on the ground.

I *never* consciously went looking for Gummis. My partner was too stupid to avoid traps? I just adjusted my play style to carefully maneuver myself in a way that tries to get them *not* to step on them. Sure, it's still a hassle, but it's not the *hardest* problem to avoid.

The enhanced default teammate AI Super is an absolute godsend, though. It was definitely a much-needed addition.

I still like IQ, and the satisfaction of *earning* a new ability instead of *miraculously* finding one in a Box in the form of a Team Skill in Gates, which felt dirty and undeserved to me. 

Super's emera system is still interesting, though, because it doesn't permanently make the game easy. In the DS games, maxing out or near-maxing out your IQ made the rest of the game a breeze. In Super, you always start off every dungeon as a blank slate, and the game pushes you to think about what Looplets you should bring and how many Emera-Up Orbs you might need to get by. Depending on your luck (and if you haven't roided yourselves up on *too* many Vitamins), the dungeon you're currently in could be a nightmare, a decent challenge, or an absolute cakewalk, unlike in the DS games where you'd *always* be given a cakewalk once your IQ was maxed out.

367,"Now that you mention it, the partner *does* seem to go through the five stages of grief when Dusknoir betrays him. 

**Denial** that it actually happened, thinking that Dusknoir is still a good guy, Grovyle is still evil, and that this whole ""bad future"" excursion was a bad dream/a huge misunderstanding.

**Anger** at Grovyle for crimes he committed for the greater good that the partner believed were bad, and anger at himself for not knowing who to trust anymore. He also blew a fuse when Grovyle was talking about how bad Dusknoir really was.

**Bargaining** when he tries to weigh whether allying himself with Grovyle is the right thing, or whether he should just try to surrender himself to Dusknoir to find answers and see who's really telling the truth.

**Depression** when he has that chat with you atop Dark Hill, when he starts to lose hope that he may never go back to his own time, and that he and his friend will be trapped in the future forever.

And **acceptance**, when the hero talks him out of all of this and when he agrees with the hero that finding Grovyle and teaming up with him is the best course of action they can take, even if he still doesn't completely trust him yet.

That doesn't happen with Super, but I guess that's because the betrayer in that game did a better job of making their intentions clear.

... And no one in Treasure Town bats an eye. Sure, they were worried that you two were suddenly gone, but *apparently* their eyes and ears didn't seem to be working properly at the time. Chatot even thinks you two *SLIPPED IN BY ACCIDENT*. Dusknoir didn't even pull them in that fast!

368,"I like him because I was just like the partner myself, back when I was a kid. Shyness mixed with wide-eyed enthusiasm are common traits for many children, and children are who the PMD games aim to reach out to. The Explorers partner was my favorite because he helped motivate me to try to overcome my own shyness and cowardice when it came to speaking with others; that scene where he chickened out of trying to enter the Guild when Loudred and Diglett identified him hit *really* close to home with me back then, as well as the ending.

I don't think all the partners are *exactly* the same, though; while they're all super idealistic, the Rescue Team partner was motivated, the Explorers partner was timid, the Gates partner actually had a past and used to be bitter and depressed like everyone else, and the Super partner was rambunctious, headstrong, and mischievous. 

And Rescue Team's and Gates's hero actually had dialogue and *talked* with your partner out loud a lot of the time, making actual chemistry between them, while Explorers' and Super's hero would keep to themselves and *mostly* talk in their own mind.

But Explorers gets the upper hand over Super here because Explorers took advantage of the hero's silence all throughout the game to [spoilers](#s ""surprise us when he suddenly starts talking out loud to the partner for the very first time when he's about to disappear."") 

In Super, the hero [spoilers](#s ""always talks in parentheses. No matter what. Even during the ending when the partner disappears."") But they try to compensate by making it ambiguous as to whether the hero is actually talking or not, letting the player decide whether he's speaking out loud or still speaking in his head at some points.

At one point in Super, [spoilers](#s ""when you first enter the Voidlands""),  the hero says the partner's name in parentheses while facing her, and the partner responds as if she had actually heard him. There are a few other moments in the game that are similar. Like that scene when [spoilers](#s ""the hero talks with Espurr and the partner on the hill overlooking Lively Town in the ending. The hero talks with parentheses the entire time, but at times the partner and Espurr will respond to him as if he was talking out loud, and other times they'll wonder why he strangely goes silent while he's monologuing in his head. The difference between whether he's thinking to himself and whether he's talking out loud is whether he's facing them or not. He turns away whenever he's thinking, and looks at the Pokémon he's talking to when he's talking out loud."") 

I remember a person or two on here (I think it was myName I had this conversation with a while back) saying the Super protagonist has *no* dialogue toward anyone but himself in the entire game, when that isn't true in the slightest.",2016-06-23 21:33:57+00:00,d4ldbql,5.0,t1_d4lc8wq,1471.0,MysteryDungeon
369,"Some people didn't like how overly-reliant and needy the partner was toward you, and how he seemed to constantly use you as a crutch to do every little thing. While it's nice that he admits his cowardice and awkward shyness every now and then, he sometimes takes it to extremes regardless, and his character growth is hard to gauge because the majority of the time he just seems to be talking to himself in cutscenes (since you're a silent protagonist and all), and only does the things he does because he has a brick wall to project his fears and inhibitions onto.

Some people didn't like being treated as the partner's personal venting machine, especially when the player character gives little to no vocal encouragement back to him whatsoever other than nods of agreement, posing, or waddling in place whenever the player wants to explain something. 

It also didn't help that a lot of the partner's dialogue was awkwardly translated at times; he would *constantly* say your name multiple times every other sentence, when he didn't really need to. His dialogue was also very repetitive, and he had a habit of repeating everything you said, near-verbatim, even though you had already said everything important in your head before telling him.

But that isn't what I personally think of him. I loved Explorers' partner; when I was a kid playing Darkness for the first time, I related to him more than every other character. His ridiculous shyness, his reliance toward his best (and only) friend to do even the most simplest of tasks, [spoilers](#s ""losing that friend and learning to manage on his own, even if he didn't think he could..."") I empathized with him a lot when I was 10-11, experiencing and living through a lot of these things myself; back when I was part of the game's target audience. 

Obviously I didn't notice the partner's flaws back then. Nowadays I see the Explorers partner's flaws *much* more clearly, but I still hold a fond, personal attachment to him despite that. Even moreso than the hero, who's *supposed* to be you. But I guess the hero was kept silent and of bland personality so the player could project and interpret his/her personality however they liked.",2016-06-23 20:54:27+00:00,d4lbkim,3.0,t1_d4l8p4l,3609.0,MysteryDungeon

374,"Don't get me wrong, I agree with a lot of your points as well (finding the mechanics clunky, partner AI not being that bothersome at all, expecting bosses to be tough, etc.).

When I mentioned the learning curve near the end of the game, I was just surprised at how long Magma Cavern was compared to every other dungeon in the game beforehand. Mt. Freeze was 20 floors total with a halfway point in between; Magma Cavern was 26 floors total, but the rest point was what, 24 floors in? It surprised me how long it was playing through it blind as a kid, but since the story hyped it up to be this immensely deep dungeon no one but Team ACT could get through. I felt SUPER relieved to finally find a point to rest after such a long trek down, only to be surprised once more that the next stage of the dungeon was only like two floors.

Sky Tower was also justifiably long because it's the final dungeon. 

But the learning curve gets much, MUCH steeper by the post-game, where they introduce Traps, HM requirements, dungeon restrictions, Keys/locked doors, evolution, new Friend Areas costing thousands more Poke, a free-roam story to do things in almost any order you want, and several new dungeons to explore (some that were even *99 floors* with NO warning that they were going to be *that* long) with little direction on where to go and what to do *all at once*. As a kid I didn't mind all of that, either--in fact, I enjoyed continuously being surprised by new things even after the final boss, but with how much they throw at you *right after* you beat the main story, it's objectively steep--so steep that the later PMD games decided to introduce all their mechanics at a much more gradual pace. 

In Explorers, Traps were introduced in Amp Plains, halfway through the main story, and in Gates and Super, Traps were introduced much earlier on, and locked doors/keys were integrated into very early dungeons as well.

Though that doesn't change how many times I died during the story. I'll definitely keep recruiting an Electrike in mind next time I play through Rescue Team--especially since Amp Plains' boss had a similar strategy people liked to use.

Also, you could still switch your teammates' moves on and off in Super. Not sure if you could in Gates, though; it's been a while.",2016-06-23 02:12:40+00:00,d4k9r6h,4.0,t1_d4k4g9x,8210.0,MysteryDungeon

376,"Glad to see you're willing to try another PMD game out! Just be warned that Rescue Team is the arguably the hardest and most clunkily-controlled PMD game; a lot of people cut it some slack because it was the *first* PMD game and the developers had nothing to go on at the time. It didn't help that the GBA and early DS don't have the best sound chips in the world, but at the time they were the best quality sounds we had for a Nintendo handheld. And as children, it's not like we really cared about things like that in particular--all most of us cared about back then was that it was Pokémon and it was a completely new experience away from the main series, so it was hard to see any flaws in the game at the age many of us first started playing Rescue Team because we were all so invested in it. 

Just make sure you stay determined and keep trying no matter how many times you faint! Having a Grass-type hero or partner instantly makes the game 10x harder because *every* story boss will be super-effective against it or will have a long dungeon *filled* with Pokémon super-effective against it.

The partner AI is at its worst, so constantly be on your guard! Set and un-set your partner's moves if they end up bothering you, so you control what they use to attack! Occasionally they'll just end up using their ""A"" attack at the worst possible time or use a move that isn't the best in a certain situation. Tactics meetings can play an important role, too!

The in-game mailbox gives you newspapers filled with tons of good strategies for what moves each starter could have and could link together. Linking moves can be important, too! They're almost like Alliance Attacks before Alliance Attacks were a thing!

Linking status moves like Smokescreen (which is super OP in this game) mixed with offensive moves are super helpful. Spamming Mud Slap until a difficult Pokémon's/a boss's accuracy is minuscule enough and hoping they don't hit you too much is another method I've seen, too!

Seeds, while not as prevalent or as varied as they were in Explorers, can help deal status effects on a boss from afar! Orbs don't work *at all* on bosses, and while Seeds are rare here, if you throw one at *any* Pokémon and it doesn't miss them, you'll be able to status them just like any other Pokémon! They won't snap out of it early like they do in Super.

Grinding for IQ with Gummis helps add useful skills for both your hero and your partner as well! It's going to be near-impossible to raise your IQ *too* high during the main story, but just eating every Gummi you find on the ground between the two of you should at least give you enough decent skills to get by!

Me, I was personally too oblivious to realize I could do a lot of this until the post-game, and ended up brute-forcing my way through everything with Bulbasaur as the player and Pikachu as my partner. Died several times. I just trying, stupidly wondering what I did wrong until I somehow managed to beat whatever boss that kept killing me. I almost raged at Mt. Thunder--was stuck on it for days because of my starter choice and how much stronger the boss was compared to me. 

I also didn't know how Reviver Seeds worked until Mt. Blaze. I remember *eating* them once I got to the boss there, hoping they would revive me, only to insta-faint once I got hit with a fire move, and stared dumbstruck at the screen wondering if my game was glitched. Learned the hard way and through trial and error how Reviver Seeds *actually* worked.

I never even linked my moves very often. I tried it once in Mt. Freeze with a Link Box on two arbitrary moves and didn't bother re-linking after they lost all PP, ever.

I don't know *how* I ended up beating the main story, let alone almost 100%ing the game when I was 9. I didn't use or even know about Wonder Mail codes, and didn't know any resources for me to find them at the time. I didn't even come out too overleveled or anything.

I know it's all a lot to take in, but the game gradually explains a lot of this for you! These are just a few tips. If you faint often, don't *always* blame yourself! Sometimes it *will* in fact be a slip-up of your own that causes you to faint or for something bad to happen, but some of the bosses in this game are super strong and know unfair moves against your favor (like Powder Snow, which hits everyone in the room from afar), but that's partially because the player has the potential to use unfair moves on them (like Smokescreen, which makes it *impossible* for the target to hit you for a few turns when the Whiffer status is in effect).

Reviver Seeds are rare, and chances are, you might be coming into some dungeons with no items at all if you don't want to reset after a loss because of the EXP you might have gained! The last two main story dungeons are also super long. Like, the learning curve there is *super* steep, but justifiably so. So keep that in mind and store as many items and as much Poké (money) as possible! Unlike in Super, saving your stuff for later is encouraged! Not often you'll really need to use your items other than for bosses, Monster Houses, or the occasional troublesome wild dungeon Pokémon.

Level grinding is also rarely necessary unless you want it to be! People beat this game's main story between levels 26-40, and rarely any of these people were consciously grinding! The vast level difference was most likely because of the kinds of missions they chose to do, how often they did them, whether they went and did every maze in the Makuhita Dojo for the reward, whether they were the type of player to linger on each floor and get every item in it and beat every Pokémon along the way before moving to the next floor, how many times they went through dungeons like the Rock Path and Snow Path, etc. etc.",2016-06-22 16:47:38+00:00,d4jkjdu,2.0,t1_d4je2v0,8530.0,MysteryDungeon

378,"I agreed with this headcanon for a while during my first playthrough of the game a few months back, but nowadays I just figured that the Teddiursa and Ursaring in Super are just a different pair from the one in Explorers, and just coincidentally have the same dilemma. Same with Lombre (from Pokémon Square), Snubbull (who hasn't evolved into Granbull), Poochyena (from Team Poochy), Mienfoo (from Post Town), and Murkrow (who was always with Shuppet in Team Ebony). 

Same with the Igglybuff in this game coincidentally having the same friends as Igglybuff the Prodigy had in Special Episode 2; a Wooper, Smoochum, and Budew. 

Sure, Super is supposed to be *the* game of cameos, but I feel not *every* Pokémon in the game is meant to be a past character. Some of the Pokémon chosen to be in the different villages and towns across the world are most likely meant to just be subtle references than actual re-appearances.

Bulbapedia seems to take your headcanon as fact, though, as it seems to treat all of these irrelevant towns-Pokémon as if they were the same ones from previous games. I can't really blame them, though--with everyone being named the same thing and some of these same Pokémon having similar personalities, it's hard to tell whether the game wants us to see certain Pokémon as cameos, subtle references, or different Pokémon entirely.

They're never consistent on whether they want this world to have *one* of each species of Pokémon or *many*. Because Team Poochy in Explorers was comprised of three Poochyena, and Shaymin Village was literally all Shaymin, who poked fun at how redundant and confusing it was that everyone looked, acted, and was named the same thing.",2016-06-21 05:49:00+00:00,d4ho9xv,2.0,t1_d4hhi9a,12950.0,MysteryDungeon
379,"A lot of people like it because it's adorable, and foxes are a really popular animal. It's also why Vulpix is a really popular Pokémon and why it was one of the more popular starter/partner choices in Explorers of Sky.

... Though Braixen is also a thing and adds to Fennekin's popularity, too. The fact that it got into Pokken over the less-liked Delphox (a lot of people aren't too into Delphox's design and prefer Fennekin and Braixen *a lot* more) says a lot about how popular the first two evolutions of this starter are. Braixen even made the *boxart* of PSMD, which was (for the most part) pretty much designed to be filled with the most popular forms of every single starter spanning all six generations. A lot of people just like the bipedal, more human-like designs, I guess. Just look at Riolu and Lucario.

And gameplay-wise, Fennekin being a Fire-type helps wreck house early-game, and its ability to learn a few Psychic-type adds a lot to its coverage, too. Psybeam is a ranged move that puts in a lot of work, for example; your required story missions with Espurr help show that. And I hear Fennekin's PSMD expression portraits are really adorable, and those play a huge part as to why people pick what Pokémon they play as through the story as well.

I picked Riolu and Pikachu for my PSMD file, though, so I never really got to see Fennekin in action or see very many of its portraits during the main story.",2016-06-21 04:48:53+00:00,d4hmqw4,1.0,t3_4p2ven,942.0,MysteryDungeon

381,"Here's my Top 5, in no particular order! 

* [Ancient Barrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAYnWiuOMuc) is one of my favorites. It's both creepy and unsettling while mixing in the feeling of determination the schoolkids feel when they brave through the dungeon to save their friends. It's the most epic-sounding dungeon theme in the entire story, and built up the climax of the first half of the story to be something grand--much grander than it actually was.

* [Revelation Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfTdm8S2r_o) is really ominous and foreboding. Compared to a lot of the other dungeon themes, you could almost hear an odd sense of both sorrow and tranquility in the track, and you could practically tell this place was important if the cutscenes didn't already drive that home already. I also like how this dungeon had [two versions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1xFiBrlwr4) that differed between the two times you climbed this place during the main story. The second really sets in the mood that something is very, very wrong, that tranquility gone and replaced with a sense of uneasiness.

* [A Warning to All Pokémon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O0KvAuqhJU) really drives home that false bad ending the game was trying to convey. I think this is the first time in PMD history where the antagonists had actually succeeded in their plans, at least for a little while. It gave me chills the first time I saw this track in action; the second time wasn't as effective because it felt like it was beating a dead horse, since Dark Matter's dialogue is literally a lot of what Yveltal had already talked about the first time, mentioned near-verbatim, and toward a much smaller audience than before, but it still helped make me feel utterly hopeless both times regardless. That build-up 0:52 always gets me; I like how the antagonists' themes all share that similar motifs. Fight with Yveltal and Others uses 0:52 as well in its climax, and the bells at the very beginning are also used in the Void Shadows theme and at the beginning of Surprise Attack: Yveltal!

* I also give [Ancient Letters Left Behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAolWkxSqxU) and [Prehistoric Ruins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O-fxkiu8T) props for sharing the same motif as well, considering they both share the same subject matter. Since the Prehistoric Ruins are practically PMD's equivalent to Atlantis, it makes me wonder what purpose that place served back in ancient times, since it was nowhere near the Tree of Life and Revelation Mountain, the two places its ancient writings attempted to warn other Pokémon about.

* And last but definitely not least, [School Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtrdYqHkURQ). I have a huge soft spot for that track. Its similar instrumentation to Let's Go to School!, its melody line, its place in the story... I love everything about it! I even made lyrics for it sometime back, though one glaring grammatical error I didn't notice until someone helped mentioned it takes away from them quite a bit.

386,"Oooh, now THIS is my kind of post! ♥

I had a ton of headcanons about the series, especially as a kid. I was happy to learn that a ton of other people shared my same thoughts as well, so much so that even the staff at Spike Chunsoft must have picked up on them and made a lot of them canon in Super Mystery Dungeon! (Or maybe it was just by coincidence that they made them canon. Who knows.)

Said childhood headcanons involved the Diglett and Dugtrio that got attacked by Skarmory being the same ones the joined Wigglytuff's Guild, Wigglytuff moving to form his own guild after running his Friend Area shop, and [Rescue Team spoilers](#s ""Medicham leaving Team Meanies and Gardevoir going off on her own to join Team Charm together."")

But now that Super's out, I have a few new headcanons of my own! Since [PSMD spoilers](#s ""Jirachi says he used to live in Star Cave before he joined the Expedition Society, I figured that could mean the Mawile and Ampharos from Explorers of Sky could have met up with Jirachi on the Grass Continent, the place the Explorers games take place, to help form it! Mawile could have left Team Frontier sometime after she met Ampharos near the top of Sky Peak, and after Spinda decided to retire from the café business to travel the world again."") 

I also like to think that [PSMD spoilers](#s ""the Nuzleaf that lives in Serene Village used to be one of the Nuzleaf that used to work for Team Shiftry. It sort of makes sense, because Dark Matter brainwashes Pokémon in a way that brings out their *own* evil, and doesn't make its minions evil on its own. That's why everyone remembers the horrible things they've done once their control is broken; for all they know, what they did was of their own will. Team Shiftry used to be a bunch of jerks, Yveltal surely must have enough sins crawling on his back being the ""taker of lives"", and who knows what the Beheeyem did in the past to make them more susceptible to Dark Matter's influence than the average Pokémon."")

As for headcanons about my own team, the partner from any of the PMD games in general (except for maybe Super's) is really easy to make up backstories for, considering you learn very little of them during the story, and the player character and supporting cast never really bother asking about them.

Unlike the headcanons above, I'm not trying to justify this next headcanon as something that *could* be canon; I know this probably isn't true, but it's something I personally like to assume. I like to think the Rescue Team partner's family lived in the house he gives you near Pokémon Square. His family had left him at an early age, and it had hurt him so much that he can't bear living in it anymore, and chooses to live in the nearby forests and plains out of town, near where he finds you at the beginning of the game. 

He's so grateful that he's found a new friend in you that he doesn't want to mention any traces of his past, placing any idle conversation on either his friendship with you, his dreams, or your own past instead. And it's also why he's so eager to remodel the place later on; to cast aside and bury the last traces of his past so he could see the house anew, as a symbol not of his rough childhood, but of his future with you.

And once you [](#s ""disappear"") at the end of the game, where is the spot you find your partner in? Right in front of your house, broken that this house once again acts as a place of [](#s ""sorrow"") for him.",2016-06-19 22:27:04+00:00,d4fuviv,1.0,t3_4out3z,10060.0,MysteryDungeon

As a kid, I always wished we got the opportunity to explore and walk around places like Treasure Town while it was dark out. Sure, it's just a small aesthetic change, but it really sets in a different kind of mood, y'know? Makes me wonder if Explorers' unused Good Night theme was meant for a late-night stroll like that.

Super finally managed to deliver that when it came to letting us wander around at night to do whatever about halfway through the game, and it was nice. The lack of music, your partner lagging behind you and being a wuss, seeing the village near-empty... All those cutscenes at the big tree when it was dark were really serene, too.

389,"I've actually found the Friend Bow more common in Explorers than in Rescue Team, tbh. I even vaguely remember finding some in Kecleon Shops for a high price at certain dungeons. They probably did this because it's overshadowed by all the much better recruitment items the Explorers games introduced like the Golden Mask or the Amber Tear.

In Rescue Team, I just clung onto the one you're able to get at Mt. Faraway for dear life because I didn't want to bother climbing that long ass mountain for another one. But that when I was a kid; if there were other, easier ways to obtain a Friend Bow (besides getting a WM code of course, but I chose not to use those) then I never knew about them.

And I think Kec's recruitment rate is always 0.1% at max in Rescue Team, while in Explorers it's bumped to 0.5%, which is why I picked that game instead of the other.",2016-06-18 04:29:30+00:00,d4dyuu8,3.0,t1_d4dyd5a,1066.0,MysteryDungeon

395,"You know, now that you put it that way, I actually agree with you a bit. While the Bittercold and Dark Matter were definitely *unexpected* as additions to the game, I always found it strange how some significant legendaries got the shaft in the PMD gens they were introduced.

Reshiram and Zekrom haven't done anything relevant in either of the PMD games their in. Their biggest role so far is them showing up in a cutscene for a whopping 10 seconds freaking out over Pokémon turning to stone. Same with Kyogre, who got the shaft in Rescue Team when Groudon, Rayquaza, and Deoxys stole the show (but for good reason; the continent Rescue Team took place in was nowhere near the coast, so water-based natural disasters wouldn't exactly be a problem, and Kyogre was apparently conveniently fast asleep during the main story anyway).

As for Super, Yveltal could've easily taken the place of Dark Matter as the main villain as well. I didn't exactly like how Yveltal was treated as an expendable pawn and scapegoat for Dark Matter in the end, and ended up being irrelevant to the story as a whole.

Yveltal could easily have wanted to turn Pokémon to stone and kill everyone because he could no longer bare the burden of taking life after life, and after having witnessed the Pokémon world go sour, he could have deemed the entire world unfit for life, passing his power onto Nuzleaf and the Beheeyem to petrify any Pokémon in their way as Yveltal overpowered Xerneas.

Yveltal and Dark Matter literally give pretty much the exact same speech, some of their dialogue being literally a word-for-word copy of the same sentences reused between both characters. ",2016-06-15 10:15:36+00:00,d49zq5v,5.0,t1_d49yr5r,3421.0,MysteryDungeon
396,"EYYY I loved Spinda's Café and IQ too! IQ didn't feel grind-y to me at all--it always felt like a fun, optional thing you could do to pretty much break the game and make every dungeon a cakewalk if you so desired.

It was fun to see what shake you would get and how each food item would affect you at Spinda's Café, and it felt so satisfying to get max stars and every skill you could get!

The DS games are still more than playable even with if neither you or any of your recruits had never eaten any Gummis or stat-boosting items at all, so I don't see 1stJusticebringer's point there. As a kid I spent the entire main story of Rescue Team with half a star of IQ each, but adjusted my playstyle to make sure my teammates wouldn't do anything too stupid as I got better. Simple as that.

Gates and Super just make all of that easier, and while that's nice and convenient, and definitely feels less clunky than having to deal with a really dumb partner when going through dungeons, IQ and Gummis just brought a sense of wonder and accomplishment wondering what cool new ability you'll get next and how far you've come as an adventurer once you see all the neat stuff you can do.

Emeras provide a similar rush in Super, since a lot of them are just IQ skills put into temporary use and found at random intervals, and while I love the emera system, it just doesn't feel the same.

And Team Skills in Gates just felt dirty. They didn't feel earned. And getting them from chests just felt too unrealistic for me, even for a Pokémon game.

Also, props on being an Espurr fan, too! She was actually who I named this profile after when I first discovered Reddit and this sub when I finished Super for the first time. She's adorable.

And I do agree that throwing a ton of plot at you at once is rarely effective, at least when Pokémon games are concerned. I like some good, gradual, legit build-up and some confrontations before the big climax, not having everything be peaceful and then throwing everything including the climax. :l

Gates did this relatively well, but while Super's foreshadowing was fairer and more clever, the antagonists' plan was thrown at you all at once and was resolved as quickly as it started. Once the event at Revelation Mountain happened, the entire game focused on saving the world and nothing else when nearly everything before it just teased it while you went on happy-go-lucky adventures, with the world being at peace the entire time.",2016-06-15 06:52:04+00:00,d49w1uf,3.0,t1_d49iiq0,24928.0,MysteryDungeon

398,"I personal give Super some slack when it comes to not going as in-depth into its plot and characters as it could have because I felt the developers *knew* it was never going to get DLC or a DLC re-release like Sky did in accordance with Time and Darkness.

Gates of all games definitely deserved story-related DLC like Sky did, but got a bunch of extra, pointless dungeons instead that either helped make the game easier than it already was, or gave excruciatingly difficult dungeons for all the PMD veterans out there. A huge missed opportunity, too, considering Gates had the most developed cast and had plenty of ideas and plot points available for some Special Episodes to expand on them.

Sky sort of cheated by releasing an already-established game with a few DLC packs and minor changes for FULL PRICE, only a YEAR after Time/Darkness came out. It was definitely an unfair business decision for people who played Time/Darkness only to be told, ""Hey, here's a better version, Time/Darkness are actually a waste of time, buy this one too.""

If Rescue Team, Gates, and Super got an edited/uncut version akin to Sky they could bank on, then surely they would all have more fleshed out stories as well. But they didn't. And I applaud Super's staff for working with what they had--the schoolkids and partner were developed well enough and had good chemistry with each other, as was the relationship between the kids and their parents. Other story elements were rushed, but heck, Time/Darkness weren't exactly the most polished games on their own, either.

It's why I personally prefer to set Sky on its own caliber and give the other PMD games a more fair comparison toward Time/Darkness instead.",2016-06-14 00:33:20+00:00,d482xf8,2.0,t1_d480ty4,3163.0,MysteryDungeon
399,"I see what you mean with your argument against the EXP Share. I remember spending so many hours grinding up a Gastly, Meditite, and Ekans to make a competent recreation of Team Meanies to play with in Rescue Team. But that was when I was a kid--while it did feel accomplishing to finally train up other Pokémon I wanted to use, the old recruitment system had its issues as well. Especially in Rescue Team, with bosses having low percentages to make you needlessly go through the same dungeons over and over. Especially if they were 99 floors. Felt like a waste effort going through places like Western Cave multiple times only to not get a reward for conquering daunting challenges like those. At least Purity Forest guaranteed you Celebi, but Wish Cave and Silver Trench were often slippery slopes that made me debate whether they were worth going through.

But you do make a fair argument in saying that the new EXP system makes the older dungeons near-obsolete. I can agree with that. 

And I guess I can agree with your gripes against non-Pokémon entities. It's a hit-or-miss thing, really. Some people mind them, others don't. Other Pokémon spin-offs have started having non-Pokémon entities as antagonists, too, like Dark Rust in one of the Pokémon Rumble games.

It does get a bit predictable when the more menacing-looking Pokémon turn out to be the bad guys. Darkrai was made the villain in at least three spin-off series games. Yveltal's a pretty obvious choice for a villain, too, considering his design just screams ""evil"". Pokémon like Munna I didn't see coming at first, though.

Though personally, while I felt the Bittercold was justified as a villain considering Gates's constant themes of despair and depression, I'd rather have had Yveltal be a villain rather than Dark Matter, which had very little justification for being in the story *at all*. And if the writers really didn't want to make Yveltal evil, the least they could've done was make him an atoneable villain.",2016-06-13 22:34:50+00:00,d47y4p3,3.0,t1_d47vy3i,3062.0,MysteryDungeon
400,"Chatot's thing about Wigglytuff in Super was just a translation error. Everyone else in Super refers to Wigglytuff as a male except for Chatot that one time. Some past character's laughs are changed, too, with Gengar saying ""Hee-hee"" instead of ""Keheheh"" in Baram Town.

Anyway. I actually liked the Gen 6 EXP Share idea applied to Gates and Super. It actually motivated me to want to use my recruits. In Rescue Team and Explorers, I always found raising another team member to be a bit of a drag because I would often find myself raising Level 5's or Level 20's up to my hero's and partner's levels, who were often thirty levels higher than everyone else. I grind enough for my main two Pokémon as it is--spending even more time on another Pokémon or two just felt tedious, and while I had all the time in the world to do so as a kid tinkering with Rescue Team, that isn't so much the case when I got slightly older with Explorers, or even now that I'm an adult.

I don't like the 6th gen EXP Share in the main games because it's easy enough to grind up a team of six (and above as it was), and made the games too easy. In PMD, it just makes playing as/with other team members more convenient.

Though while I agree that a lot of the other gameplay elements Gates added and changed made the game subpar at best, the story was decent enough to get me invested, as was Super's. Gates's and Super's cast of characters were definitely memorable to me as well, as they all had established personalities and a depth to them that many of Rescue Team's and Explorers' supporting cast didn't. 

Gates had the strongest and most well-rounded cast to me. I actually felt like I was in a team of friends who all contributed to the story as much as the player character did. In Explorers, the Guild was definitely memorable, sure, with their constant catchphrases and them being around literally *all the time*, but if you took them out of the story completely (aside from Wigglytuff and Chatot, of course), literally nothing would change. 

I also don't mind adding non-Pokémon entities in the game because they've been a thing since the very first PMD game. The Judge of Darkness, the voice at Luminous Cave, the voice at Luminous Spring? All non-Pokemon entities from Rescue Team and Explorers. The Bittercold, Void Shadows, and Dark Matter aren't that far off from those, imo. And if humans in the human world can coexist with animals and a ton of other different life forms, adding non-Pokémon creatures in the PMD world helps make the series more unpredictable and interesting. As long as the writers keep up different twists to make it so, at least.

Also, the first two games did have a lesson or two; they just weren't as preachy about it. Grovyle spends several sections of Special Episode 5 talking about his viewpoint on life and how you should spend it, for example. 

And sure, while I found Sky more fun and replayable, I didn't think Gates and Super bad by any means. All of the PMD games have their faults, but I personally found Super to be just below Explorers when it comes to managing a decent story while being a polished game. 

So while you're free to not like the 3D games--I can see why many wouldn't--I personally like them for what they are.",2016-06-13 21:26:05+00:00,d47v66t,1.0,t3_4nxurh,1001.0,MysteryDungeon
401,"Oooh, I definitely agree! The dissonance in a lot of Open Pass's opening chords definitely set in that feeling of confusion, just like Ochre Quarry's sudden, wacky opening.

Withered Savannah really fits the atmosphere of the dungeon, imo. More so than a lot of Gates's earlier dungeon themes, which seemed to be more general and whimsical to me. 

And you definitely bring up a fair point! Withered Savannah was a great point when it came to deciding what the main character valued more and whether saving your partner was a worthwhile risk to take when making the trek back to Post Town. Now that I remember it more clearly, it was a great turning point to further develop the relationship between you and your partner!",2016-06-13 20:06:10+00:00,d47rghw,3.0,t1_d47q1tq,1750.0,MysteryDungeon
402,"Ochre Quarry is great because it personifies Hydreigon's silliness and uncharacteristic behavior well. It also reflects the player character's emotions around this time as well, as if even the music is in agreement in saying, ""I don't know what the heck is going on but I might as well go with it since HOLY MOLEY THIS GUY IS LEVEL 64""

But Withered Savannah has a special place in my heart because that track specifically was what got me wanting to pay closer attention to Gates' soundtrack as a whole. I always thought Ragged Mountain and Hazy Pass were nice, but hearing the build-up and sense of adventure in this track, as well as the instrumentation fitting the landscape and dungeon's name really made me love going through this dungeon on my first playthrough way back in ye olden days of 2013, and it really made me appreciate the other tracks in the game more as well, even if Gates's soundtrack overall sounds somewhat more lighthearted than the other games, dungeon-wise.

Withered Savannah, Holehills, and Reverse Mountain all have a similar theme of slowly but surely building up an amazing climax to their respective tracks and I like that, considering all three of them are pretty important story-wise. Though Withered Savannah is probably the least important of the three, considering it was just an ""in-between"" dungeon to get some more exposition out of the way before you rescue your partner.",2016-06-13 18:36:59+00:00,d47n42o,1.0,t3_4n7uwa,416860.0,MysteryDungeon

404,"Players who don't like to use their items very often and like to over-conserve everything they find suffer in this game, because enemy Pokémon will always be several levels higher than you throughout the main story, with moves that often one-shot you or do tons of damage in one turn, like Razor Wind, Discharge, or multi-hit moves like Rollout or Arm Thrust.

Using your Wands wisely and as often as possible often helps, but sometimes enemy Pokémon like Heliolisk are out of reach and end up spamming Razor Wind in large, open rooms that take several steps to escape from. 

Orbs are scarce, and while Tiny Reviver Seeds are cheaper in stores and more common overall, they tend to get used up quickly.

Using tons of Emeras for both stat boosts AND Looplet usage was something that didn't cross my mind until late-game, and not many others either, from what I've seen, because it was a whole new concept to wrap our head around at the time, and not many used them to their fullest when we needed them most early on.

I also chose not to use Blast Seeds, which definitely changed a lot. They do 75 damage when thrown and 100 damage when eaten. Those definitely make the game a lot easier since they're not uncommon, but I decided against using them because I figured they would be too OP.",2016-06-12 21:37:25+00:00,d46hz4v,3.0,t1_d46ed2s,4468.0,MysteryDungeon
405,"Part of the partner in Explorers being a bit obnoxious was just the localization team making a somewhat awkward translation of the game. Sure, plenty of Japanese media might have a habit of repeating a person's name over and over to make them look cute or to give them character, but that doesn't always work with English. 

If the dialogue was rewritten to be a bit less repetitive, and if your partner didn't say your name every other sentence, then surely his personality and the rest of the game's text would be more bearable.

After all, Super's partner was *meant* to be annoying, but the translation for that game was so much smoother than Explorers by comparison that it didn't faze me that much until the end of the game.

Unlike what some people believe, there *is* such a thing as being *too* faithful when translating something from one language to another. Sometimes liberties have to be made to make sentences and conversations flow more smoothly without sounding awkward--and sometimes humor has to be changed and altered to be more appealing to a different audience. Explorers had some great lines, but having everyone constantly repeat the same sentences over and over and over made me want to skip parts of it during recurring playthroughs now that I'm older and know better. Super still does this every now and then, but to a somewhat lesser extent.

I understand what they were going for with the partner from Explorers--heck, I related to him a lot when I was a kid, being in a similar friendship myself in school when I picked Explorers of Darkness up for the first time--but I feel like they should've proofread his dialogue a bit more.",2016-06-12 14:26:24+00:00,d45zrdu,3.0,t1_d45rdd6,26922.0,MysteryDungeon

408,"I agree completely, but if I remember correctly, In the Hands of Fate played when you and your partner were mourning over Grovyle's sacrifice, not when your partner was mourning you at the beach at the end of the main story. So it was always meant to be a generic emotional cutscene track.

The main story's ending had completely custom music that never played anywhere else--Don't Ever Forget and Memories Returned are among those, and they definitely did a good job tearing me apart.

I also feel the Explorers' post-game was a bit rushed near the end. Having you start off by graduating from the Guild was nice, but after that, you just had isolate adventure after isolated adventure that, in the end, had *nothing* to do with the plot it was building up. While all those ""filler"" events like saving Scizor, climbing Sky Peak, and raising Manaphy were fun and all, and they each had their stand-out moments, but aside from that one cutscene at Luminous Spring and a cutscene of Cresselia chasing Darkrai, the Darkrai plot had very little build-up. Once you start dreaming about Cresselia, the plot picks up *immediately*.

People say Super's first half was pointless, but literally 75% of Explorers' post-game was filler. At least Super dedicated its first half to establishing your relationship with your partner, Nuzleaf, Espurr, and Ampharos, all of whom played a part later in the game, as well as making you build an attachment to Serene Village so you could feel something when the world is screwed over. Those premonition cutscenes with everyone freaking out about the turning-to-stone incidents were foreshadowed the same way Cresselia chasing Darkrai was, but then you have the Ancient Barrow, which literally went out of its way to parallel and foreshadow the last dungeon of the game. And there was Revelation Mountain Part 1, too. Both of those did a great job at actively letting us know something big was coming.

Explorers' main story doesn't foreshadow Darkrai or Cresselia in the least, either--the least they could've done was had Grovyle, some other Pokémon of the future, or you/your partner question how Temporal Tower collapsed in the first place and who or what might have caused the planet's paralysis, but no one ever brings it up, which gives some players even less incentive into really caring about that topic in the first place. 

Grovyle mentioned ""turbulence"" when he was attacked while you and he were traveling back to the past, but he doesn't bother thinking about who or what must have caused said turbulence. It could've easily have been Dusknoir, Primal Dialga, or heck, some botched explanation that ""time travel does mysterious things sometimes"" and it *still* would've felt more conclusive of an explanation when put in context of the main story alone.

I also didn't like the explanation Darkrai gave as to how you became a Pokémon very much. Sure, they *may* have been consistent with each Dinensional Hole victim losing their memory, but why did *I* turn into a Pokémon? Darkrai didn't turn into anything odd. It just feels so tacked on and inconsistent compared to everything else they've established. Just like the Personality Quiz. Did Darkrai give that, too? 

Rescue Team and Super had valid-enough explanations for why both games had their Personality Quizzes, but Explorers...didn't. 

I also think they didn't do that good of a job establishing what Darkrai's powers are and what his limitations would be. He can obviously give nightmares like in the main series games, and shroud himself in darkness to cause illusions I can buy, but distorting space? Making Dimensional Holes on his own? Traveling through time? How...? 

Unless this is the event Darkrai that knew Roar of Time and Spacial Rend we're dealing with, I'm not sure if those abilities are very consistent with the canon. But then again, Kyurem being able to tell the future in Gates isn't, either, so I guess it's just a small nitpick on my part.

And don't worry, I'm passionate about these types of things, too! Explorers of Sky is arguably my favorite PMD game overall but I still like to look at it as objectively as possible and pick apart its flaws as much as its strengths.",2016-06-12 02:29:25+00:00,d45khj4,1.0,t3_4no7tf,4122.0,MysteryDungeon

412,"Oh! And I was also a tiny bit disappointed that the character cameos in this game weren't as big or as relevant to the story as I thought they would be. The game was hyping up that all these past characters would be returning, and even made a whole poster of them overshadowing the NEW Pokémon that actually played a part in the story.

Sure, the little nods were nice, like seeing some of these guys out in the overworld every so often, but I wish they had more to say than just a couple one-liners. 

The only past characters who actually played a part in the plot were Jirachi and Officer Magnezone. And Xatu might be debatable. Even with the Great Canyon music and the Hill of the Ancients clone, who knows if this Xatu is the same one from Rescue Team or Explorers. 

But if you want to apply some headcanons here and there, technically, Nuzleaf, Ampharos, and Mawile were past characters as well, but that's stretching it a bit.

Grovyle's, Pink Celebi's, and Dusknoir's missions were nice, with a mini arc and nice interaction between them that helped show what they've been doing lately. 

Wigglytuff's Guild had a pretty funny arc as well, with everyone searching all over the world for Wigglytuff, only to go through several missions and find out he just wanted some alone time from Chatot. You also got to find out who graduated over the years and who's still training. 

Absol's and Ninetails's was nice, too. Absol got some nice expansion to his character and the both of them have apparently been investigating human activity in this world.

But then you have some cameos that kinda feel like they were thrown in there just for the sake of being thrown in there. When I saw that promotional poster highlighting all the significant character cameos, I expected Team ACT to actually kind of show up instead of being an indirect recruit you got early on to use as a crutch, for example. Also, who in the heck was that Seviper that joined me along with them? Whiscash has some strange friends.

Getting legendaries like Shaymin and Victini JUST by chatting with them was also a bit anticlimactic. But eh.

Also, Caterpie and Butterfree are on the poster, too, and while it's sweet that they added the very first Pokémon we rescued and interacted with from the very first game, it's difficult to tell whether the Caterpie we run into in Serene Village is the same one from Rescue Team. I don't think Butterfree's dialogue really hints at anything with her, either.

Hell, Shinx and Skitty are on it, and they're not even starters! They're not even character cameos, either--they're just generic NPCs in this game!",2016-06-11 03:51:38+00:00,d44jcqk,1.0,t3_4njorz,4909.0,MysteryDungeon
413,"Some of the townsfolk in both Serene Village and Lively Town. I'm not sure if some of these Pokémon are supposed to be cameos, or completely different Pokémon that happen to be of the same species!

Like, at several points during the Serene Village arc, you meet an Igglybuff, who's friends with Wooper, Budew, and Smoochum. These are the exact same Pokémon Igglybuff the future Guildmaster Prodigy was friends with in Special Episode 2. Surely this specific selection of Pokémon was a reference to the episode itself--after all, THIS Igglybuff even has his own mission to deliver something to Armaldo, who IS the same Armaldo from Sky--but they never explain what this new Igglybuff's story is, what his relation to Guildmaster Wigglytuff is in this game, where he and the other baby Pokémon live in the village, etc. 

There's also a Teddiursa and Ursaring who show up every now and then who have the same dilemma the Teddiursa and Ursaring from Explorers had when it came to evolving, but this time around, the Teddiursa decides not to evolve. Are these the same ones from the last game? Or is this a completely different duo altogether that just happen to have similar chemistry?

Same problem with Lombre (from Pokémon Square), Snubbull (who evolved in Pokémon Square), Murkrow (from Team Ebony), and Mienfoo (from Post Town). They're all non-generic, static townsfolk that share the same species with past non-generic, static townsfolk from past games, too. 

This also goes back to the post I made recently about how Pokémon are named in this world. Makes it hard to tell if the developers are slipping in a reference or a cameo or if they're just adding new irrelevant NPCs that just happen to be the same species. A lot of the other, more obvious cameos directly state what they did in the game they originated in, so that makes it a bit easier, but as for the rest... It's weird.

And apparently, it's so unclear that some people on this sub--and even on Bulbapedia!--even claim that these ARE the same Pokémon from the past games, and some wibbly wobbly timey wimey shenanigans happened that added all these different Pokémon from all these different times together at once. I personally don't buy that theory at all, but I guess that just goes to show how awkward it gets when the developers repeat new Pokémon that happen to be the same species as others we were already introduced.

Also, I had no idea you could actually revisit Serene Village until the post-game. Now I'm a bit saddened I didn't get to read all the extra dialogue from the villagers during the second half of the main story. I always loved going around and reading what everyone had to say.

This was just a small nitpick, by the way. This wasn't a big deal to me at all, despite my large wall of text in this, but it was just odd enough that I needed to vent on it.",2016-06-11 03:32:39+00:00,d44ipfw,1.0,t3_4njorz,3770.0,MysteryDungeon

415,"Don't get me wrong, I'm aware that Yokai Watch has several differences between it and Pokémon, and it takes away some enjoyment from me as well whenever I think of the two as fierce rivals instead of two separate series that can coexist together for different reasons.

I'm not too familiar with Shin Megami Tensei, but comparing FF to the M&amp;L games is a bit of a stretch when it comes to comparing two series that share more than a few trivial similarities between both gameplay, plot, and lore. While Pokémon and Yokai Watch are both very different games, they do share enough small similarities that *somewhat* justify how these overexaggerations cropped up in the first place when people comparing the two.

I just thought the picture in the post I linked was interesting and that it could spark some discussion, is all, whether its points have any merit to it or not.

I saw a parts of a playthrough to Yokai Watch and thought it looked fun. And don't worry, you don't have to read through the comments! The picture was all you had to read through. I just wanted to credit the original post I found it from.

I've never played any of the PokePark games, and don't really plan on playing them, but I do appreciate that they--along with the other spin-offs--give some of the spotlight to other Pokémon the main series games don't usually pay much attention to.

417,"There have actually been several cases before where Pokémon could speak--in the anime, Team Rocket's Meowth is the most known out of all of them, as well as several legendaries (i.e., Mewtwo, Lugia, or some that cheat like Shaymin and Keldeo). The various manga series have a few as well. But while the main series games haven't had a single talking Pokémon in their entirety, the topic of this happening has been foreshadowed and rambled on about by various NPCs since Gen 3 (albeit unintentionally, but Gen 3 has ""foreshadowed"" a lot of aspects future Pokémon games would add, like the ability to see into Pokémon's dreams in Gen 5).

So while I'm surprised at how soon this happened and how they went about this, I think this is just the next logical step the series can take at this point.

I like both the main series games and PMD roughly equally, though; variety is the spice of life, and sometimes I get burned out on one side of the Pokémon fandom and delve into the other.

But when it comes down to it, I personally do like the PMD series a bit more than the main series games, though, and I do tend to associate them with *waaayyy* more things than I should, even if they're completely unrelated to the series as a whole.

As much as I'm ashamed to say it, while I was seeing X-Men: Apocalypse a few days ago, the first thing that came to mind during three particular scenes in the movie was [PSMD spoilers](#s ""Yveltal's warning to all Pokémon in the world; Dark Matter's warning to all Pokémon in the world; and Nuzleaf, the Beheeyem, and Yveltal betraying Dark Matter and fighting it only to get blown back and beaten relatively easily, in that order"") And that's just one of a few other examples where I've probably had PMD on the brain for way too long and probably more than I should. xD

I'm also only one of my friends who really plays PMD at all to begin with; they all play and talk about the main series games. My only other friend who enjoyed PMD (up until Sky, that is) moved to study abroad after our senior year in high school recently.

ANYWAY. While the first thing that came to mind when I saw Rotom-Dex being announced was PMD, and later the rationalization that the earlier main series games had talked to this, I later saw a post on the main Pokémon subreddit that theorized that Rotom-Dex could just be Game Freak's answer and equivalent to Whisper from the Yokai Watch games. Which makes sense, considering both series have been in fierce competition as of late, and they both have their similarities. 

My comment's already running way too long at this point, so instead of re-explaining what I read there, here's the link to the post!: https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/4md8kv/it_seems_like_pokémon_is_going_to_compete_even/

It's actually pretty interesting, and while it does have plenty of reasonable counterarguments to go against this theory, it just feels worth noting and funny to think about.

... But now I'm wondering how Rotom-Dex will be integrated into the next PMD. *If* it is, anyway. After all, Genesect, Reshiram, and Zekrom never got big roles in Gates or Super. And PMD *does* like to stretch the rules a bit when it comes to what certain Pokémon can and can't do (Kyurem seeing the future, Darkrai traveling through time and space, Porygon having some dominion over space, etc.).

418,"Personally, I disagree with Gates's execution of its philosophy as well. I personally think Rescue Team took what could technically be considered the same philosophy and executed it a tiny bit better, even if it didn't preach it anywhere nearly as much. 

But I do like the contrast between each and every PMD games' ideologies and messages.

Explorers preaches that we should live to make a name of ourselves, and to make the most of it to the best of our ability, so we can be remembered and immortalized by as many people, events, and objects as we can, so our name and legacy will live on in others.

Gates preaches the opposite--that we should still make the most of our lives, but one's legacy is irrelevant. We should be content with the bonds we share while we're alive and do our best in everything we do regardless of whether we're remembered for them or not.

Neither way is wrong; and everyone is free to choose which path they want to live depending on what they want to revolve their life around. Though I like that it goes in-depth into both perspectives and doesn't argue the other as wrong.

What I love about this series is that there are many other topics and plot points that can be compared and contrasted between all of the games, like how to go about handling others' hope and negativity, or how to carry yourself when it feels like everyone and everything is out to get you, or seeing how other characters react when they feel like they don't have a place in this world. 

Instead of rehashing the same lessons over and over, it takes the same ones and instead handles them differently each time, and I like that.",2016-06-06 08:13:21+00:00,d3xu2c0,2.0,t1_d3xgkfr,27150.0,MysteryDungeon

420,"I personally liked PSMD's push for you to use the different items it introduced. The older PMD games really made it kind of difficult for certain types of Pokémon to progress in the story just because they can't learn some really broken move or are weak to the majority of the enemy Pokémon they'll encounter.

For example, in Rescue Team, any starter with Smokescreen or Attract, or whoever manages to land enough Mud Slaps makes the game a breeze, regardless of what items you bring, while most Grass-types are left in the dust because pretty much everything is super-effective against them and not many of them get very good moves leveling up to help fight back.

Super fixes this by not only distributing enemy Pokémon in a somewhat more fair way, but also making you use the valuables you find on the ground on every dungeon to equalize everyone. Think the enemy Pokémon are too strong? Use your emeras on yourself to get a ton of stat boosts. Need a certain skill to get past a certain floor faster? Attach some emeras to a looplet. Need some help to whittle away at or to get away from a Pokémon you know you can't beat? Use an orb, seed, or wand.

But I personally don't think it forces items on you so much that it makes Pokémon moves and types are irrelevant by comparison. I'd say it evens the importance of both pretty evenly. Ghost-types and Ground-types now have their immunities back in Super, so you now have to actually watch what Pokémon you bring to a dungeon again (when back then, it didn't really matter what type you were if you were strong enough) and moves constantly upgrade the more you use them to get stronger, get more PP, or become more accurate.

What I dislike about some RPGs is that anyone can make the game a cakewalk if they grind enough and overlevel themselves, but Super limits yourself so much that you actually have to think about every move you're going to make before you get absolutely DESTROYED immediately. Should I use this item here or save it? What move should I use? Should I eat this Oran Berry now to give myself that temporary HP boost or keep it for later? Maybe I should walk away hoping this move misses or doesn't hit me...

You also didn't need a *particular* item to do good; nearly any wand out there can work wonders on any opponent. Even if you just roid yourself up on emeras for quick stat boosts.

I was rarely kept on my toes this often when I played the older games. I usually just brute forced my way through everything, and rarely grinded. Sure, slowly raising your IQ and constantly visiting the Marowak Dojo for some early-game levels felt rewarding overtime, but it didn't really do much for the game's difficulty. Just made the game easier. And even then, the older games *still* punished you for not bringing the right item--fighting through a Monster House is near-impossible if you don't have a good Orb on you (or a room-clearing move).

Super's difficulty, however, seemed to remain stagnant throughout the entire main story. It relied on your skill as both a Pokémon *and* an item-user rather than just being a Pokémon and getting unlucky if you weren't blessed with a good typing from the Personality Quiz. Sure, it's system isn't perfect--Vitamins are a cheap way to steamroll everything in your path, and sometimes the dungeons get pretty unfair really early on, with moves like Razor Wind in wide open rooms you can't walk away from fast enough--and while moments like those were rage-inducing, it taught me to be less frugal with my items; something I was a LOT more stingy with in the older games, and it only made me better as a result.",2016-06-02 21:51:07+00:00,d3to3i3,1.0,t3_4m935l,6501.0,MysteryDungeon
421,"While everything aalp234 said is true, I would suggest playing them in the order the games were released in (chronological order, pretty much). Playing the newer games first might make it a bit difficult to adjust to and properly enjoy the older games, because a lot of the gameplay features of the series had been vastly polished and improved overtime. 

So I suggest starting out with Rescue Team (either Red or Blue, doesn't make a difference), then Explorers of Sky (Time/Darkness are a waste of time and money in comparison).

A lot of people dislike Gates to Infinity, but I personally didn't *hate* playing through it when I bought it on release for the first time. It had a solid story and some of the new gameplay features it added were actually for the better of the series, but it also took a lot of older features away that the older games had, and not many people liked it for that. It's more story-driven than the others, and it it's probably the shortest game out of all of them, so if you plan on playing it, I suggest not playing past the Worldcore arc to save you some grief. Literally nothing happens after that. I know from months of experience and wasted effort, trust me. 

If you don't want to play Gates after hearing this, though, I at least suggest watching a playthrough of it or something. It really does have some good moments. 

As for Super, the newest game, I definitely suggest playing through it and buying it after playing through the others. It has the best, most fleshed-out gameplay in the series (for the most part; it pretty much took a lot of the best features from every game and made them better, while adding new things of its own). The story is nice as well, and people often praise it for being better than Gates as a 3DS game.

So yeah. Pretty much, do play them in chronological order. Playing the older games really makes you appreciate the newer games' improvements more. I personally don't like the idea of playing what people consider the ""best game"" first, because that usually just sets people up to be disappointed with the series after playing all the others; I feel it should be a more gradual and subjective experience. 

Also, try not to let all the hype around Sky get to you. Too many people like comparing every other PMD game to Sky (be it nostalgia or otherwise) and it detracts them and others from the experience of getting to properly enjoy any other PMD game ever because their expectations are overinflated.

Same for people who put too much hate on Gates, or people who over-praise any game, really. All in all, it's your decision to enjoy whichever game you want the most and play them however you like. I personally treat each game as a separate experience to keep myself from constantly comparing one to the other outside of fun debate or discussion.",2016-06-02 16:30:49+00:00,d3t9f4k,1.0,t3_4m7uc8,2036.0,MysteryDungeon
422,"I'd hope for some worthwhile changes to the game that make it feel like both a new, fresh experience while still keeping it a nostalgic one. Adding Mega Evolution and subtle references to the other PMD games would definitely make Rescue Team fit more into the canon Super tried to establish.

For example, maybe they'd give a couple more hints that Diglett, Dugtrio, and Wigglytuff later form a Guild in the Grass Continent, and we'd maybe have a short post-game NPC arc with them. Or maybe they'd mention that Luminous Cave has ties to Luminous Water and the Tree of Life, and that's why it allows Pokémon to evolve. Perhaps even Team Meanies could split at some point, showing Medicham parting ways with Gengar and Ekans to become an *alluring treasure hunter*, inspiring Gardevoir to join her. The Magnemite might also start thinking about forming a police agency to make sure the world stays at peace after seeing your team in action, after saving the world.

And they could also add that Spinda has plans of settling down for a bit somewhere to allow other Pokémon to have adventures as thrilling as the ones he had, with Wynaut and Wobbuffet joining him at some point. I'd also hope Spinda mentions Ampharos in some way or another, since they both have the *same* running gag of having a bad sense of direction. But I guess they could save that for an Explorers remake with Ampharos and Mawile meeting on Sky Peak.~

Maybe Team ACT could Mega Evolve at some point, or maybe you'll finally get to fight them sometime after the main story. It felt nice being told you surpassed them after you beat Groudon, but I always wanted the chance to actually fight them.

Maybe they'd also edit the story accordingly to have Gengar's plans make more sense. Nothing he did throughout the game amounted to anything close to ""world domination"". His plans were either stupid and petty or cruel and brutal. No in-betweens.

His plan to kill you literally had no foresight, too; if everyone in Pokémon Square *succeeded* in killing you, and the natural disasters still continued, they'd probably be after him next. Either this was a legit foresight the writers missed, or they wanted to make out that Team *Meanies* were never meant to be serious, intelligent villains; that they just got their lucky break here and got to boss everyone around for a bit.

But I don't want Gengar to be an overly-tragic character with tragic motivations. I hope he stays an irredeemable jerk through and through, and that he still has to deal with consequences for his actions, even after trying to repent and revive Gardevoir. All the other PMD games had the habit of making nearly every loose end wrapped up in a nice, happy bow with everyone getting what they want in the end. Gengar didn't get everything he originally wanted and had to learn to accept that, to mature and live happy with what he had. That's what made him and his plot line unique and I hope they don't edit his post-game arc just to give him a *completely* happy ending like they did with every other character in the series.

I don't think I would want all 720+ Pokémon in it, though; if they did add them all, they'd have to add a *ton* more Friend Areas, and expand them greatly. It was already a disorganized process as it was; I'd rather just have all 386 (with maybe a few more) to recruit.

I'd also love it if the games had Super's partner AI, shared EXP throughout your whole party, and motivated Pokémon. Those three additions really helped push me to actually *want* to use recruits *other* than myself and my partner, and made me *want* to recruit 'em all. Having set teams made the whole process more organized as well. I never cared to recruit 'em all back then, and Super's additions really helped with making me want to.

Updating the item set to include all the future items the later games introduced would be nice, too! All the new Seeds, Orbs, Wands, and held items we got later? Some people might argue it would make the game too easy--because part of what made Rescue Team difficult was the lack of variety in items you got and how much you had to brute force your way through everything if you didn't have the right moves--but since it's a remake, I think that's more of a justified reason to update the game to that extent.

I also hope they find some way to make certain held items, Looplets, Emeras, and Gummis co-exist somehow without making the other obsolete or redundant. I personally liked Emeras; they kept the game more balanced and interesting long-term, while consuming too many Gummis and maxing out your IQ will literally break the game for you, making it waaaayyy too easy, even if it felt rewarding as HELL to finally get to break walls and move through all kinds of terrain.

Also, cinematic cutscenes! Super did an *amazing* job with those, and seeing that same treatment to Rescue Team's cutscenes would be great!

And let's not forget Special Episodes! There aren't many that could really be done for Rescue Team's cast, but maybe one could be written for Team ACT's past and Lucario, one on Team Shiftry and maybe even a certain Nuzleaf (ohohoho), and one on Gengar and Team Meanies, how they formed, and how they might split in the post-game?",2016-06-01 16:46:45+00:00,d3rwz9v,1.0,t3_4m22f3,1581.0,MysteryDungeon

And that's mainly because they'd have to somehow re-implement stuff like Paradise since it's right next to Post Town, or Pokémon Square's Pelipper Post Office even though Pelipper Island is now a different main menu screen option. They'd also have to take out the Makuhita and Marowak Dojo, the Link Shops...and then people would complain that they were given ""watered-down and edited"" versions of the older towns.

So the devs must have figured it was easier to just make all new towns across the world instead of having us see all the old ones again. The continents still look the same, at least. They also decided to have all the past characters randomly traveling around from continent to continent, exploring the world. That's why they appear at random places across the map.

I kinda like seeing these new places, personally. Gives each continent more depth to it and establishes that more than one town *does* exist in each continent. Plus, Noe Town is really cool. ♥

I'm not sure if this is 100% true or not, so anyone correct me if I'm wrong, but I've heard from many people over the past several months since Super came out that evolving your main character and partner doesn't increase stats in the slightest, and that it's a purely aesthetic change, unlike [spoilers](#s ""your Harmony Scarf evolutions, which literally doubled your stats."")

So if this is true, then there's literally no benefit to evolving in this game unless you really like the look of your characters' evolved form. Mega Evolving doesn't increase your stats, either. It just gives you a super-powered A attack that can break hits multiple tiles at once and can break walls for the duration of the Mega Evolution before you go berserk. 

Also, evolving also increases the amount of EXP needed to level-up, so it just makes it harder to grind as a whole...

The roles are switched. Hydreigon sent you and the other humans to rule and destroy the world for him, hearing many tales of how violent and powerful humans can become, and contacts the most evil and cunning humans he can find to help him. All the friends and allies you make in the game want to/are corrupted into joining you in your quest for destruction. Hydreigon is a bloodthirsty monster and Munna and her gang were just trying to do what's right. 

Munna manages to interfere with Hydreigon's message to the protagonist at the beginning of the game for a split second, cutting him off so the two don't ally with and find each other right away. She knows full well that the two of them together would mean the end of everything, and so Hydreigon chased her down.

You wake up, wondering what happened... But immediately realize that, with the powers of a Pokémon, you can do anything your heart desires. After gathering a following of loyal henchmen (everyone in Post Town/Paradise, your partner, plus Dunsparce/Emolga/Virizion/Umbreon/Espeon), you and your team search for a suitable living space from which they will rule. They plan on taking over the Glacier Palace, as suggested by Umbreon and Espeon, but Kyurem manages to stop them, desperately bribing them to leave by giving him many of his possessions. Your teammates have fallen unconscious thanks to frostbite and possible hypothermia, and while you seem to be used to this type of weather, you decide to take Kyurem's offer to leave on a whim, savoring the fact that you had managed to so-easily bring a legendary Pokémon to his knees.

Since the protagonist doesn't know who Munna is and what her true intentions are, she manages to trick him in his dreams and leads him and his friends into coming to the Forest of Shadows so she, too, can aid them in the world's destruction.

But then the tables are turned and Munna surrounds them with a bunch of other good-willed Pokémon ready to stop you from causing any more harm and forcing others into your cause.

Failed attempt after failed attempt later, Munna's gang continue to fail to successfully stop your brutal rampage, even after capturing your partner and trying to make him see the light. Unfortunately for them, your partner is too far gone and brainwashed to join any side other than your own.

Hydreigon (an enemy Munna and her gang know for a fact they can't beat alone) himself emerges from the shadows to at last meet the human who has impressed him the most out of the other runts in the litter who failed.

Munna's prediction about the protagonist and Hydreigon being unstoppable together came true. And having your partner involved only makes for a tragic turn for the worse.

Hydreigon still explains why you were sent to this world, but also explains that their reign over it was unfortunately put in check by Munna's trump card: Kyurem's snow cone machine, hidden in the back room of his Glacier Palace.

With Kyurem having ridiculous taste in desserts, his snow cones are unbelievably bitter--and so cold, in fact, that the areas near the machine are near-inhospitable for most normal Pokémon, with temperatures so low that even the hottest of of Fire-types would freeze to death if they got too close. This would explain why the protagonist's teammates collapsed from the cold near the end of the palace when they were doing fine the rest of the trip prior.

The protagonist didn't mind the cold anywhere near as much, because it suited a heartless monster like him. And that was why Hydreigon handpicked all of these humans to help--he had hoped someone like the protagonist would make himself known, delighting in the fact that he had managed to find a human worthy of entertaining him and matching his level of irredeemable wickedness.

With that explanation out of the way, Hydreigon, the protagonist, and his partner continue to try to find their way back to Post Town to reconvene with their minions, but are interrupted when Kyurem, ashamed of his fear and desperation from before, works up the courage to find them to try to take down this menace himself.

He manages to kill Hydreigon, and attempts to do the same to you, only to be interrupted by your partner, who jumps in the way. Your partner, who really did see the protagonist as a good friend, bursts into tears, pleading for Kyurem to stop.

Kyurem, taking pity on the child, decides to leave the protagonist battered as he is, hoping the protagonist changes his ways after the beating he just endured, especially now that the source of all this evil--Hydreigon--was taken care of. He warns the partner not to continue their reign of destruction again, or he *will* kill them both.

He leaves, but unluckily for him, Hydreigon is still alive. Having underestimated Kyurem's power, after the protagonists' cohorts find him and return him home, Hydreigon suggests that they avoid the Glacier Palace from now on and stay out of Kyurem's way. The protagonist then calls Hydreigon a disgustingly weak coward, casting him aside, and, enraged at having lost to Kyurem, convinces everyone--both his cohorts and the entirety of Paradise and Post Town--to spread the word of his and his cohorts' second assault on the Glacier Palace to claim it for themselves once and for all.

Word eventually spreads to Kyurem and Munna themselves, and once the protagonists and the others arrive at their doorstep, he does everything in his power to keep them away from him, turning up his snow cone machine to max power, causing the palace to rise and having its brain-freezing properties increase.

On the way up, the protagonists' cohorts--Virizion, Emolga, Umbreon, and Espeon--begin to question whether they should continue to follow the protagonists' leadership, wondering if they will just get discarded as easily as Hydreigon was. 

Umbreon and Espeon discover Keldeo, who was originally captured by Hydreigon. Keldeo was a part of Munna's gang, but was pulled into a scuffle in the Glacier Palace and was never seen since.

Keldeo informs them that Hydreigon had just moved him back to this specific location in the Glacier Palace moments ago, knowing Umbreon and Espeon would find him, hoping the protagonist wouldn't be there with the two of them. Keldeo would attempt to convince Umbreon and Espeon to cease helping the protagonist, telling them what Hydreigon had told him: that Hydreigon had admitted he was wrong in trying to torment the world, and if left unchecked, the protagonist will go much farther than Hydreigon had anticipated, and will kill everything--even Hydreigon himself and the rest of his pawns--if he takes control of the Glacier Palace. 

Once Munna is defeated, she begins to lose hope and is eventually forced to submit to the protagonist's will by your partner--even when Keldeo, Umbreon, and Espeon arrive after the fight to convince her otherwise. Munna even saves the protagonist and partner from a falling icicle, lamenting her new fate.

Kyurem eventually falls as well--not just to the protagonist's and partner's strength--but to his own diabetes, thanks to his diet of nothing but snow cones. He eventually begins to reach his death, and the partner starts to fall from the intense cold that his snow cone machine exudes ahead.

The protagonist's dark power begins to rise, filling the snow cone machine's room with his own evil energy, his takeover of the Glacier Palace commencing. The room takes on a purple, shadowy aura that even begins to spread outside of the Glacier Palace.

Off-screen, Arceus informs Hydreigon that he will destroy the Glacier Palace from above to prevent the protagonist from ascending, but only if Hydreigon tries to make amends by preparing to fly as many Pokémon outside of the palace as he can while it collapses. Unfortunately, Kyurem had passed away before Hydreigon could even attempt to do so, letting out one final roar before disappearing into the after life, and Munna and her gang could not be saved in time.

It is because of Hydreigon's last-minute turn-around act of kindness that Arceus acts out a miracle that momentarily cancels out the protagonist's dark energy (much like how he briefly prevented Grovyle and the Pokémon of the future from disappearing in Sky), and makes the palace collapse in on itself in an attempt to finally take the protagonist's life along with it.

However, the protagonist and partner survive, merely unconscious from the fall. Kyurem's spirit enters their psyche and takes advantage of his now-deceased form to erase their memories to become the main characters they were supposed to be...because surely if an fall of that magnitude couldn't kill them, nothing could. This was the best alternative approach he could think of. He also erases everyone else's memories, with the help of Hydreigon as well, so everyone would forget this horror ever happened, rearranging everyone's memories into thinking the events of the original game happened instead.

The rest of the game happens as originally written (for the most part), but Hydreigon then appears to send the protagonist back to the human world, not wanting to risk his memories returning to him. As he flies him back up, he explains what Arceus had told him and what they did to prevent the protagonist's reign of terror.

Remembering his loss, the protagonist cries out, bawling in defeat, trapped in his yellow bubble as he flies back home, traumatized by his failure to take over this world.

In the post-game, your partner somehow retains his memories and tries to bring the protagonist back, with Hydreigon desperately trying to convince him not to do so to the best of his ability, but fails. The Worldcore is comprised of the spirits of Munna and her gang, who try to aid Hydreigon in stopping this catastrophe, but fail as well. The protagonist returns, and the Pokémon world is brought to ruin.

438,"There's nothing wrong with that... But I figured most answers would be more general to make the game better overall for more people rather than more personal. After all, the game's for everyone.

I was personally okay with PSMD's recruitment system, for example, but a lot of people here have given valid arguments as to why they don't like it and prefer the old, RNG-based recruitment system every game prior had. And a lot of people are agreeing.

The developers of Super listened to all the complaints everyone had about Gates and fixed them. The Quiz is back and gives you the option to choose so you avoid constantly resetting, Hunger's back, all Pokémon in the National Dex (at the time) were added, the game was more of a challenge to complete, you didn't have to sit and watch all of your teammates level up and learn a ton of new moves the second you enter a dungeon just because they've been relying on the Exp. Share for too long anymore, etc. etc. A lot of these changes made the game objectively better from a gameplay standpoint and appealed to a lot more people. 

The quiz even had a valid reason for existing this time, unlike in Explorers--the Pokémon you learn who was asking the questions is just silly enough to be the type to ask these types of questions when it comes to determining what new Pokémon you'll be.

If everyone demands a ""character like them"", that's not exactly something the developers can really do for everyone... And of course they can't make everyone happy, but Super was a solid attempt at getting the vast majority of the fanbase back (and several newcomers to the series).

If the next PMD game's protagonist *does* end up being a lot like the one from Gates, great. If not, oh well. Maybe they'll bring a totally new personality to the table. Even after four games in the series, PMD still manages to surprise me.",2016-05-20 17:23:14+00:00,d3d5g19,6.0,t1_d3csrhb,20052.0,MysteryDungeon
439,"Bingoned20 has a point. I think you're mainly speaking for yourself here. Not everyone relates to the Gates protagonist. Sure, he had the most personality and speaking lines, and was vague enough for most people to project themselves onto, but he was still nowhere near flawless as a non-silent projectable main character everyone can relate to.

Super's protagonist I related to slightly more because he was both somewhat snarky and mainly kept to himself, watching others interact rather than interact himself either because he couldn't or didn't feel he should.

It's all subjective. A little too subjective to just demand a ""character that feels like you"", because everyone's different.

That's why every protagonist in the main series games is mute. Red, Gold/Ethan, Brendan, etc... So you could more easily project any personality onto them. Same with Link in the Zelda games (though Link is slowly starting to develop his own personality and emotions because of fan demand).",2016-05-20 09:35:30+00:00,d3cqa0h,4.0,t1_d3au3zh,127109.0,MysteryDungeon

442,"Oooh, comparing all the spooky tracks, huh? Let's see... I'm no aficionado on music theory or sound design, but I do have my preferences! I'm going to rank these from least favorite to most favorite, but I don't dislike any of these tracks in the slightest.

""Hiding in the Shadows"" feels to be the shortest and most repetitive of the bunch. But I guess it's justified considering it only plays once in the whole game, and for just a small amount of time greater than the looping point of this track. It's creepy, sure, and it does have a bit of a double-meaning in its creepiness by both tricking you into thinking Hydreigon's lurking, when in reality, it's Munna and her gang... And the reverb does complement the area you're in...but it's my least favorite of the bunch.

""Fear (Unused)"" is nice. It's a great set-up for the beginning of ""Battle with Kyurem"", or just Kyurem as a whole. It's a shame it never plays in the game, but I can't really think of a good place for it to. I prefer the total silence before Kyurem's surprise attack at the end of the Scorching Desert. 

As for the Super tracks... I'm going to include ""Pale Flame"" in this just for the sake of it. It shares the same tone as the rest of these cutscene tracks, so I might as well, even if it isn't a ""FUON"" track.

Now's when it gets tricky. ""On Patrol at the School"", ""So Hot..."", ""Terrifying Shadow"", and ""Pale Flame"" all complement and build up to each other in that order. ""Patrol"" sets up the general unease of the situation, ""So Hot"" establishes something unsettling is afoot, ""Terrifying Shadow"" is the payoff where said unease builds up into everything goes wrong and the suspense of the unknown reaches a climax, and ""Pale Flame"" would represent the aftermath, the falling action when one would try to rationalize what just happened or would try to act accordingly with knowledge about said climax.

I rank them as ""Patrol""&lt;""Terrifying Shadow""&lt;""So Hot""&lt;""Pale Flame"". 

The first two are a bit repetitive and simplistic, while ""Pale Flame"" takes things a small step further by adding onto the track with that beat(?) 9 seconds and the strings 29 seconds in to make it feel less repetitive, adding onto the feeling of unease it's meant to convey. The immediate jump back to silence at the end of the looping point was nice, too, 48 seconds in. As if you began to feel something looking over your shoulder, too scared to confirm your fears or not as it creeps closer, but once you finally work up the courage to look behind you, it's suddenly gone. But since it isn't one of the ""FUON"" tracks, it technically doesn't count.

So I like ""So Hot"" for a lot of the same reasons as you do!",2016-05-19 20:21:29+00:00,d3c24jl,1.0,t3_4jj0zp,326842.0,MysteryDungeon

445,"Hmm... Now that I think about it, maybe the ""footrunes"" in Explorers and the ""ancient foot-shaped writing"" in Super are two completely different things?

Since Super tends on insist on using that much longer title, I'm now starting to think that this is the game's way of trying to differentiate two separate foot-related writings. Either that, or it's another mistranslation/purposeful change from the previous game.

Though the former explanation makes more sense in trying to justify all of these games happening within the same lifetime.

Pokémon still tend to write with their feet to this day in Super, though--Goomy's handwriting was ""sloppy"", for example, because he's a slug and had to write his name on the tarp in Foreboding Forest by slithering on it. And I'm sure Pokémon like Deerling and Shelmet have to do the same with *their* feet, considering their lack of limbs. So maybe Pokémon of the modern day *all* write with their feet/footprints to keep things consistent for every species?

Meaning the footrunes in Explorers aren't exactly ancient while the ones in Super *are*.",2016-05-18 00:54:53+00:00,d39lkbj,2.0,t1_d39k9y5,1659.0,MysteryDungeon
446,"To be fair, Super added all the Pokémon in response to all the people complaining that there were only 150+ available in Gates, which focused solely on the story and world. Sure, there were other gameplay elements Gates changed and added that weren't very good, either, but the lack of every Pokémon from the current National Dex at the time was what got the most people mad for some reason.

I personally didn't mind it very much--because really, who uses more than like, 10 Pokémon out of the hundreds there are in the world in a game like this?--especially when the PMD games force you to use your hero and partner for most story dungeons, and force you to grind up for hours if you ever want to use anyone other than them. 

Super responded to this by making models for all 720 Pokémon, adding the Motivated feature, having Pokémon take breaks, and having EXP shared for all Pokémon, even ones that didn't go on expeditions in a dungeon (and though shared EXP was a trend Gates started, it was improved in Super). That way people would actually want to *use* a lot more of the Pokémon they painstakingly programmed. 

And that's why Super had the changed recruitment system. Everyone wanted the choice to recruit all 720 Pokémon and they got it. From their perspective, I can understand why they'd force us to use more than just a select few of them.

And because of fan demand, it looks like they'll be forced to add every single National Dex Pokémon for every future PMD game from now on. Kind of a shame, having to reprogram Pokémon like Tranquill, Finneon, and any of the Unown, knowing no one's really going to use them even though a lot of people demanded that *every* Pokémon should be in *every* PMD game.

I'm glad Super still had a decent story regardless, though.",2016-05-17 04:20:43+00:00,d38fh8y,2.0,t1_d38bue1,6254.0,MysteryDungeon
447,"Every starter Pokémon available in Super (and their evolutions)--except for character cameos like Charizard, Blastoise, and Grovyle, who were in past games and are obtained through actual missions--can be recruited simply by talking to them in the overworld. 

So Piplup and Servine should just be standing in place at one of the towns or continents in the world. They, like the other starters and other wandering NPCs, appear and disappear at random. Doing different missions and revisiting every area every in-game day should help. If they have a red exclamation mark and speech bubble on their heads, they should want to join your team.

I got Piplup and Servine well before I even got 700 connections myself, so I'm sure it's just random chance that they'd appear and want to join your team.

I'm going to be honest, I don't know why you were banned and muted - I'm not going to remove the ban since it's only 7 days and I'm not going to undermine another mod's decision, but I apologize for that on their behalf. I'm pretty sure they were likely stressed out from all the spam today and you just were on the receiving end of it.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, maybe you disagree with ""low-effort"" posts being removed, which is fine, but these are rules the community voted on. The subreddit used to be much less strict and believe me it was much worse. Memes all over the front page, screenshots of totally hilarious dialogue from the games that you couldn't have missed if you just played the game, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; We can't make exceptions to the rule because people liked the post - Then other people will break the same rule and point to yours saying ""But this was okay, why isn't mine?""
&gt; 
&gt; The spam of artwork and spoiler tags is ridiculous, I agree. However, these are things the community votes on - Don't just blame the mods. I approve plenty of discussion threads, polls, etc. and they all get downvoted buried by artwork. If a post doesn't get a spoiler tag, it gets dozens of reports yelling ""SPOILERS SPOILERS MODS PLS""

&gt;Thanks for being understanding. I know we're still far from perfect, but me and the other mods really do try our best to make it a good sub so it kinda hurts when I see comments like ""yeah, fuck /r/pokemon""

463,"I agree. Ever since episode 1 of XY, they've really done their best justify Ash's battle style as him ""thinking outside the box"" and him ""doing something clever that most other Trainers wouldn't do"" whenever he does something that would usually make fans mad, like pitting one of his Pokémon against another with a type disadvantage.

The animation has also gotten LEAGUES better, too. The animation quality for the anime has started out ""just about average"" to ""pretty good"" at best from the start, and it just sort of...stayed that way. Until XY came and gave every battle movie-level quality animation. Even at XY's worst, its animation is still much better than anything any season prior could make.

I may have only watched every episode up until he beat Korrina, but I have seen a few episodes here and there after when I decided to just watch whatever happened to be on if I was up early enough on a Saturday. I managed to see Ash's battle with Clemont, as well as a couple revolving around Valerie's arc. I think I saw one involving Serena's goal, too, with (I think) either a role model or rival of hers?

468,"I honestly felt the strongest connection with Super's main cast and hub than I did with any of the other games (early on, at least; not when I put the entire game into perspective, of course). It all felt justified and didn't feel rushed or shoved in there in any way. After all, the Serene Village section took up *half* the game--they definitely took their time putting you through this.

Every character had personality, you got time to know each and every one of them, and it not only did the three things you mentioned in the original post, but it also foreshadowed a lot of what would happen in the second half of the story. All of that set-up definitely made me like the second half of the game more than I normally would have, and made me find it less rushed than some people make it out to be.

And, you know, even with the Serene Village section being as long with it was, I still wish there was a bit more of it. I wish we had more interactions with Carracosta and some of his friends, a little more of him and his chemistry with Nuzleaf playing good-cop/bad-cop, and giving other characters like Deerling and Simipour a spotlight since they did the least overall, despite being introduced to them early on and given the impression they would be relevant.

I wish Watchog had some proper development, too, but his conflict with the partner was mainly played up for laughs. I feel he had the potential for just a tiny revelation before jumping to the conclusion he makes in his letter. He also has the most heartwarming post-game dialogue out of all the school staff.

People often rag on PSMD's first half to be slow and uneventful, but really, you could say that about any PMD game--I've seen recent newcomers to the series say Explorers' first half was slow and uneventful until *after* the Fogbound Lake expedition when you meet Dusknoir. The same could be said for Rescue Team until you enter the Great Canyon, or Gates to Infinity until during or after your expedition to the Great Glacier for the first time.

Every PMD game's first half or so is spent world-building and establishing its cast of characters. What really matters is how effectively it manages to do so, or how much you enjoyed playing through it.

What I disliked most about the first half of Super's story was that, as 1stJusticebringer said, only very few of the characters you meet *stay* relevant after the first half of the story. All but one of the school kids, all of the school staff, all of the other residents of the village... Even Carracosta is left behind, and none of them play a part in the rest of the story.

But it's not much better than having most of Rescue Team's or Explorers' first few arcs be completely stand-alone one-offs as well. Caterpie and Metapod, the Magnemite, the Jumpluff, Spoink, and Azurill and Marill, for example, had nothing to do with the overall story. (Except for when Azurill and Marill played a part in the post-game, but I'm talking solely about the main story).",2016-05-14 15:46:26+00:00,d35bpz0,1.0,t3_4jafji,31796.0,MysteryDungeon

470,"They both have different level-up movesets. Cyndaquil gets Smokescreen and Flame Wheel, for example, while Charmander only gets Smokescreen. Charmander also eventually evolves into Charizard, a Fire/Flying type, and gets access to some Flying-type and Dragon-type moves. Cyndaquil later evolves into Typhlosion and stays a pure Fire-type. 

But you won't be able to evolve until the post-game, so it's a moot point. I would say Cyndaquil would be easier to use, because Smokescreen is extremely OP in Rescue Team and Explorers, especially against bosses.

In Super Mystery Dungeon, however, Smokescreen is still effective but nowhere near as OP as it was in Rescue Team and Explorers. Charmander is the easier choice in this game because of its quick access to Dragon Rage and Flame Burst, both of which are extremely powerful moves to have early on in the story.

Long-term, in any PMD game, Charizard eventually gets access to Heat Wave, a strong move that hits every Pokémon in a single room. Typhlosion later gets Lava Plume, which hits all Pokémon surrounding you within a 1-tile radius. Both moves can be useful in certain situations, but most prefer Heat Wave.

... But I also think Cyndaquil's character portraits are cuter than Charmander's. And I loved playing as one in Explorers of Darkness when I was a kid. The game is still more than beatable no matter what starter you pick, so it's up to you.",2016-05-14 05:26:19+00:00,d34zcvi,1.0,t3_4ja6us,425.0,MysteryDungeon

And since this Jirachi is the same one from Explorers (and even mentions Star Cave),"")  it's best to take his word over Pancham's.

472,"Plus, the games sort of justify the world changing drastically like this in such a short amount of time; every game says Mystery Dungeons change every time you enter them, but maybe that doesn't just apply with the dungeon's floor layout and items. 

Since Mystery Dungeons only seem to appear or change whenever some sort of catastrophe is underfoot (natural disasters, time stopping, Pokémon turning to stone), it'd only make sense for some to change aesthetically and floor-wise overtime, too (like what happened with some of the dungeons in the Explorers games, having some of them be altered and act much differently in the dark future than they do in the past). 

So that's why I like the fact that they didn't just reuse the exact same dungeon names and themes, and kept the references more subtle. It gives you room to imagine what could've happened to some of these past dungeons and why certain Pokémon moved to where they were.

For example, since the Lake Guardians don't exactly have Time Gears to guard anymore, since they're all back at Temporal Tower, I figured they decided to find new places of residence, and scattered throughout different Continents instead of living on the same one at once. And besides, Fogbound Lake didn't seem like it was going to remain fixated in place for much longer anyway--with how Steam Cave was barely holding the place up in the first place. Maybe it finally tipped over and Mesprit took advantage of that to change the scenery.

Same with Kyurem doing some home-searching and redecorating after the Glacier Palace was destroyed. 

It would also explain why so many Pokémon feel the need to explore and document the world, since it constantly changes so often. 

Though some old dungeons are implied to still exist, like Star Cave, and the Glacier Palace was referenced in a Jelliecent Show episode.

And with the different towns, I liked the idea of being able to visit more than just the same token towns we've become acquainted with from every game. It really helped expand on the idea of each Continent having multiple towns and villages that we just never get to visit.

But if they're going to be more direct about their cameos and areas, I'd rather have them be at least somewhat relevant to the story, and not feel shoved in there for nostalgia's sake. That was what I was expecting when I bought PSMD, but instead I came out seeing just a bunch of NPCs saying one-liners, and relevant ones giving subtle nods to last games.

Which is fine; while that does help PSMD's story stand out on its own with its own cast of characters, I still wish the cameos did more than just...be there. But I guess they could only do so much with them when they tried to avoid spoiling the other games for new players' sake.",2016-05-13 16:48:32+00:00,d3485g5,3.0,t1_d341kwi,8937.0,MysteryDungeon

476,"The black market is rather dull in the abundance of Pokémon sold in it. There is a reason why most Grunts from every Team use the same generic Pokémon--from Rattata and Koffing in Team Rocket to Glameow and Stunky in Team Galactic. 

Many criminal organizations over the years have become rather gimmicky--almost childish, in a way--with what Pokémon they choose to represent them in battle, picking a sole few over the many hundreds that exist, usually picking sinister-looking Pokémon or Pokémon that match their theme. Teams Magma and Aqua, for example, have the least variety, but take their teams' themes up to 11, choosing to solely use Numel and Koffing, as well as Carvahna and Grimer, respectively.

The fact that every team appears to use so few Pokémon could also be because they may cost the least to steal or buy off and then send to every member.

Though as for Pokémon that are worth the most, it seems Porygon is one species that appears to have gotten quite the attraction from Team Galactic as of late. I recently spoke to a Veilstone resident living near the Galactic HQ who happened to come across a Porygon who had managed to frantically escape the building. No others have been seen since.

As Porygon is a rare species in the wild--and because it is mainly sold as a prize at Game Corners in various regions--it can definitely be inferred that this Pokémon and its evolutions are one of the top bargains at the moment. Especially when Team Galactic themselves seem to be involved with the Veilstone Game Corner itself; their insignia is visible whenever one plays the slots.

True! Really wish Gates took the advantage of its stab at DLC by giving us story-related Special Episodes instead of just extra dungeons that made the overall game easier or gave veteran PMD masochists something to do (along with the occasional rip of music from a past game.

Relating Quagsire to Officer Magnezone and his crew, or showing more of Umbreon and Espeon's relationship and how they met Virizion and/or Keldeo, for example, in said episodes you mentioned would not only add more depth to the characters, but make them feel more like a part of the PMD world. Out of all the other games, I felt Gates was the most disconnected from the other three, mainly because it literally had no nods to the previous games, no matter how subtle--which is fine, considering it was a stand-alone story to begin with--but I just liked how Rescue Team and Explorers kind of went back and forth between making really subtle and ambiguous nods towards each other, despite being stand-alone stories as well.

&gt; the good deeds are stronger than the bad and so nobody minds a slight misfortune in exchange for a greater benefit.

As for the Litwick... As adorable as those acts of kindness were, it did kind of contradict what the partner allowed them to do.

482,"Most PMD bosses are either **""GRRR I'M A VICIOUS OUTLAW/VILLAIN JUST TRY AND STOP ME BWAHAHAHA""** or **""WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE GET OUT""** so it can be hard to pick which bosses stand out on their own, since a lot of them act the same way. Armaldo even makes fun of this in Special Episode 2.

**Rescue Team:**

I guess I'd say Team Meanies would be my favorite boss to fight out of all the games; not only are they the only non-final boss to have own unique encounter/battle theme, but I always liked the idea of having a rival team that would get in your way and build tension that would build up in a fight like the one they started in Sinister Woods. Sorta wish it had a tiny bit more build-up to it, though. Getting to kick Gengar's ass sometime *after* the Fugitive arc would've been more satisfying, for example, but I guess they wanted to establish as early on as they could that Team Meanies are just a pack of weaklings.

I just find it weird how quickly they went from 0-to-100 when they handled their plans, and how causal they were about it. They go from stealing your mail and doing mundane, ridiculous acts that were only mischievous at best, to practically *taking over the entire town* and convincing everyone to *kill you*! And in such a short amount of time, too. Yeesh. I could never tell whether I should take them seriously or if I should take their threats for granted...and that they probably just happened to get lucky when Gengar happened to overhear what went down with Xatu. [](#H5)

**Explorers:**

Fighting the ""Grand Master of All Things Bad"" and his ""minions"" was really fun. It definitely wasn't something I expected or an arc I expected to go through because it only really happened just this once in this game and nowhere else. The silly music playing after the intense cutscene track playing before it, how challenging the fight could be if you were hit by an Earth Power or if you got surrounded, how determined everyone was to keep the act up... It was great. And it was nice getting to surpass the Pokémon you looked up to and worked alongside with throughout the entire main story. [](#D1)

**Gates:**

The fight with Munna and the last chunk of her gang was pretty climactic. It had plenty of build-up and is known to be one of the more difficult, if not *the* most difficult, boss fight of the game. I like how they also all utilize Team Skills in your fight against them, making them seem less like dumbed-down enemy Pokémon and more like equals--two separate teams using everything in your power to beat the other, following different beliefs.

I still wish Munna elaborated on her backstory and wasn't so vague about it. Everyone else got one; why didn't she? She's pretty much the main villain. Even Kyurem got a backstory on why he started this intricate plan in the first place, and Munna did more than he did throughout the course of the game. And Munna switching sides as quickly as she did was a tiny bit rushed, but oh well. [](#I5)

**Super:**

PSMD had amazing bosses. At least when it came to comedic timing and chemistry together. The nervous and weak-willed Drilbur group led by the more serious, aggressive Gabite; the easily-angered Beedrill with the cute-but-apparently-ferocious Combee; the rough-and-tough dick-measuring Poliwrath brothers who were so full of themselves that they only had one adorable Poliwag lackey... Not to mention the Litwick gang and their plans overall. So much juxtaposition with such weirdly detailed story arcs, taking the usual PMD story tropes and making them stand out more.

It definitely brought more personality and character to its bosses than all the other games did. Overall, at least.

But I'd say my favorite would have to be...Entei. I *loved* seeing a legendary Pokémon take action in the plot, and not acting as some normal Pokémon who did nothing to help stop whatever was happening to the world. The three-part boss gauntlet was great, too, making you fight Magmortar and the Magmar to wear you down, expecting you to be blown back by Entei's first phase. It provided the perfect premise and build-up for the unexpected Harmony Scarf twist. [](#K4)",2016-05-10 23:07:06+00:00,d30lg4i,1.0,t3_4irvxo,1450.0,MysteryDungeon

I was never good with team names... [](#G5)

While I don't remember the team names I gave my Pokémon in my copies of Blue Rescue Team and Explorers of Darkness, the earliest one I can remember is calling my team in Sky ""Team Aura"", comprised of a Riolu and Pikachu, named as such for obvious reasons. [](#A2)[](#A3)

In Gates, I expected my team to be called ""Team Paradise"" (also for obvious reasons), but when I saw the game treat team names like they do in real life and not like past PMD games, it felt awkward having other NPCs refer to us as ""the Paradise""... So I changed it, making us ""the Dank Memers"". 2013 was a weird year for me. [](#C4)

Then Super came out and followed the same rules Gates did when it came to how it referred to its teams. I just called us ""the Serene"" to represent the protagonist's and partner's hometown. [](#E2)[](#B4)

**Locations:**

As for my favorite location, the Tree of Life would have to be my favorite dungeon just from the scenery and music alone (both before and after it was taken over by Dark Matter). I just wish it had more floors. Though if I had to settle down somewhere, I'd love to live in Treasure Town! That upbeat music, the Spinda Café, the perfect climate and weather, protection from Wigglytuff's Guild if there are criminals about, not to mention getting to live near a beach and hot springs! And Sharpedo Bluff makes for a great hangout spot! It just feels like the perfect place to live. [](#K5)

**Songs:**

And for my favorite song... That changes constantly. And with Super out, nowadays it's hard for me to choose out of all the tracks from all four games. But I guess the closest thing to a favorite I had was Barren Valley. I would listen to it before school on the Sky Jukebox all the time back in 2009. That and all the other SE5 tracks in accordance to whatever weekday it was, but I always liked Barren Valley a bit more. It's such an underrated track overshadowed by the final dungeon tracks or emotional ""feelsy"" tracks that everyone loves. It described Grovyle's dark future and his resolve perfectly, in my opinion. [](#C1)

**Liked Most from Favorite Game:**

Ahh, and I never was really able to pick favorites for any of the games themselves, either! Rescue Team has a lot of nostalgia bias that makes me still love it (though I still try to defend it and criticize it as objectively as I can), Explorers set the standard for every future PMD game, Gates had a well-rounded case of characters and a short-but-sweet main story (as well as a bunch of hit-and-miss gameplay features), and Super took a little of everything great from all the previous games while expanding on them greatly and putting its own spin on them. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, but I'm grateful I got to play each and every one of them. ♥ [](#J4)

But I'd say the soundtrack is what I like the most out of any PMD game. That, and a decent, coherent story, with good character interactions. Which is what every PMD game has (at least to some extent), but I'd say Gates and Super managed to refine all of this a tiny bit more than Rescue Team and Explorers did. Just a tiny bit.

Otherwise the Pokémon in later games seem to just treat it like it's not that big a deal after their initial shock (though in Super it's played for laughs, with Jirachi knowing how this works by now and the rest of the Expedition Society being a pack off goofballs who just didn't really care).",2016-05-08 05:34:02+00:00,d2x5prh,2.0,t1_d2wzsck,12865.0,MysteryDungeon

It would've been much better to just stick with what Super already had going by having either silence or ambience playing before you enter Roots.

It doesn't matter what age you are or how long it's been since you've remembered or done something. You can feel nostalgic for anything, really. I already feel nostalgic for Super Mystery Dungeon... The months I spent being hyped for it, the night I bought it after a long day of class when it came out on November 20th, the free time I earned getting to play through the story for the first time... It was great.

I'm nostalgic for all the other PMD games, too, of course, and the other memories I remember associated with those, as well. You should try those out sometime, though the lower-quality soundfonts and gameplay features might be a bit jarring for you, considering you started with the 3D games first.

I'd say you shouldn't hope to feel nostalgic for something, though. Some of the greatest moments most people remember in life are the ones they don't expect too much out of.

506,"It all comes down to personal taste for some. Not many people play these games knowing very much about music theory or sound design, so remixers who want to know the general public's opinion on certain tracks may get a lot of general, oversimplified, overly-subjective answers. I try my best not to fall into that category, and I've see a few others on here try to do the same by talking about the music's place in the plot and how that reflects the story, characters, and setting it revolves around, but my own lack of knowledge on music theory and sound design is definitely going to show at some point no matter how much I agree or disagree with you on anything regarding this topic, so it's not like I or many other can argue or ""fite"" against you when discussing which tracks are objectively better than others.

So if you don't like Sky Tower, that's fine. Other people's differing tastes in games, music, whatever don't bother me at the end of the day. It's just fun to discuss here, especially when this specific subreddit was meant for this kind of thing. 

I (and a lot of other people, judging from standard YouTube comments), liked Sky Tower because of the context the theme played when we were all immersed in the story (most likely as children). A lot of us also have at least a twinge of nostalgia bias listening to it now that we're all older. It was intense, somewhat whimsical, and its instrumentation befitted the dungeon's setting, way up in the clouds, but I guess that would be hard to convey for someone who didn't grow up with the games themselves nor ever had to deal with listening or adjusting to lower-quality soundfonts at all in their life. 

I guess asking someone to fite you on whether Sky Tower was a good track or not could work better for the many other remixers on YouTube and SoundCloud who rearranged the track and said they loved it from the start. Not someone like me.

As for my opinion on Gates's final dungeon tracks... I like Western Spire and Eastern Spire. I like the recurring ""Despair"" motif that plays for those two, fitting the situation and the antagonists. The differing genres also made them stand out and made them feel more unique, but I like Great Spire more because it combines both the ""Despair"" and ""Hope"" motifs together at the same time to show the resolve of both the protagonists and the antagonists in one bombastic, epic piece just oozing with finality as you slowly struggle your way over to your final battle with Kyurem, struggling to breathe as you head closer to the Bittercold as well.

Great Spire just feels like a very satisfying payoff to the build-up Western Spire and Eastern Spire provided, and that's why I like it more.",2016-05-01 01:20:10+00:00,d2nybh8,,t1_d2kl1oa,,MysteryDungeon

508,"Gotta agree with the comments saying Dusknoir's betrayal was the most obvious in the series. Munna's and Nuzleaf's were much more unexpected, in my opinion. 

With Munna, there was only one or two tiny, glossed-over hints that seemed to show her true intentions, but all in all, her betrayal was *meant* to be out-of-nowhere, and it worked. I don't know a single blind player who wasn't at least somewhat caught off guard by her betrayal.

And with Nuzleaf, his hints were some of the most subtle and cleverly foreshadowed in the whole series. I liked all the little details they added that made him seem somewhat shady while still making him look as friendly as possible. Nowhere near as obvious as Dusknoir's, and more well-written, at that.

I like Dusknoir more as a character, but when it comes to his plot twist, even if he *was* the first Pokémon to start the whole ""betrayal"" trope that the later games followed, his betrayal was easy to see coming, even on my first run of the game years ago as a kid. Mr. ""Hoo-Hoo-Hah Faintest-of-Smiles Sinister-Looking Ghost-type McGee"" just didn't do a good job at making himself look like a good guy, but his character development and depth in Special Episode 5 was amazing.

Though, heck, if anything, Rescue Team had a betrayal as well--by having the entirety of Pokémon Square track you down and kill you instead of a singular Pokémon--thanks to Gengar's tricks and the towns-Pokémon's fickle attitudes. So Dusknoir wasn't even the first to start this trope... Albeit it was the towns-Pokémon chasing you that were tricked and not you, but still.

And sure, the constant betrayals might make the games' plot more predictable and formulaic, but I personally like how the writers are taking advantage of already-used PMD tropes and using them in ways we wouldn't expect, making them better and better with installment.

The main series games end up doing the same thing, too. Eight Gyms, at least one rival, new Pokémon, at least one professor, at least one evil team, Pokémon League, done. But now the newer installments try to add a little more to that by adding and expanding on bits of lore and character development to make something what most find overdone into something more fresh.

Yes, PMD was a more story-driven game than the main series games to begin with, and while I would like it if the writers used new tropes and story elements, it would only benefit them if they executed them *well.* Having newer tropes be executed *badly* doesn't make the story better to me, so it's a slippery slope the writers have to cross. 

Super definitely took several steps to deviate from the norm already--starting off in medias res with meeting Nuzleaf and the Beheeyem from the start instead of your partner, making friends with your partner gradually and not within the first ten minutes of the game, having your partner disappear at the end instead of you, having non-Pokémon entities play a *large* role in the plot (though Gates did that as well), adding the school-related portions of the game and multiple hubs rather than just *one* town you're stuck in the *entire* game, etc. etc. The entire recruitment system was changed, too, with the Connection Orb, and the addition of newer Seeds, newer Orbs, Gold Bars, and Wands overtime add new layers of depth to the gameplay with each installment.

Though I'm not sure where else they could go with the series past Super. I read an article somewhere saying Spike Chunsoft isn't sure themselves, either. Especially since the *entire* world is already documented on a map now, so there aren't many possibilities left to explore the world now, and Super's climax was about as big and high-stakes as you can get for a Pokémon game...",2016-04-30 22:42:04+00:00,d2nt0d7,1.0,t3_4h5z6w,9210.0,MysteryDungeon

510,"The earlier PMD games have a pretty wide range of levels you can beat the main story at, because they gave you a ton of freedom to grind whenever and practically wherever you wanted. With all the missions you could do in between (and during) story events, the ability to use the Makuhita Dojo/Marowak Dojo without wasting an in-game day, and getting to level up and stock up on items at ""rest stop"" dungeons like the Rock Path and Snow Path really helped determine how much easier you wanted to make the game for yourself.

People often beat Rescue Team, on average, between levels 26-39. And people often beat the Explorers games, on average, between levels 34-48.

But just a warning, Rescue Team's post-game is tough. Much tougher than a lot of the other PMD games' post-game. It gives you a pretty steep learning curve the moment you start it up. Traps, 99F dungeons, Keys, HM requirements, forced Quicksaves, high-level Pokémon and bosses, recruitment treasures... It's a lot to take in all at once if you're new to the series.

The other games luckily learned from this and introduced a lot of these types of things much earlier on and at a more fair, gradual pace, but you might end up having a tough time with some of the post-game dungeons at the level you're at.",2016-04-30 05:04:26+00:00,d2n1ftb,1.0,t3_4h2nfm,11406.0,MysteryDungeon

513,"I wouldn't say Trunk subverts past PMD tropes and motifs by not being bombastic and epic. In fact, both Roots and Trunk together copy the same strategy used for Sky Tower and Temporal Tower--having the first half of the dungeon sound loud and grand, and having the latter half sound more ambient and atmospheric (or at least somewhat calmer). 

Sky Tower and Sky Tower Summit, along with Temporal Tower and Temporal Spire mesh with each other with the same synergy that Tree of Life: Roots and Tree of Life: Trunk do on your way to your final battle.

Gates is the only one that breaks this trend, having Glacier Palace be separated into three parts rather than two, with multiple boss battles, and the last theme being the one that sounds bombastic and epic compared to its previous two parts instead of the other way around.

Though to answer the post's question, I don't have a favorite Tree of Life theme. I like both Roots and Trunk equally. It's hard for me to like just one when I know the context and message the other track is trying to show, so I like them both as a result.

Trunk represents your initial stride up the tree, confident and determined you'll make it back successful, while Roots is more reflective and more focused on the stakes at hand as well as the full-on war going on outside.

Both complement each other well in that regard, so I can't choose. They're like yin and yang to me. I feel the same way about Temporal Tower and Temporal Spire, both of which convey the same thing.

520,"Let's see... Back in 2008, my younger brother and I bought both Time and Darkness, respectively. With Darkness, I stayed true to what I got honestly with my first attempt at the quiz yet again, and got a Cyndaquil main with a Piplup partner. I don't remember what my brother got in Time (I think he had a Treecko and somethings else), but I do remember him never finishing the game. He made it to the second-to-last story dungeon and just kind of lost interest after dying so many times, lol. 

Darkness was great. It did everything Rescue Team did but better, so as a sequel, it did its job. I didn't try as hard to 100% the game this time, but I did end pretty high-leveled with a lot of the side dungeons completed. Never even got to the highest rank this time, though.

Then Sky came out in 2009 and made Time/Darkness completely obsolete. Sure, it was better than Time/Darkness by a mile, but... It was the practically the same game for full price, so if you end up having fun with Rescue Team, I suggest skipping straight to Sky, and ignoring Time/Darkness completely.

In Sky, I got a Riolu main and a Pikachu partner. I don't think I ever reset the quiz for a different Pokémon in any of these games, because I remember being pleasantly surprised with getting this pair! Especially when that was the exact same pair that showed up in the ad that aired for the game at the time.

When Gates to Infinity came out, the personality quiz was gone, and I decided to go by what the ads had a second time by having an Oshawott main and a Pikachu partner.

And as for Super Mystery Dungeon... I went back to my roots by following the quiz honestly, no resets. Little did I know that I would get Riolu again, just like I did in Sky! I chose Pikachu as my partner again, and it brought back so many memories.

Though FRLG had nothing from Yellow, by the way. No references to the anime to be found, so they were just based on RGB verbatim. But you're right about ORAS technically being ""unnecessary"" from a gameplay perspective, but you can't just expect every Pokémon player to still have at least one 3rd, 4th, and 5th gen game, with multiple older systems. And even with all of those things, like you said, transferring Pokémon was still a pain. So in that sense, for those players only starting with 6th gen or for those who lack the necessary requirements to properly transfer a 3rd gen Pokémon onward, ORAS helped in that regard.

And it's not like ORAS didn't acknowledge this--it gave players who *were* able to transfer a true 3rd gen Pokémon to ORAS a certificate for doing so.",2016-04-22 18:45:45+00:00,d2de450,6.0,t1_d2d0km1,18817.0,pokemon

As for ORAS, I disagree that we got ""nothing"" from Emerald--the Delta Episode had several references and foreshadowing plot elements talking about it.

FRLG were basically RB near-verbatim, HGSS were GS remastered to fit C in properly, and ORAS made them look more like RS1.5, somewhere in between what FRLG and HGSS did to the older games.",2016-04-22 07:50:57+00:00,d2ctjpn,4.0,t1_d2cqgp2,8757.0,pokemon

528,"Glad you started on Rescue Team! It's the best place to start when trying out PMD for the first time, imo. Trying out the later games first just makes it harder to adjust and appreciate the older ones because of the fixed gameplay elements they added later on.

Roguelikes can get pretty unfair or skewed against you--sometimes a lot of aspects are pretty luck-based. Accuracy of moves, complex floor layouts, the type of Pokémon you'll fight in every dungeon, bad item drops, bad luck in recruitment percentage rates, etc.

Rescue Team is one of the hardest PMD games, but it had a lot of broken strategies to take advantage of.

First off, if you or your partner is a Grass-type, you've practically set the game on hard mode. Not that the game's impossible or near-unbeatable with one (I near-100%ed the game with Bulbasaur as my first ever starter when I picked the game up for the first time as a kid, a few months after its release back in 2006), but since every single main story boss (except one, but even then, its dungeon is full of Fire and Poison-types) is super-effective or resistant to Grass-types, you might end up dying more than you normally would if you weren't one.

Regardless of your typing, though, accuracy and linking moves is key. Have a Mudkip? Mud Slap everything until the enemy's accuracy is too low for it to matter. Have a Cyndaquil? Smokescreen everything so you have a few free turns to do your thing until the enemy's Whiffer status wears off (which gives it 0% accuracy for a few turns). Have a Skitty? Sing and Attract.

Type immunities don't exist in Rescue Team and Explorers, so Electric-types can hit Ground-types, Ground-types can hit Flying-types, and so on, but only for a miniscule amount of damage...but if you're strong enough or have a useful-enough move (i.e. Mud Slap on any Pokémon regardless of typing), then it might not matter too much in some situations.

The game gives a few link suggestions in your mailbox at one point.

Linking moves like those with other offensive moves definitely helps you defeat enemies and bosses easier, but if you come across a plateau you can't progress, then try not to lose too many of your items and Poke and restart from the dungeon's entrance from your last save point. This can help you save and conserve your Reviver Seeds, since they seem to be a tiny bit more rare in Rescue Team than in any other game.

If you want to grind, use the Makuhita Dojo while you can--and complete every available dungeon there once you're strong enough to beat it. Doing so at the right time gives you worthwhile EXP.

At one or two points in the story your partner will offer two separate paths for a dungeon while trying to progress. For example, if your partner offers to go through either ""**insert story dungeon here**"" or ""_____ Path"", I would always take ""_____ Path"" first as an opportunity to gather up extra items and maybe grind a bit more when you might not have access to Pokémon Square. The ""_____ Path"" dungeons can be gone through any number of times you want until you feel ready to take on the story dungeon at hand, so take advantage of these breathers the story gives you to level up and restock because they only give you one or two.

Also, EAT ALL YOUR GUMMIS. Especially ones that suit you and your partner's type! The partner/teammate AI is horrible in Rescue Team, and eating enough Gummis to raise your and their IQ can eventually make the game almost TOO easy once you max or near-max their IQ stat. You even get to unlock a ton of cool skills!

But you can also always take advantage of team tactics and going into your teammates' menus to select and deselect moves so they won't be too stupid and use the most inappropriate moves at the most inopportune times.

Sorry for the wall of text, and I know it might be a lot to take in, but it's all easier done than said, trust me. This is all just stuff I've learned through trial and error and childhood experience, as well as from hearing others' experiences when playing through this game. Best of luck!

And don't worry too much about what level you are! People finish Rescue Team on average between levels 26-38, so it's more than possible to finish the main story anywhere between those levels (more or less)! ",2016-04-21 22:24:13+00:00,d2cb2xw,1.0,t3_4fv9tn,2851.0,MysteryDungeon

Though now that your post explains it, it *is* pretty interesting how these tracks were titled. Another VGM music uploader (not the one I linked above, but someone else whose channel name I forgot) uploaded the majority of the PSMD OST back in September when the game first came out in Japan, but only named them by their file names rather than using the Jukebox's official names (because the game wasn't in English at the time).

So I saw all these PSMD OST video titles with ""BGM_DLC"" as a title and immediately raised an eyebrow. Those videos were all deleted days after, but at the time, when I knew next to nothing about PSMD, I imagined there would be Gates-esque OST incoming for Super.

But then it makes me think back to all the DLC tracks Gates had. I had Gates, but didn't buy any of its DLC, so I'm not sure if Craggy Coast, Apple Woods, the original Amp Plains, and the like were a part of Gates's DLC packages at some point, but it's likely. More likely than Super possibly having planned DLC, anyway. After all, the *entirety* of Gates's OST exists hidden inside Super's files--having the Gates DLC tracks in it as well wouldn't surprise me, if that were the case.

Though it does make sense. Explorers was built almost entirely off Rescue Team's groundwork--so having Super being built off the groundwork Gates to Infinity laid seems to be a likely reason as to why all this unused content is here.

Super also has all of Gates's character portraits hidden in it as well--Munna's, Gurdurr's, Quagsire's, etc. All unused in Super because Gates's cast doesn't play as big a role here.",2016-04-21 06:03:12+00:00,d2be93t,3.0,t1_d2b8ywo,10953.0,MysteryDungeon

537,"I wouldn't say it was lazy... Their review was very flawed, sure, but I can kind of see where IGN was coming from ragging on Sky for being practically the same game released for a third time.

The main series games have the excuse of Game Freak getting used to the new system they're working with so they could improve upon it, as well as adding version exclusives to encourage trading and interaction with other people... But even then that's barely seen as a justified excuse to release literally the same games over and over. Yes, Diamond/Pearl were absolute garbage single player-wise and even graphically compared to Platinum, for example, but then it sort of makes you wonder why you would bother buying either of the first two games in any given generation at all when the third one is clearly going to be the same thing but better.

With PMD, while Time/Darkness did have version exclusives, the idea of interacting with other players isn't enforced anywhere *near* as much as it is in the main series games, especially when anyone could just look up Wonder Mail codes to get everything they want. So it might cause some consumers who bought either or both Time/Darkness feel a bit let down that they may have wasted their money when they could have just waited a little over a year for the better version, and for the same price.

Explorers didn't have the same excuse Rescue Team did by having Red and Blue be released on two different systems; so it's only Explorers that's guilty of falling under main series trends and not exactly handling them as effectively as they could have. It's also why every release after Sky has only ever been one game at a time--no alternate or improved versions of Gates or Super to be found.

While yes, as a standalone game, Sky is *amazing*, and seeing its improvements over Time/Darkness may make it look even better, but when compared to them, some might wonder why they released Time/Darkness in the first place, or why anyone would even bother buying those two anymore. IGN should have explored their perspective of Sky not just in comparison to the other PMD games, but as its own game as well, and they only did the former.",2016-04-19 22:06:58+00:00,d29h2ko,3.0,t1_d29cfew,6142.0,MysteryDungeon

Gates even had a few static characters of its own. You don't see Quagsire developing very much, for example. He emotes and sympathizes with the rest of cast, sure, but he doesn't go through any major struggles or has many complex motivations compared to say, Gurdurr or Dunsparce.

As for the characters, yeah, supporting characters don't always have to be dynamic and are more often than not static to begin with. But while I absolutely loved Wigglytuff's Guild and all of its members as a kid (being mildly indifferent to some of them at best), as I grew older, I just found it a tiny bit jarring how the majority of them were just used for occasional moral support and nothing else. And that's why their one-noteness and overuse of their catchphrases were there; almost as an attempt to *make* them lovable and memorable since they weren't really going to do much outside of that.

And while that strategy definitely worked, it was the minor things that got me, like, ""Why did none of the Guild members notice the totally conspicuous Drought Stone 10 feet away from base camp when we were all walking down the same path?"" Stuff like that, as well as the main character and partner doing 98% of the work, made it seem like the rest of the characters, despite being more experienced than you, were just deadweight.

But I understand that's just an unnecessarily-detailed nitpick on my part. Sky was a great game with great characters and a solid story, despite its flaws. But people tend to overhype it so much that it overinflates newcomers' expectations to the point they come out of it not liking it as much as we intended.

The whole point of introducing someone to something is to give them the same feeling of surprise and wonder as many other newcomers did. Most of us came into the PMD series with zero expectations, or were too young at the time to care about something being ""overhyped"" or didn't have the means for things to be shoved in our faces by other people. Spreading PMD to others should mean allowing them to experience things in a similar way we did.

Not like Undertale where a lot of the people that *did* like it began to over praise it and force people to play the game a certain way *so much* that it came to the point where some people began to hate the game because of that, dismissing or refusing to acknowledge any charm or emotion the game had that only its fans were able to see. (Same is happening to the Earthbound/Mother series, unfortunately. I still like Undertale and Earthbound/Mother, but it saddens me to see people go crazy with its limelight that it's starting to discourage others from wanting to give them a fair, unbiased shot).

I don't want that to happen to PMD. Let alone Sky.

I feel having the partner's being downplayed in Super is fine, considering the player was adopted by Nuzleaf as well, and in such a hasty situation at that.

I just didn't see a good rationale for why Nuzleaf wanted you to stay when he's been warning you about the Beheeyem pretty much every single day...and now that the hero hears they're right outside the village, he wants you to stay when leaving would be the best option? It got me going ""hmmm"" at best.

557,"Ah geez. I just realized I'm a complete idiot. Back when I made this comment, I probably meant to put ""you and your partner lost their evolved forms"" but put their scarves instead. That makes more sense considering I also talked about Dark Matter being hyped up to be super strong because of how ancient it was and how many Pokemon it had turned to stone. I do know that you only lose your scarves in the post game. That was a blip on my part. Still, losing your evolved forms is still a pretty big deal, especially considering you needed them against Entei and Yveltal.

Though I noticed you didn't mention how I and a few other people said the protagonist talks through parentheses occasionally rather than through actual words. I'm not going to re-explain my and the others' explanations for that, and I suggest rereading those comments.

Also, saying ""We have nothing left"" only to realize he has something left within a span of like, ten seconds, and calling that a major complaint or fault of the protagonist and calling him stupid as a result sounds like a major nitpick to me. 

Not all of your criticism I felt was nitpicking, but you complaining about the protagonist not doing much about being watched or feeling hopeless for just a few seconds instead of being his usual near-perfect self felt like really minor blows that didn't matter much in the plot anyway.

562,"That's exactly why I respect Gengar. I still hate his guts and don't forgive him for all the horrible things he did during the main story, but I liked how subtly he was written near the end of it, as well as how he was expanded upon in the post-game.

The night before you go off to Sky Tower and Gardevoir comes to visit you in your final dream, Gengar sneaks into your house and says something along the lines of, ""So you're a human, too, huh? I never expected that..."" and assumes that you must be just as bad a person as he was to be turned into a Pokémon as well, regardless of you having amnesia and not being the human from the Ninetails Legend.

After all, it's not like he's met any other humans-turned-Pokémon in all the time he's lived in this world, so it's a fair assumption.

But then, after attempting to do you harm and eat your dreams, he leaves and overhears Gardevoir talk about how she still cares for her former partner even to this day, in the state she's in, and that serves as the turning point when Gengar begins to question all of the bad things he's done and why he did them.

He starts to feel conflicted about what he should do with himself now, and teeters on keeping his reputation as a ""meanie"" or doing the right thing. That's why he didn't want Xatu to tell you he helped make the Teleport Gem. That's why he pretended to drag you to the Dark Land when he was really trying to save you after being hit by the meteor's explosion.

He's still a bad-natured person at heart and he knows it. But he's still willing to change deep down.

And that's why he doesn't seem up to doing much of anything for most of the post-game. Even Medicham and Ekans start wondering what's up with him and where he's been going off to on his own.

He's been lamenting his mistakes and trying to atone for them, but doesn't want anyone else to get involved in his personal business. He's never wanted to make a show of weakness and compassion, and that's why it's such a big step forward for him to swallow his pride and eventually come to you if all people to ask you to escort him to Mt. Freeze and Murky Cave. Even if he tends to hide his true feelings under his usual jerky facade.

And when he finally opens up in Murky Cave... Seeing him burst into tears for the first time, and doing something selfless for the first time in his life without denying his true feelings... It really showed how much he had grown overtime and how much he had been bottling up, even before he saw Gardevoir again in your dream.

He had just been hiding from his mistakes and his past under the guise of his usual mischievous actions this whole time.

And even after Gardevoir's physical form is restored, Gengar still doesn't get off scott-free. Gengar is still stuck as a Pokémon. Gardevoir still has no memories of him. 

But he's satisfied with that anyway, because this outcome guarantees Gardevoir happiness in a new life.

And that's what gets me the most about Gengar. Nearly every other PMD character--good or bad--always comes out of nearly *every* situation with practically *no* consequences to them--but Gengar still had to suffer the punishment of not being able to return to the human world...and not being able to truly interact with his old partner again. And by this point, he's become mature enough to accept that that's okay, and that he'll adjust and move on as long as Gardevoir's alive and happy.

He even seems to have disbanded Team Meanies, allowing Medicham to form a team with Gardevoir and Lopunny, and later decides to settle down in Baram Town with new friends.

And in Super, he seems to have found his perfect calling in life. You find out he's made friends with a Banette who lives in Capim Town--and his mission involves you sending her a letter filled with all kinds of horrible insults and degrading words that any other Pokémon would be extremely hurt by.

But then you find out Banette actually *liked* the letter, and that she needs tons of negative emotions like those to survive. 

I feel that mission alone summarizes Gengar's actions in Rescue Team's post story to a T--him doing the right thing, but masking it under a mean, cruel facade.

I was glad to see Gengar could finally be *himself* around other Pokémon who accepted him for what he is. A meanie.",2016-04-13 23:48:10+00:00,d21vt6o,2.0,t1_d21twja,2818.0,MysteryDungeon

Seeing his letter above all the others when you and your partner leave Serene Village for the first time... His letter was the one that brought me to tears over all the rest.

I really liked the implied friendship Carracosta has with Nuzleaf as well. When you, your partner, and Espurr return to Serene Village after defeating Dark Matter, it's Carracosta out of all the villagers who tells everyone what happened to Nuzleaf and what he decided to do and why. I personally think Nuzleaf went to Carracosta personally to talk about this before quietly leaving out on his own without telling anyone else. 

It's subtle, but it's an endearing gesture, and makes me smile knowing both of our parental figures are quite possibly just as good as friends as the hero and partner are.

Really wish he had a bigger role in the game, but I guess Carracosta was always more into settling down and living a peaceful, quiet life away from all this end-of-the-world ruckus, so it'd be hard to do that much more with him.

566,"**Rescue Team:** Gengar. The most immature and heartless character of the entire series who became one of the most mature by the end of the post-game. I loved his backstory, as well as him also being a human from the human world like you were. That contrast between the protagonist and Gengar himself--as well as how they treated both of their partners--along with how Gengar actually still had to endure *consequences* for his actions, even after he tried to repent and tried to bring Gardevoir back, made me respect him all the more. Most other PMD characters--both protagonists and antagonists alike--end up going out scott-free of their actions, which is why I wasn't too fond of Gates's ""we-never-forgot-you-anyway-because-friendship"" plot point at the end and why I originally assumed Gates's post-game was going to delve deeper into everyone's memory loss *while* trying to bring you back. But it didn't. Gengar *did* manage to bring Gardevoir back, and while she was grateful, she still had no memory of her time together with Gengar, which made his redemption all the more bittersweet. The subtle way he was revealed to be a human during the main story, and how he reacted to pretending to meet her again for the first time always gets me. I was happy to see him again in Baram Town with new friends who actually *benefit* from his mean and mischievous nature. It was like he finally found his place in the Pokémon world after being considered a misfit outcast who hated everyone.

**Explorers:** Episodes 2 and 5. Gave so much depth to otherwise one-note characters or characters I didn't like very much or didn't appreciate as much as I could've from their actions in the main story alone. The main story really made Wigglytuff's competence and intelligence ambiguous during the main story, which made it hard for me to see why everyone respected him. Episode 2 (and 4, but 4 wasn't one of my *favorite* parts of the game per say) really cleared that up for me, and Igglybuff's relationship with Armaldo brought a tear to my eye. And getting to see Grovyle's motives and relationship with Celebi and the other Pokémon of the future, as well as getting to see that Dusknoir was more than just a standard evil villain who had legitimate reasons for doing the bad things he did, was nice as well.

**Gates:** The character dynamic between the main cast, and the idea of having multiple main characters, all with established backstories. The antagonists needed a bit of work, but I liked how well-written the chemistry was between the protagonists. It felt like I was in an actual team who were legitimate friends with each other, with each Pokémon having something unique to offer, coupled with a likable-enough personality. This was a camaraderie I didn't feel as much with Wigglytuff's Guild, and only felt *snippets* of with the minor characters from Rescue Team and the Expedition Society/Serene schoolkids in Super. Emolga, Dunsparce, Virizion, Umbreon, Espeon, Keldeo, Hydreigon, the partner, and the protagonist... They all had a part to play and all pulled their own weight while working well together as a team. As equals.

**Super:** The gameplay elements they fixed and polished. I loved not having to deal with horribly dumb partner AI anymore. And with all the character cameos, it wasn't even trying to be subtle about all the different games being connected anymore, so seeing all those childhood headcanons suddenly be confirmed in front of my eyes was amazing. The supporting cast of the story was great, too, the story trying to give us the best of both worlds from each game...though I do wish the plot did more with the expanded world. The post-game *attempted* to have the plot revolve around the other continents, but not in a way I was expecting...but it was fun nonetheless.^AlsoEspurrisgreat♥",2016-04-12 22:22:07+00:00,d20eydg,1.0,t3_4ei2tp,6143.0,MysteryDungeon

571,"* A character doesn't always have to spell everything out for you to be effective. Everything you need to hear from Super's protagonist is already said in his mind, and you already get to see what his personality is like via what he says when he's thinking to himself. He shows plenty of reactions to what's going on in the story and acts accordingly, but isn't as outgoing or proactive as the partner. That talking motion he does whenever he says anything to any of the other characters should be enough to signify what he needs to say.

If he says, (""Hmm, should I tell my partner that she might be a bit annoying? It's true that she doesn't tend to keep other people's thoughts in mind when making decisions, and does tend to act rather rash..."") and then does that talking motion to confirm those thoughts to her, it's no different than having him say all of that out loud because he's pretty much telling her exactly what he said in his head, almost word for word. If he did say all of that out loud, then the dialogue would just be overly-redundant and it'd be written more similarly to Explorers.

* True, the protagonist had literally no role in the story. If the Luminous Water wasn't just a big red herring and actually had a role in the story besides showing that the bad guys have won, he'd be more relevant. But the only thing that made him special was his ability to break down the barrier on Revelation Mountain, and after that, he had no other reason for being there. But he also helped support your partner and helped them grow strong.

* I don't see how or why that's stupid... What was he *supposed* to do when he was being watched? He told his partner and a few others, but that didn't change anything. Both times were by Espurr and the third time was presumably by post-game Nuzleaf anyway, so it's not like him being watched was a detriment to anyone in any way. I don't understand why you're mad about this. It's not like he could see who was watching him; he did what any normal person would do if they felt like they were being watched but had no confirmation if they actually were. It just feels like a huge nitpick on your part.

As for your complaint on the Dark Matter fight, that also sounds rather nitpicky. He just lost his scarf! So did his partner! It's only natural to feel just a tiny bit hopeless after losing the source of your power, the only thing keeping you from turning to stone, *and* what all the other characters hyped up to be what set you and your partner apart from every other Pokémon. The protagonist from Gates also began to feel hopeless when fighting the Bittercold, as were the Post Town residents, and you don't seem like you'd be mad at those characters for ""just feeling hopeful already"" during those ten seconds of weakness.

Dark Matter is a big, bad, ancient pile of negative energy. No one would think two unevolved children could take it down. Neither did you or your partner, but with everyone turned to stone, they had no choice but to accept their words of encouragement and keep fighting anyway, ""no matter how weak they were, or how powerless they seemed."" I feel like you're just backseat-thinking the protagonist there. You complain that almost everyone in Super is near-perfect, yet fault the protagonist for his flaws, especially ones as minor as these just for not being able to think straight in a dire situation. :l

Also, as for where everyone was in the Voidlands--the majority of the Expedition Society was eaten by Void Shadows. Mawile and the Legendary Beasts were either eventually consumed as well or are still (somehow) fighting to this day, fatigued and still outnumbered. That's why they weren't shown still in the Voidlands.

Your partner simply says everyone is here with them ""in spirit"". That doesn't mean everyone is still safe somewhere in the Voidlands, nor does that mean they somehow managed to break free of the Void Shadows while some of them were being slowly taken over and eaten away at.

That's why I feel the developers didn't cut to panning scenes in the Voidlands, to keep the Void Shadows a legitimate threat *and* to show that, despite being attacked, everyone's feelings of hope for you still managed to reach you.

And I feel that seeing everyone praying for you in the Voidlands would make being sent there seem like less of a blow, or less of a big deal. The idea of being turned to stone was written to sound intimidating, as was the entire Voidlands arc, but having to see all the Pokémon of the world in the Voidlands cheering you on with little to no harm done to them would've taken away from that, in my opinion.",2016-04-12 02:24:02+00:00,d1zbbzv,4.0,t1_d1z9xfs,2050.0,MysteryDungeon

573,"I'm surprised that this was the first time the PMD series has ever directly told you that you're playing as an adult as well. In Explorers, it was a little ambiguous, and Gates's depiction of the protagonist is vague enough to signify that it's literally you playing as the character. Part of me thinks Super was more direct about this and how old the protagonist was so they could reel the adult fanbase back into the series, especially considering they relied a lot on nostalgia from the past games to help market the game, and probably to bring back people who didn't like Gates and how different that was to the other games.

As for the protagonist's involvement in the past, I actually came to a different conclusion you did. While no one in the game specifies what form you were in when you fought Dark Matter in the ancient past, I always assumed you were a Pokémon back then as well, simply because that's the same transformation all humans from the human world undergo whenever they enter the Pokémon world to save it. To prevent the risk of distorting the fabric of space any more than an act like this normally would.

As for your theory, I feel it could work, but the sequence right after the title screen when you open the game up for the first time shows Mew had been trying to find you in the human world for quite a while. As in, the only moment the game uses the 3DS camera to show a reflection of you and your surroundings.

""Hey! It's you! I've been searching all over just to find you, you know?""

While that *could* mean Mew had found the protagonist's spirit rather than their human body, she seemed to pleasantly surprised to see you that I doubt that would be the case. As for why she turned you and herself into different Pokémon, this would simply be a repeat of what you presumably did in the ancient past the first time you first entered the world of Pokémon to stop Dark Matter, but this time, Mew decided to join you herself as a different Pokémon. 

Plus, since every PMD game likes to advertise that ""you"" are in fact the protagonist being sent *inside* the game for immersion's sake, I doubt the game would revolve around a spirit rather than the player themselves.

That, and everyone in the game tends to follow the assumption that you did indeed return to the human world after they defeated Dark Matter for the first time.

It's definitely an interesting theory, though! It actually sounds plausible...and dark. 

Another theory I saw a few months back suggested that every protagonist in every PMD game is the *same* human, who jumps through the bounds of time and space to save the world each and every time, with or without their memories. While I don't agree with it from a storytelling perspective, the amount of support it had also sounded just as plausible.

580,"Funimation's English version of ""Romantic Ageru Yo""/""I'll Give You Romance"" always reminded me of the main cast of Gates to Infinity (specifically the main characters--the hero, partner, Emolga, Dunsparce, Virizion, Umbreon, Espeon, and Hydreigon). The English lyrics sound so hopeful and are worded better than any subtitles I could read from the Japanese version. Almost like they were describing the partner while speaking as him at the same time, encouraging everyone to join him. With visuals focusing on the first half of the story. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzJcLxGwXhk&amp;list=PL6-SyLr8HvSqiNqL-PTWgNqQkIHZSPVxg&amp;index=3

And Kyurem's theme bares a few similarities with Duel of the Fates from Star Wars: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzVBqBosf5w

Lala19357's ORAS remix of his/her fanmade battle theme--Batle! Team Zephyr Grunt--is amazing and makes me think of the Beheeyem from Super Mystery Dungeon. Almost makes me think this theme would play if there were an anime series of the game, during an added ""filler"" scene where the schoolkids spot the Beheeyem crossing through the village late at night to head to Lively Town and confront them in a fight [](#s ""sometime after the hero and partner leave the village."") If only both groups were more relevant to the story. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc2xNgjDB_k

Some of the Nichijou OST also reminds me of tracks that could play during the slice-of-life arc half of the story in Serene Village, [](#s ""either while the hero's there or at any point during his stay, before he came to live there, or after he leaves, to see what its inhabitants were doing then."")

583,"This makes perfect sense. Though I wouldn't give the Pokémon series nowadays too little credit--it still bases several aspects off of its series on real life. The Pokémon World is still pretty much an exact replica of our own world--they're just more subtle about it now.

Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh are all based off actual regions of Japan, even though every region past Kanto has a made-up name instead of the exact name of the region it was based on.

Unova is based off an actual region in the U.S., but the places you visit within it are all just random landmarks across the entire country thrown into one region.

Same for Kalos with France.

I feel the series just figured it'd be cool to slightly modify the real world just a tiny bit in Gen 1, but the longer the series went on the writers decided to make the world more and more like its own thing while still staying true to the idea that it's basically the real world but in Pokémon form.",2016-04-08 07:34:22+00:00,d1uo2al,1.0,t3_4cdqvm,878596.0,pokemonconspiracies

587,"&gt; The destruction of time is a slow process, yes? It doesn't happen immediately. Therefore, the outlaws make sense, because time is in progress of dying.

Inaccurate. While the destruction of time is indeed a slow process, Special Episode 2 takes place when Igglybuff was a child, when the world was at peace many years ago. At the beginning of Explorers, Chatot and a few other Pokémon state that time going out of whack in certain areas has only happened somewhat recently. And I really doubt Darkrai spent *decades* slooowly chipping away at Temporal Tower and sneaking past Dialga in hopes time might start stopping. After all, he seems to have distorted space and given tons of Pokémon nightmares somehow within a matter of several weeks/a few months. Surely his attack on Temporal Tower happened a few months before the main game started as well.

I feel like part of why you feel the way you do is because you only saw LPs of the game, meaning you weren't able to see every single mission or every single line of progressing idle NPC dialogue throughout the game, or get to explore the world for yourself. Those alone, while completely optional, really help give life to the world and characters of each game, no matter how minor. In PSMD, Munna references the horrible things she had done in the past in Baram Town after a certain point in the game and stays there for the remainder of it. And you learn a bit more about Krookodile by talking to him as the story progresses during the more filler-y parts of the game as well.

Though yes, even with all this, PSMD doesn't spell out its moral dilemma as well as Gates does, and tries to be more subtle about it away from the plot. Whether that's for better or for worse is debatable to me, though. After all, PSMD *does* hammer in you're viewing this story from a child's perspective. While the other PMD protagonists were children as well, the children in PSMD are more realistic in a sense they were raised in a more secluded area away from the world's real problems, while the other PMD children from all the other games were raised with it firsthand.

&gt; Super has Pokemon who lure you into Monster Houses ...Yeah, I know that. But, I mean, you beat them, so it's all good, right? Right?

That still doesn't excuse the fact that they're still hostile to you in the overworld, and that some Pokémon like that only join your team as an attempt to save face, keep themselves from being defeated by you, or pretend to join you as an act so they won't get arrested if they're working for you under your watch. Some are just having innocent fun and got too carried away, but others...",2016-04-08 04:48:59+00:00,d1ukf3p,7.0,t1_d1uhk2v,5391.0,MysteryDungeon
588,"Actually, Outlaws ran rampant in Explorers both before and after the destruction of time. Like Armaldo in ""Igglybuff the Prodigy"", and all the Outlaws you face in the post-game (Froslass, Gyarados, Sneasel to some extent, etc.).

The destruction of time only caused more Mystery Dungeons to form and more Pokémon to become unruly because of that. While more Outlaws sprouted because of that as well, Outlaws continued to exist well before and well after time started going out of whack.

And in Gates to Infinity, Outlaws continued to exist as well, even after the main story, which is why Quagsire still ran his job as Sheriff of Paradise, punishing evildoers thoroughly, mmm-hmm. 

After all, it would be unrealistic for an entire continent to have *every single inhabitant* feel hopeful. While the main cast of Gates did a good job at spreading those feelings around greatly, obviously not every Pokémon would hear or listen to their message.

And Rescue Team didn't exactly have Outlaws yet as a game mechanic, nor were they referenced by name, but many Pokémon did in fact talk about bad Pokémon existing, like Team Meanies, though the main problem you had to face were the fickle townsfolk of Pokémon Square and the Pokémon who had grown tired of the natural disasters plaguing the world, like Skarmory, who normally meant well, but was sick and tired of her home getting destroyed by constant earthquakes to think rationally. 

So to correct you on that front, Outlaws are *not* a cause of each game's end-of-the-world plotline in the story. Pokémon become Outlaws the same way people become criminals in real life--different circumstances and situations and different downward spirals that lead them to live the life they do.

So no, there's *plenty* of reason to believe Outlaws were not kept at bay by the time PSMD started.

And since the Bulletin Boards are gone, Outlaws have taken advantage of the lack of Outlaw Notice Boards across the world so they can sprout even more crime through the Connection Orb. Some Outlaws in PSMD are even the same ones from Explorers--like Froslass and Gyarados. Corrupt teams still exist--like Team Rogue and Team Skull. 

And other new Pokémon become bad on their own--Krookodile implies that he wasn't always bad, and had gone through some kind of hardship to make him hate the world and support the turning-to-stone incidents. He's about as vague as Munna was on that front, only he isn't anywhere near as relevant of a character as she was.

Though you *are* right in saying that PSMD didn't do the best job in portraying constant negativity in the world without prior knowledge of the other games. None of the other aspects I mentioned were very Dark Matter-worthy, and Gates did a much better job at building up the Bittercold.",2016-04-08 02:26:58+00:00,d1ufnnx,5.0,t1_d1u6k0u,13908.0,MysteryDungeon

591,"True, true. The only examples of PSMD's ""negativity"" were:

* The times Pancham, Shelmet, and even the hero admitted the partner was annoying.

* The times Pacham and Shelmet bullied other Pokémon, like Goomy.

* When Solosis and the Litwick were temporarily kidnapping Pokémon and scaring them to survive.

* When Rayquaza and potentially other Pokémon were getting scared at the prospect of getting turned into stone.

* The betrayal Nuzleaf set up with the hero and the Beheeyem.

* When the Legendary Beasts were being selfish jerks to the hero, the partner, and Mawile.

* And whatever Krookodile went through to make him hate the world and want everyone turned to stone.

But most of these moments are nowhere near as in-depth and depressing as what the Gates characters went through. Pancham and Shelmet were just mischievous kids, the Litwick never meant any major harm and were desperate for food, and Dark Matter itself was the cause of all these Pokémon getting scared of being petrified. Heck, that betrayal by Nuzleaf and the negativity sparked from that was also Dark Matter's fault, so those two shouldn't even count.

Having the Legendary Beasts be selfish jerks was a nice change of pace that could've been expanded upon a bit more, but instead their negativity was all an elaborate ruse so the partner wouldn't whine like their usual determined self about dragging them back to the real world with her.

And Krookodile also had the potential for some legit motives for doing what he did and why he felt the way he did throughout the story, but it never goes that in-depth into it and the story instead uses him as an obvious red herring. (I liked the gradual spurt of development he got in the post-game, though. It was really sweet. Krookodile X Miltank OTP.)

Dark Matter later goes to say that its growth was ""all our fault"", blaming all of creation for making it form over the past several centuries. It mentions prejudices and wars, but focuses on other Pokémon across different parts of the world we've never seen or interacted with. Some that are probably already long gone by now.

Though I feel it's a bit hypocritical considering Dark Matter caused some negativity of its own to let its plans come to fruition.

As for examples of negativity that you don't see in the main story, but instead through optional NPC dialogue:

* Gengar's mission in Baram Town involves him asking the hero and partner to deliver a really nasty letter to Banette in Capim Town, filled with horrible insults and really rude choice words. The twist in that mission is that you find out Banette actually *liked* the letter, revealing she loves stuff like this and needs a ton of negative feelings like those to survive. So if anything, this was more of a good deed by Gengar under the guise of a bad one, probably because he wants to keep his reputation up as a ""meanie"".

* Skuntank of Team Skull lives in Capim Town now, so it's implied he, Koffing, and Zubat are up to their usual shenanigans.

* Thanks to Bulletin Boards now being considered a thing of the past, Outlaws have managed to disguise themselves as friendly Pokémon or Pokémon in need, luring innocent Pokémon deep into a dungeon to attack them, either out of sadistic pleasure, getting the chance to rob them once their defeated, testing their strength, etc. Kinda like what the Pawniard Brothers did with Dunsparce.

But should these even count? Gengar's mission is completely optional and easily could've been ignored if you just did all your missions in the Water Continent during the main story, as are all the ""Outlaw"" Connection Orb missions as well. And going to any other continent other than the Air Continent is also completely optional.",2016-04-07 17:51:09+00:00,d1tthaw,2.0,t1_d1tffof,19338.0,MysteryDungeon

How they got there all the way from Serene Village without Lapras's help and without any of the Lively Town residents noticing is probably because of Dark Martter's or Yveltal's help. (After all, Roselia and a few other villagers took notice of the Beheeyem, and they clearly found them strange despite them not actually entering the village yet. Surely if they entered Lively Town other denizens would say the same).

Yes, we lost them in Lush Forest, but that's what Nuzleaf wanted us to believe. Nuzleaf also wanted us to think his constant leaving for days on end was just him going on adventures instead of turning Pokémon to stone with his fellow minions.

Explorers of Sky already had a ton of references to Rescue Team already that Time/Darkness didn't--mainly when it came to reusing a lot of the same music and potentially some of the same characters--so it isn't too farfetched to say that the earthquake that struck Shaymin Village and blocked it off from all outside inhabitants may have been a result of Groduon's doing way back when his power was unrestrained!

And yeah, Mr. Mime is preeeetty mysterious. I doubt he'd have been friends with Scizor, though, because Scizor's been frozen for decades. Like a Captain America-type of thing. So Scizor's more of some rumored myth or celebrity that some explorers like to reminisce or talk about that everyone presumed forever lost until the hero and partner saved him from Froslass.

My headcanon about Sneasel is that he's the younger brother of Team AWD's Weavile, trying to look cool like his more rebellious, thieving older sister because he was inspired by her and her team's exploits. That explains why Sneasel's so bad at all the bad things he does and how inexperienced he is, as well as how quickly he learned his lesson. 

I also personally think the Mawile from Team Frontier is the same one in PSMD. As is the Ampharos that lived atop Sky Peak for a while. Maybe the Sky Peak arc could be how they met, and Team Frontier eventually disbanded once Spinda took down his café to go traveling the world again himself!

Yes, I know it's a bit redundant to make every Pokémon of similar species related to one another and have every specific Pokémon be the same character each game, but those two headcanons help make the Sky Peak arc of the game so much less rushed and shoved in there just for the sake of giving Explorers of Sky something unique that Time/Darkness didn't.

But when one of the Beheeyem managed to hit you with a psychic attack, THAT was the moment Mew decided to wipe your memories, to make it *seem* like it was the antagonists that did it when it was really her.

If you had no memories from the start, it wouldn't explain why you ran away from the Beheeyem when they attacked you in the first *shown* cutscene of the game instead of fighting them head-on like Nuzleaf said you did.

Considering Mew from the past was able to reunite and talk to you again right after the title screen and ask you a series of random questions to determine what you and she would look like in the present, it isn't too farfetched to say that she also decided to wipe your memories at some conveniently opportune moment to mess with the bad guys and give them a false sense of security.

Mew *is* a bit of a rambunctious prankster after all, in any incarnation.

The majority of the Guild members--excluding Bidoof, Chatot, and Wigglytuff--all felt like background props that were just *there* and contributed nothing to the story. Personality-wise, everyone *but* those three were pretty shallow, too, and I guess they seemed to acknowledge this by *making* us remember them by having their catch-phrases or signature laughs said every other line.

Sky's Special Episodes made me like the Guild overall a lot more (even if the episodes have a slightly more awkward translation than the main story at some intervals), but during the main story, I didn't feel as much of a growing bond with them as I did when I was a kid playing through it for the first time when the game first came out.

In Explorers, it was always you and your partner doing all the work and nothing else 99% of the time, so almost all of the other Guild members felt like deadweight. In Super, that's downplayed a bit when both groups you join--with each group your with (the schoolkids and the Expedition Society) each contributing to the story, advancing it, and helping you out in one way or another while still having a decent character.

As well as all the foreshadowing of how much hotter it gets as you progress through the game--first mentioned by the Litwick and the Serene villagers during the Ancient Barrow arc. I always assumed it was only hot because of the constant mention of it being summer vacation, and figured the Litwick were also referencing that as well as their own flames. And then you have the description of Jirachi's telescope if you ever decide interact with it, foreshadowing his role in the story. Not to mention the Lively Town Pokémon taking note of how much hotter it gets as well, even more so compared to earlier in the game.

I admired how cleverly-written Super's dialogue was and how it doesn't make every single plot point insultingly obvious (like in Explorers) or thrown out in almost total surprise (like in Gates to Infinity, to some extent). Its dialogue was nowhere near as repetitive, monotonous, and awkward as all the past PMD games, too, and I give it props for that. It's like they got really *good* translators and writers to work on the main story dialogue and gave their usual B-team the job of translating the optional NPC dialogue (which resulted in a few errors and mistranslations here and there).

The same way Dark Matter was able to teleport them right in front of the entrance of the Tree of Life: Trunk right after your boss battle with them. Apparently it can just warp its puppets anywhere it wants, at will, much like how Celebi can teleport itself and its friends the same way.

It'd also explain how Dark Matter's minions (namely Nuzleaf) would be able to turn certain Pokémon to stone in several areas around the world--the skies, the seas, the mountains, other continents--while still being able to maintain an alibi in Serene Village. Sure, Yveltal and the Beheeyem would help, too, but I'm sure Nuzleaf especially would go turn certain Pokémon to stone whenever he went out on one of his ""adventures"" whenever he left the player alone, at the beginning of the game.

It does feel a little too convenient, but it *is* explained in the game--through visuals rather than text. I do agree the game's ending was a bit rushed, though.",2016-03-26 00:06:28+00:00,d1dnd25,2.0,t1_d1dm8wb,2003.0,MysteryDungeon

The timeline goes like this, regardless of what universe or alternate turn of events occurred, Mega or not:

Any version of Gen 1/Gen 3 &gt; Gen 2/Gen 4 &gt; Gen 5 &gt; Gen 5.5/Gen 6.

And he *had* said Croagunk in Platinum, his first canonical appearance in the series, in Gen 4. In X/Y, you find out his *only* partner Pokémon died in a case way some time ago. X/Y is Gen 6, and Croagunk is the *only* Pokémon we know he owns.
 
Yes, it *does* make sense that he could have owned an Audino at some point, explaining how he has an Audinite, but we can't just ignore the *other* Pokémon he's been *directly* shown to have owned in the past. While it could be *speculated* he could've owned an Audino way back, it's already *stated* that he owned a Croagunk in another game.

That's why I disagree with your theory in that regard. And that's why I feel he may have just gotten the Audinite through some other means. Assuming that Audino was the partner Pokémon mentioned in X/Y would be a bit too simple and contradictory to explain his story.

What *is* significant to me about Looker's role in OR/AS, is that it could explain why Looker never tells you his name, no matter how close of friends you become with him. He always calls himself by his codename--because ""it's what they call him"". Maybe he later remembers that he's a part of the International Police...but he never remembers his real name, and that's why he's so insistent on everyone calling him Looker.

I liked playing through it again, but a part of me still regrets deleting that file to this day.

And I bought both Time and Darkness because my younger brother wanted to take a crack at the series when we couldn't share Blue, with him having Time and me playing through Darkness. Good times.

Little did I know that they would later pull the same stunt the main series games do by releasing a third game that's basically the same thing but better. That's when I bought Sky and loved it. Luckily my brother was still satisfied with just Time.

I was a sophomore in high school by the time Gates came out, bought it on release, and while I felt it was a step down from Explorers gameplay-wise, I didn't really start to *dislike* it until I was neck deep into the extremely unrewarding post-game. People tell me that the bright side is that I'll be able to play through the story again with nothing to lose, but I'm halfway through the last rank, with Terrakion and Cobalion recruited...

628,"There are other moments in Explorers that do this, too.

Like, when you're told about the planet's paralysis and time going out of whack, sure, everything else you've been told makes sense, but you're never told HOW or WHY time went out of whack in the first place. Why did Temporal Tower collapse in the first place? Why is Temporal Tower in need of the Time Gears in the present? Shouldn't Dialga have been able to fix it himself?

And what was that fateful accident that Grovyle mentioned that happened at the beginning of the game? He mentions ""turbulence"" or something along those lines when describing how they got separated in the Passage of Time, but doesn't go into much detail about it. It surely wasn't Dusknoir, the Sableye, or Dialga, otherwise he'd have brought it up and said that it was them that caused the player's memory loss and transformation into a Pokémon.

And when you beat the main story, you're STILL not answered these things and you're given a bunch of filler-y story arcs after your Guild graduation.

But then you find out space is distorting and Pokémon are having nightmares, and you find that Darkrai is the culprit. 

And not only is Darkrai the culprit here, he also proves that the acts of villainy he had done just then aren't anything new, and then you find that HE was the one who sabotaged Temporal Tower, and HE was the one who blindsided the player and Grovyle at the Passage of Time, hiding in the shadows the whole time.

That reveal was one of the biggest in all of PMD, imo. It wrapped everything together perfectly.

Twists like these were in Explorers not JUST to have a twist for the sake of shock value, but to also provide further meaning into the story and answer questions that were foreshadowed earlier, making everything fit into place.

Sure, the whole Dark Matter arc was greatly foreshadowed through the ""Giratina"" arc, as was your partner's method of solving both issues at hand, but who exactly was suffering from the world's negativity in Super? What prejudices and wars was Dark Matter going on about? Why does it feel the universe *wants* the Earth to get swallowed up by the sun?

Sure, I guess it's *somewhat* justified when you realize Dark Matter's been building for several thousand years and surely *must* have experienced each and every negative part of the PMD world's history, but what was the point of introducing this message if practically *no one* from the main cast felt anything akin to what Dark Matter was claiming?

Especially when all the conflicts and negative events that are happening are *caused* by Dark Matter itself. Nuzleaf, the Beheeyem, and Yveltal were all under its control. 

I guess there's a Banette NPC that admits she needs a lot of negative emotions to survive, and the Litwick gang that need to feed of others' fear for energy, and those *technically* follow the theme of accepting one's negativity, but...

635,"Ah, true, true. I'll give you that.

The game was definitely consistent with its cast feeling hopeless or deceitful in one way or another, but I always expected Munna in particular to have gone through something much worse. I mean, what some of these characters have gone through were really crippling things--especially with Gurdurr--but I feel Munna must have gone through something much more horrible and traumatic to want to kill herself and everyone else.

While Dusknoir's (and the other Pokémon's) conflicts centered around the dark future they lived in and was more *generalized* flatly toward everyone involved in it, Gates's conflicts were more *individualized* and more character-based. While all the Pokémon in the dark future all suffered from the *exact same* problem and went about it through different ways, Gates's cast all had *different, detailed* conflicts and reasons for acting the way they did. 

So while we never got detailed explanations on each antagonists' past in Explorers, we didn't necessarily need them because of how simple-but-effective their problems were. 

In Gates, each character had their own unique set of problems and made each character have their own story to tell, making each main character as fleshed out as possible, so having Munna be an exception to this just felt a tiny bit off to me. Gates's writing style is still effective in its own right; it, like Explorers and all the other PMD games, just has its own set of minor issues here and there.

So while Munna's short admittance that she, too, had gone through horrible things in her past, was a good move on the writers' part, and was more than consistent with the game's main themes, I just feel it would've felt less rushed and would've made her even *better* of a character than she already is if her past was elaborated.",2016-03-22 03:14:00+00:00,d18q6fa,9.0,t1_d18kjmi,8926.0,MysteryDungeon

Also, we didn't need to be shown Dusknoir's past. From seeing the experiences of other Pokémon that live in the future, and seeing how miserable and horrible that world is, we could *infer* the type of things he's had to go through living there. After all, we had to live there for a few days ourselves. What if we lived there all our lives? What if we were the ones constantly threatened by death and the Pokémon around us?

With Munna, we don't see any of that, or anything akin to that. She just tells us vaguely and that's it. 

It's not that it bothers me that much. It's just a flat-out flaw. There are a ton of other flaws I could point out about the PMD games that I could say I even *like*, but that won't stop me from pointing out that it's an issue regardless of my preferences.

In Sky, since you've probably already met (or at least seen) the Mr. Mime in the café before, it'd feel less out of place when said Mr. Mime comes out to talk about Scizor.

* As for why Skuntank wasn't there at the time, who knows. Plot convenience most likely, but if I had to give a story-related reason, maybe he was on some other heist alone at the time? Mugging some other Pokémon elsewhere? Or since it was sunset at the beginning of the game, he might have just been lazily snoozing off or planning their next big scheme while Koffing and Zubat decided to take up smaller heists.

* Yes, they meant the Defend Globe. Time/Darkness left that unclear, but Sky's Special Episode revolved around that precious treasure that Team Skull mentioned. That's also why you unlock Special Episode 2 around the time you finish the Expedition Arc.

* Skuntank said Chatot's yelling gave them just enough energy to stay alive for just a while longer. I personally thought they had died or something until I saw them in Super Mystery Dungeon, since you never see them again in Explorers, but whatever happened to them afterwards and wherever they went from then on is all up to headcanon.

And as for my headcanons on what happened to them after Brine Cave...

I personally think the Guild nursed their wounds once the hero, partner, and Grovyle left toward the Hidden Land. Team Skull would wonder why they'd go to such lengths to help them out after all they've done, and Wigglytuff and the other members would give some speech about how no Pokémon deserves to get left behind, even ones as vile as them. 

Team Skull would then remember (in a flashback, as per usual) that they told the hero and partner that they would go back to their usual wrongdoings once they were healed, and then they would get up once their injuries were taken care of. They'd begrudgingly thank them all as subtly as they can, disguised under a slew of their usual insults, and would head out, deciding not to mess with Wigglytuff's Guild anymore. But this time, they're not just avoiding it because they know Wigglytuff's super strong--they're avoiding them because they feel they owe them for what they've done. After all, since they gave the Relic Fragment back, they've got to have a conscience in there somewhere.

And ever since, they've been reflecting on themselves, more hesitant on their usual schemes as they travel the world, mugging Pokémon and being their usual thieving, jerkish selves. Cut to the present, and Skuntank's hanging out at Capim Town, up to his usual hijinks, but now...he's softened up a bit.

I wouldn't say Team Skull would ever end up being good guys like you mentioned, though. Gengar had a whole post-game arc to lament his wrongdoings in Rescue Team, and even though Team Meanies is broken up, he's still up to no good as usual with a new group of Pokémon...though it's *also* apparent that he seems to have softened up a bit, too.

So don't worry--much like how you were betrayed by and chased into fugitivity by your fellow towns-Pokémon in Rescue Team, I wouldn't judge the other PMD games off of their beginning alone. ; )",2016-03-21 18:09:24+00:00,d183xr3,1.0,t3_4bcvat,7464.0,MysteryDungeon
641,"That would've been *perfect*! [](#pikachu12)

It was odd that they just threw your partner being a negative Pokémon back in the day and did next to nothing with it. Sure, it helped deepen the bond between the hero and partner, and fit with the recurring theme of negativity and despair, but that was about it. 

It was cool that the partner in Gates had an established backstory for once, and a goal that complements that--which automatically makes him a bit better than the partner from Rescue Team and Explorers in my book--but having Munna be a byproduct of that hate he used to have (even if she was affected by him indirectly or something) would be driven everything full circle, and would've made his confrontation with her at the Glacier Palace so much more meaningful. [](#pikachu2)

It was nice to see how convincing and how much of a symbol of hope your partner had become by that point in the game, and how strong he had become to want to change the world to the extent he dreamed of, but having him face his demons one last time in one last reveal would've been perfect. [](#pikachu1)


But then I'd have to wonder how your partner would react to seeing Munna in the Forest of Shadows, and to being captured by her, and how he would feel afterwards when he would get rescued by the hero and Hydreigon. [](#pikachu5)

That's why I feel she'd have to be an *indirect* byproduct of his initial hatred of the world, meaning they didn't necessarily *have* to meet face-to-face prior for it to still work. 

And yes, I do agree, a flashback into Gurdurr's past would've been great. And I also feel they were going on the right track with Munna; I just wanted more elaboration as to what she had to go through to reach that point to want to kill everything. 

Dusknoir's twist was insultingly obvious, don't get me wrong--but him being a somewhat realistic villain in that regard--and him acting on his primal instinct to live much like the rest of the Pokémon in the future, while still keeping his rational mind made him that much better a character to me. Time/Darkness mentioned none of that, while Sky elaborated on it.",2016-03-21 18:01:41+00:00,d183l57,5.0,t1_d17ztok,5185.0,MysteryDungeon
642,"It's not *just* a matter of ""more screen time""; after all, there were plenty of moments in the Dark Future arc during Explorers' main story where Dusknoir wasn't around at all. 

And seeing time stop when Grovyle took the Time Gear in Mesprit's lake first hand, juxtaposed with when you see the state of Treeshroud Forest when the Time Gear Grovyle stole was already placed back, and when he takes the Time Gear *again* when you team up with him later... Even little moments like those really help drive the stakes in a story, let alone a visual one like this. If we were *just* told, ""Oh, hey, I checked out Treeshroud Forest and time was still stopped there so I took the Time Gear back while you were done,"" or if we had left Mesprit's lake before we saw what happened when Grovyle took her Time Gear, neither of those scenes would have been as effective. [](#pikachu5)

It's the kind of thing most people learn in English class around middle school (at least). Whether when you're reading a story together or writing certain essay prompts. ""Show, don't tell."" Whether it's literature, media, or any piece of written work, being flat-out *told* blatant exposition rather than being creative and letting us know what we need to know in any other way isn't *always* the best route to take when telling a story. And since video games are a much more visual medium than novels, they should've taken more advantage of that when writing Gates. [](#pikachu15)

And yes, the dream was indeed foreshadowing. It was an amazingly small detail, and now that you mention it, then yes, Munna being evil was a much more subtle plot twist than Nuzleaf being evil. And the darkness in the Forest of Shadows did in fact capture the mood setting up her betrayal; though when I first played the game, I personally figured the darkness was foreboding Hydreigon showing up and attacking us at any second. Especially since we were shown a fabricated dream of him pursuing her. But I'll give you that; parts of Gates *do* have a sense of subtlety to them. Parts like those--as well as when we see the balls of light of the humans Kyurem's vanquished when he shows up to destroy you--are examples of *showing* rather than just *telling*.

But everything else I mentioned that was *told* in my last comment still stands. All of those other conflicts could've been either expanded upon or elaborated in a some other way.",2016-03-21 17:45:18+00:00,d182ul1,5.0,t1_d17qkra,20844.0,MysteryDungeon
643,"I agree that Munna's character has some depth to her, but what I didn't like about Gates's writing was that it constantly *directly told* you pretty much everything you needed to know about each character rather than *showing* you.

In Explorers, we *saw* the dark future for ourselves. And in Special Episode 5, we *saw* how corrupted, desperate, and insane a lot of the Pokémon were, and how close some of them were teetering on the brink to becoming primal. It's because of that, that I feel it's easier to empathize with Dusknoir and Grovyle and see why they chose the paths they took to survive, with both of their life choices now seen as realistic for even a real person in these types of circumstances. 

But in Gates, we were *told* that the house Gurdurr built was burned down. We were *told* that a lot of the Pokémon in this world are deceitful and selfish. (The Pawniard Bros. and Scraggy--to some extent--are some of the *only* examples of Pokémon that this description describes. Keldeo's and Virizion's conflict was just a simple misunderstanding/lie for the greater good, for example, and the majority of the other conflicts were caused by Munna and her gang, who were apparently tormented by other things we never get to see.) [](#pikachu6)

And when it came to Munna and her gang, we were simply *told* a quick explanation at the last minute about their situation. Much like her plot twist in the Forest of Shadows, it had no build-up, no foreshadowing, and was just dumped on you right then and there. 

""Oh, by the way, I'm actually evil."" 

""Oh, by the way, I'm actually a sympathetic villain."" 

Having no build-up for the Forest of Shadows twist worked well, but the reveal at Glacier Palace wasn't executed as well as it could have been, imo. [](#pikachu5)

And as much as the game likes to tell us exactly what's going on, we're not even *told* what she specifically had to go through to reach that point of wanting to commit suicide-genocide on the whole world. While her backstory justified her actions, it was a little vague and just felt rushed, as if it was thrown in just to perfectly wrap things up. We never even see what happens to her and her gang in the post-game. Sure, it's implied Kyurem saved them, too, but what do they do afterwards? Where did they go? They just seem to have vanished from the plot altogether. Super fills in a *few* blanks, but Munna and Gigalith act like their whole Bittercold phase was *years* ago, so there's still a lot we need to infer.

In Explorers, if all we got was *just* Chatot's and Dusknoir's descriptions of the future in the present and *nothing else* (no Special Episode, no main story arc where we're dragged into the future ourselves, etc.), and if Dusknoir just dumped his whole ""I-just-want-to-stay-alive"" speech *right* before Grovyle threw him back to the future, then I would've felt the same way for Dusknoir as I do for Munna. 

But that didn't happen, and Dusknoir was indeed given an entire arc to develop and expand, with more than just an exposition dump or two dropped at us from out of nowhere. That's why I think he's better-written, to some extent. [](#pikachu1)

And I hope you don't think I'm bashing Gates for the sake of bashing it. I'm just usually really critical of things I really like. I even made a few posts talking about things I didn't like very much about Explorers recently. [](#pikachu16)

Super Mystery Dungeon had some of the least repetitive, most fluent, and all-around most well-flowing dialogue in the whole series, by comparison.

There are a few exceptions to this, though, like Team Poochy being made up of three Poochyena or the packs of territorial Pokémon you fight in boss battles (i.e. Luxray and the Luxio Tribe or Aggron and the Lairon Tribe). And funnily enough, in Sky, the Shaymin in Shaymin Village are the *only* ones to pick up on this trope--being the only ones in the entire series to point out that everyone being called by their species name is a bit ridiculous.

AND they might have to adjust the post-game to have more story arcs, considering Rescue Team gave almost each and every legendary its own story arc and justification for what happened to them during the main story (i.e. Latios and Latias, Deoxys, etc.).

So in that sense, it might be better to just limit the amount of Pokémon in the Rescue Team remake to 386 like before, considering the amount of resizing and story changes they might have to do (since some people hate liberties taken to remakes).

Pancham and Shelmet are good; I just find it funny how Shelmet and Charmander are the only ones that don't sound like children. But considering one's probably a delinquent and the other's an older human trapped in a child's body, it's more than justified. 

The other towns-Pokémon, like Lombre and Hippopotas, are great. Carracosta I always imagined to be the more aggressive, strict antithesis to the calmer, more laid back Nuzleaf.

The other children's parents were just as worried sick and scold-happy as Carracosta was, and though the other children didn't share that same need to leave the village the Partner did, eventually even they'll have to go someday, too.

As for the more critical part, I understand where you're coming from, but the reason I didn't include lyrics in the transition is exactly because it would do exactly that and take away from some of the possible interpretations out there. I feel if this song was expressed visually, the silent transition would either cut to the village and later Carracosta, or some of the Partner's adventures out in the world.

But I guess I either have to pick the lesser of two evils here, making the lyrics either flow better or keeping them vague for the sake of interpretation. Since Serene Village just endlessly loops, I wanted each part of the track to end before each transition.

I'll see what I can do and try to add transitional lyrics in the future, though. Thanks for the feedback! ",2016-03-14 18:20:22+00:00,d0zlw9p,2.0,t1_d0zg93v,7937.0,MysteryDungeon
672,"* Sky has a few minor dialogue changes throughout the game. 

* Croagunk's Swap Shop works somewhat differently in your favor. 

* Sky also has several look-alike items; items that are spelled slightly differently from their counterparts to throw you off. For example, you may find Oren Berries in a dungeon that damage you when you eat them, unlike Oran Berries that heal you. Other look-alike items are actually better than their counterparts, though--like finding a Dough Seed (that increases the amount of money you'll find on the next floor) over a Doom Seed (that lowers a Pokémon's level by one). Others have pretty hilarious effects.

* Spinda's Café is also sky-exclusive. It opens before the halfway point of the game and lets you convert food items into drinks for more powerful effects, as well as recycle any items you don't need for better ones.

* Not only that, but in the post-game, Spinda's Café ends up having its own post-game arc by having you explore Sky Peak with all the other café patrons, a new Exploration Team, and Shaymin.

* Other dungeons (along with Sky Peak) are Sky-exclusive. At some point, you'll unlock Destiny Tower. But you might be a bit disappointed when you reach the top...

* Occasionally you'll run into some secret stairways that you'll only find by getting lucky and stepping on the right tile. These lead to Secret Bazaars, nice little rest stops you can heal up in during a dungeon.

* Pokémon forms that were introduced in Pokémon Platinum--like Rotom's forms, Giratina's Origin Form, and Shaymin's Sky Form--are only exclusive to Sky.

* And some methods you obtain legendaries in Sky are somewhat different. Less legendaries are available through the Secret Slab/Mystery Part now; some legendaries now have their exclusive dungeons, or will send you a mission requesting you to battle them, usually once you reach a certain rank (i.e. Mewtwo sending you a mission to battle him on Sky Stairway).

* The Seven Treasures missions are also easier to get. Rather than having to look up seven different Wonder Mail codes online, you can just gradually get them all in-game at Spinda's Café once Scizor promotes you to the Secret Rank in the post-game.",2016-03-14 17:43:38+00:00,d0zkaaa,3.0,t1_d0zg8qs,5749.0,MysteryDungeon

676,"There's an easy explanation as to how Grovyle, Dusknoir, Celebi, and the Sableye are all in the present. Their future was already saved by Arceus. Surely now that they have the freedom to do whatever they want, they could've simply found a Passage of Time somewhere while exploring and decided to use it to travel back to either visit the hero and partner from Explorers, or to simply explore the past out of curiosity and see how compares to their world in the future now that it's at peace. Or maybe Dusknoir and the Sableye came with Grovyle and Celebi to try to apologize and make amends for their wrongdoings and trickery in the past. There are a ton of possible reasons.

And as for the ancient runes, I guess that's why the characters in Super constantly refer to it as ""ancient foot-shaped writing"" rather than ""foot runes"" like Explorers does, to both differentiate it AND relate to it at the same time. 

Note that all Pokémon tend to write with their feet/footprints, regardless of whether they're ancient or not. In the Foreboding Forest, you see Goomy write his name with his own ""feet"". Surely Pokémon like Deerling and Shelmet do the same, considering they don't have the necessary limbs, either, to the point every Pokémon communicates in writing through their footprints for consistency's sake.

Explorers implies the same thing but to a lesser extent, with Corphish and the other Guild members being able to read the foot writing on the Groudon statue at Fogbound Lake.

The ancient writings in the Hidden Highland and in the Voidlands are probably a more primitive version of the foot writing Pokémon use today, that only certain Pokémon can read. Grovyle says he had studied up on said foot runes, which explains how he's able to read the inscription that confirms the location on the Rainbow Stoneship while neither you or your partner can.",2016-03-12 04:57:58+00:00,d0wvgwo,2.0,t1_d0wtjbs,3921.0,MysteryDungeon
677,"Oh, and another nitpick I have with Explorers is it having too many flashbacks also detracted somewhat from the scene ""Memories Returned"" played at the end of the game. It would've been so much more impactful if we were blindsided with all these flashbacks all at once...rather than be force-fed the same flashbacks we had already seen ten times prior. 

Super did a better job at handling flashbacks--only ever using them when necessary (most of the time). Explorers liked to spam them a lot, especially when we didn't really need a flashback for certain cutscenes to begin with.

The ""Memories Returned"" scene was still arguably the saddest scene in any PMD game (next to Gates's Frism scene), but if we were given less flashbacks throughout the main story, it would've definitely been sadder.

Last nitpick! It also somewhat bugs me how often your partner in the earlier games--especially Explorers--refers to you by your name. It just kinda goes to show how awkward the translation was for the earlier PMD games at times. People rag on Super for its obvious translation errors, but at least it only made mistakes for its optional side missions. Super's main story dialogue was some of the most fluent, fluid, engaging translated dialogue I've read out of all the PMD games (for the most part).

Seeing this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr_kbI-Kf0w (at 2:49 - 3:45) reminded me of how much it irked me a bit. It didn't matter in the long run, but it always felt awkward reading dialogue like that almost all the time.",2016-03-12 01:01:48+00:00,d0wnv2u,1.0,t3_4a1a55,6525.0,MysteryDungeon
678,"I have plenty of nitpicks throughout the entire series...but I still love all the games about the same.

The worst nitpick I have, though, comes from Explorers.

I love a lot of the characters in Explorers, even the ones some seem to dislike, but I have to admit that a lot of them are kiiiinda a bit on the dim side at certain points in the story.

*Especially* Wigglytuff's Guild. Namely, Chatot.

I know Dusknoir did a solid job at making himself look amicable to everyone, but when the guy slowly grabs and drags you and your partner into the Dimensional Hole leading to the future, and proclaims, **""It's too soon for farewells! You two...are coming with me!""** OUT LOUD in front of EVERYBODY, don't you think everyone should've begun to worry and start antagonizing Dusknoir right away?

When you come back to the past, everyone at the Guild's happy you're safe, sure, but they all seem to not have the FAINTEST clue how you went into the future in the first place. Heck, Chatot even antagonizes YOU instead, saying the both of you must have slipped or tripped inside the Dimensional Hole by accident, and that whatever you remembered from the future was just a ""bad dream"".

When it comes to Pokémon of higher status or higher strength than him, Chatot becomes an insufferable, biased suck-up. 

What I want to know is HOW or WHY everyone was so unsure of what happened when it was all so clear. It's not like Dusknoir was even trying to hide his façade anymore at that point, either--I get they might be a bit hesitant to believe Dusknoir was really the bad guy considering all he did for everyone, but still, what he DID in PUBLIC should've caused everyone to start investigating right away! 

Instead, everyone just seems to go, **""... What just happened?""** and they all seem to just shrug it off and go about their daily lives wondering where you and your partner went.

It was ridiculous.

The same thing happened with the Guild members and Team Skull to a lesser extent, but I cut that plot point some slack because it was at least *somewhat* realistic. The Bystander Effect kicking in for the other members when you and your partner were publicly bullied, Team Skull sucking up to Chatot and Wigglytuff to make them immune to punishment even if the rest of the Guild decides to tell on them, etc. That, and having Team Skull call Chatot an idiot for falling for their act in Brine Cave, and having Chatot attempt to make up for his wrongs by running after them...only to end up chastising them in a way that gave them enough energy and adrenaline in them to survive a bit longer after Kabutops's attack was *really satisfying*, and made up for a lot of Chatot's flaws earlier on.

But that scene with Dusknoir was still inexcusable. Even though it's easy to look past it despite my long rant about it, it still bugs me to this day, as a kid or even now. I only consider it a nitpick because I've seen next to no one have a problem with it, let alone talk about it at all.

683,"I get what you're saying about the Guild being stronger, and normally I'd actually agree with you and your reasoning, but a previous comment on this thread actually cleared something up for me:

The Guild is an apprenticeship program. It's meant to toughen up rookie explorers to become stronger so they can graduate and stand on their own. That's why no one there is an experienced explorer (besides Wigglytuff and Charot of course) or has any arduous jobs or specialties to manage. 

The Expedition Society, on the other hand, is where some Pokémon would go for a job *after* they've graduated or *after* they've become full-fledged explorers. That's why the Society is so relaxed. Everyone is there to work, not train, because they've already proven they have the skills necessary to join the Society.

That's why the Society was so hesitant on bringing kids aboard at first. Ampharos only renounced his rule because he saw how strong and capable you and your partner were on your adventures in Serene Village. He even tested you by giving you ""junior"" Expedition Society gear.

So that's why I now say the Society is stronger than the Guild.

And as for Chatot...

Don't get me wrong, I like Chatot, too, but there are times were he looks like an insufferable suck-up. Every time there's a Pokémon who's stronger or has a higher status than him, he constantly gushes about them to no end and will take their word over *anyone* else's in a heartbeat.

Dusknoir announces he's going to forcibly take two kids to the future and promptly drags them into a Dimensional Hole, and what does Chatot do? Ignore it and just assume the two kids tripped or something and tell them they just had a bad dream when they come back after several days! The only reason he even *thinks* about hearing you out in the first place is because the other members (namely Wigglytuff) pressured him into doing so!

Team Skull tricking him I can somewhat understand, and it *is* pretty satisfying to see Chatot get his comeuppance when he confronts them in Brine Cave, but at least those three were *trying* to look innocent at the time (even if their act was easy to see through...and that they had publicly bullied you and your partner in front of all the other members prior). Dusknoir literally snatched the hero and partner, SAID ""It's too soon for farewells! You two are coming with me!"", and *no one* batted an eye!

I don't mind how strict he is, but for the Head of Intelligence of the Guild, Chatot isn't exactly the most intelligent Pokémon around.",2016-03-11 19:30:34+00:00,d0wbd1q,2.0,t1_d0vs6wr,39222.0,MysteryDungeon

While I personally think your partner in Explorers is just extremely shy and naive (since social anxiety can build to a panic attack and has other symptoms that don't exactly apply to what we've seen from him in the game), he could very well have some small form of social anxiety.

There's a difference between just naturally feeling anxious and having any form of anxiety.  

Connie Maheswaran in Steven Universe is an example of a character implied to have social anxiety, especially in the episode ""Alone Together"".

686,"Glad we can textwall this out together, then :D

I personally loved recess. I used to enjoy it to death until all those insecurities, inhibitions, and bursts of shyness kept me from interacting with the other kids. Even when they wanted to approach me, and if it was the same people every time, I'd always end up shying away from everyone even if I knew what to expect. As much as I liked helping clean the school or reading alone, a part of me always wanted to become more bold and outgoing so I could have fun with everyone else and not wallow on my own.

Then my friend came in. Not only was he fun to be around on our own, but he also helped me break out of my shell a bit, allowing me to talk to others and go out to meet the other kids during recess whenever I was with him. It felt like I had someone to mutually rely on when I needed it, as if we had someone we could both fall back on if either of us (namely me) felt they made some kind of mistake or embarrassed themselves in some social situation. I felt like I could do more whenever I was around him. And without him... I felt I couldn't do as much on my own.

Seeing the partner do all those crazy things thanks to the hero being there with him--jumping into a waterfall, diving into a quicksand pit, or even just facing his fears of entering the Guild and meeting its members without freaking out--all of those made me reflect on how I was in reality at the time.

Granted, I was only 11 at the time, and again, while all this sounds silly to an adult or to those who've never gone through a shy phase when they were younger, I was able to see why the partner in Explorers thought the way he did for most of the game. And I was able to view the relationship between the hero and partner as solely platonic because of that. And yes, there *are* moments where your partner is just plain badly-written at times, but that didn't stop me from empathizing with him regardless.

After all, PMD is inherently a children's series above all else (no matter how deep its themes get, how dark the plot becomes, or how realistic its characters may be). So I, being its target audience at the time, was able to fit the mold well. If I had become a fan of the series as an adult/late teenager and only played all of them *then*, I would've been a lot more critical of the games than I already am, chastising them for being silly and not being able to experience anywhere near as much empathy for any of the characters, because I wouldn't remember what it was like to be in the shoes of one.

As for me going into what the PMD writers would and wouldn't think up, that goes back to PMD being a children's series. It goes out of its way to avoid using the words ""die"" and ""love"" in almost every situation those two words should be used. The ways the games *imply* either of those things are fine, but with PMD being such an exposition-driven game that likes constantly pointing out the obvious to you (especially in Explorers), I feel that if they're going to sugarcoat the text that much, I'm certain they'd sugarcoat other words or topics (or just plain not delve into them at all).

Dunsparce is a deep character, yes, but going into detail about each character to the extent many of us on this subreddit do is something I feel the writers didn't go into *as much* thought about.

Whatever an author intended for their story and their readers' interpretations of it often end up being two different things. But the consensus on that--by certain authors, readers, teachers, and professors alike--is that neither's interpretations are wrong, because with the right evidence and support, even the readers can analyze many aspects of a story the author didn't even think of or intend themselves.

687,"YES. PLEASE.

Explorers of Sky was basically Time/Darkness with a ton of DLC added and was passed off as its own game. And all of said ""DLC"" made it arguably the best game in the series.

Seeing that treatment applied to Super would make it EVEN BETTER than it already is. Super's story seemed to be tightly written in a way that acknowledged it probably wasn't going to get DLC or the Sky treatment, so I applaud the writers for doing their best with working with what they had.

If Super *did* get DLC, though, I'd like Special Episodes. All of them. The characters in this game were some of the best in the series on their own, and having some of them get expanded upon in Special Episodes would be amazing. Maybe having some of the plot's loose ends get wrapped up in a Special Episode would be great, too.

I guess I could elaborate on what Special Episodes the game should center around, but I and at least one other person already made a post talking and discussing about exactly that a while back. 

Gates got DLC, but unfortunately none of it was story-related and it was all worthless. It either gave dungeons that made the game easier than it already was or gave extremely long and hard dungeons for the masochistic PMD veterans out there. Really wish that game got the Sky treatment, too.

688,"Your partner in Explorers is a coward. A timid, inexperienced, frail, naive, overly-innocent, overly-reliant, too-trusting coward...that repeats the same sentences over and over and constantly refers to me by my name every other word.

And while there were times he annoyed me in that regard, I still grew to love him anyway.

He's young and shy. All the partners in each PMD game are implied to be children (especially in Super). I was extremely shy as a kid, too, so being unable to go up to people and making a big deal about interacting with others was what I did a lot. Seeing your partner run away the moment he was acknowledged made me feel empathy toward him when I was playing through Time/Darkness when it first came out in 2008 at the time. 

I was too disgustingly shy to walk up to anyone during recess to even greet them, *especially* if anyone came up to me, and would simply watch everyone play while I volunteered to help clean the lunch tables every day instead. Didn't have any friends or anything. Even had a place to feel sorry for myself--when I wasn't cleaning, I would be reading in the library alone, enjoying the beauty of other worlds I would immerse myself into.

Then someone joined me. And we became best friends for quite a while until he had to move schools.

Needless to say, the Explorers games really meshed with me emotionally at that time. 11-year-old me was bawling at the scene ""Memories Returned"" played. Even now, only that scene and the Frism scene in Gates are the only two scenes in the PMD games that made me cry.

While there still moments he drove me crazy, I still appreciated the character for what it was. Maybe he had some form of social anxiety that only the hero could help him cope with? And that's why he was so reliant on you?

Obviously the writers would never go that far when thinking up a PMD character, but it's clear that your partner had a great deal of shyness before he encountered you, and even after he meets you he still retains moments of that same shyness throughout the game. And even though he seems to learn to walk on his own two feet after you disappear, he still misses the hell out of you, to the point he breaks down remembering how you changed him on the beach.

Seeing him progress like that, despite his annoying flaws, was powerful to me and helped me grow more social as a person when I was a lot younger.

So while the partner's shyness at the beginning of the game does seem a bit silly, and makes him look weak, especially in the eyes of an adult or someone who never had very many problems with shyness, I feel that's the *point*. As a child, some people *are* scared of social interaction. Some people *are* afraid to make themselves known to other people, even if they want friends, or if they want to follow their dreams.

It's just something people grow out of as they age.

689,"Most of what you assumed in your question is already implied in the game--that his Relic Fragment was found on the beach one day while he was brooding, that he had already attempted to join the Guild several times prior to finding the Relic Fragment and failed because he was too timid, etc. So yes, those two assumptions, at least, are true. After all, there's nowhere else in Treasure Town to find something washed ashore, and he'd be too inexperienced at the time to go too far out of town because of the plethora of Mystery Dungeons outside it.

As much as the PMD games like to spell everything out for its audience--*especially* the Explorers games--even those have some sense of subtlety in them in its dialogue, and everything I said above is basically just that. Them building a character through implications rather than direct exposition.

The flag I don't remember, though. It's been sometime since I've played Explorers, but that's a really good headcanon to get behind.

*How* your partner got ahold of the Relic Fragment in the first place, however, has multiple interpretations.

Before Sky came out, people mainly believed these two interpretations:

* Many figured the Relic Fragment just drifted along the beach and chose him by chance or destiny. Basically the stuff the game already tells you. That your partner was picked for no reason and the fragment just ""knew"" he'd be the one to help save the world.

* Others said that it was Dialga who sent the Relic Fragment from the Hidden Land, as a last-ditch attempt at getting someone to help save the world before he would start to go insane and lose his ability to think rationally.

Once Sky came out, however, most people believed these two interpretations:

* When Bidoof asked for a wish from Jirachi in Special Episode 1, many believed that Jirachi *actually* granted his wish (instead of doing nothing and simply giving him encouraging words) and caused the Relic Fragment to come to your partner as a result, causing him to eventually meet the hero and gain the courage to join the Guild and trigger the events of the entire game.

* Others said that, because of what happened in Special Episode 5, it was Arceus specifically who chose your partner and sent the Relic Fragment to him. Since he helped save the future and stopped all the Pokémon in it from being erased from history, people figured the guy just doesn't like being directly involved in worldly affairs, and prefers helping out indirectly, unless a threat appears that's so big that he has to step in, like [spoilers](#s ""Dark Matter"").

But what I want to know more about is your partner's past. Why is he living alone? Does he have a family? Prior friends? How did he get into Treasure Town? Did he always live in Sharpedo Bluff?

When Grovyle sacrifices himself, your partner says something along the lines of, ""'Though the parting hurts'... I know how that feels. I think I know what Grovyle meant when he said those words... He meant that he felt sad having to leave you.""

The ""I know how that feels"" (or whatever exact quote it was that's similar) is what gets to me. He seems to imply he's had to go through other partings in the past. What partings were they? With whom? And when?

None of this is answered, implied, or elaborated on; just left to the imagination for the player.

What I liked about Gates to Infinity's partner is that it provided more insight and development into your partner and didn't leave it needlessly vague. It didn't spell out too much or make everything too obvious with him, not did it make things needlessly vague and explained just enough for us to get the gist of his character.

Explorers didn't do that as much.",2016-03-10 06:04:18+00:00,d0uf9s3,1.0,t3_49s6h5,1533.0,MysteryDungeon

And as for the LP commentary, you bring up some good counter-points as well. Now that you mention it, there aren't many other good options out there to skip all the excess gameplay-related fluff in between all the dialogue. Usually editing it out *does* in fact make the story look a bit choppy (i.e. ZeldaDungeon's fandub project of Skyward Sword, which was also good in its own right, but suffered from said awkward cuts as well), and staying silent or having each VA roleplay their way through each dungeon brings its own slew of potential problems.

Even the little things, like using Beheeyem's in-game cry in place of them saying ""Behee!"", the running sound effects added when Charmander runs away from the Beheeyem, the panting noises he makes when his model is still animated doing such even though another character is speaking, and having that filter on Deoxys's voice, I really appreciate! I love when people focus on details like that!

While I imagined Nuzleaf's voice to be more higher-pitched and somewhat campy, the person you cast handled the voice a bit deeper and grittier... I never would've imagined him to sound so badass! I grew to love it right away.

And your voice for Charmander is good. It actually sounds like the type of voice and delivery TPCi commonly used when they dubbed the PMD specials for the first three games. 

I heard the auditions for many of the other characters as well--and I can't wait to hear them! Other characters' voices are also far from what I imagined, but I know I'll come to love them soon enough. 

Chikorita's voice especially is what I'm looking forward to. Her VA, along with Nuzleaf's, is actually really, really good.

Though if I can offer a few points of criticism (or maybe just a suggestion), I would've loved to see you play with the different options you have in this game, since it gives you some pretty humorous dialogue at times. Like, if you had said 'no' after beating Lush Forest, Nuzleaf would've gotten on his hands and knees and begged you to come along with him, saying he was in the wrong leaving you out alone like that.

The game never gives you an actual choice when it comes to these things, so you'll have to pick the ""proper"" option regardless, so there isn't much to lose.

But if everyone's lines are already pre-recorded, that's fine! It's not exactly necessary that those extra lines of dialogue need to be recorded. Just an idea. This project is already off to an amazing start regardless.

I'm not sure how I feel about you skipping some of the tutorial dialogue, though. I understand anyone who's played a PMD game before will already know all of this, but Nuzleaf's not the only character who drones on about tutorials. There's also Watchog and Ampharos that do that later... And I guess having a few lines skipped just messes with my need for consistency.

The LP commentary is also a little awkward, but that's just something I'll have to get used to on my end.

But those are all just really minor nitpicks! It shouldn't matter when compared to the rest of the project! Keep it up! I can't wait for the next part! I love how perfectly you paced this first part!

And now I'm curious. Will you call the money in this game ""Poké"", to keep consistent with all the previous PMD games, or will you call it something else, like ""money"" or ""gold""? I've noticed Super doesn't call the money in the game anything at all, and just uses the symbol when talking about it, and both placeholder words (""money"" and ""gold"") still work well grammatically, so it got me wondering.",2016-03-09 19:18:29+00:00,d0tpg46,1.0,t3_49p7vb,5159.0,MysteryDungeon

694,"Yeah, I had a feeling this might cause a few arguments. Hope other people read the first paragraph in the post, too.

I get the feeling Explorers wouldn't be as over-praised as it is if Sky didn't come in and make Time/Darkness 100% better in nearly every way. I love the Explorers games, especially Sky, but the changes and additions Sky made gave its gameplay and characters so much of an extra cushion to fall back on...that it makes all the other games hard to compare to, because the other games don't have that extra cushion.

Gates had DLC, but none of it was story-related. And Super's probably not going to have any. So Special Episodes are sadly unlikely.

Which is why I have to praise Super for writing such a tightly-written story with what little it had, not relying on future releases of the same story or extra DLC releases to improve its characters. Its cast was solid as is, and the majority of Super's cast don't exactly need Special Episodes to be made better, unlike Explorer's (though I would absolutely *LOVE* Special Episodes for Super regardless).

And as for what you analyzed about how the Guild and Society run... You're right. The Guild hires Pokémon so they can learn and graduate so they can stand up on their own; places like the Expedition Society would be where Pokémon who are *already* competent at exploring would go to if they wanted a job. Which is why not every Pokémon in the Guild is necessarily the best at what they do.

So in a way, the Wigglytuff's Guild has combined elements of both Serene Village's school *and* Lively Town's Expedition Society. 

But that still doesn't excuse the plain bad writing at certain areas of the game. Not noticing the giant, inconspicuous Drought Stone from base camp, not immediately antagonizing Dusknoir for clearly (dragging and announcing that he's dragging) you into the future, the other members (besides Bidoof, Wigglytuff, and Chatot) not contributing *at all* in any way, etc.",2016-03-07 03:59:48+00:00,d0qdyez,2.0,t1_d0qcqzc,2183.0,MysteryDungeon

702,"I wouldn't say PSMD is dumbed down compared to the previous games. From what I remember, it's the only PMD game to use the words ""die"" and ""death"" without sugarcoating it 100% of the time. It still sugarcoats certain things, don't get me wrong--just not as much as the other games.

* Explorers, for example, kept using ""disappear"", which makes sense SOME of the time, because [spoilers](#s ""you and a few other characters would literally just disappear and be erased from history""), but they still use that word in place of the word ""die"" as well, no matter the situation. It bugged me a little.

* Gates did the same thing, not just with death, but with love as well. And boy did they really like to avoid using and dancing around the words ""crush"" and ""love"" a *lot*. Sure, I guess you could take everyone's English text literally and assume they everyone wanted to be ""friends"" with [spoilers](#s ""Virizion""), but with the way she was portrayed, the hearts in everyone's eyes, and the constant blushing and stuttering? I like the idea of having solely-platonic opposite-sex friendships in media, but the way Gates handled it 90% of the time made it look like anything but. It did it fine with [spoilers](#s ""Umbreon and Espeon""), though.

* And looking back, Rescue Team's story was pretty silly from the start. Team 'Meanies'? Them [spoilers](#s ""thinking stealing your mail and recruiting a Metapod will bring them a large step closer toward world domination? Two rookie kids surpassing the strongest Rescue Team in just a couple in-game months?"") 

I love the PMD series, and each and every game in it *does* have many mature undertones, but at the end of the day, they're all still blatantly kids' games, regardless of their difficulty, how dark their stories gets, etc. But that won't stop me from continuing to enjoy them as an adult.

Er, but to answer your question, then yes! PSMD is definitely worth getting. The consensus finds it better than Gates and Rescue Team but below Explorers in terms of both gameplay *and* story.

705,"That does sound interesting, but if the entire PMD world is meant to be some kind of dimension where all Pokémon inside Poké Balls are meant to live, how would you explain the wild Pokémon that live inside dungeons? Or if a Pokémon is constantly sent out of their Poké Ball for battle, play, or food/water from their Trainer? 

And what about the Pokémon that never seem to leave the Pokémon world and spend every waking day living their daily lives there? Are they just Pokémon that never leave their Poké Balls? Or are they just Pokémon that somehow automatically live in this Poké Ball dimension?

And the legendaries that live here? Are they just legendaries many Trainers caught in-game, if we're going by the gameplay-based route?

But Gates' take on the human world seems to be different; Gates *really* drives it home that the Pokémon you play as in that game is literally you, in real life, *especially* near the end of the game.

710,"Interesting! You definitely bring up some interesting points. I didn't have the Hidden Land and Buried Relic in mind at all when PSMD brought up the ancient past, but since PSMD is meant to be *the* game that ties everything and everyone together, it makes sense.

But now it begs the question as to what happened to the humans in said ancient past...

The Decrepit Lab was said to be built by humans...and since the player in Explorers was implied to be specifically from the PMD world from the start, I guess that could mean that the PMD world used to be inhabited by both humans *and* Pokémon, much like the main series games?

... But then some cataclysmic event, environmental conditions, or boundaries of time and space either wiped them all out or sent them to a different world.

Whether it was Dark Matter, the laws of the universe that Hydreigon abided by so strictly, or some strange effects of being in the PMD world for too long that wiped out all the humans is yet to be seen.

In Gates, Hydreigon says that humans who stay in the PMD world for too long end up causing a distortion that may very well wipe out everything...while in Explorers, Palkia ends up believing the exact same thing, until he looks into it and realizes the distortion the player makes is too small and insignificant to matter. 

Hydreigon himself is also disproven when the player's friends still remember him despite the laws of the universe dictating they would forget him. But thanks to Palkia's insight in Explorers, maybe it *wasn't* the power of friendship that caused the cast of Gates to remember you, but rather it was a complete misunderstanding because Hydreigon failed to properly read up on his ""Voice of Life: How to Deal with Humans in Your World"" handbook.

... Looking at this now, I feel as if I stawman'd this entire comment by almost changing the subject entirely. My bad! I do agree that hints of the ancient past *are* in fact more-than-present in the other games. I really like your insight on Entercards and Ley Lines, too!

Maybe that image of Mew drawn in the Hidden Highlands could now be seen as foreshadowing for Super. xD

OH! NOT TO MENTION--the *footrunes*! In Explorers, Grovyle and your partner call them that, but in Super, all the characters simply refer to it as ""ancient foot-shaped writing"" instead, which is just a mouthful to say. The texts on the Hidden Highland are written in footrunes, and Grovyle had done some studying on it to the point he could read it fluently! Apparently more studying than Mawile was able to do.

Gameplay-wise, it's really easy. The text speed is slower than that of all the other PMD games, and the constantly-zoomed in screen might be a bit awkward to look at, as would the lack of hunger and plethora of OP, game-breaking Orbs that make everything a breeze, but once you get used to the game being a cakewalk (albeit, a somewhat slow-paced, grind-y cakewalk), you'll start to enjoy the game for what it is.

But I guess it's somewhat justified to add onto the shock value of having your character speak out loud to your partner for the very first time right when you're about to disappear.

Gates does it less, and Super doesn't do it nearly as often. Your character will still think out his peace in his head, and then do some odd talking motion afterward, but this is later subverted somewhat as the story goes on.

They're not all that great, at least when compared to items like the Golden Mask that increase recruitment percentages even *higher* for *all* types of Pokémon rather than just *one* at a time.

In Time/Darkness, the Seven Treasures missions were only available via Wonder Mail codes you had to look up online or find from some official source at the time. I remember looking them all up on Serebii when I was kid back when those two games first came out.

In Sky, they also have their own Wonder Mail Codes, but you don't really need them now because they made the missions easier to get, as they're now accessible in-game once you unlock the Secret Rank from Scizor during the post-game.

731,"*fites you* xD

See, this is why I'd prefer it if GTI was a book, visual novel, anime series, movie, ANYTHING but a game. Otherwise I'd appreciate it more.

I do like Gates' story, but you have to acknowledge that it's a *game*, and as a game, and from a purely gameplay-centric standpoint, its faults in its gameplay far outweighed the positives it introduced, which just makes it not worth the trouble of going through for many players. 

If GTI was given a remake in the far, far future and had gameplay as good as Super's, I'd love it! But it doesn't have one and probably won't get one. The gameplay is mainly why Gates gets so much hate, and this is without mentioning the story at all.

I remember you admitting in a video that you haven't played any of the PMD games, at least not to completion. So I'd say it isn't exactly fair for you to praise GTI as a video game...since you only saw its story and *read up* on a lot of its gameplay elements rather than *experiencing* them. There's nothing wrong with not being able to play the games, but since you haven't played them, it's best to judge them as overall stories. After all, you went through all the games as if they were non-interactive visual novels rather than actual games.

A game with a style like PMD's can only be good as a game if both its gameplay features AND its storyline is good. If one or the other ends up bad, then it fails as a game, because the players immersed in it will be discouraged to go further one way or another. But people *watching* it--via an LP on YouTube or otherwise--have the freedom to not go through all that and get to skip any parts they don't like.

And whatever problems or words of praise people have with the story are *mainly* subjective. I love Gates' story, but I'd argue that even *that* has a few problems here and there. But most people hate Gates for the majority of the gameplay changes it made. And I have to agree with some of those complaints. :L",2016-02-24 05:40:31+00:00,d0bn9fo,3.0,t1_d0bhguo,9830.0,MysteryDungeon

735,"After the post-game storyline, you're free to use any Pokémon you want in any dungeon you want, regardless of whether it's your hero and partner. Even the ones with legendaries' and short cutscenes. Your hero and partner aren't necessary for anything anymore.

I still use my hero and partner often out of personal attachment, though. And Espurr as a third member if she's not on break. 

You're free to use your vitamins on whoever you want--the post-game is absolutely brutal if you don't 'roid up, because relying on level-ups alone to get strong enough to beat some of these dungeons and bosses...will only end in having you grind for a really long time.

You can either buff up your hero and partner as much as you'd like, so you won't have to grind as much (as well as any other weaker Pokémon you might like), or you might want to be strategic and buff up strong Pokémon that can help clear dungeons a lot easier (namely those with spread moves like Heat Wave or ranged moves like Ice Beam), like Charizard or Lanturn, especially since some dungeons--and legendary boss battles--are absolutely BRUTAL.

Evolving doesn't increase your stats at all, [spoilers](#s ""unlike your Harmony Scarf Evolutions""). It *might* increase stat raises through level-ups, but it's really not worth it considering it'll only drastically increase the amount of EXP you need to level up.

So I'd say evolving your hero and partner isn't the best idea until you've done everything you wanted to do with them. Or if you just really like the aesthetic change.

Evolving your other recruits is fair game, though! Especially since the game gives you multiples of several Pokémon, so you can still befriend 'em all while still having freedom to evolve certain Pokémon you might like.",2016-02-23 20:16:40+00:00,d0b01hd,1.0,t3_478f9k,1422.0,MysteryDungeon

742,"Desperation (the unused track) is amazing! It's a shame it was never used in the game. Maybe it could've been used to elaborate Munna's backstory and why she and her henchmen feel the same way they do? Either way, I actually like it a bit more than all the other variations of this track that made it to the final game.

Fear (also an unused track) is also pretty chilling. It shares a similar sound in the background that is also present in the beginning of Kyurem's Battle of Destiny, meaning it might have been planned to play in those few seconds before Kyurem Approaching plays when he jumps you at the end of Scorching Desert...but it didn't play at all. Wonder why they scrapped it. It's such a short track as it is. But I guess the foreboding music cues would take away from the surprise of having Kyurem jump you out of nowhere, which I understand. 

Hazy Pass is also really great. It meshed really well with a remix of Carpenter of Post Town that I heard, but even then it's amazing as its own track.

And since Holehills is a bit of an overrated track, I'm gonna be that guy and say I also love Illusory Holehills.~

Celebration of Peace is also *definitely* worth listening to! I love how it incorporates parts of Post Town's theme in it. It's also pretty long for a cutscene track, being two and a half minutes long, and I love how upbeat and victorious this theme sounds. I just hate that I have to grind all the way to Perfect Rank in Gates to have this play in Music Paradise. 

99,999 points? Really? When I can only take one job at a time? As much as I loved this theme and wanted this to play in my Paradise, it wasn't worth the effort. I just loaded up the game for the first time in years and I still need 41,929 points to the last rank. Ugh. This is why I stopped playing the game after *one* year. Two months were spent completing the main story, and the rest was spent grinding. And grinding. And grinding. Grinding materials for Paradise, grinding levels, grinding rank points, ever so slowly...for really lackluster rewards...with no new dialogue from any of the characters I've come to like... And it stopped being fun *very* quickly. 

It felt like a chore. Fighting legendary Pokémon wasn't very exciting, either, since it's just an excuse for you to waste all the Reviver Seeds you've grown for a really *ordinary* reward you could get by doing any other mission. And recruiting them is supposed to be half the fun, but you can't even do that! The fights are a decent challenge, sure, but when you get practically nothing out of it and no one acknowledges it, what's the point? The other games had very few NPCs acknowledging feats like that, too, but at least there were *some*. And the fact that said legendary Pokémon would eventually fight alongside you made up for that.

Sorry. This ended up turning into a rant about Gates. My bad. xD I *really* wanted to like this game. I really did.",2016-02-23 16:57:01+00:00,d0aqyp6,1.0,t3_476n6k,11346.0,MysteryDungeon
743,"Not really. Even in Explorers a lot of Pokémon are just stated to be ""extremely territorial"", like the Luxray/Manectric tribe you fight in Amp Plains. 

Some Pokémon *have* started to go mad because of time stopping, but it's a minuscule amount compared to the amount of Pokémon that have gone mad in the future. And how would you explain the Pokémon in dungeons after you beat Primal Dialga, and Darkrai, even?

In Rescue Team the majority of the Pokémon in dungeons were also extremely territorial; some are just irrational because they're either paranoid, fed up, or directly affected by the excess natural disasters (i.e. Skarmory and Groudon), and the reason why most of the legendary Pokémon (i.e. the legendary birds) fight you is because you're trespassing into their home (along with the prior reason). 

Generic enemy Pokémon all feel the same way in one way or another. Armaldo even makes fun of how often the ""too overly-territorial to talk things out"" trope is used in this series in Explorers of Sky's second Special Episode.

Some Pokémon *have* turned to a life of crime because of these occurrences, but this just applies to outlaws. If it counted for generic enemy Pokémon, why would some eventually join you once you beat them up enough times?

779,"I love the new recruitment system! The old RNG-based system wasn't bad per say, but I disliked how the stronger you got, you either had to deal with tens and tens of the same weaker Pokémon asking you to join your team every time you defeated one, or you had to rely on luck regardless when it came to recruiting Kecleon and certain legendary Pokémon.

And when it came to legendary Pokémon, I always had the worst luck, especially in Rescue Team, having to go through dungeons like Western Cave and Silver Trench at least twice to get Mewtwo and Lugia. Not to mention the several runs I made through Buried Relic, only ever getting the chance to see Mew ONCE after all those runs, only for it to not join my team. As a Level 100 Friend Bow Venusaur. It was ridiculous.

And from a storyline perspective, the RNG-based recruitment system just didn't make sense 90% of the time. How does barging into a Pokémon's territory and beating them up a certain number of times get them to suddenly like you? With certain legendary Pokémon, it made sense, since most of them were impressed with you for going this far just to see them and wanted to test your strength in battle, but as for most ordinary dungeon Pokémon, and Kecleon? That's some pretty skewed logic. Especially when you have to rob a Kecleon Shop and go on a murderous rampage until one Kecleon decides to join you in your life of crime!

PSMD deviated from the norm of ""kill/steal and befriend"" by having you actually bond and do good deeds for each Pokémon you met before they joined your team, which was a much more realistic approach to expanding your team, and I liked that.

I also like how PSMD's team system works; unlike in past games, the Pokémon you recruit don't necessarily DIRECTLY work under you 24/7 like in past games. They all have lives of their own and other obligations to tend to, and they don't necessarily join YOUR team, but rather they agree to indirectly help you explore new dungeons while still managing their own teams as well. If that wording makes sense.

Team Rocket, Teams Magma and Aqua, Team Galactic, Team Plasma, and Team Flare all put their respective regions and its inhabitants through a ton of strife, some of them even going so far as to publicly trying to end the world or reshape the world in their image.

Yet rarely anyone seems to bring any of this up in other regions, let alone the region these events already happened in.

PSMD follows that same mentality.

Like, how did Temporal Tower get sabotaged in the first place? How did time go out of whack? Primal Dialga was just a result of collateral damage, and Dusknoir and the Sableye were only working under him because they wanted to survive, not because they wanted to screw the world over.

And who was the one who attacked you and Grovyle when you were about to head into the Dimensional Hole into the past? And how did you gain amnesia?

None of those questions were answered at all in the main story, and seeing Darkrai start to get desperate to the point he decides to stop planning from the shadows and start using a more direct approach in taking you out showed how hellbent he was in killing you, especially after ruining his plans of causing the planet's paralysis. Tricking Palkia into trying to kill you, trying to kill you disguised as Cresselia, trying to convince you and your partner to kill yourselves, deciding to use his own powers to give people endless nightmares rather than using the power of another Pokémon...

Lanturn works pretty similarly, with moves like Signal Beam and Discharge to work with as well, AND has a better typing.

I might sound a bit biased here, but Espurr (one of my personal favorite Pokémon) is also a good choice imo. Psybeam works for range, and she can learn a lot of moves that hit multiple adjacent opponents, like Thunderbolt and Dark Pulse.

Pokémon with ranged moves, move-clearing moves, or moves that can hit multiple opponents are always good. Especially go for Pokémon with at least one type immunity, for dungeons that have varied Pokémon types.

Charizard, for example, has access to Heat Wave--as well as an immunity to Pokémon that like to sweep your party with Earth Power, Earthquake, Magnitude, etc. makes certain dungeons a lot easier to progress through. It also helps wear down Monster Houses, and since no type is immune to Fire, any and every Pokémon can get hit by it (something Discharge doesn't have the luxury of having in PSMD).

Gengar wrecks house, too, being just as good as he is in the main series games. He shares Charizard's Ground immunity, but he's immune to Normal and Fighting, too.

That's also a really ambitious project you have planned there, and I respect that. It's always been a dream of mine to see the PMD series decently fandubbed, using game footage, animation, or otherwise.

I guess you're aiming for something along the lines of what ZeldaUniverseTV did with Skyward Sword? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQy-Pk4OuI

... Only with Let's Play commentary outside cutscenes, I guess?

That's a pretty daunting task. Good fan voice actors are hard to come by--especially ones with good mic equipment and knowledge of sound mixing. Let alone if they have any mic equipment at all. The stuff can be expensive! Along with the proper set-up for it to work... And the director being good at casting and giving good direction not just hiring anyone they get willy-nilly or saying everything in one rough take. And let's not forget the voice filters or effects some characters might need... 

Though I'd say TheKingNappy and GameBoyLuke's LP of the game did a pretty good job without any of that, even if it WAS just the two of them to voice everyone. Some of their voices got pretty imaginative with some of the characters...while Marriland was able to get multiple people, and had the editing skills to use the right filters and effects for certain characters. 

I'm interested in participating and maybe auditioning for Nuzleaf and see if I'm any good, but I don't know if I have said equipment myself.

I've seen plenty of fandubs, on YouTube or otherwise, as well as see many fan attempts made by people on Behind the Voice Actors (like this one: http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/members/Robin1234/casting-call/Pokmon-Mystery-Dungeon-Gates-To-Inifinity/), and there are some that are good...and many that aren't so good.

Fandubs are a really iffy thing to attempt and put together. So I wish you best of luck and hope you know what you're in for if you're aiming for something professional!

Honestly, I'd say just turning the whole project into an attempt at voice acting the entire game might make things a bit simpler, but then again, that would also require a lot of editing to make everything flow better, which was something even big fan groups like ZeldaUniverseTV don't always hit the mark on.",2016-02-19 05:41:18+00:00,d05kalt,1.0,t3_46ikm7,9472.0,MysteryDungeon

I feel they went all out on this one--adding all currently-known Pokémon at the time, appealing to nostalgia with all the character cameos, and adding all the past games' continents--to try to win back the crowd who left after not liking Gates to Infinity. And maybe to subtly celebrate PMD's 10th anniversary?

To me, a series can only run for so long before it starts to get stale or naturally decline in quality. I'd rather a series like this end on a high note than drag on because of popularity to the point everyone starts bashing it.

People rag on CoD for being ""the same thing"" nearly every year, yet some seem to overlook this about series like Pokémon, Zelda, or Mario, and even some of their spin-offs.

I love the PMD series, too, and I'd be sad to see it end--but considering all the stops this game pulled compared to all the ones prior, this could very well be the last one in the series (or at least, the last one unless Spike Chunsoft decides they've won back enough people to keep going).

Pokémon was originally going to end at Gen 2, one of the highest points in the series--all the Pokémon we've known so far, all the regions we've known so far, the most content, double the Gym leaders, character cameos from the past games... Sound familiar? 

And then Gen 3 came because of how popular the series was at the time, but when R/S came out, the series suffered a massive decline from post-phenomenon dysphoria, but that's beside the point.

If the PMD series were to continue, I'd say they should release the series every OTHER generation rather than EVERY generation.

They're status as a human is made out to be so special to the point that they even have their own special ability that most Pokémon don't possess (the Dimensional Scream), showing how rare or nonexistent (practically extinct, more like it) they are.

* In GtI, Hydreigon sends a bunch of humans to the PMD world. And in SMD, you were sent to this world multiple times. So events like these are probably why everyone seems to know what a human is. In Super, Jirachi seems to know better, for example.

* However, the evidence of ACTUAL human life in the PMD world seems to have been recorded so long ago that most other Pokémon regard them as mythical creatures. A few hundred years, at least. The player character in PMD2 doesn't count because of the majority of the population had gone corrupt, the world in too many shambles for anyone to really care much about recording history when survival was everyone's top priority. Plus, you and Grovyle had been doing most of your actions in secrecy, in an attempt to save the world in a way that wouldn't attract Primal Dialga's and his henchmen's attention.

* But what cataclysmic event wiped all the humans out, causing the Pokémon to take over and gain the intelligence to build all their own civilizations and act on their own?

Though as for Kyurem, now that I think back, I think a small part of him actually WANTED you and your partner to live and defy his vision of the future, much like how Lysandre felt the same way toward Calem/Serena by constantly ""testing"" them and conveniently telling then exactly what to do to try to stop him, even though he's come so far in his plans for genocide.

Kyurem isn't completely cold and heartless, even after all the horrible things he's done and even through his firm stance in his believes. He's just doing what he thinks is right, and maybe he couldn't help but feel a twinge of pity, mercy, and admiration for how far your partner went to protecting you? And the fact that he must have separated and hurt many others must have slowly and gradually added to that guilt as well.

Him deciding to let you and your partner pass without any further resistance after being beaten in battle, as well as him saving everyone when the Glacier Palace collapses (and after he somehow shows up in everyone's dreams?) also shows that he must have had an inner light of hope within him as well, much like Munna and the others did when they changes sides thanks to your partner's pep talk (even if it WAS more abruptly than I would've liked).

I do like your Super Mario RPG/Paper Mario approach with the use of partners/assist characters in your party.

His relationship with Deoxys also seems to have amended over the years after Rescue Team as well.

Gengar settling down in Baram Town, accepting that Medicham and Gardevoir have made their own team together and deciding to casually cause mischief on his own with his new friends rather than aim for world domination again with some incarnation of Team Meanies also brought warmth to my heart, and brought a bit more closure to his story in Rescue Team.

I also wouldn't say each quest is meaningless; each quest in the previous games takes place on different continents in PSMD, meaning the areas from the previous games are still pretty isolated form each other. Rescue Team's threat centering around the Air Continent, Explorers' on the Grass Continent, etc. So every danger was their own for the CONTINENT, rather than the world, with the Pokémon of their respective continents doing something about the current threat affecting it while the rest of the world remains oblivious because they aren't AS affected by it.

... If that wording makes sense.

It's like how each region in the main series games has their own region with its own evil team wanting to destroy the world in some way, shape, or form. They all had plans that could've potentially permanently changed the world, yet their respective threats only centered around the specific regions they came from, and are rarely mentioned or talked about in other regions. That same mentality is applied in PSMD.

Dark Matter also felt like it fit into the world just fine, because non-Pokémon entities have been in the games since Rescue Team--like the Judge of Darkness, Voices of Life, and Bittercold. As well as whatever voice allows Pokémon to evolve in Luminous Cave and Luminous Spring.

And Dark Matter being as strong as it is, is justified with the explanation that it's been building himself back up again since his last defeat in the ancient past. Though the game didn't do a very good job at justifying Dark Matter's motives; not many Pokémon in PSMD were very ""bad"", per say. Gates did a better job at that when building up the Bittercold.

853,"Eh. He seemed to care about Medicham and Ekans. I was just covering how much he didn't care because you mentioned that the whole fugitive arc was a result of Gengar trying to defend himself out of self-preservation. It really wasn't.

You've got a point there about the repeated flashbacks, though. They should've saved them all for the scene at the end where your partner recalls all the memories he had with you on the beach. Had they not already used them all to death several times prior, the scene would've been more impactful.

And Explorers does have a lot of un-needed fluff, I can't deny that (the forced tutorial section with Chatot for the first hour of the game is grating), and if its side characters were actually useful and worthwhile to the plot, then I'd excuse it, but they weren't. Super fixed that a bit, but not to a great extent.

As for button mashing through the text... Just holding B speeds things up a bit.

And your take on legendaries? I guess I can buy that. But I always liked to imagine most of them being stronger than the average Pokémon. Which is part of why they're so respected. Which is exactly the image Super paints for everyone and actually does it well, imo. Rescue Team just wasn't consistent with how strong they wanted their legendaries to be, and that bugged me just a tiny bit.",2016-02-09 17:46:43+00:00,cztnnrw,8.0,t1_cztalxe,27915.0,MysteryDungeon
854,"See, but the thing was, no one seemed to know Gengar was even human. As far as we know, you were the only one he confided that to, and that was only in the post-game.

You, the player, didn't seem to mind telling your partner and the townspeople you were a human, and you didn't /have/ to tell everyone, ""Hey, I might be the human from the Ninetails Legend and I also might be the one causing the natural disasters that have caused everyone trouble."" Gengar did that and overdramatized the situation so you and your partner could get killed.

If even one of the townspeople already knew Gengar was a human, they probably would've already started suspecting him the moment people started worrying about the Ninetails Legend in the first place. So he wasn't afraid of him being made the culprit. Medicham and Ekans were in on the plan too; they all just wanted to be made the town heroes so everyone would do whatever they said.

Gengar also tried to stop everyone from trying to rescue Team ACT and stop Groudon from potentially destroying the world. He tried to bring everyone's spirits down and just let things be. He didn't care about the state of the world, nor did he seem to care if anyone else died as a result of the natural disasters that plagued it.

Not to mention, he thought stealing your mail was going to get him ""one step closer to world domination"".

If all that doesn't define him as an ass, I don't know what does. He only came to you for help in the post-game because he overheard Gardevoir talking about him, causing him to feel bad for his actions against HER. It was only because of her speech at the end of the game that caused him to soften up a bit. Anything before that moment? He was a heartless bastard.

And see, Explorers fixed a lot of the power creep issues that Rescue Team had because the main story had you fight lesser legendaries, like Mesprit. Groudon was also an illusion in the main story. And by the time you had to square against Dialga, you only had to because Grovyle sacrificed himself to stop Dusknoir and the future Primal Dialga from interfering with the past. NOT because you and your partner suddenly became the strongest Pokémon around for the job like Rescue Team hypes you up to be for some reason. Grovyle, Dusknoir, and Celebi also had the power to stop Primal Dialga.

You were partnered with Grovyle from the start to change history, and now you were going to fix it.

And Team Skull? They were asses as well. Only difference is, they're more stupid than heartless and don't have a tragic backstory to make you sympathize with them.

Gates also fixed the power creep problem COMPLETELY, by having you, a human, be the only one who could stand up to the Bittercold, making your role as a human SPECIFICALLY actually mean something. Kyurem was also justifiably beaten because he spends the most time hanging around the Bittercold, having probably sapped a lot of his energy just by standing near the thing waiting for you to show up.

Gardevoir called you to stop a falling meteor that was messing with the Earth as it got closer and closer to crash there. But event after event kept interrupting her from telling you the whole story right away.

Like Pokémon asking you to rescue them. And Gengar trying to frame you and have everyone kill you because he's an ass.

I also thought the end was rushed. Team ACT spent several days getting through Magma Cavern to fight Groudon. All the other Pokémon did the same and didn't even /make it/ to Groudon. 

All these Pokémon are much older and experienced than you and your partner could dream. The two of you have only been at this for a few in-game months, yet they're somehow able to become strong enough to take down legendary Pokémon in such a short amount of time like it's no big deal.

Them surpassing Team ACT just like that also bugged me. It felt like such a contrived way to make sure you were the one that had to go up to Sky Tower and no one else.",2016-02-09 08:21:41+00:00,czt95n5,4.0,t1_czt60pg,9290.0,MysteryDungeon

I was still kinda surprised, though--just not as much as I could've been. Wish I was able to avoid spoilers the whole way through, but oh well. Plenty of the other games' moments surprised me, though.

Explorers' and Gates' good-byes were a lot sadder to me. The scenes that played ""Memories Returned"" and ""The Frism"" broke me. 

Rescue Team's was mainly sad when I was a kid playing through it for the first time (when the game first came out) because I wasn't expecting such a bittersweet ending, and at the time, I had never played any other games with sad endings before. I bawled my eyes out and totally bought the whole ""if you believe really hard, you'll come back"" message the game gave you by the credits.",2016-02-09 07:26:33+00:00,czt8792,1.0,t3_44v3kj,8311.0,MysteryDungeon

Why not have them interact with you a bit more and give all these challenging new dungeons some weight to them?

Rescue Team's post-game story was pretty bare as well, and /also/ left you on a trip down completionist road once the few story events it had were done, but it still gave each and every irrelevant legendary in the game at least some kind of cutscene or mini arc to show that they still had a pretty big impact on the world (i.e. the Three Fields/My. Faraway arc, Silver Trench arc, Western Cave arc, etc.). RT just did a bad job at making any of these arcs feel worthwhile doing, because no one seemed to acknowledge YOUR actions any further once you beat the main story. Even your partner just dips and heads back to their Friend Area to become a regular Pokémon.

858,"Same here! Espurr and Chandelure are two of my favorite Pokémon, and while I was a tiny bit disappointed with Chandelure's minor part in Gates, [spoilers](#s ""the gang of Litwick that unintentionally helped foreshadow Dark Matter"") and Espurr's role in SPMD more than made up for that. She was definitely my favorite character in the game.

Also, a confession--I actually believed [spoilers](#s ""Espurr's façade and thought she had actually betrayed us. Felt a little bad when she yelled at us for doubting her, lol."")  

Anyway! My whole headcanon on this revolves around how the male Meowstic connects to Espurr in the Connection Orb and how the female Meowstic connects to completely different Pokémon located very, very far from them. I came to the conclusion that the male Meowstic might be related to Espurr somehow because the only Sawsbuck in the game connects to Deerling, is in the same seasonal form as her, and is implied to be her mother thanks to Deerling's mention of her parents earlier in the game.

A more obvious example of implied connections involves the ""confirmation"" that Team Charm's Gardevoir is the same Gardevoir that used to be Gengar's partner when he was a human, because the Connection Orb connects them directly to each other, when none of their in-game dialogue suggests any of this.

The game itself does state that the Connection Orb does connect acquaintances as much as it does friends and loved ones, so the relationships between the Pokémon connected in it don't always have to be very close or constant (i.e. Bidoof and Snover), as long as at least one Pokémon knows the other in some way, no matter how small.

The Meowstics' canon dialogue also seems to indirectly conflict with each other, the male enjoying mischief and the female disliking it, which is where I made up this whole backstory. 

Knowing Espurr, I'd assume she IS pretty apathetic about her whole familial situation, since she doesn't seem to mind being alone, from what we've seen in-game. Like chairinadarkroom mentioned, she [spoilers](#s ""doesn't even seem to care about dying, saying that being sent to the Voidlands would just make things uninteresting for her."") 

Whenever I try to make some kind of theory or fanfiction-esque headcanon, I usually try to justify it with quotes or justifications and assumptions through gameplay mechanics from the source material.

859,"That's fair. I can see where you're coming from there.

When it came to characters, Explorers had more to work with. Time/Darkness not only had a bunch of irrelevant characters to work with when it came to deciding who to write Special Episodes about, but it also had really great characters to expand on as well that weren't given enough elaboration prior.

Super doesn't have that luxury to that same extent. I made a post a while back on here that asked what Special Episodes they would want for all the other PMD games, and while I feel it has the potential for some good Special Episodes (along with the gameplay shorts the Play Nintendo channel's been posting every Friday), its plot still leaves some aspects left to be desired.

As for length, I'd have to disagree and say length doesn't always make the game, but since Explorers took advantage of its post-game by properly establishing more about the story in a meaningful way, you have a point. Super's post-game story, while longer than Gates', was actually worse to me structurally and was rushed to all hell and back near the end.",2016-02-07 02:16:24+00:00,czqmdbp,4.0,t1_czqlc7z,1800.0,MysteryDungeon
860,"I've gotta disagree with you there.

I've also played all four generations of PSMD, and while I have very fond childhood memories with Rescue Team and Explorers (and even some nostalgic memories with Gates, seeing as it's already been nearly three years since that game came out), now that I'm older, I tend to only give credit where credit is due.

The older games' music is still phenomenal even today, and PSMD's remasters of some of the older tracks--as well as many fan remixes of said older tracks--only solidify that.

The stories of each game, however, each have their flaws. 

---Rescue Team's story, looking back now, and while I still love it for what it was, is a rough mess that had a few holes or bothersome moments imo that could only be described as ""rushed"".

Mechanics-wise, Rescue Team is also the roughest, but it's still a pretty easy learning curve to get the hang of and it gets some slack for being the first game in the series. Having to throw your items to use them on your teammates and such were only minor inconveniences at best that would hardly bother anyone if this was their first PMD game. 

Not to mention, RT's post-game threw A LOT at you out of the blue. Traps, HM requirements, 99-floor dungeons, dungeon restrictions, aimless wandering until you hopefully unlock some more story, no clear indication of whether the post-game storyline had completely ended or not, etc. While I liked the freedom it gave me, it felt disorganized and didn't feel as ""complete"" as Explorers' story did because Explorers actually LET YOU KNOW when you were done with the story rather than leaving you in the lurch. 

Rescue Team is a 7/10 to me.

---Explorers' mechanics and storyline improved dramatically, polishing many aspects both gameplay-wise AND plot-wise. Sky even pushed both of those aspects even further with its additional mechanics, story arcs, and Special Episodes.

It overall had a more balanced learning curve as well, introducing traps early on in a more fair way by gradually introducing you to more and more of the more frustrating traps later on in the story (rather than abruptly dumping them all at you at once and having you learn through time, trial, and error, like Rescue Team did). Its main-game dungeons were also at a more reasonable length. 

Story-wise, it improved A LOT on the things Rescue Team did wrong and set the expectations for future PMD games to come. It also established a lot of tropes and traditions that future PMD games would repeat story-wise. 

Explorers is a 9/10 to me.

---Gates, like 5th gen as a whole, took a LOT of risks by changing a lot of the core gameplay, graphics, music, and overall style of the series. With new composers and a new 3D plain to work with, Chunsoft--now partnered with Spike--had pretty big shoes to fill when fans were expecting something similar to RT and Explorers (but mainly Explorers), only to disappoint everybody by bringing ""too many"" new things to the table.

Gameplay-wise, it's a lot more user-friendly, adding more features like allowing you to use L to see ALL your attacks rather than having to go to the menu just to select a different move over and over. I also liked the idea of Companion Mode and having all your recruited Pokémon share EXP so you don't have to waste hours and hours individually grinding anyone that isn't you or your partner if you want to take them out to a dungeon. It made me actually WANT to use a lot more of the Pokémon I recruited rather than leaving them on my list as some kind of trophy for completionists' sake. 

And the idea of upgrading moves the more you used them--while also making PP a more important factor to keep watch of now that your normal attack ONLY does 5 damage--was an interesting concept.

But what I DIDN'T like was the slower text speed, overcompensation of new OP items, the ""dumbing down"" of certain restrictions from previous games (such as the removal of hunger and allowing the use of Orbs in boss battles), and overall the developers making the game almost TOO easy. 

Having unrecruitable large legendaries, the ability to ONLY do ONE mission at a time, and the RIDICULOUS number of points it takes to rank up as a result only to getting lackluster rewards for doing so was also a bad choice.

As for the limited amount of Pokémon you can recruit? That's debatable to me and not something I can really argue for or against, because I have plenty of reasons justifying both.

Now story-wise? Gates was great. Its smaller cast of characters gave them all room to grow, develop, and actually be CONSISTENTLY RELEVANT and IMPORTANT to the story for once. It felt like I was in an ACTUAL team with Pokémon who would each contribute their own part in the plot. This was something I didn't feel in the past games, where ONLY your partner was important and RARELY any other protagonist.

I also like how it took a lot of tropes we've already become accustomed to in the PMD series and flipped them in ways we've never seen before. It also followed Sky's lead of delving into slightly deeper, more real (at least, for a kids' game) topics that made some players empathize with the characters.

But it ALSO suffered a lot of TELLING and NARRATING each character's and story's conflicts rather than SHOWING them, something Explorers did a better job at.

As for the OST... With many new composers at the reins now that some of the older composers had left the staff, they did an AMAZING job with the music. So much so that they even reused a lot of the dungeon themes in Super for its optional, irrelevant dungeons.

Either way, Gates was a solid 6/10 to me. Story is important, but since it's a GAME, /gameplay/ is what makes the game and is supposed to HELP complement the story, not hinder it. But it's far from a disgrace in my eyes.

---Now as for Super, I won't go into as much detail about it as I did with the other games.

PSMD is by far the most polished and user-friendly game to date, with debatably my favorite gameplay mechanics in the series. It's like they took some of the best aspects of each game prior and slapped them onto Super, all while adding many new mechanics of their own. It's great.

Story-wise, it was pretty good. It had its ups and downs, good characters and bad, missed opportunities and overused opportunities, great plot twists and un-need plot twists, but overall, I enjoyed it. And this goes without mentioning the graphics and character fanservice.

Its OST is also pretty spectacular. 8/10. If it ever got the Sky treatment and had Special Episodes and even some minor plot changes, it might even be on par with Explorers of Sky.",2016-02-07 01:16:16+00:00,czqkarm,2.0,t1_czqj05g,2412.0,MysteryDungeon

It's actually funny that you mention suspecting Nuzleaf out of jest. Once I had beaten the game myself, I watched TheKingNappy's playthrough of PSMD, where he also actually jokingly assumed Nuzleaf was the villain right from the start.

In the original R/S/E, they just return their Orbs to Mt. Pyre, disband their teams in shame, and you never hear from them again.

In OR/AS, the two act more like mature adults. Both Maxie and Archie acknowledge that a simple apology won't make up for all the crimes they've committed, yet they try to change regardless.

Both teams still continue to exist, and now work together and act as ACTUAL environmentalist groups. I like how they reformed like that overtime.

In R/S/E, I kind of felt bad for both teams...because the games still made them out to be misguided idealists who just wanted to make the world a better place. Yet the game just writes them off after you, a child, prove to them that their world view is wrong.

OR/AS not only gave them more elaborated backstories, more memorable personalities, and clearer motivations, but they /also/ gave them a more significant part in the story, giving their idealistic, misguided mindsets further expansion rather than just painting them as selfish, shameful, and stereotypical villains.

I've heard some people rag on the first half of the game as a whole for being slow, uneventful, and pointless, which is why I mentioned that that's not really true because it establishes a lot of introductions of the characters, their motivations, and foreshadowing of future events. Like with Dark Matter and Nuzleaf.

During my first run of Explorers when Time/Darkness first came out, it almost felt obvious to me that Dusknoir was the bad guy. Mainly because he 'looked' evil and Ghost-types and the like were almost always treated as such. Not only that, but the player's whole spiel to themselves about Dusknoir's 'faintest of smiles' and Dusknoir's totally-not-suspicious mumbling to himself on the beach felt like a dead giveaway. Along with that really awkward laugh he had until Special Episode 5? Not to mention Dusknoir's aggressiveness toward Grovyle at Crystal Lake; juxtaposed with Grovyle's passive nature and constant apologies toward the Pokémon he attacks. And Dusknoir flat-out lying to everyone when he was about to bring Grovyle back to the future.

But I was still surprised at the betrayal at the time regardless, only because they made up for all those moments with all those times he saved you and helped you out (also because I was 11 at the time). Along with the sappy music that played when he was about to say good-bye to you. I knew it was coming, but the game made me not want to believe my suspicions were true. That, and this was the first betrayal in the PMD series, so it gets credit for that; nowadays it's practically a tradition to have one. If a betrayal similar to how Dusknoir's was written happened in a later game, and Munna's happened first instead, then it would just look even more conspicuous. 

Munna's was great because it took a lot of already-known PMD tropes and flipped them topsy-turvy and all kinds of ways around in ways that we've never seen before. 

And Nuzleaf's was great because you either had to overthink every interaction with him to be suspicious or you had to have 20/20 foresight. I admit, I felt Nuzleaf's actions were just very relaxed parenting, too, especially when your partner and the other schoolkids have an entire discussion about different types of parenting, and Nuzleaf himself gives you a lecture about just that as well, probably to throw you off.

But the fact that Nuzleaf happened to conveniently be that far outside of his home village, only a few feet away from where you woke up and met the Beheeyem? That always felt a bit off to me.

869,"The Rescue Team games are actually some of the hardest games in the PMD series. Super Mystery Dungeon is /about/ as hard as Rescue Team if you're unlucky with RNG or if you're unprepared/don't use your items wisely, so the difficulty curve won't be as hard to deal with if you've already played the first PMD game.

Plus, PSMD provides enough tutorials that explain all the new mechanics of the game, so you're good on that department. But considering you haven't played Explorers of Sky (Time/Darkness are a waste of time because of the amount of content Sky added) or Gates to Infinity, you'll have a lot more to take in. But even if PSMD was someone's /first/ PMD game, it's all still manageable to learn as you go through the story.

PSMD is the most user-friendly PMD game to date when it comes to game mechanics alone, so you no longer have to deal with having to throw your items at your partners to heal them like you had to in Rescue Team, or have to deal with partners with low AI (even with buffed IQ).

Oh, and IQ is gone in PSMD. Your partners have a lot of the common-sense IQ skills already ingrained into their AI (like when it comes to avoiding traps, avoiding sleeping Pokémon, collecting items while still following you around instead of getting lost when you're only 3 tiles away from each other, etc.).

The recruitment system is also different. Rather than relying solely on RNG and percentages by beating up several of the same Pokémon hoping one of them eventually likes you enough to join your team, you recruit Pokémon based on the missions you get. For example, if you accept a job of a Nidorino asking you to escort it to its lost item in a dungeon, that Nidorino joins your team as thanks. Items as mission rewards don't happen /as/ often, but they still exist.

PSMD also has a LOT of character cameos from previous games, some of whom spoil plotlines from the previous PMD games (because PSMD takes place /after/ all the others). You can also recruit them on your team! So if you ever wanted to play as Team Meanies or Absol and Ninetails, you can do just that. But if you're even remotely interested in the other PMD games, you'll have to watch out for spoilers.

The story of PSMD is great. I'm not going to say anything about what the story entails because it's best to go into it /completely/ blind, even without the context the trailers give you. It broke a lot of norms and trends previous PMD games had while also continuously referencing said norms and trends as well in its writing.

Its OST is also phenomenal. Most of the PMD composers that worked on Rescue Team have already left after Explorers of Sky, but the new composers who run the series now still do an amazing job. Bespinben's insight and piano covers on each and every PSMD track he's arranged so far provides more detail into that, though some of his videos show clips of gameplay and descriptions of what happens in the plot, so be careful.

TL;DR - I'd say PSMD is definitely worth buying and its story not only has a lot less holes than Rescue Team's, but its music is still as great as ever.

874,"""They"" traditionally refers to multiple people, which is why I've seen many people debate what words to use when handling fictional characters whose gender is either ambiguous or unstated.

Soul Eater's Crona's gender is unstated, so Crona uses gender-neutral pronouns in the Japanese dub. We lack pronouns that are *truly* gender neutral in English, so the English dub felt they had no other option but to use ""he"" to fit the animation's mouth flaps and have sentences make more sense in context (in case anyone would get confused and assume that ""they"" meant plural).

Though in Undertale, the player character is referred to as ""they"", which actually leaves the possibility that the character is ambiguously male or female, which was the creator's intention. They do have a gender; it's just left ambiguous so the player can immerse themselves in the game no matter what gender they are.

And Undertale is able to get away with using ""they"" because of the context above.

I can assume ""they"" can *also* mean that someone/something has no gender *as well*, but I haven't seen it used in that sense very often.",2016-02-03 19:22:45+00:00,czmlin4,4.0,t1_czmjsbz,2300.0,MysteryDungeon

It was a nice take on how it handled PMD's standard story arcs as a whole; I always thought it was completely unrealistic for some rookie Pokémon who were at the right place and the right time to suddenly be capable of forming their own Rescue or Exploration Team, no questions asked.

And how your partner happened to have a vacant house open just for you that just so happened to suit your EXACT type in Rescue Team? And how the ""world-famous"" Wigglytuff's Guild just allows two rookie kids (who have only gone through one dungeon) to join without even testing their qualifications first? A little too convenient, if you ask me.

What was also completely unrealistic was how said two children were able to beat these unstoppable legendary Pokémon that not even the best of the best teams could beat--teams that were made up of Pokémon both older than you and who had far more experience than you--in Rescue Team. (They fixed this in Explorers-onward, but still.)

In SPMD, having the hero NOT meet your partner the moment you wake up in this world--and having them actually develop and go through more than a few adventures together (and even going through some conflict between themselves) before actually becoming inseparable friends--was a nice breath of fresh air for me.

I also liked the chemistry of the schoolkids and your hero and partner. They all had more than just some verbal tic or catchphrase to their personality (*cough*most-of-Wigglytuff's-Guild*cough*) and were able to work off each other as a team. Especially around the 4th boss.

And having your partner and player progress more realistically as characters instead of being these extremely-talented practically-flawless child prodigies from the start felt nice as well. Not that I really had a major problem with the previous games' writing; it's just the way PSMD takes many changes to the norms the other games set felt more fresh to me.

That, and I actually enjoyed a lot of my elementary-middle school days.

Whether those holes were created because of future Primal Dialga's doing or whether Dusknoir somehow had some kind of ability or device that allowed him to create these holes himself are never revealed.

But! In the post-game, it's revealed Darkrai has the ability to create Dimensional Holes all on his own. His eyes shine bright and one appears for him so he could try to make his getaway into some other random time, as shown at 8:06 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1v_IfrnE5g

Meaning Dusknoir may also have this ability as well, given he made two convenient Dimensional Holes for himself earlier in the game to travel between the past and future. After all, he made both of those Dimensional Holes without any way of contacting Primal Dialga from the past.

As for Primal Dialga being able to comprehend that Dusknoir was an ally, I assume Dusknoir did his best to assert his loyalty to it. Even the most wild of animals can be tamed...somewhat. He even asked Dialga to warp him to the Hidden Highland directly but had no way to return to the future unless he made that Dimensional Hole leading back.

But surely it must have realized that Dusknoir went against him when he saved Grovyle from death. Both Grovyle and Dusknoir have implied they've had many, many squabbles earlier on, meaning Dialga must have met him sometime ago as well and have it conditioned in its mind that Grovyle is the enemy. So yes, it's a tiny bit rational.

Why didn't Dusknoir or Dialga destroy the Passages of Time so Grovyle and his Planetary Investigation Team could never go back to the past?

916,"That's definitely a variation of the theory, but it's a tiny bit more believable, at least. 

The main theory I constantly hear revolves around Red (intentionally or unintentionally) killing Blue's Raticate during their battle at the S.S. Anne. Then Blue left the ship and didn't make it to the Pokémon Center in time. The grave he's standing in front of in Pokémon Tower is his Raticate's grave and he decides to omit his Raticate's death as if it never happened when he meets you there, while using that death as fuel to despise you and get stronger as a Trainer. That, and Oak apparently favoring Red more than Blue also pushed him over the edge and it implies all Blue ever wanted was his grandfather's love.

I don't hate that theory or anything... Its holes just detract me from liking it very much.

Another branch I've heard involves him secretly working for Team Rocket--one variation mentioned on some Pokémon theorist video I ran into a while back and another variation I ran into here earlier--and while I feel its evidence is based on a few too many coincidences, I just really like the idea enough to give it some slack.

918,"I think the theory that Blue's Raticate ""died"" is extremely silly.

Pokémon games never try to paint the main character in a bad light in any way, shape, or form because they're supposed to be /you/. As dark as the series can get at times, they'd never try to make you look like the bad guy in a main series game. They're all mute, personality-less husks for a reason--because Red, Ethan, Brendan, Lucas, Hilbert, Nate, Calem... They're all /you/.

Not only that, but on the S.S. Anne, Blue says he caught over 30 Pokémon. Meaning he has plenty of other Pokémon at his disposal besides the ones in his party--either for PokéDex fodder or for future use to train later.

Remember that Gen 1 was the only gen that actually did everything in its power to make you WANT to complete your PokéDex as if it were an integral part of the game, since Prof. Oak himself asked you do THAT to fulfill his lifelong dream, NOT beat all the Gyms. It's also why your rival would show off how many Pokémon he's caught to you every now and then.

And then cut forward to his Champion battle dialogue. He says, ""While working on my Pokédex, I looked all over for powerful Pokémon! Not only that, I assembled teams that would beat any Pokémon type!"" 

Meaning he most likely just stuffed his Raticate in the PC and substituted it for one of his stronger Pokémon. I mean, hey, an Alakazam, Rhydon, Arcanine, Gyarados, etc. all sound MUCH stronger than a simple Raticate, right?

And while this isn't a specific example from the games THEMSELVES, in Pokémon Origins, it basically flat-out confirms Blue wasn't lying when he said he's been working on the PokéDex. You find out he's caught every Pokémon in the Dex except for Mewtwo, and failed.

When Prof. Oak says that Blue ""forgot to trust and believe in his Pokémon"", he means he got too caught up in winning and trying to be the very best (like no one ever was) rather than enjoying his journey and bonding with his team, like Red presumably does.

Blue doesn't get wrapped up in revenge against his rival. He doesn't feel any seething jealousy toward him because his grandfather gives him all the attention.

He's just a cocky asshole that mellows out overtime after Red beats him enough to the point he learns some humility. And not much else.

Him being part of TR is a good headcanon or AU, but it the theory would need a bit more support for it to be believably canon in any way.",2016-01-28 02:57:05+00:00,czeot6k,,t1_cyw6466,,pokemonconspiracies

Koffing doesn't say ""Whoa-ho-ho!"" (In Explorers, every character who had a specific catch phrase or laugh would repeat it literally every other sentence, so it was a bit odd to me not hearing it at all in PSMD, but with what little dialogue Koffing had in PSMD, I can give this one a pass, too.)

Gengar doesn't have ""Kekekeh!"" as his regular laugh. He says ""Hee-hee!"" instead.

One of Post Town's inhabitants is a Dwebble, and in the post-game, he pretends to have evolved into a Crustle, making fun of a trope in the previous PMD games where it was obligatory to have one town Pokémon evolve to show off the evolving mechanic (i.e. Granbull in Rescue Team and Ursaring in Explorers).

Anyway, I digress. Dwebble later stops the ruse and the Crustle he asked to pose as him stays in Post Town. The Crustle says dialogue similar to what's said in this thread's PSMD screenshot, saying you shouldn't mistake him for tiramisu in Gates while here he just says he's not meant to be eaten.

Either this is just some strange running joke with the Pokémon Crustle in general or the English translators for PSMD might not have realized this was another cameo from a past game?
