I literally just discovered the sub just today, and it's amazing! I've been planning on making translyrics (translated lyrics that are both close-enough to a decent translation of the original *and* are singable in English) to a few of them, but some of them don't have any translations to be found...not even poorly translated ones.

Here's a good example of a cover that does an amazing job at writing coherent and equivalent English translyrics without sounding awkward or poorly paced: https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=s_cWgJ5u6xU

The Nichijou Wiki also has a decent translation of Yukko no Gag Hyaku Renpatsu, Yukko wa Honto ni Baka Danaa, and Nakamura-sensei no Kagaku no Na no Moto ni, among a few others, but almost all of them are incomplete. Some songs don't even have any translations at all.

And while I'm definitely grateful for the work the people put into translating the songs already available, I'm also looking for a complete translation of Nano no Nejimawashi Rhapsody, Nano no Ohirune Sentaku, Mai No Namida No Amida Nyorai, and Sakamoto-san no nyaa to Iu to demo Omotta ka!

If anyone were to have any given translation of any of those songs (as long as they cover the entire song), it would be greatly appreciated! If not, I'm more than content working with what I already have...and maybe even Google Translating the songs I don't have already have a base on and getting creative with them!

Do you think Mystery Dungeons also drastically change, alter themselves, appear, and disappear *entirely* throughout the world?

Obviously there are 'meta' reasons for why PSMD didn't just reuse *every* town and older dungeon from the the older games, like gameplay mechanic issues, remastering or reusing almost  *every* old music track for the dungeons, adding in remastered versions of some of the old dungeons backgrounds, fitting and reusing certain places like Paradise and the Pelipper Post Office, and the impossibility of re-rendering them into faithful re-imaginings because of Deposit Boxes, Pelipper Island, the Kangaskhan Cafe, the use of certain duplicate NPCs, and references to the heroes and partners from past games...

... But this is me trying to speculate a 'plot' reason as to why the PMD world changed so drastically over the years.

Mystery Dungeons are said to crop up much more often whenever the world is facing some kind of calamity (like intense natural disasters, time stopping, space distorting, unnatural nightmares brewing, etc.). But Super pays no mention of this fact in the game; it simply explains to us what a Mystery Dungeon is, and doesn't relate the conflict of the story (petrification) to the dungeons themselves, like Rescue Team and Explorers do. 

Gates didn't relate its conflict with Mystery Dungeons cropping up, either, but unlike Super, Gates sort of did its own thing with them and established a more solid system with how the dungeons work, and gave us a ton of new information about them, which I'll address in a bit.

So I'd like to assume...that even during peacetime, Mystery Dungeons happen to somehow change on their own regardless of whether the world is in danger or not (though new dungeons themselves may not show up as *often* as they would during a calamity). 

Gates to Infinity introduced ""Mysteriosity"", a phenomenon that alters dungeons you've already been to at varying levels, some taking you to different chambers, some taking you to a completely different area, and some taking you to an alternate version of the dungeon you're in before taking you back to the original dungeon after a few floors. And Mysteriosity only becomes more common *after* you beat the main story, so this only supports my hypothesis on Mystery Dungeons changing even during peacetime.

So Zero Isle turning from five long, excruciatingly difficult dungeons into one short dungeon; Mystery Jungle shrinking from 30 floors to 13; Steam Cave and Fogbound Lake tipping over to form Heart Lake; Mt. Freeze melting somewhat to become Distress Mountain... They're all a result of natural occurrences in the world.

And if the world is constantly changing this drastically in such short periods of time, then the Expedition Society's and the partner's goal of charting a complete map of the world is completely unrealistic, because the planet will always continue to change and form new landmarks and places to explore.

Cartographers would have to constantly rewrite their maps and document as many versions of the world as possible. So maybe the Pokemon Nexus getting destroyed on a near-daily basis before you and your partner arrived really *isn't* that big of a deal after all.

I know there's this whole debate about whether Super is the last PMD game, but *if* another PMD game comes, maybe they might justify adding in a new world/continent by having it take place away from all the older characters, at a time so far ahead from Super that the world looks *completely* different, even continent-wise?

Or maybe they might just have the next game (if there is one) take place in an alternate universe with a completely separate world from Super's without giving much explanation for it.

Either way, the way Mystery Dungeons are described and the way they work have never been consistent. 

What do you guys think? Is this a good-enough justification as to why Super changed the PMD world to the point the older areas are only recognizable by the shape of their respective continent?

I dunno. What do you guys think? Obviously the map just wasn't intended to be relevant and was just there to accentuate Mawile's character/career choice as an archaeologist, but the fact that it was there and glaring at me with that suspicious description bugged me.

I just noticed that, in PSMD's trailer, some Pokémon refer to ""turning into stone"" as ""petrification"" instead (see Kyogre at 1:05). ""Petrification...?""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5uIYtWNivo

That's changed in the final game, where at 26:56, Kyogre says ""Turning to stone...?"" instead.

Literally everyone in the game refers to the problem in the world as ""turning to stone."" ""Turning-to-stone incidents"", ""turning rock-solid stone"", ""turned to stone""... It gets a little redundant.

There are a couple times throughout the story where your partner asks for elaboration on what ""turning to stone"" means, and rationalizes them both as ""turning into rocks"" and ""becoming stone"", respectively. Said cutscenes take place in Serene Village when Lombre talks about this happening for the first time, and in Baram Town when Amoongus and company talk about it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymqrw7rMUuU at 1:13

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2fMjtPbldg at 13:15

I assume that, in the original cut of the game, the characters in both cutscenes were referring to these incidents as ""petrification"" instead, which would give a more reasonable explanation as to why the partner would want to know what they mean by that. The final cut of the game just makes the partner act a little *too* shocked at what's going on.

I guess the localization team changed it last-minute to avoid confusion with the Petrify Orb and Petrify Wand, since those two items stun enemy Pokémon rather than turn them to stone. Maybe they thought younger players would have a hard time differentiating the two versions of the word, so they stuck with one blanket term instead?

* While this may just be a coincidence, the climax of both the Rescue Team games and OR/AS involved Rayquaza taking out a meteor from the sky--a meteor that was the underlying secret cause for ALL of the plot's conflict, a meteor that was hurtling toward the planet threatening to destroy it, and one that just happened to contain the legendary Pokemon Deoxys. 

To add onto this, PSMD seems to call back to either Rescue Team or OR/AS's climax as well, by having its starting scene take place in space, with what appears to be a ""meteor"" hurtling to Earth and Rayquaza and Deoxys indirectly interacting, and having them work together at PSMD's climax, when they help hold back the Tree of Life from hurtling toward the sun.

* Gates to Infinity introduced a team-wide Exp Share, allowing *all* Pokemon that are recruited in one's team--even ones that don't tag along with you in dungeons or on missions--receive Exp Points and level up alongside you, eliminating almost any need you'll have to grind. Gates to Infinity is considered a 5th gen game; Pokemon X/Y were released several months later to start 6th gen, and they were the first main series games to implement a team-wide Exp Share of their own.

* Super Mystery Dungeon has a new, more user-friendly and convenient move system that immediately tells you what moves are effective and non-effective against any and all Pokemon you're fighting through different symbols, and teaches you type-effectiveness without having to go through the usual trial and error/guesswork many newcomers deal with when first starting out. PSMD is a 6th gen game; come Sun and Moon, the first 7th gen games, and we find out that they *also* do the same thing, telling you what moves are effective against whatever Pokemon you're fighting through symbols that indicate so.

Do you think, in the case of Gates and X/Y, as well as Super and S/M, that Spike Chunsoft were explicitly told by Game Freak to add said major gameplay elements in their PMD games to foreshadow or to ease in Pokemon players into the next main series gen? Or did Game Freak take a look at the additions the past two PMD games added and decided to apply them to the main series games as well? Or is this all just one huge coincidence and both companies just happened to add the team-wide Exp Share and instant type effectiveness symbols at around the same time?

If you could form your own guild or society (akin to Wigglytuff's Guild in Explorers and Ampharos's Expedition Society in Super):

* What Pokémon would you use, how many would you include total, and why? (For reference, Wigglytuff's Guild consists of 10 members, and the Expedition Society consists of 8. If you count the hero and partner, the guild has 12 and the society has 10.) You're free to use any of the 721+ Pokémon available! (Including the ones just released!)

* What specific jobs would each chosen Pokemon have (either existing positions already introduced in the games or new ones entirely), and what would be your reasoning for each decision? For example, who would be the leader, the second-in-command, the cook, etc.... Will it also have an elder/more experienced Pokemon that isn't officially affiliated with them that your group might turn to for help (i.e. Whiscash and Torkoal)?

* What rules would it have, if any? (i.e. the catchy morning cheers we've come to know and love from Wigglytuff's Guild, or the lesser known laws of the Expedition Society posted in the rooms on the left of the lobby that are just quirky life lessons). Also feel free to add any other silly/serious quirks as well, like both teams' vendetta against solicitors and sales-mon! 

* What kind of place would it be located in? It *can* be somewhere in the canon world PSMD has established, but it can also be somewhere entirely new and non-canon! What landscape, what town, and why? Does it reflect the place's/team's theme, if it has one?

* What would your group be called? Will it be a guild, a society, a training center, a semi-large group of freedom fighters? At this point it just looks like the series is trying to use as many different synonyms for ""rescue"" and ""explore"" as they possibly can to use exclusively for each game, but you don't have to follow that if you have other ideas in mind!

* Lastly, what will your group's goals be? What is their purpose? Wigglytuff's Guild just wanted to take jobs and explore the continent, while the Expedition Society planned on making a complete map of the world!

While this is justifiable with most legendary Pokémon--as there are only one of certain legendaries in existence--doesn't it make it confusing for everyone else when they come across more than one Pokémon of the same species at the same time?

The games' writing is never consistent when it comes to making us want to think there's only one of each civilized species of Pokémon in the world, or whether they want us to think there are multiple of the same civilized species in the world.

For example, in the Explorers games' post-game, when Chatot suggests that one possible way to cure Azurill's nightmare is through the aid of ""a Pokémon called Drowzee"", your partner goes, ""Oh! Drowzee?! We know Drowzee! But he was an Outlaw, wasn't he?! And we fought him a while ago!"" as if he was the only Drowzee in existence.

Chatot *could've* mentioned there being multiple Drowzee, and your partner *could've* said, ""We know *a* Drowzee"", instead of ""We know the exact Pokémon we need""...but didn't. After all, what if our team had already recruited a different Drowzee from some other dungeon? 

But I guess the game decided to write it in a simple-enough way that would both extend the story and give that specific Outlaw Drowzee some more character development.

This is only one example, though. There are a few other moments where they treat an entire species of Pokémon as one specific Pokémon like they did with Drowzee. It's apparently done so often that the Explorers games decided to make fun of this trope through Team Poochy (a team comprised of three Poochyena), and all the Shaymin in Shaymin Village, who jokingly acknowledge how counter-productive and odd it is that everyone is named the same thing. Since everyone is a Shaymin.

Sure, in the earlier PMD games, the player could nickname all their recruits, but later on, only you and your partner can get nicknames. 

It's a weird and inconsistent naming system, and has led to a lot of arguments as to whether one NPC is the same as another; like Wigglytuff, Spinda, Gardevoir, Medicham, Diglett, and Dugtrio between Rescue Team to Explorers; Lombre, Nuzleaf, Snubbull, Teddiursa, Ursaring, and Murkrow from Rescue Team and Explorers to Super; etc.

Do you think Spike Chunsoft should keep every Pokémon named after their species? Or should they go the fan-PMD route and give plot-relevant Pokémon actual names and maybe even distinguishing features to keep us from confusing one species of Pokémon for another Pokémon of the same species?

It's such a small and insignificant detail, but I loved it as a kid and I still like it now. Especially when looking back and talking to individual story characters in the Explorers games. 

And if you did like doing the same thing, what are some of your favorite dungeon quotes, and from which Pokémon from which game?

-- 

* Rescue Team: 

Rescue Team just had each individual species say strictly three individual quotes each, depending on whether they had high, mid, or low health, usually revolving around something about their species, pretty much quoting something out of the PokeDex about themselves. And your partner would just get all custom quotes, but didn't really add too much of value. It was still a nice touch regardless, though, and helped me learn a lot more about each and every Pokémon as a kid.

* Explorers: 

What I loved about Explorers was, even though all the *generic* Pokémon no longer had individual quotes for every species (and instead had stock quotes for specific *groups* of Pokémon rather than individual species), all the *story characters* got SEVERAL unique in-dungeon quotes each--several depending on what three stages of health they had as well--and it definitely helped add to the illusion that you were actually traveling with them as you were going through a dungeon to me. 

You wouldn't believe how many times [spoilers](#s ""I talked to Dusknoir and Celebi in every dungeon I was with them in every time I played through Special Episode 5. I used to think Dusknoir's development was rushed near the end, but taking the time to read every single interaction they had helped me think they really had begun to bond somewhat overtime."")

[spoilers](#s ""Dusknoir literally has a ton of different dialogue in every dungeon you take him in! Such a small detail they put a lot of effort into writing in."") 

* Gates to Infinity:

Much like hunger, IQ, loss of items and money when you faint, the ability to recruit Kecleon, and the restraint to not use Orbs in boss battles, the ability to talk to your teammates in dungeons was also taken away in this game. A shame, too, because with how character-driven this game's story is, it would've been the perfect opportunity to give this game's story characters some lines as you're traveling together to break the usual monotony of just attacking and exploring floor after floor. 

If it followed the same treatment Explorers got with its dungeon dialogue, then I would've loved to hear some banter from [spoilers](#s ""Hydreigon as you're traveling with him through each story dungeon when you're stuck with him, for example."") 

... But instead, your recruits and teammates just pose whenever you talk to them. It's a cute gesture, but not as good imo.

* Super:

I'm grateful that they brought dungeon quotes back! Though they seemed to combine elements from every game when implementing them. 

It takes the Rescue Team route with its generic recruits by having everyone say something generic about their species, straight out of the PokeDex.

It takes a few cues from Explorers by giving significant characters and character cameos unique dialogue.

*And* it makes it a bit of a pain to even get to *read* their dialogue in the first place, because it's determined by random chance whether they want to speak to you or not, and most of the time they don't, and take the Gates route by posing. 

*But* each and every Pokémon now only has *two* quotes each instead of at least three or more--one at high health and one at low health. Not a big deal, and definitely not a bad thing considering there are 720 Pokémon to keep yourself entertained on their own, with or without some extra dialogue. So I can see why the extra effort from the writers and developers didn't exactly feel worth it to implement, especially when not many characters in this game really had anything interesting to say.

Super also introduced Helper Pokémon quotes, so now everyone you come into contact with either through StreetPass or the Internet can say something uplifting or silly whenever you run into them in a dungeon!

During the face-off against Dark Matter, when Arceus mentions all available Pokemon that can fly were fighting near the Tree of Life, the screen pans specifically to a Skarmory, Zapdos, Moltres, and Articuno, all flying next to each other.

**In Rescue Team:**

* Certain types of Pokémon can band together to create items like Teleport Gems to reach areas impossible to get to by foot. 

* HMs also seemed to have a mystical power that set them apart from TMs that made them required to bring while traveling in order to reach certain dungeons.

**In Explorers:**

* Lapras was able to transport chosen Pokémon through the sea of time to access hidden areas. 

* Palkia could tear open fabrics of space to fly and reach nearly any place within his dominion near-instantly, with or without others on his back. 

* Pokémon like Dusknoir and Darkrai could somehow open up Dimensional Holes at will to go wherever they want (or to some place entirely at random) whenever they want. 

* Ancient vehicles like the Rainbow Stoneship were confirmed to have existed to help levitate Pokémon from place to place with the right artifact. 

* And in Sky-only, Drifblim acts as a gondola to help carry Pokémon across extremely high mountains.

**In Gates:** 

* Entercards and Magnagates were introduced, which inherently gave the ability of teleportation to the Pokémon using them, but introduced a more complex system of doing so. Cards had to be arranged in a certain way, Pokémon had to master the use of them, a dungeon or two had to be traversed before you're teleported to your chosen destination, etc.

**And in Super:** 

* The Lapras Travel Line was introduced, where Lapras now acts more like a traditional ship, sailing Pokémon from continent to continent across the world's oceans. 

* Pokémon like Celebi could just teleport multiple Pokémon at will without the need for a Teleport Gem.

As a kid, before Platinum came out and before we got to see Cyrus more fleshed out as a person, I always had this headcanon that the reason why he was so emotionless and why he wanted to destroy the world and create a new one in his image was because, after all he had gone through in his tortured past, he had a small encounter with Mesprit when he was younger that ended in him losing all of his emotions. Overtime that loss of emotions caused him to feel like he needed to mark his place in the world as someone unique and superior to everyone else, which is why he formed Team Galactic to try to wipe everyone he deemed ""incomplete"" off the face of the earth. 

One of Cyrus's quotes in D/P atop the Spear Pillar struck me. ""But why? Why would Mesprit, the Being of Emotion, appear by your side?""

Seeing Cyrus single Mesprit out by walking all the way to Lake Verity by himself at the beginning of Platinum also seemed to support his personal beef with it, in my opinion. It made me think that somewhere, deep down, he resented Mesprit for wiping his emotions, and made me see his plan not just as an attempt of self-fulfillment, but as an attempt at revenge for stripping him of his humanity when he was at his most vulnerable, pushing him to this point.

But then, at later points in Platinum (not in D/P), you get to see that Cyrus isn't as emotionless as he claims himself to be. You see his egotistical nature when he tries to deface Celestic Town's ancient carvings. You see him snicker at how he deems his underlings to be incompetent, mindless fools. You see him burst out in anger at Cynthia when she attempts to rationalize why Cyrus feels the way he does. And that's when he admits that his heart, too, is as incomplete as the everyone else's, cursing himself for not being able to bottle up and truly suppress his emotions to the extent he wanted.

So that's when my headcanon changed a bit.

While the previous headcanon can still be applicable to Cyrus and his actions in Diamond and Pearl, his character was expanded upon so much in Platinum that he can be interpreted as a somewhat different person.

What if, after all of the trauma he had to endure as a child, he eventually grew into myths and actually *wanted* Mesprit to wipe away his emotions, but was never successful at making it do so? Hence why he seemed to grow more resentful at it over the other two when you see him looking over Lake Verity. He surely must despise and even partially blame the Being of Emotion for instilling people he deems lower than him the right to feel happiness and joy when he, as someone who had gone through so much, cannot. 

And that's why he formed Team Galactic. To give him the feeling of self-fulfillment he always wanted that he never got trying to live up to his parents' expectations...to try to shed his humanity and become someone greater than the people who wronged him...and to spite Mesprit for not making him the ""complete"" being he wanted to be.

Because no matter how hard he tried, he could never truly get rid of his human emotions. He managed to evolve his Golbat into a Crobat, meaning he isn't as far gone as most people imagine. His Pokémon seem to like him, at least, and that's a straight fact.

It's also why I like to think the Pokémon on his team were Pokémon that have also suffered at the hands of other people, causing him to take them in as partners for helping him make a new world they, too, can live in. It could also serve as fuel for why he blames human emotion to be the source of all strife. With his asocial attitude, he must have grown up oversimplifying real issues and putting himself above them, avoiding tackling them entirely rather than adjusting to them accordingly and changing the world for the better like a normal person.

However, there are also two NPCs in Sunyshore City that mentions that very city is Cyrus's hometown, and that Team Galactic strangely hasn't been anywhere near it.

Even after all he had gone through, Cyrus might have still had a small attachment to the city he was born and raised in, and left it alone, under the excuse that Sunyshore had nothing to aid him with in his plans. Though he made sure none of his members visited it, either--not even to simply steal other people's Pokémon or terrorize the place like they planned to do with Floaroma, Pastoria, and Celestic Town, the three of which also had nothing to do with their greater plans.

I get the feeling that, with what he was trying to do, he might not have even wanted to face his hometown once he set the path he wanted his life to go down, simply sparing it before his act at the Spear Pillar as a small act of saving grace.

This is why I liked Cyrus. He wasn't as blatant as Lysandre and there seemed to be more to him than what we were explicitly given to imply in the game alone. Not only that, but Lysandre's plans and ideals were very clearly flawed (or were somewhat poorly conveyed) compared to Cyrus's in Platinum.

What do you think? I'd love feedback on either of these two headcanons, and whether they hold up, or if they have any holes in them.

But that isn't to say that there isn't romantic subtext in these games at all, outside of pure headcanon.

Krookodile clearly grew to have a crush on Miltank over the course of the game, and nearly everyone in Post Town seemed to get infatuated with Virizion at first (despite what the extremely sugarcoated game text suggested otherwise). Heck, even Umbreon and Espeon were confused to be a couple in the Jellicent Show for comedic value.

And let's not forget all the fanart shipping the hero and partner from each game.

So what are your favorite ships, canon or otherwise, and why? Feel free to talk purely canonically or delve into your most convoluted of headcanons! And if you ship a hero and partner from any game, what species do you prefer them to be shipped as?

Nowadays I just have Jirachi sent, with the message, ""I'm a genius!""

The game tends to filter out story-related Pokémon and story-related messages for those who have a spoiler block on, though, so I'm not sure if either of those two were able to help as many people as I expected.

The Helper Pokémon feature is actually really neat! It pleasantly surprises me whenever a Helper Pokémon I received pops in out of nowhere to try to help me through a floor.

If they're supposed to have gone extinct millions of years ago, why are there so many in PMD? Sure, I guess this could be another thing that ties back to the PMD world being a post-apocalyptic human-less version of the human world, where scientists from all across the world revived enough fossil Pokémon for them to become as populated as any other species, but...

I've just noticed the PMD world isn't always consistent as to what they want us to imagine the human world to be. Sure, every game advertises itself to have specifically ""you"" be the protagonist, and not some other stoic mute shell (i.e. Link, Red, etc.), but...

Rescue Team has Gengar, who was Gardevoir's partner in the human world. This may he imply he was a Pokémon Trainer living in the human world from the *main series games*. The existence of manmade Pokémon and the descriptions of certain Friend Areas also support the idea that the PMD world may very well be an alternate reality of the main series games as well.

Meanwhile, Explorers mentions that there may be at least one more human living in the PMD world in their natural form, *coexisting* with the Pokémon there, and that very human was the Explorers protagonist, who was also implied to be a Trainer (or, if not a Trainer, a human with a close bond with his Pokémon) who had Grovyle as his partner (until he turned into a Pokémon himself, of course).

But then you cut to Gates to Infinity, which pretty much up and tells you that the human world that game refers to is the *real world*, thanks to the gameplay element of Magnagates using the 3DS camera on real, circular objects and the 4th-wall breaking scene involving you in the Worldcore.

Super also seems to imply the human world is the *real world* as well, but to a lesser extent. In the very beginning of the game, when you boot it up for the first time, the title screen takes advantage of the 3DS camera to show you and your surroundings under the backdrop of the portal leading you into the Pokémon world. Mew's dialogue at the very beginning also appears while the 3DS camera is still active, meaning the spot where you, the player, was sitting in at that moment is where she found you.

So which world qualifies as the ""true"" human world according to PMD canon? The real world or the main series world? Or is it both? Does this fall under the idea of multiple timelines and universes like the main series games do?

And as for my point about fossil Pokémon, a lot of them are treated as extremely, extremely old in the PMD games (at least in Explorers), so that's why I was wondering if it really was a case of too many Cinnabar/Oreburgh-esque resurrections back in the day allowing huge bursts of population growth...

...or the possibility that fossil Pokémon never became extinct in the first place in the PMD world in its history. 

With manmade Pokémon, it's easier to argue that it was simply because the PMD world was formerly inhabited by humans that they exist, but with fossils, it's harder for me to pin. After all, you find a plethora of Anorith in Drenched Bluff and Tyrunt in the School Forest.

And, well, Archen being part of the Expedition Society. Do fossil Pokémon just have extremely long life spans, then? Carracosta seems like he's outlived many, many Pokémon in his day. As do some of the fossil-related side missions in Explorers, who tell you outright they've lived for generations.

At 26:41, who was the one giving that foreboding dialogue?

When I first beat the game some months ago, I initially assumed it was just the Litwick being silly, making this point in the game around the time they form their newfound partnership with Solosis. With him on their side, I figured the Litwick were rejoicing now that they were able to begin properly scaring other Pokemon after the dry spell they've had, starving for any kind of negative feelings to feed on.

Though now that I think about it, the text at 26:41 uses the word ""discontent"", while the Litwick mainly seem to feed off of fear over all else.

Maybe the Litwick happened to be feeding off of Chikorita's discontent, or were feeding off another Pokemon's discontent elsewhere at the same time this was happening?

The Banette NPC in the Grass Continent states that she feeds off of a lot of negative emotions in general, and needs those to survive--and not just fear, so maybe the Litwick could be in the same boat as her, but they prefer to absorb fear the most?

TheGoldCrow went with that voice being Dark Matter, which makes the most sense and is the safest option to go with, considering its motives in the game, but for one reason or another, it doesn't sPEaK LiKE tHiS. 

So maybe Dark Matter was preying on Chikorita's discontent/another Pokemon's negative feelings at the time? Maybe it was feeding off of Rayquaza's fear, considering the last foreshadowing cutscene had shown him flying away from the planet?

Was making Dark Matter's speech jumbled up a late move on the developers' part? Is this meant to be Dark Matter, but it ended up being an error on the English translators' part and they accidentally wrote its text normally? What is this part like in other languages?

Then the four of them hatch a plan to make Nuzleaf look like the good guy and the Beheeyem look like the bad guys to lull you into a false sense of security under his guardianship so he could gradually gain your trust and nudge you into doing what he wants.

... That much I understand, which explains why the Beheeyem never show up at all during the first half of the story, but when you and your partner are about to leave Serene Village, why are they lurking right outside it? And what were the Beheeyem even *doing* during all that time before then? 

If Nuzleaf surely wanted to try to keep you in the village so you could eventually reach the top of Revelation Mountain (no matter how many tries it would take), why would he have the Beheeyem publicly wandering around the place at that point, giving you another reason to leave the village so you won't get attacked again?

Sure, Nuzleaf changes his mind shortly after and lets you leave, but that's not the mindset he had when the Beheeyem were reported to being seen by Roselia.

Was it all another elaborate ruse to reverse-psychology you into staying? Having Nuzleaf say you should leave, so you could be more concerned for the village and stay?

Or were the Beheeyem *literally* taking *that* long to catch up to you and Nuzleaf to get to Serene Village? Did they get lost in the Lush Forest or something?

I figure they must have been teleported out of there by Dark Matter at some point to help turn other Pokémon into stone with Nuzleaf whenever he went out on one of his ""adventures""...but who knows.

What do you guys think? And aside from that, what do you think the Beheeyem's story is? 

* Nuzleaf was always a denizen of Serene Village (though I also headcanon him to be a former member of Team Shiftry) and happened to be at the right place at the right time when you arrived in the PMD world, so he had the perfect place to take advantage of you, and the perfect alibi and lifestyle to make him look totally innocent.

* Yveltal (being the embodiment of death and destruction) was a nice pawn to have because it already had the power to turn Pokémon to stone (practically ""killing"" them) without Dark Matter's help, and is just overall an extremely strong legendary Pokémon. He's also the perfect scapegoat to blame for all of this should Dark Matter want to keep its existence a secret to the Pokémon of this world if ever it wasn't strong enough to want to make itself known yet.

But the Beheeyem never lived in the village in the first place and weren't accepted until the post-game where they were allowed to settle down there. Not to mention that the Beheeyem don't exactly have any upstanding qualities that make them good henchmen to choose out of all 720 Pokémon to brainwash.

I mean, feel free to tell me I'm overthinking the plot of this game if you want, and that the Beheeyem and their actions are (realistically) just plot devices to move the story forward, and that their species shouldn't matter, which is true, but I just like nitpicking or going unnecessarily deep into details like these.",MysteryDungeon,The Beheeyem,https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteryDungeon/comments/4df1u5/the_beheeyem/

[spoilers](#s ""In the stockade, when your partner starts worrying whether or not the Sableye will use Fury Swipes or not like Grovyle predicted..."") 

In Time/Darkness, [spoilers](#s ""Grovyle says, ""If that happens...we're done for."""")

In Sky, [spoilers](#s "" Grovyle says, ""If that happens... Try not to think about it!"""")

Something similar happens at Crystal Lake, where the dialogue is watered down ever so slightly. Probably happens in other sections of the game as well.

A few other minor dialogue changes are present in Sky, but usually it's just done for added comedic effect like in the beginning of the game on the beach and don't really take away from the scene at all. Especially since nothing was changed there; the extra dialogue at the beach was *added* rather than *replaced*.

Otherwise, though, why do you think they would go through the effort of rewriting just those few sentences all throughout the story? Time/Darkness already avoided using variants of the word ""die"" as it is, so why would Sky go even further with it, especially when Special Episode 5 goes even darker than ever (both figuratively and literally)? 

And *especially* when the translation is still as awkward and repetitive as ever in Sky? You'd think of all things, they'd have fixed that, but nope. 

It's not really a big deal at all at the end of the day; it just got me wondering. It's not something most people really notice while playing each game anyhow.

They went through a dungeon, found the room that had its treasure, pretended to be stone statues, and waited some unstated amount of time for the next, plucky explorer to arrive...

...only so they could show off and leave, assert themselves, and run off with the treasure to leave said plucky explorer for dead knowing full well the temple they were in would collapse once they opened the chest inside.

rip in pieces Graveler 2009-2009

They could've just taken the treasure and left. If the game wanted them to look cool and have a flashy entrance, they could've done it in a less mean-spirited way. Especially since they're made out to be the ""good guys"" here.

And then they say they ""can't stand other explorers being bullied."" Hypocritical much? They messed with that Graveler for practically no reason. He even says ""he's been working hard as an Explorer"" and needed some kind of big break like this as a little confidence boost. It's not like he was in their way or anything; Team Charm was already there first. 

It also doesn't make sense that they'd help Wigglytuff out right after, considering what we were shown prior. Oh well. 

Medicham from Team Meanies is a part of the team...so I guess their occasional carelessness and hijinks can be partially because of her. And since Gardevoir lost her memory during Rescue Team's post-game, she's a blank slate and could've easily fallen under the influence of her and Lopunny. And maybe Lopunny's just really flamboyant and into showing off? I don't know. [](#bulbasaur5)

At the end of the day it's just a small nitpick, but I just picked up on it now.

Also, sidenote: Since PMD likes to treat *almost* every species of Pokémon as its singular character, does that mean the Dunsparce that shows up in this Special Episode could be the very same one from Gates? They even have the exact same personality and everything. Even some of the exact same phrases of dialogue. It'd be cool if Gates's Dunsparce was partially inspired by the one here.

And I love how it explains why Team AWD likes to constantly proclaim themselves as a band of thieves whenever they show up. They may like to pillage and steal, but apparently they deem *lying* of all things as irredeemable of an Exploration Team. So *that's* why they're so brutally honest about them being scoundrels.

Over the years, I've seen quite a few comments on YouTube making ballads and lyrics to describe the theme for Treasure Town. Though it wasn't until I read Bespinben's description of his piano arrangement of Serene Village that I began to see this track in a new light. And then I listened to said arrangement several, several times, and it got me thinking.

Thinking about how I always adored the relationship between Carracosta and your partner. I wished Carracosta was expanded upon just ever so slightly to make him slightly more of a foil (or parallel) to Nuzleaf, especially since Nuzleaf had more of a part in the overall story as both a parent and a main character overall. (Though I did really like Carracosta's and Nuzleaf's implied friendship at the end of the game).

The parent-child relationships in Super were really sweet, and what we saw in the Connection Orb only gives us a ton to work with in our imaginations of what the other Serene schoolchildren's families are like. Even Espurr's.

The lyrics might not be the most perfect; I spent about an hour thinking up and typing these down just now when the inspiration hit me, and this is my first time really delving into something like this lyrically. So any feedback or criticism is appreciated! I based the stresses of each syllable of Bespinben's piano arrangement rather than the original; I feel the instrumentation there just fits the mood better to me. And the lyrics are about the same length as his arrangement.

Did something happen to previous children Ampharos willingly took under his wing? To the point he was discouraged to hire more, until he saw the hero's and partner's actions and adventures and how they were able to handle themselves on their own in Serene Village?

Or maybe Ampharos is just overly-sensitive (like how Keldeo was in Gates) and he was still japed by Dedenne's sick burn from earlier ~~or I'm just overthinking every little detail of this game~~

My personal headcanon was that the Ampharos in Super was the same one who temporarily lived near the top of Sky Peak in Explorers of Sky, and that the Mawile from Team Frontier would later join him once Spinda was done with his café business. 

Maybe since he and Mawile ran into both the hero and partner from Explorers back then and saw how strong they were, he was encouraged to let any and all children join the Expedition Society, but things went wrong, and he's been iffy on the whole situation ever since?

At the end of the day, both groups are great and I like them both about equally, and in-game, if these two were to ever meet, I'm sure they'd probably become fast friends rather than bitter rivals. Let's do the same and have a civil discussion. I'm only comparing them for the fun of it, out of curiosity.

So I just finished 100%ing Super recently, and a couple questions came to mind. Most people tend to get the habit of comparing Explorers to every other PMD game--*especially* Super--and this topic has been on my mind for a while, so I wanted to ask:

If they were to fight, who do you think would win in a friendly battle? The entire Expedition Society, or all of Wigglytuff's Guild? Minus the hero and partner, of course. And assuming all of them are at even levels.

--

Also, who do you think is overall better-written? Mentioning your personal preferences and/or biases here is fine as long as you call them out for being just that, but I do want to know what everyone thinks when comparing them side by side.

I grew up with Explorers, and I personally find the Expedition Society to be better-written. They served as better role models for the hero and partner despite their quirky attitudes, and their strength in battle compared to yours helped reflect that. Unlike the Guild, the Society was *actually* useful--each member had something to offer, they each had a ""proper"" job, and each of them had their own spotlight in the story.

* Archen was your temporary guardian and escorts you through the Mystical Forest and Revelation Mountain II. He's also the closest thing the team has to a Pokémon that can handle aerial expeditions. 

* Buizel escorts you through Fire Island Volcano and has a short burst of character development when he realizes he should stop being too prideful of his own strength and should stop acting as condescending on the hero and partner just because they're children...right after Entei beats the crap out of him. Reminiscent of how quickly Shiftry (from Rescue Team) learned his lesson after getting beat up by Zapdos (though this was handled slightly better with Buizel imo). He also handles water-based expeditions.

* Bunnelby, while I admit he isn't the most memorable character, was still around to escort you through Showdown Mountain and proves his mettle as the Society's ground-terrain specialist.

* And Mawile is known for being the second strongest of the team and helps unravel the mysteries of any relics the team finds as the Society's resident archeologist.

* Jirachi is the astronomer, Dedenne handles communications to keep everyone together, and Swirlix cooks (though I actually dislike her as a character).

* And Ampharos just seems to be a better leader to me. He still has that silly exterior that Wigglytuff also has, but it's less overbearing and you actually get to *see* more of him being useful and why everyone reveres him as their leader. With Wigglytuff, you don't get as much of that.

Basically, everyone in the Society is just more organized and professional than the Guild, each with jobs that actually *matter*, with characters that actually contribute to the plot rather than just *being there* for next to no reason. And most of the Society is still able to have likable personalities!

Meanwhile, Wigglytuff's Guild just looks disorganized and shoddy in comparison. 

* Keeping the Guild empty during expeditions...

* Not seeing that Team Skull are clearly bad Pokémon...

* Having everyone ignore the Drought Stone literally lying there, 10 feet away from base camp, so ONLY the hero and partner are the ones to conveniently see it...

* Not realizing that Dusknoir literally *dragged* the hero and partner into the future *while declaring it OUT LOUD* when *literally everyone* saw it with their own eyes...and thinking you two just slipped in the portal by accident.

Not to mention, the majority of the Guild was useless and added nothing to the story. Everyone but Bidoof, Wigglytuff, and Chatot could've been taken out of the picture and almost nothing would change.

* Bidoof has a nice character dynamic with the hero and partner, with him being rookies with the two of you. 

* And Chatot and Wigglytuff served their purposes to the plot later in the story with Lapras, while Wigglytuff himself was made a lot more likable in his Special Episode. We also got to see Wigglytuff actually BE a good explorer in his Special Episodes instead of *just* a silly goofball that messes around. Chatot gets some decent character development as well by Brine Cave (though I know plenty of people, even Explorers fans, still dislike Chatot regardless).

But everyone else? While the Society has Bunnelby and Swirlix who aren't memorable or useful (I hate Swirlix with a passion)...in the Guild, everyone *but* Wigglytuff, Chatot, and Bidoof have any substance. They were practically walking, talking catch-phrases and almost nothing else.

But despite their incompetence, the entirety of the Guild was still likable and memorable. They just didn't help very much.

**TL;DR:** Who would win in a fight, Wigglytuff's Guild or Ampharos's Expedition Society? And which do you think is better-written?

Your partner is able to read the ancient text scattered throughout the Voidlands that explains everything about Dark Matter, but everything about Void Shadows is cut off. ""Look out for Void Shadows! Void Shadows will make Pok--"" is all that's said about them. 

Sure, everyone who was *recently* turned to stone ends up alright in the end once Dark Matter is defeated, but still; the majority of the Expedition Society get swallowed, and the Hero and Partner (and Mawile) nearly share the same fate, but you're saved before you get to see exactly what happens to you.

My headcanon is that once you're swallowed, the Void Shadows will be able to take over your body, able to transform at will between your form and its blobby form to either disguise itself to pretend to ally with fresh Pokémon (like what happened with Bunnelby) or to fight and take advantage of its new abilities against those fighting against them (like the ""illusory"" Mega Tyranitar and Mega Gengar).

That actually makes this whole ordeal a bit darker than it already was, making the enemy Pokémon you fight in the Voidlands not *just* ordinary illusions, but rather they are the former souls of Pokémon that were long since sent to the Voidlands many years ago (that were never saved), molded into husks by the Void Shadows that know only to fight and consume. 

This means, in a way, that the Pokémon you fight really *are* illusions; because their former bodies are already well past saving, and their minds have been warped beyond recognition over the many centuries the Voidlands have existed to the point they're all basically Void Shadows with a fleshy exterior.

I figure that now that I finished 100%ing PSMD and all the games are still fresh on my mind, I could type this out.

Remember that this is all up to opinion and personal taste! And that 'antagonist' can apply to any Pokémon that opposed you and your partner, no matter how minor, from any of the PMD games (even if it's just a common, optional outlaw with no relevance to the main story!)

Here, I'm going to go over what I thought of some of the antagonists I liked throughout each game (the ones that mattered to me, at least). 

**Rescue Team:** 

* *Team Shiftry* - They were too simple for my tastes. Their only purpose in the main story was to show how much stronger you and your partner have gotten so far in the story. They had a lot more room for potential, and could've been expanded on a bit more, but for how short their arc was, it was still a bit heartwarming to see Shiftry start to change his wicked ways after Zapdos beats the shit out of him. I also have this headcanon that one of the Nuzleaf that worked for him later decided to go exploring on his own before settling down in Serene Village. This would explain where and how Dark Matter was able to bring his wicked side out during PSMD's main story.

* *Team Meanies* - These three were ridiculously over-the-top. They were decent rivals, but as villains, their goals made no sense and had no direction or sense of progression. They went from 0 to 100 in a heartbeat--from thinking stealing your mail would bring them one step closer to world domination, to stalking you and revealing your deepest secrets to everyone in town so they can chase you down and kill you. They had literally no legitimate motives for doing anything they did in the game--despite what their dialogue claims--and were just total assholes for the sake of being total assholes. 

Gengar in particular gets some slack because of his past with Gardevoir, though. It still doesn't excuse any of his actions during the main story, and personally, no matter what the Judge of Darkness might claim, I'd say Gengar's ""sense of gratitude"" was far from his only problem.

But I do like how, even though Gengar atoned for his sins against Gardevoir in the end, his story was still pretty bittersweet. Gardevoir may have gotten her physical form back, but she's lost all her memories of him, Gengar never gets his human form back, and he's still forced to stay in this world.

And he's okay with that. 

That alone shows how much he's matured over the course of the game, and it makes you imagine the amount of introspection he must have gone through ever since he eavesdropped on Gardevoir's conversation about her past with him in one of your dreams. Even if Gardevoir doesn't remember him, he's just happy she's alright.

It showed that some actions, no matter how corrupt or valiant, still have consequences, and sometimes, you just have to gain the maturity to deal with them. This was a concept the later PMD games seemed to flat-out ignore, with every game past Time/Darkness giving practically everyone their happy ending.

Gengar's arc also provides a counterargument to a dilemma Gates brings up--""If you do a good deed for someone, and they don't remember it, is it still worth doing?"" Gengar grows a backbone and ends up answering--albeit somewhat hesitantly at first--yes, to that question.

Gates, on the other hand, has you question it and doesn't seem to give you a definite answer, and decides to have everyone defy the laws of the universe to casually decide NOT forget you. That's something I was a bit iffy about.

**Explorers**

* *Drowzee* - He was a decent early-story villain. He helped introduce the new concept of Outlaws in the games, while also helping introduce Marill and Azurill, all while acting as your first step toward you and your partner growing as an Exploration Team. From a basic storytelling and gameplay perspective, he had a purpose and achieved it well.

And that's all to him, right? Just an ordinary, generic crook like all the other optional outlaws you'll face in the game? 

Nope.

The game goes above and beyond by bringing him back in the post-game, giving him a bit more depth by showing that he really did regret his past crimes and spent a lot of time rehabilitating atop Mt. Travail. And then, he more than makes up for his past wrongdoings by helping save Azurill from his nightmare and unintentionally saving you and your partner's lives when ""Cresselia"" attempted to murder you.

And after the whole Darkrai fiasco is over, he doesn't even ask for a ""thank-you""; he just leaves to go travel elsewhere again on his own.  I really like how they gave such a minor character this much development. It really surprised me.

Though even now, I wonder what kind of treasure was at the top of Mt. Bristle, or if there even was one at all...

He's up on this list because I wasn't expecting such a generic bad guy to be treated more like an actual living being instead of a cartoony archetype. 

* *Team Skull* - Speaking of cartoony archetypes... These three were just dumb. They're basically Team Meanies but better-written...minus some tragic backstory behind them to make their leader look good. 

They didn't have impossible, unrealistic goals like Team Meanies did. Rather than aiming for world domination through mundane tasks, they were just greedy and their actions were more down-to-earth. They were ALSO assholes for the sake of being assholes, but they went about it through better ways, imo. And they served as better rivals.

I also like the parallel structure of them going after the Relic Fragment at both the beginning and end of the story. And how the game INDIRECTLY shows that you've surpassed them in strength when you see them defeated by Kabutops in Brine Cave, rather than DIRECTLY spelling it out for you by having some boss battle with them earlier in the story.

Also, as a kid, I kind of assumed these three DIED off-screen, because they never show their faces again for the rest of the game. And their last moments together made it sound like those were their final words... Though PSMD completely debunked that headcanon. Strangely enough, I was actually happy to see these assholes return in the post-game. ♥

* *Dusknoir* - What can I say about him that hasn't been said already? He's cunning, manipulative, and like Gengar and Drowzee, had a lot of unexpected depth no one expected to see in a Pokémon game of all things. 

His betrayal was pretty obvious, though. Even as a kid playing Time/Darkness when they first came out, the main character's whole soliloquy about his ""faintest of smiles"" was a dead giveaway. Not to mention that awkward laugh (Hoo-hoo-ha!). Juxtaposed with Grovyle's constant apologies to the people he beats up? And how Grovyle picks up on how Dusknoir straight-up lies to everyone in Treasure Town when they're about to go back to the future?

But the thing was, I didn't WANT to believe Dusknoir was the bad guy. I thought it would've been cool to have a Ghost-type act as a good guy for once, defying type stereotypes. Especially with how cool he looked to my child self at the time and how much he helped you throughout the story. But I guess that just wasn't meant to be.

Then Special Episode 5 came and explained he did all of this out of desperate self-preservation, and made me like him a lot more. This also added a whole new layer of depth to his motives, making him even more of a foil to Grovyle in that neither of the things they did to survive were necessarily ""evil"", and were entirely realistic for anyone to resort to when living in the future they were forced to live in. 

Also, his last plan against Grovyle was absolutely METAL. Planning to gain his trust so he could lead him to a specific place halfway across the world that could kill him cleanly enough for him to use, inhabiting his corpse, impersonating him, and then taking out you and your partner in the past thinking Grovyle made it back okay? Jesus.

Part of me actually wished he and the other future Pokémon remained erased from history, though. The abrupt happy ending from Arceus was nice, but I felt it took away from Dusknoir's and the others' sacrifices a bit.

* *Primal Dialga* - Not much to say about him. I made a headcanon post here sometime ago, where I took advantage of the fact that Primal Dialga is never shown to say actual words and assumed Dusknoir planned everything of his own accord, justifying that he was ""ordered"" by Dialga so his conscience could bear all the terrible things he had to do to survive. 

Whether that headcanon has any truth to it or not, it's a fact that Primal Dialga does seem to be incapable of speech. While that does make him sound intimidating, along with his primordial motives, it makes me wonder how he's able to come up with such complicated plans, let alone hire henchmen and communicate to them. The Snorunt you see in Special Episode 5 clearly show the difference between a sane Pokémon and a primal Pokémon, so clearly they're incapable of things like that. Maybe it's telepathy we never get to see?

Oh well. He still served his purpose and was a great antagonist in the story, imo.

* *Darkrai* - He's probably the most cunning antagonist in the series overall. I liked the big reveal of him being the one behind everything from the start of the game, and I LOVED the inner conflicts he gave you and your partner in the post-game, making the both of you question the value of both of your lives over the safety of all the other Pokémon in the world. Even if it was all just an elaborate ruse.

Your partner even began to think suicide was the best option here!

Though what I wish we had was a MOTIVE for why Darkrai wanted to do all this. He says he's always wanted a world full of darkness, but why? Because he's pure evil? It's definitely a breath of fresh air from all the other sympathetic and asshole-ish villains we've had prior, but Wigglytuff seems to suggest otherwise. There's nothing we can suggest from anything in-game that Darkrai's anything BUT a villain of pure evil, aside from Wigglytuff's stated belief that no Pokémon is pure evil, so anything that suggests Darkrai had some legitimate reason to do what he did is pure headcanon.

And much like Team Skull's parallelism with the Relic Fragment, Darkrai got the karma he deserved when he ALSO got amnesia by getting hit with an attack while traveling inside a Dimensional Hole, much like what happened to you at the beginning of the game. It was a great way to conclude the story.

**Gates to Infinity** 

* *Munna and her gang* - She was an amazing antagonist. I liked how she used Rescue Team's plot elements against you--surely you'd think the cute Psychic-type Pokémon asking for help in your dreams would be on your side, right? 

Nope! Turns out she's the Dusknoir of this game. Only I'd say this betrayal was completely unexpected!

I also like how everyone in GtI is a sympathetic villain this time. Makes sense, given the theme of the whole game.

But the way she and her gang switch sides just like /that/ near the end was iffy for me. While your partner's convincing and reasoning made sense, I wish it didn't feel so rushed.

I also wish we weren't TOLD, but rather SHOWN why Munna and her gang did the terrible things they did. With Dusknoir, we SAW the dark future and how terrible it was for ourselves. We SAW Pokémon lose the remainder of their sanity, as we SAW the implied fate of many Pokémon that oppose Primal Dialga or fail to survive in this dark world. We weren't JUST told, ""Oh, hey, this is bad and it's making everyone feel bad, we need to stop it"".

In this game, more often than not, we were TOLD why we should feel bad for these characters. Especially with Munna and her gang. And it was at the last second, too!

Really wish there was at least some kind of Special Episode or something in the game that justified the stuff she and the others had to go through to want to restart the world like that. Oh well.

And as for the rest of her gang... They were just generic henchmen. Makes me wonder the things they went through that drove them to join Munna as well.

* *Kyurem* - He was okay. Having Kyurem be an overseer of the future was unexpected, considering he can't do that canonically in the main series games, and the PMD series has always done a good job at taking every Pokémon's abilities and PokéDex descriptions to heart when showing what each Pokémon can and can't do. I guess Kyurem's an exception to this for some reason?

Regardless, he's a terrible overseer anyway. Characters who constantly claim they can ""see all"" or ""see the future set in stone no matter what"" often go down the same route of being proven wrong because of some other characters' wit and determination or something along those lines.

We're also never given an insight as to how Kyurem sees the future. Maybe it's like Garnet's Future Vision where she only sees multiple outcomes and not definite paths, and Kyurem's seen so many terrible things in his lifetime that he's gotten depressed and all he COULD see were images of the Bittercold resetting everything? I dunno. I feel like that would help his case here. Regardless, he's later made to look like an idiot because of his insularity.

But I do give him props for being one of the most proactive Pokémon in the game when it came to trying to make his plans come into fruition. Most of the other villains in this series just sneak around and do everything in secrecy; Kyurem did that at first, but when he realized he wouldn't be able to keep the act up for long, he went AFTER anyone and everyone who could stop him and straight-up KILLED them. 

If Hydreigon had a legitimate physical form, he would be dead. And the other humans-turned-Pokémon would be, too, if their souls weren't automatically transported back to their human body when their Pokémon form was destroyed. This was one of the few instances Gates did a good job SHOWING rather than telling--if your partner hadn't intervened, those balls of light could've been us.

I like to imagine that some of the other humans had partners and made friends in the Pokémon world as well, but they either weren't around, were separated by Munna's gang, or failed to convince Kyurem to stop what he was doing when he did away with them. I could only imagine how traumatizing something like that could've been for those other Pokémon. 

* *The Bittercold* - The amalgamation of all the negative feelings of every Pokémon on the planet. With all the despair and hopelessness you've come across within all the Pokémon you've met throughout your journey, it felt pretty climactic to see the result of all of that come into fruition. 

I used to not like how the Bittercold wasn't sentient, as well as how it was treated more like an object of destruction over much else, but looking back on Kyurem's and Munna's motivations, I like it more for being just that. Especially with their choice of keeping it a secret and choosing to build it up at a faster rate so no one can stop its ascension.

**Super**

* *Nuzleaf, the Beheeyem, and Yveltal* - Another betrayal I didn't expect! His hints at him being ""evil"" were more subtle, and most players would completely miss them before they were all revealed for you so you could facepalm yourself for not realizing it sooner! 

I also love how he completely changed the trope of how most PMD games begin--not seeing your partner conveniently be there for me the moment you arrive definitely threw me for a loop!

Having a brainwashed villain was also certainly new, and I applaud the game for trying something completely new for the series. I don't dislike the idea, though part of me wishes Nuzleaf, the Beheeyem, and Yveltal were all at least somewhat willing to work for Dark Matter. But I guess I can see why they chose not to do it.

Yveltal already has the power to take lives at the drop of a hat and can ALREADY turn Pokémon to stone without outside help, so I guess making him the main villain would be a bit obvious. 

Making an embodiment of death look evil would also be the stereotypical choice in a game like this. So seeing Yveltal in a light that makes him look like he only takes lives because it's his job in the natural order of things was nice. I also like seeing him regret and feel remorse for his actions when you enter the Tree of Life, as well as when you meet up with him in the post-game, even though none of it was really his fault.

And as for the Beheeyem, I feel it was a waste of a plot twist to say it was one of the Beheeyem that gave you amnesia, when in reality it was self-inflicted. It was a HUGE waste of an opportunity that could've made the villains of this game cold and calculating, when in reality the main driving force of Nuzleaf's plan happened out of your own and your partner's accord. Oh well.

* *Krokorok and Krookodile* - When I first encountered them in the main story, I thought they were going to be a bit more significant than they really were. They were the only ones who supported the turning-to-stone incidents, and they were really the only Pokémon in Lively Town who weren't always so happy-go-lucky. 

I also find it weird how everyone acknowledges them as ""gangsters"" and criminals in the town, yet no law enforcement tries to do anything about them. They were just written there to stand out from everyone else and act like the biggest red herrings in the series (get it? Because Krookodile's red? Haaaaah).

Sure, it was cool to see Krookodile just singlehandedly DEMOMISH every guard and checkpoint up on Revelation Mountain, which shows how strong he is, as well as how he didn't seem to care that Raikou and Suicune were at his neck...AND how he was the one who revealed Nuzleaf's true intentions before being backstabbed and turned to stone.

But then those two just flip a 180 and gradually turn over a leaf in the post-game after they got themselves out of the Voidlands, and while their mini post-story is sweet (Krookodile x Miltank OTP), they felt like the Team Shiftry of this game. It made me see them more as plot devices used to advance the story rather than actual characters, for the most part.

* *Dark Matter* - The amalgamation of all the negative feelings of every Pokémon on the planet. With all the despair and hopelessness you've come across within all the Pokémon you've met throughout your journey, it felt pretty climactic to see--oh, wait, we saw none of that in this game.

While Dark Matter was foreshadowed and built up way back when you first enter the Voidlands, I still felt its appearance was a bit abrupt.

In fact, I'd even go so far to say it's the opposite of the Bittercold in some ways.

In Gates, the main villains had free will, and they were the ones controlling the Bittercold's growth. In Super, it's the opposite--Dark Matter is the one responsible for its own growth, taking the free will of its main villains to support it.

Dark Matter is also sentient. And it basically acted like what I figured the amalgamation of all Pokémon would act like...for the most part.

I just wish Dark Matter had more of a reason to justify why it wanted to destroy the Earth. Sure, it's been building itself back up since its previous defeat in ancient times, and talks about all the prejudices and wars it's seen over the years, but why does the present world have the suffer for it?

In Gates, we see how hopeless, broken, and corrupted a lot of Pokémon are. In Super...we don't. Pancham and Shelment are just innocently mischievous, the Litwick were just trying to survive, and Krokorok and Krookodile's stories weren't expanded upon as much for us to see why they're the only ones who believe the world ending is a good thing.

I guess I could count all the Pokémon who send outlaw/secret base Connection Orb missions as Pokémon who have unwittingly contributed to Dark Matter's growth, but none of them are relevant to the story and all of their missions are optional, so they don't contribute to the game's writing at all.

Oh well. I prefer Super's moral over Gates's, though--accepting others' negative emotions as natural, while trying not to let them affect others feels more realistic to me than trying to promote that we should all just feel hope and positivity as much as we can.

Especially when some Pokémon literally NEED negative emotions to survive. Litwick survive off of fear. Banette feed off of negativity. Those Pokémon (among many others) would surely die out if everyone did their best to stay happy-go-lucky 24/7.

Not all guesses and wishes have to be necessarily 'realistic', sounding like something exactly the developers would make, but some somewhat educated guesses would be nice.

Here are a few trends/traditions the M&amp;L series have established for reference: 

* The series is open to building up its antagonists throughout multiple games, and is open to continuity. [The first three games built up Fawful from a henchman, merchant, to main villain. And all five games so far have built Bowser up from a joke, minor villain, antihero, major villain, and now THE main villain. BIS also has a few cameos of the Shroobs from PiT, and Kylie Koopa and Popple show up as minor characters in DT.] (/spoiler)

* [Every final boss is some altered version of Bowser. Even if the story has little to do with him.] (/spoiler)

* Every game has some sort of unique twist or gimmick - [SS taking place in an entirely new and foreign kingdom, PiT traveling through time with the Bros' younger selves, BIS traveling in and out of Bowser's body while playing as Bowser, DT traveling in and out of Luigi's dreams, and PJ letting you play as Paper Mario and crossing over several elements from his world.] (/spoiler)

* Every game from BIS-onward has giant battles, or something similar.

With that in mind, I personally think the next game should involve Wario and Waluigi in some way. And maybe even some of the Wario Land and WarioWare characters, enemies, and locations.

I'm not against at least one of the Wario Bros. being playable as a begrudging ally in some way, but what I had in mind was them being *actual* antagonists in the game, just like old times.

And maybe some of the WarioWare characters could serve as bosses with actual dialogue; what I liked about Paper Jam was [how the Koopalings were more fleshed out and were given humorous interactions with each other, and weren't just dialogue-less minibosses like they were in Superstar Saga.] (/spoiler)

Seeing characters like Dy. Crygor, Ashley, and Mike interact with each other in a similar vain would be interesting to me. Maybe they could even be bosses in this, or at least antagonistic roadblocks in the story.

Another idea I had heard was the idea that the WarioWare characters could take the role as Special Attacks, if Wario was a playable character rather than a villain, after they had met over the course of the story. This idea is similar to how, in BIS, Bowser would free several different kinds of his minions in the overworld so he could be able to call on them for a Special Attack in battle (using Goombas, Koopas, Shy Guys, etc.). I really like that concept, honestly.

People have stated before that the first three games in the series have been building up Fawful's progression from henchman, to merchant, to main villain, and while that's true, /all FIVE/ games have also been building up someone else.

Bowser.

In Superstar Saga he's made out to look like a joke, in Partners in Time he's a minor villain, in Bowser's Inside Story he's an antihero, in Dream Team he's a major villain, and in Paper Jam he's THE main villain, to the point the entire game focuses around him.

It was like this whole series was his rise from rags to riches.

Also, every final boss in these games is some altered version of Bowser. 

Not only that, but each game also has a theme/gimmick with its gameplay. Superstar Saga took place in a new foreign kingdom, Partners in Time had you travel between past and future with the Bros' younger selves, Bowser's Inside Story had you travel in and out of Bowser's body while playing as Bowser, Dream Team traveling in and out of Luigi's dreams, and now Paper Jam takes several elements of the Paper Mario games and applies them to the Mushroom Kingdom.

So where do you think they'll go from here? This is all pure speculation and just fun discussion to have until the next one DOES drop. The above information was just things to keep in mind you wanted to make a more realistic prediction of what the next game might be like, but it doesn't have to follow the cut-and-paste trends the series has already established.

I personally think the next M&amp;L game should involve Wario and Waluigi in some way. And maybe even many of the other WarioWare characters.

Much like how the Koopalings got cameos in Superstar Saga and their time to shine as main characters in Paper Jam, I was thinking Mona, Dr. Crygor, Ashley, and the others could fill a similar role.

I also loved how the Koopalings got dialogue and expanded personalities in Paper Jam. Seeing that same treatment with Wario, Waluigi, and the other WarioWare characters and having them work off each other would be amazing.

And Waluigi just needs more recognition in general.

The plot I haven't thought out yet, but I GUESS it could involve Bowser and Peach in some way if it really had to.

But yeah, that's my guess.

The Ancient Barrow and Tree of Life--as well as the events that take place in them--are actually pretty similar and serve to show how your partner learns from the mistakes they made in the ancient past.

* Both dungeons involve you and your partner fighting for the freedom of those you care about that were held captive by their respective bosses.

* In both instances, your partner put aside his fears in place of hope and determination. 

* At the end of both dungeons, the boss at the end (the Litwick gang and Dark Matter) grew stronger through others' misery. 

* And in both instances, your partner defeated the boss by accepting it.

* Not to mention, both bosses at the end of both dungeons have an intimidating-looking façade, only to later reveal their less-intimidating, spherical true forms (""Giratina"" to Solosis and Dark Matter's outer shell to Dark Matter's true core). 

* Both dungeons are also literally entered through a tree. 

* And the cutscenes in which your partner 'accepts' both bosses begins the exact same way--with them humorously and abruptly interjecting themselves into the conversation and then giving them their two cents on what should be done.

* Even the same music plays in both cutscenes--the music box version of your Partner's Theme.

* Lastly, both dungeons cannot be visited again once their story relevance is done. They can only be revisited from the outside in the overworld (and through Pelipper Island, but that's beside the point).

And while I'm on this topic, I've heard many say your partner's fear of ghosts is also tied in to their previous failure against Dark Matter, or because of type advantage (since they're Mew), but I don't think that's entirely accurate.

Here's why:

* Dark Matter embodies every single Pokémon. It isn't purely a Ghost-type. In battle, it changes its type nearly every turn. Many just don't notice because Alliance Attacks ignore type disadvantage. And spamming them makes battles easier.

* That, and Espurr loves ghosts, and she's a Psychic-type as well. So it's clearly not because of type advantage.

So your partner's just a huge wuss.

But anyway, this whole comparison between these two dungeons also goes to show that the first half of the game isn't as filler-y and pointless as I've heard some people make it out to be.

If the first half of the game (the whole arc in Serene Village) wasn't spent introducing its cast of characters and foreshadowing future events to the extent that it did, then your partner's motivations, Nuzleaf's intentions, and Espurr's involvement wouldn't have been as clear and properly-paced out.",MysteryDungeon,SPMD's Parallel Structure (Spoilers All Throughout Post),https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteryDungeon/comments/44estq/spmds_parallel_structure_spoilers_all_throughout/

I wrote the gist of this a while back and copy-pasted it here to see what some of you might think of it. If it has any holes or is in need of any criticism at all, let me know! Much of what is said here--about Meowstic (M) being fond of mischief and Meowstic (F) wanting to put a stop to it--is based off their dialogue in their separate Connection Orb missions. And around halfway through the story, Espurr implies that [spoilers](#s ""she's an orphan, while the other schoolkids talk about how their parents were worried for them after the ""Giratina"" incident."")  Other details I mentioned are also just strictly from my imagination, like Simipour being relevant.)

Espurr's father was a notorious prankster, who loved the thrill of making mischief and inflicting harm onto others. He was the adventurous type, loving to explore areas outside the town he was raised in and loved taking risks. Her mother was the opposite--she was more indifferent when it came to mischief-making and was much more reserved, maintaining an outward air of seriousness wherever she went, usually disliking the thought of traveling very far unless she had to. The two eventually met, opposites attracting and compromising their differences, becoming a strong exploration duo, achieving several feats and soon beginning to make somewhat of a reputation of themselves in the world. 

Some years later, the two found themselves in the Water Continent, traveling around an area some miles close to Serene Village. Meowstic-F was pregnant with Espurr, at a stage where she mulled over the thought of settling down in the nearest settlement nearby to run a family. Meowstic-M, not wanting to end his glory days of adventure and mischief, disagreed with the idea and wished for the three of them to become an exploration trio, spending the rest of their lives nomadically causing trouble and finding treasure. Argument after argument ran through the couple, so much so that it came to the point where compromise became difficult, their polar opposite personalities and dreams now repelling each other. Neither could agree on what was best for the both of them from here on--nor what was best for Espurr. 

Meowstic-M soon came to the conclusion that it was best that they split up. Making one last concession between them, he let out a sigh and escorted his wife to Serene Village, helping her build a home for her and Espurr before his leave. Discreetly, he left the village the night he finished, wishing for no one to remember his existence here, and leaving Meowstic-F in her sleep as he soon fled to the Mist Continent, hoping to lay low, eliminate everything about his former reputation, and begin his life anew, causing mischief however he pleased in more isolated areas. 

Some days later, Meowstic-F had released her Egg, distraught that her husband had left her and the village without even a good-bye. Her eyes began to water, and so, she spent the next several months in a deep depression over her loss, her main lifeline residing in her daughter, taking care of her Egg with everything she had. Outside, she kept her usual, stoic demeanor, but inside, her eyes were soon filled with hate and disgust, and an intolerance of mischief grew in her. She was unable to let go of her ex-husband's foolishness. Her psychic powers became less constrained, her negative emotions getting the best of her. Knowing it wouldn't be best to raise her daughter while in this state, she soon decided to venture off on a solo journey away from the village as well. 

She begged the villagers to never mention anything of her and her ex-husband for the sake of her daughter not ending up as vengeful or selfish as her parents. She brought her Egg to the village school, asking Principal Simipour to take care of her until she hatched, and immediately ran off. 

The village was unsure of what to do. In all its years of peace, no one had ever faced a situation anything like this one. Simipour honored Espurr's parents wishes, raising Espurr to become independent and strong, hoping she would grow to inherit both of her parents' positive traits rather than those that were more negative. He, together with the rest of the village, agreed to keep Espurr's parents a secret in fear of her or any other Pokémon following their example. With that, Espurr was granted the ability to live in her own home at age 7, alone, left to assume it was the villagers that found her Egg and built her own home, knowing nothing of her parents or any other family. Overtime, villagers came and went, and before long, the majority of the Serene Village's population was filled with new Pokémon who knew nothing of Espurr's past. 

Meowstic-M secluded himself in Noe Town, by day resuming his life of mischief, and by night, inwardly lamenting over what he had done. 12 years after he left Serene Village, he had eventually heard word of [spoilers](#s ""Espurr's exploits with Lively Town's Expedition Society and her role in saving the world from Dark Matter."")  He secretly keeps tabs on her occasionally to this day, watching over her though his Connection Orb, wanting to meet his daughter...but afraid of the effect it may have on her. 

Meowstic-F was eventually able to regain control over her psychic powers and emotions, and soon made new acquaintances far away from Serene Village. She does not want to have anything to do with her past, practically living as a completely different Pokémon now. To this day, she continue to feel twinges of loathing inside her, and continues to have a lack of tolerance for anything related to mischief.

I've heard a lot about how Rescue Team's, Gates's and PSMD's plot leaves a lot to be desired about its cast of characters, so I'd like to know what people think the overall story could improve if all three of these games pulled an Explorers of Sky and added a ton of character depth, backstory, and just fun, new scenarios for certain characters.

In Time/Darkness, the Guild felt bland and useless. Wigglytuff and Chatot were the only two members that were relevant and actually TRIED to do something relevant in the story. The others...showed up a LOT, but they never did anything useful. Not only that, but some of them had little to no personality or depth, speaking solely in catch phrases and verbal tics.

Plus, they introduced a TON of new Exploration Teams, but never did anything overly-worthwhile with them. Sure, some of them had little side-stories you could read about through idle NPC dialogue over the course of the game, but some of them were hyped up by other NPCs to be a lot more important than they really were.

In Sky, they fixed that a bit. They made Bidoof more likable, established a lot about Wigglytuff's backstory and previous adventures, gave Loudred and Sunflora a cute story that showed the Guild CAN work as a competent team on their own, and allowed other Exploration Teams like Team Charm and Team AWD to get the spotlight. And does Special Episode 5 even NEED to be elaborated on at this point?

So what if this treatment was applied to all the other PMD games? This all makes for great headcanon and fanfic material for others to share.

So here are some of my ideas! (These are all rough drafts, so they need plenty of polishing and editing. I also don't have all my ideas for each game and each character fully typed out and elaborated on this post yet due to time constraints. Will be added upon and edited heavily in the future, overtime.):

Rescue Team - 

1. One that focuses on Team Shiftry. 

It could show some of their past misdeeds toward other Pokémon that weren't shown during the main story, showing the team's greed and devotion to exert themselves to rise above the rescue ranks to get recognition. Shiftry himself had been jealous of Team ACT's quick rise to success, and, feeling inferior after hearing report after report of their exploits, only grew more and more bitter.

His two Nuzleaf compatriots talk about their leader's behavior alone, and one Nuzleaf that worked under him tries to talk him out of some of their methods of earning Rescue Points, only to be silenced.

It would then cut to when Alakazam forced Shiftry personally to save the Jumpluff at Chasm Cave, as well as him getting beaten and saved from Zapdos, making him turn over a new leaf. (Literally.)

And how he assembles a team specially formed to save Team ACT from Groudon.

It could then show Shiftry's desire to forge a new beginning for himself and for other Pokémon, deciding to disband his team to become a lone explorer after Rayquaza and your hero/partner save the world, and thanking Nuzleaf for trying to snap him out of his jerk-phase when he did. 

That same Nuzleaf that worked for him had grown to enjoy their adventures together as a team, through the good and the bad, bidding a tearful farewell as their laid-back leader leaves him, leaving said Nuzleaf to go out on his own and wander the world himself...later to find that the narrator of this whole episode had been none other than the Nuzleaf in PSMD, in which the MC and your partner had asked him about some of the adventures he had when he was younger.

2. One that focuses on Team Meanies and Gardevoir.

An episode that could tell how the trio met, their interactions with each other after Gengar saw Gardevoir in the player's dream, and how the team would later meet Gardevoir personally, eventually leading to its disbandment. Medicham would end up befriending Gardevoir as the two spent more and more time together. 

Gardevoir would mention the idea of forming a team, much like she does when she asks to join the player's team in Pokémon Square, only now she begins to want to start a three-Pokémon team of her own. Medicham, after doing her best to move past all the times she enjoyed with Gengar and Ekans, later agrees, and the two set off to travel together for now, into another continent.

The two girls bid farewell to Gengar and Ekans, who also bid their separate ways.",MysteryDungeon,"If Rescue Team, Gates, and PSMD had Special Episodes...",https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteryDungeon/comments/43dhd1/if_rescue_team_gates_and_psmd_had_special_episodes/

He's completely oblivious to it for the entire game despite being the Pokémon that lives closest to it.

Your partner even has to make him LOOK UP for him to go, ""Oh SHIT, I probably shouldn't have wasted all that time trying to beat you guys up. My bad.""

Flash forward several years later into Super Mystery Dungeon, and [spoilers](#s ""Rayquaza is the FIRST one to hear about Dark Matter, and straight-up BOOKS IT out of the planet, almost like he's learned from his past mistakes so he won't have to be the one to deal with end-of-the-world b/s all over again."") 

This might not have been intentional continuity on the writers' part, but it was just something funny I noticed. Also love how [spoilers](#s ""Deoxys and Rayquaza end up teaming up near the end of the game to stop Dark Matter together, while in Rescue Team, Rayquaza was the one who blasted the meteor Deoxys was in into a million pieces.

And I decided to do some digging of my own. I ran into an article XKAN of Kantopia wrote that compared the English and Japanese versions of a scene earlier on in the game, and later asked if they could look into a couple other scenes that happen later on. (I've only studied enough basic Japanese to read Hiragana, Katakana, some Kanji, and one year's worth of beginner textbook phrases and grammar points so far, so I wouldn't be much help at all alone).

It's been a trend for people on the Internet to unashamedly (and occasionally somewhat ignorantly) bash and degrade the English translators should even the SLIGHTEST thing be off with a translation from any Japanese form of media (whether it's an anime, manga, video game, etc.). Luckily I haven't really seen that type of attitude around this sub, so I figured it'd be cool to show off these minor differences just for knowledge's sake.

So this should answer a lot of people's questions about the English translation of the game so far! Comment below (or on XKAN's articles) what you think of these changes, and show some support to XKAN for their work on getting through the game to find and analyze these specific cutscenes! 

XKAN did an amazing job and definitely deserves some love for the work they put in for doing their research on this game. Definitely check out more of their stuff! They've also covered some FE: Fates topics recently as well. A ton of juicy localization controversy's going on there.

103,2016-01-28 06:12:36+00:00,self.MysteryDungeon,https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteryDungeon/comments/4322hs/how_does_primal_dialga_communicate/,False,"In-game, Primal Dialga only speaks in growls and roars, yet Dusknoir specifically seems to understand him perfectly. Dusknoir even mentions that Dialga likes to plan and order his underlings around to prevent history from changing.

Yet it's also been stated that the Pokémon of the future who have been corrupted by darkness...have their minds corrupted to the point they are incapable of reason and rational thinking. Meaning they act solely on instinct. Hence Primal Dialga's name. Primal.

In Special Episode 5, we see other examples of Pokémon whose minds have been warped from living in the dark future for too long--via a Mamoswine, a pack of Glalie, and even a sole Snorunt who loses the very last shred of sanity it had left.

All of them are shown to be incapable of speech--especially the Snorunt, who we see manage an actual conversation only to later lose his mind and only speak in odd grunts from then on.

This confirms that Primal Dialga is no better. So if he's supposed to have the mind of what is assumedly a wild animal, how is he able to plan out these convoluted plots to stop Grovyle and the others from changing history?

At one point in the game, Dusknoir even has a casual conversation with him atop Temporal Tower and acts like he understood every word Dialga said, when his only response was ""GRRRR."" At first I thought this entire exchange was hilarious, but then something clicked in my mind.

My assumption is that Dialga DOESN'T do any of the planning, and is INCAPABLE of speech and thinking at all, while Dusknoir himself is the Head of Operations here, merely pretending to be able to intelligently understand what his ""Master"" orders him as a way of coping with his existence, as a means of trying to keep his sanity and mental well-being intact.

By simply convincing himself that he was being ordered, Dusknoir would be able to go about doing the horrible things he had to do to survive with a clearer conscience. 

Case in point: In Special Episode 5, Dusknoir claims Primal Dialga is going to send another agent back to the past to finish what he started.

We're tricked into believing Dusknoir's Sableye have all been working under this ""new agent"" now, to the point they would pursue and attack Dusknoir himself.

... When it turns out that it was all a ruse designed by Dusknoir to use Grovyle's husk of a body to travel back in time and go through with the planet's paralysis. And that Dialga actually planned nothing of the sort.

If he was willing to have his own MINIONS attack him for the sake of his own self-preservation, then surely Dusknoir was beginning to get desperate.

Not to mention that Dialga only seemed to be drawn to the Passage of Time on Frozen Island out of instinct, because of his link to time. So warping there and destroying it without much thought to anything else sounds about accurate to what any animal would do to survive.

But capturing Celebi, hiring Spiritomb as a scapegoat, and luring Grovyle into an area that would kill him cleanly enough so his corpse could be used as a husk that would allow Dusknoir to blend in the past and sabotage Temporal Tower all over again?

Sounds like something only someone as intelligent as Dusknoir would plan out all on his own, out of his OWN insanity and desperation.

This adds a sort of tragedy to the character, showing that even the most seemingly sane of Pokémon in this dark future have an element of insanity in them.

104,2016-01-28 03:28:05+00:00,self.pokemonconspiracies,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/431g8e/blues_raticate_didnt_die/,False,"I think the theory that Blue's Raticate ""died"" is kinda silly. Here's why:

-Pokémon games never try to paint the main character in a bad light in any way, shape, or form because they're supposed to be /you/. As dark as the series can get at times, they'd never try to make you look like the bad guy in a /main series/ game. They're all mute, personality-less husks for a reason--because Red, Ethan, Brendan, Lucas, Hilbert, Nate, Calem (and their female counterparts, of course, as long as they're being controlled by the player)... They're all /you/.

-Not only that, but on the S.S. Anne, Blue says he caught over 30 Pokémon. Meaning he has plenty of other Pokémon at his disposal besides the ones in his party--either for PokéDex fodder or for future use to train later.

-And in Pokémon Tower, he says he specifically came there to catch a Cubone. To fill his PokéDex. His dialogue is pretty mean-spirited toward the dead Marowak here as well, shrugging and figuring there aren't any left, meaning he knew that Team Rocket killed at least one in the area. No gripes or remorse over the dead. 

-And he hardly seems the type to bottle his emotions up over something like this, too. In Gen 2, he could barely bottle up his feelings toward the natural disaster that destroyed Cinnabar Island. So why would he bottle up his feelings toward you killing his Raticate--even if it was an accident? Because there are no feelings to bottle up. His Raticate isn't dead. He came to Lavender to fill in more pages in his PokéDex--and maybe mess with you for a bit--and nothing more.

-Remember that Gen 1 was the only gen that actually did everything in its power to make you WANT to complete your PokéDex as if it were an integral part of the game, since Prof. Oak himself asked you do THAT to fulfill his lifelong dream, NOT beat all the Gyms. Beating the Gyms and the Pokémon League was just something the player and your rival came to pursue on their own prerogative. It's also why your rival would show off how many Pokémon he's caught to you every now and then, and why Oak's aides would promise you rare items as an incentive for you to catch more Pokémon.

-Now cut forward to his Champion battle dialogue. He says, ""While working on my Pokédex, I looked all over for powerful Pokémon! Not only that, I assembled teams that would beat any Pokémon type!"" 

Meaning he most likely just stuffed his Raticate in the PC and substituted it for one of his stronger Pokémon. I mean, hey, an Alakazam, Rhydon, Arcanine, Gyarados, etc. all sound MUCH stronger than a simple Raticate, right? Not to mention he gets a Tyranitar in Johto! (And in FR/LG's post-game, where again, he challenges you to try to catch every new Pokémon the Sevii Islands has to offer.)

-And while this isn't a specific example from the games THEMSELVES, in Pokémon Origins, it basically flat-out confirms Blue wasn't lying when he said he's been working on the PokéDex. You find out he's caught every Pokémon in the Dex except for Mewtwo, the latter of which he failed in capturing.

-When Prof. Oak says that Blue ""forgot to trust and love his Pokémon"" after you beat him at the end of the game, he just means he got too caught up in winning and trying to be the very best (like no one ever was) rather than simply enjoying his journey and bonding with his team, like Red presumably does.

-Blue doesn't get wrapped up in revenge against Red. He doesn't feel any seething jealousy toward him just because his grandfather gives him more attention sometimes.

He's just a cocky asshole that mellows out overtime after Red beats him enough to the point he learns some humility. And not much else.

-And yes, while there is a line exclusively in FR/LG that specifically has Blue say, ""Hey, I heard that! Gramps, what's with favoring Red over me all the time? I went and collected more Pokémon and faster, too. You should just let me handle everything,"" he was just being naturally salty. Anyone would after having their title taken away five minutes after obtaining it.

-Prof. Oak even responds with, ""I know, I know. Of course I need your help, too,"" in mild jest to comfort him.

There are many theories out there that make for really great headcanons or AUs IF Blue's Raticate HAD died, but none of them have really given me enough support to make me believe they could be even the tiniest bit canon.

I realize some of my support against this theory isn't anything relatively new that's already been discussed before, but I've seen so many comments buying into this theory assuming it's the most in-depth, closest-to-canon thing they've heard when the most evidence I've read that supports it is, ""The Raticate was in his party in one battle...and it WASN'T in the next! AND Blue was standing by a grave! Red's a murderer!"" 

I don't know. I'd like to know what other people that believe this theory think. This theory just has so many holes in it for me to believe.",pokemonconspiracies,Blue's Raticate Didn't Die??,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/431g8e/blues_raticate_didnt_die/

You end up escorting him into the depths of Murky Cave, where he gets judged for his sins when a certain entity asks you a series of questions about him...

The Judge of Darkness is another non-Pokémon entity in the PMD series, along with the Voice of Life, Bittercold, and [spoilers](#s ""Dark Matter""). It's actually the first known non-Pokémon entity revealed in the series, and with its short appearance and lack of lore surrounding it, most people tend to forget or overlook that it even exists.

What is the Judge of Darkness? Is it its own entity, or can it somehow be related to the other three non-Pokémon entities that are revealed in later games?

As a kid playing through the Rescue Team games for the first time, I always assumed it was just Ninetails putting up an elaborate act to get Gengar to talk and learn his lesson. Which explains why she conveniently happened to be there right after Gardevoir was revived to congratulate him.
