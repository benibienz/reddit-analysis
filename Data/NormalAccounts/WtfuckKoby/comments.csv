6,"To be honest, I had a really hard time with OoK also. He's pretty insane when he gets frenzied, I used the 2 handed version of Ludwigs holy blade. And then when he's about to transform hit him hard enough to stun him and he won't transform, he'll try a few times but you can repeatedly stop it. That was easiest for me, hope it helps!",2016-05-03 06:58:59+00:00,d2qr216,1,t3_4hdkhj,102785,bloodborne

8,"I notice most people are better at dodging or parrying. So it's usually based off which you do more naturally, I dodge more than party naturally so I find the cleric beast easier than papa g. I've always had an easier time with the fights that are more based on better timed dodging, and worse at party based combat (like hunters).
That's just from what I've seen through Reddit and personal play throughs though.",2016-04-08 14:07:55+00:00,d1uwrrm,1,t3_4du22k,48597,bloodborne
