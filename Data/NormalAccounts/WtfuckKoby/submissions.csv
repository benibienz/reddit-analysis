This is also the first time I've completed a From game, and I'm truly amazed.

This has easily been one of the best game communities I've seen, but also this game has easily made my top 5. This game was amazing and I'm definitely not done playing even though I have the plat. 

Gotta say some of my favorite moments are helping people with the defiled bosses in coop, and beating the crap out of bosses while feeling like I'm on the cusp of dying. 

Anyways thanks to this community for helping me reach my platinum, couldn't have done it without you!",bloodborne,Platinum feels so good.,https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/4ah0p0/platinum_feels_so_good/

I've done the Watchdog at least 50 times. This guy is seriously the worst, I have a love hate relationship with this boss. But holy shit he's hard with half health..
Wasted some insight, wasted a lot of time. Seriously how the hell does this one go down?
