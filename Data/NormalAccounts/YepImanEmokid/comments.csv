124,"Official Rulebook excerpt:
If the quarterback or the receiver of the snap demonstrates no further intention to pass the ball (i.e., hands off or pitches the ball to another player, throws a forward or backward pass, loses possession of the ball by a muff that touches the ground or a fumble, or if he is tackled) the restrictions on the defensive team prohibiting illegal contact, or an illegal cut block, against an eligible receiver will end, and a defensive player is permitted to use his hands, arms, or body to push, pull, or ward off an offensive receiver, pursuant to Rule 12, Section 1, Article 5. If the quarterback leaves the pocket area with the ball in his possession, the restrictions on illegal contact and an illegal cut block both end, but the restriction on defensive holding remains in effect.


There are two main IMPORTANT points here:
The QB coming out of the pocket does NOT give DB's the right to start laying people out. They are now allowed to push and pull with their arms and body in order to ward off an offensive receiver but running up to a WR thats not even looking at you or even running at you and laying them out IS ILLEGAL and at the very least a personal foul.
Even after the QB comes out of the pocket the restriction for defensive holding REMAINS IN EFFECT. This means that the hit that knocked Woods off his route and kept him from getting to the ball (timing route) was in fact defensive holding. Depending on what I see from the all-22 when its released it could even be defensive pass interference because hitting a player that is heading for where the ball will be while its in the air is still PI even if the QB is out of the pocket as well.
Once again, people keep on trying to say that because the QB is out of the pocket its the Wild Wild West. Seems that's only the case in Seattle.


TL:DR it wasn't legal, he's a shitstain

Week 2 got Greg Roman fired for Christ's sake I think anyone who believes that game is on the defense is an idiot. And in Miami we abandoned the run because of an injured McCoy being ineffective and a frustrating lack of trust in Gillislee, leading to near constant 3 and outs. Our defense he'll believe until late in the 3rd quarter, at which point they started giving up plays based on fatigue. 



No, our secondary has not been playing well. Gilmore sucks and our bullheaded attempts to stick to man coverage are infuriating, but our front 7 is one of the best in football and just tossing the blame for our shortcomings on the Defense as a whole is doing them a great disservice.

So funny that the narrative going in to this game was the poor poor Seahawks getting dicked by the zebras, then they get gifted a game. ~~Also, Sherman's making it really hard to keep liking him, but as long as he keeps sticking it to Goodell I won't say I completely hate his ass.~~ Richard Sherman can choke on Goodell's chode. His fucking ass deserves a suspension.

Karlos isn't a huge loss with how deep at RB we are, and Dareus wasn't a big factor last season so i don't think being without him for 4 (hopefully appealed to 2) games is a huge deal either. Our offense having another year together will be the huge deal this season. Offense wins games. And on the Defensive side, our secondary is great so I expect us having a good pass D even without the front seven getting a ton of pressure.

1767,"They haven't diclosed the details yet, but looking at his old contract he has 11.5M guaranteed in 2016, I'm sure at the very least a big chunk of that got spread out among his following 3 years. 

Speculation from the OP:
 &gt;Clay, who was signed as a transition player last offseason, was due a $10M roster bonus next month and had a cap figure of $13.5M according to Spotrac.com. It’s likely that the new restructured deal turned that into a signing bonus allowing Buffalo to amortize that amount over the life of the contract, which originally had four years remaining counting the 2016 season.  Such a move would cut Clay’s cap figure by more than 50 percent.",2016-02-26 00:51:59+00:00,d0dzwcb,2.0,t1_d0dzpid,306.0,nfl

My thoughts with making yellow the primary color instead of blue is taking into consideration the Chargers becoming roommates. A yellow jersey would allow the old colors to come back without forcing the Chargers to rebrand completely. It would be a mix of new and old, and a good compromise. Win/win/win.

2635,"I think the first 2/3 of JJ were as good, if not better, than Daredevil. The final 3rd of the series was borderline bad though. So where did it go wrong? The final act of the series just cluttered itself too much for me. 

The last 5 episodes seem to me to be were the show went to shit. As it started rushing, rather early in my opinion, to wrap itself up it continued introducing new information. We got shady organizations and elements of pretty much everyone's childhood. Kilgrave's childhood in particular felt out of place and contributed heavily in ruining his until that point very good character. He was menacing because he was unpredictable and mysterious. Shoehorning in an explanation for his actions and intents is bad writing and made the character fall flat on his face for the finale. 

I can't help to think that all this unnecessarily clunky, out of place information should have been left on the cutting room floor. Had they used the time and energy spent on all that exposition bullshit to instead write a more satisfying, mysterious final act, the show would've been miles ahead of daredevil. Sadly they didn't, and it wasn't.

4280,"&gt; NYJ and BUF have absolute bums playing the most important position on the field.

We don't know what Tyrod brings, but he looks good so far. Fitz isn't awful. No, we're not in great positions, but I wouldn't say either team is fielding bums either. 

&gt; The Bills also have a terrible offensive line and will probably ~~digress~~ regress (FTFY)  defensively.

We have a great OL coach and have added serious talent to our line. Have you watched any of our PS games? The 1s are solid. And as for our D, we just picked up one of the best Defensive coaches in football to bolster our #2 overall defense. We'll be fine. 

&gt; The Jets will be a bottom 5 offense in football and are already dealing with injuries and suspensions on defense.

The Jets are just as stacked as we are at offensive skill positions. A semi-competent OC will keep them out of the basement.  

&gt; Miami will be the 2nd best team in this division. 

Joe Philbin, a poor O-Line and a poor secondary say otherwise. It also remains to be seen if their overhauled offense functions as well as last year's group.

5684,"EJ was drafted as a project, and he was supposed to sit his first year. Kolb got hurt (career ender) before the season began and EJ was forced to start. Even though he was rough, he looked decent to promising. He ended up getting injured after 10 games, not starting again until the beginning of the past season. He looked a little gun shy and was a lot more reluctant to use his legs, but he still wasn't terrible. Leading the team to 2-2 (which could've easily been 3-1 had we actually decided to plan for JJ Fuckin' Watt) after the Texans game he hit the pine and we haven't seen him sense. 

**Why I have faith**: He's had good showings with some flashes of greatness (panthers game comes to mind), and this was without a QB coach. His biggest problems are accuracy and the inability to go through his reads. The accuracy problem didn't really start to rear its head until after he was hurt and forced to stay in the pocket, and to remedy the issue he's changed up his throwing motion. As for the reads, he was picked as a project, and he had no QB coach. I still believe it can be coached into him.

Marvels already shown that they're trying to appease them with things like the new cap, or ""Thor."" I'm just worried that after SW ends there's gonna be a lot of race and gender swapping to appeal to the tumblrcorps and it's going to destroy marvel and lose a large portion of their more sensible fans that can see through the pandering.
