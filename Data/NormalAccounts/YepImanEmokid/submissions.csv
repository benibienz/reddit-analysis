So I placed in comp around the 2300 mark, going 5-5 in my placement matches. Not my best work seeing that I was consistently high 50s to low 60s last season of comp, but hey, I solo queued all 10. Directly after placement I went on a 3 game winning streak, making easy work of my opponents. Well that was all fine and dandy until I decided to run with my friend (who just hit rank 25 eligibility) as he placed, dropping 4 in a row, I didn't sweat it much, I was trying to teach him the meta a bit and wasn't really expecting to do all that well. My issues arose shortly after. I was floating around the 2100 area and couldn't rise for the life of me. I'd play 5 matches, winning 3 and losing 2 and end up in basically the exact same spot even though i was winning more than i lost &amp; consistently getting golds &amp; cards. Well last night my internet unexpectedly cut out and it was treated as leaving the match and this morning i started with a couple losses. my matches are now full of silvers who refuse to communicate and cooperate and I feel like im in a rut, I've consistently been delivering 3+ gold metal games but I've been losing, and as such losing rank. I'm floating aroud 1800 now and feel kind of fatigued. The players that do have mics are toxic as all hell, matches are plagued with people leaving and the idea of teamwork is a joke. My strat entering matches is ""try to carry"" and more often than not it doesn't work. and on top of that I cant queue with my normal group any more because they're all too high now for me to join.

#I'm sure I'm not the only one who's kind of stuck in ELO hell now as we dive into season 2, lets talk about a possible way to fix it:

- CS:GO recalculates skill tier after every 2 wins, and as far as I can tell (I haven't played all that much comp counterstrike admittedly) personal performance is a much larger factor compared with wins and losses. In CS you can topfrag by a large margin and lose a few before those 2 victories, yet find yourself in a higher tier after cooldown. I think this sort of system is a bit more fair to the player. 

**On to my idea**: What about the ability to redo your placement matches at the cost of some competitive points. At present they're only being used to purchase gold weapons with. Why not let the players who feel like they haven't quite gotten a fair shake spend a hundred or so of them to roll the dice and see if they can end up ranking closer to where they feel that they belong.


#tl;dr - it's way too easy to find yourself sliding in rank and, being on the receiving end, it doesn't really feel that fair. Wins and losses are a *team stat* yet seem to be by far the largest margin in deciding *individual* skill placement for Competitive Overwatch. I dont think its fair to lose a ton of points trying to carry sightseers to victory.
