178,"The first phase goes poorly. Despite the attempts of the commanders to use the element of surprise, the Xinjiang scouts are well prepared at the border, due to them building up on the border for an attack on the Ma Family months earlier. The troops clumsily march in during a cold night and are spotted.

The Xinjiang forces are clustered about in the north and quickly press against the attackers. Cavalry descends down from mosques in the mountains are slice the communist forces to ribbons. The communist forces fall back after a few days of tough fighting.

In the south, the Communist forces are unopposed, but for good reason. They've been marching around in desert inhabited only by a few nomads. Supplies dwindle quickly here, but they press on.

CPC losses: 8k

The second phase is about as bad as the first. The decision to combine the three forces into two large ones is a mixed plan.  Seventeen-thousand troops head south into the desert to merge with the southern force, and lose men on this voyage not due to raids but due to lack of supplies. When they meet up with the southern forces, a desperate raid is carried out on local towns and villages by soldiers low on supplies. This causes the local population to hate the Communist invaders, and news of their barbarism quickly spreads through the south.

In the north another attack is carried out, but this time the Xinjiang forces wait for them in defensive positions. The Battle of the Silk Road is a brutal one, with both sides taking tremendous losses. In the end, the Communist forces cannot occupy they region, so they are forced to withdraw.

The raids are carried out, swiftly and easily for the most part. In the east, propaganda is spread well and a few adventurous Mongols agree to follow the army back to Mongolia as the army pushes back local guards.

But in the west, the Muslim ruler of Xinjiang is well prepared to fight back. Not much has happened, and his soldiers are itching for a fight. When the Mongols arrive, they are booted out faster than they rode in.

Mongol losses: 300

##Phase 2

Mongol forces move in for the second attack on the mostly-weakened enemies. The Ma Family and the Clique fall quite easily as their troops barely put up any resistance. Diplomats from these provinces are rumored to have run to the central government for support.

In the west, trouble brews again with Xinjiang forces holding back Mongol attackers and even launching a counterattack! As the Mongols retreat, the Muslims follow and occupy a few border towns.

---

On the streets of Poland, recruiters sigh in frustration as they fail to find the large numbers needed to fill their quotas. Despite promises of glory, adventure, and exotic dancers grinding up on them, Poles just don't want to join the army after many years of war [10/20][1/20][5/20].

**North**

Polish officers in the trenches, likely angry at the lack of men, want nothing more than to just sit in in their cot and drink away in peace due to the upcoming battle. But they get no relaxation, as Soviet guns bomb their positions all night long. Men from both sides are now cranky, scared, tired, or a combination of them.

Despite the lack of sleep, the Poles are wide-eyed and awake for the battle, possibly due to the thousand-yard-stare [18/20]. Soviet troops, again facing another mass charge, are less excited than the Poles [11/20].

Then the battle begins. After a heavy night bombardment, all the Soviet forces charge at once, resulting in chaos [5/20]. Some men are trampled by boots, others are cut by friendly bayonets, a handful and crushed by tank treads, and one man is reportedly killed after being stomped on by a mad horse.

And that's not the worst of it. As soon as the Soviets reach the Polish lines, they are subject to enemy machine gun-, rifle-, and artillery- fire.

But that doesn't stop them. When such a large force charges at a smaller one, it's unlikely they'll fail. Soviet troops pour into the trench like water spilling into a trough, killing the Polish defenders there [91/100]

In a desperate attempt to retake the trenches, Polish guns start bombing their former defenses to little tiny bits [15/20], and reinforcements attempt to retake the trench [21/100], but it's too late- the Trench is red. Bloody and Soviet.

After the Polish attack dies down, the Soviets decide not to advance any further due to high losses and the cold [1/10], despite the rest of the advance being open to attack.

**Center**

In this part of the Polish lines, reinforcements are scarce, and morale is falling quite quickly. It seemed like Polish troops would break and head back to Warsaw at any sight of a Soviet advance until a traveling circus and Gypsy dancers showed up, lifting the spirits of the troops [10/20].

But unlike the decadent west, the Soviets do not need entertainment to fight. Each soldier is given an extra potato, and the men are ready for battle and revolutionary singing [19/20].

The Soviets begin with a successful artillery attack [19/20] which disorients the Polish line and causes it to break at a few points. Soviet troops head forward, but something stops them from attacking at normal effectiveness- mud and ice. At some points the battlefield is slippery, in others it is sticky.

A few Soviet troops used to the winter manage to cross the line and begin taking the trenches [25/100], where they are helped by a Polish counter-artillery strike that hurts more Poles than it does Soviets [2/20].

The Reds almost have this trench too, so close! But the arrival of Polish backup results in the loss of the trench, and no side gains land [65/100].

**South**

In the South, Polish troops are well prepared [12/20] for the Soviet forces, who surround them, but not as prepared as the Soviets, who are eager to crush the stretched Polish lines [15/20].

Soviet artillery, now some of the best in the world because of how many times they've fired, strike Polish lines with great force [14/20], which'll help Soviet Infantry take the lines.

But just before the battle, an officer of the Soviet forces stole a doll from a local gypsy girl and laughed in her face. The girl ran home to her grandmother, and the old lady put a curse on the Soviet forces.

And the curse shows. Despite surrounding the Poles from three sides, the Soviets launch three attacks resulting in much more dead Soviets than it does Poles [25/100][14/100][1/100]. The officer with the stolen doll has his squad instantly gunned down by machine gun fire as they advance, and he is trapped under the bodies of his comrades.

Then the Poles advance! While the artillery is poor [8/20], the Soviet defense is even poorer. One attack broke completely, leaving a section undefended, and Polish troops advance there but not other areas [39/100].

After the battle, the cursed officer commits suicide, resulting in the curse ending.

Soviet Losses: 70k

Polish Losses: 48k

Way over in the Far East, the Japanese have resumed their advances for the first time in many months, and the troops are now excited [16/20]! Despite the number of reinforcements being low [2/20], they still have fresh men and supplies coming in, unlike the Soviets.

The artillery lights up and fires on Soviet forces [13/20] and the planes fly overhead, but don't really do anything to help the Japanese. After the battle, it is revealed that the pilots misread the orders 'scout and assist the attack' as 'just sight-see and don't help the battle'.

Then the Japanese charge, screaming at the top of their lungs to scare the Soviets. This move works, as the Soviets can't hold out against multiple deadly Japanese attacks [94/100][92/100][38/100].

Meanwhile, the Japanese Marines manage to land decently while under fire. While they can't take the province [73/100], they do secure the islands and inflict losses on the Soviets.

336,"After months of waiting for one side to make another move, the troops finally receive word that the politicians have failed (or succeeded, if war was their goal) in peace talks. The battle will resume.

The Japanese commanders happen to be very lucky, as their troops seem to not fear death today. Meanwhile the Soviet commanders try to boost their morale by having the troops [sing patriotic songs](http://wikieducator.org/images/b/b2/Russian_civil_war.jpg) like *Internationale*, which helps a bit.

Ahead of Soviet troops is a massive set of trenches, one that Japanese forces have created and even resided in the past few months. In the trenches sit soldiers of Japanese and Ukrainian command and thousands of rifles, pistols, ammunition crates, bombs, mortars, and even katanas.

The commanders figure that due to their massive size, sending a massive wave of men will do the trick, as it did back when the sailors rebelled. But they were wrong.

Thousands of Soviet soldiers rush forward onto the battlefield, screaming and firing shots as they run toward their enemy. But the efficiency of Japanese MGs and the decent firing of artillery results in disaster for the attackers. Bodies litter the field and the Soviet wave of lucky survivors fall back.

Not wanting their comrades to have died for nothing, Soviet commanders order a massive barrage of artillery fire on the enemy trenches. While the fire is accurate, it is not particularity damaging to the well dug-in defenders.

But another bit of bad luck curses the Soviets, this time in the form of their commanders' eyes and pride. They mistakenly believe that this artillery has hurt the Japanese, and they order another massive attack. But this one turns out to be much more successful, as a few battalions reach the trench lines and begin deadly hand-to-hand combats with their katana-armed opponents, but cannot hold out for very long and lose the trenches.

Mikhail Tukhachevsky, hearing of the failures of his subordinates, rushes to the front to rally the troops for himself. A man covered in military medals will surely get the troops motivated, right?

Wrong.

The appearance of their commander on the front only serves to demoralize a few troops, who see their commander all clean and unhurt while they are covered in grime, blood, and the brains of their headshotted comrades. Luckily Tukhachevsky recognizes the poor effect he has on the infantry and instead moves to lead the artillery to one last strike.

And strike they do. With their supreme commander's guiding hand, the Soviet artillery rains death down on the Japanese lines. The front trenches are filled with dirt and bodies. As the survivors call for backup and attempt to clear out their defenses, another wave comes.

Luckily for the Japanese, they manage to hold the trenches, but at great cost. Soviets fall once again due to the brave but desperate defense by the Japanese. The Soviets fall back and the Japanese begin to rebuild the trenches.

*""War breaks out with Poland and Russia again! Extra, extra, read all about it!""* Newspapers boys all across the world cry out as two giants of Eastern Europe are once again set to clash. 

The Soviet Union has prepared itself by moving more than a million men to its border in preparation for its offensive. Poland has responded by launching a massive propaganda blitz and recruiting thousands of lowly-trained men to fill the trenches.

As Soviet men began to march in, Polish planes swooped down overhead and noted Soviet weak points and strong points in their army, with only a handful of planes being shot down by Soviet machine guns.

The battle began with a very unexpected tactic- Soviet mass charge. Wow, who saw that coming? Apparently not the Poles, because the Soviets manage to inflict major damage on their forces  and reach the first line of trenches.

Disaster occurs when a second wave of Soviet troops moves in to help them secure the trench. Artillery bombards the second wave on accident, leaving the first alone to die with the Polish counterattack.

Trotsky orders another attack, and another, and another! It is estimated that one Soviet Soldier dies every second for nearly seven hours of spamming waves. And finally, with the fifth wave, the Polish cannot hold their first lines and they order a retreat.

The Soviets cheer, they have taken the first line! But what's this? It looks like a major dust cloud coming right towards them. Soviet Scouts peer ahead in their binoculars and see what appears to be hundreds of large animals charging towards them.

""Stampede! Stampede! Open fire!"" Soviet Commanders frantically cry out. But due to half of the troops being environmentalists and they other half being very tired or incompetent, not much fire is opened on the stampede of [Żubroń](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWWP/comments/4xr5ec/event_%C5%BCubro%C5%84_breeding_and_other_bison_business/). Some men are trampled while others run away.

Seeing how the Soviets retreat, the Poles now sloppily attempt a counterattack to advance into Soviet territory. But due to much of their force being comprised of green men, they advance but can't hold it, and only retreat back to the first line.

South of the main battle, the Soviets try another charge into what seems to be undefended Polish territory, capturing a few villages on their advance into Poland. But the Polish have another trick up their sleeve!  Out of the trees come hundreds of tanks and other heavily armored vehicles and they begin to blast the Soviets to bits. The Soviet commander knows he has no anti-armor weapons, and smartly orders a retreat back into the Soviet Union.

Results: Stalemate

* Polish territory lost, then retaken by Poland

* More Soviet casualties than Polish casualties

Soviet Losses: 67k

Polish losses: 22k

The Polish and Japanese forces continue in their fight against the Soviets! When looking back upon the summer of 1928, historians will note that it had mixed results for both sides.

Polish Front
---

**North**

In the North, the Poles were more ready for their offensive [14/20] than the Soviets were [10/20]. The red forces rushed into battle first quite nervously, and were punished for it.

Their artillery strikes were mediocre [9/20], and almost all of their waves ended in disaster [35/100][14/100][32/100]! But these thousands of men who died did do one thing right- tire the Poles.

As they attempted to counterattack, their artillery nearly ran out of shot [6/20] and their advances were weak [40/100]. Despite this, they did manage to liberate an Eastern province from Soviet control.


**Center**

This area has seen the harshest fighting of the war, as trees have been torn from the Earth and civilians and their former houses are to be found scattered in the mud. Both sides feel the effect of the dying land, and both have shit morale [4/20].

The Soviets lead one halfhearted attack, with the artillery barely finding its mark [8/20]. But as the troops are sludging through the mud on their advance, a group of tanks rushes by and Trotsky pops out of a hatch. This inspires the men to job to the front line, which they take [97/100].

The Polish counterattack is an extreme failure, not from the artillery, who manage to hold the Soviets back, but the advance squads, and they fall back even further [14/20][9/100].

**South**

In the South, both sides are also equally ready for battle, but this time not depressed about their surroundings [13/20].

Polish artillery opens fire as they make the first attack, and it clears the way for a well-coordinated attack [11/20][71/100].

The Soviets manage to blast the Poles back a bit [18/20], but the infantry spoils all gains made by their comrades after two poor attacks [29/100][2/100].

Far Eastern Front

No battle occurs. A small group of Japanese marines manage to blow up railroads, roads, communication equipment, and supply caravans without being spotted. Chaos spreads among Soviet lines, as they cannot receive reinforcements for the next phase because of this.

The troops eventually march to the point where they can see the city's walls, so they stop and wait for the planes to provide a scouting report.

*Voooom!*

The Ansaldos rush past overhead and head towards the city. The circle around a few times, and shots can be heard, presumably from the Senussi defenders.

One plane falls from the sky and crashes into the sandy streets below. The rest of the pilots, wanting to not die, decide to head back before the rest of them are shot down.

An incomplete reconnaissance report is submitted by the pilots, saying that a good amount of Senussi are inside the city, but their positions aren't really known [6/10].

The commander, a foolish man from the Great War, decides that the planes should be sent back into the air and conduct a proper report before attacking [1/10] . The pilots call him an unprepared coward, but they head back anyway.

The planes fly back again, and get the same result. Yet another plane is shot out of the sky and the pilots once again come back with a scrap of information- the Senussi have anywhere between 5,000 to 10,000 men and they seem to be mostly infantry.

The commander is pleased with this, so he orders an attack [8/10].

Despite such better arms, the Italians don't quite use it to their advantage. The artillery put more shots in the sand than in Senussi defenses, and the bombers do the same [7/20][6/20].

The tanks begin to move forward, with troops crowding behind them as to avoid incoming fire from the defenders. The cavalry charges in quickly from the sides.

The attack works! The attackers reach the walls and begin to enter the city [82/100], smashing down the weak defenses the Senussi have prepared.

And as soon as the walls were broken, so were the Senussi. The Italian attackers began to gun their positions down as they marched through the streets with the help of tanks and much more guns [85/100].

The city is retaken, and the Senussi run away on horseback or on foot, some dropping their rifles behind them.

Italian losses: 2 recon planes, one bomber, 400 men

---

Soviet forces, well rested and ready for the offensive, suit up and begin to rise up from their trenches [15/20]. They can hear the war songs sung by the determined Polish soldiers, despite the trenches being a great distance away [20/20].

The Soviets open with a weak barrage of artillery for their first wave [4/20] ^^ayyyyy who do much better than expected and manage to reach Polish trenches [92/100].

Another artillery strike comes in, killing both Poles and Soviets in the trenches [11/20]], followed by another wave of Soviets, who reinforce the trench-takers and eliminate the last of the Poles here [93/100]. The trenches have been taken!

As the line is starting to be secured, Polish armor rolls onto the battlefield, beginning a counterattack. The artillery strike from the Poles don't harm the Soviets [6/20], and the human and armor wave doesn't do much damage either [36/100].

The Poles fall back, accepting this loss of land, but not the war.

Soviet losses: 22k

Polish losses: 30k

In the south, where Stalin is in charge, Soviet forces have somehow *lost* land. Stalin ordered an attack on Polish positions and allowed his men to take large amounts of losses, then pulled them back and allowed for a Polish counterattack to take vast amounts of land.

Soviet losses: 4k

Polish losses: 400

After months of fighting in the East, both the Soviets [11/20] and the Japanese [9/20] are tired of war. But their prideful commanders order them back onto the battlefield so one side can kill more men than the other.

The Soviets fire a decent artillery strike on Japanese positions [10/20], but the infantry advance is a disaster [19/100]! Tukhachevsky orders the tanks to show the infantry how to advance, but loses two of them due to Japanese grenade spam [24/100]. One manages to poke a hole in Japanese positions, so he orders a massive attack in the area.

The line breaks [90/100]! Soviet troops pour into the trenches, where they are met with Japanese steel and artillery strikes [16/20]. Soviet reinforcements manage to barely save the troops in the trenches, and the Japanese finally pull back, likely due to a lack of ammunition.

With few losses so far and a good amount of recon, French forces move into Rif territory as the desert sun beats down on them. Scouts peer over rocks and sprint back to Rif camps, letting the enmy know of the French presence. But the French are prepared, and move to Ceuta to liberate this area from rebel rule.

When they arrive they are hit by a weak artillery barrage from Rif forces at the gates. It appears they're running out of proper ammo for the captured artillery. French forces open fire, and the Rrif forces retreat into the city walls, letting the French take the gates.

The commander, realizing this is a trap, decides not to advance or shell the city, but waits outside the walls and will let the rebels starve out. It is estimated they will only last a few months.

As the Baltic advance continues, the people of Lithuania are firmly against them. Old ladies spit at the soldiers and young children throw rocks at their horses. The men have all headed off to their nearest recruiting station.

Meanwhile, at the harbor, the Baltic boats begin to play music in an attempt to get Lithuanian support. This does not go well at all. Fishermen and dockworkers throw old fish on the boats and seagulls flock down and annoy the Batlic sailors. The people of the port begin to protest and shout pro-Lithuanian songs.

The Baltic Cavalry have received word of strong Lithuanian resistance gathering against them. Their commander decides that putting down this small band of rabble will show the country who is really in charge.

The Baltic Cavalry head out and charge towards the Lithuanian forces, firing and waving flags. But the Defenders manage to repel this attack while under a pro-Polish commander. The Baltic Cavalry attacks again, this time managing to force the Lithuanians backwards, but at very heavy losses. The Kurzemes group is forced to stay where they are and wait for reinforcements.

477,"*""War breaks out with Poland and Russia again! Extra, extra, read all about it!""* Newspapers boys all across the world cry out as two giants of Eastern Europe are once again set to clash. 

The Soviet Union has prepared itself by moving more than a million men to its border in preparation for its offensive. Poland has responded by launching a massive propaganda blitz and recruiting thousands of lowly-trained men to fill the trenches.

As Soviet men began to march in, Polish planes swooped down overhead and noted Soviet weak points and strong points in their army, with only a handful of planes being shot down by Soviet machine guns.

The battle began with a very unexpected tactic- Soviet mass charge. Wow, who saw that coming? Apparently not the Poles, because the Soviets manage to inflict major damage on their forces  and reach the first line of trenches.

Disaster occurs when a second wave of Soviet troops moves in to help them secure the trench. Artillery bombards the second wave on accident, leaving the first alone to die with the Polish counterattack.

Trotsky orders another attack, and another, and another! It is estimated that one Soviet Soldier dies every second for nearly seven hours of spamming waves. And finally, with the fifth wave, the Polish cannot hold their first lines and they order a retreat.

The Soviets cheer, they have taken the first line! But what's this? It looks like a major dust cloud coming right towards them. Soviet Scouts peer ahead in their binoculars and see what appears to be hundreds of large animals charging towards them.

""Stampede! Stampede! Open fire!"" Soviet Commanders frantically cry out. But due to half of the troops being environmentalists and they other half being very tired or incompetent, not much fire is opened on the stampede of [Żubroń](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWWP/comments/4xr5ec/event_%C5%BCubro%C5%84_breeding_and_other_bison_business/). Some men are trampled while others run away.

Seeing how the Soviets retreat, the Poles now sloppily attempt a counterattack to advance into Soviet territory. But due to much of their force being comprised of green men, they advance but can't hold it, and only retreat back to the first line.

South of the main battle, the Soviets try another charge into what seems to be undefended Polish territory, capturing a few villages on their advance into Poland. But the Polish have another trick up their sleeve!  Out of the trees come hundreds of tanks and other heavily armored vehicles and they begin to blast the Soviets to bits. The Soviet commander knows he has no anti-armor weapons, and smartly orders a retreat back into the Soviet Union.

Results: Stalemate

* Polish territory lost, then retaken by Poland

* More Soviet casualties than Polish casualties

Before the French can set out again, they set up camp a few miles inland of Rif territory to pick the sand out of their guns and their uniforms. But under the cover of the night sky, Rif forces slowly move in...

And for a while, they are unnoticed. But as they are a few hundred meters from the camp, they are spotted, and the French scramble to push back these ambushers.

The Japanese commanders happen to be very lucky, as their troops seem to not fear death today. Meanwhile the Soviet commanders try to boost their morale by having the troops [sing patriotic songs](http://wikieducator.org/images/b/b2/Russian_civil_war.jpg) like *Internationale*, which helps a bit.

Ahead of Soviet troops is a massive set of trenches, one that Japanese forces have created and even resided in the past few months. In the trenches sit soldiers of Japanese and Ukrainian command and thousands of rifles, pistols, ammunition crates, bombs, mortars, and even katanas.

The commanders figure that due to their massive size, sending a massive wave of men will do the trick, as it did back when the sailors rebelled. But they were wrong.

Thousands of Soviet soldiers rush forward onto the battlefield, screaming and firing shots as they run toward their enemy. But the efficiency of Japanese MGs and the decent firing of artillery results in disaster for the attackers. Bodies litter the field and the Soviet wave of lucky survivors fall back.

Not wanting their comrades to have died for nothing, Soviet commanders order a massive barrage of artillery fire on the enemy trenches. While the fire is accurate, it is not particularity damaging to the well dug-in defenders.

But another bit of bad luck curses the Soviets, this time in the form of their commanders' eyes and pride. They mistakenly believe that this artillery has hurt the Japanese, and they order another massive attack. But this one turns out to be much more successful, as a few battalions reach the trench lines and begin deadly hand-to-hand combats with their katana-armed opponents, but cannot hold out for very long and lose the trenches.

Mikhail Tukhachevsky, hearing of the failures of his subordinates, rushes to the front to rally the troops for himself. A man covered in military medals will surely get the troops motivated, right?

Wrong.

The appearance of their commander on the front only serves to demoralize a few troops, who see their commander all clean and unhurt while they are covered in grime, blood, and the brains of their headshotted comrades. Luckily Tukhachevsky recognizes the poor effect he has on the infantry and instead moves to lead the artillery to one last strike.

And strike they do. With their supreme commander's guiding hand, the Soviet artillery rains death down on the Japanese lines. The front trenches are filled with dirt and bodies. As the survivors call for backup and attempt to clear out their defenses, another wave comes.

Luckily for the Japanese, they manage to hold the trenches, but at great cost. Soviets fall once again due to the brave but desperate defense by the Japanese. The Soviets fall back and the Japanese begin to rebuild the trenches.

Luckily, they manage to maintain their form and not retreat all the way to Nanning. They hold at Chongqing, but very tired and bloody.

The Seventh Division has a much more mixed result. While they attack a much more dug-in opponent, they manage to charge through the defenses and shatter the opponent. While attempting to pursue, the army rides further into enemy territory, only to be pushed back by a reserves force. In their hasty retreat, they lose hundreds of men in the forests, including general Li Zongren!

In the East Caucasus, the Soviets meet a small Azerbaijani force [5/10] that manages to put itself in an easily-defendable spot atop a mountain pass. The Soviets will have to defeat them to cross into Azerbaijan. The Soviets have average morale [5/10] on this cold march into the mountains, and begin to skirmish with local forces as the sun rises one morning. 

It's a beautiful sight, that is, if you're cheering for Azerbaijan. As the sun illuminates the tops of mountains with its glorious glow, it shows the Soviet bodes scattered from two poor waves [33/100] [20/100]. As the commanding officer orders a retreat, the Azerbaijani forces foolishly counterattack, causing as many casualties to the enemy as they do to themselves [54/100], which'll make it easier for the Soviets in the next advance.

Soviet losses: 8k

In the Central Caucasus, the Soviets officers find their men in very high spirits [10/10] and begin marching to find the enemy in very high ground [4/10]. Advancing is going to be a challenge, but they do what they must.

And in two very different charges, the Soviets attack. The first charge results in men charging up a hill and either getting shot or slipping and falling down the hill to their death, or a combination of both after getting shot in the leg [6/100]. After a small lunch break for both sides, the Soviets try again, but this time, they march in backwards in hopes of confusing the defenders into thinking they are retreating. It works [97/100 and the Soviets storm up the hill and take it.

I am a noob at the specific rules you guys have, so I may have some trouble at the beginning but hope to be a positive benefit to the* **country***!""*

&gt; You wouldn't deny that young man his dreams would you? If you would, you heartless Slavs, come take our family yourself.

The Yugoslavs start to advance up the hill, but the IMRO manage to cling to the rocks and fire, making themselves hard to hit against the exposed Yugoslav forces. Many casualties are taken by the attackers.

The Yugoslav forces attempt to advance again, but do even poorer at attacking. Once again, they retreat taking heavy losses.

Tired of seeing his men, fail again and again, Milan Nedic attempts to give a speech mid battle. Unfortunately, he is drowned out by the screams of his dying men.

Seeing that his words fall on few ears, Nedic decides to lead the charge by himself at the IMRO. He runs up the hill, unharmed by enemy fire. His troops follow and succeed in making progress up the hill.

But now the IMRO, realizing it's now or never, attempt their own charge at the surprised Yugoslav forces. They fix bayonets, raise swords, scream like madmen, then sprint down the hill to scare the Yugoslavs into losing their newly made advances.

And it works! The Yugoslavs retreat down the hill, losing all progress they had made earlier. The IMRO cheer from atop the hill, but they too have taken losses from this charge.

The Yugoslavs retreat a few miles away, and try to continue a propaganda campaign with what appears to be a beaten army. The IMRO must now also replenish their losses as well.

Yugoslav losses: 8k

IMRO losses: 3k

A bit of ways away, the Albanians attack another IMRO group that has risen in their own land. Unlike the Yugoslav battle, the Albanians engage a green army on equal terrain.

The Albanians start the battle with a fierce attack to both flanks, trying to force the smaller IMRO force to the center so they can be surrounded. And it works!

The Albanians slowly move to surround the IMRO, who recognize that they may be closed in soon. They attempt to break out of this encirclement, but cannot stop it, only slow it down. The Albanians try to attempt a final blow to the IMRO, and charge in with all forces.

And in a masterful display of Albanian ferocity, they manage to surround and slaughter the IMRO until a white flag raises. The Albanians have won the day with few losses!

Albanian losses: 500

Strikes form in major cities, and factories that produced supplies for the soldiers are shut down. Farmers spend the day protesting, not working the fields. And now the Transylvanians, who believe the conscription is biased against them, demand special rights.

1 ""Wha' dey be doin' nao? Dem's gunna tuk our jerbs!"" Thousands of uneducated farmers misunderstand the reforms, believing that the farmland is going to be given to Italian immigrants and they will take their jobs. Unrest grows in the Balkans. The reform is a complete failure.

2-3 ""You know what Yugoslavia needs? Straight Lines!"" announces the minister in charge of implementing the reform. The country's agriculture is divided into even squares, making the food output very unproductive due to some squares being on rocky mountainsides while others are in fertile grasslands. The reform is unproductive, and support for the monarchy lowers.

4-6 The country's agriculture is completely reformed, and the land is redistributed. Due to Yugoslavia having a new and untrained government, corruption is rampart, and more farms are handed out to the minister's family and friends. The reform is successful, and support for the communist party increases.

7-9 ""Down with the Magyars!"" Chant the farmers, welcoming the farm reforms. They cheer as inspectors enter the countryside, mark up how land is divided, and hurl insults at the now-poor Hungarian landlords from their increased land amount. The reform is successful, but support for the communist party remains the same.

10 The government, eager to finally have a task with their new kingdom's land, invite local farmer heads and members of all the parties to decide how the land will be divided.

Wow, that's a river.

If we have mods for battles, every mod needs to be a battle mod at the beginning. Because there as so many battles being fought at one time, I don't see any other way for it than having every mod commit.

I think players should be able to change their nations realistically over the course of a few posts. For example, Germany going from Wiemar to Nazis in power should have a few posts about the terrible economy, the rise of the Nazis, chaos in elections, and finally a seizure of power. Player's shouldn't be able to have amateur artist A. Hitler and his ragtag group of Brownshirts suddenly control the government in 1919.

Armies at the start should try to be as historical as possible, as well as costs for them as well. Every nation should start with whatever we can find on them. And armies that are fighting far away from their home country, like Interventionist forces in Russia or Anatolia should cost the government a lot of money and public support, as they did historically.",2016-04-30 21:40:58+00:00,d2nqxv7,1.0,t3_4h67db,2078.0,SWWP

1516,"The detachment sets out under a thick night sky, dark from constant cannon smoke and a minimal moon. Because of this, they manage to get close to the walls and are not seen by the guards, but their information may be innacurate.

They leave and return to the camp, which awake early in the morning as prayer begins. The men will need their strength, for the enemy is going to face them in battle today.

The camps are abandoned and cast aside. Some men will return to pick it up, others will not. But that does not matter for now, as the army is lining up and marching near the walls once again.

The defenders, knowing that they cannot repair the walls quickly enough to survive this barrage, also begin to line up on the walls ready to charge.

And as soon as the sun rises, both sides raise their weapons and ready for battle. The Ottomans stay put, hoping their ditches will stop the enemy. And the defenders pour forward, hoping their numbers can defeat the enemy.

The cannons stop their fire of the walls and begin to adjust to hit the now-moving army. All that is heard is the hoover eats of horses, the screams of men, and the drums of war. The sides get closer, and closer...

*pif* 

The first shot is fired off. Thousands follow it as both sides see men falling to the ground who were on the front line. Cannonfire now rains on both forces, who begin to fight in brutal melee combat.

But the Turks, who had scouted the castle the night before, know of the enemy's strong and weak points. They had seen that the southern gate was busted, so the enemy must be weaker from that side!

More Ottoman forces are moved to the weaker southern side to pressure the Austrians into making a mistake. Their move pays off, for when their opponent moves more men to the south, they have stretched their own lines too thin. The Turks press on with this advantage and begin to force their enemies backward.

Eventually the Austrians break into full retreat, heading back to the safety of their walls. The Ottomans chase the slow ones down, slashing at their feet as they try to run away. The cannons readjust their fire once again and begin to re-bombard the walls to allow for the infantry to enter the city.

It works. The walls crumble and the Ottomans are in. After a brief street skirmish, they force their way inside, looting and stealing what remains of Pressburg. 

The Ottomans are victorious. Losses are medium, with 2,400 regulars and 700 Janissaries falling, but the city is now in Turkish hands. Vienna will be next. ",2016-04-30 07:49:09+00:00,d2n4o7g,3.0,t1_d2ike9u,292290.0,empirepowers

A few of the men manage to make it ashore, but the waters slow down each soldier as they run to shore. It is not going well on the shores.

On the ships with cannons, the Knights open fire on the city's defenses. Old walls come crumbling down with each shot, and each time, an enemy's scream is heard. But it is not enough, for every enemy that falls, another seems to appear from these endless sand-colored horde of buildings.

Seeing that the Knights are already ashore and that cannonfire has not done anything for them already, the commander makes the decision to retreat and leave the last Knights behind. The canons are secured down and the oars lowered into the waters as the last of the fleet sails away.

It is a cold and wet day, but these are not unknown to Estonia. Neither is war, for this land has been fought over by various pagan tribes, Norsemen, and Crusaders. But today these lands will hold a battle between Swedish and Polish forces.

Jan Karol marches in the front of his forces as they cross into Swedish Estonia with mud on their boots and eyes watching the dark trees. He chooses to march alongside the river [Valgejõgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgej%C3%B5gi) and the men follow his orders, moving defensively. They do not want their supply lines to be cut in this dense woodland, where a lost army is soon a dead one.

After a day of marching, the army stops and sets up camp. A few Swedish Scouts are spotted and taken care of, others are not. But they are being watched and they know it. 

*September 16th*

The army spends a sleepless night near the banks of the river before marching north in the morning, where they reach the coast. Now the army stops their march through the eerily quiet countryside and a few detachments from the army head east to ""deal with"" some villages to the east.

Two thousand men in total split off. And for some, it will be the last time they see the commanders of the Polish army, for they are marching toward the village of [Iisaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iisaku), where the Swedes wait. As soon as the detachment comes upon the village, they are attacked by the Swedish army and instantly killed by the sheer number of defenders in the village. Hearing resistance, a few detachments head over to assist, but see that the entire Swedish army awaits. They retreat and head back to the river, where they report that a few detachments have been attacked by the Swedes in the east.

Now Jan Karol commands a few riders equipped with torches to inspect these dark forests and make sure that this is truly the Swedish army and not a diversion. When less light comes back than was sent into the forest, Jan knows that the Swedes have at least a significant force waiting in the east. He cancels his previous plans of marching west and the army leaves the river, heading to meet the Swedish army.

The Swedish army waits for them in the forests, guns and swords pointed at the south and the west, where they expect the Poles to come from. The wait in silence, which is soon disturbed by the faint sound of marching boots and hooves. They have orders to stay atop the hill, which they promise to follow to please their commanders.

But the Poles have similar orders: act defensively. They march at a snail's pace, and for the longest time, the armies can see a glimpse of each other across the forest but neither opens fire yet, for nether are in range. The Swedish artillery finally breaks this unofficial truce by firing into the trees where the Polish march. While this only hits the branches and trunks of trees, it gives the men lots of splinters from the exploding wood.

The Poles must now think quick on their feet. They cannot get the Swedes to charge, so the men try to hack down trees to build up defenses. When they find their plan has been splintered away, they decide to dig into the ground in small trenches to they can reorganize and regroup. As they sit in these shallow seeming-graves, Jan Karol must come up with a plan, and quickly. He decides to stick with the original plan of harassing the Swedes with Hussars and the other cavalry.

It was a great plan, but the Swedes were greatly prepared. Caltrops, strewn across the forest floor, prove to be a real difficulty for the Poles, who fall back after this pathetic attempt. Now the Poles have one last chance to attack, and they take that opportunity as the guns reload.

The men march forward through the forest, into firing range of the Swedish. The air quickly fills with smoke form the guns and hundreds of men fall to their feet. Surprisingly, the Poles are more successful in this volley, due to the Swede's decision to stay camped out in a damp forest for several hours. Unfortunately for the Poles, they simply do not have the men to keep up this attack. Jan Karol orders a retreat back to the river. The Swedes cheer as they leave.

---

In the end, this is a small victory for the Swedish forces. Because both sides acted defensively, neither committed fully to an attack and losses were minimal. It has shown the Polish forces are not ready to invade Estonia. At least not with such a small force.

Polish losses: 1,200 Infantry, 600 Cavalry

Swedish losses: 500 Infantry, 100 Cavalry

The general of the Wilds, not a foolish man, realizes that this equal volley of arrows hurts his own men more than Nurhaci's. He calls for a retreat to force his opponent to cross the river to attack him.

And as his troops pull back, he turns and sees that his plan has worked- Nurhaci has started to cross the river. He leads his troops up some high ground then they turn, and begin a charge.

Meanwhile, the Jianzhous are having great difficulty in crossing the river. The harsh, icey water scares the horses and annoys the men who struggle to get across this two hundred foot wide beast.

And just as half of the army manages to ford it and wait on the banks for the rest to cross, they are hit with showers of arrows. The Wilds are charging toward the wet and freezing force at full speed.

Nurhaci is now feeling an emotion he rarely feels- fear. His army is split by a river and the enemies are already charging. Deciding to take command, he attempts to unfreeze this army and start a charge.

Now both armies charge at each other, but Nurhaci's force is much slower and it certainly shows when they collide. The Wilds cut down the Jianzhous with great force as their speed has helped them. Nurhaci, realizing that this section of the army is lost, falls back with a few of his men to the banks of the river, where the rest of the army waits. They had been preparing to charge, but Nurhaci stops them and they cross the river once again, now heading back home.

Now the battle has truly begun, as both sides have started to move in their full forces at each other. The Western army slowly advances to assist their allies due to the great forces sent forward by the Easterners.

The Western forces continue to press forward on the right flank as the Eastern army slowly begins to fall back from this position, tired of battle. The Western forces manage to show restraint and not charge forward, which helps their lines in not being overstretched.

On the flank, the East loses [[1d3000 +1200]] While the West loses [[1d2600 + 1000]].

In the center, the Western forces are just starting to arrive to assist here against the larger number of Easterners.

1 All seems to go well, until a strange chanting is heard. It freaks out the Spaniards, who ready their weapons and aim them into the dark jungle. The chanting grows louder now, and the leaves seem to shake with each shout. 

Major Pedro is nervous now as he tightly grips his sword. Suddenly, the man next to him is stuck with a small spear! The man grabs at his neck to remove the weapon but another spear flies into his arm, and he falls over.

The men begin to fire into the trees, but more and more spears are sent toward the Spaniards. Tribals charge from the depths of the jungle, into the clearing, ripping Pedro's men apart. Pedro himself is last seen trying to hold off five half-naked screaming men.

No survivors are found.

2-4 Datu Sal begins ordering the tribal men to construct the city, but is soon becomes clear he is somewhat of a tyrant. He angrily lashes the children with vines when they refuse to work. He gives the workers not enough food to work. And it is clear that these workers are planning something.

Later in the day, a scream and a *thump* are heard, and Datu Sal is found on the ground, having fallen a great height from a tower. A tribal man stands on top, clutching a bloody hammer. The rest of the workers now turn to stare at the Spaniards, giving them the feeling that they are unwelcome here. Not wanting to risk his men, Major Pedro orders his men to quickly and quietly leave the area.

5-8 The swampy area where the work begins is known for its great number of beasts. Snakes, monkeys, crocodiles, and great cats have been spotted in the area. The workers try to build the city, but constant attacks slow them down.

Datu Sal asks for Major Pedro to deploy his men in the jungle so that construction may continue. It will be dangerous, but it will let the city be built.

9 The city has a decent start, with the builders successfully hauling supplies from their former village and starting to lay down the foundation. The work continues like this, but even after the builders showing great skill, the fort sinks into the swamp because of poor ground. You may start again on this slightly more stable ground than before, or try to scout out new land in the jungle...

16-30 - The peasants do nothing, and the cavalry fail to destroy the bridges. After a day of searching, the fleet manages to find the Count swimming around in the marshes with the rest of his army, killing 500 + [[1d500]] of them and only losing -1 + [[1d2]] from the returning fire.

31-65 - The peasants are initially unhelpful, but warm up to the Batavians. They point out where the Count has fled. The cavalry succeed in cutting them off, and the army is surrounded.

66-80 - The peasants quickly tell where the Count has fled. The cavalry manage to cut off his escape routes, and he is fully surrounded with 500 + [[1d1000]] men scattering and running back their homes.

81-99 The count is immediately spotted by the cavalry as soon as they are sent out and a small skirmish begins, killing [[1d500]] of the Count's men and [[1d500]] of the cavalry. The Batavians manage to fully surround the Count and he surrenders.

100 - The Count breaks out in full sprint, but trips and falls into the mud. His troops immediately desert him after seeing what a pathetic failure he is, and run away. He is then found by the Batavian army squirming about in the mud.

That part on Ataturk was really off. I know a lot of Kurds consider him a fascist and dislike him and his image, but the misinformation helps nobody. He did not call for a Pan-Turkic state such as the rest of the Young Turks such as Enver Pasha. He was actually in Gallipolli at the time of the genocides. Also, the part about Hitler being inspired by Ataturk was showing that Turkey as Nazi were best buddies. That picture was actually taken in 1941, the signing of the Nazi-Turkish non-aggression pact, which was after Atatturk's death and years after his time in power. 

Also I feel did not explain why the PKK was formed. It cut from Dersim, an event 30+ years before, to ""PKK is formed"", not expalaining Turkish politics of the time or why the PKK choose to rebel against the state.

Then it talks about HDP as some god-like party ""calling for peace"". This is not true for quite a few HDP members, who refuse to denounce the PKK for acts of terror (who I'm sure have been banned from their party). Also, it fails to mention that a considerable amount of conservative Kurds support AKP.

The Granadan force will retreat slightly into the woods for more cover. All remaining cavalry, light and heavy, will stay on the eastern side of the unit to hold off any cavalry charges from the incoming Castillian cavalry.

Once in the woods, they will move up to higher ground. The infantry will saty in defensive positions, and will rarely charge. The cavalry will not charge at all, as the rocky ground will be difficult on the horses. Overall, they should be north of where they started (in the phase, not in the battle), and north-west of the city.

3143,"**Claim: Mamluks**

*History:*
The Mamluks, originally slaves of Qipchaq Turkic origin, were imported into the Ayyubid Empire to be trained into houseboys, servants, and warriors. They were converted to Islam and eventually freed but expected to be loyal to their masters. They were given great power in the military, which they took advantage of by seizing power after the death of the sultan, killing his heir. They created the Bahri dynasty, setting themselves on the throne.

The Mamluks defeated the crusader states and fought back against the 7th crusade and its leaders attempting to reconquer the land. However, the leader of the Mamluks died before the battle, leading to future instability. Factions fought over control of Egypt and Syria, and the Mongols starting their invasion from the north. The two factions set aside difference to defeat the Mongols, becoming the first force to defeat a major Mongol army. The general who led the battle went to become sultan after the battle, eliminating all the other factions.

The Mamluks went on to capture Antioch, Nubia, and reclaim land taken by the Mongols. The caliph was restored in Cairo. The Bahri dynasty, was soon to end, however, as Circassians become dominant in the government. A successful revolt caused a change in dynasty, bringing the Burji dynasty to power in the late 14th century.

The Burji dynasty was unable to resist the armies of Timur. In the eary 15th century, the power was restored briefly with the capture of Cyprus, but repelled at Rhodes. In 1470, power is held by Qaitbay, or Al-Ashraf Sayf ad-Din Qa'it Bay.

*Ruler:* Al-Ashraf Sayf ad-Din Qa'it Bay. Despite his reluctance to take the throne, he was a just and strong ruler, known for his military conquests and just acts, deciding to not exile the former deposed sultan.

*Foreign relations:* Converted the Golden Horde to Islam. Caliph of all Sunni Islamic states. Hostile with Ottomans, having fought a war recently.


*Traditions:* The Mamluks were traditional slave boys, relying on a system known as *ustad*. The loyalty to the master is known as *khushdashiya*. *Furūsiyya* is the system of warrior's exercise, similar to Knights of Christianity.

-----

Qaitbay stumbled off of his horse. His undergarments were stained with blood and sweat, his armor chipped and bent. The battle with the Syrians had been a harsh one, with major causalities taken from both sides. Despite his old frame, the sultan fought and led like a young man, full of energy and at the face of the enemy.

Qaitbay wandered into the palace, his eyes still hurting from the hot sun beating down on his men as they returned to Cairo. One of the servant boys, a young man named Suq Madiq, rushed up to him to attend to him. Qaitbay sat down and slumped into his throne while Suq Madiq and the team of servants began to remove his armor.

The servants dropped his helmet, creating a loud crash and a dent on the tile. One servant tripped over Qaitbay's sword, slicing his leg open and then started to wail. Qaitbay grabbed one by the neck furious, barely opening one eye, he began to yell at the poor frightened man. 

Suq Madiq, sensing the sultan's anger, dismissed the servant team before they could cause any more trouble. He locked the door behind them, and swept aside the armor, placing it carefully on the shelves. He then pulled out a bowl of hot oil, and sat down beside Qaitbay.

""Shh, my leader, close your eyes and rest I will help you in relaxing.""

Suq Madiq dipped his hands in the bowl, then began to spread the liquid all over Qaitbay's chest. the king began to feel relaxed as the smooth hands felt his chest and unwrapped his garments. He moaned with pleasure.",2015-11-25 08:52:31+00:00,cxcf2pt,1.0,t3_3tri34,285152.0,empirepowers

3158,"**Scotland**

*History:* Scotland was once known as Caledonia, Pictland, and Alba. Its rules has changed from Picts, Norsemen, Irishmen, and Scots. The kingdom has seen only a few great kings, with regents playing a large part in the ruling of the land, leading the country to be weak and divided until the 14th and 15th centuries. Wars are common with the English, but the Scots have managed to push them back eventually.

*Ruler:* James III (Stuart Dynasty), recently took power from regents. Seen as weak and effeminate, enjoys learning rather than fighting.

*Administration:* Monarchy and Parliament present in central and southern Scotland, system of clans and tribes present in certain parts of the north and the Isles. Scottish law reformed by James I in 1430s. Crown frequently at odd with clans and the Papacy.

*Traditions:* Scottish-English rivalry, all Scots hate their old enemy. Clan system deeply rooted in, with powerful families threatening the crown. Clans spread throughout country, but mainly in the [northern lands and Western Isles](http://www.scotsfamily.com/clan_map.jpg). [Multiple languages present in Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic#/media/File:Gaelic1400nich.png), showing an even greater divide of the north and south. Combination of Norman culture from the kings and elite, Celtic from the tribes, and Norse from the Vikings. Traditional guerilla infantry common in wars with England.

*The Arts:* The influence of England is great on the Scottish Crown, and Norman ways have been seen in the monarchs. Love for learning and art has spawned universities, schools, and observatories, mainly built for the elite. The Norman presence is not as great in the North, but spoken word tales of Scottish heroes, William Wallace being one example, have survived throughout history.

*Foreign relations:* Auld Alliance with France to fight off a common enemy, Enemy of England, Royal marriage with Denmark in exchange for North Sea Islands.

*Empirepowers:* The goal of the game is not to “win”. The goal isn’t to dominate your opponents, (Players have been seen to not like this and leave the game as a result) but to play as that country would act. For example, Scotland will not be invading Africa in the name of Imperialism in 1500. Rather Scotland will fight with the English, civilize the north, and expand the arts.

I have participated in Empirepowers as well as a few other “-powers” games.

*RP*

The year is 1498.

An English banner appeared on the horizon. A small messenger party flew it as the raced toward the border. Their message was clear and simple: The kingdoms of Scotland and England were now at war. The message was taken from the trembling hands of the watchman and into the hands of a horseman, who raced to the throne to deliver the message.

-----

“Bastards!” Roared King James, throwing the chessboard across the room. His opponent, the Bishop McMillan, was mildly annoyed. He had finally been close to beating the game, *but noo. The English had to declare war again.* He sighed, then began picking up the pieces as the king continued his rant. 

“The devil has seen our weakness and declared war right at the same moment! I’m starting to think he organized the clan revolt in Moray, knowing our army would be there at the time! Scotland is doomed!” The king stopped to catch his breath, but before he could yell again, the bishop interrupted him.

“Sir, there’s one option you have forgotten. Scotland isn’t doomed just yet”

“Oh yes? And what is that option?” the king said through his teeth, angry at the man who had almost beat him at chess before he cleverly decided to flip the table as the note of war was read to him.

“Are you forgetting the tales of the old? The resistance? William Wallace? We don’t have to have the army fight, just get a few of those crazy Gaelic clansman to fight them in the marches while our army arrives.”

The king paused to consider his options. He could march the clansmen and their families to death and be a bit more hated than he was right now, potentially leading to another attack by the families, or he could let the dirty English swine trample his precious lowlands. The choice was simple, really.

“Raise the militias!”

Event: Scottish clans are requested to cease their hostilities with eachother and the crown and join the war against England. The army is reordered to march southward to meet the English at the neck.",2015-11-22 18:03:09+00:00,cx965up,1.0,t3_3tri34,58990.0,empirepowers

Your attempts at extorting a nation for the actions of its drunkards is a ludicrous way of raising the funds to pay off your lavish wedding. To attempt such a low form of diplomacy is as low as piracy itself. I will not pay off the queen, who is probably not in the best emotional time-frame right now, being newly married.

Compose yourself come May 12, be ready to negotiate a proper way instead of offering war as the second option, and maybe we will even start to think about considering your offer. A true leader does not let their emotions get the best of themselves. I'm sure it will go over *really great* with your people if you start a costly war less than a year after arising to the throne.

3517,"The pirates, one by one, begin bursting out of their hiding spots. They charge out of the wagons and onto the bloodstained streets where their comrades and opponents lay gasping their last breathes of air. The skirmish continues as steel clashes and shots ring out.

Piri sees that even though his men can hold the guards at the current size, they have failed to stop the reinforcements from spilling out of the castle. He bolts away from the battle, (with the men from the one of the wagons whose door was stuck for most of the fight and only managed to open it once they saw their commander retreat) plucking an expensive looking bottle of alcohol  and a fine looking-scarf from the gifts.

The men reach a corner and round it, headed for the port. Piri stops to look behind at the pirates in their last stand against the guards. They are backed up against the wagon, madly swinging their swords while attempting to dodge arrows and bullets. One of them is even desperately chucking gifts for the queen at the guards in hopes that it will somehow stop his inevitable fall.
Piri turns back to his men that have run with him away from the battle. They begin running to the harbor, the sounds of battle getting softer.

 As their sprint down the streets continues, Piri finds himself slowing, his side in pain. He grips his abdomen and notices blood on his hand. His men continue to run, but Piri decides to stray away from the runners. Dizzy, he limps off to the side.

The runners continue their sprint. They are so close, almost at the harbor. They are going to escape! They are a ecstatic, they will return home! But they have celebrated too early. Running into the harbor has led them straight into a large group of guards. Which one of them was supposed to warn them of this?

""Piri"" they mutter as they drop their swords and raise their hands.

---
Piri is bleeding, badly. Wrapping the scarf around the wound, he heads to the water to wash it. He first cups his hands and pours the water on the gash. He decides this isn't enough and begins to wade in the water. *This is nice, I could see myself dying here* he thinks. He closes his eyes and lets himself drift. He is slowly falling asleep. Just a few more seconds and he'll sleep and dream forever, wouldn't that be nice? 

His dream of death is cut short when he is pulled from the water. Piri coughs out the water from his lungs. He opens his eyes to see Jaq drinking his expensive alcohol.

All of a sudden, the wagon's door is thrown shut by the Turk. He whistles and slaps the window of the wagon three times, very loudly. The guards rush to the door, but Piri has thrown his body weight against the door. The boxes tear themselves open and the barrels shoot off their tops as angry scimitar-wielding pirates burst out.

Hearing yells and the clashing of swords, Piri does the same signal to each wagon in his caravan. With the side guards distracted, the pirates can now enter the castle.

3654,"&gt; In reality the PKK has been integrating itself into political life in Kurdistan for 30 years and it's only gotten better at it as time goes on

I actually think this is going to be worse in the long run for them. When PKK goes into government as Kurdish parties like HDP, people think ""Oh, these guys are former terrorists in our government. We can't allow that!"" and they are rejected again from the political process. PKK needs to stay away completely, let Kurdish political parties form from their own ways, not connected to the PKK, to allow for more Kurdish representation and rule in the government.",2015-08-24 05:31:48+00:00,cudmgii,8.0,t1_cudm2cz,1071.0,worldnews

3656,"The average secular Turk doesn't like Erdogan. Whenever politics are brought up, a Turk will say ""don't talk to me about politics, it's hopeless what Erdogan has done to this country!"" or it will involve a long loud talking/mild yelling match. Despite this, they don't rebel up against Erdogan.

Some of the extremes may join or sympathize with the radical left terrorist groups, PKK being one of them, but you don't see that occurring very often.

Sure, Kurds may feel more attracted to the PKK rather than AKP or the military, and some even more now that the war has started up again and western media are sympathetic towards the PKK. But the majority of Kurds aren't going to actively rebel just because the mayors did. The average Kurd isn't going to risk their life fighting a much stronger enemy. They may feel some sympathy towards the PKK, but they still aren't that point where a majority of Kurds are asking for a state.",2015-08-24 05:04:33+00:00,cudlupr,6.0,t1_cudllaw,663.0,worldnews
