These updates will be posted as we make major steps towards season six.

First off, happy birthday /r/empirepowers! You're now two years old and one of the largest x-powers communities out there.

Now onto what the next season is going to be like:

* *New Chat.* We're switching over from the Kiwi IRC channel to a [Discord channel.](https://discord.gg/jMN2gKu) The discord channel allows for voice chat, multiple channels, and more ranks. You can find it **[here](https://discord.gg/jMN2gKu)**.

* *1500 Start Date.* You may have noticed that the moderation team has now changed quite a bit since the last updates and we've got a new team working on the next season. We're not the medieval team anymore, so we're doing 1500.

* *New Mechanics and Spreadsheets.*  We're also working on a new spreadsheet, this time one that won't break, as well as several other mechanics such as a better trade system, war system, and life/death of character system. We're running a closed test season to work on all of these mechanics and if you're interested in joining the testing season, [send us mail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fempirepowers) or ask us in the [discord](https://discord.gg/jMN2gKu).

* *New Map.* Once again, we've got /u/amodii hard at work making a new map for next season. This map is going to be much larger than the previous maps with more provinces, but it's going to focus on Europe and areas of European colonization and influence.

**Illion**

Settled on both banks and an island of the Great River, this settlement is the largest and most prominent of the Illionians. The island, known as *Tenedos*, is guarded by two sets of walls and houses, among other important sites, the Hall of the  Chieftain and the treasury.

The rest of the city, with its neatly cobbled streets and well-built houses, takes up its position on the banks. A wall surrounds this area with multiple gate entrances to allow traders in from the surrounding countryside.

A few small docks allow for rafts to float up and down the Great River for trade, making this settlement rich and powerful.

**Kersontus**

This smaller settlement sits along the swampy delta of the Great River. It is notable for its fish  and mineral markets, as it has easy access to the water and the hills. Though small, it is a well known trade site.

**Azox**

This small border settlement exists to mark the first site of Illionian rule. When the Trojan refugees made land, they first settled here then spread west, finding the east too full of Scythians to settle. The city still exists for the purposes of guarding the eastern flank.

**Kerkantis**

This settlement is the smallest in Illion. Despite being along the Euxine Sea, it is less favored by fishermen and merchants. Unlike the other cities of Tauris, this one is settled by Illionians, not Greeks.

**Cherson**

The second largest settlement in Illion is a site of trade with the people of the south Euxine Sea. Like Illion, it is rich by trade and well defended by walls, but is not as powerful.

**Neopolis**

This Greek settled city is now mainly inhabited by Illionians. It once existed as a walled city to guard the more important settlements of the south, but now is important for inland traders such as farmers and hunters to bring their products.

A few Scythians also live within the walls, renowned for their archery skills by the local hunters.

**Theodosia**

Another Greek city, this settlement also serves as a trade site with the rest of the Euxine Sea. Although smaller than Kerkantis, it is much denser inside of well built city walls. 

This city also contains the highest amount of Greeks, who look down on the rest of Illion as uncultured half-barbarians.

**The Land**

The countryside of Illion varies from being forested to steppes to hills to farmland. These temperate biomes allow for a large amount of food to be gathered and brought to the city.

Most of the countryside is farmland, covered in wheat, fruit trees, cabbages, hops, and other foods. The farmers take in each harvest to the cities so that it may be eaten by the people or sent off to faraway lands.

The countryside is also the location of many fire festivals, a summer event of the Illionians. Greeks, Cimmerians, Tauri, and Scythians usually refuse to participate, leaving the Illionians to their own festivities.

Her name was Raiya, princess of the Tauri. She had been running for two days now, trying to escape the Illionians as they continued their conquest of the Tauri lands. Initially she had been running with her servants and her sisters, but they had fallen behind, left to die in the forests or be slave to the Illionians.

She continued to run at full speed, letting branches tear at her dress and cut up her face as she got deeper and deeper into the dark woods. Leaves stuck to her hair and thorns stabbed in her feet, but she kept running, running, running, until she hit a root and tripped, landing face first into the mud.

Temporarily stunned, she listened to the sounds of the forest to see how far away the Illionians were. She heard the birds sing, a creek flow, and the leaves rustle, but no Illionians. She was safe for now, and could use this time to rest up. 

Raiya managed to raise herself with weak, shaking arms and trudged over to the creek. She began to wash off the dried blood from her face and the mud from her legs. But while splashing around in the water, she couldn't hear the sound of crackling wood- until the smoke filled the air around her.

The Illionians were burning up the forest to drive her out! Raiya stumbled out of the creek, desperately trying to look for a way out. The trees begin to catch fire around as she ran away, but smoke filled her lungs as she tried to stand. She stumbled to the ground, trying to crawl away, but it was too late! The fire was all around her, she was going to die here.

She collapsed on the ground and began to weep, accepting her death. Raiya was ready to be burnt to a crisp when a hand roughly grabbed her shoulder and pulled her through the mud and out of the forest, denying her of death. She looked up at her savior, expecting it to be one of her sisters or perhaps even her loyal servants.

But it was not.

It was an Illionian warrior. 

""I got one!"" He shouted to the others as he continued to drag the crying girl through the dirt away from the forest. Raiya was too weak to break free from his grasp, so she could only watch as she was tied up and thrown over the shoulder of another warrior like freshly hunted game.

She looked on in horror as other Tauri were being captured and taken by the Illionians. She cried again, not because of the smoke, but because her people had been defeated.",HistoricalWorldPowers,The Last of the Tauri,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/5bktzz/the_last_of_the_tauri/

It seemed that something was making them unafraid to trespass on Illion hunting and farming grounds.

Several meetings of farmers and hunters, the main workers on the borders, had confirmed that the Illionian people wanted something done by the chieftains. They wanted their land safe, they wanted action!

After a few delegates were chosen from among the people, they journeyed to Illion, the closest city and site of a chieftain, this time not for the barter market as they normally would, but to the halls of rulers to have their case heard.

---

""Send them in."" The chieftain ordered, allowing the slaves to guide in the group of farmers and hunters. They had come to the city filled with confidence, but after seeing the large, bearded with a scar across his face from the Tauri Wars and a great spear by his throne, their confidence faded quickly.

The chieftain stared down at the men before him, knowing that they were intimidated by his presence. He was glad that he could cause fear in another man, but this time it annoyed him.

""What're yah waitin' fer? Speak, men, speak!""

A few began to stammer out their problems, bt only one of them could speak loud enough for the chieftain to hear.

""Scythians, s-sire. They've been ruinin' our hunt and farm, runnin' us intah ruin. We need help ou' here.""

The chieftain scratched his beard, considering the request. These men were not rich, had no political power or status, and could be dead by tomorrow and it wouldn't hurt any Illionians besides their families. Still, he was never one to turn down a fight.

""Very well, I'll head tah yer lands with a group a' warriors. We can take care a' these *Scythians*."" The chieftain said, giving a look of disgust at the mention of the nomads.

The workers cheered, thanked the chieftain, then headed back to their homes on the border, flanked by a group of warriors.

---

""They's there, sire, galloping across the hills!"" The scout cried out, pointing to a few horsemen armed with bows. The Scythians were headed towards the Illionian hunting ground, ready to poach game that wasn't theirs.

""Aftah them then, we go!"" The chieftan roared as his men surged forward. The Scythians saw them coming and stopped. A few panicked and ran away, but most held their ground and fired their arrows across the field at the Illionians.

A handful of men tumbled to the ground, but the Illionians continued their charge. They reached the horsemen, stabbing at their horses and riders with quick thrusts. The leader of the Scythians was disarmed, then he quickly surrendered.

But despite being the leader of the hunting party, it was clear he was no leader of the Scythians. He wore no jewelry, had no dyed clothes, and his bow was worn as if he hunted for food, not sport.

""Take me tah yer leader."" The chieftain gruffly demanded. With a spear at his throat, the Scythian had no choice but to lead the Illionians to the Scythian camp.",HistoricalWorldPowers,The Eastern Nomads,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/5bkqph/the_eastern_nomads/

---

""After that beast, you've almost got it!""

Two Illionian boys sprinted along the crest of the hill, making their way towards a galloping herd of horses. The faster of the two neared a wild stallion, then leapt on its back, clutching to its neck to stay on. 

The horse bucked and kicked, trying to free itself of this human, but the boy held on tight. The other ran over and managed to hop on its back as well, slowing the horse down. As its herd continued off in the distance, it eventually calmed down, and the boys led it back to their village.

The villagers were impressed, and soon began to replicate their success in capturing and riding horses. The animals eventually started to be herded into pastures, no longer wild and free.

**Walls and Gates**

---

""Those Tauri will be back, and dangerous.""

""Aye, let's do something about it then.""

The villages of Illion started to construct walls around their settlements in order to protect from the outside threats, namely, the Tauri, the people displaced by Illion.

The walls were made of roughly cut stone, stacked twenty feet high in some parts. Gates were made of logs bound together, hauled back and forth each time danger appeared. Inefficient, but it made do for now.

**Iron**

---

During one fire festival, a giant bonfire of hundreds of logs, sticks, and twigs was made, a surrounded by a few large rocks to ensure the embers did not burn the grassland around it.

As the fire burned, the rocks began to heat. By the end of the night, the rocks with red veins were discovered to turn into hunks of metal! The Illionians, curious about this strange rock type, have begun to gather up these red rocks and burn them until metallic.

These new metals can be molded into tools for farming, hunting, building, and even weapons of war. This iron will help greatly in the future.

**Mining**

---

Illionians have begun to head to the hills, seeking out the iron vein. They have started to become miners, drilling holes into the ground in search of the red vein. Torches light the dark chambers of the earth as the miners go deeper and deeper.

**Tows**

---
When the Illionians discovered what pain fire brought to their captives, their next thought was *How much pain can this bring to our enemies?*

Illionian archers have recently begun to tie tows to their arrows, a mixture of fibers dipped in resin. Dip the arrow in fire, and you're able to launch flames across the battlefield.

Illion archers are ready to try out these new arrows the next time they meet Tauri raiders.

**Ard**

---
The Illionians are an agricultural people, and have thus constantly been searching for more effective ways to bring about a harvest.

The Ard, a new plow, will help turn the fields for the next harvest, thus allowing the farmer more time to rest if he wishes after his fields have been turned quicker and better.

**Bathing** ***^Cultural ^Tech***

---
Nice warm tubs of water, heated by great fires, have been spotted at the fire festivals. The Illionians can relax in large pools of water, heating their entire body and providing a more relaxing part of the fire festivals.


**Cannabis** ***^Cultural ^Tech***

---
In addition to just bathing, the fire festivals have another step to relaxation. The cannabis plant, which can be found in the forests of Illion, are harvested and burned during the festival near the baths, a technique taken from the nearby Scythians 

Cannabis is also started to be used as a pain reliever for those injured in battle, tired of work, or aching with age.",HistoricalWorldPowers,Illion Research [900-800 BCE],https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/5b6hmd/illion_research_900800_bce/

Bar!"" screamed a Tauri woman, her barbarian language not understood by the Illionians. Had they spoken her language, they would have heard her begging for her life, but even if they did understand, they would not comply.

The Fire Festival was starting.

The woman, still kicking and screaming, was brought to a giant tower of dry wood from last season's lumber, stacked a hundred feet in the air. Two men grabbed her by her arms and climbed up to the top, secured her in place at the top of the tower, then scampered back down to the field below, where the Illionians gathered.

As the torches where prepared, a priest gave a speech on how this sacrifice would please the gods. By placing the human sacrifices higher in the air, and burning them into a small pile of light ashes they could head to the heavens faster. 

Behind the priest were two dozen of these tall wood towers in total. They were well crafted log towers with ladder-like slits cut into them to allow a prisoner to be transported up by climbers. At the top lay the prisoner, bound by rope.

The torchbearers advanced on the towers despite the screams of the Tauri, then set their flame on the base. The dry wood erupted into a large blaze, letting the flame spread rapidly to the top of the tower.

The prisoners screamed louder, but they were only heard for a few seconds. The blaze crackled and roared over the sounds of their pain. The Illionians cheered, the fire festival was complete!

Over the next few summer days, the Illionians would dance, fight, feast, and sing in these merry times before the harvest. As they continued to make war with the Tauri, there was no shortage of  sacrifices.",HistoricalWorldPowers,Fire Festival,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/5b29e7/fire_festival/

For generations, they had been at odds with the Tauri hunters over who owned the hunting grounds on the peninsula. 

It was time to settle the issue once and for all.

As the Illionian army closed in, a horn called out from the walls of the village, bringing the Tauri warriors out to the field. The Illionians picked up the pace from a march to a slow run.

The armies neared each other, the rumbling of more than a thousand men grew louder. The armies met, and the clashes and screams began.

Hundreds of men fell to the ground as a result of stabbing, skull-bashing, beating, and/or trampling. The Tauri chief fell after being surrounded by six Illionian warriors. He died with honor.

The battle lasted just an hour, but it would change the rest of time for the Tauri. After their defeat, their villages were burned by Illionian torches and their people forced to flee. Those who did not escape in time were taken back as slaves to Illion.

Panic quickly spread through the streets of Troy as the [Greeks began to massacre the unsuspecting Trojans.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/58nxz3/the_trojan_war/) A counterattack was launched, slowing down the Greek advance for just a moment. King Priam met with his family for one last time.

""Ilione, you're the eldest here. Take your brothers and sisters and anyone else looking to escape and flee far from here. I'm off to defend the altar!""

And with the unsheathing of his sword and a charge into battle, King Priam never saw his family again. A few of the young ones began to cry, but Ilione remained calm and somehow managed to not only gather her siblings, but thousands of other Trojans as well, and they fled.

The refugees were on the run from the Greek army for several days, knowing they could not return home, for the land would be salted and the buildings burnt. They eventually reached the Azov Sea in the battered Trojan fleet, safe from the Greeks at last.

Hundreds of years later, a proper civilization has been noted to be present in these lands, descendants of the Trojan exodus. They have spread across the fertile grasslands, becoming farmers, craftsmen, hunters, and fishermen.

Named after its first queen, this is the civilization of Illion.

The 35th Çanakkale Redif Division, 6th Bandırma Redif Division, 7th Afyonkarahisar Redif Division, and Balkan Division have all been called back from their positions in the far Balkans, as Constantinople is the priority now. During their departure, they have orders to warn Muslim citizens of oncoming foreign armies and encourage them back behind Ottoman lines. They are free to strip the Christians here of any possessions they wish during their departure to boost morale for the Thracian defense.

In addition, several other *Redif* divisions have been transferred from Anatolia to Rumelia, along with fresh supplies and guns.

Trenches are to be dug across the land of the Ottoman lines, and behind them trenches, and behind those trenches, more, so that if the front line falls, another one can be used to fall back on quickly. All Muslim men in Thrace will be drafted, all Christians and Jews will be moved to Constantinople with or without their families if they choose. The goal here is not advancing, but preserving life and, if possible, land.

If the lines break completely here, they will head back to the retreat zones, marked outside the capital and the straits zone.

The units at Erzerum are to hold until the defenses show signs of breaking completely, then pull back to a more defendable spot, with the exception of a few volunteering battalions who will stay behind and fight for the streets, ordered to die. With their sacrifice, the army can pull back and rest and prepare the next defenses.

The Ottoman 6th Army will respond to the German occupation forces by forming near Adana and crossing into occupied Hatay before moving down the coastline, at a cautious but not sluggish pace. If an engagement breaks out with enemy troops, Ottoman troops are ordered to strike quickly and pull back quickly, as a large scale conflict cannot be afforded at this time.

Although not even really an army, this unit is at least skilled in warfare in the desert and anti-guerrilla tactics. The Seventh army will move north through Hedjaz, gathering up tribal forces along the way as it advances into the Levant. The Seventh army is to use raid tactics along with the tribal forces on German units here as well as guerrilla tactics to disrupt German operations here. They also have orders to avoid large scale conflict unless it cannot be helped.

The Black Sea Fleet will be called into the capital zone. The Aegean Fleet will remain close to the Straits Defensive Zone.

Even though the nationalization process has gone well, there are still some faults in the system. Minorities of the christian faith and of foreign tongue still cling to their non-Turkish ways by sticking to their own villages. This situation is unacceptable, and will be fixed by the resettlement law in the following way:

* Those un-Turkish areas will be resettled by Turkish settlers to force assimilation of the non-Turks

* Areas still un-assimilated will resettle the non-Turks in heavily Turkish cities.

This law also applies to Muslims who have failed to become true Turks. Hopefully this law ensures  'unity in language, culture and blood'.

After a winter rest and reinforcement, the Turkish Iranian intervention is not yet over. The same strategy will be pursued: a slow but steady advancement of Turkish forces in the Azeri mountains.

During the advance, the Turkish air force is to be sent out to spot points of enemy strongholds in the mountain passes and the artillery is to blast them so that the infantry may advance.

Large scale battles are to be discouraged but not prohibited. While the casualties we may take during these firefights may bee high, our commanders are confident that they will be lower than the enemy's losses during such a battle.

The goal of the operation is to control the mountains and coastline on the west part of Lake Urmia. Once this goal is complete, the men will halt and wait for further orders while defending their gains.

The Thracian Line will assist the parts of the First Army in its defense of Thrace. They are not to dig in as much as to conserve energy, but wait for attacks and fortify the areas in which they are attacked. Because of the massive size of this line, the men are expected to be flexible. The cavalry will assist if the line is expected to quickly change after a break or enemy retreat.

The Salonik Line, led by Mustafa Kemal Pasha, will hold against Greek land and sea assaults. Military engineers here are to fortify the area similar to what is being done at the straits- artillery positioned on the hills and men garrisoned in trenches. They will hold on the bank of the river so the enemy must cross while attacking.

In a small, uninhabited section of Greenland, a few Norwegian separatists, gathered in a small cabin meant for weather monitoring, have declared Eastern Greenland to be ‘Erik the Red's Land’, a new province of Norway.

A cheer broke out across the Soviet lines. The Japanese were indeed retreating back to Korea, but they were going to be leaving a few things behind that the Soviets wouldn't like...

After a small celebration, the Soviet line moved forward cautiously at first to make sure this wasn't some great ruse. Then they picked up their speed as they reached the first line of the abandoned Japanese trenches, hoping to find a bit of loot.

But instead of finding gifts and goodies, they found gas and grenades. The Japanese traps exploded in the face of the Soviet men, causing hundreds of them to choke before they could even reach a mask.

Screams and explosions were heard as the bodies stung from gas, shrapnel, or both. When the Soviet commanders realized they were in for a stretch of explosives and such ahead of them, they pulled the men back and began to discuss what to do.

""Fuck those Ukrainians!"" is the general consensus of the commanders. The local Ukrainian people, who have been branded as traitors to the Soviet state, are forced to cross the land-mined field and get blown up and/or gassed so the Soviet troops can pass safely.

The people are brought out kicking and screaming, but eventually they cross their field after beatings, threats, and humiliations. Most of them die horrible deaths, and a few days later the Soviets cross the mined land and reach the real Japanese front line a few days later.

Soviet Losses: 2k

Now the true battle can begin. Soviet troops pour forward in a massive human wave as the artillery rains down on Japanese lines. Fresh ammunition is loaded into Japanese rifles and fired at the horde, but it's not enough! Soviet armor and boots enter Japanese trenches and manage to take it and hold it.

Due to the freezing weather, neither side can advance much further. The Japanese don't want to die frozen in the snow while fighting over their lost line, and the Soviets don't want to march through the cold on their way to Korea.

And now the Japanese front line has been taken by Soviet forces, with a good amount of losses [58/100]. They start securing the trenches and more men pile into the well-worn ditches.

But those tricky Japenese, ooh they're real tricksters, those Japanese commanders! They've really coaxed the Soviets into a snafu now, because they have arranged their *second* line into a semi-circle that has surrounded the Soviets who foolishly charged into the trenches like there was no tomorrow!

The Japanese have held out against the Soviets yet again, but not without great cost. Men from both sides are eager to return home in this time of great economic turmoil. Japanese commanders report that nearly all of their ammo has been used up by this massive troop movement to the frontline. If there is to be another battle, the men must either leave the lines of a staggering amount of ammo must be delivered.

Soviet commanders also complain. They request that the 500k men be redrafted so that they can crush the enemy faster.

The Italians wipe the sweat off their brows as they leave the safety of the coast and head inland, while their Senussi opponents gather for a quick prayer before heading north or fortifying themselves within the towns.

Late in the morning, the forces have their first engagement between the settlements of Tobruk and Al Jaghbub. Both sides find themselves surprised by the other, and while the Italians scramble to get into formation the Senussi are able to charge at them.

Despite the Italians having more men and firepower, the attack goes better than expected. The Senussi cavalry ride into the Italian lines and shoot and slash up the infantry, while mostly dodging enemy field gun fire.

The Senussi pull back and recompose themselves before releasing another deadly charge on the helpless Italians, who are now starting to retreat back to Tobruk. The Purple Group is defeated, leaving behind the bodies of eight hundred men, a few dozen dead horses, and almost a thousand rifles.

But the Senussi are also not without losses. Two hundred of them fell in battle, and quite a bit suffer injuries, so the commander decides to split them up. A few will carry back the Italian equipment south so they can arm even more recruits, while the rest will harass the Italians as they retreat.

And so while the purple group loses more men due to cavalry swooping in and shooting them, the red group continues south without any raiders bothering them, eventually reaching Awjilah, where the Senussi wait for them. They stop and let the planes fly over to collect a bit of data on enemy forces and drop a few bombs at the same time. When the report comes back that the Libyans have much fewer men than the Italians, the commander smiles with glee.

*""Attackacino!""* he cries as the guns begin to fire on the city's defenses. The Senussi defenders can only cower and hide while the walls and buildings around them crumble into little bits of dust. When the bombardment is over, the Italians are already nearing the gates, led by tanks and cavalry.

The Italians face a bit of resistance while taking the city, but not by much. While most of the Senussi retreat south, a hundred defenders remain in the city and fight to the death, often carrying out last stands and suicidal charges.

#Phase 1

Polish Front
---

All men of Poland, even the young ones, are rounded up by government recruiters and shipped to a basic training before heading out to the front with a rifle and no white garments for surrender [13/20]. A few hide away or fake injuries, but the recruiting goes decently.

Far away in Kiev, where the Polish soldiers are headed, the local government has declared the city to be in danger and have thus attempted to arm and recruit the civilians nearby into a garrison and indoctrinate them with propaganda. But the Ukrainians remember the Polish soldiers fondly from the last war and do not join the garrison, but instead riot against Soviet rule instead [2/20]!

---

**North**

Up in the North, due to the sun shining and the birds singing, the Polish men have high morale and are ready for battle [19/20]. They move towards the less-happy Soviets [13/20], who sit glumly in the trenches because singing birds are imperialistic and the sun is a member of the bourgeoisie. 

Polish planes fly over to find artillery positions, but too many are shot down for good information to be found [3/10]. They manage to fly back as the Soviet guns begin their first round of fire on Polish lines to prepare for an attack.

After a weak strike [6/20], the Soviets make a daring charge across the field and capture the Polish trenches due to their superior numbers. The Poles start a counterattack with their better bombardment [14/20], but can't take back the trenches in the first attack [48/100]. After another charge, the Poles take it back [94/100], but can't advance due to their high losses.

**Center**

Here, in the center, the birds do not sing as much and the sun is not as bright, which now makes the Soviets happier [19/20] than the Poles [13/20]. 

The Polish air force sets out to scout the Soviet Artillery here, but is almost entirely shot down by Soviet machine guns [1/10]. With no info gathered on the enemy, the Poles must simply wait as they are blown to bits by a strong Soviet Artillery strike [15/20]. They attempt to resist, but it's futile as the Soviets take the trenches with ease and superior numbers.

The Poles know they have no chance of counterattacking, so they simply fall back.

**South**

Here in the South, Polish lines are stretched thin but the men manage to make the best of their surroundings, [each playing traditional songs from their village to raise morale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syMhJMmGEIc) [12/20]. Meanwhile the Soviets hear the music and become so sad and homesick that they decide not to follow any orders of attacking and just sit in trenches crying [1/20].

Poor conditions result in Polish artillery doing badly on the attack, missing their targets quite often [5/20]. But in the attacks, they manage to push back the Soviets a little bit [94/100], resulting in the fall of Kiev. Polish troops are welcomed as heroes by the local Ukrainians, who join forces with them.

Japanese Front
---

**North**


Far up in the north, Japanese Marines land in the freezing ports of the Far East [5/10] and shoot up a few policemen in the area [48/100] with few losses. With no other resistance in the area, they declare themselves occupiers, and the local people don't really care.

A few ships pass by and then bomb more infrastructure, resulting in a few lost houses and lives [12/20].

**Frontlines**

Down near the front, both sides don't really press for large attacks. Japan bombs the Soviets [7/20] and the Soviets bomb them back [12/20]

#Phase 2

Polish Front
---

**North**

As the troops sit in the trenches, they hear about the stock market crash, which makes the soldiers very sad, since they figured they would invest in the stock market after the war. After Soviet commanders make fun of their men for trying to invest in stocks while being communists, they become even sadder than the Poles [7/20] and are now miserable [5/20].

Still, both sides head out on the attack. The Soviets show their sadness by barely bombing the Poles [6/20] and then accept the sweet release of death as they charge on the attack [18/100][4/100]. Polish soldiers, seeing their chance to attack the weak Soviets, start firing back with their artillery.

After several great strikes [18/20], the Poles charge like heroic Hussars! It's a brave and gallant charge into battle for the freedom of Poland but then they die [19/100].

**Center**

In the center, Polish troops are not told of the Stock Market crash and they too sings the songs of their people which makes them happy [17/20]. But on the Soviet side, the army's dancing bear mascot died and this demoralizes them very much and they refuse to follow orders [1/20].

The Poles attack in the Soviets' moment of weakness with a good artillery strike [12/20], but they can't reach the trenches with their full force [32/100], so the battle ends with no change in land.

**South**

In the south, the Poles celebrate with their new Ukrainian comrades, resulting in a  great morale boost [19/20]! But the Soviets, eager for revenge and ready to trap the Polish forces, are also prepared for battle [16/20].

Soviet guns hammer the Polish-Ukrainian positions, but for some reason the men forget how to fire their guns and they all die very quickly [2/100]. The Poles use this as an opportunity to attack, and they once again smash through Soviet lines [14/20][84/100]!

Japanese Front
---

Japanese marines decide that it's too cold to continue to attack up the peninsula, so they sit around a fire [1/10].

Meanwhile both sides just shoot artillery back and forth.

The Baltic Union Central Government has crushed the protesters without mercy after the Finnish officers refused to surrender, and the Finnish public has been less then happy about this. Nationalistic Finnish papers printed more-or-less exaggerated accounts of Finnish officers being beheaded or fed to dogs.

Now a few smaller cities have begun to protest, calling for Baltic troops to leave the country and for the Finnish people to decide on their own whether they want to remain a part of this violent Baltic Union.

On one hand, they could let the referendum happen with grace. On the other, these guns don't fire themselves.

Germany

Riots have broken out on he island of Heligoland, the small patch of grass off the northern coast of Germany. Due to the poor economic and political climate of Germany, they demand to return to British rule. Police reports show that pro-German newspaper printing buildings have been attacked and their stock destroyed.

The Nazi Party continues its rallies, this time in Nuremberg with the Fourth Party Congress. 60,000 people were said to be in attendance, listening to the far-right rhetoric of the Nazis.

Said one rally-goer: ""I just think that these Nazis guys are great fellows. If they were in charge nothing could go wrong!""

Worrying news for other parties in the next election.

Romania

In the mining town of Lupeni, workers have begun to protest. After years of violence and trouble in Romania, men and women have died, leaving the workforce thin. But the managers still demand high profits, leading to a massive lack of rights and safety for the workers.

The local governors are prepared to shoot up the rioters with the help of police forces, but need approval from the national government. Are they allowed to blast up these dirty pinko miners?

On the streets of Poland, recruiters sigh in frustration as they fail to find the large numbers needed to fill their quotas. Despite promises of glory, adventure, and exotic dancers grinding up on them, Poles just don't want to join the army after many years of war [10/20][1/20][5/20].

**North**

Polish officers in the trenches, likely angry at the lack of men, want nothing more than to just sit in in their cot and drink away in peace due to the upcoming battle. But they get no relaxation, as Soviet guns bomb their positions all night long. Men from both sides are now cranky, scared, tired, or a combination of them.

Despite the lack of sleep, the Poles are wide-eyed and awake for the battle, possibly due to the thousand-yard-stare [18/20]. Soviet troops, again facing another mass charge, are less excited than the Poles [11/20].

Then the battle begins. After a heavy night bombardment, all the Soviet forces charge at once, resulting in chaos [5/20]. Some men are trampled by boots, others are cut by friendly bayonets, a handful and crushed by tank treads, and one man is reportedly killed after being stomped on by a mad horse.

And that's not the worst of it. As soon as the Soviets reach the Polish lines, they are subject to enemy machine gun-, rifle-, and artillery- fire.

But that doesn't stop them. When such a large force charges at a smaller one, it's unlikely they'll fail. Soviet troops pour into the trench like water spilling into a trough, killing the Polish defenders there [91/100]

In a desperate attempt to retake the trenches, Polish guns start bombing their former defenses to little tiny bits [15/20], and reinforcements attempt to retake the trench [21/100], but it's too late- the Trench is red. Bloody and Soviet.

After the Polish attack dies down, the Soviets decide not to advance any further due to high losses and the cold [1/10], despite the rest of the advance being open to attack.

**Center**

In this part of the Polish lines, reinforcements are scarce, and morale is falling quite quickly. It seemed like Polish troops would break and head back to Warsaw at any sight of a Soviet advance until a traveling circus and Gypsy dancers showed up, lifting the spirits of the troops [10/20].

But unlike the decadent west, the Soviets do not need entertainment to fight. Each soldier is given an extra potato, and the men are ready for battle and revolutionary singing [19/20].

The Soviets begin with a successful artillery attack [19/20] which disorients the Polish line and causes it to break at a few points. Soviet troops head forward, but something stops them from attacking at normal effectiveness- mud and ice. At some points the battlefield is slippery, in others it is sticky.

A few Soviet troops used to the winter manage to cross the line and begin taking the trenches [25/100], where they are helped by a Polish counter-artillery strike that hurts more Poles than it does Soviets [2/20].

The Reds almost have this trench too, so close! But the arrival of Polish backup results in the loss of the trench, and no side gains land [65/100].

**South**

In the South, Polish troops are well prepared [12/20] for the Soviet forces, who surround them, but not as prepared as the Soviets, who are eager to crush the stretched Polish lines [15/20].

Soviet artillery, now some of the best in the world because of how many times they've fired, strike Polish lines with great force [14/20], which'll help Soviet Infantry take the lines.

But just before the battle, an officer of the Soviet forces stole a doll from a local gypsy girl and laughed in her face. The girl ran home to her grandmother, and the old lady put a curse on the Soviet forces.

And the curse shows. Despite surrounding the Poles from three sides, the Soviets launch three attacks resulting in much more dead Soviets than it does Poles [25/100][14/100][1/100]. The officer with the stolen doll has his squad instantly gunned down by machine gun fire as they advance, and he is trapped under the bodies of his comrades.

Then the Poles advance! While the artillery is poor [8/20], the Soviet defense is even poorer. One attack broke completely, leaving a section undefended, and Polish troops advance there but not other areas [39/100].

After the battle, the cursed officer commits suicide, resulting in the curse ending.

Soviet Losses: 70k

Polish Losses: 48k

Way over in the Far East, the Japanese have resumed their advances for the first time in many months, and the troops are now excited [16/20]! Despite the number of reinforcements being low [2/20], they still have fresh men and supplies coming in, unlike the Soviets.

The artillery lights up and fires on Soviet forces [13/20] and the planes fly overhead, but don't really do anything to help the Japanese. After the battle, it is revealed that the pilots misread the orders 'scout and assist the attack' as 'just sight-see and don't help the battle'.

Then the Japanese charge, screaming at the top of their lungs to scare the Soviets. This move works, as the Soviets can't hold out against multiple deadly Japanese attacks [94/100][92/100][38/100].

Meanwhile, the Japanese Marines manage to land decently while under fire. While they can't take the province [73/100], they do secure the islands and inflict losses on the Soviets.

Polish Front

**North**

In the North, the Poles were more ready for their offensive [14/20] than the Soviets were [10/20]. The red forces rushed into battle first quite nervously, and were punished for it.

Their artillery strikes were mediocre [9/20], and almost all of their waves ended in disaster [35/100][14/100][32/100]! But these thousands of men who died did do one thing right- tire the Poles.

As they attempted to counterattack, their artillery nearly ran out of shot [6/20] and their advances were weak [40/100]. Despite this, they did manage to liberate an Eastern province from Soviet control.


**Center**

This area has seen the harshest fighting of the war, as trees have been torn from the Earth and civilians and their former houses are to be found scattered in the mud. Both sides feel the effect of the dying land, and both have shit morale [4/20].

The Soviets lead one halfhearted attack, with the artillery barely finding its mark [8/20]. But as the troops are sludging through the mud on their advance, a group of tanks rushes by and Trotsky pops out of a hatch. This inspires the men to job to the front line, which they take [97/100].

The Polish counterattack is an extreme failure, not from the artillery, who manage to hold the Soviets back, but the advance squads, and they fall back even further [14/20][9/100].

**South**

In the South, both sides are also equally ready for battle, but this time not depressed about their surroundings [13/20].

Polish artillery opens fire as they make the first attack, and it clears the way for a well-coordinated attack [11/20][71/100].

The Soviets manage to blast the Poles back a bit [18/20], but the infantry spoils all gains made by their comrades after two poor attacks [29/100][2/100].

Far Eastern Front

No battle occurs. A small group of Japanese marines manage to blow up railroads, roads, communication equipment, and supply caravans without being spotted. Chaos spreads among Soviet lines, as they cannot receive reinforcements for the next phase because of this.

(1) Slavery is the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised.

(2) The slave trade includes all acts involved in the capture, acquisition or disposal of a person with intent to reduce him to slavery; all acts involved in the acquisition of a slave with a view to selling or exchanging him; all acts of disposal by sale or exchange of a slave acquired with a view to being sold or exchanged, and, in general, every act of trade or transport in slaves.

**Article 2**

The High Contracting Parties undertake, each in respect of the territories placed under its sovereignty, jurisdiction, protection, suzerainty or tutelage, so far as they have not already taken the necessary steps:

( a ) To prevent and suppress the slave trade;

( b ) To bring about, progressively and as soon as possible, the complete abolition of slavery in all its forms.

**Article 3** 

The High Contracting Parties undertake to adopt all appropriate measures with a view to preventing and suppressing the embarkation, disembarkation and transport of slaves in their territorial waters and upon all vessels flying their respective flags.

**Article 4**

Those of the High Contracting Parties whose laws do not at present make adquate provision for the punishment of infractions of laws and regulations enacted with a view to giving effect to the purposes of the present Convention undertake to adopt the necessary measures in order that severe penalties may be imposed in respect of such infractions.

**Article 5**

Any countries signing and found not enforcing anti-slavery laws in their nation or not reporting slavery found in other nations will be reprimanded and possibly removed from the League.

Arabic words would also be replaced with archaic Turkic words if possible, anything to remove foreign influences from this nationalist government's reform.

These groups wished to impose their goals on the dying empire, some to reform it, others to carve a chunk out of it.

The *Vatan ve Hürriyet* seeks to end the autocratic rule of the Ottoman Sultan and his Grand Vizer and give the land a republican form of government, as well as protect what it considers the 'Turkish homeland' from danger.

*Turanists*

Turanists, or Pan-Turkics, are the kind of nationalists who call for the creation of a massive Turkic Empire, one with Turks, Azeris, Turcomen, Turkmen, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Tartars, and other Turkic people. These sorts of men include the late [Enver Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Pasha) and other former fighters from the Turkic faction of the Russian Civil War.

They prefer to make  bold statements of genociding all non Turks in the area and letting [Yörüks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C3%B6r%C3%BCks) freely roam the land. They also enjoy archery, horseback riding, and [drawing maps like this](http://s16.postimg.org/hzjfimput/Turan.png).

*Anatolianists*

This group of Nationalists are the ones who call for Anatolian Turks to be what defines a Turk. They celebrate the [Battle of Manzikert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manzikert) and consider the siege of Constantinople to be a liberation. In their eyes, Turks have been destined to be in Anatolia and all other groups should leave or die.

They hold the Turan idea in poor light, as they see other Turkic peoples as uncivilized barbarian nomads. They prefer that all these Turkic people come to Anatolia and settle down properly.

---
*Kemalists*

This group is the most aligned with the President's views. They call for a strong Turkish nation state in any area, preferably one with Turks. All those who don't speak Turkish and follow Turkish ways are to be assimilated into a western Turkish identity.

They are also very secular, and they laugh at the face of Pan-Islamists and all those who use religion as a political tool. If it was up to them, Turkey would speak 100% Turkish, act 100% Turkish, and have little religious influences.

After a bit of debate within the Grand Nationalist Assembly, the republic of Turkey has decided to launch the ""Citizen, speak Turkish!"" Campaign. This campaign is aimed at getting non-Turkish speaking minorities to speak Turkish, or else.

In schools, the Turkish language will be taught extensively in non-Turkish municipalities. Non-Turkish children should learn the Turkish language, hopefully integrating in the country better in the future as well as encouraging their parents to learn Turkish.

In the streets, writings not in Turkish will be required to have a Turkish translation in a larger, more noticeable font. Those citizens who speak in another language besides Turkish are to be fined unless they can prove that they can speak Turkish properly.

*""You couldn't even if you tried, you sheep-lover!""*

The 'Sheep-lover' rushed at the 'scum', his hands balled into fists, his mouth letting loose a war cry, and his brain determined to trike his opponent.

The 'scum' saw this attack coming and sidestepped but left his leg outstretched. As planned, the 'sheep-lover' tripped over the leg and fell face-first into the dirt. The 'scum' advanced on his opponent and held his chest down with his knees and grabbed his arms, then forced the 'sheep-lover' to hit his own face with his arms.

*""Why are you hitting yourself, why are you hitting yourself, why are you hitting yourself?""* The 'scum' teased, enjoying the humiliation and beating of his opponent.

Now a crowd had started to gather and nobody knew how to solve this. Eventually, a community elder was rushed to the scene, where a bloodied 'sheep lover' was kicking the bruised 'scum' on the floor. The elder made his way to the front of the crowd and bellowed at the top of his lungs:

*""Are you two man or beast? Stop kicking him, Sapinuwa! Get up off the ground, Nerik!""*

The two men stopped their fight and looked up at the elder, embarrassed. The 'sheep-lover', whose actual name was Sapinuwa, stopped kicking the 'scum', whose name was Nerik, and wiped the blood off of his face. Nerik stood up and dusted the dirt off of his tunic.

The community elder looked at them, anger clearly in his eyes. *""What is it you men fight over? Pride? That is no way for man to act!""*

Then he turned to the crowd who had gathered to watch the fight but had done nothing. *""You let these men trade blows and insults for your own enjoyment? You all disgust me!""*

The elder hobbled over to a a raised stone and climbed on top of it, staring off into the hills in the distance, in deep thought. All of these would have to be taught a lesson, but how? 

The old man continued to stare off into the distance. The crowd began to whisper and mummer to each other while they waited on his announcement. Finally he turned around, facing the crowd and bringing it to silence.

*""Since all of you act like beasts, you shall live among beasts. All those who fought and gathered to watch the fight on this day are now exiled from Hattush.""*

The crowd began to scream in fear and anger. Nerik shouted that he didn't want to live in exile with Sapinuwa, who said the same about Nerik. Other members of the crowd tried to beg for forgiveness from the old man, but his mind has already been made.

*""You must leave before the sun sets tonight, pack your belongings. If you don't want to live with Nerik or Sapinuwa, I don't care, go your separate ways. Just stay away from Hattush!""*

And so, as the sun set on the settlement of Hattush, two groups left the city. 

Sapinuwa, whose legs were tired from kicking Nerik, could not go far. With his followers, he founded the settlement on the hills not to far from Hattush. Its [buildings were made of local stone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Sapinuwa3.jpg), and after many generations, it was known after its founder, Sapinuwa.

Nerik, a much more prideful man, decided to go farther than Sapinuwa, and settled his home far from Hattush. His settlement used [stone for writing tablets](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h5/h5_66.245.5b.jpg), and on most of those tablets were the scratches of Nerik himself, writing down how much he beat up Sapinuwa and how much greater the warriors of his village were. Over time, this settlement would also be known after its founder.

A turn of the handlebar lifts one stabilizing wheel and lowers the other, shifting the balance of the machine and turning it to one side or the other. An internal gear mechanism, operated by a motor inside the body, drives the wheel ahead at remarkable speed.

&gt; By a simple process of inverting the streamlined pants on the stabilizing wheels, so they form balancing floats, and attaching propelling fins to the main wheel, the tank can be turned into an amphibian capable of plunging into a stream and rolling to the other side.

&gt; One of the oddest features of the revolutionary machine is formed by the steel-tube crutches that project ahead on either side like medieval lances. As the tank rushes upon a trench or obstruction, the operator will drop the tubes so they dig into the earth and the whole machine will vault through the air to the other side. An open-type form of the vehicle, which is shown on our cover, has also been devised by the inventor. Without the armored body or the crutches, it is designed for highway use.

In order to prevent future ethnic tensions, both sides are willing to exchange their minorities to ensure a peaceful future.

While the definitions of 'Greek' and 'Turk' are Ottoman-like, dividing based on religion and not language, resulting in Greek-speaking Muslims in Turkey and Turkish-speaking Christians in Greece, the treaty is expected to go through.

*Article 1*

There shall take place a compulsory exchange of Turkish nationals of the Greek Orthodox religion established in Turkish nationals of the Greek Orthodox religion established in Turkish territory, and of Greek nationals of the Moslem religion established in Greek territory.

Conference on the Straits
---

**Article 1**

The High Contracting Parties agree to recognise and declare the principle of freedom of transit and of navigation by sea and by air in the Strait of the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmora and the Bosphorus, hereinafter comprised under the general term of the ""Straits.""

**Article 2**

The transit and navigation of commercial vessels and aircraft, and of war vessels and aircraft in the Straits in time of peace and in time of war shall henceforth be regulated by the provisions of the attached Annex.

ANNEX.	Edit
Rules for the Passage of Commercial Vessels and Aircraft, and of War Vessels and Aircraft through the Straits.

1. Merchant Vessels, including Hospital Ships, Yachts and Fishing Vessels and non-Military Aircraft.

(a) In Time of Peace.

Complete freedom of navigation and passage by day and by night under any flag and with any kind of cargo, without any formalities, or tax, or charge whatever (subject, however, to international sanitary provisions) unless for services directly rendered, such as pilotage, light, towage or other similar charges, and without prejudice to the rights exercised in this respect by the services and undertakings now operating under concessions granted by the Turkish Government.

To facilitate the collection of these dues, merchant vessels passing the Straits will communicate to stations appointed by the Turkish Government their name, nationality, tonnage and destination.

Pilotage remains optional.

(b) In Time of War, Turkey being Neutral.

Complete freedom of navigation and passage by day and by night under the same conditions as above. The duties and rights of Turkey as a neutral Power cannot authorise her to take any measures liable to interfere with navigation through the Straits, the waters of which, and the air above which, must remain entirely free in time of war, Turkey being neutral just as in time of peace.

Pilotage remains optional.

(c) In Time of War, Turkey being a Belligerent.

Freedom of navigation for neutral vessels and neutral non-military aircraft, if the vessel or aircraft in question does not assist the enemy, particularly by carrying contraband, troops or enemy nationals. Turkey will have the right to visit and search such vessels and aircraft, and for this purpose aircraft are to alight on the ground or on the sea in such areas as are specified and prepared for this purpose by Turkey. The rights of Turkey to apply to enemy vessels the measures allowed by international law are not affected.

Turkey will have full power to take such measures as she may consider necessary to prevent enemy vessels from using the Straits. These measures, however, are not to be of such a nature as to prevent the free passage of neutral vessels, and Turkey agrees to provide such vessels with either the necessary instruction or pilots for the above purpose.

2. Warships, induding Fleet Auxiliaries, Troopships, Aircraft Carriers and Military Aircraft.

(a) In Time of Peace.

Complete freedom of passage by day and by night under any flag, without any formalities, or tax, or charge whatever, but subject to the following restrictions as to the total force:

The maximum force which any one Power may send through the Straits into the Black Sea is not to be greater than that of the most powerful fleet of the littoral Powers of the Black Sea existing in that sea at the time of passage; but with the proviso that the Powers reserve to themselves the right to send into the Black Sea, at all times and under all circumstances, a force of not more than three ships, of which no individual ship shall exceed 10,000 tons.

Turkey has no responsibility in regard to the number of war vessels which pass through the Straits.

In order to enable the above rule to be observed, the Straits Commission provided for in Article 10 will, on the 1st January and the 1st July of each year, enquire of each Black Sea littoral Power the number of each of the following classes of vessel which such Power possesses in the Black Sea: Battle-ships, battle-cruisers, aircraft-carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, or other types of vessels as well as naval aircraft; distinguishing between the ships which are in active commission and the ships with reduced complements, the ships in reserve and the ships undergoing repairs or alterations.

The Straits Commission will then inform the Powers concerned that the strongest naval force in the Black Sea comprises: Battleships, battle-cruisers, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, aircraft and units of other types which may exist. The Straits Commission will also immediately inform the Powers concerned when, owing to the passage into or out of the Black Sea of any ship of the strongest Black Sea force, any alteration in tha[sic] force has taken place.

The naval force that may be sent through the Straits into the Black Sea will be calculated on the number and type of the ships of war in active commission only.

(b) In Time of War, Turkey being Neutral.

Complete freedom of passage by day and by night under any flag, without any formalities, or tax, or charge whatever, under the same limitations as in paragraph 2 (a),

However, these limitations will not be applicable to any belligerent Power to the prejudice of its belligerent rights in the Black Sea.

The rights and duties of Turkey as a neutral Power cannot authorise her to take any measures liable to interfere with navigation through the Straits, the waters of which, and the air above which, must remain entirely free in time of war, Turkey being neutral, just as in time of peace.

Warships and military aircraft of belligerents will be forbidden to make any capture, to exercise the right of visit and search, or to carry out any other hostile act in the Straits

As regards revictualling and carrying out repairs, war vessels will be subject to the terms of the Thirteenth Hague Convention of 1907, dealing with maritime neutrality.

Military aircraft will receive in the Straits similar treatment to that accorded under the Thirteenth Hague Convention of 1907 to warships, pending the conclusion of an international Convention establishing the rules of neutrality for aircraft.

(c) In Time of War, Turkey being Belligerent.

Complete freedom of passage for neutral warships, without any formalities, or tax, or charge whatever, but under the same limitations as in paragraph 2 (a).

The measures taken by Turkey to prevent enemy ships and aircraft from using the Straits are not to be of such a nature as to prevent the free passage of neutral ships and aircraft, and Turkey agrees to provide the said ships and aircraft with either the necessary instructions or pilots for the above purpose.

Neutral military aircraft will make the passage of the Straits at their own risk and peril, and will submit to investigation as to their character. For this purpose aircraft are to alight on the ground or on the sea in such areas as are specified and prepared for this purpose by Turkey.

3. (a) The passage of the Straits by submarines of Powers at peace with Turkey must be made on the surface.

(b) The officer in command of a foreign naval force, whether coming from the Mediterranean or the Black Sea, will communicate, without being compelled to stop, to a signal station at the entrance to the Dardanelles or the Bosphorus, the number and the names of vessels under his orders which are entering the Straits.

These signal stations shall be notified from time to time by Turkey; until such signal stations are notified, the freedom of passage for foreign war vessels in the Straits shall not thereby be prejudiced, nor shall their entry into the Straits be for this reason delayed.

(c) The right of military and non-military aircraft to fly over the Straits, under the conditions laid down in the present rules, necessitates for aircraft:

(i) Freedom to fly over a strip of territory of five kilometres on each side of the narrow parts of the Straits;

(ii) Liberty, in the event of a forced landing, to alight on the coast or on the sea in the territorial waters of Turkey.

4. Limitation of Time of Transit for Warships. In no event shall warships in transit through the Straits, except in the event of damage or peril of the sea, remain therein beyond the time which is necessary for them to effect their passage, including the time of anchorage during the night if necessary for safety of navigation.

5. Stay in the Ports of the Straits and of the Black Sea.

(a) Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Annex apply to the passage of vessels, warships and aircraft through and over the Straits and do not affect the right of Turkey to make such regulations as she may consider necessary regarding the number of men-of-war and military aircraft of any one Power which may visit Turkish ports or aerodromes at one time, and the duration of their stay.

(b) Littoral Powers of the Black Sea will also have a similar right as regards their ports and aerodromes.

(c) The light-vessels which the Powers at present represented on the European Commission of the Danube maintain as stationnaires at the mouths of that river as far up as Galatz will be regarded as additional to the men-of-war referred to in paragraph 2, and may be replaced in case of need.

6. Special Provisions relating to Sanitary Protection.

Warships which have on board cases of plague, cholera or typhus, or which have had such cases on board during the last seven days, and warships which have left an infected port within less than five times 24 hours must pass through the Straits in quarantine and apply by the means on board such prophylactic measures as are necessary to prevent any possibility of the Straits being infected.

The same rule shall apply to merchant ships having a doctor on board and passing straight through the Straits without calling at a port or breaking bulk.

Merchant ships not having a doctor on board shall be obliged to comply with the international sanitary regulations before entering the Straits, even if they are not to call at a port therein.

Warships and merchant vessels calling at one of the ports in the Straits shall be subject in that port to the international sanitary regulations applicable in the port in question.

*The zones and islands indicated below shall be demilitarised:*

* *The Prince Islands*

**Article 5**

Anatolia is war-torn, which isn't a great situation for a country that is entering its cold season. Most Turks who lived on former battlefields find themselves lacking food, water, shelter, or a combination of the ails. [Widows and orphans](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Greek_mother_%26_child_waiting_in_camp_at_Salonica_for_continuation_of_journey_from_the_Caucasus_to_Thrace_LCCN2001705752.jpg) walk the streets much more frequently now, their fathers and husbands either dead or forever missing.

Due to the land falling victim to the [Greek scorched-earth campaign](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Burnt_Locomotive%2C_U%C5%9Fak.jpg), the Grand National Assembly finds itself in a position where rebuilding is needed, and fast.

First, [Mustafa Kemal](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Ataturk_is_in_Kocatepe.jpg) has ordered that the amount of troops currently staring down the British near Constantinople be lessened by two Corps. These troops will [march inland](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Turkish_troops_en_route_to_the_Suez_Canal%2C_1914.JPG) to assist the [engineering](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Turkish_heliograph_at_Huj.jpg) and[ surveying](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/TurkishFieldTelephone.jpg) teams, who are to report on the status of the land as well as creating a rebuilding report on cost, time, and effort needed.

Next, comes the rebuilding process. The two corps will be turned into labor divisions to help construct the most basic infrastructure first, such as [new railroad tracks](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Railroad_Station_Beer_Sheva_1917.jpg) to bring supplies inland, [field hospitals](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-2007-0142%2C_T%C3%BCrkei%2C_Gallipoli%2C_Lazarett.jpg) to care for the people, and [temporary houses](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Old_Turkish_style_house_in_Bucharest%2C_1860.jpg) to shelter them.

The Grand National Assembly must also find a place to call home, a new capital for the nation. Seeing as how Constantinople was nearly taken in past wars, the war-torn town of [Eskişehir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eski%C5%9Fehir) has been declared the capital. While it seems odd to declare a [pile of rubble](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Destroyed_Turkish_village_of_Mulk.png) a capital, this location is both inland and easy to defend as well as the site of a [bitter battle](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWWP/comments/4xsbdm/battle_the_turkish_war_of_independence_december/) which defined [Turkish determination](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Turkish_cavalry_during_mopping%E2%80%90up_operation_1922.jpg) in the war of independence. 

Eskişehir is also planned to be transformed into a [modern European-style city](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Banks_Street_\(Atat%C3%BCrk_Boulevard\)_the_Building_of_Ziraat_Bankas%C4%B1_\(Agricultural_Bank\),_1930s_\(16851406391\).jpg), a place where the Grand National Assembly and the Turkish people alike would be proud to call their home.

In the sleepy fishing town of [Bodrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodrum), [Aidin Elayet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidin_Eyalet), a few Zeybeks sit on the [steps of an ancient theater](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Halicarnassus_Theatre.jpg), protected from the sweltering sun by a cloth tarp, a group effort if the sheep, shears, and craft of  the workers of the area. A small breeze of salty, cool air blows in from the Aegean, allowing hawks to fly overhead, cawing at one another.

Hawks. The symbol of the Zeybeks. With their arrival comes an election of a new *Efe*- the leader of the Zeybeks. An *Efe* must protect the local people from bandits, invaders, and harsh lawmen. An *Efe* must be willing to fight- nay, die, for his people, such as the case of [Atçalı Kel Mehmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At%C3%A7al%C4%B1_Kel_Mehmet), who fell fighting [Mahmud II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_II) and his cruelty towards the people of the Elayet.

The election starts as it always does- with dance. A small group of local men dressed in bright colors and fancy garbs take the stage, and begin their [dance](https://youtu.be/_wNYOz3VwAQ) as the band slowly starts to play. They dance as if they are hawks- flying freely through the region, swooping down when they wish. That is the way of a Zeybek.

After a few minutes of graceful dancers making movements in the breeze, the audience applauds and allows the dancers to make their way off stage. For now the election is to begin.

""People of Aidin and my fellow Zeybeks, we gather here in these ancient *Rumli* ruins to elect a new *Efe*, one who will lead us to greatness!"" An old Zeybek, with a back  curved like a bow and a face like old leather, announces. He raises a shaky hand, one worn by battle and trouble, and points it at one man sitting next to the stage.

""We have Kemal Baba, master of the Zeybeks of the land!""

[Kemal Baba](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b0/17/e5/b017e5ce23a3fecfdf0bbc57697d690a.jpg) (known simply as Kebab), a man of great strength and an even greater mustache, rises from his seat. He gives a great smile on his scarred face and gives the audience a wave with his free hand. The other rests on his chest, holding his belt of ammunition in place.

He would be a good *Efe*. He is well respected among the farmers, an important class in Aidin, but also, a bit controversially, the Greeks. His wife is a Christian, sister of a [*Armatoloi*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armatoloi), which may help in securing an alliance with this group.

The old Zeybek continues: ""There is Mustafa Bey, of the Sea!""

[Mustafa Bey](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/8a/38/7f/8a387fc733763550de463668698f371b.jpg), the most traveled of any man here, is a former Pirate from the Barbary region who decided to settle down in Bodrum when he saw the British fleet on his tail. 

He would also be a fine *Efe*. He has seen different places and peoples in his time at sea, and is well aware of the advancements of Western Europe. While some consider him an outsider, others consider him a modernizer, the way into the future. He gives a small smile and wave to the audience as well.

The old Zeybek points to the last man: ""And now for Selçuk Apo!""

[Selçuk Apo](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/1e/de/f7/1edef7d88eae579ea0fd8c17c9b044c9.jpg) stands and barely gives a nod to the audience before sitting back down. His eyes shift back and forth, always watching. As a former military man, he has seen combat many times. His eyes and ears are always on alert, ready for the next engagement.

He was employed by the Sultan, along with other young men, to [put down the Janissaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auspicious_Incident). As men were burned to death and hacked to pieces, all Selçuk Apo could do was follow orders- and massacre every Janissary he saw.

Selçuk would be an unpredictable *Efe*. Nobody knows qhat goes on in his pained mind- not even his family. He could march the Zeybeks to greatness- or to their death.

The Turkish Constitution of 1921

* Article 1: Sovereignty is vested in the nation without condition. The governmental system is based on the principle of self-determination and government by the people.

* Article 2: Executive power and legislative responsibility is exercised by and concentrated in the hands of the Grand National Assembly which is the sole and real representative of the nation.

* Article 3: The Turkish State is governed by the Grand National Assembly *(Büyük Millet Meclisi)* and its government is entitled 'the Government of Grand National Assembly' *(Büyük Millet Meclisi Hükûmeti)*.

* Article 4: The Grand National Assembly is composed of members who are elected by the people of the provinces.

* Article 5: Elections to the Grand National Assembly are held every two years. The duration of membership is limited to two years but re-election of a member is possible. The former assembly remains in office until the new assembly convenes. When holding a new election seems to be impossible the legislative period can be extended by only one year. Each member of the Grand National Assembly is not only a representative of the province by which he is elected but of the whole nation.

* Article 6: The General Assembly of the Grand National Assembly convenes of its own accord on the first day of November.

* Article 7: The basic rights of the application of the ordinances of the sacred law; the promulgation, amendment, and abrogation of all laws; the concluding of treaties and peace; the promulgation of the defence of the fatherland (i.e., the declaration of war) belong to the Grand National Assembly. 

* Article 8: The government of the Grand National Assembly exercises the executive function through ministers who are elected according to its special law. The Grand National Assembly directs the ministers on executive affairs and changes them when necessary.

* Article 9: The Head of the Grand National Assembly who is elected by the General Assembly is the Head of the Grand National Assembly for one electoral period. With this status, he is entitled to sign on behalf of the Assembly and to approve the decisions of the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers elects one member from among its number as the head of the Council of Ministers. However, the Head of the Grand National Assembly is the natural head of the Council of Ministers.

* The frontier between Turkey and Armenia, (starting from the mouth of
the Lower Karasou, the River Arax, the Arpatchai, north to Kekatch, from thence to the valley of Karahan, eastern Teghnis, eastern Great Kemel, Kiziltash, major Aghbaba Mountains) is the limit.

* The Government of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey may be able to consider the wishes of the Armenian Republic about the relocation of the entire native population back into the territories designated in the second article, existing in the old Ottoman boundaries which shall remain to Turkey, by irrefutable historical, ethnic and legalistic rights accepts their return by a general election within those territories, within three years after the ratification of this treaty.

* The Armenian Republic is free to build fortifications and place in them as many heavy artillery pieces as it wishes for the protection of the country against external enemies. In this heavy artillery are 15 cm. shells and 15 cm. long rifles that can be used, and lesser ones used in field armies. No larger guns will be found.

* After the peace the Government of Erevan accepts to permit the Turkish representative or ambassador in Erevan to be free to investigate all these matters at any time. 

* The two parties permit the return of refugees to their hearths across the old boundaries with the exception of those who, during the general war, went to the enemy’s army and took arms, and those who crossed occupied territories and participated in massacres, and mutually assure the privileges of minorities obtained in the most-civilized countries to those who repatriate themselves.

* Those of the refugees mentioned above who do not return to their hearths within the limit of one year after the ratification of this treaty, besides not being able to benefit from the generosity of the said article, their legal claims also will not be heard.

* Despite the great expenses which the Grand Assembly of Turkey incurred for its army during two years because of the urgency of the war it had to wage against Armenia, it renounces its right to demand lawful damages, and in the same manner the two parties forego their rights to ask for damages because of the changes which took place as a result of the general war.

* The Erevan Government declares and considers void and null the Treaty (of Sevres) which was absolutely rejected by the National Grand Assembly of Turkey, and by recalling the delegations who have been tools in the hands of the imperialist countries and their government circles in the purlieus 2of Europe and America, promises its determination to eliminate all kinds of misunderstandings between the two countries; the Republic of Erevan promises to keep away from government circles those pugnacious men who run after imperialist aims and play havoc with the peace of the two nations so that it may give proof of its sincerity for the maintenance of peace and tranquility and the rights of Turkey as a good neighbor.

* The Erevan Government promises not to hinder the free passage of any person or any merchandise belonging to any person on all routes (also of Armenia and Iran), from side to side, by sea and between any country in transit operations. The Armenian government promises not to impede general transit operations of merchandise, carriages, railroad wagons between Azerbaijan, Iran, Georgia and Turkey. 

* The Turkish State will take all railroads and transportation routes in the Erevan Republic under its own control in order to prevent treacherous acts against its integrity and totality by imperialists until complete peace is established and the two parties will forbid the official and unofficial agents of imperialist (Entente) powers from causing any damage or disturbance inside the Republic.

* The government of the National Grand Assembly can take temporary military preventive measures in Armenia against attacks that may threaten its territorial integrity on condition that such measures do not disturb the rights of the Republic of Erevan conceded in this territory.

*  Commercial relations between the two parties will begin and ambassadors and consuls will be exchanged upon the signature of the treaty.

* Regulations for telegraphic, postal, telephone, consular and commercial relations will be established by mixed commissions according to the provisions of this treaty. Meanwhile Turkey will be authorized by the State to resume telegraphic, postal and railroad communications between Armenia and occupied territories as soon as the treaty is signed.

* The Erevan Government accepts all responsibility of past financial ruin of the Sublime Porte and thus takes upon all debt gathered by the government.

*  In accordance with this treaty, concerning Armenia, by the provisions of the special treaty for the evacuation of territories under Turkish occupation and the repatriation and exchange of prisoners, the determination of the frontiers of the Armenian Republic will immediately be put into effect. The civilians and notables held will be delivered. The exchange of prisoners will be effected by a mixed commission.

The larger one will advance west while the smaller one will move north and liberate the coastal town of *Akçakoca* and the surrounding area before moving west along the coast as well. If we are defeated, we ill pull backward into the pass and defend there.

South of that movement, the 4th Corps will also advance to reach the *Yalova* Peninsula, [the site of the massacres by Greek soldiers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWWP/comments/4z5bvm/crisis_events_of_marchapril_1921/). The 4th Corps has been fed propaganda of these atrocities, and ordered to clear out the Greek Barbarians from the area, before establishing a southern defensive line.

The 7th Army will defend Eskişehir from any Greek attacks and establish a defensive line in the province. If there are no major attacks, the 7th army will support the attacks of the 4th and 5th Corps, and help defend their positions should the offensive fail.

The 5th Corps will use the same old tried and true method: advance cautiously and if there's enemies let them come into their land, just harass them a bunch. 

But today we will further use harassing tactics by collecting goat shit from local villagers and ordering our soldiers to spread it all over the ground if a retreat is ordered so when the Greeks advance they get annoyed by all this goat shit and they'll go 'where did all this goat shit come from?"" so hopefully that confuses and annoys them a bit.

The 6th and 7th Corps will continue their same tactics- send out light raids to harass the Italians and dig in to stop any major offensives by Italian troops.

Just like in the north, we will also step up the harassment game. Large signs saying 'Go home Pasta People' will be waved around along with leaflets dropped promising Turkish delight if the Italians abandon the city and their ambitious dream of more Aegean land.

With Violent protests and anti-European sentiment on the rise, Egyptian leaders met today to determine what they should do about the future of the country.

After a few hours of debating whether to leave the empire or remain in, whether to fight for freedom or to ask, whether to maintain friendly relations with Britain or not, the Egyptians have decided.

Their leaders ask for full independence of Egypt, controlled by a constitutional monarchy, along with the ceding of of the Anglo-Sudan to Egypt and control of the Suez Canal.

On the island of Kronstadt, a few sailors have dared take up arms against the Soviet rule! 11,000 of them have fortified the city, hoping that the ice will melt during the Soviet attack, causing their enemies to sink mid assault.

Early in the morning, the assault begins. [50,000 Soviets sprint across the ice](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Kronstadt_attack.JPG) and reach attacking positions, much quicker than their enemy had expected. They have the advantage of surprise now, and hey use that to their full advantage in their first attack, which causes the sailors to take heavy losses.

The soviets attempt to finish the sailors off again, seeing as how the ice will let them. But the sailors manage to hold them off and the Soviets are left on the ice, which begins to show a few cracks...

Not wanting to drown, the Soviets rush the fort in an [all-out assault](http://spartacus-educational.com/00kronstadt1.jpg) and storm the city with ease. They execute the sailors on the walls of the city, preventing another uprising.

In Persia, a weak *Shah* holds power by being propped up by the foreign intervention of Britain and Russia. Normally, this would be called just another day in Persia. But the current young king is so weak that he can barely run what little is required to in the country. 

British and Russian interests are in danger. The country's rich oil reserves are being robbed by local thieves, which is basically the only reason foreign countries care about this place.

In Gilan province, a socialist state with a small force has declared independence and seeks to march on the capital. They seek support from the Soviets.

Nearby, the Persian Cossack Brigade also waits. They also see this as an opportunity to take command of the country, but need outside help. They seek support from the British.

If they attempt to follow us back, we shall use the 'ol 'let 'em in method', allowing them into our land but still harassing their forces as they enter.

In Eskişehir, the 6th infantry will return from the hills and begin to taunt and harass the Greeks inside the city. [If the Greeks attack, the 7th army will move in and catch the Greeks out in the open, using our superior numbers to catch them off guard.](https://s3.postimg.io/dnl3jl6td/j_36_002.jpg) The 6th will also move in to avenge their fallen brothers. Due to the Greek supplies lacking from the liberation of Izmir, we will also allow ourselves to attack more on this weakened Greek army.

Meanwhile the 11th Corps will garrison outside the city and continue to feed extra arms to the revolting Turks.

The 12th Corps in Izmir will cause the most damage. They will steal and destroy any Greek caravans they see to weaken the Greek frontlines. Then they will steal all the Greek planes, and if they can't steal them, they will destroy the Greek airforce parked here ([see page 12 to see that the Greeks have intelligently placed their airforce in a city which they have forgotten to defend.](http://www.ole-nikolajsen.com/TURKISH%20FORCES%202004/indwar.pdf)).

Then the 12th will move south towards Bodrum, leaving Greek supplies here in ruins.

Due to the wars, occupations, and treaties forced on the land, a few groups have decided to take power for themselves and fight for control. They are fed up with the old way and believe that their victory in war is a victory for Romania's future.

And this war has three sides, each almost equally powerful. They are as following:



Name| Description| Power
---|---|----
*Anarchists* | The Anarchists seek to create a an anarchist state- like the Black Army attempted to do but could not. Their militia forces are popular among leftists and workers. They are distrustful of external nations but will receive support if it is offered to them. | 28,000 soldiers
*Republican Forces*| These fighters are in favor of overthrowing what they see to be a weak king and placing power in the hands of the elected officials (which would be themselves for a short while after the war). They seek foreign aid from fellow republics.| 31,000 soldiers
*Monarchists* | This army seeks to restore the old way- well, some of them anyways. This movement is quite divided with some support from absolutist monarchists and some support from constitutional monarchists. The longer the war goes on, the higher chance of this group fracturing. They seek aid from fellow monarchies.  | 34,000 soldiers

There is also the state of Transylvania, who do not have a dog in this fight but only wish to join Hungary, So far, only the anarchists recognize their independence.

Various peasant armies also roam the land to protect their people from being conscripted into yet another war. Will this war be a short Romanian affair? Or will its neighbors seek to intervene for their own benefit?

Once the remnants of the 6th Division has fallen back to the second line, they will fire at the Greeks and taunt them to advance. Meanwhile, marching in from the east is the Seventh Army, who have enough men to engage the exhausted Greeks in a large scale battle on the plains.

If the battle is won, we shall attempt to force the Greek army between both of our forces. If it does not go well, we shall simply slowly pull back, stretching Greek lines even more.

Despite this major loss of land, the Greek's bull-like charge may work to our advantage. In their haste they have forgotten one thing- our people are behind their lines.

The Turkish Revolutionaries have ordered a mass mobilization to meet with the great number of enemy troops. We did not expect so many and wanted to leave some men and women out of this, but now we all shall fight.

The Following Recruitment and Re-Mobilization has been ordered:

---

**[The Ottoman First Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Army_\(Ottoman_Empire\))**

The first army of the major military reform of the nineteenth century, the Ottoman First Army has seen action in most Ottoman Wars since then. Their inspector, [Mustafa Fevzi Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fevzi_%C3%87akmak), is a fierce nationalist and one of the founders of the movement ever since the [Üçler Misâkı](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWWP/comments/4w2n4r/secret_%C3%BC%C3%A7ler_mis%C3%A2k%C4%B1/). He has contacted the army, which is estimated to be anywhere between 120,000 to 160,000.

Once this army has risen for us, they will seize their old weapons and retake Thrace for the Turkish people!

---

[**The Ottoman Third Army**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Army_\(Ottoman_Empire\))

Along with the [*Kuva-yi Inzibatiye*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuva-yi_Inzibatiye), we currently engage these men on the Eastern Front in battle. This will not do- we cannot have Turks fighting against Turks. We will bring forward their commanders- [Yakup Şevki Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakup_%C5%9Eevki_Suba%C5%9F%C4%B1) and [Kâzım Karabekir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A2z%C4%B1m_Karabekir) in attempts to negotiate with this army to stand down and join us. We promise that they shall not be punished for fighting the revolution, for they are Turks like us, who should not turn on eachother. We expect them to be 22,000, according to the [battle map
](http://i.imgur.com/gTJsWCn.png).

Once this army has risen for us, we can expect their assistance in driving out the *Kuva-yi Inzibatiye*.

---

[**The Ottoman Fourth Army**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Army_\(Ottoman_Empire\))

While the Ottoman Fourth Army served in the Jordanian front and contained mostly Arabs, we offer their commander, [Yasin Hilmi Salman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasin_al-Hashimi), a fierce nationalist for his own people, a deal:

[Recruit as many Arabs as you can who remained loyal to this army and meet us on the Eastern front. When we reach the Iraqi border, you may cross and fight for your own people. We will send as many Arab commanders with you as we can and you can fight for your own people. Remember the common enemy- the British!](#secret)

While this army numbered 57,000 near the end of the war and took losses, we expect Yasin Hilmi Salman to bring Arab nationalists as well. 

---

**[The Ottoman Ffith Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Army_\(Ottoman_Empire\))**

This army, known mainly for the [Battle of Çanakkale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Campaign), was once under command of our revolution's leader, Mustafa Kemal Pasha. They now sit on both sides of the Dardanelles, doing nothing. Mustafa Kemal himself will send word to these brave men with the orders to re-mobilize for the Turkish movement.

Once this army has risen for us, they will join up with the Third Army rising in Thrace, This army numbers around 75,000.

---

**[The Ottoman Sixth Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Army_\(Ottoman_Empire\))**

Now reduced to just the [XIII Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XIII_Corps_\(Ottoman_Empire\)), this army sits along the border with French Syria. Their former commander, [Çolak Selâhattin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sel%C3%A2hattin_K%C3%B6seo%C4%9Flu),  a nationalist, will contact them as well.

We hope that this will raise 40,000 to fight for the Eastern Front.

---

[**The Ottoman Seventh Army**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Army_\(Ottoman_Empire\))

Originally created for anti-insurgent activities, this army currently sits in northern Anatolia on the Black Sea Coast. The Greek blockade is clearly visible here, and these men are wondering just what they can do. What's this? Incoming advertisement?

*Hi there, Mustafa Kemal Pasha for the Turkish Nationalist Movement. Are you in a situation where you can see Greek Warships but don't know what to do about it? Do you have weapons handy because there was just a giant war? Are you Turkish? If you answered yes to any of those questions, you may like our exciting new product called:*

*That's right! This exciting new product is sweeping Anatolia at an alarming rate, and you too can also take part! Simply pick up those guns that you have and join up with my forces! It's that easy!*

Wow! What an exciting ad! We can really expect the 80,000 men of the Seventh Army to join up now!

---

**[The Ottoman Eighth Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Army_\(Ottoman_Empire\))**

Like the Ottoman Armies in Thrace and the Dardanelles, the Ottoman Eighth Army sits behind enemy lines.  And it's not like Greece had orders to disarm these guys, since they did not actively resist. Their commander, [Ali Bey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_%C3%87etinkaya), who has already joined up with the movement, contacts these men and asks for their assistance. [Şefik Aker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Eefik_Aker), who may or may not also be in the movement with us, will also recruit these men.

Once this force of 50,000 men rises, they have orders to cause panic on the Greek supply lines then wait for further orders.

---

**[The Expeditionary Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Expeditionary_Force_\(Ottoman_Empire\))**

This force *(helpfully located by wikipedia as the location being somewhere in the Caucasus)* is somewhere. Wherever they are, we shall contact them with a letter from their former commander, [Kâzım Karabekir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A2z%C4%B1m_Karabekir). If they choose to join with us, depending on where they are they shall:

* If they are in Georgia, they shall march toward the Turkish-Armenian border.

* If they are in Azerbaijan, they will attack alongside Azeri forces to hurt Armenia, hopefully knocking them out of the war.

* If they are in Armenia, they will attack Armenians.

Basically if these guys join us, we want them attacking Armenians. They are 20,000 (?) strong.

**[Women](https://s4.postimg.io/p9ffzarrh/image.jpg)**

Considered the 'gentler sex' by many armies around the world, women are refused front-line service. [That is not the case with us Turks, who know a warrior when we see one.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Kara_Fatma_and_her_colleagues.jpg) In the provinces currently controlled by Turkish forces, we will recruit women to serve in our military.

Why is this destruction allowed? Perhaps an earthquake struck all the lands and killed all of its people? Did a flood sweep away all Turks? A famine that made the lands unworkable? Perhaps a combination of all three?

Surprisingly, it was none of the above. It was the same as what is happening now- Invaders claiming the land inhabited by Turks as their own!

Up to the north of them, the 1st Infantry Division, 2nd Infantry Division, and 1st Cavalry Brigade will attack the remnants of the Ottoman Army that has fled to Kurdistan. Because of the high losses of the last time we engaged them, we shall try to force the battle in a valley of hilly area where the enemy's heavy armor and artillery will be ineffective.

Then to the east in the province of Kars, the 6th infantry brigade will move south and use the same strategy as the 8th and 9th regiments. Meanwhil the 3rd Infantry division will dig in and keep a vigilant watch on the Armenian border, where an advance is expected.

On the northern part of the western front, the 14th and 15th Infantry regiments will move in and secure the provinces from the Ottomans.

On the center, the 6th and 7th Infantry divisions will move west to Izmir until/unless resistance is found. If it is found, the units will use hit-and-run tactics on the advancing Greeks and guerrilla warfare. They will not engage in open fields or even attempt to engage in large scale battles with the Greek forces. They are ordered to harass Greek armies, supply lines, and inspire patriotism for the local Turks.

In the south, the 7th and 8th corps along with the 2nd cavalry brigade will harass all those who land on our southern shore. They have similar orders to the central armies- Annoy the enemies to move inland- that is their weakness.

As soon as the Peace of Wilno was called off, Polish forces and their allies rushed into a tired-of-war Romania. Despite the cold, ground was gained by the attacking armies.

Japan
---

The Japanese Navy, eager to bomb the civilians, began their attack on the coast at nighttime, continuing for days. But like the British during the Great War, the Romanians hid from enemy bombings and stayed strong. 

At the end of the bombardment, the town was crumbling, but somehow the Romanian resolve had increased.

Bulgaria
---

Three Bulgarian Armies were ordered to march into Romania. And two did, because one mixed up orders and marched south, then attacked their own people.

The two armies that did move in performed greatly, forcing back the Romanian enemies with fewer losses.

Meanwhile the army that attacked their own people realized what they were doing halfway through, but continued because they didn't want there to be any witnesses. However there were some witnesses, so now the Bulgarian people have heard of their own army killing a town in cold blood.

Romanian Losses: 25k

Bulgarian Losses: 17k


Yugoslavia 
---

The Yugoslavian Army bravely charged into Romania, killing the few that guarded against them, but then failed to advance and encircle the enemy, so they just sat a few miles from their own border and just called it a day.

Romanian Losses: 11k

Yugoslavian Losses: 3k

Poland
---

Poland was very excited about this war. So excited, in fact, that their hands were trembling in excitement and they couldn't aim properly.

The Blue Army failed horribly, but managed to defend against a pathetic counterattack.

The West Ukranian Army didn't have much luck either, despite having such a formidable force.

The Ukranian Army did the best, crushing all resistance and advancing into Moldova.

Polish Losses: 34k

Romanian Losses: 27k

Romania
--- 
The capital has fallen, but the king managed to flee through Hungary, somehow past Czech forces there, and into Austria. He managed to take too secret documents with him as well.

In Transylvania, the Hungarians have revolted against Romanian rule, seeing this as their chance to break free. Romania did not treat this region well.

Also there are rumors of a militant anarcho-capitalist group organizing to seize control of what is left of Romania....

Despite her age, her past injuries, and the cold snow, she stands on the platform like a soldier, proud and patriotic.

She is well recognized because of this, and a crowd begins to gather to hear what she has to say. With a small clearing of the throat, she begins.

""Proud Türk women, as I speak, our husbands, our sons, and our brothers fight where I fought not fourty-two years ago. At the time I had a child on my back and a hatchet in my hand, and I managed to slay several Russians.""

The crowd breaks into cheers. Nene Hatun glares at them, then continues.

""As much as I would love to fight, I cannot. My back aches from age. My hands tremble now in the cold. And my heart has sunken due to the loss of my son in Çanakkale.""

""That is why I call for the women and men of this region to join the movement in my place. Women, show the men that my spirit is in you! Men, support your patriots in battle as if they were me!""

**Navy**


On the Baltic Sea, a much stronger French force met the Latvians, who sailed over in old monitors. The French, quite confident in their ability to sink the enemy fleet, arrogantly sailed right into the line of fire of the Latvian ships and rode circles around the enemy. In this chest-thumping, two French ships crashed into each other and exploded, causing a fiery explosion that damaged a friendly ship.

After that, the battle was taken seriously by the stone-faced French sailors, who sunk half of the Latvian fleet, chased the rest back to port, and blockaded it.

French Losses: two destroyers, one cruiser badly damaged

Latvian losses: five ships, three badly damaged

**Sea Invasion**

After the naval battle, the Estonians clumsily landed in western Latvia. Fortunately, the area was unguarded and the land was easily occupied.

**Battle of Livonia**

On the East, Estonian and Latvian forces clashed fiercely. The Estonians struck quickly and with great vigor, but were unable to break the lines of the Latvians. In their retreat, they dropped several pieces of propaganda for the Latvian soldiers to read. Because of the relatively high rate of literacy among the Latvians, the words of the Estonians were successful, causing many Latvians to desert their former oppressive German overlords who caused them to charge into battle after battle in the name of nobility.

The commander of the patrol pulls out his towel to wipe his sweaty red face. In grabbing it, out falls a picture of his wife and son. He quickly grabs it and clutches it closely, hoping that he will see them once again.

But it appears that this commander and his family will never meet again, for in the bushes wait a Hmong ambush squad, which is rumored to be protected by magical forces.

As soon as the French patrol took another step, the ambush jumps out and begins to fire at the French! A man named Lwv holds a tree trunk like a cannon and fires it at the French, killing them all in one blast. The Hmong cheer and their leader, Pa Chay Vue, emerges at the top of a tree to receive his next military orders.

On the first day, the men began talks for what ideas they had for the revolution. Some were proposing a recreation of the Ottoman Empire under their own rule, others wanted simply a Turkish state in Anatolia. But the man who spoke the greatest was [Mustafa Kemal Paşa](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/ErzurumKongresiGunleri.jpg), and he was elected chairman of the meeting soon after his rousing speech.

Over the next few days, the men debated what kind of state was to be created out of the revolution and how they should go about doing it. Subjects included minority rights, foreign policy, and organization of the army.

During one such meeting, General Kâzım Karabekir, who still had some connection to the Imperial Government, recieved a message from the Sultan himself! All the men rushed over as he read out the orders on the sheet of paper:

&gt;Arrest Mustafa Kemal, for he is a traitor to the Empire and must be brought back to the capital          

Kâzım turned to Mustafa Kemal, who sat beside him. Both men stared at each other for a few tense seconds before both bursting into laughter. Soon the entire hall was laughing at the orders of the powerless Sultan. These moments of comedy helped relieve the stress of running a revolutionary movement.

At the end of the Congress, the revolutionaries decided:

* The Homeland of Anatolia must be protected

* The Revolutionaries are now against anyone who attempts to control the Homeland

* A new government must be formed due to the Imperial Government failing the above decisions

* All Nationalist forces must be consolidated into one in order to become more powerful

Northern Front
---

On the coast of Finland, White and Finnish soldiers were pleased to see the arrival of the Danish Interventionist Army. The Reds were not pleased to see these Vikings, as they failed to advance further into Finland because of them. 

In Ingria the Reds took losses due to a much larger force blocking their path. In Karelia they were more successful, throwing back the Finnish Karelian Army, but reinforcements arrived and they unable to ""push them to Helsinki"" as orders previously stated.

Meanwhile the Reds further east slowly continued their way through the forests.

*Danish losses: 1k*

*White losses: 1k*

*Finnish losses: 8k*

*Soviet Losses: 6k*

Eastern Front
---

On the Eastern Front, the Reds were filled with a sudden and unexplained revolutionary zeal, then attack the Whites, who could not contain them. ""Long live the revolution!"" they cried as their opponents ran miles away from them.

*Soviet Losses: 24k*

*White Losses: 41k*

Southern Front
---

On the Southern Front, the Soviets here seem to have lost their revolutionary spirit while attacking. Witnesses report only one soldier saying ""long live the revolution"" and admitted that he may have been saying it sarcastically during a retreat. The White forces with British assistance smashed the Soviets, causing them to reel backward in defeat.

To the west, the Reds were much more successful, and managed to nearly defeat the Cossack forces. The end is looking closer for the Cossacks.

*White Losses: 6k*

*Red Losses: 14k*

*Cossack Losses: 10k*

Western Front
---

In Ukraine, the Black army continued their destruction of Ukrainian morale by sabotaging and causing panic in their ranks.

But in western Ukraine, a larger battle raged. Soviet forces captured vast swathes of land before meeting the Polish backed forces of Ukraine. While the chances weren't looking too good for the Soviets, the Romanians arrived, destroying supply lines coming in from Poland and the Black Sea. In the chaos, the Red Army managed to capture 19 tanks from the Poles.

*Black Losses: 3k*

*Red Losses: 10k*

*Romanian Losses: 12k*

*Ukrainian Losses: 22k*

*Polish Losses: 5k*


North of that, the Reds once again attempted to hold off against the Polish, who fought their way through their lines with tanks once again, but did not completely take Belarus.

In Lithuania, the Reds withdrew, but not without the loss of an entire army. The Blue Army rushed in with such force that it destroyed an entire Red Army. While the reds retreated, they were under attack from Franco-Latvian forces, but managed to hold their own against those.

*Red Losses: 27k*

*Latvian Losses: 6k*

*French Losses: 1k*

*Polish Losses: 5k*

Also the Estonians didn't do anything, and the Reds just stared at them while they stared back.

Romanian Front
---

A newcomer to the war, the Romanians shocked everyone by advancing far into Ukraine and Polish Ukraine. But they took losses while advancing and then were hit by a Polish invasion from Bulgaria. 

*Romanian Losses: 4k*

*Polish Losses: 3k*


Back at the Home Front
----


Back in the home nations of many countries, civilians are protesting the intervention by their government. *Why is this war needed? We should be having our boys back home, not abroad!*

* Protests arise in Czechoslovakia, but are not too large and only in the major cities. 

* Protests arise in Denmark, in the form of marches by government buildings in Copenhagen, though they are small for now.

* Protests flare up in France across the nation about the costly intervention in the Baltics. The people would much rather that money goes into filling trenches in France with dirt, not filling trenches with men in Russia.

* In Romania, major protests occur in cities and large towns. The people see enemy ships on the coast and fear for another occupation as happened in the Great War. Army recruiters are spat on and even sometimes attacked by angry mobs, who roam the streets calling for the government to end their war!

1. The homeland of the Turkish people is in danger.
2. The capital of the Ottoman Empire has already fallen, showing Ottoman weakness.
3. The Turkish people will be subject to oppression if the land is to be partitioned.
4. Greeks are coming into our land with *gyros*, which are inferior to *döner kebab*.

And therefore:

1. A resistance movement must be created for the protection of the homeland, for the people, and for the *döner kebab*.
2. A new congress at Sivas will be organized, and all fellow nationalists are invited to join.
3. The Sivas Congress must be kept secret until the nationalist movement can be fully formed.

The men finish the circular, pleased with their work. They continue their meeting for several more minutes, discussing plans for the Sivas Congress, then end the meeting and each go their own ways as to avoid suspicion.

*March 2150*

A group of well-respected scientists, professors, tycoons-of-industry, and other heads of the agricultural world were meeting at a week-long conference on the well-guarded campus of UC Davis. Massive spaceships sat waiting in empty fields in case of a nuclear attack, but nobody at the conference expected them to have to be used. Davis wasn't a nuclear target, right?

But they were wrong, for on the final day of the agricultural conference, the nuclear detection machine located in a hidden bunker at Yosemite National Park sent out warnings to all of Central California. Alarms blared throughout campus, causing great panic. 

The guests of the conference were swiftly escorted to the escape ships, followed by desperate students pedaling their hoverbikes. The ships were crammed with people, supplies, and agricultural technology. The doors soon slammed shut, leaving the rest of the Davis residents out exposed to the nuclear threat.

And then they lifted off, never seeing Earth again. Central California was reduced to a few craters, coated with radiation. As the fleet of ships left orbit, some on board wept for their loved ones left behind, others tried to imagine what lay ahead.

*March 2155*

After five years of roaming through space, the fleet finally managed to spot Wolf 630. Low on supplies and morale, the captains decided to land on this warm, marshy planet. And as soon as the ships opened their doors, the survivors immediately set out exploring, planning, and building. For the past five years, they had spent their time debating and deciding what sort of society to build.

And so the marshes were cleared and farmland neatly spread across the face of the planet, designed by the agricultural conference guests, and worked by the former UC Davis students.

**Wolf 630**
---

The planet is artificially divided by a grid system of hexagons. Each hexagon is a district about the size of Connecticut. All of the districts contain farms, but not all farms are the same. Each grows one type of crop that is most suited to the climate of the area. Most of the sugar and coffee districts are scattered around the equator, while most wheat is found north of that. The poles, which contain a fair amount of snow and are rockier than the rest of the planet, are currently used for experimental testing.

Settlements form where three grids meet. Most of the population lives in these settlements, with the exception of the experimenters in the north. High speed transportation takes the farmers to and from the fields each day. The settlements are used for the storage of products, living, and trading.

The people are lively and happy. Sports and competition between districts are very fierce with matches of soccer, horse racing, track &amp; field, wrestling, and polo being the most popular of the sports of Wolf 630.

Planet Surface: [1](http://i.imgur.com/w5VWmZO.jpg), [2](http://i.imgur.com/QtBdsi0.jpg)


**Government**
---

Each district has one main goal: work the fields. All workers are expected to go out and work each day, and in return the district will provide them with meal, clothing, and comfort. Due to this simple goal, there are not many positions of government, but all of these are elected in. Such positions include Head of District Security, Head of District Safety, Head of District Health, Sports Coaches, and other non-powerful titles. Each election is held every year, but not all at the same time.

There is a government above the districts, but does not control the districts directly, except in times of crises such as war or famine. The Head, as it is called, is able to draft farmers into war, divert resources during an emergency, or punish a district for various reasons.

The Head does not stay at one capital, rather it rotates on a convoy quite frequently to check up on each part of the planet.

**Military**
---

There is no standing army, but all workers are required to report to the occasional weapons and defense training. The only permanent part of the military are the officers, who are picked by the Head.

The Agricultors own large amounts of agricultural vehicles, which can be quickly turned into machines of war at a moment's notice. A tractor can become a tank, a hoverbike can swiftly move troops to the battle, and the various experimental weapons of the poles are soon to arrive in the military.

Normally, Moulay would not think about piety, much less think at all, while having sex in the harem wing, but for some odd reason, this thought struck him like a sultan's dick strikes a concubine's vagina.

He held this thought, wanting to explore it more with his mind, but found his current situation too distracting. With a quick shove, the concubine who had previosly been on top of him now found herself on the floor, humiliated. Had she done something to displease the sultan? But she would never find out why the sultan dismissed her so abruptly, for when she managed to come to her senses and tried to crawl towards the sultan, he had already left the room.

---

Now the sultan, fully dressed and cleaned, sat with his ministers and imams, beginning a meeting on the subject of his previous pious thoughts.

""So I was a-fuckin' dis chick while we were on de horse. Some kinky shit, my brothers!""

The sultan laughed and raised his hand for a high five, but was left hanging by his Grand Vizier, who interrupted his sex story.

""Apologies, my sultan, but I thought dhis meeting was on Islam?""

Moulay Ismail's hand remained in the air, now slowly forming into a fist. He suddenly brought it down, slamming the wooden table next to him.

""Interrupt me again and you shall have your tongue removed and buried in de a-Sahara!"" He roared. He was now leaning forward in his chair, his hands tightly gripping the armrests.

But seeing the shock on his cabinet's face made him calm down and compose himself. He leaned back and let go of the armrests, letting his red palms fall to his lap.

""But you are correct, and I thank you for a-that. Islam is de topic of dhis meeting. I have done some thinking, and I wish to take my *hajj* now, while there is a-peace.""

The Minister of Coin, always concered with the state of finance in the kingdom, spoke up.

""My sultan, de *Hajj* is no easy occasion on our treasury. Dis will cost much coin even for a good-sized trip.""

""I don't want a good-sized a-trip."" Tje sultan spat back. ""I want a *Hajj* greater than the one of Mansa Musa.""

Whispers and gasps shot up around the room. The Minister of Coin was speechless, currently trying to think of how to respond to this outrageous request. But the sultan anticipated his opposition, and spoke first.

""We control de lands of Musa through de [*Bashauyat Timbuktu*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashalik_of_Timbuktu). That is de source of a-Mansa Musa's gold, we will take from there. If that is not enough, I am sure you ministers can come up with ways to produce the coin.""

One imam, who had been silent before then, spoke up from the back of the room.

""Sultan, what if they do not give us all the coin we want? What then?""

Moulay Ismail roared with laughter. He shook back and forth in his chair, his palms slapping his knees. The imam uneasily chuckled, hoping that his suggestion was hilarious, not hilariously bad. But unfortunately for the imam, whose body would be found in a ditch not long after the meeting, it was hilariously bad. 

""Not give us coin? Do they know a-who I am? Do you know who I am? I'm a sultan! I take what I want!"" The sultan was screaming now, clearly angry at this imam for doubting him.

He quickly turned his head to face the general, who had as many scarred on his ugly face as he had won battles.

""Prepare the armies. We are going down south to extract coin in preparation for my *Hajj*.""

It is surrounded by massive stone walls which are guarded by the finest members of the Black Guard, the Sultan's elite army. Even the inside is lined with these strong men, as they are seen in every hallway, every bathroom, every kitchen, every bedroom, every courtyard, and every entertainment room, all standing guard. But there is one part of the palace that is not guarded by the Black Guard. And strange as it may seem, this is the most valuable part of the palace, at least to the sultan.

For this area is the *[Zenana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenana)*, or the harem's area. Nearly every whore, daughter, and wife of the sultan live in these fine apartments, guarded by a force of eunuchs. Any non-eunuch to enter this sacred halls without the sultan's permission is punished in the most brutal way. A man who peers into the windows is blinded. A man who touches a woman here has his arms removed. And a man who dares try to make love to a woman here finds himself being eaten by vultures at the top of the Atlas Mountains.

But a man who is entering with the sultan's permission, or the sultan himself, is greeted with a sight he may never forget. For when one first begins to make their way toward the apartments they can hear soft music being played. These[ swell tunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35Mc1HY_bR8) are played by a musical group of eunuchs for the enjoyment of the women. But when a man enters the room, a bit more [upbeat music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rTDD9iK3S0) starts to play in preparation for the more energetic activities that are about to occur.

Then one hears the joyous laughter of naked women as they play on the cool tiled floors of the palace. Dancing, sitting, talking, gossiping, and bathing can cause some bit of noise when it's done by more than a hundred women. But when they hear the sound of the sultan's footsteps coming towards them, they manage to swiftly move into their [most sexual poses](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Jean-auguste-dominique_ingres%2C_il_bagno_turco%2C_1862%2C_04.JPG) they know.

Another such feature one notices when they are nearby the harem is the smell. It can differ greatly depending on the schedule of the sultan. If the sultan has not yet visited the harem that day it smells of sweet fragrances, brought from Europe and the Far East. The skin of the concubines are practically covered in sweet fragrances to enhance the visit of their master. One whiff of these wonderful aromas is like smelling an entire flower field.

But when the sultan has left the harem is entirely a different smell. If one has smelled a sweaty army that has fought for hours in the hottest desert in a drought during the summer, they know the smell of the harem. The floor is drenched in a layer of sweat, for the sultan's sessions can be quite vigorous, for both him and his women.

And now is the time of day when the sultan has decided to head towards the harem. His wives, who are allowed to freely move about the palace and are not confined to the apartments like the rest of the women are, are informed of his actions. While they are not required to be there, their absence would be noted and surely their child may or may not fall out of favor for succession. The last group of courtiers follows the sultan, giving their last words in before he enters the harem wing. And when he walks under the arch and into the wing, the men fall silent and do not follow, for doing so would bring great pain.

Moulay Ismail makes his way into the main courtyard of the wing. He is dressed in fine silks, unlike the woman who wait for him. All eyes in the room turn to him. Some are brown, hailing from the deserts and the seas. Some are blue, they belong to slaves captured from Europe by the sultan's pirates. Some are green, like Luke's Jedi Lightsaber in Episode VI.

A few of the more brave ones approach him to begin undressing him and massaging his tired body. Their soft hands, which are never exposed to their harsh desert air or vicious battle, begin to tear away at his robes. His cape soon falls to the floor, covering the tiles. His shirt is next.

The sultan's own eyes scan the room now. His women wait for him to choose. Sometimes he chooses one while the others dance, sometimes he chooses many. One time he choose all of them. Nine months later, there were lots of babies. The sultan was pretty pissed about that whole ordeal, not because he had lots of screaming babies in his palace, but because he couldn't fuck anyone during that time. In his frustration, he [conquered a few Spanish cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Larache_\(1689\)). He threatened to conquer more, so Spain shipped over hundreds of young virgins for him for fear of him taking more land from them.

One of his [finest whores](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres%2C_La_Grande_Odalisque%2C_1814.jpg) is waiting, clutching a peacock fan to cover her bottom. A jeweled scarf hangs on her head, and when she notices the sultan's stare, she playfully removes it and uses it to cover her breasts, playing hard to get.

But the sultan does not want someone who is playing hard to get, so he moves on.

The next woman he lays his eyes on was an [Irishwoman](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/The_White_Slave.jpg), one of his wife's friends that came over to celebrate the wedding, but found herself with no way back home due to Britain being at war with Morocco at the time. So the new sultana managed to get her an apartment in the palace, which turned out to be great for all three of them. The Sultan had  a great new concubine, his wife had a friend in the court, and the concubine could live free of terrible British rule. When she looked at the sultan, she closed her eyes and blew a puff of smoke from her mouth.

But the sultan wants someone with fresher breath, so he moves on.

Next came [the twins](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/The_Deposed_Favourite.jpg). They both came from Central Spain, born to the same parents on the same day. Despite them being so closely related, they were very different. They often liked to fuck the sultan at the same time, the older one acting cooler toward the sultan, more hard to get, while the younger was the more eager of the two. Usually after sex the sultan would relax with the elder while the younger wept in shame.

But the sultan didn't want to hear any tears today, so he moved on.

Then came the two English whores. Both had been brought to the harem when the sultan stormed Tangiers. They had been left behind by the English after the defenses where blown up, and thus suffered from PTSD due to being close to the explosions. The sultan offered them loads of drugs and pipe to calm their nerves, and they eagerly accepted those, along with his dick. Often times they'd ride the sultan's hard dick while high.

But the sultan didn't want some druggies, so he moved on.

Up next was the [Slav](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Ferdinand_Max_Bredt_-_T%C3%BCrkische_Frauen.jpg). She was one of the most experienced women in the harem, for she had a long history of whoring. She was captured while still a teen, living in Poland. Her village was raided by Swedes, who fancied themselves Vikings. But these 'Vikings' did not fight like such and were defeated by the Russians, who brought the girl back to their camp. But then the Russians were killed by some Turks, who also took the Slav for themselves. They brought the tired girl to their sultan, who liked her so much he decided that she would be his traveling whore. But when the Ottomans were defeated by the Moroccans in battle, the sultan quickly fled, leaving her in Moroccan hands. And so she was finally brought to Meknes, where she whores today.

But the sultan didn't want to wear that pussy out anymore than it already was, so he moves on.

The sultan's trousers fell to the floor now, and now he was fully bare like the women around him. Their hands brushed his skin and their knees fell to the floor, some to bow and worship him, and others to suck his dick, each more eager to suck his old dick than the last. He briefly looked down to see which whore currently sucked his dick, noticed it was a local Berber girl, and then closed his eyes in pleasure, moaning.

Opening his eyes after a few seconds, he continued his scanning of the room. Far off, in the artificial river he had installed last year, [a boat full of women](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Bridgman_Fredick_Arthur_The_Harem_Boats.jpg) rowed by. Each one was from a Barbary State, home of pirates, so it was only natural that they rode around the palace in a boat that sailed in an artificial river. Often times he would climb into the boat, look them all in the eyes, and say *Look at me. Look at me. I'm the captain now.* and then hijack the boat and pretend he was a pirate while they were his captives, only letting them leave the boat when they had pleased him.

But the sultan didn't want to ride around in the boat saying *Look at me. Look at me. I'm the captain now.*, so he moves on.

And now the Sultan meets the eyes of the [daughters](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Daniel_Israel_Haremsdamen_im_Innenhof_eines_Palastes.jpg/800px-Daniel_Israel_Haremsdamen_im_Innenhof_eines_Palastes.jpg) of the *Jumping Jews of Jerusalem*. Like their fathers, they had great skills in going up and down, so they were called the *Bouncing Bitches of Bethlehem* for their ability to ride on his dick at great pace. It was a tragic story of their entry to the harem, actually. Their parents failed to impress the sultan with their jumping skills, so he had their feet chopped off and their daughters pressed into service. But despite this sad tale, the *Bouncing Bitches* were loyal and good at sex, so he kept them.

But the sultan did not want quick sex, for he was tired, so he moved on.

Then he saw the [musical whore](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Ferdinand_Max_Bredt_-_Serenade_im_Harem.jpg). Often times, while having sex, she would play an instrument. When she was blowing the sultan, she played a guitar or drums. While she wasn't blowing him, she blew into a trumpet or a flute. Sometimes while she wasn't involved with sex at all, she just played on the side for whoever the sultan was currently with. And that was quite often, because she wasn't good at sex. 

The sultan wanted to have good sex, not musical sex, so he moved on.

The the sultan looked at the [woman](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Himmel_Harem_1921.jpg) from the land of the Mughals. An exotic woman, she had moved far from home to fuck the sultan. But she memorized the *Kama Sutra*, so she was quite a valuable member of the harem. She knew nearly every single position, and even the ones that didn't exist. For she was also a sex scientist and had her own lab, where she studied the secrets of sex with other scientist women so Morocco would have the most advanced sex in the world.

But the sultan didn't want a woman who was a *fuckin' nerd*, so he moves on.

Then he turned his eyes once more, looking at the [Moor](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Th%C3%A9odore_Chass%C3%A9riau_-_Moorish_Woman_Leaving_the_Bath_in_the_Seraglio.JPG), the [Anglo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/The_Light_of_the_Harem.jpg), the [Gypsy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Oliver_Dennett_Grover03a.jpg), the [Greek](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Renoir_Parisiennes_in_Algerian_Costume_or_Harem.jpg), and [every single woman in the bathhouse](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/La_grande_piscine_de_brousse.jpg), but he realizes that he cannot choose between one for they are all so perfect.

And so, for the second time in the history of the harem, the sultan chooses to fuck them all. Every. Single. One.

Those who stood guard outside the harem that day will report that they heard a great number of moans and groans for the forty eight hours that the sultan stayed in the harem. The sultan was truly the stuff of legends, and he would have many children in a few months time. He puts his clothes back on as the women sat there, exhausted. 

But the sultan was happy and full of energy. He confidently strode out of the harem wing, greeted by a band who played [triumphant music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VGJGXMUhmc&amp;index=16&amp;list=RDrEUnxcoheWI) to celebrate his great fucking skills.

Just another day for Moulay Ismail, sultan of Morocco.

The men were dressed in traditional colorful robes and turbans, which seemed almost alien to the peasants in their dirty rags.

A few times some peasants had reached out to touch these strange foreign men. But the peasants were quickly shoved away by the muscular slaves, who were well trained in crowd control.

The small man gave a nod to the man with the biggest turban, who seemed to be the leader of the group. He shouted orders back at the slave, causing the small man to wince. Then he turned to face the guards once again.

Several barrels of beer bounced around inside cart, but were tied down by well-worn ropes. The monk leading the cart occasionally tugged at the horses pulling it, but otherwise sat there, very, very drunk.

The cart managed to clumsily make its way into town. The monk fell out of his cart, face-down into the dirt with a great *plop*. And the townspeople orderly lined up to the cart and begin to fill their cups with beer and tossed a few coins nearby the holy man's snoring head.

This beer was was popular among many towns across Belgium. The monks were known for both their piety in the Counter-Reformation and the flavor of their brew. Both of which were happily taken in by the peasants.

Albert and Isabella, not normally one to drink such an alcohol, had never been wandering much outside their palace during a time like this. But now that peace had come, the couple managed to find time to ride about in the countryside and happened to be stopping in the village when the monk arrived.

Albert had never seen such a sight before. Peasants? Acting orderly? What was this mysterious drink that made them act as fine as nobles? He dismounted his horse to investigate, and headed over to the cart.

""Excuse, my men, what is it here you're doing to this monk?""

One fat man with a very stained shirt turned to Albert to answer for the group. ""We's jes-a puchasin' this 'ere's man beer. Is migh'eh tasteh ya know!""

*Hmm, this peasant doesn't act like rabble when he's given this drink. I should brew it in my own palace and give it to the soldiers if they ever threaten to mutiny again.*

He flipped a few gold coins toward the monk's head and dropped a small cup into the barrel. He heartily drank up, laughing along with the peasants and ran to bring some of this great drink over to his wife.

On the floor lay a fine Oriental rug and atop it sat a desk and two chairs.

Catherine Michelle sat in one of these (technically she sat on two pillows so she was able to see the desktop), and her teacher in the other opposite of her. On the table sat a few stack of papers and lessons. Today they were learning geography and religion.

""Now, Catherine, where's Hell?"" The teacher asked, motioning towards a diagram with various drawings of Biblical places. But Catherine, still thinking this was a geography lesson, placed a finger on the map that sat next to the diagram.

The teacher laughed. ""Catherine! Amsterdam's not Hell!"" He then stopped to consider this thought, and muttered ""this girl may actually be onto something...""

But while the Jesuit scratched his head and pondered the relation of Amsterdam and Eternal Damnation, Catherine Michelle stared out the window. Albert alwas outside, leading drills with Maurice.

But the Jesuit broke from his thoughts and noticed Catherine not paying attention as well. He coaxed her back to focus with a sweet and continued on with the lesson. After a few more minutes of theology for three year olds, Albert walked in, sweaty and tired from training.

""How goes it?"" He asked the teacher. Catherine watched as they talked and talked, not understanding a word they spoke. Something about her future, a university, and learning, but Catherine paid them no mind and turned back to the military drills once again.

Fortunately before Catherine fell and broke a few bones, Isabella came running out to the garden and peeled the child off of the tree. She was given a good scolding and sent inside, and servants were called over to retrieve the creature from the tree.

*The little apes are clever fellows.* Isabella thought to herself. *I wonder what else they can do.*

She stared up at the tree branches as the monkey hopped from branch to branch to avoid the angry servants and flung cake at their faces if they got too close. She laughed and say down as she watched a new entertainment for the afternoon instead of a concert.

After fifteen more minutes of scrambling, the servants finally managed to secure the Capuchin. They brought the tired chimp down and delivered it to Isabella, who now had an idea and way to make it happen.

""Such a shame the *Capuchins* weren't able to come and spread the true faith. But we will have our faith now."" Isabella told the creature.

The person on the mounted beast was none other than Margret Pole, current Queen of England, after talking the title from the former ruler Henry in a brutal civil war. But what is she doing here, so far from her homeland, and alone? Well, there were some reasons. England was quite a dinky place, and ruling it is a bit of a clockwork job. Do this, do that, sign this or that, enforce something. Normally, Margret would find enjoyment in spending time with her husband Richard, but for over a year he has been resting in Heaven. 

At the same time, the Englishwoman found a pen friend to cheer herself with. It was also a woman, like her, in a ruling position, and also alone and bored. For a few years, they both were chatting through letters of various sort, from standard everyday talk to more... sexual content. Margret was ready to meet her new friend. There was only one problem - she was in Poland.

But this distance did not stop the ambitious and determined queen. She ordered to take a ship from the Royal Navy and sailed to Rotterdam, where she continued to ride forward, through the Dutch territories and Germany. This was not a royal expedition or a diplomatic trip - just a personal meeting.

""At last!"" Margret exclaimed while riding through one of the narrow streets of Cracow. In fact, at last - her journey is coming to an end. The walls and towers of the Wawel Castle have finally shown themselves. This is the royal palace to all Polish kings, built during the rule of Wladyslaw the Great. And now, it was also the destination of a certain English woman...

Margret safely rode over the castle bridge, and reached the main gate. There were no guards outside - it was odd to her. In England, the castles usually had guards standing, who would protect the building in a siege. Maybe Polish defensive traditions are different... Margret jumped off her horse and knocked at the gate. No immediate response, but, after a few minutes, a woman's voice from the other side reached her ears:

""Yes? Who is there?""

""My name is Margret Pole. I am searching for Anna Radziwill - she should be the queen here.""

""Yes, that's me."" Margret moved to the side, and the gate slowly opened, until it hit the snowy ground. There was only one woman inside - with royal clothes and a nice haircut. Yes, that was Anna - Queen of the Commonwealth Between The Seas. Margret, who had already left the horse at the stables, ran up to and hugged her friend.

""Wow, Anna! You look quite a lot cuter than I had imagined!"" The Queen of England exclaimed. In comparison, Margret wa quite a lot taller and more well-fit than Anna, though both still stood strong. ""Say, I'm wondering - you don't have castle guards here in Poland, or what?""

""Oh, you mean those that weren't slaughtered in never-ending wars?"" Anna replied. ""All the way in Scandinavia. My husband is probably freezing his toes in Finland or dead, so I'm quite bored. Aside from a couple of female servants, I'm all alone.""

I have to keep this in mind... Margret thought, then continued:

""Well, at least you actually have a husband. Mine died over a year ago, and all other young men have resisted my advances...""

""Err... do you want to come in for a cup of tea? We just got some from China. It will be a lot warmer inside, too!""

----

""And the he follows me into the chamber, thinking he's going to get it, when I slap him across the face and tell him that he's just working for his country!"" Anna finished and laughed. Margret followed suit, though a bit superficially. ""I mean, sometimes Vassili is just such a jerk! I hope he dies in that Finnish wilderness.""

The English queen sipped the tea from the mug just a bit, then turned to the bookshelf at the side and checked it a bit. They've been talking for hours by now, about pretty much everything. Her vision stumbled across an interesting one. Anna also noticed where her friend was looking.

""Oh, this one is just an old book of old Slavic myths and pantheons. Not that interesting."" Margret still opened the book, just to check it out. After all, when else are you going to learn about...

""Jarilo?""

""You know, this book is quite interesting. The previous king got it from a Persian merchant, though never got around to read it. It describes all kinds of sins and moral mistakes, as well as some mental instabilities."" It was called 'The Method', and the cover depicted a sad old man's face with Hell in the background. Thankfully, it was written in Latin, and probably from the Middle East, so the two women could understand it and what's written. Anna opened it, cleaned off some dust that gathered on the table and started reading it, while Margret examined the Polish queen. Her looks, body build, stature...

I have to say, this woman looks great... Margret thought, while looking at Anna deeply. However, her thoughts were quickly cut short, as she noticed an interesting picture while her friend was traversing the old pages.

""Wait, what was that? On the page before."" Margret spoke, then opened the one in question. At the top was a drawing of a naked woman hugging another, then all kinds of positions, all with descriptions.

""Oh, this? It's a mental problem, when a woman has a lust for another woman. These kinds of things are why I avoid talking with other women - what if one of them is crazed and starts something like this?""

""Very interesting... Do you often read books? Because I could barely read one word before you finished all of it.""

""Yeah, sometimes. When I'm not busy with ruling work, that is.""

""Hmm... You know, I've never seen a Polish bedroom before? Can you show me?""

""Uhh, that's a bit of an odd question, but sure. The castle is pretty big, though - it will take a while to get there.""

----

It was already evening, and the sun was setting. Margret and Anna were in the royal bedroom, checking it out. The double-sized bed was in the center, nicely decorated. A few wardrobes and tables were around, but not that much. The window was already shut.

""So, here it is. There isn't much to see here, and I usually sleep alone."" Anna spoke. Meanwhile, Margret was already eyeing her down, and biting her lip. The stage was already set, now the only thing left to do is to move. While Anna was facing the other way, the English queen walked up to her and brutally backhanded her in the back. The blow was so strong that the Polish queen fell out of balance and fell on her butt.

""What was THAT for?"" Anna exclaimed angrily while standing up.

""Oh, did you not expect that?""

""Oh, so you want to fight, huh? Well, you're going to get it!"" With this battlecry, Anna charged right towards Margret and pushed her on the bed, then furiously attacked her. Of course, the English woman did not stand passively and retaliated. It was a brutal fight - even though both of them were wearing royal linen clothing, it got ripped up in mere moments. It's like these were not women, but rather furious animals seeking to kill each other. But they both were having a hell of a lot of fun, and slowly, though surely, the battling started growing less and less serious.

Finally! After a brutal fight that can only be compared to a war, Margret seemed to have come out on top of the smaller and weaker Anna, and jumped right on top of her stomach. At this point, the Polish woman was pretty much naked, while her opponent's clothing was heavily danaged, and already had most of the skin showing. The English queen went on to grab on to the thing closest - Anna's breasts.

""UGH! Disgusting!"" she shouted out, though quite a lot more friendly andsexually than furiously. With all of her strength, she pushed off the English woman off, sending her falling on her back, then proceeded to jump back on her. ""Unlike you, I have experience at this kind of sin, you Western amateur!"" Anna exclaimed.

""Ooh!"" Margret replied. ""I knew getting you to a bed you be a good idea!""

""You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into, Margret!"" Anna then proceeded to furiously kiss her opponent, French style, while removing the last bits of her undergarments and throwing them away. This was succeeded with the Polish queen moving a bit away, in front of her legs, while still holding them in place, then violently inserted her index and middle finger in Margret's vagina.

""AAH!"" Margret shouted.

""Don't cry, you asked for it."" Anna's fingers pounded the English queen's body rhytmically, but brutally and violently, like the Polish woman was trying to rip the opponent's body in half. Margret put her hand on her mouth to avoid any more screaming, then grabbed Anna's head and tried to shove it in between her legs, trying to make her lick.

And then, suddenly...

""Uhh..."" Both queens immediately stopped and looked at the door. Standing in it was a young Lithuanian magnate, Albertas Goštautas, with some flowers in his hands.

""I... I can leave, if you are busy...""

""Oh, don't be such a downer, Albertas!"" Anna spoke. ""Why not join us instead?""

*Oooh, these damned men of the cloth. Can't stand them!* Jacob angrily thought to himself. *Albert must've ordered him along, thinking we'd be better off with him. We'd be better off without him, he's going to eat our supplies and help with nothing!*

But Jacob managed to compose himself, and headed over to where the portly priest stood. He wiped off his dirty, calloused hands on his pant legs, then brought his right hand forward to shake the holy hand.

""Ah, ye must be dah Cath'lic priest sen' from Rome, eh?"" he asked as his rough hand met a far softer and cleaner one.

""Don' care, jess git on da *[Duyfken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duyfken)* an' we can se' out.""

The priest, obviously insulted with this sailor attitude, scoffed and headed up to the ship. With all of the ship loaded, Jacob decided that now would be as good a time as ever to set off. He grabbed a spare bottle of rum, smashed it on the ground, and then climbed up the plank to his deck. It would be a fine few months at sea.

But the party appeared to be late, and Albert was getting impatient. He decided to head back inside instead if baking under the warm autumn sun. As he entered the palace, he was approached by the conductor of the choir, who asked him if the Jesuits were coming.

""They have not yet arrived, but be sure to play when they do."" Albert ordered. The composer nodded and hurried back off to his choir, who were warming up in preparation for a performance.

Getting even more nervous, Albert approached a grand mirror to fix his clothing and hair. He didn't want to appear disrespectful to his holy guests, of course. He brushed a few strands of hair back into place, then heard the palace's main doors being opened. He turned to the front of the hallway, ready to greet the Jesuits.

Maurice opened his mouth to speak, but another party entered the room. It was the Jesuits, dressed in fine robes and with carts full of Bibles.

Now all three parties stared at each other.

""I weesh to talk to my faif'full flock todaay about zeh zeal. One musht alwaays have..."" The priest paused, letting his heavily-accented words hang in the air. He froze in position, one arm extended and its fist clenched, the other pulles to his chest, his hand clutching a well-worn bible.

The homily leaned forward, as if expecting something out of the priest. His eyes swept the room, he had their full attention. The corners of his lips curled into a smile and he breathed in to deliver his last word with great force.

""Zeal!"" He shouted at last, scaring a few ladies in the front row with the energy in his voice. ""All across zeh Catholeec worl', I am not zeeing much zeal. I want zhis flock to have zeh most zeal God has and will ever witness!""

He once again strared into the crowd, and his eyes met the special couple, Albert and Isabella. Albert gave the priest a small nod, one former church man approving the sermon of another. The priest smiled and continued on, with Albert taking in every word.

---

After the session was concluded, Albert and Isabella strolled out of the church, thanked the priest, and headed out to their gardens for a pleasant Sunday afternoon. They planned to talk and play with Catherine Michelle, but Albert seemed to have other things on his mind.

Isabella, noticing his preoccupied state of mind, sent off Catherine with a maid and then turned to Albert.

""Dear, something on your mind?""

Albert did not respond for a few seconds, only sitting and rubbing his chin. Then as if Isabella had surpsried him somehow, he quickly turned to her and spoke quickly.

""Isabella, I was just thinking about the church today. Zeal. Such a great part of life to have, zeal.""

""What about zeal?""

""I just, I..."" Albert was at a small loss for words. He opened his mouth to speak, but closed it again and simply exhaled a puff of air. ""I just cannot describe it, I must show my zeal somehow. My service and belief in God. I must do my churchly duties.""

Isabella pondered this for a second as well, then spoke. ""Well, perhaps we can show our love for God in some way, can't we? We wield great influence over the church and the the people, surely we can influence them to be more zealous, and we will have done our churchly duties.""

Albert liked this idea. ""You're  a genius, m'love!"" He exclaimed. ""I must get the church leaders to be more zealous, and in turn, the people. I'll get the Holy See's finest men out here!""

Albert rose from his chair, planted a quick kiss on his wife's cheek, then walked briskly toward the palace, ready to begin a zealous counter-reformation.

The wheels of the carriage went over bumps and into puddles, giving Isabella a small headache as she bounced in her seat.

She has finely prepared herself for the journey, having practiced her Dutch with her local servants. *If the boys in the Hague wish to speak about moving furniture, I'm ready.* she thinks to herself. She also had made efforts to prepare her hair, face, and dress as well, hoping to make a fine impression on the men. Her hair was tightly held in a bun, her face was painted white and her cheeks and lips red, and her blue dress was held together with fine stitching and a heavily-jeweled corset.

She had also taken the time to grab the most knowledgeable sailors and cartographers from the ports in order to help her with her presentation. Convincing the meeting of men to hamd over money was not going to be easy, but Isabella had never been one to shy away from hard things, had she?

Eventually the carriage reached a more paved road- they had arrived at the Hague. Isabella pulled back the curtains and peered out the window. The townspeople seemed to be going about their business, letting Isabella give a sigh of relief. She had been worried that someone would notice the scratched-out sign of the Spanish Monarchy, which had been hastily done when the peace was signed. The symbol was well-known and hated by the Calvinists of the north, some of whom wanted Isabella dead as well.

But the carriage made it to the *Staten-Leger* without much trouble. The doors were opened and Isabella stepped out of the carriage and into the hot summer air filled with bugs and light. She began to sweat under the heavy dress, and called for a servant to fan her off. She and her party then entered the building, which was unfortunately no cooler than the outside.

They stepped into the main hall, where the officials waited. Isabella began to notice herself sweating even more and realized she probably looked less presentable than she had hoped, now that her bun collapsed and her dress was drnched in sweat. Still, she had a presentation to give.

""Gentlemen,"" she began in her Spanish-accented Dutch ""I have come in my husband's place to ask for funds for a project. The Lower Provinces have decided that it would be beneficial to all of the Republic if an colonial crew was sent to the New World for the purpose of permanent colonization.""

""I have spoken to any great captains here,"" she turned and pointed toward the seamen, who bowed, ""And they say it can be done. My cartographers,"" and she again pointed to the two cartographers present, who also bowed ""Have prepared a list of possible places to colonize based on past exploration.""

""I come from Spain, and I am no stranger to the New World. My family owns nearly half of it, and they will own all of it if we do not act on its riches ourselves.""

""I am requesting funds to raise and send out a fleet for the purpose of creating a colony. Any other members of this government wishing to join this expedition may also join.""

But today, it does matter for the Hungarians who rules over them. For *""The Tigress of Čachtice""* is in power, and therefore, a danger.

Who is this Tigress? She is Elizabeth Báthory ^[2], widow countess in Transylvania. After her husband died a year ago, the people have become more bold in their accusations. They acuse the countess... *Of Murder!*

[♩ ♩ ♩](https://youtu.be/bW7Op86ox9g)

Elizabeth has been known for running a Girl's School in her lands. Her late husband was well known for providing aid to the local people, so they trusted the famy name. But this trust was misplaced. Many girls who attend this school have gone missing, along with all the maids in the countess's castle.

After the first few disappearances, people thought *eh it's Transylvania, weirder shit has happened.* Bit as more and more reports came, people have started to become suspicious of Elizabeth. Families call her a murderer, a vampire, a monster.

Now the Austrian Rule must respond to this threat, real or imagined, or face a trouble to their rule in the region.

The stables did not have any amount of *neigh* or hay. Training fields were overgrown with weeds and some local children had begun to play ""Calvinist and Catholic"", a local game which involved one group of kids as Catholics simply beating up the other group. Or vice versa, as the rules differed in the other regions. Albert stared out the window, realizing that he needed a hobby, or an army.

Ever since the dismissal of the Army of Flanders, the Hapsburg Domain of Albert and Isabella had been in need of an army. Not a mutinous, expensive one like the Army as Falnders. But a local one, with loyal men not fighting for not gold nor religion, but for pride in their homeland- Wallonia The local Walloons will make ~~great cannon fodder~~ soldiers for the new *Régiment Wallon*.

Albert, deciding that this wet April morning was the day he came back out of his short and disgraceful retirement and took back command of an army. He ordered his officials to begin preparing for a recruitment drive across the land, hoping that a new group of young men willing to be in a standing army would come of it.

And over the next week, recruitment began. Booths were set up in town squares for men to sign themselves ip for the army. Criers were sent out to the villages of the Wallonia, to spread promise if great pay and adventure for those locals wishing to join an army for their fatherland. Knights dueled and Musketmen fired at performances in large town fairs, hoping to gain support from the masses. Prisons were raided to find the least-nasty men of the cells to press into service. And because Albert was in charge of the recruitment (like all things he was in charge of) there *had* to be a Catholic part to it- in the form of priests blessing any man who joined and monks and nuns sewing the flags and banners for the new army.

Eventually, the excitement of the public died down after a week of recruitment, but a no-less-excited Albert was left with sheets of names and numbers, listing how large his army could be. He eagerly sketched out the uniforms for [musketeers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/N6935756_JPEG_1_1DM.jpg), [lancers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/N6935754_JPEG_1_1DM.jpg), and [pikemen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/N6935755_JPEG_1_1DM.jpg). He used up barrels of ink as he wrote the names of new officers and planned new barracks.

But Albert realized he still had a problem. A new army needed new tactics. The old tercio wasn't going to do, as Albert had seen its weakness in his fight against Maurice. Deciding that it wouldn't be such a bad idea, Albert dipped his quill in ink to write one final letter to Maurice, requesting help in planning the tactics of his new army.",empirepowers,[EVENT] Régiment Wallon,https://www.reddit.com/r/empirepowers/comments/4ekerf/event_régiment_wallon/

Its new polish and shine stood out against the old document's roughness and tattered edges, where it had been last touched almost forty years earlier by the diplomats of the Late King Philip II. The document had been stored in the heart of the palace's military quarters since then, sitting right below the army it created. It was the contract for the [Army of Flanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Flanders).

And with an attached page and a few new seals, it was worthless. Worthless as the Army had been in its final years, not fighting but sitting there untouched. Multiple languages were strewn across the contract, as it was in the army. But now the pages were being folded away, just as the army was.

The chief of ceremonies, holding the ancient documents in his small gloved hands, stood up and cleared his throat. All the other generals, officers, diplomats, and officials who had not been paying attention before now turned to face the chief, expecting a grand announcement.

But the chief only had a few words for them: ""It is done. This contract is null and void."" which disappointed some mens' want for a grand speech of what a great time the army had or what the history was behind it. But the chief simply placed the contract into a case, removed his gloves, and walked out of the room, as swiftly and simply as his speech.

Now the conversations began. Some officers praised the simpleness of the ceremony, others insulted the simpleness of the chief's mind. Military officers nervously conversed with each other, hoping they would have work when they got back to Spain. Albert started to leave the room alone until he noticed an old friend, [Ambrogio Spinola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrogio_Spinola,_1st_Marquis_of_the_Balbases).

""Spinola, my old friend, it has been many great years fighting alongside eachother, no?""

But Spinola coldly looked back at Albert, with a hurt look on his face. ""You have betrayed us with this-a contract, m'lawd. I am simply disguh-sted!""

""Surely you do not mean that?"" Albert replied, shocked.

""I do! You have put us out of position. We are generals without an army, used to Spanish service. But where will we go now? Spain? Spain cannot afford us anymore, no, no, we will have to wander Europe like-a some damned mercenaries!""

""Spinola, please! Stay here and command my armies!""

""No! I do not wish for you to be my leader again!""

Spinola hurried past Albert, exiting the palace and hurrying over to the courtyard, where the captains of the Army were now starting to march away.

Albert watched from the gardens, staring at this tired but proud Catholic army. He gave one final salute, which was returned by most of his old men, but not Spinola, who turned away. Now Albert felt hurt. He had let his old army down. Just as he was going to walk off to sulk somewhere, he was approached by one of the junior commanders, [Hendrik van den Bergh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_van_den_Bergh_\(count\)).

""Why so sad, m'lord? Come along, we have a new army to build from my people's men!""

Happiness returned to Albert's face. A new army. Even though this wouldn't be a pure Catholic force, it would be a loyal one.

Isabella was in the middle of having some really great sex with her young lover when she heard the cries of Catherine Michelle coming from the other room. Normally, a servant would deal with crying children, but Isabella had told her servants that she was not to be disturbed- for obvious reasons.

""Sorry, Peter"" she exclaimed, giving him a kiss as she untangled her sweaty and sticky legs from the sheets and grabbed a thin silk robe from the well decorated sitting on top of the nightstand next to the bed. 

Peter rolled his eyes at this distraction which had been ruining his sex for the past few months. He watched a bit jealously as the infant was sucking from the breasts he had been fondling not a short while ago.

Still a young man, Peter thought only of sex and wealth, not family and fatherhood. Isabella's attachment to his daughter (if Catherine even was his daughter, he did not know as Isabella remained silent on the matter and he decided in his mind that he would deny any relation to the young baby) confused and annoyed him. The lovers' age difference was clear, and it was clear that this relationship was just a fling.

Isabella held Catherine in one hand, letting her daughter drink from her breast, and massaged her crotch with the other, as it was sore from a nice prior fucking.

""Peter, that was amazing! Let me just feed Catherine and we can get right back to it.""

Peter sat in the bed, unflattered with this compliment. ""Why can't you just get a servant to do that, Isabella? Then you can feel even more *amazing*.""

Isabella laughed at the silliness of the idea ""Oh Peter, you know that can't happen. Too many loud mouths and peeping eyes in this court.""

Peter laid back, knowing what she said was true but hated how it interfered with his sexual needs. He thought of how he could get Isabella to bed.

*Bribery? No she's richer than him. Begging? No, he had more dignity than that. Blackmail... just might work.*

""If you don't put Catherine aside right now and come fuck me, I'm leaving for Italy."" Peter blurted out.

Isabella turned to look at Peter. An expression of shock was on her face.

""Y-you want to repeat that, dear?"" Isabella asked with a hint of anger in her voice.

But Peter would not back down. ""Put the baby down, and come back to bed. Forget about being a damned mother for once!""

Isabella shot a furious look at him. *Forget about her child? Who Peter think he was, treating her like some whore?* (Although technically she kind of was a whore) She set Catherine back in her crib, then turned back toward the bed, slowly moving toward Peter, rolling up the sleeves of her robe and clenching her fists.

But Peter was not only a sex-crazed young man. He knew when he was in trouble. ""I-I'm sorry, m'love, t'was only a-""

But Peter was unable to finish his sentence, as Isabella tightly gripped his neck. She pulled his face, which was slowly turning the purple color of her robe, to her face, which was already the red color of her hair.

""You tell me to put my Catherine aside ever again..."" She rasped, teeth clenched, anger boiling up inside. ""I will personally see to it that you are whipped, clapped in chains, and eaten alive by the beasts of the Orient. You hear me?""

Peter attempted to nod, but could only manage to choke up a bit of spit and make a sound of a tiny fart.

Then she released him, and he fell back onto the bed, gasping for air like a fish out of water. When he managed to breathe on his own again, he turned to Isabella, who was now fully dressed and holding his own clothes.

""Get your rags on, you lousy painter!"" She commanded as she tossed his clothing at his face. ""Go to your damned Italy! Don't ever talk to me or my daughter ever again!""

Peter quickly gathered his clothes, slipped them onto his sweaty body, and sprinted out of her chambers.

Summer 1604

In celebration for the peace talks, the finest works of art were brought to the Palace. Isabella, being a collector of the arts and a loving mother, brought her daughter with her to see what Italy's finest had to offer.

As each piece was slowly bougt out, shown off, and bought, Catherine eventually fell asleep and was taken back to her own chambers. Bit Isabella stayed until the end, when the finest and most expensive piece was brought out, *The Fall of the Phaeton*.

*I recognize that artist!* Isabella thought to herself. She then asked the gallery master who painted the piece.

""Peter Paul Rubens, m'lady.""

*Of course, it's him* She thought, mildly annoyed at the name of her former lover. But not annoyed to stop herself from saying:

""I'll take it. Hang it in the halls""

As the army slowly makes its way toward the enemy, the song is repeated over and over again, mostly because it's the only song the army knows.

*I can't stand this butchering of my language from these foreigners* Albert thinks to himself as he feels a major headache approaching as the singing enters its third hour. *I have to clear my head!*

With a quick tug of the reins and passing of command, Albert rides his horse away from the army and find a small town to rest at. He heads down a small but well worn path to see what he can find...

But as Albert rides closer to the town of [Poperinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poperinge), he finds no source of comfort or a place to rest. The village is in chaos as the buildings lie in ruins and the people lay dying in the streets. The war has taken its toll here.

Albert slows his steed and lets it trot through town. The injured cry out in pain and the others try their best to comfort the doomed. Albert finds himself looking away as he sees a small child with stumps for hands writhe around on the floor, its dead parents stuffed in a well nearby...

He manages to hold back his emotions as he rides up to the only man who appears to be calm and collected in this Hell-on-Earth. The well dressed man is painting on a large canvas, humming a tune as he works. Albert examines the expression on this artist's face as he comes closer and realizes it is not one of sanity. The artist grins widely from from ear to ear and his eyes do not blink, even as tears fall from them. 

""What is et you're paintin' there, my good sir?"" Albert carefully asks the madman, hoping not to make the scene worse than it already it.

""Oh, jusht a memory."" The painter replies, not taking his eyes off of his work. Albert, getting nothing from this small exchange of words, leads his horse so he can get a view of the piece. 

It is a scene of agony, one only Satan would deliver. It is a scene of soldiers bullying villagers at this very town. It is a scene that leaves Albert even more shocked than before as he sees what barbarians these men of war can be.

He dismounts his horse and sits on a stump, sobbing heavily, hearing only the sound of houses crackling as they burn and villagers scream as they die.

Eventually he manages to get up from his weak state, clear his eyes, and begins to help the villagers. His past church work has prepared him for this: helping those who need help when God has turned a blind eye to them. 

When the dead are buried and the dying are treated, Albert leaves the village, too tired to take credit for his deeds. He sets on back to his army, disgusted at the horrors of war and ready to end them as swiftly as they can. He send the following letter to Maurice, Prince of Orange:

&gt;Dear Maurice

&gt;I apologize, but I must be brief, for I am not in the mood for writing or diplomacy. I saw a great number of tragedies that I did not wish to experience today, and my view on our fight has changed. I wish to end it soon, for I feel I may go mad as these people. Do come to the negotiations when you tire of war as much as I.

Once a mod sees a battle, he will comment that he is ready to mod it, show you the exact location where the battle will be (provided you have mentioned which area or province you are fighting in in your post), tell you the weather, and what commanders may advise.

At the start of the battle, you should know the size of your army based on historical sources. These can be direct sources or the listing in a Wikipedia page of a battle similar to the one you are about to fight. If you don't know your size, ask someone to help you find it. Also, please be aware of what types of units you may have, as these will greatly affect a battle. You should also try to find out any commanders you may have. The more detail, the better.

The submit your battle tactics. All of them. If it's an NPC vs player, don't care where you send them; it can be in comments, the post, IRC, etc. But if it's a player vs player battle, both should be sent via private message to the battle mod. And on the subject of these, include your full strategy. I'll include an example:

&gt;Strategy for the Battle of Limerick

&gt;The O'Brien clan will wait in the forest for the Burke army to approach the city. They will divided into three main groups: **Left**, mainly cavalry and gallowglass, **Right**, mainly Highlander mercenaries, and **Center**, mainly Pikemen. 

&gt;Once the Burkes are within firing range, the archers will fire from the trees three rapid volleys, and then the center and right flanks will begin to charge. They will attempt to meet the enemy at the widest point of the field so our cavalry may have room to maneuver.

&gt; If this charge is successful, the cavalry will attack from the flanks so we may surround the enemy. If it fails, we shall slowly pull back and rely on our archers to cover for us.

&gt; At this point, we shall command our Gallowglass to move to the center, as they are our heaviest units and can stand the most fighting.

&gt; If we win, chase down the enemy to the rivers and stop there. If we lose, retreat into the city and prepare the walls.

This is just a sample of a very small battle. Larger battles will require a lot more strategy. Any parts you left out in your strategy that may occur in the actual battle will be up to the moderator to command your troops in a way your commander may have done IRL.

**Do not** write like this:

&gt; The cavalry will charge and kill the pikemen and once we win that the musketmen will shoot and kill the enemy king and then we win.

Not only is that annoying, it's not even strategy. If I see that I will become angry on the spot and make you lose the battle.

The warm summer air held his clothes tightly to his skin and his unclean and unshaven hair sat on his head like a wet mop. For the past few weeks, the mutiny had gotten more and more violent, and the officers had been forced to flee from house to house that would take them in, until two days ago, when they were cornered by the mad army.

They were forced to lie low under brush and in fallen logs as the army ran through the forest, shooting and stabbing any unsuspecting hunter or villager and hoarding the game for themselves. The officers slept for not two hours at a time each day before they heard the screaming and whooping, hunting them down like animals.

Now the party of noblemen and skilled soldiers sat at the edge of a clearing while Albert examined his surroundings. Nothing moved, save for leaves fluttering in the breeze. Albert squinted and looked for any sign of his hunters, but found nothing in this forest. Deciding the coast was clear, he motioned for his men to follow. They rose as one and begin creeping across the open grass.

*snap*

A twig had been stepped on, but the sound did not come from the officers. It came from the forest. The army was here, looting the trees. The men turned to face one another, then began to madly sprint across the field, hoping to outrun the incoming army. But as Albert neared the edge of the clearing, his heart beating faster than a horse's gallop, a band of soldiers stepped out of the bushes and ran towards him. He stopped and slid across the dirty, then turned back around to escape. But more and more soldiers were running into the clearing, ready to rip the officers to pieces.

The officers were surrounded from all sides now! Albert nervously touched his golden necklace, ready to say his prayers. His heart beat faster than the pace at which his wife rode her lover. He fell to his knees, ready for death. All this time, he had struggled so hard, but now it was clear: be torn to pieces by your own men and accept death.

He closed his eyes, waiting for it to be over with. But he was shocked to hear a familiar pair of voices: Martin and Leon, the negotiators of the mutiny!

""Oi, commandahs! We's ready tah start fightin' again!""

""Yea, we's tire' o' jes' killin' animals! We's ready to fight dem Unite' Provinces again!""

The look on his face was not one of shock, happiness, or relief, but one of *are you kidding me you fucking little shits I deal with your shit for fucking years and you decide to come back because you're bored of stabbing trees? Goddamn I should beat you all to death with tree branches like what the fuck no heaven for you.*

But then he stood and cleared his face, as he suddenly found himself laughing. ""Haha! You are ready to fight?'

""Oi, sire!""

""Then let's go fight! Hurrah!"" He pumped his fist triumphantly. The soldiers and officer followed, cheering that the mutiny was over. The officers now had someone to boss around.

At her funeral on , the coffin was taken to Westminster Abbey on a hearse drawn by four horses hung with black velvet. There was a great amount of sorrow seen in the crowd, as England has not known so great a leader.

Robert Cecil, the head of Elizabeth's government, has been writing secret letters to King James of Scotland for months now, offering to be heir to the Kingdoms of England and Ireland. James occasionally communicated with Elizabeth herself, hoping that she would name him her heir. Before her death, she did, and James of Scotland was named James of England, the Scots, and Ireland.

Now James has arrived in England, where he promises to return to Scotland every three years. The English people seem to accept him as their new monarch, although Scotland now fears that despite James hailing from their lands, they may be treated as the lesser kingdom.

Water droplets fell onto the roof and onto Albert's sword, like the building was crying. Albert himself even felt like crying. His army ran around like madmen while his cities lay under siege. He had tried to restore order to the land and people he loved, but had no success for the past year. His daughter^[1] was growing up without her father while he charged through mud with the few loyalists left and beat his soldiers until they ran to the stockades. 

He was currently at a Flemish barn, which was owned by supporters of the Spanish rule. They offered to let Albert and his commanders stay under their roof as their last camp had been destroyed by the mutineers. The farmer's middle son came out to the stables where Albert sat, clutching a pretzel.

""*zoute krakeling?*"" the young boy offered Albert. But he did not reply, instead staring off at the cattle as they milled about in the fields.

*Oh to be a bull. To mow the grass until my stomachs are full and breed with any cow I want. But noooo, I have to command this damned army.*

The boy looked over to the cattle, expecting something interesting for such a long gaze, then back at Albert. This man was clearly boring and not worth the young child's time. Not wanting to stand in the cold any longer, he left the pretzel on Albert's lap and headed back inside.

After a few minutes, Albert looked down at the salty snack. He picked it up and bit into it, but found it to be tasteless. Disgusted, he threw it to the ground and then decided to doze off in the hay, his mind clouded with thoughts of suicide, anger, depression, family, and hopelessness.

Still, these two men were apparently in charge of the mutiny.

Albert, thinking of his diplomatic skills able to wind the hearts and minds of these two foolish leaders, began to speak. ""Look, this childish, weak act, it's got to stop. I really want this to be a ruse, but the village you're doing is no fun to anyone. No come on, we have a war to fight. What do you want us to give you to return?""

The two soldiers pondered this offer for a moment. Then almost in unison, ""No deal!"" was shouted. Albert was shocked, why would his offer be rejected?

""Gentlemen, I assure you, this is the best offer you'll get!"" Albert cried out

""No! Not enouff rubies!"" responded Martin, who then stood up from his chair, grabbed his pike, and began to smash up the room. ""Loot 'dis place!"" He yelled, getting Leon to jump to his feet and also begin firing his musket at various paintings.

Albert then turned to stare at the messenger. The two locked eyes. One set was filled with great rage. The other with fear. Albert advanced toward the fallen young man, brought his fist back, then shot it forward at the wall next to the messenger.

Isabella let out another scream as her finely-manicured fingernails tightly gripped the blood-stained blankets. Nurses doused her forehead with wet sponges, washing away the sweat with gallons of water. Doctors tried to keep the lady calm by feeding her a wide range of exotic medicines or inviting in distracting singers to ease her mind of the pain. Midwives rushed in and out of the room, supplying the doctors with their tools and occasionally dragging out a weak-willed fainted relative.

I'd like to introduce to all of /r/empirepowers a project the mods have been working on ever since the reset, but didn't manage to finish before the new season began. But now we can finally announce that we are going to implement a new ""pay-to-play"" system.

Before you all freak out, don't worry, the subreddit will still be available to all users for free. However, we are going to just give the paying members a few advantages. Such advantages include:

* *Auto-Winning a battle:* If you don't really like how a battle turned out because it's lost you the war or you simply wanted to crush your opponent even harder, paying members will now be able to type ""**auto-win**"" at the bottom of any [BATTLE] or [WAR] post and have the result be a victory

* *Free colonies:* If you're a landlocked nation in the Holy Roman Empire and still want a new world empire, you can now get one! Paying members will now receive seven free colonial provinces!

* *God-ruler system:* Instead of being inhibited like the mere mortals on the sub who don't have a paying membership, you can now have an invincible ruler with any traits of your choosing. Want to have hundreds of bastards because your king is a fertile God? Go right ahead! Want to have a silver-tongued ruler who is able to vassalize nations twice his size with one simple diplomatic talk? Go right ahead!

* *Have your post modded before others:* If a mod sees a paying member's post, we will head straight to it and mod it instantly. It doesn't matter if a crusade is holding up six nations or the Middle East hasn't been modded in a week. As a paying member, you are our top priority.

* *Ignore /u/rollme:* If this bot doesn't roll in your favor, we will make him roll in your favor! Call out ""**re-roll""** on any roll you don't like and a mod will re-roll it as many times as you want until a favorable outcome is reached.

All seems well for the first two days of marching, but as the Army passes by Oostende, a city held by the Protestants, trouble occurs. A Dutch watchman begins to yell obscenities at the passing army before he is repeatedly stabbed and shot to death.

And the soldiers who killed the man are punished harshly, for the officers wish to show strength and discipline. But this turns out to be a grave mistake.

The whip cracks down on Pedro's back, causing him to scream. His body is covered in welts and his blood slowly slides off his bruised skin and onto the hard ground beneath him.

""Men, and that is why we never attack a single man who poses no threat to us, especially with such force!"" The whipcracker, Pedro's officer, tells the rest of the army.

For Pedro had been lacking discipline, and his officer had hoped to beat it into him after Pedro stabbed the Dutchman seven times with his pike.

""Now, we're going to be seeing some discipline in this army from now on!"" The officer continues. He looks around and is happy with a few nodding heads that face him.

But in the back of the Army, no such nods are nodded. Martin, a pikeman, and Leon, a musketeer, voice their discontent.

""Ai, Leon, you know wha' dis' officer is trying' to say?""

""No, Martin, I have no 'earing because I fire a damn gun all day.""

Martin, either also lacking in hearing or listening skills, continues. ""I think he said he's gonna whip us all!""

""Martin, I still can't 'ear you, you's gonna hafta speak up!""

Martin then raised his voice. ""Them offica's gonna whip us all!""

""What?""

Martin then shouts. ""I said dem offica's gonna whip us all!""

The Army turns to face him and the officer with the whip stops his speech, angered by this disturbance. The soldiers begin to murmur about what is going on.

The officer raises his whip and points it at Martin. ""You there! Come 'ere an' face punishmen'!""

Martin, not wanting to be whipped, begins to scream, ""See, dey's gonna whip us all!""

The soldiers are shocked and angered. *Getting whipped by the officers? No thanks, better riot!* Is probably the thought process in their heads.

Then the soldier begin to attack their officers, some who manage to flee to Brugges, other who are beaten by the soldiers, who gather their weapons to go attack villagers, burn down villages, and steal food, for God knows fucking why.

Only one problem. He couldn't find his knife to open the bottle. Francisco, being a rough sailor, usually opened his wine bottle by stabbing the cork many times with a knife and hoping that too many of the little pieces didn't fall in before he drank.

He set the bottle aside and got up to search for it. Was it under this old tattered book on his desk? No, that's a bible. Francisco tossed it aside and looked in his dresser. A fine gentleman's jacket, a whore's corset, a soiled pair of pants, but no wine.

Suddenly, someone was pounding at the door. *They were coming to steal his wine!* He began to search quickly and more frantically. Under this shipping order? No. Maybe in the drawers? No. Stuffed in this chest? No!

The pounding continued.

Francisco was at a loss for words. He had to make something up so it wouldn't just look like he was some drunkard. He looked at his surroundings. A musket. A coin purse. A love letter. A map of the Netherlands. A hour-glass he had knocked over which told him that he had spent the last minute with his eyes jumping around the room and not yet answered th first mate.

Isabella then rolled her eyes and turned to face the young man, ready to tell him that he was going to be serving in the army of Flanders.

But as she tried to speak, she found herself tongue-tied by the young man's handsome features. Instead of giving the man a punishment, she gave him an order, and an unusual one.

""Come to my chambers, and paint me like one of those French girls. I'll be waiting..."" And then Isabella rose from her seat and gave the young man a wink before heading inside.

The painter then stood alone under the umbrella for a few moments. *Shit, I can't paint a woman, I'm a landscapes painter not a portraits!* He thought to himself. *Better try my best*

But the man in the doorway paid them no mind. Once the trumpet was lowered, he brought the scroll to eye level, partially to read it, partially to prevent the couple any more embarrassment and begin to read it aloud in a strong, low voice.

A maid swept away the glass while another wiped down the floors, and a few servants helped the terrified poor woman to her feet.

""What frightens, you, m'lady?"" the head servant asked.

But Isabella was at a loss for words. She could only point a trembling finger forward. The group followed her gaze- and stared straight at a great elephant, which calmly sat in the hallway. Its tough grey skin was cracked, its large eyes roaming about the fine decorations, and its trunk wagged back and forth.

Albert laughed and squeezed his wife close. ""Ah, not to worry, m'love. They're putting on a show for us. I'm told it's the only musical performance to ever include such a beast.""

Isabella wanted to talk, but simply stood there, shocked by the elephant. Albert managed to drag her to her chair and stop her gasping.

""Calm down, dearest, they're about to start."" He said, placing his hands on top of hers to prevent her from hiding behind them.

And then six men climbed atop the elephants, were handed their instruments, and began to play under the direction of [Cornelis Verdonck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelis_Verdonck).

Albert looked among the dead, and some included villagers which had tried to flee when the battle first began. He then stopped at a small child, his mud covered boots next to its blood covered chest.

He was shocked at what the war was doing to these people, murdering both Protestants and Catholics alike even when they did not resist the soldiers. He then turned his gaze over to what remained of the village, where the child had come from. A tattered Spanish flag sat in a mound of ashes, a dead horse sat on its rider's spilled guts, and a hundred dead soldiers from each side remained motionless.

*This was, this war.* Albert thought angrily. *Something must be done to help these people, for they are all Christians, some better than others.* He felt his necklace, a golden cross which he had received on his wedding day and not removed since. *I must help this Christian flock in any way I can.*

After leaving the battlefield in disgust, he returned to the [University of Leuven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_University_of_Leuven), and called for the professors to present their finest students to him, for he had a mission for them:

Do not fret over whether the suffering peoples are Catholics or Protestants, for they will become more faithful Catholics or question their Protestant faith when they are given our aid. If a Protestant soldier is in disagreement with your actions, simply leave, for the people will see how they want them to be treated, and dislike Protestant rule.

Moaned Albert, suffering from an old battle wound. A few months earlier, a pike had gone straight into his leg, resulting in a nasty injury.

He attempted to rise from the bed and walk on his own, but Isabella swiflty rose from her chair to stop him.

""Oh no you don't, Albert!"" She exclaimed as he nearly set his bad leg to the ground, which would've caused more pain. But Albert was not thinking straight, as the court doctor had given him a strange plant imported from the Northern provinces, dulling his thoughts and his pain.

Isabella tucked him back as Albert was muttering something about a large bowl of Italian noodles. She pulled the hair out of her face, and sat back in the chair, exhausted. 

*There's no way I'll make it to the fair today.* She thought. *Such a shame, always nice to watch the locals*

But then an idea came to her. She stood up and summoned the court painter, Jan Brueghel, a local talent who was known for his skill after touring Europe and learning the finest art styles.

""Mister Jan, please go out and paint the fair. I won't make it today but I'd still like to experience it. Make it so fine I feel like I'm there."" She the governess instructed the painter.

""At your command, m'lady"" Jan replied as he hurried off go the fair, paints and canvas in hand.

A few weeks passed. Then Jan presented the painting to Isabella after a luncheon.

""Are you pleased with it, m'lady?"" Jan asked.

""Oh, it's quite splendid!"" Isabella gasped in excitement. ""You've outdone yourself once again!""

And so the new painting was hung on the walls of the palace.

The building was a strong, sturdy castle of light stone, coated a light layer of slushy snow that was melting under the new sun. Spring was coming, a new season.

Isabella, his wife of thirty-three years, stepped outside and joined him at looking upon the gardens. Her red hair was tied up, her face full of makeup, and a smile full of energy. Her husband looked the opposite, defeated and tired from his campaign fighting the Heretical Northern provinces.

""What troubles you, my dear?"" Isabella asked her husband, placing a hand on his shoulder. He looked at her over his shoulder but then stared forward, back to the growing gardens.

""This war, it is not favorable to my health. Every day a new bruise, headache, cut, or illness. I find myself only staring at the gardens for less time than I would like.""

Isabella turned her head followed his gaze. Down below, a mess of green plants sat under a layer of frost, preventing their growth. It was an ugly garden for one who had spent long months at the palace, but not for a man who had only seen war in that time.

""Well,"" Isabella began, trying to think of a way to please her husband. ""Maybe I can hire a few of the best painters and they can paint the gardens in great glory, so that their art may be enjoyed all across the land whenever you wish to gaze upon it.""

Albert perked up and gazed at his quick-thinking wife. Bug she wasn't done with the promised yet.

""And maybe in a year we'll have a child to watch as it plays in the garden"" she said soflty, cocking an eyebrow.

Albert smiled, the grey shade from the constant war almost gone from his face. Perhaps life wasn't so bad after all...

Now while we are following a path of alternate history, we do try to follow some history. We'd like players to at least be somewhat informed on their nation and know what that nation's goals and actions were historically.

The poor man tried to struggle and resist, he kicked out in order to have his boots caught in the cobblestone of the street and slow down the guards, but the two men continued to drag him through the muddy main road and toward the palace.

Swans and Puffins wandered through the streets.  

The gates then opened and the man was dragged inside. Guards swung swords above their heads as birds attempted to dive in and rest on the shoulder of their master, some fired warning shots with a blast of gunpowder, but the birds crowded around the castle now, nearby Ailfrid Hichcoileach.

Ailfrid Hichcoileach hobbled over to the window, flung open the curtains, letting a few birds in. Cócó drew his sword to force them out, but then Ailfrid Hichcoileach made an ungodly screech sound, stopping the constant squeaks of the birds.

Approximately half an hour later, the young bards in training had lined up in front of Cócó and his Master of Spies. Cócó then began to brief them on their mission: They were not only to roam the countryside playing for the Irish people, but also to report on English army movements and infiltrate their camp if possible as a bard-for-hire. They were to report back any English secrets, and look for any possible ways to sabotage the English army.

The nervous bards were given a few day's training by the Master himself, provided with notebooks that appeared to be music to the untrained eye, but allowed them to record army patterns, sizes, weaknesses, and strengths. And if their mission were to go really wrong, they were given a jar of poison if they so wanted to avoid torture. And if it went really right and they were accepted into the English army, they were taught to play really depressing songs so the English would not fight well in battle

Then the bards set out, to the Pale, the North, and to any areas under control of English or Norman lords or Irish loyal to them.

Umar Shaikh Mirza II, a great warrior king, led his forces to victory at the battle of Kabul after being betrayed by his brother, who was originally allied with Umar. After seeing Umar's power grow, his allies turned on him and attempted to remove him from the picture, which only resulted in an even more powerful Umar. Currently the Mughals are in possession of a powerful force, ready to invade India. 

*Sunni Warlord (former Safavid faction)*

After being raided by Khorasan bandits, the Sunni warlords responded violently, occupying the villages of the raiders as well as taking back the lands of Tabrestan from the raiders. They promised to return the land, but so far that promise is yet to be fulfilled. Currently the warlords remain at war with the Shia Warlords of Persia.

*Afghans*

After seeing his people mistreated and his villages raided by constant warfare, Ayub Ghazi led all willing men ready to defend their homelands in the Afghanistan region. Ayub's men were feared, and trekking into Afghanistan meant death for the invading armies, so the land was left alone. Currently, Afghanistan is unwelcoming to many travelers and strangers, with Ayub on the thrown seeking to rid his lands of any opponents that dare enter.

*Khorasan*

This once great faction is now reduced to a small bit of land, mostly insignificant. Their leaders attempted daring and bold battles during the war, only to have almost every neighbor wish them dead because of it. Currently, they hold the land simply because of truces set in place to protect them, but will face threat of invasion in the future.

*Khiva*

The local Khans by the Caspian Sea, claiming descendant to Genghis Khan and betrayed the weak Timurids. They began rapidly expanding, but were only stopped by the might of Sunni Safavid Warlords and Bukhara. Currently they control the powerful lands by the Caspian Sea.

*Bukhara*

This faction seems to have won the civil war, but was unable to stop the breakaway states. They managed to reclaim some amount of Timurid land, but now remain a very weakened landlocked Khanate. Currently, they remain a strong power in Central Asia.

Richard looked around, partially blinded from the light, and partially due to the confusion of being released.

Later that night, a few trusted men prepared to set out to the lands under the rule of Kidlare and Ormond. They were informed of their mission, and carried the proper supplies for it. They left the O'Brien castle, rode on horseback for a short while, then dismounted and moved on foot for the last half mile, under the night sky.

The hired agents quietly sneaked through the long green grass, moving toward the barns and fields of the local farmers. When two men on horseback rode past, searching for highway bandits, the agents stopped, ducked into a bush, then waited for them to pass. When the hoofs were unheard, the group rose from the bushes and moved in.

The agents silently climbed over wooden fences, then split off into two groups, one heading to the barn, the other spreading around the field. And each pulled a few jars from their bags, then began to spread the contents around. Each jar had a different material, but they were similar in effect. For each was a different type of laxative.

The laxatives were spread all over the fields where the cattle grazed. They were spread in troughs were the pigs ate. They were thrown in the hay that the horses ate. And they were thrown in the granaries where the grain was stored.

And when each jar was emptied, the agents silently crept out of the field, into the dark night. The jars were thrown into the Shannon river, fully emptied of their contents. They then set back to Limerick to report their success.

It spun around the sun at great speed (which its inhabitants did not know), but was doomed to be on the same collision course as the incoming asteroid.

As it entered the atmosphere, parts began to melt and fly off, but this asteroid was too big to be destroyed by the heat of entering the atmosphere. It was about a mile wide, and its entrance and the tail were seen by people in the Middle East, North Africa, and all around Europe, as it flew towards its target:

**Poland**

At the current time in Poland, many were asleep, with only a mouse squeaking around for some great cheese or a guard keeping an eye out for thieves and other scoundrels. But as the light from the incoming asteroid illuminated the sky, the occupants of Krakow stepped outside to see what in God's name was waking them up at this time. But as they looked into the sky, all they could see was a great fireball headed down right for them.

And for the final seconds of their lives, the citizens panicked. Children cried and the weak screamed. The clergy prayed desperate prays for entrance into Heaven. Some held on to their loved ones for comfort. Some foolish men and women tried to run away. Some took these final moments alive to begin looting shops. And other could only stare in shock, knowing they were going to die.

Then this chaos ended, not with a whimper but with a bang. A *very* loud bang.

Krakow disappeared off of the face of the Earth, and a crater was left in its place. All those in the immediate vicinity of the impact were killed by toppling buildings, flying chunks of Earth, and dust clouds which choked many to death.

New sheets of paper were carried in by the basketful by teams of men, then the words were placed on paper with the swift work of the pressers of print. Pages were then tied and bound into fine little leather books by little old Irish ladies sitting in another room. From there, the books were given to messengers, who rode back and forth from Limerick to all across Ireland.

The books were distributed to all Irishmen, both of free rule and under the oppressive English boots. And inside the pages contained proud Celtic mythology, tales of past Irish kings, but most notably, Irish pride material, describing their constant fighting with the Vikings, Normans, and English, and how they continue to survive each encounter again and again, each time becoming a stronger people.

The point of these publishing is to stir up Irish pride to defend the true Irish king, those that proven themselves worthy of holding royal sites, such as Ri buiden Cócó O'Brien of Tuadhmhumhain, descendant of Brian Boru, the greatest king in Irish history. It calls upon free Irish to continue to resist the English (hinting at volunteering or moving to Limerick to serve Cócó), rise up against any English masters they have, and the Gaelicized Normans to accept their new Irish heritage, and join the Irish side of the struggle.

He was questioned about his new wife, he was questioned about his battles, he was questioned on how well he knew O'Brien history. For a whole hour, he was questioned by every single member of the *roydammna* on almost everything possible. He was ready to melt down and die.

The men met at the cliffs near the Shannon Estuary, fully decked in ceremonial armor. The swords were dulled, but the blows would sting less than the honor loss for the loser of the battle. Cócó O'Brien, a young man of 15, prayed, then unsheathed his sword. Cíoch O'Dea gave a great roar, then unsheathed his as well. The two men walked to each other, the younger much smaller, in height and weight, than his elder kinsmen.

Their families and septs watched from the sides. The eyes were on them.

Cíoch O'Dea swung first, lunging at Cócó with great speed, unusual for an older man. Cócó managed to sidestep out of the way and attempted to stab Cíoch's side, but his blade was knocked away. Cíoch then tried again, swinging madly at Cócó. The lad blocked every blow, then tried to go on the offensive again, bringing his sword high into the air to crack down on the helmet of the old man, but his swing was blocked with such force it set him tumbling backward.

Cíoch ran forward and delivered at great strike to Cócó's chest. He fell backward, wheezing for air. Cíoch then laughed to move in and crush his opponent, but Cócó was up again in an instant, blocking his opponent's strikes.

After a few more blocked strikes, Cíoch was gasping for air, unfit for such a battle. Cócó saw this, and then delivered a flurry of saber slashes, knocking away the tired old man's blocks and managing to strike his chest and face many times.

Cíoch laid on the ground, shocked and bleeding. Cócó laughed and stood above him. Then he yelled to the crowd.

""Those who stand with this man, make yerself presen'! Those who oppose me family, stan' ferwerd! Those who resis' me clan, no, our clan, brin' yerself to me sigh'!""

No man dared to move an inch. Cíoch's wife silently wepaed as she saw her weak husband groaning on the ground.

Then Cócó moved back to his fallen kinsman. ""Sorry, mate. But it's a *Chuid déanta ag an teaghlach*. We are once again the Dál gCais."" 

Cócó was feeling confident. Too confident. He spit on Cíoch's armor, then stood up and strode away. Cíoch growled. He would *not* be humiliated by the boy. He jumped to his wobbly feet then rushed toward Cócó with great speed and range. He saw Cócó with his back turned to him and an open cliff nearby.

Cócó heard the armor rushing toward him. He hopped out of the way, dodging the charging beast. Cíoch attempted to stop, but it was too late. He tripped and fell, down, down, down, then smashed down on the jagged rocks below the cliff. The families screamed and rushed over to the edge of the cliff, peering over the edge to see the bloody remains of Cíoch O'Dea, crushed in his shiny suit of armor against a slab of granite. His widow was taken away, screaming.

Cócó O'Brien looked down at the bloody pulp of his old opponent. Then he walked away, sheathed his own sword, and went back inside to work out the fine details of the *Chuid déanta ag an teaghlach*.

*A fight, it must be a fight!* He thought to himself as threw his sheets to the side and jumped out of bed, running across the cold, dark floor to get a good view out of the window.

To Cócó's disappointment, there was no fight. The sounds of men yelling were the builders, craftsmen, and architects at work, dropping logs down in the square and hammering a few in. Cócó was quite angry that he had awoken for no fight, and demanded to know why these men where constructing such a contraption so early in the morning.

""Oi, mates, it's da wee hours a da mornin' an' I'm awaken' by da sound o' yer work, what the fock?"" Cócó screamed from his room.

""Well if it's gonna protect us, we will work through the day, not da mornin' then!""

Cócó tunred back to his room, then flung the door open, running through the halls and entering his family's rooms. He ripped the sheets from the unused beds and began tying it together to form a giant shade cover for the workers, then proudly marched outside to hang it over the men, thus stopping their sunburns and his disturbed mornings.

There had been constant drilling lately, and not many battles had gone on without the elder O'Briens present. Sure, there had been a few bandit raids here and there, but nothing was exciting like a good ol' battle.

The silence was broken when Cócó O'Brien burst into the halls. He panted, sweat covering his brow. The soldier looked at this welcome distraction, but he held his hand up to show that he needed a minute to catch his breath. After a few moments of nothing but heavy panting, he spoke.

""The...McGeoghegans..(pant)..they're..they're...(pant)...we need...to..(pant)...attack."" He finally spit out.

The soldiers looked around. They could listen to the sweaty dirty grandson of their king, or they could sit around all day and wait for the next drill. In a quick movement, the men rose to action and charged to their gear, nearly sweeping Cócó O'Brien aside with their speed.

The maps were pulled out, and the commanders located the best paths to swiftly ride upon and crush the enemy. The horses were geared up, and the weapons sharpened. Cócó O'Brien stared a bit surprised at what his noble voice could get him.

The men were soon riding north towards the enemy. Cócó sat confidently upon his horse, until he was asked why the McGeoghegans deserved to be crushed by the O'Briens.

""Oh, 'cause they're raidin' the O'Molloys a course! Their land's undah threat, so we oughta help 'em out!"" He responded.

""Hold it!"" the commander yelled out, stopping the march. Cócó looked up to see why the commander would stop the march. His ear was grabbed by the man's rough hands and pulled inwards, causing him to cry out.

""Deirdre? Who's Deirdre?""

""It's...it's..."" Cócó stammered, realizing he had told the commander, a man he didn't want knowing his own loves, about Deirdre, a girl he had met a few weeks ago and had since fallen for. 

""Deirdre's an O'Molloy girl I met a few weeks ago an'...an'..""

The commander roared with laughter, and released Cócó's ear. He slapped the boy on the back and continued to hoot with laughter.

""A girl?"" He giggled, wiping his tears away. ""Oh-hoo-hoo, I know jess' the feelin', young man. Met me true love 'bout same age as ye, an' I'd do anythin' for her at the time. Didn't have an' army at me command, but ye' do."" He continued to laugh for a bit longer.

Today the Brehons (Celtic judges), Clerics, and Rís of various ruling degree decided to meet in Limerick today to update these laws.

The legal authorities and rulers' duties today are to sort through various laws passed by the Statutes of Kilkenny, Brehonic law, and other older Irish legal text to standardize and update the laws of the Kingdom of Thomond. As well as these legal documents, Tadhg an Chomhaid has left noted for the reformers to follow in passing laws.

The meeting went on for several hours, but finally a new set of laws were drafted.

1.  Agnatic-Cognatic Tanistry is to be the basis of succession in O'Brien lands. Females may be considered for the position of Tanist, but this is highly unlikely unless she has proven herself better than men in all ways.

1. Men and Women shall continue to hold property separately upon marriage. The change to this law is that the children shall be granted to the richer of the two upon divorce, not just the father as before.

1. Women shall be allowed to act as witness, their words no longer seen in any way as ""biased or dishonest"".

1. Kings can now no longer be blemished (maimed, crippled, or disabled, although minor injuries do not count) or unmarried.

1. Kings are now able to give judgement at any time, not just during time of emergency or consultation with a Brehon. The king's word is just.

1. To counter this law, kings may now be arrested like any other individual, he is not above the law. If a king is found guilty, his title is to be revoked and his heir will take his place. He will also never be able to be Tanist in his lifetime.

1. Kings do not have a set schedule, unlike stated by *Críth Gablach*. They do as they please.

1. The Irish order of Status has been disrupted by Norman and Latin law. The new law determines honor as the rule of status. Honor belongs to kings, rulers, warriors, churchmen, and legal authorities. Other classes have honor, just not as much.

1. Punishment shall be given in terms of honor. If a man with high honor commits a crime, he shall be given a stricter punishment than one with lower honor.

1. Following the ways of the Gallican church, the king now longer bends knee to the bishop. It is the bishop who bends his knee to the king, unless the matter be of prayer or indulgence sales.

1. No man born on the island of Ireland shall be a slave at any point in his life.

1. The king may grant to freedom to any slave which he chooses.

1. The law applying to freedom of slaves from Ireland may also be applied to any slaves from lands of the king's allies.

1. The Tanist, even if not a land-holder, is granted the same honor and rights as the underkings.

1. Poets of good quality are not in the highest class of honor, but still retain high honor. Poets of poor quality may be beaten or fined if their poetry is heard.

1. Craftsmen, while doing manual labor, are of higher honor than an unskilled manual laborer.

1. Change in status is available. If one has higher honor than their class above them, their descendants are of that class upon their death.

1. The above law also applies for dropping class level as well.

1. Wounding or afflicting harm upon another man is punishable in legal fines as well as payment to the victim's families. In addition, if the victim is the head of their family, they shall be compensated for working days missed.

1. Wounding a man of higher status is a honor loss as well as fine and harsh punishment.

1. If a man is found to be mentally unfit for society and damaging to the village, the village shall assist their family in caring and restraining the unfit.

1. Punishment of death is the last resort for all crimes. Should a murder occur, the murderer shall pay extra fines to the village, court, and victim's family as well as face harsh punishment.

1. If the murder is kin-slaying, the murderer shall receive death.

1. The head of the family, *cenn fine*, is responsible for all crimes of his family if the individual commiting the crime is unable to pay for damages.

1. The process of Gavelkind is hereby forbidden.

1. Legitimate children have more honor inherited from the parent than illegitimate children.

1. A brehon and neutral observers must observe over any court manner.

1. Sturties must recieve proper training and be approved by brehons before acting.

1. Sturties failing to perform their legal duties face loss of honor.

1. Polygyny is completely forbidden

1. Marriage of two different honor classes results in both partners becoming the higher partner's honor class.

1. Brehons must be literate in secular, church, and traditional Celtic laws and history before being approved.

1. Rape of a lower class, even from king to slave, unless the slave has been prepared for that purpose, is not allowed.

1. Monasteries are under protection of the pope and the local kings.

1. Kins contain any child descending from a man of the kin. 

1. Orphans of unknown fathers may be adopted and become kin.

1. Heretics may not be arrested unless they spread heresy.

1. The king, elder men of his clan, and legal authorities may change or alter laws when a legal council is created to do so.

Instead we ask for only a few words. There is much talk on a papal bull issued by Pope Adrian IV in 1155, the *[Laudabiliter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudabiliter)*. This document, which had been unheard of until the Norman invasions, commanded the Normans to invade Ireland to enforce reforms upon government and church.

It was so boring now that his father and kinsmen were gone, off fighting in some crusade. The castle had become boring, as he could only play with the babies or annoy the wet-nurses and the ladies-in-waiting.

He pondered on what to do. Prank a priest? Nah. Steal some sweets? Nah. Pretend to be a crusader since it was likely one would never happen again due to the whole history of crusades being failures and they were rarely called due to the growing differences of the church and state? That didn't sound too bad.

And off Cócó went, pretending to be a crusader. He broke off a tree branch and swung his new sword around, striking down imaginary enemy after imaginary enemy. He advanced further into the holy lands, liberating christian after christian from the heretics and infidels. Just up ahead was the Holy Grail! Cócó jumped over a fallen log, hacked down vines, and sprinted up the hill to grab what was actually a very shiny rock. But his path was suddenly blocked by a very, very large man.

""Oi, kid! Ye can't play en me family's land. Yer an O'Brien boy? Well us Neylans aren't to pleased with yer family on account'a them surroundin' our own lands! Be gone wicha!"" The man yelled at the little crusader. 

Cócó tried to explain that the Holy Grail was just waiting for him to grab it, for the crusade to end in victory, but the man would have none of it. He grabbed Cócó by the collar and marched him back to Limerick. 

""Now if I see ya in me lands again, I'm to 'ave a word with ya mothah!"" The man said and walked away. Cócó brushed himself off, pouted for a few minutes, then ran back to the castle. He had a plan to get the Holy Grail after all.

----

Standing atop a box, Cócó positioned himself in the middle of the barracks. Then, he gave a speech like he had never given in his thirteen years alive.

""Soldiers of the O'Brien clan! Us men have been left behind while the others march against the Turks. Does that not make ye any madder than before?""

Cócó noticed the soldiers nodding and paying attention to what he had to say. A small group of them were surrounding his box.

""Are we lesser soldiers than them? Do we need to prove ourselves in some way to those bullies?""

The crowd of soldiers grew larger, in size and interest.

""Well I have found just the way to prove ourselves! For no good reason, the Neylan clan to the West has foun' reasons to be hostile to our clan! This cannot stand at all! We mus' march upon them and own their lands for ourselves!""

The troops cheered and continued to nod. But in the back stood on one skeptic.

""Don't ya think it's kinda strange our armies are being led by children an' women and whatnot?"" He asked his partner.

""Well we've never lost, 'ave we?"" His partner replied.

""Well, I think there's a first time for everything.""

""Oh me god, Connor, shut up! Look, we's grabbin' our weapons! Looks like we're goin' to crush them Neylans!""

---

150 Light infantry, 100 crossbowmen, 100 Heavy Cavalry, and 25 rams follow Cócó, supervised by his nanny, to crush the Neylans. The plan is to surround their lands, use the crossbowmen to fire upon their forifications, ram down any walls they may have, and charge with the Heavy cavalry and light infantry. Due to the Neylans being a minuscule clan [\(As seen on the map, they are surrounded by the grey-blue and west of the McNamaras\)](http://i.imgur.com/afIlmma.jpg) and surrounded by the O'Briens, this should result in the capture of the shiny rock and a new playground for Cócó.

Rough storms had thrown it through the waves, injuring a few soldiers. The captains, fearing for their mens' lives, decided to stop in the city of Cork to fetch a local doctor.

As the ships closed in on the port, they were stopped by the dockworkers. 

""Woah, matey! Where you be coming from? I've not seen such a flag in me life!"" Yelled the head of the docks, flipping through a book of heraldry and banners. ""Can I ask where ye be from?""

The captain, tired of hearing the dying screams of his men, yelled back ""We're from Asturias, a new kingdom fashioned from Castille and-""

""I know what Asturias is, I jess nev'r seen its flag before."" The head replied. He eyed the flags as they waved on the masts, scribbled a drawing in his book, then looked back to the captain. ""Sorry, can't let ya in the city. Nowhere's gonna let ya in, there's a quarantine on Mediterranean lands an' such on account 'a da plague.""

""Oh no, mate, you listen here! You got some men dying, I do not care! Sail back into the sea and you and your men can all die!""

""You fockin wot, mate?""

""You wanna focking bash?""

Ní Fear, tired of hearing the men yell, rolled her green eyes. She kissed her son, Mairnéalach, on the forehead, then set him down on her bed. She stormed to the top of the deck, then jumped up next to the captain, and also yelled at the head.

""I do wanna fockin bash, mate! I wanna fockin bash this whole town if ya don't let us in. We got dying men and a baby who needs a nice nap!"" She yelled down.

The head turned angry. He did not like it when women stepped out of place. ""Now listen here, you wicked bitch. I don't know about you Iberians, but here in Cork, women do not yell at a man! You speak one more fockin word tah me and I'll cut your tongue out!""

Ní Fear's head spun. She boiled with rage. Letting loose an blood-curdling scream, she unsheathed the captain's sword, flung herself over the deck, and landed on the head's face. He fell to the floor, Ní Fear on top of him. She raised the sword, then proceeded to stab the man in his chest more than a dozen times.

The dockworkers froze. Their boss had just been murdered by some filthy foreign woman. And being the proud Corkonians the were, they wren't going to stand for that! The men rushed forward, raising their tools and knives above their heads to attack Ní Fear with.

The soldiers aboard the ships saw the charge of the dockworkers, then raised their own weapons. Shots rang out as the men unloaded their firearms, preventing the mob from reaching Ní Fear.

She saluted the men proudly, as they were her comrades for the past few months. They saluted back, as she was the bravest warrior of them all. But this celebration was quick lived, as the Cork city guards were seen marching to the docks. 

The captain slid down with a few of his men. ""We're going tah steal medicine for da men, ye in?"" Ní Fear nodded and was handed her own firearm, a gold-plated arquebus from King Rafael. Cannons aboard the ship swiveled to face the guards and fired, knocking a few columns down. The army of Ní Fear rushed forward, prepared to sack and loot the town, like Vikings of the old time.

Inside were tons of new muskets, waiting to be constructed, loaded, and fired. Buachaill gasped excitedly, and the knife trembled in his now shaking hands.

He rushed to another crate, tearing at the packaging and throwing open the box. Inside was a slightly used Spanish culverin, only slightly scratched and poorly cleaned from its last use. Buachaill jumped and yelped, excited at his new success.

Buachaill then was confused. *Wait, I never paid for these. How did they get here?* He shrugged, and would take credit for it anyway. Picking up a musket from the crate, he rushed to the barracks to get volunteers to test out the new weaponry, yelling and screaming about what greatness had come to Ireland.

Hundreds of soldiers clamored about in the field, with the captains reading off instructions for the guns and how to load and fire them. Buachaill stood proudly, watching as the troops were preparing the fire their first shot into the estuary.

""Readeh!"" The captain called out.

The men raised their muskets, and the cannons prepared to light their fuses

""Aim!""

The sights were brought to eye level. The cannons- *wait, was that a Genoese boat out passing by in the estuary?*

""Hold yer fire!"" the captain yelled out, clearly less excited than he was before. One soldier, however, jumped up. ""Wait, uh, sir! That Genoese boat out there, can't it be carryin' the plague?""

The captain stared down the soldier. ""What plague? You daft?""

Another captain spoke up ""He tells the truth, Taisteal! I've heard such a thing as well. We shouldn't have any foreign ships in Ireland.""

The head captain looked at the soldier, who smiled weakly. He looked at his fellow officer, who stood by his words. Then he looked at the Genoese ship, passing by. Its sailors waved happily, its sails flew proudly in the breeze, and it was moving out of sight.

The captain suddenly jumped ""Well we can't allow it to dock! Stop the ship! Fire!""

The men fumbled for their new weapons, and the cannons clumsily swiveled to aim at the ship. Shots rang out and cannons boomed, but fortunately for the Genoese, nobody was hit. The angry captain stepped out.

""What is the meaning of-a this shooting? I was-a just-a eating my pasta and a lead ball hits my-a plate!"" His Italian accent rang out.

Buachaill spoke up. ""Sorry, friend. But we've heard on good authority that the plague's been spreading. We can't take any chances, letting in foreign ships. You're going to have to turn around.""

The captain turned back to his ship, mumbling insults. The ship slowly made a turn, and headed back out to sea.

crown. The fancy parchment paper and fine ink on it was supposed to
belong to his father, but the man had just tossed aside the letter
like it was a scrap of trash, drunk and unhazed by its importance.

Dia Spéir picked up the letter, reading over it quickly. He had heard
of the war in Iberia, but had was not aware that mercenaries from
Ireland were being called. The letter was asking for thousands of men
to assist the Castillian king, Rafael. Dia Spéir was a not a man yet,
but wanted to prove himself as one in order to win the title of
Tanist.

Still, he had conflicting thoughts about it. Letting his father be
Tanist would allow him to be king on his grandfather's death. Then Dia
himself would have a greather chance at being king on his own father's
death. But the again, he could just be king and forget his father, He
had not told him about the Tanistry being up for grabs.

munching away. He was going to talk to his father about this tanistry
business.

He entered the room, and immediately smelled alcohol. His father was
drunk, again. *God, this man's in no shape to be king I should be the
Tanist not him* And with those treasonous thoughts in mind, Dia set
out to be the next Tanist.

written signature of his father, authorizing the army to be sent to
Castille. And just as easy as it was for Dia to steal the army from
his father, it was stolen from him.

Dia saw her coming ""No! No! Stop, it's mine!"" He shrieked. Before he could open his mouth again, Ní Fear delivered a kick to his jaw.

""Sorry, boy, but these army orders are mine now."" She calmly replied, opening the paper up. ""Ooh a civil war needs some help huh? I've always wanted to leave Ireland! And with my own army to command as well, this'll be fun!""

But this particular morning, he and his cows had a few uninvited guests roaming around in the field. Crann was leading his two cousins, Cócó and Amadán, through the herd. A few mooed quite loudly, but luckily for the boys, the Mac Gormáin man could not hear the noise they were creating from his spot by the house.

""Crann! We're going to be spotted, you know we're not suppose' to be 'ere!"" Cócó, a boy of ten years whispered to his elder cousin. He was excited about the Tanistry business and everything, but he didn't want to get into any trouble over it.

Tarraing Mo Coileach was easily identified by his position smack in the middle of it all. Like most fights in Southern Ireland, this one was started by Tarraing Mo Coileach and it would end with him walking out, sometimes bloody and bruised, sometimes not.

The fight was ending, as the army was moving into the square to arrest the rowdiest of them. Tarraing Mo Coileach kicked a drunk brawler off of himself, then sprinted into the nearby alley. Panting, he jumped behind a bucket of fish. Another figure sprinted into the alley and slid next to him.

Both stared at each other, gasping for air while their breaths reeked of alcohol. Tarraing's ear was bleeding, spilling a liquid as red as his hair onto his shirt.

He walked into the stables, greeted by smells of fresh hay and dung. He sloppily fed his mare and neglected to brush her hair before throwing a saddle over her and climbing up. Buachaill Láider wasn't a poor rider, he was just distracted by his thoughts.

Exiting the stable with an unhappy horse and a blank mind, he tried to think what his own father had done while king before he died at the great age of fifty. It mostly consisted of clan politics, small skirmishes with other lords, nothing too significant. He tried to think of the current king's path to become Tanist and what he had done to earn his title.

Buachaill Láider thought harder and harder, trying to remember his childhood. He had been five when his father died and hadn't paid any attention to politics at that time.

""Ye like that, ye wee Irish dolt? Come a bit closer and I'll aim this gun righ' a' ye nose!"" The rough Norman voice yelled out.

Buachaill Láider held his hands in the air, showing he meant no harm. His thinking had gotten him into a heap of trouble, getting a gun fired above his head was no way to start the day.

*These rotten Normans and their rotten guns. Who needs them?* Buachaill Láider angrily thought to himself. *Wait, we do. O'Briens need these big firearms if we're going to survive!*

The Tanist is chosen by the *roydammna*, other males of the house, as who they decide is the most kingly among the family.

For the Kingdom of Thomond, and the O'Brien clan along with it, the current Tanist is Tadhg an Chomhaid's eldest son, Aghaidh Lem. He is a noisy, bearded man of great height and weight. Known for his strength years ago, he now sits in the palace, impatiently waiting for his father to die. The *roydammna* are disappointed with Aghaidh Lem, as well as his father for not having another suitable heir.

Tadhg an Chomhaid Ó Briain is nervous, he knows that he shall not live for many years more, as his hair had turned a pale white and his teeth were starting to rot. His ears hurt from the loud noises of the palace. His bones hurt more than they used to. So just a few days after his 61st birthday, he calls his nephews, sons, and grandsons, with the exception of Aghaidh Lem, to his side.

""I'm getting old, my kinsmen. And the days drag on more and more, and Aghaidh Lem just sits there, loafing around. That is not what a true king does. I want you to prove yourselves to me.""

""Yeah? And why do we need to do just that?"" The nephew Tarraing mo Coileach interrupts. Tarraing was known for his fiery temper and hair, he was identified in the town by his red hair and presence in brawls.

""Because, my nephew, *roydammna* are unhappy. And when the *roydammna* are unhappy, I am to do something about. Some of these men where the ones who elected me king when my brother fell and died. And I want you to prove yourselves not only to me, but the *roydammna* as well. Prove that you can be the most kingly of your kin. I am sure that the *roydammna* will notice.""

The men and boys look around at eachother. They had a shot at becoming a ruler, at giving orders to their kin. They were excited, Tadhg an Chomhaid could see it in their eyes as he looked in their freckled faces.

Tarraing interrupted again. ""Just how do we prove ourselves to be the most kingly, then? Strut around in fur clothes and stuff our faces with cheeses like Aghaidh Lem?""

The other roared with laughter. Tadhg raised his hands to stop the painful noise, then spoke again.

""Becoming Tanist is no easy task. You must prove that you can defend the kingdom, expand our domain, worship god properly, and have your name be known throughout the lands. I was chosen to be Tanist when the *roydammna* saw my skills with a sword and kindness toward my fellow kin. Now, go. Off. Get out and prove yourself kingly.""

Munster-

The island of Ireland is divided into many small kingdoms with tribal chiefs and former Norman raiders ruling the lands. Most of Ireland's public records were destroyed by Vikings during constant raids, so not much is known compared to other western nations of the time. The island is believed to have a population of about 1.2 million to 1.4 million, a good amount which live in the south, Munster.

Munster is a fair land, with a mint recently constructed in Limerick, noble English families located in Cork, Domhnall Mac Gormáin being the richest livestock owner in all of the isles, and Waterford being the second greatest city on the island, after Dublin.

But this land is not without its share of trouble. Since the 12th century, the kindom has been divided into the kingdoms of Thormond, in the west, and ruled by Tadhg an Chomhaid Ó Briain, and Desmond, in the East, ruled by the MacCarthy family. Desmond is collapsing however, and Thormond is the dominant kingdom in the area, taking over the last remains of the rival kingdom during this time.

The kingdom is populated by Catholic followers, save for a few pagans and witches in the rural areas, and the people are Irish, Norman, and English, but all follow Gaelic traditions with Norman influences. The ruler is determined by Tanistry, a system of passing down titles to the most worthy family member, not the first born or eldest man in the family.",empirepowers,"[CLAIM] Declaim Mamluks, Claim Munster",https://www.reddit.com/r/empirepowers/comments/3y9aul/claim_declaim_mamluks_claim_munster/

""Horrible, m'lord. Simply ghastly. Our Sunni brethren have no leader, they are pitted to fight by the Jew and the heretic."" His minister said to him.

Qaitbay frowned. ""Surely we have one man in the fight? One general with legitimate claim to the kingdom, and not just the Jewish vizer and the heretic general?""

Another minister spoke up. ""Well, m'lord. The sultan to the north of Granada is a legitimate candidate to the throne as his kingdom was once of the Moroccan realm.""

Qaitbay smiled. It made him happy when Sunnis were ruled by Sunnis. It actually made him happy when anyone was ruled by Sunnis, but the Sunni-Sunni ruling order was good as well.

Many debates have broke out into brawls and the occasional stabbing. Two sides have clearly formed, a pro-caliphate one and an anti-caliphate one., with disagreements on the legitimacy of the caliph. Each side sits in their corners, glaring at the other side. Guards have been hired for each side to protect each faction's leader.

""Now, the pro-caliphate side has come up with a solution for the crisis. They have pre-composed another letter to the caliph of the west, the sultan of Mali, and the caliph of the east, the sultan of Ottomans. Perhaps the arrival of their forces will convince both the sultan and the anti-caliphate faction that there is legitimacy in the caliphate."" Said Kareem al-Wan, an imam known in the meetings for staying out of both factions, instead listening intently to the arguments of both.

The anti-caliphate side, after much more debate, finally agreed. A letter would be sent to both caliphs to receive fighting forces and a call of Jihad to boost the fighting ability of the men.

Diq Suqer, the head imam of the pro-caliphate faction, is so confident that the plan would work that he offers to deliver the letter himself. Too confident perhaps, as Diq Suqer has no skills besides public speech and Qur'an interpretation. The ride to Mali across the Sahara would be a hard one, and it would be miracle if he even made it back alive.

The other letter to the Ottoman empire would be sent on a fast sailing ship directly to Constantinople. It would have to avoid hostile Christian ships and storms to reach the Sultan's palace in time.

Imams from the cities, Imams, from the Atlas Mountains, Imams from the deserts. They had been each been summoned by an Urgent message: السلطان هو زنديق *(The Sultan is a heretic)*. Such a message was not to be treated lightly, and each imam raced to the meeting to investigate this message as either mere slander or heretical crisis.

""The sultan himself defied the will of the caliph, speaking of him negatively when he deserved no such words"" said Diq Suqer,[ the imam who first saw evidence of Suq Madiq's heresy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/empirepowers/comments/3lir0s/event_celebrations_of_the_battle_of_imzouren/) ""The sultan is clearly a heretic and should immediately be ousted from his position. A new pro-caliphate sultan should be installed in his place.""

Shock filled the room. Was such talk not treason? But treason was surely necessary to combat heresy? Questions filled each man's head until another imam, by the name of Kareem al-Wan, sitting in the front of the mosque spoke up. ""Perhaps Suq Madiq was exhausted from battle and not in a fit mental state at the time? Let us not jump to rash conclusions here, my man!"" Nods and murmurs was the reaction of the crowd, maybe they were accelerating into this conclusion all too quickly.

Another imam, Ahmed Mahi, put in his voice: ""Exhaustion or no exhaustion, it should be basic instinct to not put down the caliph in any way."" Such thought was met with nods of approval from the other holy men, as they followed the caliph's authority in every way.

An young imam by the name Hasan sat in the back of the room. It was time to shake things up a bit in this stuffy meeting. He stood and shouted ""Are we to blindly follow every word and move of the caliph? Has the caliph any power out here in Morocco? Just a few years ago the caliph reduced his own authority by granting the Sultan of Mali the title of 'Caliph of the West'. I, for one, question the entire authority of the caliph.

Hasan sat down. Silence was the only reaction of the crowd. Then came the shouts that what he was saying was heretical along with the Sultan. Then came the shouts that hushed the other ones and said that they agreed with him. Then came more shouts, and finally, a few punches. Just as the battlefields of Morocco, the imams' meeting had turned violent.

Inside the local fort, Sultan Suq Madiq is discussing the next move with his top men. A fierce debate rages, but it is decided that the status of both forces must be determined before anything is set into motion. The men are about to be dismissed when a voice pipes up.

""If nothing else, we are blessed that Allah gave us victory in the battle. We should once again request that the caliph call jihad, surely he will accept this time."" An imam (who didn't actually help with the battle but just shouted ""Allah Akbar"" from a distance) in the corner of the room says.

The sultan stops. ""Jihad? We don't need a jihad. This battle was not won by the caliph and Allah! It was won with the men and Allah!"" The sultan yells. He had grown tired with the Ottomans as of late, breaking promises and ignoring his requests. ""In fact, if I hear one more man speak of the caliph, he will be stripped of his rank! Is that clear?""

Before any of the shocked men can respond, the sultan throws open the door and leaves the room in disgust. The imam is surprised; to talk poorly of the caliph was heretical, had the famed scholar Al-Qurtubi not said ""The caliphate is the pillar upon which other pillars rest""? The imam hurried out of the room. He would have to talk with the other religious leaders about the Sultan's words.

Inside a dinky tavern by the ports of Algiers, Captain Jaq and Piri Reis get drunk with their crews. The music and yells of the patrons are loud, the lighting is dim, and the air is heavy with the scent of alcohol. The crew order drink after drink of the devil’s nectar, becoming more inebriated as the night goes on. Their drunken thoughts are slurred out into the open alongside hiccups and burps. Tonight’s topic is the Princess of Naples, Julia.

“I’d dock my ship in that port, if you know... [hic] what I mean” says a drunken Captain Jaq. The crew laughs heartily and cheers ring out.

“Ah, you’d p-plunder [hic] that w-wonder?” laughs Piri, going along with Jaq’s game. The crew laughs even louder now, pounding the table with their mugs.

“All-ll...ll I know is...is ...is [hic], she’d better get her walls ready for my cannon fire!” roars Captain Jaq. The entire bar howls with laughter now, clearly enjoying the comedic dialogue in front of them now.

“Hey, hey, [hic], hey.. what if we stole the pretty bride? I [hic] hear she’s getting married to some stuffy king and I’m feeling p-pretty sore about not being invited.” Piri suggests, his face showing that he is only half-serious and lacking judgement due to his drunken state.

The tavern is silent now. Filled with amatuer pirates and ambitious young men waiting to become thieves of the sea, none of them had even considered kidnapping a European noble before. All eyes are on Piri. Then they switch to Jaq, waiting to see his reaction.

Jaq smiles. He can sense the eyes on him, the tension in the room. He opens his mouth, then pauses, waiting for suspense to build. Jaq loved giving a show, and was going to give his crew one right now. Instead of speaking, he raises a mug high in the air. The eyes go to his mug, then back to him, expectantly.

“Raise yer mugs, men” Jaq announces. All glasses, pitchers, cups, and mugs are raised into the air simultaneously. “Drink for strength and courage, because we’re going a-princess-snatching.”

The crews bursts into cheer. The music starts up again, louder and faster. The mugs are raised to lips and the alcohol consumed. Jaq watches the scene in triumph, amazed that a few simple word has motivated his crew. It was going to be a long night preparing, and a weeklong journey to arrive at the wedding on time.

He has been interrogated many times, and so far there have been no breakthroughs.

Outside the fort, a hooded figure rides up to the guards and presents a scrap of paper. He is authorized to enter, and is led to the prison escorted by guards. He is Sinan, the court Jew of Tlemcen.

Light floods Humaydi's cell. He is blinded for a moment, then opens his weak eyes to see a scrawny bald man walking towards him. He is grabbed by the neck and lifted into the air. 

""Not talking? We have a fighter here?"" the bald man rasps, his words painfully sliding into Humaydi's ears like venom entering a victim. ""Of course we have a fighter, you're not talking. That's... why they call me.""

Humaydi prepares to spit in this new man's face, as he has done to all guards before, but this one in different. With a flick of a finger, he has changed his hand's position on the neck to leave Humaydi choking and drooling out the saliva he would have used to spit.

All of the other Tlemceni merchants could not keep up with his shrewd business practices. After the Christians invaded, his business was seized and his stock burnt.
