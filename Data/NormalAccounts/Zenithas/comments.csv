1,"Playing tea party, little one keeps passing me ""cake"".  I dutifully eat each piece she passes me.

""It was poison.  You died.""  Oh, okay then.

She then proceeded to ""chop me up"", mix my chopped parts with some spice in a pot, and then serve the resulting stew to her mother.

Edit: We have a lot of these, figured that'd be the one you guys would get the most kick out of, but we have quite the morbid little girl.",2016-09-22 13:36:17+00:00,d7xetjf,1,t3_53y94q,12567,AskReddit

4,"&gt; ethics in games journalism is only one facet of the conversation

Neutral here.  What are the other facets, if I may ask?",2016-05-07 23:59:43+00:00,d2ww1is,1,t3_4ic1e3,5562,KotakuInAction
5,"Clearly, the various levels of detail and effort for the relationships varies by producer &amp; developer.  CK2 for example gives you the option of having a gay or lesbian lover if your character is LGBT on birth, which amounts to a different character portrait on your screen in a small window.  Dragon Age went all-out with fully plotted video 'sex' scenes.

It's also important to remember that LGBT perspectives are often lost in games where gender or romance are completely background for gameplay, which skews results about prominence of LGBT characters.

Mass Effect.  Obvious choice #1.  Femshep/Liara, Maleshep/Steve were romance options through the series (1 &amp; 3).  Both Liara and Steve had well-developed characters (even if Liara was a bit of a wallflower), and Steve's mourning of his husband is pretty heartbreaking.

Dragon Age.  Yet another obvious character development, with both gay and lesbian choices throughout the series.  Not only that, but when homophobes had a go about the gay romance option, it was predominantly gamers who came to it's defense, pointing out that it was an option if you didn't want to see it, and that it was well written.

Crusader Kings II.  They treat it as a birth factor, allow gay or lesbian rulers to take lovers.  They reflect the social issues they suffered during the times, as well.

Fallout 4.  There's male and female romance options for both genders, though personally I find it distasteful that a fresh widow/widower would fall in love within weeks of their trauma.

Jade Empire.  Another Bioware title, it's possible for a female hero to flirt up a storm with the princess, though they leave any romance ending open to interpretation.

The Sims.  If this isn't too obvious, they let your sim flirt up with anyone.  Want a lesbian couple?  Bi?  Gay?  A love triangle?  Done, says EA.

Skyrim.  They give you a chance for romance right off the bat, and Bethesda saved themselves time and increased options by letting the player romance pretty much whomever they wanted, and even adopt a kid in Hearthstone.  In previous Elder Scrolls series games (Morrowind, Oblivion), the players were the driving force towards this, with mods being made repeatedly to allow marriage - and once again, the gamers were happy to include gay and lesbian love.

Catherine.  Erica is trans, which is hinted at from time to time in dialogue.  She ends up in a relationship with Tony, and there's dialogue around the place to show the way her friends feel &amp; react to her.

Fable.  Your character could take a husband instead of a wife, and this theme was kept throughout the series, even once you could play a female character.

Mount &amp; Blade: Warband.  Though marriage isn't on the table for LGBT characters, it's entirely possible for your female character to sleep with prostitutes in Viking Conquest.

Guild Wars 2.  The Sylvari have a very loose definition of gender, and a major plot development is driven by a conflict between two former lesbian lovers.

Star Wars: the Old Republic.  Throughout the series (Knights of the Old Republic, the MMO) there have been LGBT romance options, with Bioware accepting the need for such in their latest expansion for the MMO, and an option to start said romance off fresh if you happened to be locked into a 'straight' relationship before.

I'll be the first to admit that in games which offer romance or identity options, developers are slow to craft LGBT options for dialogue, but the players tend to be the driving force towards them doing so.  Certainly, the above options are pretty popular.",2016-04-08 02:30:31+00:00,d1ufsh5,1,t3_4dua5e,3237,KotakuInAction
6,"1) That thanks to abuse on my side of the family, I have severe anger issues, misogynistic tendencies, and trust issues that I am working out.  Thanks to abuse on her mother's side of the family, her mother has severe anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies.

Not that these things happened; the scope.  She doesn't need to know that her mother was thrown through a glass door, or that her grandmother my side tried to kill my siblings and myself one day.  She just needs to know that there's a good reason we keep minimal, if any, contact with relatives that other people enjoy.

2) That when said daughter was born, one of her grandmothers went on a drug-fueled rant about how terrible she (newborn child) is, bad enough that she had police called on her for several lines of commentary about murder and suicide.

3) That one line of our families has been pretty heavily involved in crime in the past, something we've worked to escape.  Another line of our families has basically closed off because I'm a child out of wedlock.  She doesn't need to know how shitty people can be, at least, not until she's older.",2015-10-15 08:56:31+00:00,cw0gf1c,1,t3_3oltx2,144374,AskReddit

8,"White male here, never would have considered that to be offensive before reading through here.

My normal context perspective would have interpreted that as ""I don't consider you in racial terms"", which to me sounds like a good thing.  Not often slapped in the face by privilege.

9,"Worked in security and got pretty far in unarmed security 'cause of my height (6'), weight (220lb), and 'broken-nose mean' look.  People find larger men intimidating, especially coupled with a deeper voice.

But couple in a racial difference, and you get people *scared*.  Aboriginal or immigrated 'black' guards couldn't get posted at many public contracts because the managers had seen how clients would give them a wide berth afterwards, for that reason given.  ""We want security, not *intimidation*""

Happened to me, too, such as for a particular asian business, but nowhere nearly as much as for any of my co-workers of different ethnicity.",2015-06-24 20:43:25+00:00,cshhg29,2,t1_csgmw4x,66092,AskReddit
10,"Bioshock has a few titles that'll run natively, and well.  Goat Simulator, the Shadowrun: Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall games are pretty nifty, outside of the crossplatform, though:

Bioware produced quite a few nice titles; the Mass Effect series was pretty good.  As with the rest in here, you'll probably want to keep your eye on the Elder Scrolls (single player) and Fallout series' with the list you've given.  KSP is a bit of a niche, so I can't think of many good titles with a lot of replay that aren't shameless rips.",2015-06-23 16:37:44+00:00,csg1jrj,1,t3_3askvn,44433,patientgamers
