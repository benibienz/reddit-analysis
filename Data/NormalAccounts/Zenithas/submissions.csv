Helpful crash report says ""Install failed"".  Have attempted with 0.0.292, 0.0.291, and 0.0.287, and PTB 0.0.24, no other setups available for testing.

Edit: Have managed to use the workaround posted at https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/4p3glz/discord_installer_workaround/ to bypass this issue.  Installer's failure is troubling, and would still appreciate assistance with this matter.
