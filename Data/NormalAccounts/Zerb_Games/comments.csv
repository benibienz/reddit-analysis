6,"Thanks you so much it was incredibly helpful. I pretty much copy, and pasted yours out of the box. However I noticed a few grammatical errors that bugged me so... Maybe this is just how I write but when doing a sentence like: {It will add to the ""resume"".} You should have the period inside of the quotation marks. Other than that it was perfect.

9,"http://easings.net/ should have all the information on how it works. It should return argument 1, so it all depends on how you use it if you use a piece of code like a += ease(4, a+random(20)) the output will be plus whatever it returns. So if it returns xx*xx the a variable would be +(a+random(20))^2 if that helps any. I'll make an example I guess.",2016-06-10 19:53:12+00:00,d44247m,2.0,t1_d43kaie,24972.0,gamemaker
