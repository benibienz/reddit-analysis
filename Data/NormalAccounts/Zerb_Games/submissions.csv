I'm writing an incredibly important email and would like it to look as professional as possible. This intro I did not proof read btw. Just sayin'. I'm only in 8th grade, which I guess isn't an excuse, but I went to a horrible school this year proofread the following though:
Hello Mr. Iberg, I'm David Sommerfield a previously enrolled student speaking on behalf of myself for the moment be. My parents should be able to get involved soon, but are very busy at the moment.
I am looking to enroll your your high school, for personal academical reasons, overall I've seen your program offers what I will be wanting to do later, and life, and more than anything I would love to take some of the engineering classes (e.g. metal shop, robotics, anything STEM related), and computer science based classes. However, Red Wing schools (the school I attend) does not offer these classes that I intended to peruse I have looked at the classes available to me up until senior year, and the closest thing that I could do was attend word processing classes.
On top of that I attended the one great thing Red Wing schools had to offer, robotics. Which happened to be started by one of my current best friends who now graduated. Him, and his original founders were the corner stones of robotics and without them to teach there is no teachers/mentors that could teach that extracurricular class. Luckly do to my participation in that activity I received an invitation to the FBI on August 30th to attend some computer science, and forensics STEM related presentations. Following Email is attached. Hopefully this adds to a ""resume,"" of somesort.
How I plan to get to school is somewhat of a downside, because it requires the bus services attention. Essentially I live in Red Wing, and living here I have my family here, and responsibilities with them. So I can't flat out stay in Lake City. However I have a person that could drive me From Lake City, to Frontenac, and Possibly to Red wing/From Red wing to Frontenac. I'm not sure what time buses come to Frontenac, but I'll have to look into that. Any information regarding that would be appreciated.
Sorry for contacting you out of Anyone, but I was told to by a close friends parent so I did. I'm really hoping to, and looking forward to attending Lake City schools this upcoming school year. I was hopping this was a low email intake ""season,"" but, it being now August, I'm not too sure on that one.

What is project MTS?
 
So, Project MTS: what is it? Project MTS is a branch of Project Voxel Wars. Project Voxel Wars is a group or rather community collaboration to explore game ideas and variations. (Which you can read more about [here](http://www.voxelwarsnetwork.org/#!about-us/czte).) Project MTS is also a group collaboration that focuses on trying to solve the obstacle of coming up with good, fun, and overall enjoyable features in games. The idea for MTS much like Voxel Wars comes right from the experience my siblings, friends, and I playing specifically FPS type games. We've always questioned why they didn't add this or that. Well, along with the idea of project Voxel Wars, it was simply because either a. they didn't care b. budgets weren't adequate enough or c. they didn't have the idea. So when I started developing games I realized why these ideas didn't come to mind. Simply I was too ""experienced,"" at making games I had lost my intuition by limiting my thought to what I deemed best fit; what would be easy, or be most efficient to accomplish. When I really should of been thinking ""what's a groundbreaking idea,"" I was thinking ""sounds far too hard to add that."" Sadly, that's what it came to me limiting myself and my thoughts, and from what I've collected a lot of game developers struggle with the same thing.. So what is the idea?

But what was limiting my thoughts and how could I overcome it? I tried to process just what was causing it, but every time it came down to two things 1. Human nature makes us use what we already know and b. That I have a greedy capitalistic mind. Yeah, Don't we all? That was my problem. I wanted money, heck who doesn't. But because of this, I would really limit my creativity. So I rethought, I remodeled, I changed my process. So rather than thinking : ""oooo... Dats going to make me some money!"" I thought instead : ""why should I care if my games sells?"" Well, I dropped it I don't care if my game sells, do I want people to like it? Yes! Do I want money for it? Heck yeah! But am I going to charge people for it no. ""What wait now? You spent so much time on it!"" Yeah, I agree with you there. That's why I devised a new system to go along with this fantastic game, the donation bundle. The donation bundle is where if you donate even the most miniscule amount, you get extra bundles for your game. However, if you donate more than the average then you get extra! As much as I hate the idea of DLC business based models it will work. ""B-b-b-but that's not fair!"" Life isn't fair alright? Just kidding, it will be somewhat fair the idea is that if you donate early you'll get the new additions to the game sooner and maybe a little extra. Not only do you have the opportunity to get the additions later on that the donators get immediately if they donate, but, if you do donate you are going to have a guaranteed receival of SOME of these additions (e.g. New weapons, armors, items, etc.). Now I'm going to say right off the bat or owl, I personally like owls, but let's continue: that this wasn't my idea entirely some people may of already came up with this idea, (props to you by the way, if you did [;) but I discussed this with a friend awhile back whom I'll call Chad (I'll reveal his real name if he asks me to) and he was really the basis for this idea.

So let's make a game based off this idea!
 
Obviously, when you decide that you are going to make a game, you don't just down and it happens. It takes quite a bit of Thinking. You need inspiration, whether that be playing a game and taking things you like into consideration, or sitting Down and chatting with a friend about it. Luckily for me, I have some help with that from the Voxel Wars community and my Cousins Mike and Rallo (again, not real names). So we need MORE, MORE, inspiration there is never enough. Let's look at Some other sources. So since I decided this game is going to be an FPS let's look at some of the greatest (by selling or Rating) FPS games.

What things can we learn from other games?
 
Okay, most people that have been alive for more than 20 years and that don't live under a rock know about Doom, the game That really started it all. It was such an amazing game and debatable today it still is, but what made it so great? So First off, to get this out of the way for the time it was really quite an original and never before seen idea as most games were at the time. But now FPS style games that come out are more than less chewed up pieces of tasteless steak compared to the once juicy and tender Doom. A lot of what made it such a great game was that there was less of a directive there were really no, oh you can't do this, or you have to kill this.  It was immediate actions, and your own decisions. It was a very non-linear game which, while could frustrate some more modern day players is a very appealing feature. The idea of discovery is a great one so let's add that to the list. Another thing to take Doom, a game focused On fast movement that allowed players to strafe past damage, or a game like Unreal, which allowed forms of dodging and Wall-jumping is advanced movement. With the rise of more modern shooters or realistic shooters, this idea of advanced movement was lost in favor of more cover-focused play, it seemed as if FPS shooters became really what they were titled; shooters where you Shoot and not much more.

Now shooters over the decades have become less and less adventurous, like I said with Doom the discovery kind of thing is something to consider. Along with that we need interesting and compelling maps that make you think. For example, in one of my favorite oldie fps games ""Ninja Blade,"" to complete The level you needed to find a secret grenade launcher hidden in one of the walls! If that doesn't make you think, I don't Know what does. So another thing to add to the list, make players think!

So let's look at yet another quite famous and oldy game, Wolfenstein. Oh and yes Again the whole discovery aspect is something to take from it. But another thing aside from that, is a feature that is more than less ignored, which is balance. The best way to keep someone intrigued in a game without making them rage quit or quit altogether because the lack of challenge, you need to balance the estimated amount of skill and challenge along with throwing in some very difficult opponents. A good example of this directly from Wolfenstein is Wolfenstein's armored shotgun troopers, holy crap were they hard! But I really either enjoyed or dreaded coming face to face with them, which made my gameplay experience overall more enjoyable.

As we near the end of our list we need to cover some of the basics. You need to give the user input, tell him/her they are doing a good job, or a bad job. But don't go the standard way about it be more creative with it. Instead of being like here have a new gun! Or here's more xp! Make it interesting have it so something actually happens within the game like you get a timed ability or the enemy bursts into guts or something. But what I'm trying to get at is that you need to allow the player to know how they are doing and make it better, a goal, something fun when they do well, or somehow help them out when, they do bad.

Now our list is almost complete, but again we must start and build upon the basics. The game needs to look good, the game needs to feel immersive, some games do a really good job at this, for example, I've gotta give props to Bungie for Destiny, well other than the sh*t story (my opinion, sorry) the game is incredibly immersive and the guns are really smexy.

List
-------------------------------------------------------------
Alrighty here is our final goal list and this will be changed later on and added to:
1. Allow the player to have the ability of discovery.
2. Make them think!
3. Balance difficulty with skill and throw in some challenges.
4. Tell them how they are doing in an interesting way.
5. Make the game immersive.

Keep in mind that *some* of this information can be found in the side bar and on the site ([about us](http://www.voxelwarsnetwork.org/#!about-us/czte)). But that is only a brief detailing of who we or rather who I am. So Zerb Games is an American-based game studio passionate about gaming development, and the people that make our community. We have released 3 titles to date that are only available on Windows. However, we do plan to release future games on other platforms. Zerb Games is attempting to solve the problems that game development has. So far we have launched two projects : Project Voxel Wars, and Project MTS (make them suffer). Project Voxel Wars attempts to tackle the problem that game developers face with coming up with ideas, but as a trademark of Voxel Wars we always keep the community in mind, this time by allowing them to submit ideas. Project MTS is a branch of project Voxel Wars attempting to once again solve the problem that game developers face when trying to come up with ideas. Project MTS is different from project Voxel Wars because it is attempting to look at what made previous games so great and implementing those ""forgotten ideas."" Project MTS is found in WAY more depth on the [site](http://www.voxelwarsnetwork.org/#!Game-Dev-1-What-is-project-MTS-and-what-makes-it-so-great/c7ba/5626c46e0cf25875acb5dc97).
