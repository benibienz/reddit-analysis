16,"&gt; I have a hard time trying to understand why you care so much about the pronunciation of specific consonants in a language you don't even speak fluently.

Because I fear Hebrew may be turning into Turkish or Russian in phonology rather than its own thing. I loathe the assimilation policies Ashkenazis put in that sorta butchered the language, but I understand some of the changes would come eventually (mostly the ones I didn't bother to change). That and to make many words in the language not sound the same.

At best, it'll probably be a sociolectal variant or a liturgical variant, nothing actually used, hence my apathy towards the ideal. The only one I can see catching on is the dagesh thing, if only because it's very easy to do. And even then, I can see why it'll fall flat on its face.

&gt;  Frankly, the change[s] you're suggesting is unnecessarily complex (it took me a few re-reads to get a good grasp of), out-of-touch with the way Hebrew is utilized in daily life and there's a much simpler solution already implemented.

I mean, your solutions involve a gender binary. The main reason I'm implementing this is for people who aren't male or female. 

&gt; English isn't my native language, so please don't take this as too harsh criticism- I'm trying to be constructive. It's a nice effort, but I don't quite see how it could work.

26,"On Twitter heard Roses talk about one FMV star being in softcore porn, so I searched up ""softcore porn fmv actor"", and I managed to find out about **Joanne Takahashi**. So, I saw forum topic mentioning she (Takahashi, not Roses) was in some softcore porn after her career didn't take off as Grace in Gabriel Knight. I found like two remotely porny things on her IMDb page, but I could be wrong.

**Eric**, from *Resident Evil 1* is his likely voiceover, **Sergio Alarcon**, ask Sergio himself said. His real surname is Alarcon not 'Jones', [shown here](https://gamesandmoviesblog.wordpress.com/resident-evil-1996-video-game-live-action-actors/). He didn't become too successful, considering his other biggest role is short-timer on *Baywatch* and probably left Japan for New York at some point- as he was in a terrible B-Movie that featured Erin ""Misty Mundae"" Brown and Michael Sinterniklaas called *Flesh For The Beast*. He also has a brother named Clay (who's stage name is **Clay Enniss**, who worked on *Resident Evil 1* as a voice actor and was in *Deep Freeze*- a game Retsupurae riffed over and works as an English teacher in Japan that his brother starred in as- get this- JACK WIRED) and confirmed Pablo Kuntz voicing a character in the game too. He probably only flew in because Clay was teaching English there. There is an actor from *Deep Freeze*, named **Eric Scott** who may've played Wesker in live action, but it's just a guess.

I couldn't find much on anyone else playing the FMV from RE1, tho the voiceactors are fairly easy to research. By the way, Ward E. Sexton, the narrator confirmed **Jason Wool** and **Una Kavanagh** (**not the Irish actress**, this person is Canadian) did the voices for Joseph Frost and Jill Valentine, respectively (with Jason also doing live action)- but I found nothing on either of them. Linda (Rebecca Chambers) is probably **Linda Rodriguez**, who also worked on *Deep Freeze*. 

There's a sizable scene for Anglophone voice acting/ narration in Japan for videogames (and sometimes in Taiwan and Singapore for animation), as it's often cheap to do it there and somehow voice acting was once a better-paying job there. The most recent game to feature Japanglophone voice acting is *Pokken Tournament*. Yeah, most of their projects ultimately suck, altho there are enough good examples to counter the bad (the early *Tekken* series, *Mega Man ZX Advent*, *Lunar Knights*, *Glass Rose*, and *Elebits*). Somebody should do a video on it, y'know? 

**Min Yee** played the over-the-top General Minh (Brutalmoose already told us about Eileen Weisinger), but is otherwise not an actor let alone a showbiz person. He was the game's executive producer. **Marc Giambruno** worked heavily on the game's development, but not as an actor. His acting credits are limited to being Lifty and Shifty's old voices on Happy Tree Friends, tho he's worked on other video games and even edited the script for the old Jojo's Bizarre Adventure miniseries.

I really liked this episode, because it's one of the few times I've seen a retrotuber focus on the production and creators rather than the finished game and cultural impact, not that either are bad. The only real complaint I have is that everyone (including people in *my* generation) knows about Dana Plato, but it's nice to see a reviewer not bully a fallen child star for a change.

27,"&gt; Ah! Yes, it would be a slur, but queer is actually more or less forbidden here. You don't really hear bender any more and it also means a drinking binge.

Oh, thanks, I see. I was using qu//r as a catch-all term for the general non-straight/cis/dyadic deal, apologies for that usage. I guess, mogai will do.

&gt; My impression is that it doesn't aim to be specifically politically correct... but I am sure most misunderstandings come about from cultural difference.

There's politically incorrect, and then there's morally incorrect. Slurs are pathetic, curse words are politically incorrect. Politically incorrect means not supported by society all the time if ever- but by and large not compeletely wrong, morally incorrect is rightly hated by society and more accurately wrong in of itself. 

Plus, this subreddit is public, so it's not like nobody can not find this and using slurs affecting a particular group would be asking them be excluded anyway.
