I am still new to both voice acting and acting in general, so I am unsure where to find decent classes.

I've considered Michael Minetree/ Minewurx, but I can't find out if he's still active. However, if anyone has any information on him and the studio specifically, please let me know. 

Does anyone here know of a good resource or good place to get trained as a voice actor in DC?",VoiceActing,Reputable Classes (in Washington D.C.)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/59l7uq/reputable_classes_in_washington_dc/

I don't consider Hebrew to be the sole domain of Israeli Jews. Also, I'm trying to add gender-neutral options not remove gender already there. If you think this is a bad idea because ""genderqueer people don't exist"" or something like that, just don't bother commenting.

I have operationalized some tactics/ ideas for genderless Hebrew in cases of genderqueer people and gender-is-uncertain/ gender-is-unnecessary situations.

It affects personal pronouns, the gender of nominals (nouns and adjectives), gendered inflections, and select words like ""person"" and ""sibling"" (see changes below). Of course, it won't be faithful to any historical text or commonplace already by any speaker, but again, I'm trying to add options not force everyone in Israel or the Hebraiophonic world to be ""PC"". 

If you don't believe in genderqueerness, don't bother responding. However, if you feel my ideas are crap for other reasons, feel free to talk and explain some other ideas. 

By the way, Moshe Bar-Asher is the current head of the Academy of the Hebrew Language (the academy referenced in the title).

Without further ado, here are the changes (note that I'm using precise notation, as I have a hard time typing Hebrew on this current computer I have):

--

*Personal Pronouns*

Atte (אתּי) and attu (אתּוּ) become the 2nd person personal pronouns. Their singular suffixes become -khe (כי-) and -khu (כוּ-, and their plural suffixes become -eykhe (יכי-) and -eykhu (יכוּ-), respectively.

Zo (זו) [or maybe ze (זה)] and elle (אלּה) become the 3rd person personal pronouns. Their singular suffixes become -u (וּ-) and -aw (או-), their plural suffixes become -eyhu (יהוּ-) and -oy (ויּ-), respectively. Zot (זות/ זאת) and ellu (אלּוּ) take up the reins as demonstrative pronouns.

*Nominals*

Nouns ending no third letter in the shoresh, ending in the -Vt/ -a suffixes or are of the CiCCaCon mishqal become ""class 1"" rather than ""feminine"", while all others are ""class two"" rather than ""masculine"". 

Regarding gender variable nouns and adjectives: if a shoresh has no third letter, then the class 1 noun takes over. Otherwise, class 2 takes over- except in cases where the other is more common, like 'hore' (parent). 

Wil ויּל (plural wilim ויּליּם), achi אחיּ (plural achyim אחיייּם), dawed דווד (plural dodim or dwadim דוודיּם), savat סבת (plural svatim סבתיּם), kalle כלּה (plural kallim כלּיּם), chitnan חיּתנן (plural chitnanim חיּתנניּם), ban בן (plural bnim בניּם), nkhada נכדה (plural nkhadot נכדות) become the words for ""human"", ""sibling"", ""aunt/ uncle"", ""grandparent"", ""child-in-law"", ""bridegroom"", ""child"",  and ""grandchild""- respectively. ""Cousin"", ""niece/ nephew"", ""spouse's sibling/ sibling-in-law"" and ""widow(er)"" just take the masculine forms (dodan, achyan, gis, and alman). 

Wil is just a variant yours truly made up of Classical Hebrew 'ewil' (""man, citizen""), the rest should seem self-explanatory, otherwise just ask and I'll explain. Choten (spelled het-waw-taw-nun, plural chutnim/ chotnim) becomes the word for ""parent-in-law"", which I couldn't type in Hebrew due to a formatting error.

*Verbs*

The future tense/ imperative verbs just take the masculine form as neutral, as it's already heading that way. 

The past tense uses -te/-tu (תוּ/-תה-) and -e/-u (-וּ/ה-) for the suffixes regarding second and third person pronouns, respectively.

The present tense inflects for the repurposed class system not gender. However, pronouns (*mainly in cases of gender ambiguity or gender uselessness*) can take any inflected verb (regarding class) they want grammatically. So ""attu kotbim"" and ""attu kotbot"" are both correct. 

Thanks for reading.

UPDATE: Added the Hebrew spelling, which contains dageshes so people know the full pronunciation. I'm aware yod-dagesh means two y sounds, not one i sound, but I'm also unable to type niqqud very well. I'm also aware two yods mean ""ay"" or ""ey"", but that's just being used by analogy to two waws and because of the previous circumstance. 

Also, I wish more people would use alef as an ""a"" vowel, and use yod for ""e"" vowels (that become ""i"") and i or e before two consonants; and pronounce waw, use dagesh for reysh and alef (in case where it's not a vowel) and dagesh hazak, but *those* are pipe dreams. I still do these, but only in personal writing/ speaking.",hebrew,Should I message Moshe Bar-Asher or The Academy about my ideas for gender-neutral Hebrew?,https://www.reddit.com/r/hebrew/comments/4h54q1/should_i_message_moshe_barasher_or_the_academy/

How should I go about using a stage name in acting classes/ workshops, community theater, and amateur media?
