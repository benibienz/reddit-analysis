**Fat Varian** feels underwhelming. He has decent sustain, decent cc, and decent survivability, but he ends up being the jack of all trades, and master of none IMO. Definitely not a solo tank at the very least. And the ult sounds good on paper, but seems to play just awful. Short range, short duration, and too long of a cooldown.

**Hulk Varian** feels really strong; he can deal a ton of burst and is really sticky. The ultimate is definitely the best of the three, but the passive is probably the worst. You can straight-up erase lower health heroes from a good distance with the build. And the ult has a really low cooldown.

**Samuro Varian** can solo boss at lvl 10 only auto attacking, so he's got that going for him. He does a lot of sustained damage, and the speed bonus is huge. That said, he loses the burst of the Colossus ultimate. I think it's a toss-up between the two as far as which you should be picking. Both do a ton of damage, both can chase like an Illidan, and both have good self-sustain in fights. If you need the burst, Colossus is probably the choice. If you need sustain and a bit more survivability, go Twin Blades.",2016-11-08 04:28:16+00:00,d9qnf1n,1.0,t3_5bqvk2,4332.0,heroesofthestorm

**Fiery War Axe** - (2 mana 3/2 weapon) - Basically a Bolt with rebound for 2 mana. You may take some damage in the process, but still incredibly strong.

**Tracking** - (1 mana, look at the top 3 cards of your library, one to hand, the other two to the yard) - would be far and away the best cantrip in the game.

**Shadowbomber** (1 mana, 2/1 creature. ETB, 3 damage to each player.) - suicidal savannah bolt

**Loatheb** (5 mana, 5/5 creature. ETB, spells your opponents cast next turn cost 5 more.) - A time walk stapled to a 5/5. Might be a bit too slow to be ""broken"" though.

**Innervate** (0 mana, add 2 to your mana pool.) - Somewhere between Black Lotus and Lotus Petal.

161,"Ankhya's ultimate is incredibly strong, but so is nearly every planeswalker ultimate. The major problem with the old ult as I saw it was not the power-level, but the amount that it stalled out games. This still leaves you an easy way to end the game, and your opponent a few potential, if difficult, ways of doing so. I don't really see it as being any more boring than a Karn or Dovin ult.

Garruk's wording is based off of the Chain Veil, and as much as I wish there were, I don't think that there's a cleaner way to word it. 

Tibalt doesn't need any extra rules text because of how planeswalker starting loyalty works. See 306.5b:  
""A planeswalker is treated as if its text box included, “This permanent enters the battlefield with a number of loyalty counters on it equal to its printed loyalty number.” This ability creates a replacement effect (see rule 614.1c).""

What do you think of a change in emblem to ""Prevent all damage that would be dealt to you by creatures.""?

&gt;OP described it as an Ally deck. See, I understand that as meaning ""a deck that takes advantage of the Ally creature type"" and, having played in many BFZ drafts, can infer that it would likely involve interacting with the Rally mechanic. Especially considering the fact that a defining characteristic of the Ally creature type is ""interacts favorably with other allies.""

There are cards that interact with allies that don't have Rally. You're making a much larger logical leap in saying that OP's deck is a Rally deck because it has allies than I am in saying that it's an Aristocrats deck because he described it as an Aristocrats deck.

&gt;You criticize my reading comprehension, but you're the one who's trying to stretch the similarity of OPs deck with Rally the Ancestors by claiming that RtA decks played Healer early on. Sure they did, but not in any versions that dominated the format, so why bother including it at all? It was not an RtA card because it wasn't good enough to be. Which is why OP posted about a Healer based deck in this thread.

I mentioned it existing in old versions to make the point of how Rally is just a more refined version of what OP described, and hence that they decks most likely play very similarly.

&gt;If you think OP misunderstood you, then you clearly didn't understand the point of OP's reply

OP seemed to think that I was talking about the mechanic Rally, not the deck. How is that not him misinterpreting me? And really? You dug into the thread on something that wasn't even a reply to OP or yourself to make that point? Very classy.

&gt;OP was saying here that the Rally deck that you were talking about (the Ancestors) was not what they were talking about (a Rally the mechanic deck.) That you came away from that exchange thinking OP originally thought you were claiming a Rally (the mechanic) deck was format defining is certainly illustrative of your arrogant charge to dismiss OP's contribution to the thread. Or, as I said before, ""being a smug jerk.""

I think it would be good for you to check that you're actually reading my comments, and not just looking in a mirror.

If OP had described it as a Rally deck instead of an Aristocrats deck, I'd be much more inclined to believe this logic. There's no reason to believe that Kalastria Healer wasn't the only card in the deck with rally. Whereas, while Zulaport was still just 1/4 cards that he named, he also described the deck as an Aristocrats deck.

Once again, did I say that the allies protoversion of Rally was format-defining? No I most certainly fucking did not. A little bit of reading comprehension would serve you well.

&gt;Um

If it's in 1/4 cards that he specifically mentioned, is it really the primary mechanic?

&gt;&gt;Ah, I completely forgot about Rally being a mechanic.

&gt;Your memory is real short there, bud.

Again, 1/4 cards. And he talked about an Abzan Ally Aristocrats deck, not a rally deck. Not once did OP say the word Rally.

&gt;&gt;Rally was an Abzan Aristocrats deck which played Zulaport. That alone makes the decks nearly identical.

&gt;It would if OP were only talking about taking advantage of Cutthroat. As you said, OP was talking about a deck, one which focused on the rally mechanic, and has a totally different game plan than the Rally the Ancestors decks.

Again, OP's deck was an Aristocrats deck, not a Rally deck. Rally (the deck) was a strong Aristocrats deck in the Colors OP talked about that used one of the cards OP talked about, which used to use some of the other cards OP talked about until it was refined, and which had a similar gameplan to OP's deck. I don't see why you're so stubbornly refusing to accept that the cards are similar.

&gt;Did any of them try to take advantage of the Rally mechanic? I don't recall any ever being format defining.

They took advantage of Rally just as much as OP's deck did; with Kalastria healer. I never claimed that they were fomat-defining. In fact, I specifically said that it was only the early unrefined versions that heavily played allies.

&gt;You're being a smug jerk to someone who is posting in the spirit of the thread about trying to play bad cards, as if they couldn't possibly want to break BW Allies unless they were oblivious to Rally the Ancestors.

R: Aggro. Creatures that burn, burn creatures, and burn face. BURN! There is also a mythical ""big red deck (midrange)"" that only exists when theorycrafting for new expansions, and then proceeds to never be played. 

G: Midrange. Ramp and efficient creatures.

______________

UW: Control. White removal, blue counterspells and card draw.

WB: Midrange or creature-based control. Black and white creatures, black and white removal, and black card draw.

WR: Aggro or midrange. Red and white early-game creatures, red burn, and white removal all lend to an aggressive playstyle, but in some formats, the white 3-5 cost creatures are good enough, and the red removal is good enough that a midrange deck emerges.

WG: Midrange. White and green cards can accommodate nearly all types of midrange decks in the right format, from the faster board-flooding decks, to long grindy decks that can generate incredible amounts of value over the course of the game.

UB: Control. Efficient black removal and card draw, blue counterspells and card draw.

UR: Tempo. Red and blue tempo creatures, red burn, and blue tempo spells.

UG: Tempo. Green and blue tempo creatures. 

BR: Aggro. Using the aggressive creatures from red and black, as well as red burn and occasionally black removal, black/red decks can generate explosive, but typically fragile boards early in the game.

BG: Midrange. The grindiest of midrange decks. Long games revolving around the incremental value and incredible efficiency of green and black creatures. Usually there are graveyard interactions.

RG: Aggro or Ramp. Green red aggro decks are explosive and revolve around cheap creatures with lots of stats. Green/Red ramp decks are largely green, typically only splashing red for a bit of removal and some larger creatures.

406,"&gt;Is there any online simulators for free? In yugioh we have Ygopro. So something close to that where you can build any deck and test it against a bot.

Depends on what you want. 

The only official one is Magic Duels, but it doesn't have anywhere close to all the cards and it has a f2p structure similar to hearthstone for getting cards. I wouldn't recommend it other than for learning the rules. 

The unofficial ones are Xmage and Cockatrice. If you're fairly familiar with the rules, I would strongly recommend Cockatrice. If not, use Xmage. Xmage is clunkier, slower, and has a smaller playerbase, but has rules support. So it can be better if you're slightly newer to the game.

Cockatrice is more of a sandbox, and it plays out quite a bit like paper magic, hence it's much smoother, has no bugs, and is quick.

&gt;Also, should this be how I start to get into it? What helped you get into magic and play better?

Drafting is absolutely the best way to get into the game and learn to play better. I would also recommend going to the Kaladesh prerelease event in 2 weeks.

&gt;Lastly, is there budget decks out there for me to use to compete on some scale? I'm still invested in yugioh, so I want to not blow all my money in one place.

www.mtggoldfish.com has some semi-competitive budget decks.

613,"It's the difference between a card that gains you card advantage and a card that doesn't. Most cards are considered 1-for-1s: by playing them, you cost yourself a card, bit gain a card's worth of value, either by drawing a card, getting a minion, or removing one of your enemy's cards. A few examples of cards like that are most minions, tracking, assassinate, journey below, etc. However, there are some cards which give you net positive card advantage. Cards like arcane intellect, mind control, burgle, blade of c'thun, pantry spider, etc. are considered 2-for-1s, and so on.

The distinction between something that gives you a card (like unstable portal, shiv, and many others) and a card that shuffles a card into your deck is huge. Shuffling cards into your deck is gaining no card advantage, and very little advantage of any sort. To show the difference, imagine that forgotten torch just straight-up gave you a roaring torch instead of putting it in your deck. The card would probably need to cost somewhere around 6-7 mana instead of the 3 it costs now.

At very worst, and this doesn't happen often, it can effectively put you down on card advantage if you draw a card that's useless for your deck because you had to entomb it.",2016-08-21 20:49:24+00:00,d6r049q,5.0,t1_d6qzx4m,293.0,hearthstone

It's not a ""minor change"" for 4 mana, it's the difference between a 2-for-1 removal spell that cheats on mana and a 1-for-1 removal spell whose effect is a downside for you as often as it's an upside.

Shuffling a card into your deck is so immeasurably different from putting it directly into play.

767,"The thing is though, basically everything you said was wrong in one way or another:

First and foremost, you're evaluating each of the abilities as if its its own card, not the ability on a versatile planeswalker. Just look at planeswalkers that see play. What you said is the equivilent of looking at Jace the Mind Sculptor and saying that Brainstorm is a 1 mana card, so it being a 0 ability on a 4 mana planeswalker is too weak. Also, as planeswalkers get cheaper, you have to be more cautious about the power-level of their abilities, just look at the new Nissa, Liliana, or Lili of the Veil.

Provoking an opponent's creature has tons of precedent in red. In fact, the ability as written would be stretching the color pie to print in white.

Your evaluation of the ""Blaze"" ability ties back to my first point; it's the ability on a planeswalker. You can't have a planeswalker with other functionalities that also works as a broken burn spell (2 times X would be broken in standard, and probably modern). And once again, it can't be a -X.

Gamble is firstly, a very strong card on its own, that if it were printed today would probably cost 2 mana. And secondly, this is attached to a variable costed planeswalker with other decently powerful abilities that can potentially be cast on turn 2.

Tibalt 2's first ability can't really be a +1 due to the versatility of the card. Dealing 1 to just your opponents creatures is worth about a card and two mana. 

Gamble can't be a -1 or zero because this is (once again) a variable-costed planeswalker. You're basically talking about getting a gamble every turn for 2 mana, with additional versatility.

The ult is not blue in the least. Red has historically had graveyard hate and burn. It doesn't need any blue. And it can't mill or deal damage equal to your graveyard because neither of those effects are red...

You can split hairs and say that this isn't an intrinsic feature of draw-go control in some metaphysical sense, but in the real world draw-go control is seen as a strategy that produces miserable games and it shouldn't be hard to understand why Wizards wants to avoid that. The same goes for combo decks - they aren't pushed in standard because they tend to be completely uninteractive and that sucks.

Maybe the best answer would be to make it have multiple minus abilities, and no plus abilities. Like a -1, a -3, and a -5 or something. It would definitely fit Tibalt's personality if nothing else.

It is not my time. Not yet."" The way she said, yet, sent a shiver through Jace's neck. She resumed her writing, blotting out a large section of dried ink.

Other than the fact that Emmy imprisoned itself, this also nearly confirms what many have suspected for a while; Ulamog and Kozilek existed to ""prime"" worlds for some sort of recreation by Emrakul. We can assume Ulamog would destroy the old world, then Kozilek would make the ""soil receptive"" and plant ""blossoms"". 

Also, with what Tamiyo said and all, and I could be very wrong on this point, it seems possible that the scroll used to destroy worlds was used by Emrakul to recreate Ulamog, given that it is more or less destruction incarnate. Emrakul seemed to think of the other two titans as parts of itself, rather than separate entities, so it spending time in the moon to grow and wait for when the world is ready seems to strongly indicate that it's resummoning one or both of the titans.

From a writing standpoint, not only was this fantastic by itself, for me it redeemed the BFZ block. *This* is what I was hoping for in their fight against Kozilek. *This* made the eldrazi really seem like what they were meant to be.

880,"&gt;The artist thing

You said it yourself. Most female artists simply don't typically paint the sort of subject magic that mtg requires. The ones who do, and are good at it, are hired. No reason to attribute some sort of sexist conspiracy to it when there's a perfectly reasonable explanation and no good reason not to hire female artists if their art fits the art direction.

&gt;Women in art and as planeswalkers.

You're going to need some serious citations on those accusations. Lately, it's been pretty apparent that they have been pushing for equal representation of male and female characters both as characters and in the art. Just glance at the last few sets shows a 50:50 ratio of women to men in art, if not higher.

&gt;Toxicity towards women in the game, especially the competitive scene

This is obviously a huge problem when it does occur. Personally, on a local level, I have yet to see any of this. There are fewer female than male players by a fairly large margin, but I haven't seen any difference in treatment of players. But I can't speak for all areas and I'm sure that there places where it happens. Also, you said it yourself: WotC is taking a strong stance and are clearly trying to fix this.

&gt;Appealing to their largest market

Not only are the claims you make largely incorrect, but there wouldn't even be all that much wrong with it if they were. If your product is being most largely consumed by ""boys 14 and up"" it's bad business *not* to appeal to them in some way.

&gt;Sources and Numbers to back up your claims

1005,"&gt;But this isn't efficient card draw. This is much closer to [[Tormenting Voice]] or [[Dangerous Wager]] than [[Compulsive Research]], considering this effect is basically weaker than the discard-first approach that red takes and offers literally the opposite of the filtering of blue's discard-second approach.

No, it is much, much closer to compulsive research than the other two (and all other red ""draw"" spells) for one very simple reason: it results in card advantage. Red very very rarely gets straight-up card advantage from its draw spells, even if they have downsides. The only time red gets card advantage is when an opponent can choose not to give it to them (does *not* apply to this card) or in the form of its ""exile draw"" like in [[commune with lava]] .

I can understand the black angle. Even without precedent for this kind of effect, Coercion-style cards are strongly associated with black. 

&gt;But a blue mage would never want to both give the opponent information and let that opponent use that information against them. Blue cards that give the opponent choices will always either conceal information, such as [[Master of Predicaments]], or have the final say anyway, such as [[Fact or Fiction]].

[[epiphany at the drownyard]] [[fatespinner]] [[gifts ungiven]] [[intuition]] [[library of lat-nam]] [[murmurs from beyond]] [[trade secrets]] 


&gt;Red, on the other hand, has a history of giving up control as a downside. [[Browbeat]] [[Vexing Devil]] [[Flamewake Phoenix]] [[Goblin Lore]] [[Flaming Gambit]]

Yes, but it's a different *type* of choice to give your opponent than what blue does (as I already mentioned). FoF and similar cards are much more similar to this effect.

&gt;Now, I'm not saying this card can't be in blue. Like I mentioned earlier, there's no precedent, so it can be whatever you choose. I'm just giving my take on the color pie.

1202,"1-3 colors is fine in standard, the more colors, the more expensive lands you'll have to buy typically.

18-28 lands is the norm. 18 only for *extremely* aggressive decks with few to no cards that cost more than 2 mana, and 28 only for extreme control decks that really need to hit land drops. The typical midrange deck runs 24-26.

White is suited to well to all archetypes, but is most commonly found in midrange and some control decks. Blue is mostly the control color, but can be found in some aggressive/tempo decks and the occasional midrange list. Black works for all archetypes, but currently in standard isn't well suited for aggro. Red is the aggro color, but finds its way into the other archetypes regularly for its efficient removal and decent midrange creatures. Green is the typically found in midrange, but green is found commonly in aggro decks as well.

Your ""mana curve"", or the amount of cards that you have in your deck at each mana cost should look just like that--a curve. In a faster midrange or slower aggro deck, you should have mostly 2-4 drops with only a few 5+ drops in midrange. In a more aggressive aggro deck, you should have mostly 1-2 drops with maybe 3-6 3 drops. In a slower midrange deck, you should have mostly 2-4 drops, but since you're playing a bit more removal, you can afford to play a few more high cost cards. The mana curve for control decks varies wildly and is something that you just have to get a feel for on a deck-by-deck basis.

www.mtggoldfish.com can help you get a good idea of what cards are good in constructed, and in which varieties of decks they are good. It also has lists for decks that perform well in competitive environments, if that's something that you're looking for. Once you have decided on the color(s) that you want to play and the archetype, look for cards that you think would fit well into the deck. Try to narrow it down to roughly 9 cards. Get 4 copies of each of those cards and roughly 24 lands of the respective colors.

Wizards responds, people get even more mad. People forget, and in a month or two it will be regarded as good decision. Happens every month pretty much. 

This is an overall positive change that was announced in the worst way possible (as is WotC tradition it seems) It takes away something from the pros who are no longer perform well at a competitive level in the game, and in exchange rewards people who *do* perform well and helps to grow the game as a whole.

1235,"**Overhyped: C'Thun or Evolve**

_________________

C'Thun is simply not a card that Blizz can afford make that powerful. Firstly, C'Thun decks are going to be so cheap to make that nearly everybody will be able to assemble one with very little investment; it would both allow for F2P to be an *easy* way to play the game, and would wreak havoc on the ladder. That's obviously something that Blizz would want to avoid, so it makes me dubious that C'Thun decks are designed as anything more than a decent starting place for new players (this is a big problem that comes up again and again from new players). Secondly, you're sacrificing *so* much on most of the C'Thun minions (there are some great ones, but the majority simply do too little to help keep you alive against midrange decks. It probably beats aggro decks, just due to cards like Disciple of C'Thun, Ancient Shieldbearer, Twin Emperor, the 5/7 taunt, and the 6/5 healbot. But against midrange decks it doesn't interact well or drop enough high-value creatures in the midgame to survive.

__________________________

Evolve will probably be decent, but the amount of hype, especially for godawful combos (like Onyxia -&gt; evolve just for starters) is off the charts. The card is amazing when you can establish a board, or when you can build up lots of totems. When you can do neither of those things, it's a much weaker card than people are acting like it is.

**Underhyped: Darkshire Councilman or Mukla**

Darkshire has some huge potential for the newest version of zoo, especially with Warlocks having been given an incredibly powerful new token-making card in the form of Forbidden Tentacles. 5 toughness is also a great number and warlock is arguably the best class for the card to have been in. I'm a bit scared that this card may become our new cancerous overlord.

Moving back to the original topic, it has so many many issues; firstly, the color scheme is awful, the bright green and faded red do not look great together; secondly, the photorealism of the art clashes with the ""blurry"" border to make both parts of the card seem out of place and disjointed; thirdly, the glare from the sun makes does nothing good for the piece, it's definitely not Avon's best work for that reason alone; and finally, the art is monochromatic to an extreme, there are plenty of pieces of art in magic that heavily use a single color (and in the majority it detracts from the art), but this is one of the most egregious cases.

The game was attrition to the extreme, my pool was not great (only two removal spells and only like 8 decent playables in each color.) so I had somehow ended up building two decks, and aggressive Izzet deck, and a Abzan delerium midrange deck. This game was of course with the abzan one. The game had stalled out, and my opponent seemed to have gotten every clue-related card in the set. Each turn he would get clues, if he attacked, he got clues, when he cast spells, he got clues, he was exiling cards from his graveyard to get clues, when his creatures died he got clues, and of course he could tutor a card each turn. Thankfully he seemed to have nothing good to tutor, I think what he got was one of the 4/4 hexproof tramplers, an obsessive skinner, and a thing in the ice. I found ways to deal with the thing in the ice, but each turn his 4/4 was getting bigger and bigger due to skinner. It must have been at least a 9/9 by the end of the game. Regardless, I was really starting to get worried at this point, when I looked at his library... and saw the 3 cards left in it. He had quite literally milled himself to death. That game left us with 10 minutes for the last one or two games (thankfully I made sure it was only one.)

I'm a but surprised that anyone would play that card, much less that it was actually working for him. But w/e, the game is all but over anyways. The next two turns, I draw lands, and he [[structural distortions]]. That's right. 3. STRUCTURAL. DISTORTIONS. I nearly tilted off the face of the earth, but did my best to maintain my composure.

It also has the two spirit making guys that are incredibly strong as well as the most playable card in the vessel cycle.

Red is built to be very aggressive, and so is harder to make work in a format that has felt pretty slow, it's got enough fine non-aggressive cards that you can play it as a secondary color for though, and has the most support for madness. 

Blue just feels a tiny bit too slow compared to the other colors and lacks strong creatures for the most part. That's not to say that it's unplayable by any means, it just requires a bit more than the other colors to make work. Those are my impressions at least.

1414,"No offense intended, but much of what you asked was pretty unintelligible, so I'm just gonna give you an quick explanation of how combat works.

One clarification before I start, though, creatures don't enter tapped unless the card specifies it to (cards like [[shambling ghoul]] )

So, when creatures enter the battlefield (whether they're cast from your hand or got there some other way), they have what's called ""summoning sickness"". That simply means that they can't attack or activate their abilities that require them to tap as a cost ( [[reckless scholar]] 's ability for example). Once they have existed on your side of the battlefield for a turn, they no longer have summoning sickness.

_____________

It's probably easiest to explain how combat works if I first describe the basics of the turn structure. Turns in magic work in steps and phases. You don't have to be too worried about memorizing these, but they're helpful to know. They are:

Untap - When your turn starts and all of your permanents untap simultaneously.

Upkeep - When any abilities that trigger at the beginning of your upkeep happen.

Draw - When you draw a card for the turn, unless it's the first turn of the game and you went first.

Precombat Main - When you can play lands, creatures, and sorceries. 

Combat - When combat happens. I'll go into more detail shortly.

Postcombat Main - Same as the precombat main, except after combat.

End Step - Nothing really happens.

Cleanup Step - ""Until end of turn"" effects end, damage taken this turn is removed from creatures, and you discard down to seven cards if you have more than seven.

_____________

So as for combat, when it begins, you can declare any creatures you control that are untapped and don't have summoning sickness, these are ""declared attackers"" and become tapped unless they have vigilance.

Your opponent declares any number of their untapped creatures (whether or not they have summoning sickness) as blockers for each of your attacking creatures.

First Strike damage is dealt by any creatures that have first strike or double strike. If the creature is blocked by one or more creatures, they attacking player chooses how the damage is divided among those creatures, as long as he or she assigns lethal damage to as many of the blocking creatures as possible (for example, if a 4/4 is attacking and is blocked by two 2/3s, the attacking player can choose to have it deal 3 to one creature and 1 to the other or 4 to one of the creatures, but they can't choose to have it deal 2 to both creatures). Creatures that aren't blocked and are attacking simply deal damage to the defending player. Creatures that are blocking a creature deal damage to the attacking creature that they are blocking. Creatures dealt lethal damage at this point die.

Normal combat damage is dealt by creatures without first strike and creatures with double strike. How damage is dealt is the same as for how first strike damage is dealt. Creatures dealt lethal damage at this point die.

1470,"Here's all of the notable cards for constructed that I saw. They probably aren't all playable, in fact most are probably unplayable, but I think all at least warrant some discussion: 

[Geier Reach Bandit](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_XaNjBsZHgZ.png) // [flip](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_0vMvoswXRR.png) - Hasty Werewolf that's fairly efficient and gives more value to your other werewolves. Probably won't do anything on its own for constructed, but seems like it should be considered in building a werewolf deck, if it turns out that one is viable (seems unlikely currently).

[Skin Invasion](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_1T9lEDiYNi.png) // [flip](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_7AF7mkhc0A.png) - Huge value if you can flip it. The problem here is instant-speed removal, and situations where there are no creatures on the battlefield, or no creatures that are good targets for it.

[Hermit of the Natterknolls](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_hj1IJcH3T9.png) // [flip](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_9axA8qCJIK.png) - Might be decent versus control, and helps to flip your other wolves. The problem lies in them casting their instant-speed spells in response to this, and then they can answer it on their turn with you getting essentially no value from it.

[Erdwal Illuminator](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_9ZaSBX5Cse.png) - Some decks may want this effect. I don't really know which deck, but I think its possible.

[Essence Flux](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_RjHEh4qXgM.png) - Blue cloudshift with an extra line of flavor text. Probably awful, but if a deck wants flicker effects, this is a decent rate.

[Nagging Thoughts](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_chRMwLDgFu.png) - Anticipate-esque. Has madness, and can very slightly fill up your graveyard. I'm definitely keeping an eye on this card.

[Alms of the Vein](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_pALi18FuRi.png) - This is another decent payoff card for the vampire madness deck, depending on how aggressive it is and how reliable its madness enablers are.

[Pale Rider of Trostad](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_fFS46deIyh.png) - Okay, this one may be a bit more optimistic than the others, but the art is what pushed me over the edge and made me include it. Could see some play in madness-heavy decks. Comparable to Heir of Flakenrath, but the downsides seem much bigger than the upsides when compared head-to-head. If you're playing this card, you're probably playing 4 heirs already.

[Bloodmad Vampire](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_3t2hhxIu1X.png) - Might be another payoff card for the madness decks if they're really in need of more madness cards.

[Loam Dryad](http://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_u13fxiCBTY.png) - Again, a bit optimistic, but it technically can be a 1-cost mana dork.

To learn the game, I would recommend checking Magic Duels: Origins from either Steam or IOS/Android. It's kind of a crappy game, but it teaches the basics well.

If you're just playing with friends, you can play pretty much however you want, though I would suggest getting a Clash Pack, Duel Decks, or two Intro Packs to play against eachother at a fairly even level. If you'd rather try building your own decks, the deck builder's toolkit is a good tool.

If you're looking to play at your local store, you should decide on a format. The major ones are modern, standard, and draft. In loose HS terms, Modern = Wild, Standard = Standard, and Draft = Arena. Regardless of how you want to play, the upcoming Shadows over Innistrad Prerelease event should be a good way to get started playing if you're intimidated at the prospect of playing at a game store. 

Prereleases are Limited (meaning you don't bring a preconstructed deck) events where you get 6 packs of the upcoming set as well as a random rare or mythic date-stamped promo card to build a 40 card deck from. Basic Lands are provided. They tend to be fairly casual events that newer players are encouraged to attend. ",2016-03-15 00:49:28+00:00,d1024d7,1.0,t3_4ag21a,408.0,magicTCG

Dr. Boom is good because of a mix of the sheer efficiency of the card, the fact that it's split between multiple bodies (more difficult to remove without losing tempo), and the card advantage that the bots potentially provide when they die.

High costed minions NEED to have an impact, they can't just be stats. It's the reason that a card like a 7 mana 8/8 or a 8 mana 10/10 would not be absurdly strong. At that portion of the game, your cards need to be good enough to win you the game or shift the game in your favor.

1586,"1) Standard, modern, and draft are the 3 major competitive formats. I would reccomend playing both draft and either standard or modern. Standard is a rotating format, with 5-6 sets legal in it at any given time. Modern is a nonrotating format, with all cards since about 2003, save for a relatively small banlist, legal in it. Draft is a form of limited (whereas modern and standard are constructed) where each player gets three booster packs, picks a card from one, passes the remaining cards to the adjacent player, and this process is repeated until each pack is empty, at which point each player builds a 40 card deck from those cards and basic lands, which are supplied.
2) Standard decks are usually between $40 and $500, with the average around $200-$300. Currently standard decks cost closer to $1000, which is obviously not a great situation. But that price will go down drastically with the coming rotation. Modern decks are upwards of $800, but some more gimmicky decks can be cheaper. Currently modern is not a good format to invest in due to recent bannings and some new card printings wreaking havoc on the format. The problem should be resolved when the next set is released and the new ba list is revealed with it.

3) www.channelfireball.com and www.mtggoldfish.com are both good resources.

4) There is quite a bit of skill involved. Luck is still a factor, but is much less so than in yu gi oh. And I would say that yes, it is the most difficult tcg at higher levels of play.",2016-03-11 14:45:58+00:00,d0vzk10,1.0,t3_49z1ep,473.0,magicTCG

EDIT (for all you naysayers and downvoters):

&gt;Images flashed, memories of the hedron network as it once was, as Nissa had seen it. Leylines crisscrossed the world in shallow arcs, guided and constrained by the hedron network. Eventually, across thousands of miles, they looped, crossed, and enclosed the titans in a prison of pure mana.

&gt;The hedrons pulsed, occasionally, sent out bursts of wild mana through the leylines. Those bursts rippled across the land, giving rise to whirling winds and tumbling rocks of the Roil. Nissa hadn't understood it then, but she did now: the titans were trying to escape. The hedrons drained their strength, dispersing their exertions out into web of leylines.

1651,"I think this card has a decent shot at seeing standard play, but first people have got to take a step away from the hype train and accept a few facts:

- This card is not delver. It's not comparable to delver. It doesn't play the same as delver. It doesn't go in the same decks as delver. It's cost is hugely different than delver's. And its flip trigger is not even similar. Delver should not be a point of comparison when talking about the card; literally the only similarities are the p/t, flying, and the fact that it's a dfc.

- In a vacuum, this card is awful. If you're playing this card, you're playing it to interact with madness. Spending 2 mana and 2 cards for a 3/2 flyer is awful, and 2 mana for a 2/1 is pretty bad as well. You need to have quite a few madness cards in your deck to even consider playing it.

- To make this deck work, the madness cards that they do print need to be efficient, aggressive, on-color, and cheap. This is not a card you want to be throwing into a midrange or control deck. The payoff is just not there. You need to be going fully aggro to make this card work. It's also not a card you want to be playing later in the game, so you ideally want cheap madness cost cards. We already have 1 card like this confirmed (the madness bolt) but I'd expect that we need at least 1-2 more before the deck becomes remotely viable.

Formats, on the other hand, allow them to fix these problems while keeping the barrier for entry low and minimalizing the damage done to long-time players.

1836,"***A***

I think removing them is mostly to help with the constraints of mobile devices and to make the store a bit less cluttered. I don't necessarily agree with this, and would like to be able to play the adventures, but in response to your point F I do mention why being able to buy old content is not actually that helpful.

***B***

I dont really know what to say about that other than that I don't think that will happen. This is a large change for the long-term health of the game. Not supporting the secondary format well would lead to long-term problems with the health of the game which would seem contrary to this.

***C***

This balancing isn't as hard as you make it out to be. Despite being a 20+ year old format, mtg's vintage is healthy and playable - the main concern about vintage is the price (deep into the 5 digits) which is not nearly as much of a concern for HS. Things will eventually be much, much more poweful than standard, and strong combos will exist, but that doesn't make the format *bad*. Reno is a legitimate concern, and may sadly just end up as an eternal staple of Wild decks unless consistency is more needed.

***D*** 

You did not lose value on buying older cards.
It doesn't matter if you spent $5 on cards or $6000, you got you money's worth. Competitive cards cycle out of the meta regardless of having a true rotation. We already saw this happening, and there is really nothing that Blizz would be able to do stop this other than just stop printing new sets (obviously that's a horrible idea). The meta changes. That's a fact. And so will the meta cards. Adding standard doesn't make this any more true, just more apparent. And if they hadn't added formats to this game, they would have had to resort to excessive nerfs or power-creep, which would make your cards irrelevant just as fast, if not faster. So while you did put money into meta cards, those cards were never safe, regardless of Standard.

***E***

Ultimately, some sort of rotation is needed for the game to survive. And regardless of rotation, the meta changes. Decks change. Decks become no longer viable / less viable. If they hadn't decided to use a rotating format, they would have instead had to resort to excessive nerfs of older cards or extreme power creep. Either option leads to your old decks being outclassed just as quickly, if not more quickly, than a rotating format. Playing a mech deck in Wild is not realistically any worse than playing one in a meta where it's vastly outclassed.

***F*** 

Wild is not much, if any, more expensive than normal HS would have been to get into.
People are pointing to them no longer selling packs or adventures as making Wild more expensive, but realistically, as more sets get released, the playable cards will eventually become so spread out between all of the sets, that even if old sets' packs were availible, it would not be realistic or efficient to buy those packs to acquire cards from them. As for adventures, the fact that they are craftable, and perhaps more importantly, disenchantable, will make it much easier to get lower-rarity cards from them, and even will make it easier to get higher-rarity cards from the later wings. Finally, the fact that standard exists means that new players have a place to play somewhat competitively for a while before getting enough of a collection to get into Wild.",2016-02-04 19:35:50+00:00,cznwcfx,2.0,t1_cznp2hs,9897.0,hearthstone

As for adventures, the fact that they are craftable, and perhaps more importantly, disenchantable, will make it much easier to get lower-rarity cards from them, and even will make it easier to get higher-rarity cards from the later wings.

1848,"No offense intended, but you clearly don't understand the motivations behind this change or what effects it will have.

Firstly, it's designed to keep the game alive. As the game progressed in its current form, the meta would have become more and more stagnant. New sets that are the same power-level as current sets would subsequently have less impact on the format, and it would just become more and more difficult to get into the game. Blizz would have 3 options in this instance; formats (a standard already used by the vast majority of physical card games when faced with is problem), crazy power-creep (screws over old players and forces new players to buy many more cards than standard will), or excessive bannings/nerfings of cards (basically the same impact as a power-creep).

You will still be able to, as a f2p player, get into the game. In fact, it will be significantly easier to do so. Rotation is long enough that you will have plenty of time to build up a competitive deck, getting many cards from a few sets is much easier than getting a few cards from many sets, and decreased power-level due to fewer cards leads to more lower-rarity cards being played. 

And if you dislike Standard, you can always just play the format that is what HS was already becoming -- Wild.",2016-02-03 16:06:07+00:00,czmcw1r,1.0,t3_440dxh,771.0,hearthstone

2085,"The upcoming prerelease event for the new set Oath of the Gatewatch would be a good place to start getting into events at your local game store. They are pretty casual events, but do help you get to know the store and the people to who play there as well as get some sense for how more competitive events are run. 

Prereleases are sealed events, meaning that you get 6 sealed booster packs to build a 40 card deck from (the store provides basic lands). Because of this, everybody will be on fairly equal ground. And because the set so new, most people will not know the cards very well. So it's a great event for (re)beginners. 

After the prerelease, you can decide how you want to keep playing. The major ways that I'd suggest are drafting at your local store, attending Friday Night Magic events, and/or attending more competitive events like GPs.

For information and advice on strategy and what cards/decks are good, www.mtgtop8.com , www.mtggoldfish.com , and www.channelfireball.com are all great resources.

2131,"New heroes:

- **Rexxar:** He's an okay bruiser that's fairly difficult to play. No huge impact on HL or competitive meta, but a perfectly reasonable pick.

- **Morales (aka: medic):** She's a strong single-target healer with no escape or self-heal. Even after being buffed, she's still one of the worse healers for HL and competitive.

- **Artanis:** A bruiser that is extremely weak in the early game, but gets a huge power-spike at lvl 16 in the form of a small charge on one of his abilities. He has no relevance in competitive and little in HL.

- **Cho'Gall (no, this is not a joke):** A hero controlled by two players; one controlling movement and has some warrior-style abilities, while the other, Gall, has the majority of the damage dealing abilities and can give Cho a small speed boost. He was originally awful (although even then he was played once or twice in competitive to varying degrees of success), but has since seen significant buffs and may now be a reasonable pick given that there is proper communication between the players.

- **Lunara:** A DoT ranged assassin with fast, bouncy movement.  Still probably too new to evaluate for HL or competitive, but she seems fairly weak.

Balance Changes:

- Zeratul and Leoric were both heavily nerfed, resulting in zera becoming very bad Leoric becoming just okay.

- Gathering Power was changed (buffed?) to 2% per kill, but all stacks lost on death and is now a decent pick on some heroes that it wasnt before picked on (KT and Naz to name a few).

- Many warriors were buffed, most notably ETC and Diablo. ETC is now fairly playable.

- There was a huge change in how the scaling works so that now heroes mostly reflect their higher-lvl stats at lower lvls. This change made Diablo extremely good.

- Tass' shield cooldown was reduced and is stronger on allies, but weaker on himself. His archon was also nerfed significantly. He's now pretty good and can even solo heal in a pinch.

- Tyrande's shadowstalk was changed to give a huge team heal and she's now probably the best hero in the game and can even solo heal.

- Tyrael saw a good amount of play to great effect at a somewhat recent tournament through the use of his Sanctification, but the scaling changes seem to have hit him hard.

Maps:

- Haunted Mines is no longer in rotation for HL or QM, but can still be played in custom games

2170,"&gt; It's immoral to eat animals because it's immoral to kill and cause unnecessary pain and suffering.

It's clearly not ""unnecessary"". And anyways, they are animals, not humans. Those are rules of morality that apply to humans; broadening them to apply to all creatures is a blatant mistake.

&gt;It's immoral to eat animals because we don't need to eat animals to survive.

No we don't, but the vast majority of people like to, and it is by far the most natural diet for humans.

&gt;It's immoral to eat animals because the animal agriculture industry is destroying the earth faster than anything else. 

Firstly, just about anything we do as far as the large-scale production of food is concerned will damage the environment in some way. Secondly, this cloning is clearly progress in the right direction in this regard.

&gt;It's immoral to eat animals because the food we give to livestock could feed the entire worlds starving population

You could say that about many luxury industries, so unless you're advocating for complete equality in every regard, this argument is mostly void.

&gt;It's immoral to eat animals because animals are not our property.

Yes they are...

**Indirect Answers** - Play cards that gain you card advantage to make up for the card advantage that you lose when outburst is played. Examples are [[den protector]] [[greenwarden of murasa]] [[read the bones]] and [[sign in blood]]

**Answer the strategy, not the card** - If your opponent plays cards like planar outburst, he will naturally have a more controlling deck. Make your deck more aggressive by playing more cheap efficient creatures and fewer late game cards. The general strategy here is Aggro &gt; Control &gt; Midrange &gt; Aggro

**Playstyle Changes** - Play your hand more conservatively. Don't play more creatures than you need to.

2339,"The games are similar in many aspects; deck archetypes are the same (control, combo, aggro, midrange) and several decks have fairly direct parallels between the games (Face hunter = Monored Aggro, etc.)

The main difference is the mana system. In mtg, your mana is in your deck in the form of lands. Each turn, you can play up to one land from your hand. You can ""tap"" lands (turn them sideways to represent this) which adds a mana to your mana pool (your mana pool is not represented in any way in game, and mana in it rarely sticks around for long enough for ingame representation to be necessary). You can use that mana in your mana pool to cast spells (in mtg, everything except lands, including creatures, are spells when you cast them). A tapped land in mtg is basically an empty mana crystal; it has already been used been used for the turn. (To see if you understand this, look at [[rampant growth]] and see if you recognize its parallel from hearthstone.)

In mtg your turn is divided into a few steps and phases; Untap, Upkeep, Draw, Main 1, Combat, Main 2, End. Your Untap step is when you untap all your tapped permenants. The upkeep has no specific meaning other than that it is when several cards' triggered abilities trigger (for example [[smothering abomination]]) Your main phases are the time in which you can play lands and cast the majority of spells (Instants and cards with ""flash"" can be cast at any time you have priority, including on your opponent's turn). Your end step is when you discard down to the 7 card maximum hand size.

Combat is also a big difference, creatures can only attack your opponent, not their creatures. Then your opponent chooses how or if they want to block those creatures with theirs.

In case you aren't aware, the prerelease is a ""limited event"" in that you build a deck from what you get from several booster packs (similar to Arena, though a draft is more similar). You will get 6 packs of Battle for Zendikar as well as one foil promo rare or mythic. From that you build your deck.",2015-09-24 15:53:10+00:00,cvcnsgt,1.0,t3_3m7gm3,2715.0,magicTCG

Or the Magic Origins Clash Pack (Clash packs are 2 decks rather than one, and are meant to be faced against eachother, however, they are also designed in such a way that the decks can be combined into a single, stronger deck that is roughly the same power-level as an event deck)

Boosters are not the best way to get cards. It's best to just buy cards you need individually.

c) 

The legendary rule only comes into effect if ***one player*** controls both of the legendary.

Planeswalkers

An upcoming rule that will be implemented with the prerelease of Battle for Zendikar is that if you mulligan at least once, you scry 1 at the beginning of the game.

d)

Standard rotation is coming up in just a few weeks.

There is a new format (new being a relative term; it's been around for 5 or so years) called modern. It includes all cards printed in standard-legal sets since 8th edition / original Mirrodin.

2471,"Ancestral Recall is debatably the strongest card ever printed (competing with black lotus and the moxen). Drawing 3 cards for 1 mana is so absurdly overpowered it's not even remotely comparable to any of the others in its cycle. Just look at cards like [[Treasure Cruise]] (which is banned or restricted in every format but standard after completely warping the modern modern meta and having a huge impact on legacy and vintage) or [[Jace's Ingenuity]] (which would played in most standard control list if it weren't for Dig through time and Sphinx's Rev existing at the same time) for some perspective. 

Dark ritual is also an overpowered card. For similar reasons to lotus and the moxen, though to a much lesser degree. Fast mana is *very* strong.

Lightning bolt is a slightly overpowered card. Most red decks that have it as an option will play it, as 3 damage for 1 mana is often too good to pass up. 

Giant growth is a perfectly balanced to slightly weak card; in the right standard environment can be playable, and it serves as the standard for how powerful green combat tricks should be.

Healing Salve is laughable. When you cast it targeting yourself, you had no impact on the board for 1 mana. When you cast it on a creature, you maybe get a 1-for-1 trade, but even that's not certain and it requires you to be reactive, making it essentially a dead card until something occurs.",2015-09-12 03:17:03+00:00,cuynui8,5.0,t1_cuym89y,3587.0,magicTCG

2533,"&gt;So in our best case world, one scalding tarn expedition is the result of 100 boxes opened, at a maximum. That is so much rarer than the chance of a foil set that a mere 20$ increase in price is hopelessly optimistic.

This is simply not correct. The odds of pulling any individual foil is equal to the odds of pulling any other individual foil, regardless of rarity. Just look at *any* in-demand foil from a recent set to see that they can't support that price. And that they are printed far more commonly than that.

In addition to that, the ZEN foil tarn is not at all a reasonable comparison for the following reasons. Firstly: a card that has not been in print for a few years, leading to both higher demand *and* lower supply. Secondly: it was in a set that was openend significantly less than recent sets. And thirdly: has always had

&gt;This deck ramps fast, but it still doesn't gain significant momentum until T3-5. Is that too slow?

Yes. Modern is a format where you need to be doing something impactful every turn, and the early turns are especially important.

Secondly, you can't expect to have your ramp uncontested. A more realistic gameplan is that you get your early creatures killed, have a bunch of extremely expensive cards stuck in your hand, and get run over.

Thirdly. Your deck is 64 cards. Is there any reason for this? Also, your manabase is abysmal and you aren't playing any U/G staples.

Fourthly, you have *no* interaction in your deck...

In addition to this, caustic caterpillar is not nearly enough to deal with affinity. Infinite reflection is *far* too slow to deal with splinter twin (and really doesn't stop them in any way as far as I can tell...). Jund will out-tempo you. You have no interaction to deal with tron, they will run you over. Basilisk collar is not nearly enough to stop burn.

2730,"&gt;Are there any types of cards that are must-haves in any kind of deck? Draw power? Removal? What kinds of cards should universally be included in decks?

Most decks run some form of creature removal.

&gt;What are artifacts? How crucial are they?

Artifacts are just another type of permanent (any object that stays in the battlefield after being cast is a permanent. Creatures, enchantments, and planeswalkers are all permanents). Artifacts are very similar to enchantments. The main differences are that they are usually colorless and usually have activated abilities that require tapping and/or sacrificing them, whereas enchantments are usually colored and typically have static abilities or activated abilities that don't require tapping or sacrificing. Artifacts are fairly essential to the game, but are not necessary in every deck and vary wildly in both playability and which decks want them based on what they do.

&gt;What's a solid number of land cards to include in a deck? I know most decks focus on two types of lands, but should others be included as well? How many?

A good starting number is 24 (with 36 no land cards). More aggressive decks with lower-costed cards can play as few as 18-22 lands, while control decks that need to make every land drop to keep up with their opponent need to play as many as 28. If you are building a multicolor deck, try to stick to at most 3 colors, use nonbasic lands like [[sandsteppe citadel]], [[temple of plenty]], [[blossoming sands]], [[windswept heath]], and [[caves of koilos]] to make sure that you can cast all of your cards reliably.

&gt;Is there someplace online that has ALL the definitions for the card terminology? i.e. Scy, Delve, Bestow, etc?

www.mtgsalvation.com should have all of the definitions and probably has a list of them all somewhere (Ill edit a link into this comment when I find it).

&gt;When a card has multiple...functions on it, does that only one can be activated before it's used up?

Do you have an example of what you're referring to?

To learn to play, I would strongly suggest getting the recently released Magic Duels: Origins game from steam. It has a tutorial that is fantastic for newer players. If you don't have steam or a pc or for some other reason don't have access to the game, Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014 is compatible with more devices and has a similar tutorial.

&gt;How did you go about starting your MTG hobby?

I started playing casually with friends after buying a Return to Ravnica intro pack, then left for a bit and really got into it after playing in the Khans of Tarkir prerelease.

&gt;Where should I start?

Start by getting the Magic Duels: Origins  or Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014 app to get a feel for the rules and playing (they are both free), then buying either the Dragons of Tarkir Event Deck or the Magic: Origins Clash Pack and taking the deck to FNM (friday night magic).

&gt;How should i build a deck and collect cards?

The most cost-efficient way is to buy individual cards you want from sites like www.tcgplayer.com, but as a new player you also need a starting point, and unless you are willing to pay $200+ for a complete competitive deck, preconstructed decks are good for that purpose.

&gt;What do new cards mean to the community and the game?

They will shake up the meta significantly, really that's the only impact it has.

2845,"1) Yes, it's very similar. Instead of 3 cards each time, everybody opens a 15 card pack, picks a card, and passes the remaining cards to the player next to him or her. Then this is repeated until the packs are empty. This is repeated again for 2 more packs. In the end you will have about 45 cards, and decks are 40 cards with about 17 of those being lands that are provided.

2) You get all of the cards you opened, and possibly some other prizes. Overall it's still good value as you are paying only a bit more than you would normally pay for that many packs.

3) Yes.

4) Don't be hesitant, if you want to try it out just go and let people know that you're new to the game. Also, don't be afraid to call a judge if you have a question or if you're not sure about a ruling. It's what they're there for.",2015-07-15 21:46:27+00:00,ct4n6um,1.0,t3_3dfdrb,2870.0,magicTCG

2847,"1) It depends on the format: if you're playing any type of constructed, you play with a single 60 card deck and 15 card sideboard for the entire event.

If it's a limited tournament (sealed or draft), you build your deck there from packs accordingly.

2) You can't switch decks. You can, however, switch out cards from your sideboard into your mainboard between games within a match (though not before matches).

3) 60 cards, limit of 4 of any individual cards except basic lands.

Standard is the most popular format, and likely what you will be playing at FNM. You may only have cards printed within the following sets in your deck: Theros, Born of the Gods, Journey into Nyx, M15, Khans of Tarkir, Fate Reforged, Dragons of Tarkir, and Magic: Origins. Standard rotates periodically.

In modern, which is the second most likely format, you may use any cards printed within sets since 8th edition.

For some context, [this](https://i.imgur.com/Qm1HkVc.png) is what the front page looked like yesterday night, just before going private. 
TL;DR of the issue is; About a month ago, a pro player, Zach Jesse, who was on camera at a pro tournament when another pro, Drew Levin, decided to look up some info on him. Levin discovered a decade-old sex assault charge. He then decided to tweet this fact spurring a huge controversy about whether felons and other criminals should be allowed to play. Now, a month after that, Zach Jesse is banned out of nowhere (he also had his online account with thousands of dollars worth of cards seized) and this ban caused a larger controversy (it was less about defending felons and more about the ethics and circumstances behind the ban) than the first, taking over the entire subreddit.",2015-07-03 16:32:47+00:00,csr476e,1.0,t3_3bxjyu,59979.0,SubredditDrama
2920,"Let me preface this by saying, I do think that a blanket ban of all sex offenders/felons from at least competitive play might not be a bad idea on Wizards/Hasbro's part. They are a company and having this be the face of competitive play is obviously bad. That said, I strongly disagree with this particular ban. 

The controversy is about the ethics behind the ban, rather than a defense of of Jesse himself, and it seems to boil down to a few major points:

- First of all, they decide to ban only a single person, despite there no doubt being several more who have committed similar offenses. This makes it seem all the more ethically suspect, and casts some doubt on their supposed reasoning for the ban.

- Secondly, the ban clearly only occurred because of the controversy surrounding him, not because of the actual crime he committed.

- And finally, the ban has done more harm than good, by essentially making a magority of the vocal playerbase seemingly defend sex offenders.",2015-07-03 02:36:59+00:00,csqlg65,3.0,t1_csql62c,561.0,magicTCG

- Banning Zach Jesse is wrong because he's already served a sentence, and isn't a danger to society in the eyes of the law, so why should Wizards think he is a danger to other players?

- Banning Zach Jesse sets an uncomfortable precedent that could be used to justify banning players like Patrick Chapin for trafficking ecstasy 15 years ago

Not nearly any creature, it's actually fairly restrictive. The card is fine

&gt;Incredibly good removal against nearly anything pre-turn 4. Still unbelievably powerful late game simply on account of how cheap it is.

[[deathmark]]

&gt;Ironically this is probably the weakest of the five, but still 5 damage to a creature for 1 mana. 5 damage to anything with defender + blocking = kill most walls, so this might as well be oracled to ""ruin target control player's day.""

The last time a control deck actually played a wall was [[wall of omens]]. This is *awful* against a control deck. It's a balanced card.

&gt;One mana to destroy a blue creature with flying already makes this card disgustingly powerful, but a creature with flying with CMC less than or equal to the number of forests you control essentially makes this an instant must-have in any green ramp deck. Super, super broken.

Hardly broken in any way. Green already has plummet, which sees very little play.

&gt;Hard counterspells (i.e. counterspells which do not have an escape clause) should always cost at least UU.

That is blatantly false. See: Essence Scatter, Disdainful Stroke, Negate, Dispel, etc.

&gt;UU. Also, this essentially reads ""counter any legendary creature spell for one mana,"" which is indescribably broken.

Again, that is not broken, though this is likely the most powerful card in the cycle. It is also probably broken, but that's because of the three modes other than ""legendary"".

**TL;DR**: Please learn to evaluate cards before posting critique. Nearly all of what you said is just incorrect. And remember, just because a card is good doesn't make it broken.

The first card milled has a 1/15 chance to be bomb. That means that the next card milled has a ((14/15)*(2/29)) + ((1/15)*(1/29)) (which turns out to be 29/435) chance to be a bomb. After that, the next card has a 210/3045 (I can write out the math for that if you would like) chance to be a bomb.

3152,"The most important thing to think about is what format you want to play. This will dictate which cards can be legally used. I would suggest standard as it's debatably the easiest format to get into; it includes only cards printed in the 5-8 most recent sets. Currently Theros, Born of the Gods, Journey into Nyx, M15, Khans of Tarkir, Fate Reforged, and Dragons of Tarkir.

After this, decide on an archetype; aggro, midrange, control, or combo.

- Aggro is all about winning as fast as possible with cards that deal direct damage like [[lightning strike]] and aggressive creatures like [[monastery swiftspear]] and [[goblin rabblemaster]]. It mostly runs low-cost cards.

- Midrange focuses on playing a balance of efficient creatures like [[siege rhino]] and [[whisperwood elemental]] as well as removal spells like [[hero's downfall]]. It plays cards from many mana costs, though it focuses on the 3-4 mana range.

- Control, as the name implies, controls the game with removal and counterspells. While building an incremental advantage through draw spells like [[dig through time]] and [[jace's ingenuity]] until it can play a practically unkillable ""finisher"" like [[silumgar, the drifting death]] or [[pearl lake ancient]]. It plays a lot of cards at the 2-4 mana cost range as well as a few 5+ cost finishers and draw spells.

- Combo wins through exploiting the interaction between 2 or more cards. For example [[splinter twin]] and [[deciever exarch]] or [[jeskai ascendancy]], [[retraction helix]], a creature, and [[tormod's crypt]] (this is the only combo that is somewhat viable in standard). The build of a combo deck depends greatly on the combo itself.

After this, build based on the ""rule of 9"". Which is, pick 9 cards you think will fit well together in a deck, buy 4 copies of each (www.tcgplayer.com is a good place to buy individual cards) and then put 24 lands of the fitting colors. This number of lands can vary a bit, control wants a few more, and aggro functions better with fewer.

Then test your deck a bit and make modifications.",2015-06-17 18:53:05+00:00,cs9ulqt,1.0,t3_3a6xkk,1287.0,magicTCG
