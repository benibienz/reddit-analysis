It had everything; a good number of playable cards, support for non-midrange strategies, playable aggressive red cards, great flavor, a decent limited environment, and most impressive of all, it managed to maintain a diverse healthy standard even with eight sets in the format.

___________

**Creatures:**

**4x Toolcraft Exemplar:**  
*Gives the deck the aggressive start that it needs. Between Copter and Servo Exhibition, this is fairly reliably swinging for 3 on turn 2.*

**4x Selfless Spirit:**   
*A deck that goes as wide as this needs some protection against mass removal. This is a card that you're happy to see on turn 2 as much as you are on turn 9. I tried playing fewer for more 2-drop artifacts, but the deck performed significantly worse against control and midrange.*

**4x Smuggler's Copter:**  
*This card well exceeded my expectations. It's almost always swinging for 3 in the air on turn 3, and avoids quite a bit of removal. In addition to that, it can help you reach 4-5 mana more easily or loot away excess lands. Great card to use to curve into Glint-Sleeve or Pia. The fact that it's a 2-drop artifact also really helps with Toolcraft.*

**3x Pia Nalaar:**  
*This card is, as expected, quite good. A 2/2 and a 1/1 flyer is already a great deal, but in addition it gives you great utility. The incidental damage of the first ability is fairly good, but it's the last ability that truly makes this card shine. I can't tell you how many games I've won just from that ability. The legendary tag is a very real downside in a deck like this, though, so I had to cut down to 3 copies.*

**2x Glint-Sleeve Artisan:**  
*Bear with me on this one. While this guy may not look like much, but between the flexibility, the multiple bodies, the vanilla statline, and the fact that it gives you an artifact, I think that this card has a real spot in standard. While he's no Pia, he still lines up very well against the other 3-drops of the format.*

**3x Angel of Invention:**  
*This card is simply ridiculous. Firstly, it gives you three bodies with a total of 6/5 stats (there are some situations where you want the 4/3, but they seem fairly rare). When you're losing, this gives you 3 bodies to block with and some lifegain. When you're already winning, the anthem often just wins you the game on the spot, and when you're at parity, this card lets all your creatures break through. When you get to 5 mana, 99% of the time you play this card and win the game.*

**Planeswalkers:**

**2x Chandra, Torch of Defiance:**  
*While she's not quite as strong as I had hoped for, that's really not saying much. All of her abilities are relevant, and she does practically whatever you need, when you need it. She just doesn't do quite enough for the game plan, and is just a bit too expensive to play too many copies.*

**3x Gideon, Ally of Zendikar:**  
*Whether you're building a board, swinging for for 5, or making all your creatures massive, Gideon is always incredible. As much as I want to be running four of him, I have a hard time justifying 6 four-drops. Cutting a Chandra may be the right choice.*

**Spells:**

**4x Servo Exhibition:**   
*Not the most exciting card, but exactly the kind of efficient filler card that this deck needs.*

**2x Declaration in Stone:**  
*One of the most efficient removal spells in standard. It gets rid of annoying blockers at any point of the game. The 2-drop slot was crowded though, and this ended up getting cut down to only two copies.*

**4x Galvanic Bombardment:**  
*With Fiery Impulse rotating, this seemed like the go-to cheap removal spell for red, and it hasn't disappointed me so far.*

**Land**

4x Inspiring Vantage

3x Needle Spires

9x Mountain

9x Plains

**WIP Sideboard**

3x Lathnu Hellion

2x Master Trinketeer

2x Thraben Inspector

1x Authority of the Consuls

2x Thalia, Heretic Cathar

1x Reckless Bushwhacker

2x Fragmentize

2x Incendiary Flow

#Basic Strategy

______________

The basic idea of the deck is to build a large board of difficult-to-remove creatures and attack aggressively. You're playing a strategy somewhere between that of aggro and midrange, leaning towards one or the other depending on the matchup. You can usually get in enough damage early, while simultaneously building up quite a few creatures that it is difficult for midrange and control players to get a hold on the game. The early turns are crucial. While toolcraft is important, having a 2-drop to play is more-so. You should mulligan aggressively for one if it's not in your opening hand. Your goal against aggro should be to play slightly defensive; your late-game is better than theirs, and you can afford to miss a few swings and trade a few creatures if that means gaining board control for turns 3-5. Against midrange, you should play aggressively and exploit their more awkward manabase. The goal here is to establish early control of the board and get in a bit of early damage. If you can become the aggressor early, you'll be able to outrace their 1-for-1 removal and threats. If you can't easily play the aggressor, your chances of winning are hurt, but you can still regain control of the game with your walkers and small suite of removal. Control is the easiest matchup. The exact strategy depends largely on the exact variety of control deck you're facing, but the general strategy is mull very aggressively and dump your hand early.

#Matchups

____________

U(x) Eggs/Cheerios - Very Favorable (Honestly, the deck is a joke. I'm not exaggerating in saying that I've only lost one full match to the deck, and I've played quite a matches against quite a few variants, from monoU to UR to a weird Bant version.)

GR Energy Aggro - 50/50 

Other assorted red-based aggro - Favorable 

GB(r) Delerium - Favorable 

Temurge - Very Unfavorable 

Bant Midrange - Slightly Favorable 

Zombies - Unfavorable 

WB Control - Favorable 

UW(b) Control - Favorable 

UB Control - Slightly Favorable  

#Conclusion

____________

While this may end up not being a tier 1 deck, given its mostly poor matchups against midrange, I do think that it's the best of the artifact aggro decks that people have been testing. I tried WB, I tried Mardu, I tried playing equipment, I tried playing a lower curve and Bushwhacker, but this came out on top. If you're testing, I think this a deck to at least keep in mind. Play those Kozilek's Returns and Ishkanahs if you aren't already.

T: Add C to your mana pool.  
4, T, Sac ~: Search your library for artifact card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library. Activate this ability only if you control three or more artifacts.

_____________

Lifegain on lands has always been a pretty strong effect for control decks (we've seen Radiant Fountain see a decent amount of play in the past), as are utility lands with big payoffs late game. This has the potential to gain you quite a bit of life at very little cost, and the ability to tutor at such a low opportunity cost seems quite strong depending on what artifacts Kaladesh brings. 

I'm mostly excited for its potential in standard; assuming we get enough artifacts and synergy it could get very scary, but I also think it has some place modern. I definitely see it seeing play in Lantern Control, and I could even see Affinity having it in the board for aggressive matchups, though that might be a bit of a stretch.

Please don't link his youtube channel or videos in this thread. I just think that this is a legitimate issue that needs to be discussed.

DesolatorMagic, for those who haven't heard of him, is a mtg youtuber who puts out content on a fairly regular basis. While I can appreciate the need for a diverse mtg community, all it takes is watching one of his videos to see that the channel is blatantly toxic and alarmist. Even that alone isn't really an issue though. The real problem lies in the fact that the channel is geared toward new players, and based on comments and views (his videos get 5-15k viewers each) it does a good job of capturing that audience. It's concerning to me that for many newer players, this is their first exposure to the community, and this is who they are looking to for mtg content.

It's not comprehensive, but it should cover all the terms that I see misused here on a daily basis.

_____________________

**Card Advantage/Value:** Card advantage is what decides the winner of many games, especially involving midrange decks. It is the change in the number of cards that a player has access to, both in their hand and on the battlefield. Whenever you play a card, you are immediately costing yourself a card's worth of value. Most cards make up for this by doing something to regain you that value, or even net you positive value by doing one of the following things; creating a minion, gaining a card in hand, or destroying an opponent's minion. Some examples of high value cards (most of which are very slow in terms of tempo) are Sprint (4-for-1), Ball of Spiders (6-for-1!), The Curator (potentially a 4-for-1), and Varian Wrynn (4-for-1).

____________________________

**X-for-1:** This is a way of simply describing a card's value (effect on a player's state of card advantage). The ""-for-1"" part refers to the cost in card advantage of playing the card, while the number at the beginning is the number of cards worth of value that you gain. Not all cards can be easily classified using this method, as the amount of card advantage they generate is variable: for example, Fire Elemental is usually a 2-for-1, as it gives you a body on the board as well as destroying an enemy minion with its battlecry. But when its battlecry doesn't destroy a minion, it ends up being only a 1-for-1. Some other examples of this are Shiv, North Sea Kraken, BGH, Gorehowl, and Troggzor.

______________________________


**Tempo:** Tempo is the rate a player gains their boardstate and spends their resources relative the the rate that an opponent gains a boardstate and spends their resources. Every time you play a card that affects the board, you are gaining tempo. The higher an impact that a card has relative to its cost, disregarding the impact it has on either player's card advantage, the more tempo it gains you. Some examples of high tempo cards are: Innervate, Sap, Succubus, Prep, Defias Ringleader, Sinister Strike, and Cho'Gall. There is a special case: Overload. In the short term, it gains you tempo by allowing you to gain a relatively larger boardstate faster, but instead of having a cost to make up for it in the form of losing card advantage, as most high-tempo cards do, it actually costs you tempo in your next turn. This means that despite looking like tempo cards, Overload cards actually lose you net tempo. Face Healing and Face Damage also fall under the umbrella of tempo, because while they don't directly impact either player's board, they *do* make a player's boardstate relatively more or less threatening, effectively making it stronger.

___________________________

**Cantrip/Cycling:** A spell that draws or creates a single card in addition to having a usually small effect. They are typically fairly cheap, but don't necessarily have to be. Cards like Purify, Shiv, Tracking, Mind Vision, and Novice Engineer are all cantrips. Cycling is the action of playing a cantrip.

___________________

**Discard:** Despite what Fel Reaver would lead you to believe, discarding only applies to when you lose cards directly from your hand.

__________________________

**Topdeck:** Some people seem to be under the odd impression that to ""topdeck a card"" means to draw a card that is perfect for a given situation. That's just not true. Saying that somebody topdecked a terrible card is perfectly valid. Despite what Kripp may try to tell you, any card can be topdecked, not just exactly what your opponent needed. ""Topdecking"", on the other hand, is a situation when a player is playing with no cards in hand, and basically just casting whatever's on top of their library each turn.

______________________________________

**Stricty Better:** A card that is the same as another in every way, except in areas in which its better. This doesn't take extreme corner-cases into account, and usually doesn't take fatigue into consideration (for example, loot hoarder would be strictly better than a vanilla 2/1).

__________________________________

That's basically it. Sorry if I came off as a bit of a condescending asshole; people using these terms incorrectly is a pet peeve of mine.

_________

I didn't see any discussion on this card in the large spoiler thread and think it has some standard potential. 

For starters, it has decent stats. It's not a 2/3 or 3/2, which is unfortunate in the current standard, but all the same, it passes the vanilla test.

It has a good mana-sink (3 mana for that effect at instant-speed is really efficient) that also happens to allow you to do something on a turn and still flip it the next upkeep.

The flip side is great as well. It gives it competitive stats and has a very good effect for creature-heavy decks if you can manage to flip it. 

It doesn't really fit into any current decks too well except perhaps Abzan variants, but any creature-heavy aggressive green decks seem like they should give this card some consideration.",spikes,[Spoiler] Duskwatch Recruiter,https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/44n3t2/spoiler_duskwatch_recruiter/

I wanted to make this post to address them.

1 - You did *not* lose value on buying older cards.

It doesn't matter if you spent $5 on cards or $6000, you got you money's worth. Competitive cards cycle out of the meta regardless of having a true rotation. We already saw this happening, and there is really nothing that Blizz would be able to do stop this other than just stop printing new sets (obviously that's a horrible idea). The meta changes. That's a fact. And so will the meta cards. Adding standard doesn't make this any more true, just more apparent. And if they *hadn't* added formats to this game, they would have had to resort to excessive nerfs or power-creep, which would make your cards irrelevant just as fast, if not faster. So while you *did* put money into meta cards, those cards were never safe, regardless of Standard.

2 - Wild is *not* much, if any, more expensive than normal HS would have been to get into.

People are pointing to them no longer selling packs or adventures as making Wild more expensive, but realistically, as more sets get released, the playable cards will eventually become so spread out between all of the sets, that even if old sets' packs *were* availible, it would not be realistic or efficient to buy those packs to acquire cards from them. As for adventures, the fact that they are craftable, and perhaps more importantly, disenchantable, will make it much easier to get lower-rarity cards from them, and even will make it easier to get higher-rarity cards from the later wings. Finally, the fact that standard exists means that new players have a place to play somewhat competitively for a while before getting enough of a collection to get into Wild.",hearthstone,Addressing some points of concern,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4460fw/addressing_some_points_of_concern/

**Creatures**:

*4 Deathmist* - First Half of the Megamorph Package; is a solid attacker and blocker. Great against midrange's bigger threats and decent against aggro in due to its recursion.

*4 Den Protector* - Second half of the Megamorph Package; I don't know what to say about it other than that this card is pure value and one of the best 3 or 5-drops in standard.

*4 Eldrazi Displacer* - I love everything about this card. Began with it as a 2-of in testing and gradually increased it to being a 4-of because of just how effective it is at doing... everything. Just a few examples of uses for it are: Flicker a manifested Gideon, Wingmate, land, or silkwrap, Getting 2 of Gideons abilities in one turn, getting another 3/4 flier, flickering thought-knot, destroying a token, destroying a hangarback, removing an attacker from combat, flickering one of your blockers to allow it to survive combat. The list goes on, but suffice it to say, this card is really, really good and even comes with a decent body.

*2 Matter Reshaper* - I've been impressed by this card, but I've also been *really* disappointed. I think it's good enough to warrant a spot over the other 3-drops of the format, but between its unreliability and the number of other 3-drops I'm already playing, I think it being a 1-2-of is plenty.

*3 Thought-Knot Seer* - This card is awesome. It has a solid body, helps in the Ramp matchup, and gives you (temporary) card-advantage. It always just feels very strong when played.

*3 Wingmate Roc* - I've noticed that a lot of decks have mostly moved away from flyers, so Wingmate Roc helps finish out a lot of games. The incidental lifegain is nice as well. I tried Linvala over this for a while, but I think the fact that this card comes out a turn over makes it the stronger option.

**Enchantments**:

*2 Mastery of the Unseen* - A nice 2-drop that helps keep you in the game and provides much-needed card-advantage later. Also helps with recurring Deathmist and has some synergy with Eldrazi Displacer.

*3 Frontier Siege* - I know this is a bit of an odd choice, but it allows you to do *way more* after turn 4 with your mana sinks and just by playing cards. You can cast a 3-drop, a 4-drop, and hold up mana for a D-command turn 5 after casting this. This, along with Displacer and/or Mastery is what gives you the advantage over other midrange decks.

*2 Silkwrap* - Firstly, there are a lot of good targets for Silkwrap currently. Between manadorks, Jace, Hangarback, and all the aggressive creatures being played. Secondly, this deck is low on turn 2 plays against aggresive decks. This fills that gap.

**Spell(s)**:

*3 Dromoka's Command* - This card is a fantastic removal spell for only 2 mana that occasionally hits a silkwrap or stasis snare. When you play this, you will almost always win combat, and just holding up the mana for it is threatening enough to occasionally deter attacks from your opponent.

**Planeswalkers**:

*3 Gideon* - I don't think I need to say much or anything to defend this card choice. 

*1 Nissa, Voice of Zendikar* - I'm not hugely impressed by her, but occasionally she does win games. Her + is sometimes enough to stall against aggro, and her - is good when you need it. I'm never that disappointed to be playing her turn 3 instead of another of the 3 drops, so for now, she's staying in.

**Lands**:

*2 Canopy Vista*

*6 Forest*

*6 Plains*

*5 Forest*

*4 Windswept Heath*

*1 Caves of Koilos*

*1 Llanowar Wastes*

*3 Blighted Steppe* - A source of colorless with a nice upside. 

*4 Crumbling Vestige* - This card has been great for me. It doesn't play as awkwardly as it looks, and is a great way to fix my mana in the early game and fix my colorless a bit later. If you need to play an early thought-knot or Matter Reshaper, you can play this on turn 1 or 2 without causing any real issues.

**Sideboard**:

*2 Cleric of the Forward Order* - I like this card's stats a bit more than Arashin Cleric's in the aggro matchup

*2 Heir of the Wilds* - Anti-Aggro

*2 Nissa, Vastwood Seer* - Good for the stall-y matchups.

*1 Surge of Righteousness* - Anti-Aggro

*2 Evolutionary Leap* - Anti-Control / Midrange

*1 Mastery of the Unseen* - Another tool for the stall-y matchups. Sometimes 2 just isn't enough.

*4 Warping Wail* - This deck has a very rough game 1 against ramp. And while I can't defend playing even one of these in the mainboard, this is the card that's needed to beat ramp. It ideally counters their ramp spell and kills their manadorks long enough to let me get a board-presence and kill them.

____________

**Matchups**:

Aggro: This is a mediocre matchup, but becomes much better after sideboarding. There are enough good blockers (deathmist, reshaper, gideon, nissa) to prevent death for the first few turns, if they get a good board of their own within the first 2-3 turns they do have the potential to just beat you.

Abzan - This has been a pretty favorable Matchup. You can just stall pretty much forever. Gideon, Rhino, and Reality Reshaper are the biggest threats, but can be dealt with pretty easily.

Jeskai (black) - Mediocre matchup. A bit more difficult to deal with than Abzan due to being less creature-based, but still a fine matchup. Dealing with the Mantis Riders is by far the most important part of this matchup, and you have a good amount of ways to do that.

Control - Not favorable; if they can safely play their Ojutai, you typically lose, but you do have plenty of ways to go under control, and if you can get a planeswalker out or start the megamorph machine going, you're in a good spot.

Ramp - Game one is absolutely terrible, save for a bad draw on the part of ramp. They can just drop their ulamog or ugin and there's not a whole lot you can do to stop it. Second and third game you bring in the Warping Wails and some of the more aggressive cards and you have a fighting chance, but you have to make very aggressive plays; I've found that playing Den Protector face-up turn 2 can even be the right choice a good portion of the time.

This card just seems absurdly powerful. I don't know enough about modern to know if this would fit into any decks, but on its own, it's a fairly cheap creature with decent stats that is (almost) always 2-for-1, and potentially gets you a free card. That seems strong enough to find a spot somewhere. 

For standard I think it's almost  certain that this card will see play, just due to its sheer power level. I could definitely see it finding a spot in Abzan, Jeskai, Mardu, and/or Rally. It has plenty of targets in all of those decks (even just hitting a land or drawing a noncreature spell isn't awful).",spikes,[Spoiler] Matter Reshaper,https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/3zw0cs/spoiler_matter_reshaper/

This card just seems really solid. I don't know exactly which decks it would fit into, but the exile mode alone hits a lot of creatures, the counterspell hits some important spells and gives it a use in the late-game, and the scion mode is a good option to have when its needed.

I like it as a card more similar to [[Blighted Fen]] (at a much better rate) than to other manlands. It's clearly is a defensive card, and makes attacks very awkward for the opponent. That said, it's almost always going to die when it's activated, and has less-than-ideal stats for dealing with damage-based removal.

**Creatures**:

2 Den Protector - Last standard showed just how strong this card is. It's a very good 3 or 5 drop that adds a bit of resilience to the deck in the late game, and in a pinch can be played for 2 mana. Only a 2-of because the main game plan is aggro.

3 Drana, Liberator of Malakir - This is a kill-on-sight threat. If your opponent can't remove it immediately, the damage stacks up fast; winning in 2-3 turns. There's also some incedental synergy with Hangarback.

4 Forerunner of the Slaughter - On its own it's one of the weaker cards in the deck; but its versatility is nice, as it can be played as either a 3 or 2 drop with fairly aggressive stats.

4 Hangarback Walker - An incredibly efficient card, nearly an auto-include. It also has synergy with several cards in the deck.

4 Rakshasa Deathdealer - A resilient, aggressive threat. It blocks well, attacks well, and overall is a very strong card in an aggressive shell.

3 Shaman of the Great Hunt - After casting removal on turn 3, dropping this closes out the game quickly. Even if you can't safely attack with it, it changes the board.

4 Woodland Wanderer - This card has consistently impressed me. By turn 4 this should always be a 5/5. If you can drop it against aggro you probably win (it tramples over their usually smaller threats while also staying untapped to block them). It also beats rhino, tasigur, and most other midrange threats. Not as good against control as other cards in the deck, but it's still a big threat if they can't remove or counter it.

**Non-Creatures**:

3 Kolaghan's Command - always a 2-for-1 and expecially powerful against aggro. Not high-impact enough against Midrange to be able to justify a 4-of.

3 Murderous Cut - This was not in the original draft of the deck, but after losing repeatedly to bigger midrange threats in testing, I realized that I needed some hard removal. With no other delve in the deck, cut seemed like the best option. It has worked very well.

3 Painful Truths - Refills your hand after a fast start, or adds resiliency in the late game. Though it seemed like this card has gone somewhat under-the-radar, it is very powerful. Draw 3 for 3s are pretty powerful, even at sorcery-speed. The lifeloss is relevant, but the card advantage is worth it.

3 Roast - A solid removal spell that allows for good curves into Drana, Forerunner, or Shaman. 

**Lands**:

I tested mortuary mire, but it seemed too awkward with the latelands and too slow in the early-game. And I opted out of using Blighted Fen in favor of a more consistent start.

4 Bloodstained Mire

4 Wooded Foothills

1 Polluted Delta

4 Smoldering Marsh

4 Cinder Glade

4 Mountain

2 Swamp

1 Forest

**SB**:

3 Fiery Impulse - Good replacement for murderous cut vs aggro. 

2 Rending Volley - Kills Mantis Rider and most other Jeskai threats, depending on the meta this may or may not be in the final version of the SB.

3 Atarka's Command - When you have a matchup in which you need to be more aggressive, this helps.

2 Outpost Siege: Strong against control and aggro.

2 Self-Inflicted Wound - Against most variations of Abzan, this is a very strong card. Also deals well with Ojutai.

3 ?? - until the meta develops more I don't know what will go into this slot of the sideboard.

**Against Aggro**:

Aggro, you have to play the control deck. Burn their creatures and block with yours. This is a matchup where playing den protector for 2 may not be a bad idea, if you have no other 2-drops. Your main plan is to find your Woodland Wanderer and cast it before they kill you.

**Against Midrange:**

This is the deck's best matchup. Just play aggressively and you should be able to deal with their threats efficiently enough while pushing through enough damage that you win. Even if it does get to the late-game, recurring your hangarbacks and wanderers while removing and trading with their threats should give you a solid chance of winning.

**Against Control**:

This is probably the worst matchup. You have to get off to an aggressive start, and then once their removal and counters start to come into play, outvalue them with Painful Truths and Kolaghan's Command as well as playing 2 threats in a turn. If it gets to the late game you have probably lost (as is often the case against control).

**Final Thoughts**:

This deck clearly has room for improvement, but I do believe that with how consistently aggressive it is, some variation will be part of the meta. I'm sure that there are some cards that should be in the deck, and some that should be taken out, and suggestions as to what those might be would be greatly appreciated.

I was under the impression that foils were distributed the same as the set (for example, if there are 15 mythics and 50 rares in a 300 card set in which each pack contains a foil, roughly 15/300 packs would have a foil mythic, and 50/300 would have a foil rare). Meaning that any individual foil card is as common as any other, regardless of rarity. But other people seem convinced that there is a rarity-biased distribution. 

The debate around this fact has caused countless arguments with neither side ever being able to find a reliable source.",magicTCG,Distribution of foils by rarity.,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/3j16ga/distribution_of_foils_by_rarity/
