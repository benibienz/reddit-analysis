2,"I'm wondering if the **MSI Z170A Krait 3X** motherboard and **Samsung 850 EVO 500GB M.2(B+M)** are compatible? The board seems to use M.2(B), but since I'm not familiar with the whole socket differences can the Samsung M.2(B+M) be used in the slot? Thanks!",2016-11-17 06:38:12+00:00,da3wu72,1,t3_5d8u0a,66824,buildapc

4,Wow really? I wasn't too sure about using multiple/ultrawide monitors with the 1060 as I'm also looking into using it for more productivity. What CPU are you using to pair with it and also what kind of framerates are you getting? Thanks!,2016-11-15 00:04:02+00:00,da0jynh,2,t1_d9zt8gb,34249,buildapc

**Avant, Azami, Charlotte, Ciara, Ensa-Taya, Felice, Fizz, Galtier, Juno-Seto, Kalon, Krantz, Kulyuk, Mifunes, Rayla, Rengaku, Rize, Shura, Sirius, Six Starters, Vern, Zelnite, Viktor, Zero**  
Other noteable units include:  
**Allanon, Ark(not Omni cause I'm lazy and RNG), Quaid, Zenia**  
I have a variety of Omni's so I'm struggling picking my UoC. I was thinking between (in the order based on want) **Elza, Azurai, Zekt, or Lara** I'm all ears so it'll be nice to hear back! Thanks~",2016-11-13 02:14:49+00:00,d9xxamv,1,t3_58m8r6,1963511,bravefrontier
