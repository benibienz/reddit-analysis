I'm just wondering what the general satisfaction is from 1060 owners and of course any dissatisfaction, if any. Thanks~! 

**Update 1 (11/14/16)**: First of all I'm blown away with all these responses from you! Thank you very much! Just to clarify some things: I'm eventually looking for a dual monitor set up(most likely 1080p) for casual gaming on one monitor and productivity on another OR 1440p Ultrawide. However, this won't be likely until next year, but just putting it out there for reference about ""future proofing"". About gameplay, I'm looking to run a consistent 60+fps assuming the monitors will be 60hz. I'd ideally not have to upgrade the GPU for at least another 2 years. Also, I'd like to ask which component of the build be sacrificed first if you're looking to stay within a budget? Thanks again and I'll keep checking back!",buildapc,How satisfied are you with the GTX 1060?,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5cukkg/how_satisfied_are_you_with_the_gtx_1060/
