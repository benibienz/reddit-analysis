11,"Hmm. It's a good idea in theory but has a few issues in practice I reckon.

1. How would you make sure someone was actually 'injured'? Would be very easy to claim someone had a minor strain and couldn't bowl and replace them with a fresh new bowler. You can easily see how this would descend into something like ['bloodgate'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodgate) in rugby union.

2. There would have to be a rule about all substitutes being like-for-like, e.g. impossible to replace a seamer with a spinner because the pitch is turning more than you thought. But that comes with a whole load of issues. Firstly, does every team need a squad of 16 or so players to be on constant standby in a Test? Wouldn't work well for England, whose domestic comps run alongside Test matches, for example. Also, you could put in a like-for-like seamer such as Woakes for Finn halfway through a Test, but clearly Woakes is a much better batsman, so it seems a bit harsh on a team who has taken a big first-innings lead to then have much better batsmen to get out in the second innings.",2016-11-04 17:30:48+00:00,d9lr65i,1.0,t3_5b4mi2,2999.0,Cricket

I don't think the point is that Vince is an inherently bad player because of that statistic and that statistic only.

101,"http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/178/178471/f_Batting_by_Season.html

That's his F-C record. 2009, 2010, 2011, 2015 and 2016 have been the years he's spent in Division One, typically batting at four or five, and his record is poor. Admittedly the first few were at the beginning of his career, but I think you can make an exceptionally strong statistical case that says he is excellent in Division Two against average bowling attacks (and will thus probably do fairly well against SL), but is nowhere near as good against top county bowlers (so I expect him to struggle against Pakistan and crumble in India, where he's barely played.) 

I think it's also very difficult to say he 'looks right' as a number three unless you been to quite a lot of Championship cricket. Lots of player look good in the ECB's highlights packages, but how many times has Vince been really successful at three in red ball cricket when you've seen him? Even if you've been to every Hampshire game for years I find it hard to believe it's more than a handful.

213,"&gt; James Anderson is no good in South African or Australian conditions

In the past two Ashes series down under combined (2010/11 and 2013/14) he has 38 wickets at 32. Not exactly disastrous, especially given that includes the whitewash series. His last Test in South Africa was in January 2010, so I don't know how you can be so certain in saying he hasn't changed as a bowler since.

&gt; from what I've read he isn't exactly express

Don't know what you've been reading, Foottit is a 90mph left-armer. His downfall is inconsistency, not lack of pace.

&gt; Ballance, Bairstow and Stokes were there aswell.

Look at what I said - I used the first Test of each series as my example. In terms of members of the touring party, Cook, Broad, Anderson, Bairstow, Compton, Finn, Patel and Root were in the squad in India and in the SA one, whereas it was Cook, Anderson, Bairstow, Ballance, Broad, Finn, Root, Stokes for Australia. So eight players from each touring party. 

&gt; badly exposed EVERY SINGLE time

Presumably then if playing India and Sri Lanka at home doesn't count then we have a sample size of five matches? His Test debut in a dead rubber in Sydney, two games at home to NZ and two games at home to Australia? How can you judge someone's career on that only? Ballance probably won't even be at number three; judging by today's warm-up game, Compton is more likely to fill that position.

I am fine with you disputing that South Africa's form in India on tough pitches won't necessarily be the crucial factor in the series, but some of the stuff you are contesting is pretty tenuous.

214,"So much potential to be a good tournament but for the IPL and BBL bias and the ridiculous qualifying tournament. Seem to remember Hampshire one year lost their first game and were then automatically out. 

How about: send two teams from BBL, IPL, Ram Slam straight to group stage and winners of CPL, PSL, Blast, BPL, SLPL and Super Smash through as well. 

Then the runners-up of CPL, PSL, Blast, BPL, SLPL and Super Smash have a qualifying tournament with two groups of three. Bottom of each group is out, top two go through to group stage.

Group stage: Four groups of four. Top two in each group go through to quarter-finals. Then a straight knockout. Maximum games a team would play is eight, and that's if they come through the pre-tournament and reach the final.

216,"Morkel also took just one wicket against Bangladesh and had a poor home summer by his standards - think he averaged in the region of 35 with the ball.

I don't think your reasoning of 'in the hypothetical situation England had played on those pitches they would have done badly except for Cook' holds up any better than the reasoning in the article. 

Given that South Africa have dropped two of the three spinners mentioned, it's fair enough to trash them. Piedt hasn't shown anything as yet to suggest he's any better than Moeen, and spin won't play much of a part in the series.

If we're calling the England side that won in India in 2012 'completely different', how can you cite the 13/14 Ashes? Out of the team that played the Brisbane Test in that series, only four players are still in the squad: Cook, Root, Broad and Anderson. In fact, more players from the Ahmadabad Test in 2012 are still in the squad - Cook, Compton, Anderson, Samit, Broad. 

Do England not have a number three ""at all""? I think Gary Ballance's 47 average and Nick Compton's 1200 first-class runs last summer would beg to differ.

The article basically says South Africa's batsmen are bang out of form - undeniable with the exception of AB, who will have the strain of keeping wicket as well - and that their seamers aren't the force they used to be, so England's chances are a lot higher than the bookies are saying.

My main point is simply that compared to Ballance (who, let's remember, has a 47 average in Tests), Compton (probably one of the only players to have consistently got as many runs as Hildy in the past few seasons), and Taylor (who I rate very highly), he's not worth selecting in the Test squad, and that LVCC runs don't guarantee success. Of course, they are a decent indication, but remember selections by England of people like Trescothick, who didn't necessarily score thousands of first-class runs, but looked the part. 

And re Lyth and Bairstow - I am convinced Bairstow is an international standard player; my point was simply meant to be that he was scoring hundreds every game, and then did strikingly less well in the Ashes after his call-up.

From Wiki: ""Wenger conceded afterwards his team were paying for their participation in the UEFA Cup, as “…the recovery time is too short. We only had two and a half days, which is not enough, especially when you are travelling""""

However, from then on, our league form after UEFA Cup games remained good, and the only other result that was affected was the Newcastle game on the season's final day, when we rested players to keep them fresh for the final. Also worth noting we went from 5th in March to 2nd in May despite the UEFA Cup.

WHEN Jos Buttler replaced Matt Prior as England keeper last summer it marked a significant generational shift in the team. But in one respect the story was one of continuity. Like Prior seven years earlier, Buttler had been picked to score runs, even though he was not the best wicketkeeper in the country.

Buttler, who did not even have a full season of keeping in first-class cricket before playing Test cricket for England, is part of a trend. Counties and national sides increasingly prefer to pick wicketkeepers who can bat in the top seven, and often the top six, rather than more skilled practitioners behind the stumps. The need for batting prowess has been made more urgent by the decline of the great allrounder: nobody of note has emerged since the retirements of Andrew Flintoff, Shaun Pollock and Jacques Kallis.

Jack Russell, the former England wicketkeeper, believes there has been a “definite shift” in the 16 years since Adam Gilchrist made his Test debut. When Gilchrist started, Les Ames’ eight Test centuries in the 1930s were the record for a keeper. Gilchrist managed 17 hundreds, the volume and speed of his scoring redefining what was considered possible for a keeper.

Russell says more has been demanded of keepers since Alan Knott’s Test debut in 1967. Russell himself was usurped by Alec Stewart, who switched from being an opening batsman to offer England a more reliable source of runs from their keeper.

“Jos has to learn his trade at international level, which is not easy,” Russell says. “He’s going to miss a few. He’s going to make mistakes because he’s still searching for his game.

“If they’re going to take this route they have to understand the standard of keeping is not going to be as high as it perhaps should be for a period of time while the keeper is learning.” Proof came in the third Test in the Caribbean: Buttler missed a stumping chance offered by Jermaine Blackwood, who remained unbeaten as West Indies won the match and levelled the series.

Prior is an example of what can be achieved. “I saw Matt in his early days for Sussex and he struggled, but turned out to be a top-class keeper,” Russell says. He predicts that Buttler will become “a brilliant keeper” on account of his outstanding hand-eye 
co-ordination and work ethic.

In an age in which the keeper-batsman has morphed into the batsman-keeper, young batsmen can be “converted”. Gary Wilson, who kept for Ireland in the World Cup, is a case in point. “I was playing for Ireland U-15s and they asked me to do it one day. It turned out to be a great move for me because when I was trying to get into county cricket, Surrey needed a keeper,” he says. “Keeping’s a lot about just having a good pair of hands and good co-ordination.”

Two batsmen, Marcus Trescothick and Vikram Solanki, kept on occasions for England in ODI or T20 cricket. Rahul Dravid sometimes kept in his youth but had abandoned the gloves by the time he reached international cricket. Although he had never kept in first-class cricket, he was asked to do so as India sought extra batting depth in their ODI side. Dravid ended up doing the job in 73 ODIs, including the 2003 World Cup final.

Improvements in gloves have made it easier to take up keeping at a relatively late age. “Flexible gloves make it easier to catch the ball because it’s more like replicating your hands,” says Stuart Waterton, a brand manager at Kookaburra.

The paucity of mystery spin on the county and international circuit today risks making keeping less of a specialist skill. The fate of two of cricket’s most loved, but endangered, species are inherently intertwined. Mystery spin needs a supreme keeper to be most effective; the most adept glovemen require challenging spin bowling to show off their worth.

“The combination of keeper and spinner is critical — for a legspinner even more so,” Russell says. “If we suddenly unearthed the new Shane Warne life would become more difficult for keepers because you’ve got the ball going three ways.” Adil Rashid’s emergence in ODI cricket will provide a deeper test of Buttler’s skills.

Perhaps paradoxically, the gluttonous totals that characterise ODI cricket today might benefit the most dexterous keepers. While the currency of runs has been devalued, wickets are worth more than ever, the logic underpinning New Zealand’s aggressive bowling tactics in the World Cup. It could lead to a subtle re-evaluation of the wicketkeeper’s role. Especially in the shorter formats, a superior gloveman might become preferred to a rival averaging an extra 10 runs per innings.

“The one-day keeper is probably more important than ever,” Russell says. “If you miss a chance off McCullum or Gayle they could kill you.” The same is true of T20. “You can play your best keeper because often not everyone needs to bat. The winning margins in T20 are so fine that you could be talking one stumping and the game can be won and lost.”

BJ Watling, New Zealand’s regular Test gloveman, has only been a regular keeper since the age of 25, when he was told it represented his best chance of international selection. When Quinton de Kock was selected for South Africa two years ago, he was not even first-choice keeper for his domestic team. He is now South Africa’s number one in all three formats.
