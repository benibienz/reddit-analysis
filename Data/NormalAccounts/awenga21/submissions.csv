Was just wondering out of genuine interest how you all feel about these new signings. I've been a supporter since 2006, so I've been through a fair few bad times as well as the good years at the start, but I personally am in two minds. 

Firstly, I think it's awesome that we're no longer playing in that horrible ground in High Wycombe which was impossible to get to, it's great to watch attacking rugby and to see us compete at a really high level, and I can't wait to see Beale, Eastmond, Le Roux et al. playing for us next season because I'm sure we'll do well.

On the other hand, it feels a bit odd. I'm afraid that moving to Coventry has alienated quite a lot of the old fanbase, I feel as though we're buying our way to success somewhat and I'm uncomfortable with that, and a lot of our players are overseas-born. I'm not saying that as a complaint necessarily, because obviously it's great to have a multinational team with lots of talent, but having myself thought ""Saffacens"" were losing their identity because of their multitude of overseas players and lack of academy talent, I'm now feeling that to an extent, we're going down a similar route.

The North Group is all finished after today and **Northants, Warwickshire, Yorkshire** and **Worcestershire** are through to the quarter-finals, which are on the 17th and 18th August.

The South Group finishes tomorrow. **Somerset** have already qualified, and are guaranteed a home quarter-final. If **Essex** beat Gloucestershire tomorrow then they are definitely through to a home quarter-final as well. Then, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex and Surrey can all still qualify depending on results tomorrow. Two of those teams will go through and two will go out.

So the QFs will be:

Somerset vs Worcestershire/Yorkshire

1st/2nd in South Group vs Worcestershire/Yorkshire

Warwickshire vs 3rd in South Group

Northants vs 4th in South Group.

Hope this helps!
