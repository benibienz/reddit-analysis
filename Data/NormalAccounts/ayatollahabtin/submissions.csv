Now i first wanted to buy a laptop but everyones telling me that it would be a waste of money so im contemplating on either buying a ready made pc or building one but none of these facilities are available here in Heidelberg since its a small city so i'd have to order it all online. I would prefer something small easy to carry around in case i need to move and cheap but beast enough to run csgo all of its maps and only csgo because i dont play other games. I saw on mantrousse's new video an alienware X51R3 and it looked exactly like what i need anyone have any opinions on it? i think micro-atx's would be best for me and if i was to build one is there a website that you can like pick all the parts you want and stuff and they assemble it for you and deliver it ready made cause i dont know how to build a pc as i said barely know anything about pcs.
