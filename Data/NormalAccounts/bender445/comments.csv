4,"PSA: you don't need to wash your hair every time you shower. Once a week to once a month is enough depending on your hair. 

edit: for those asking, I'm no expert but [this article](http://stylecaster.com/beauty/how-often-should-i-wash-my-hair/) seems to sum it up ""The answer is pretty simple: Washing hair every day removes our natural oils and proteins, causing our hair to dry out quicker. Shampoo strips the oils from the hair, and we need those oils to help our scalp and hair to be healthy""

I personally have thicker, wavy hair and so I can get away with hardly washing but I understand those with thinner hair may need to do it a little more frequently. ",2016-11-16 23:46:19+00:00,da3hdu7,1.0,t3_5dae1y,23297.0,SkincareAddiction
