As I've seen the traffic in this sub increase over the last month I've been seeing more and more talk about punt categories draft strategies than I have in years past (especially the fabulous guides posted by /u/EliteFantasyBBall). 

I won't claim to be an expert and every type of research you can do is helpful, but I think there is an argument to be made for taking the best available for the first few rounds and then filling in needs in the later rounds (obviously with some per-determined targets).

The main reason for my argument is injuries. It's a long season and most of our lineups will look nothing like it does on draft night by the end. It's important to remain flexible, if your best 3 point shooter gets injured but there is a super hot blocks specialist on the waiver wire, you should have a team that is able to *pivot.*

**edit: my initial query was answered quite nicely by u/featurecreature, but this thread is open for any general discussion about this album.**

Since I first read the wikipedia article for this album a couple years ago, I have been listening to it thinking of it as a "" concept album, the album features a story about a ruined relationship.""  wiki cites this dead link as its reference for that assertion: http://boards.atlanticrecords.com/artists/deathcabforcutie/forums/a/tpc/f/993102669/m/1601042208


Having listened to it through this lense, I can definitely see a pattern of songs about relationships that have gone south. From ""I rushed this, we moved too fast,"" to the seeming climax of the album in Company Calls/Epilogue ""you were the one, but I can't spit it out now.""

Frequent references to a female/male relationship (""I can taste your lipstick on the filter"" ""figures on the wedding cake,"" ""I hope that he keeps you up for weeks, like you did to me,"") and the sort of new-critical approach of knowing the singer is a man who is romantically attracted to women in real life, lead me to listen to the record as a series of songs from the man who is heartbroken over the woman who has moved along and is getting ready to marry some one else.

So, the part where I always get stuck is the song ""No Joy in Mudville."" In this song he is addressing a male, ""you were the king of uprooted destruction."" Why, on the second to last track, does he seem to start addressing a different person? The track after what I am calling the climax of the story. The tone of the track seems to match.

I suppose some one could make the case that I am making too much of the genders, or that the assertion that this is a concept album isn't true or doesn't mean exactly that this is one fluid story. I just thought it might be an interesting discussion point for this reddit about one of my favorite albums of all time.
