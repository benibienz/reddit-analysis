It's a good way for Microsoft to diversify their company, increase growth, and do it all in a very cheap way. (Cheap being relative)


Just to clarify on the cheap comment. Linkedin made $750 million last year, Microsoft is going to take in $26 billion in debt which will probably carry an interest rate of... 5% (in reality the real rate will probably be close to 2 or 3%). So 2% of that annualized is about $520 million, which given tax breaks on interest payments and debt loads, well linkedin pays for itself immediately.

Stellaris will most likely be similar in the sense that it's not really a mindless ""conquer"" kind of game.

Go to war with your ally, use your ally as a meat shield while using your fleets to skirt around your enemy's main fleets and strike at their capital planet. 

Then as you use this large space empire as your personal mercenary army/fleet you grow and expand to a point where you rival them. Then you form alliances with their enemies, and declare war on your once staunch ally.

Considering in that time I've purchased two consoles, 4 controllers, a headset, and paid $60 for every new game I wanted because old games generally age very poorly on consoles. 

Then I figure I've spent about $750 on consoles alone. $200 on controllers. $50 on headset. Then at least $600 on games in the last 6 years. THEN add on Xbox Live member ship for 6 years probably $240ish (always bought at discount there). I've spent a minimum of $1840. 

So over 6 years on Steam I've spent a whopping total of $375ish. Probably around $100 on other games outside of steam. And that my two most played games I picked up for FREE &amp; $40 with 3 expansions. Then add in a new mouse and computer headset (black friday online) $100. I've spent $1775 over 6 years on my PC gaming.

as a former Kanter fan (I bought jersey got signature etc) he is a great scorer, and rebounder! But defense is one thing he is very bad at. That is not in question.

Ultimately the question is - if he's that good, why doesn't Donovan trust him to close out games?

And why is he playing less minutes this year (20 mpg avg) than his last two years?

Whereas the US stock market is probably 10-15% speculative, in other words in the US most investors are investing for long term, they will do company research, check out their revenue, their earnings and then invest because they believe the company is a sound investment and had growth potential or will maintain their market position.

Still - The fear of market contagion or ELI5 terms the danger of their collapsing stocks causing other markets to collapse are small because while China's stock market is growing it pales in comparison to other major stock markets. What we are seeing world wide is a combination of factors.

A. Oil price drops - it's odd to think that something that is tied to spending power could drop the economy, but it's a fairly large market, so that spread some panic into it's investors.

B. The Fed is talking about raising rates next month which has been making European investors and countries very worried. They have to keep their rates low because many EU economies are not recovered or are recovering very slowly so they fear a US rate hike will suck money from Europe into America further destabalizing Europe. So Europe has been selling off, which is a bigger market that has a lot of American companies and investors.

C. The US stock market is overvalued, we've been on a growth pattern that is steeper and longer than some of the biggest stock surges in modern history.

497,"No I don't believe it is. Re the Halo Wiki:

As the Forerunner-Precursor war drew to a close, the few remaining Precursors that were pushed out beyond the edges of the galaxy to Path Kethona sought vengeance against the Forerunners. A few Precursors were spared by the Forerunners, while others became a dust which could regenerate into their past forms. Over time this dust became so corrupted that it could only cause horrific disease and mutation. The Precursors, driven insane by the rebellion of their creations, embraced this corruption and became part of it, becoming the Flood to destroy the Forerunners as a final act of vengeance against them.[5] They sent several ships containing this powder to Forerunner controlled planets.

http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Flood

What's more interesting is that Ancient Humans were the most effective in combating the Flood. In Fact, as Humanity essentially went on a ""scorched Earth"" policy to contain the flood, That is conquering new planets and laying waste to planets on the front of the war with the Flood, Is what led them to their war with the Forerunners.

Also as humanity slugged it out with the forerunners, causing the forerunners to deploy their best weapons and tactics to combat the ever adaptive and extremely efficient warlike humans, humanity was also holding of the flood on another front.

Would suck to be in that situation.

EDIT: Technically they are extra galactic since the forerunners essentially exiled all surviving precursors to a small galaxy on the end of the Milky Way, and there the Precursors went mad and created the Flood... from themselves. But, the precursors come from the Milky Way originally so... I guess it's true both ways, but they cannot come back from that location since when the Omega Halo Fired it destroyed all life in that galaxy as well.",2015-08-07 20:16:35+00:00,ctv6x26,7.0,t1_ctv4x3t,3016,xboxone
