My boss is quitting right as we go into our busiest months of the year in my finance job. We are a large company 1,000+ employees, but the finance department is very new. In fact it was me (sr. Analyst) and my boss (managing director).

So now as we move into our busiest time of the year, that was going to be 60 hour weeks with both of us, now just leaves me. There are discussions that I'll be promoted at the end of the busy months because around that time I'll finish my MBA.

However I'm taking on a lot more responsibility now. I want to ask for a smallish raise now, and then, after our busy season, I want to negotiate a larger raise based on my MBA and potential promotion.

But I need advice, is that a good idea? If so, how do I go about it?

FYI, I'm 27 going on 28. Finish MBA in July, and I have 4.5 years experience in finance, and I've been with the company a year.

Majority of up time will be for gaming or recording/film editing. I do some small youtube stuff and my wife also does personal fitness youtube videos. Looking for something that can crush gaming and editing.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

Somewhere in the $1,000 range give or take a hundred

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Within 4 to 6 months. Ideally I'm going to piece it together over that time if possible.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Tower, Keyboard.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* USA, Utah. Closest MicroCenter is in Denver so not an option.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* I've got an off brand gaming mouse currently, and monitor will be my 2nd TV for the time being. a Samsung 1080p 42""

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Possibly, no interest at start, but possibly down the line. I'm unfamiliar with overclocking though.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* If budget permits an SSD would be awesome, but currently on my gaming laptop I have about 300gb of games so I'd be looking for something along the lines of 1TB

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* Don't really care. If it looks cool - awesome, if not it doesn't matter since it will be tucked into the desk. 

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

Yes - the least buggy one... I've got complaints with Windows 10 now, but maybe on a newer machine it might run smoother.

Sunday I found myself wanting to play it again... I held off.

For home business it would only include multiple spreadsheets and software like quickbooks running simultaniously.

For gaming I'm mostly interested in overall performance of games themselves. Not so concered with frame rate, but the higher the better. (Honestly I want this thing to be able to run the next StarCraft at ultra, but that's not a deal breaker.)

Here is the build I picked... but it's a little over priced for my budget. Any advice on how I could get this to the 900-1000 range (or under?)
