3) after 24 hours, melt the dragonflies and buy another 2, repeat every day until end of sale, keep the final 2 dragonflies (you can skip this step if you think this is criminal)  
4) melt 1 dragonfly and use the credits and upgrade the last dragonfly to 315p  
5) use your free upgrade and upgrade the 315p to reliant kore  
6) if you play the alpha, at least you can enjoy the kore in your hangar, meanwhile you can look for a '325a- sen upgrade' from the grey market

lets say 58eur includes VAT 20%, you are left with 48 eur (buys $60 worth of stuff from the store)

The mustang alpha can be 'upgraded' to the P-52 merlin back and forth, so you can already try 2 ships in one package, albeit one at a time  

with the remaining $15, theres not much interesting ships to upgrade to (within $30+$15) [ship values](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7925181/sc/store%20ships%2020121226%20limited%20marked.jpg)

his store also sold physical items (after cig stopped selling) with reasonable price, not many other people sell

the 'early bird amber patron '$215  
and the normal 'amber patron' $250  

then post-kickstarter they offered the KS packages again (for a limited period) but added $25 to amber and higher packages to cover the shipping costs of the collectors edition.  

So mine cost $275 each. You can find more info about the package [here](http://www.thedregs.net/topic/60-wts-kickstarter-amber-pledge/)
