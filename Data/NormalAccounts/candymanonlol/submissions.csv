My brother was on a break from university so he decided to make an account. He got the account to roughly 40 in most F2P stats , that took him about a month-ish. Time came around and my brother had to go back to university but this time he was studying abroad , he forgot about RuneScape and hadnt played it until he got back home which was about 2 weeks ago.(He was gone for about a year)
 -
I found out yesterday that my brothers account was banned for macroing in July (He was overseas in a different country) and my brother left the country in March which is a 4 months difference.

tl;dr

My brother got banned for macroing when he hadnt logged on the account in a 4 months
(he left the country &amp; account in March , it got banned in July and then he tried to log on this year for the first time in a year)

Please help , he just wants to play f2p runescape , thats it. :(",2007scape,My brother got banned for macroing even though he hadn't logged on the account in 4 months.,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/46cimw/my_brother_got_banned_for_macroing_even_though_he/
