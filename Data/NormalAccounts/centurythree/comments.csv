0,"I'd also suggest not park hopping. With an infant, it's really too much to do multiple parks. Getting all the way to Be Our Guest won't be that relaxing either. I do really like the World Showcase idea. There are plenty of great places to eat there, or you just stroll around and snack. 

In terms of restaurants and infants, I think you're okay since Disney is kid-friendly. T-Rex will be very hectic and loud (maybe too much for an infant), but the choices look good. I think the move for lunch vs. dinner is a good one, especially given the heat. That will slow you down, and I suspect you'll end up resting a lot more than you expect.

9,"It wouldn't shock me to see the Great Movie Ride replaced, but I doubt it would happen before Toy Story Land at least. To swap it out for a Mickey-themed ride, it would probably take a few years given Disney's usual timeline. The Great Movie Ride needs some type of upgrade, but it still takes in a lot of crowds. So it's needed for capacity at least in the next 2-3 years. 

In terms of the ride, I have mixed feelings. I love classic films and TCM, so it doesn't bother me to see older movies. On the other hand, there are spots that could be changed without losing that feel. Footlight Parade would be fine to update; Tarzan is another one. I also would like to see animatronic upgrades like they did with the 2008 Spaceship Earth update. That would also help to improve the ride without massive set changes.

Book some of the less-popular restaurants (Morocco, Hacienda in Mexico, even Rose and Crown if possible) and enjoy it. Since there are fewer attractions to rush to, you'll have a lot of time there.

In a way, WDW is a victim of its own success. It draws such large crowds that Disney doesn't feel like it needs to make as many updates to it.

1. Replace Footlight Parade. Representing musicals is great, but the effects don't really work.

2. I agree that Tarzan could use a replacement. I'm not a big fan of bringing in tons of Disney properties, but this might be a good spot to add Pirates of the Caribbean. 

3. While I like the Sorcerer's Apprentice, I do feel like it doesn't fit with the transitions between scenes. It seems like a filler, which is true since they originally planned to put the Cyclone here.

In a more general sense, I'd like to see more upgrades to effects and animatronics. The Witch looks great, but a lot of the others aren't on the same scale.

244,"The biggest difference between the two resorts is the size of each one. Disneyland is easy to access with two parks directly next to each other and hotels close by. The Disneyland Park is also a lot smaller, so it's really easy to navigate. On the downside, it can get pretty packed in there since the paths aren't as wide. I think it's a minor issue, though.

I could totally write an essay on all the differences and what to do, but I'll stick to the attractions not to miss. You definitely need to check out Pirates, which is longer and very different. There also are quite a few changes with Space Mountain and the Haunted Mansion. It's a Small World also is worth doing for the different scale and outdoor entry.  The Tiki Room is the original version and you can even eat a Dole Whip inside.

In terms of rides that aren't in Florida, Indiana Jones should be a top priority. It uses Dinosaur's ride system but has much better sets and doesn't feel as jerky. The Matterhorn is a must do, even if it is a bit rough. Fantasyland dark rides like Mr. Toad, Pinnochio, and Snow White are really cool to do, plus the Alice in Wonderland dark ride. Disneyland is far superior to Disney World in its multitude of dark rides.

At DCA, the obvious one to target is Radiator Springs Racers and Cars Land. If you're into coasters, California Screamin' is also very solid. And I'd make sure to see World of Color even in its newer version.",2016-02-11 15:44:48+00:00,czw363a,1.0,t3_458qyr,8173.0,WaltDisneyWorld

September and October were a lot busier this past fall than usual, and there's no total offseason anymore. That said, I think you'll be good if you get to the parks early and use FP+ effectively.

If you're just going to sleep and want to do Value, I'd recommend Pop Century.

It didn't always work but was interesting and really took off as it went along (like you say).

I think it really hurt the show to have so much backlash from fans of SGA. Many fans were so upset that they hoped SGU would fail. That said, I do think that the show's creators didn't handle the cancellation of SGA and announcement of SGU well. A little break between the shows might have been a good thing.
