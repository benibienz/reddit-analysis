3,"&gt; I guess I am just going to have to read up more about it. But so far I don't see any reason not to do it.

There're still a number of things on TumbleBit I'm not entirely clear on. For instance, once you complete a TumbleBit receive, are you then required to settle back to the Bitcoin block chain, or can ""roll over"" into another TumbleBit transaction without incurring another Bitcoin transaction fee? I also have not gone through the nitty gritty of RSA cryptography yet. But most everyone seems to view it as very promising.

9,"&gt; Okay, I'll bite. How does TumbleBit reduce on-chain transaction traffic? Which LN is expected to to, with the added bonus that it provides a measure of anonymity to blockchain-searchable transactions by bundling them together.   

Same way LN is expected to is my understanding. In fact, if you use the tumbler capability in TumbleBit, I believe it enhances anonymity far more than just passing coins through LN. The difference is a malleability fix is needed for LN, so TumbleBit can be used *right now*. In fact, there's a proof of concept implementation on Github.  

&gt; To be clear though, I think it's great. Let's do both. That would be the ultimate free-market solution, would it not?  

I fully agree, but LN will need to wait until malleability is fixed. If TumbleBit works and reduces on-chain transaction load easing scaling concerns, the priority to implement SegWit (or a superior alternative) just continues to drop.  

&gt; I am not opposed to it for certain cases. If it encourages more people to operate full verifying nodes all the better.  

Glad to hear you say that.  

&gt; We do not really differ in that regard. I just don't place quite the importance on what happens in some little corner of the ocean that is the Internet. I just happen to prefer smaller subs, even if I am in the minority of opinion.  

I'd like for it to happen on /r/Bitcoin, which is still the better and more established Bitcoin property on Reddit. I'd also prefer to do it on BitcoinTalk, but that's another censored and controlled forum, though the forums on bitcoin.com, bitco.in, and others seem to be making decent in-roads. Continuing censorship just does not permit it in these web spaces.

11,"Yes, in that sense TumbleBit is a layer 2 competitor to LN (though it has other capability like anonymizing). I have hopes for all possibly scaling innovation, but LN needs a malleability fix, which placed pressure to adopt SegWit especially with Blockstream/Core continuing to hold regular on-chain scaling hostage. Now there is TumbleBit, a layer 2 payment channel system *that does not need a malleability fix*. Thus SegWit is now less critical *even if the block size limit does not get raised*.  

We should use a node referendum solution when it's simpler, can be immediately trusted, when it does not require ecosystem-wide coding changes, and when it offers compete choice to all community participants. Node referendums just work, as is continually demonstrated elsewhere in the crypto-currency community, in spite of small blocker FUD against it. In fact, Ethereum's third node referendum will be tomorrow. We should particularly use a node referendum instead of an abused ""soft"" fork when the purported backwards compatibility of the ""soft"" fork is essentially a lie that instead removes the fully validating capability of nodes that opt out against there will our without their knowledge.

I did nothing of the sort, I didn't even know it existed and still don't understand what advantage it gives. Do you?  

&gt; You don't use infinite lock times to keep a channel open indefinitely. It is actually relative lock times (CSV) that make this trick possible. But users don't interact with LN in that way, all of this occurs transparent to the user who doesn't even have to know how those opcodes work.  

You need to renew. Even relative lock times (CSV) always expire because they must contain a finite value. The difference is the auto-renewal feature, which as stated in the wiki you quoted, only works when both parties continue to be in avowed agreement. In a breach situation when one side must close a channel unilaterally, their bitcoin is tied up until the CSV expires.

If the block size limit is increased, and TumbleBit lives up to its promise *there is no urgent need to fix transaction malleability, the primary purpose of SegWit*. If after due consideration, SegWit is determined to be the best solution available, let's extremely carefully evaluate the code to implement it, possibly deploy it on a smaller market cap altcoin first, then finally roll it out when we're all completely confident. (Even if the malleability fix ends up *not* being SegWit, I think the same approach would be sensible for any alternative that *is* implemented.)

&gt; ... Lightning channels don't have a hard deadline for when they need to close and so can stay open indefinitely **as long as the participants continue to cooperate.**

18,"&gt; So, here again, you are determining the placement of a brand by a majority instead of calling what is already Bitcoin as such because it complies with protocols which were already called Bitcoin.

Calling anything ""Bitcoin"" based on protocols from any point of time would imply that the entity is static forever. If that is your intent, I'd say the fact that Bitcoin was always intended to be ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" trumps all. If not, I stand behind what I've previously stated.  

&gt; That is an optional special state called a limbo channel. It is mainly for probabilistic payments used for sub-Satoshi transactions.  

Bullshit, read LN again.  

&gt; Yes, an LN channel can be left open indefinitely as long a both parties want to keep it open. This is what the CSV opcode made possible. Done deal.  

You can never leave a channel open in LN indefinitely, or when you unilaterally try to close the channel you'd be waiting forever to spend your funds. If both parties are agreeing, all you get is continual auto-renewal.

21,"&gt; So Bitcoin's restriction on supply applies within Bitcoin's validity rules. If it is outside those rules then it is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin's protocols restrict coin creation to programmatic inflation. Only so many coins can be created per block. And only so many coins can be created, ever. If these restrictions are violated then the agent violating those restrictions is not Bitcoin.  

Nope: any *crypto-currency's* restriction on supply applies within its own validity rules. Whether the cryptocurrency in question is ""Bitcoin"" in name is determined by economic majority.  

&gt; You pretty much just reiterated my characterization of your view.  

Strange you can recognize this, yet misinterpret its inherent meaning so badly.  

&gt; Tumbling actually occurs off-chain, where transactions from several parties are consolidated and redistributed...  

Depending on how tumbling is achieved it can be either on or off chain, but notice I said ""tumbled"", past tense.  

&gt; That's some magic trick... POOF it's not Bitcoin... ZAP it's Bitcoin again!  

Granted, perhaps I've used some imprecision. Maybe it's better to say unencumbered Bitcoin versus encumbered Bitcoin if you prefer.  Given the choice of the two, I'll always take unencumbered Bitcoin, which makes the two types non-interchangeable and differing in value. I choose to think of the one with comparatively less utility as not really Bitcoin, but that's really inaccurate.  

&gt; I don't think you understand how LN works, the contracts do use the CLTV and CSV opcodes but users do not interact with the opcodes at that level. You can open or close a channel whenever you want, all that functionality is transparent to the user. Granted, you will probably not want to open or close a channel any more than necessary due to the fees involved, but you can do this any time you want to. In practice many channels will likely remain open indefinitely.  

I've studied LN closely twice now and I believe I've got a good handle. You cannot close a channel *and immediately have unencumbered Bitcoin* unless you have the cooperation of the other party in your channel. If you do so without the other party's cooperation, you'll need to wait for the time lock to expire before the funds are spendable. This is where LN is not completely trustless, but only approximates true trustlessness. No LN channels can ever be open indefinitely, but they are working on making channel auto-renewal being transparent to the end-user. Having an infinite time lock is not possible in Bitcoin and would break LN. Also, for the reason I mentioned earlier, it always behooves the user to use a shorter channel time lock if possible to enhance the near-trustlessness, but this also would require more Bitcoin transactions over a fixed span of time, and on a block size limited Bitcoin, more incidents of artificially supply-limited high transaction fees (this is also why artificially small block size limit erodes LN's trustlessness). Further, the fact that LN channels can have varying balances, varying ratio of those balances in either channel direction, and varying time lock lengths and varying remaining time lock until channel expiration is among the reasons that truly decentralzed LN routing is not really practical at this point in time.",2016-11-22 02:47:02+00:00,daagjoa,97.0,t1_daafdl8,1594.0,btc

28,"&gt; Not so. If a fork creates new coins it does not satisfy the restriction that Bitcoin places on coin creation. It cannot be Bitcoin.

Nonsense, any crypto-currency's restriction on supply only applies within its own validity rules. Otherwise, you'd need to factor consideration not only for all possible altcoins, but also any possible value characterizing token in the universe.  

&gt; You seem to think that ""Bitcoin"" is simply a brand which can be adopted by any random majority. To me Bitcoin is a set of protocols.  

You are progressively mischaracterizing my position. I've never said Bitcoin was a brand or even implied anything of the sort. I said that the underlying function of Bitcoin (and any Bitcoin-based cryptocrrency) is what enables markets to decide which will be the most dominant version. That dominance will automatically give that version the right to call itself ""Bitcoin"". Not what you, I, or any other individual or economic minority subset thinks should be ""Bitcoin"" by protocol.  

&gt; By the same standard then I guess you would have to say that Bitcoin sent to sombody else's wallet is not Bitcoin, because it no longer has the same fungibility because it is not fungible for you. Sorry but this argument does not make any sense to me. Because all you are doing is agreeing to place some bitcoin under the control of a smart contract... It is just a smart contract that uses more opcodes than a simple transaction does. All Bitcoin transactions are smart contracts.  

Now you're just trying to twist my statements in ridiculous fashion. For the record, on-chain bitcoin is bitcoin. So sent, received, tumbled, fricasseed -- if it's on-chain, it's bitcoin. Any bitcoin locked so that it can't be freely used on-chain is not equivalent. Specifically, with LN, funds in channels are not bitcoin until you close the channels and the channel-closing transactions get confirmed on-chain.

41,"&gt; What you seem to be saying is that forks create altcoins.  

That is definitely **not** what I'm saying, since many in the Bitcoin community have given the word ""altcoin"" a negative connotation and use the term derisively. It is what it is, a fork of Bitcoin, issuing from the same original genesis block. You are the one that compared using it to getting forced into an altcoin. Only in that sense is it *similar*.  

&gt; Bitcoin with a soft-forked Segwit is still Bitcoin because it just represents definition of additional restrictions as a subset of the protocols.  

You might be right, but we'll only know in retrospect. I believe the market will determine what ""Bitcoin"" is at any point in time. If the SHA256 has function remains the same, I believe Bitcoin will always be defined by the block chain emanating from the Bitcoin genesis block that has the most work. If the work function gets changed, Bitcoin will be the most successful fork, likely made clear by market cap.  

&gt; LN and related smart contract networks are still Bitcoin, because the opcodes which make them work are defined restrictions of the protocols.  

I can't comment about the specifics of unspecified smart contract networks, but I don't agree that bitcoin locked in LN payment channels is ""bitcoin"" in the normal on-chain sense. It is clearly not equivalently fungible. Which is not to say I don't think layer 2 solutions will be useful, just that tokens in layer 2 channels that don't have identical (or superior) characteristics to on-chain bitcoin can never be considered fully equivalent.  

&gt; A fork that creates new coins is not Bitcoin because it violates Bitcoin's economic assumptions. In this way an altcoin is not Bitcoin. The way forward for those who wish to transact on a blockchain with bigger blocks is to develop a Bitcoin compatible sidechain.  

This is nonsense, since if it was true at all, the operations which allow it would not be possible in Bitcoin. What you or I *think* defines Bitcoin does not really matter.

53,"&gt; They have that choice with an altcoin.  

Forcing someone to altcoin from Bitcoin is not choice. Bitcoin was established as ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" from day one. Anyone wishing to change it to a ""settlement network"" should be forced to an altcoin (or just make their own) unless there is universal consensus within Bitcoin for the change. Further, those that would tacitly condone (or even deploy) unethical behavior such as censorship, unwarranted user banning, DDoS attacks, Sybil voting sabotage, closed-door miner negotiating, etc., should be disqualified from having their opinions considered.  

&gt; This is also something we already have with altcoins.  

Exactly why hard forks are not a problem whatsoever. Moreover, *hard forks are unpreventable*. Since this is the case, the only way for Bitcoin to further develop its anti-fragility (and to allow complete innovation to bloom) is to allow this avenue free expression, not suffer political suppression.  

&gt; However, with sidechains developers have an opportunity to take advantage of the market dominance of Bitcoin by making Bitcoin-compatible sidechains while otherwise pursuing their own feature set.  

That's all fine, if a *trustless* sidechain solution existed. It does not -- all existing two-peg sidechains must be *federated*.

54,"&gt; Is not likely to be very appetizing to miners. Despite the prospect of a patch to hurry things along.  

Miners would be signaling the majority, otherwise the fork would not happen, so difficulty would not be a concern for them. It's only a factor on the minority chain, should it persist after the fork.  

&gt; This is not actually something we have to speculate too much about. We will know, at least from nodes which accept incoming connections, what percentage of the community agrees when the miners activate it. And a certain percentage of those remaining will also just be nodes which didn't upgrade from sheer negligence.  

My point is you can take the ""soft"" fork route, and unethically subvert the former fully validating capability of those that opt out (such behavior is very much in keeping with the Core/Blockstream playbook and history), or you can present a hard fork which gives everyone in the ecosystem full, free choice. To me, it's a very clear, ethically guided decision.  

And the most suspicious thing: if *any* hard fork occurs in Bitcoin, it dramatically increases the chances that true Bitcoin developer decentralization will start to develop, finally decentralizing what is currently *the most centralized part of Bitcoin*. And this is why I believe Core/Blockstream fight, FUD, and propagandize so hard against hard forks, because it risks their current captured monopoly over the Bitcoin community.",2016-11-21 07:49:45+00:00,da9a9h8,87.0,t1_da915fh,17062.0,btc

56,"&gt; Straight on-chain scaling requires a hard fork... How ""hard"" would that be on legacy nodes?

Actually, the point is the in the worst case, a hard fork offers complete choice. Those on the forked chain, presumably the majority continue on their way. Those that choose not to participate simply remain on the original chain. Of course it could  take forever for difficulty to adjust properly, but anyone in that faction could code a simple difficulty reset if they're not willing to simply wait. Then participants on both chains *remain fully validating* and no one has this capability forcibly removed from them.  

Miners understand that a fork will be required at some point, and that it's been done in various crypto-currencies with nearly no issues, perhaps most prominently in the Ethereum case.  

&gt; It does this as a soft fork which is a lot ""easier"" on legacy nodes than a hard fork, if that is your concern. And it provides a more reliable upgrade path for the network than may be expected of a hard fork at this stage of development.  

This is exactly backwards from my point of view. The ""soft"" fork approach lords it over whatever subset of the community chooses to opt out. Even if 95% percent of miners' hash rate activates ""soft"" fork SegWit, it's very likely a much larger proportion of the Bitcoin community would forcibly and progressively lose their fully validating capability. This is so onerous, that I wouldn't be surprised if this minority faction would quickly organize a hard fork at that point (should it ever come to this, more likely the hard fork will occur *before* SegWit activation if it looks like it will occur).",2016-11-21 02:25:04+00:00,da8zedi,85.0,t1_da8wzpe,3496.0,btc

59,"&gt; Gustavo Díaz also runs a website that tracks the black-market exchange of the bolivar, swaying the price of everything from rice to cars  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; By ANATOLY KURMANAEV  
&gt; Nov. 20, 2016 3:15 p.m. ET  
&gt; 
&gt; HOOVER, Ala.—Public Enemy No. 1 of Venezuela’s revolutionary government is Gustavo Díaz, a Home Depot Inc. employee in central Alabama.  
&gt; 
&gt; On his lunch breaks from the hardware section, Mr. Díaz, 60 years old, does more than anyone else to set the price of everything from rice to aspirin to cars in his native Venezuela, influencing the inflation rate and swaying millions of dollars of daily currency transactions.  
&gt; 
&gt; How? He is president of one of Venezuela’s most popular and insurgent websites, DolarToday.com, which provides a benchmark exchange rate used by his compatriots to buy and sell black-market dollars. That allows them to bypass some of the world’s most rigid currency controls.  
&gt; 
&gt; Socialist President Nicolás Maduro has accused DolarToday of leading an “economic war” against his embattled government and vowed to jail Mr. Díaz and his two partners, also Venezuelan expatriates in the U.S. The Venezuelan central bank unsuccessfully filed suit against the website twice in U.S. courts. The government has also turned to hackers to launch constant attacks, Mr. Díaz said, forcing the site to use sophisticated defenses.  
&gt; 
&gt; “DolarToday is the Empire’s strategy to push down the currency and overthrow Maduro,” Vice President Aristóbulo Istúriz said earlier this year, asserting that the U.S.—“The Empire” to the Venezuelan government—was orchestrating the site’s work. “DolarToday is the enemy of the people.”  
&gt; 
&gt; The U.S. State Department declined to comment.  
&gt; 
&gt; The alleged mastermind of the plot likes to sport a red University of Alabama baseball cap and answers questions at his day job from do-it-yourselfers on what kinds of screws they should use to hang shelves.  
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Díaz is a U.S.-trained retired colonel, and he indeed tried to overthrow Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, by participating in a short-lived coup in 2002. Mr. Díaz, who had been deputy security chief to the businessman who briefly took power in the ill-fated overthrow, said his conspiring days are over.  
&gt; 
&gt; Now, he said, he is fighting for economic freedom and for Venezuelans’ access to information in a country that makes financial and other data secret. Venezuela is undergoing a brutal recession that has made it hard for most of the country’s 30 million people to find enough food and medicine.  
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s ironic that with DolarToday in Alabama, I do more damage to the government than I did as a military man in Venezuela,” said Mr. Díaz, a short, soft-spoken man with a gray mane.  
&gt; 
&gt; He moved in 2005 to Alabama, where a brother and sister were already living, and after being granted political asylum became a citizen.  
&gt; 
&gt; In Hoover, a suburb of Birmingham, he lives with his wife in a two-bedroom townhouse in a maple-leaf-strewn neighborhood and drives a beat-up 2010 Toyota Corolla with his Home Depot schedule attached to the sun visor. He translates part-time in a city court to make ends meet. Mr. Díaz’s 23-year-old son shares a house with friends nearby.  
&gt; 
&gt; On his rare days off, he sticks to his home nation’s favorite pastimes: family and baseball. He hasn’t caught Crimson Tide football fever and instead prefers to watch the minor-league Birmingham Barons baseball team. “It’s the best you can get in Alabama,” he said.  
&gt; 
&gt; Every day, his wife continues to make him arepas, Venezuela’s traditional breakfast of corn flour turnovers stuffed with shredded meat and cheese.  
&gt; 
&gt; Although about $15 million change hands daily on the Venezuelan black market, Mr. Díaz said he makes little from the Delaware-registered website, which is free to access. The company’s three founding partners—Mr. Díaz, a real-estate agent in Miami and a supermarket technology technician in Seattle—recoup $4,500 a month from selling advertising and the browsing data of about 800,000 unique daily visitors to Google.  
&gt; 
&gt; He sneaks to the bathroom during shifts at Home Depot to check his BlackBerry for gossip about the Venezuelan government sent to him by old friends in the military and the expat media, which always promises an imminent downfall for Mr. Maduro.  
&gt; 
&gt; “To me, it’s still a passionate daily fight against totalitarianism,” said Mr. Díaz.  
&gt; 
&gt; DolarToday began as a Twitter feed that posted the black-market exchange rate for Venezuela’s currency, the bolivar.  
&gt; 
&gt; The partners calculated the rate by polling exchange houses in the border city of Cucuta, Colombia. Colombia is the only country that accepts the nearly worthless bolivar. The government has controlled the bolivar’s official value since 2003 and bars anyone from quoting informal rates.  
&gt; 
&gt; DolarToday’s Twitter page quickly surpassed two million followers, spawning the website, which mixes the daily exchange rate with any news report that makes the government look bad.  
&gt; 
&gt; The site’s numbers show the country’s economic collapse; its rate of about 2,000 bolivars per greenback is a 44% fall since October. Official rates, depending on the type of import, are 10 bolivars per dollar and 660 bolivars per dollar.  
&gt; 
&gt; DolarToday’s rate is used as a reference by a majority of Venezuelan importers that are unable to obtain hard currency through official channels, according to national business groups. In the first half of the year, more than half of Venezuela’s private imports were financed by dollars obtained on the black market, according to Caracas-based consultancy Ecoanalitica.  
&gt; 
&gt; A Caracas dermatologist said she checks the DolarToday rate daily and uses it to buy dollars from patients and acquaintances that she needs to import medicine and new equipment. “It’s a universally accepted price. There’s never any need for haggling,” she said.  
&gt; 
&gt; The Venezuelan government and the central bank didn’t respond to requests for comment.  
&gt; 
&gt; Venezuela closed the border with Colombia in 2015 for a year, stifling trade in dollars and everything else and forcing DolarToday to abandon its old methodology. The website now uses a scanning program to add up dollar buy-and-sell requests posted by Venezuelans on social-media sites. The average rate is then checked against the price offered by big underground exchange houses in Venezuela that serve multinational corporations.  
&gt; 
&gt; Some Venezuelan economists and black-market currency traders say the sample is too small and easy to manipulate. The partners said it is the best they can do in a country that hasn’t released any official economic data for almost two years.  
&gt; 
&gt; Lately, DolarToday has been trying to deflect rumors from Caracas that the site was sold to a pro-government businessman for millions.  
&gt; 
&gt; “If I would have sold,” Mr. Díaz said, “I would be far away in a Maserati, not driving to Home Depot in a Corolla.”

Just when I think you are starting to get it, you talk in circles. You cannot consider what was contained in pre-SegWit blocks equal to what would be contained in post-SegWit blocks, *due to segregated data* that nonetheless must still be transmitted, processed and stored across the Bitcoin network. The total Bitcoin system load of per transaction data is actually on average marginally worse after SegWit than before.

84,"&gt; That it caused a split of the currency and payment network into two, causing Ethereum to lose lots of network effects. No good.  

*Every* one of the hard forks has done this? Oh my, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Monero must be entirely worthless by now.  

Let's look at the most on-point hard fork for your contention: the DAO reimbursement hard fork that spawned Ethereum Classic. [Here's a chart of Ethereum's market cap priced in BTC since then](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). Please point out this dramatic network effect disruption. Which Ethereum important ecosystem participants were lost after the hard fork as part of this dramatic network effect loss? How about you provide just one?  

&gt; By what count? All of them combined (XT, Classic, Unlimited) have around 10% of the network hash rate and around 10% of the network nodes.  

Aside from Unlimited, I was referring to the fact that all XT and Classic clients do not even start the process towards a chain fork until 75% of the last 1,000 blocks would've signaled support. Clearly they were not consensus breaking clients, yet discussion about them remains banned.  

&gt; It was evaluated by the technical community, companies from the industry, and the wider Bitcoin community. You're part of a tiny minority that opposes SegWit for no actual technical merits. Consensus does not mean ""everyone agrees"", it means ""rough widespread consensus"". We definitely have that. As an example, see here and here.  

Without providing a census of those aspects of the community, the rather limited lists you provided are not proof of consensus at all, and even then, they are just subsets of subsets. In fact, you have not even provide a definition of the word ""consensus"" that is being applied.  

There are plenty of lists of those that object to ""soft"" fork SegWit as well. If we add up the two lists and take a percentage, I guarantee you're not getting to Core's 95% consensus standard.",2016-11-20 14:28:45+00:00,da861yi,15.0,t1_da85mm3,1022.0,btc
85,"&gt; The logic is that promoting client software with changes that did not gain consensus in the community could harm the network by splitting the coin in two, as we saw happening with Ethereum.  

What exactly is your concern with the multiple hard forks that have occurred with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic by now? Heck, let's throw in those with Monero for good measure?  

Nonetheless, the alternative clients /r/Bitcoin has banned all already have a 75% provision. By any general conception of ""consensus"", that's plenty strong.  

&gt; The activation threshold only gives miners a say. Even with a 95% activation threshold, the community still has to first build widespread consensus around the protocol change prior to any client software with that change being released to the public. Only then the change should be put up miner signaling, not before,

87,"&gt; segeit tech does not preclude future block size increase.  

Nor does raising or replacing the block size limit with a dynamic limit preclude SegWit, but as I explained, deciding which should be conducted first is simple if you examine priorities, work required, risks involved, time and uncertainties until first increase in transaction capability are realized, etc.  

&gt; only by adopting segwit now we benefit from ALL scaling approaches. If we block segweit now and instead incr. block size whenever wevreach a tx max, we end up scaling only on chain and eliminate other scaling option. this would be irresponsible. the ecosystem must be offered all tools of scalling, not just one.  

Completely untrue. Only by dealing with block size limitations first, do we ensure immediate continued scaling *and* still enjoy emerging scaling solutions that do not depend on malleability fixes such as TumbleBit.  

&gt; I do not concurr with the technical debt hypothesis wrt srgeit any more after learning more on segwit. Just blocking segwit because another alternative solution is perhaps similar is wrong. I disagree that there were no debate and discussion. I am sure there was in quite detail eg on certain mail lists and not always on Reddit, where deep technical discussion would be disturbed by many trolls.

98,"&gt; ... we can only raise the limit as fast as technology allows it to grow if we want to keep decentralization at an acceptable level, but true mainstream adoption may kick-in much too fast. So what do we do then?  

I'm fully open to considerations of growth that potentially could reach put necessary levels of decentralization and censorship-resistance at risk. The problem is Core/Blockstream have shown absolutely no willingness to participate in these discussion. In fact, when some elements of their faction have presented possible solutions in the past, they now completely ignore these facts when they are raised in discussions. To me, it's very important to determine exactly how much technological growth is allowing for the block size limit to be raised right now without decreasing decentralization/censorship-resistance in anyway and to begin discussion from that point. It's publicly clear to all that Core/Blockstream *will not participate in this*.  

&gt; That's where the so-called layer-2 or level-2 solutions like sidechains or payment channels-based technology, incl. lightning network, come into play....  

I too believe layer 2 solutions will be crucial going forward, but I categorically do not believe that Bitcoin in its current infancy must smother itself voluntarily to force itself to rush into what may be half-baked solutions being ramrodded by private corporations and VC interests. Allow all scaling to compete openly, free of centralized manipulation.  

&gt; At the same time, SegWit provides a roughly 70% on-chain up-scaling as a first step - step-wise as wallets implement segwit (and the whole wallet eco-system is heavily working on it as we know when we look around).  

This is only true after activation (*if and when that happens*), after the vast majority of the Bitcoin community codes for, tests and implements SegWit compatible systems (*if and when that happens*), and after a vast majority of the transactions occurring on the Bitcoin network do so using SegWit (*if and when that happens*). Taking all that together, the 70% increase capacity, *if it's ever even reached*, could very likely happen too late, and Bitcoin will have been bouncing off of transaction maximums and driving use-cases away for months or years by that time.  

&gt; So that is what I want: An intelligent evolution of Bitcoin by considering all the outer factual constraints....  

My problem as this: due to the Core/Blockstream factions continuing tacit condoning (or worse) of censorship, unwarranted user banning, and a vast array of other unethical actions, there has never been an open, active, inclusive discussion of ""soft"" fork SegWit's pros and cons, especially relative to alternatives. In fact, there's never even been such discussion comparing ""soft"" fork SegWit to a theoretical hard fork implementation of SegWit. So the central issues are: the self-strangling 1 MB block size limit which is comparatively simple to fix and where the fix would introduce no unnecessary complexity that could bring unforeseen risk, or fixing transaction malleability, which although it would be nice does not stop existing Bitcoin from functioning or the development and implementation of layer 2 solutions such as TumbleBit. Why not solve the issue that can be addressed more easily, and which then reduces stresses and concerns which may force premature adoption of less than optimal or special-interest benefiting ""innovation""?  

&gt; We need such an overall concept. Blocking segwit at this moment is certainly the complete wrong approach.  

I don't agree here. Particularly if we free ourselves from the self-imposed block size limit, perhaps as little as with a dynamic limit that matches existing technological growth, there is absolutely no need to rush into any particular ""concept"".  

In particular, not choosing to support a change is not ""blocking"". Although I personally think both choices were the worst in generations, those who voted for Hillary were not ""blocking"" Trump.  

&gt; ... but this does not mean that segwit is wrong...  

Stripped of its market manipulating fee changes and ""soft"" fork implementation, I'm open to considering elements of SegWit to solve things like malleability. It would be great to have an open comparison of unsullied SegWit against alternatives like Flexible Transactions and others. But I can't support a ""soft"" fork implementation of any activation percentage that only assesses a very small subset of the Bitcoin community (the miners), and that would forcibly and progressively remove fully validating capability from non-SegWit nodes in a way that would either be against their will or without their knowledge. I'm also against including technical debt and abusing soft forks for a change that, if adopted, has such a severe and truly ""hard"" affect on those that attempt to opt out. Lastly, I cannot condone Core/Blockstream's lack of ethics and the ideological conflict that their behavior represents relative to Bitcoin's central principles of decentralization, inclusiveness, and anti-fragility. Activating ""soft"" fork SegWit would simply adding another avenue for control that they would undoubtedly abuse.",2016-11-20 03:15:36+00:00,da7r9uf,3.0,t1_da7pcnh,3205.0,btc
99,"&gt; Now you are coming around your points. The amount of storage in a ""Block"" is a distinct subset of resource demand. And Segwit does make it more distinct still. It is true that a post Segwit Bitcoin allocates resources differently. Users who make SPV transactions benefit greatly since the workload for their fraud proofs is partly taken up by full nodes. Transactions between new wallets will be less resource intensive than those between users with 'old' coins. And new full nodes will be able to get up to speed faster as they only have to download older portions of the blockchain on an as needed basis.

Everything you wrote here seems to me to be a desperate attempts at justification. At least it is clear you are now recognizing that SegWit is not a transaction multiplier, it's not a compression scheme, and on a per transaction basis it does not save the Bitcoin network from any data load over the current system. In point of fact, it marginally makes the situation worse.  

&gt; The 'bounty' opportunity comes with LN, with reduced fees for frequent transactors, and fees paid to liquidity providers.  

I think I was unclear in my reference here. By ""bounty"", I'm referring to the practice of paying bounties for finding bugs in code. Currently there's no incentive for a black hat hacker to reveal a vulnerability in SegWit if he or she finds one. However, they can hope that SegWit gets released live, then they have as much as $12+ billion of incentive to exploit any vulnerability they found or will find to potentially steal or extort bitcoin/cash.  

&gt; What do you see as these unnamed risks?  

The risk I see is if a vulnerability exists where an attacker may be able to craft transactions or blocks that can bloat the network with 4 MB blocks straining infrastructure and possibly being leveraging this in combination with other vectors to cause a more devastating attack; and/or it can be used to DDoS the network to block legitimate traffic. These of course are worst case possibilities, and it's possible no such vectors exist, but through complexity and by adding a new limit at 4 MB, SegWit legitimately creates or increases vectors which were more manageable previously, or which did not exist before.  

&gt; IMO we are still in need a 'spam filter' and I am not so sure that I want to leave it up to (highly centralized) miners to manage that enterprise.  

I won't deny the possibility, although I've never seen any convincing evidence that any real attempt has been made to use this supposed attack vector. I'm confident that even with Unlimited, the vast majority of community actors could see any abuse as it happens and could reconfigure their nodes to prevent it going forward. That said, I don't support Unlimited to the exclusion of other possible dynamic solutions. The big thing is the community must be open to actually discussing the issues in an open, inclusive, and uncensored way. Crucially, all parties must be open to compromise.  

I'm actually glad that the Blockstream/Core faction have definitively shown unwillingness to participate in this way. They are highlighting to all that they are the immovable obstacle in the Bitcoin community, and I'm hoping it's just a matter of time before they get excised.",2016-11-20 02:41:10+00:00,da7q23y,65.0,t1_da7nhkp,4159.0,btc

This is why there is no multiplication affect, and why SegWit is actually a marginal worsening in the amount of data load on the Bitcoin network.

In particular, when a monopoly repository suppresses developer decentralization through unethical actions and hypocritical positions, alternate implementations are clearly suppressed due only to fear of competition.

Current or even past levels of network decentralization and censorship resistance are maintainable *while* raising the block size limit simply due to the constant march of technological progress.

But for purposes of ""soft"" fork SegWit, Core/Blockstream have already drawn their 95% line in the sand, and the only subset that counts in that horse race is hash rate. Since there's a lot of money/value in mining, it's going to be hard for Core/Blockstream to continue to snow miners. They're gradually waking up to the fact that ""soft"" fork SegWit is not just eroding their control over their own profitability, it locks them in slave chains to Core/Blockstream essentially for good. Based on this, I have a hard time imagining the current 10% - 15% of overall hash rate that will not be supporting SFSW will dwindle. On the contrary, I expect it to grow steadily.

176,"I'm sorry, I thought we were having a discussion *using* words. However it's clear words do not have set meanings for you but are simply misused as tools to smear and deride.  

Your misinterpretation of Bitcoin is as poor as your understanding of basic vocabulary. If any hard fork really ruins the concept of fixed supply, then Bitcoin has had a massive hole in it since the day it was launched, and it's not a hole that Core, Blockstream, or SegWit can ever fix. It's a simple fact that there's no mechanism to prevent a hard fork in Bitcoin. No matter how you try to wave away what may or may not be Bitcoin in your mind, it'll be the market that makes that determination by establishing which tokens have most value and which chain is most useful. No amount of word distortion can alter these simple facts.  

Still, I don't disagree that there's room in the crypto world for all architectures and implementations. It's too bad that two-way pegged side chains are to this day marked by the major flaw of requiring ""federation"". Otherwise, even I would support keeping Bitcoin as Satoshi laid it out, ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,"" while cheering Core/Blockstream's efforts to create their vision of a ""settlement network"" on a trustless Bitcoin side chain.

[Byteball whitepaper](https://byteball.org/Byteball.pdf)  

Apparently Byteball will be using Bitcoin's initial coin distribution:  

&gt; Fair initial distribution  

&gt; When Byteball launches, 98% of all bytes and blackbytes will be distributed to current Bitcoin holders who bother to prove their Bitcoin balances before the launch. No investment is required, you need just to link your Bitcoin and Byteball addresses by making a small BTC payment. Then the number of bytes and blackbytes you receive will be proportional to the balance of your Bitcoin address in the Christmas block — the first Bitcoin block timestamped Dec 25, 2016. The linking phase wil start in early December.

Every time you see a SegWit ""anyone can spend"" transaction, it's information that you formerly could fully examine in detail that you no longer can.

Secondly, if you receive bitcoin that has SegWit transactions in its history, you can no longer validate its transaction chain on your own, since you don't have access to the segregated witness data. You are now trusting other participants which tell you, ""oh, yeah, we validated these, but we won't show you our work anymore, so just trust us"".

Third, this ruins fungibility for these nodes, since coins received without SegWit history are now more valuable than coins that have SegWit transaction history.  

Add to the forgoing that this informational loss will be progressive as SegWit continues to be used post-activation, and it's truly an insidious issue to those that attempt to opt out.",2016-10-31 07:15:17+00:00,d9f2jm3,24.0,t1_d9f2auq,777.0,btc

"" I will be the one losing capability""? What capability? You're validating your own transactions and would only receive those that are not segwit as you're so opposed to it? You have full security. My coins in anyonecan spend outputs are fine as that was in the protocol before segwit.................................................. You're losing out on using segwit, sure!

It's not about what you're doing with your money, it's about what your imposition of a ""soft"" fork is doing to my node's former capability, against my will (or if I was oblivious to these developments, without my knowledge). Before SegWit, I could send and receive *any* bitcoin, and I could validate and access data on *any* bitcoin transaction going back to the Genesis block. After SegWit, I progressively lose those capabilities against my will (or without notifying me if I was ignorant of developments).

1) Do nothing, clearly the simplest option but it means the Bitcoin ecosystem will need to continue dealing with malleability as they have (or haven't in the case of MtGox), and that on-chain scaling will continue to bump against the 1 MB limit.  

2) Allow on-chain scaling to continue, but do not address malleability, while still mitigating the sigops quardratic scaling issue -- this option already adds some complexity, something that should be carefully reviewed by the community.  

3) Some kind of malleability solution (e.g. ""soft"" fork SegWit, hard fork SegWit, Flexible Transactions, something else entirely); which may also include some kind of effective increase in transaction capacity.  

Of the three options, it's pretty clear that #3 will always be the most complex. In ""soft"" fork SegWit, the complexity is there for all to see now in already released code. I don't know what purpose it serves to deny that this complexity exists. Experience has always shown that increasing complexity increases the chances of offering unforeseen attack vectors. Simply sticking your head in the sand does not make the situation go away.",2016-10-28 12:38:23+00:00,d9bboq1,10.0,t1_d9bb8m7,928.0,btc
293,"Well, I hope there is no true avenue, but all we know at this point is SegWit adds a significant amount of code and the potential for 4 MB worth of SegWit data on the new ""soft"" forked ""block""chain. My point is simply that in such cases, unforeseen attack vectors often arise later, or are even known by hackers at present, but are not made known since it'd be more valuable to the hacker to attack when there's an actual financial incentive (i.e. once SegWit is activated on mainnet).",2016-10-28 12:06:35+00:00,d9basnc,8.0,t1_d9bap0b,243.0,btc

354,"&gt; You get a transaction that is valid in one chain but not another. Lots of ways to do this, easiest is to get some coins that were mined on the new chain and use those as an input.  

That is obvious, but it isn't what we were discussing and it sheds no light on your original statement:  

&gt; It doesn't even have to be a replay attack. Someone could split coins and send them to people left behind.  

You spew a lot of words, but the more it is, the more nonsense they seem to amount to.  

&gt; You are fully validating a chain that is meant to be disposed. You are being fooled into thinking it's valid.  

Go on and move those goal posts, it's not helping you find a valid argument.  

&gt; You never have explained why not being able to fully validate this one type of transaction is important when miners are enforcing the rule. And if you care, you update. Tell me why following a dead chain is better than following one that is pruned for you?  

On the contrary, I've explained it numerous times, you just are trying hard to not hear the truth: what's important is these nodes are having capability and security that they formerly had hijacked by the SegWit ""soft"" fork, something a hard fork would not cause.  

&gt; This is what happens when you group. I am greatly hoping for an exit from people who clearly don't want Bitcoin and just seek to cause trouble. The fact that they haven't has showed me that they don't want to exit, just cause trouble.  

The only thing I and many here in /r/btc want is what was originally set down in the Bitcoin white paper, and the principles consistent with that. Those principles are made a mockery of by your faction's use of censorship, banning, DDoS, Sybil attacks, and its ignoring massive conflict of interest. Worse, your faction claims that strangling Bitcoin by maintaining the block size limit is in the name of decentralization while ignoring the currently most centralized aspect of Bitcoin, the single monopoly software repository that is Bitcoin Core.

&gt; See Ethereum. How clean was that?  

Nice strawman, though even in Ethereum's case, the sky hasn't yet fallen as was promised by Maxwell among others.  

&gt; No they can't. If you can't read code, you can't discern it.  

You're so full of it. Put down the principles of SegWit next to the block size, and you'll see the difference in complexity without a single line of code.  

&gt; Yes. There's less code than in a hard fork (assuming it's actually an effort to coordinate and signal).  

Right, pull the other one. As if ""soft"" fork code doesn't have signaling included as well.  

&gt; FUD  

You're favorite word again, only it's clear you don't know what it means and you just throw it out when you've run out of anything resembling a sensible argument.  

&gt; It's not FUD if it's actually happening. See ETH.  

Point out exactly what is wrong with the smoothly executed short-notice hard forks (yes plural) executed in the Ethereum community. Things seem to be going quite smoothly from my perspective.  

&gt; Maybe you should ask someone who has seen the code. The hard fork scenario is vastly more complex and results in a messier break.

355,"&gt; It doesn't even have to be a replay attack. Someone could split coins and send them to people left behind.

Based on your definition of your terms, your original statement makes even less sense. Care to explain what you mean and how it would be possible?  

&gt; So basically, the same thing as a hard fork, except they only get a slight degradation rather than being completely fucked.  

You don't seem to get it, and I'm not sure if it's that you're just not capable of it, or if you're trying really hard to stay ignorant. In a hard fork, participants on both post-fork chains can stay fully validating. In the case of a ""soft"" fork, one class has their fully validating capability forcibly revoked against their will.  

&gt; If you are proposing no forks ever, including soft forks, then let me know.  

This is particularly funny, since it's your faction that seems to want to deny hard forks at all costs. But when asked if they think no hard forks will ever be required, they're forced to admit they will have to happen at some point (and that they can never be prevented from happening at any time).  

&gt; There is nothing clean about a messy hard fork.  

And there's nothing intelligent about a stupid statement.  

&gt; What is your expertise on what is over-engineered or not? It's actually quite simple.  

That's just it, even lay persons can discern how complex SegWit is. If all it's trying to do is fix malleability, is all the code and complexity and upgrading really necessary? How can anyone be sure there're no bugs hiding in the multitude of new code? Meanwhile, FUD gets spread about the ""danger"" of hard forks, particularly one just to remove the block size limit.

Glad to see you acknowledge that a hard fork is *always* a choice. Most of your small block brethren like to ignore the possibility at all costs. From their ""ignore the hard fork possibility"" perspective, such nodes would be forced to update to SegWit Core if they wanted to stay fully validating. They would have their former complete transaction viewing and validating capabilities hijacked through no faults or actions of their own, and they'd lose security without recourse (*except for a subsedquent hard fork, which would require an informed, affirmative act*.) So why not make the choice clear to all from the start, and offer a hard fork SegWit in the cleanest way possible? Although, I still think this might be jumping the gun, as other transaction malleability solutions may prove to be much more efficient.

389,"Look, I'm not here to teach you Bitcoin, and from the fact that you can't seem to grok ""trustless"", I'm not sure I'd even be able to if I wanted to. The fact of the matter is such a node will not be able to access SegWit script signatures in SegWit blocks (i.e. the ""segregated witness"" data) and therefore it wouldn't be able to validate such transactions for itself. Prior to the SegWit ""soft"" fork, the node in question *would have been* able to see all transaction signatures and to validate them fully. The multitude of ways this might be exploited is likely not even fully known yet, but it's clear that such a node has much more attack surface available than a node that is trustless and fully validating. Further, it now has less capability to mine information on transactions from it's own block history than it did formerly, and the coins it receives from this point on are no longer truly fungible (i.e. coins received that have no SegWit transaction history would be more valuable to such a node because their histories could still be fully validated, whereas coins received with SegWit histories would rely on SPV-type delegated trust.) Presumably, the ways current SPV wallets can get attacked where current full node wallets would be immune would be the types of vectors that such nodes would be vulnerable to.  

However, the most important point is, such nodes may suffer this loss in validation capability and security *through no choice or action of their own and they would have no recourse once the ""soft"" fork activates*.

In fact, even if the ""anyone can spend"" tag was applied wholely accuately, the non-SegWit complying node still can no longer see the entire transaction history of received coins based on its own received block history, as it is completely unaware of the existence of the segregated data.

Alternatively, they could receive coins that *have* SegWit history, in which case when they try to verify, they'll repeatedly encounter ""anyone can spend"" instead of actual transactions. Basically, they're left with a black hole where information used to be, and they have to just trust that the ""anyone can spend"" is an accurate and honest replacement. Even if that turns out to be the case, they can never retrieve the full transaction histories that they previously could have from just their node's block history.

&gt;Borrowing by the Treasury is done through the issuance of shorter-term notes, called bills, and longer-term bonds. The bonds have a maturity of as long as 30 years. Treasury bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, and as such are popular investments by governments, companies and individuals worldwide. The global market for the instruments was an estimated $12.9 billion at the end of 2015.  

Unless they were sold privately to specific parties, they were probably traded on a bond exchange someplace. Anyone interested in US Treasury bills or bonds could buy them at the prevailing rate.

After the fork you may have to take some action to avoid [replay attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack). It's possible the forking code will employ measures to prevent replay attacks, in which case further user action would be unnecessary, but if not, keeping your funds safe from replay attack is fairly simple as explained in [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4vbsgi/what_is_replay_attack/d5xhibt). I would bet that as the possibility of a hard chain fork approaches, simpler and cleaner solutions based on lock time op codes will be made available (the specifics of which may depend on the difficulty differences on the post-fork chains, and on any new difficulty policy that might be implemented in the forking code).

The electronic units used by the system are variously considered to be a type of commodity, asset, or currency by governmental agencies. It's the first such system in history with controlled, verifiable issuance of such an electronic token, where that token can be spent free of counterfeiting and double-spending, and where this is accomplished *without any central controlling agency or mint* (no central bank or treasury) mandating or guaranteeing it. Instead, Bitcoin functioning as intended is ensured by the consensus of the protocol all its users employ and by mathematically provable cryptography. The system consists of [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), and is designed to be entirely decentralized.  

Bitcoin pioneered the technical innovation which permits all of this, known as a [blockchain, or originally a ""block chain""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database). Bitcoin, other crypto-currencies largely based on its design, and particularly the blockchain technology itself, are attracting increasing interest from academia, major financial/technology companies, and governments.

I follow what you're saying about needing to bake in true fungibility at the protocol level, but I suppose I'm still on the fence to see what kind of approximation of that fungibility can be added as a layer (or even if such fungibility can work in a sidechain, should those ever actually materialize). There are conceivably use-cases or innovation that do not require ultimate fungibility (or indeed rely on *traceability*) which would then gain from Bitcoin's relative on-chain efficiencies.  

I'm with you on the whole ""LN is Bitcoin"" false narrative. I hope it turns out to be useful, but tokens locked up in LN channels are distinctly different from on-chain tokens. LN absolutely should stand alone as a free choice, and not be forced upon users via centralized manipulations.

I definitely find Monero interesting, but I'm not yet sold that it is sure to unseat an *unhindered* Bitcoin. Still, if things don't change soon, that won't be a concern for any altcoin. I'll continue to watch Monero with interest, and may even take up a position in it.

594,"&gt; What does that mean? When a loan has a negative interest rate, the borrower’s payments actually add up to less than the original debt. Several central banks (including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan) have experimented with such policies. For savers, it has the opposite effect: Money left in a bank deposit or a money-market fund keeps shrinking because of negative interest rates.  
&gt; 
&gt; In principle, cutting interest rates below zero ought to stimulate consumption and investment in the same way as normal monetary policy, by encouraging borrowing. Unfortunately, the existence of cash gums up the works. If you are a saver, you will simply withdraw your funds, turning them into cash, rather than watch them shrink too rapidly. Enormous sums might be withdrawn to avoid these loses, which could make it difficult for banks to make loans—thus defeating the whole purpose of the policy.  
&gt; 
&gt; Take cash away, however, or make the cost of hoarding high enough, and central banks would be free to drive rates as deep into negative territory as they needed in a severe recession. People could still hoard small bills, but the costs would likely be prohibitive for any realistic negative interest rate. If necessary, central banks could also slap temporary fees on any large withdrawals and deposits of paper currency.  
&gt; 
&gt; Economists generally like the idea of adding negative interest rates to the tool kit of central banks. John Maynard Keynes weighed it quite seriously in his great work “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money” (1936). He was writing, however, in an era before electronic banking, so he saw it as a thoroughly impractical idea.  
&gt; 
&gt; Not everyone likes negative rates. There is particularly strong resistance from the financial sector, which worries about the difficulty of passing negative rates on to small depositors. But these concerns can be significantly alleviated. Banks could be compensated for allowing zero-interest rate deposits of up to, say, $2,000 per citizen.  
&gt; 
&gt; Others worry that negative rates will push banks, if not the entire financial sector, to engage in reckless risk-taking, which is threat enough with interest rates at zero. But if a strong dose of negative rates can power an economy out of a downturn, it could bring inflation and interest rates back to positive levels relatively quickly, arguably reducing vulnerability to bubbles rather than increasing it.  
&gt; 
&gt; In sum, there are many issues to take into account, but if done gradually and properly, the balance of arguments is distinctly in favor of becoming a society that depends much less on cash.  
&gt; 
&gt; Will it ever happen? I believe the time has come. Finance ministries are desperate to collect more tax revenues without raising tax rates. Homeland-security agencies are concerned about how cash facilitates terrorist financing. Justice departments are as worried as ever about the role of cash in crime. For immigration authorities, it sure beats building walls.  
&gt; 
&gt; Cash is intimately familiar to all of us, woven into the fabric of our lives and our experiences as consumers and businesspeople. But governments have let cash supplies get way out of hand, to the benefit of criminals and tax evaders everywhere. It is time, at last, to get rid of all those $100 bills.

595,"&gt; The Sinister Side of Cash  
&gt; Paper money fuels corruption, terrorism, tax evasion and illegal immigration—so the U.S. should get rid of the $100 bill and other large notes  
&gt; 
&gt; By KENNETH S. ROGOFF  
&gt; Aug. 25, 2016 11:08 a.m. ET  
&gt; 750 COMMENTS  
&gt; 
&gt; When I tell people that I have been doing research on why the government should drastically scale back the circulation of cash—paper currency—the most common initial reaction is bewilderment. Why should anyone care about such a mundane topic? But paper currency lies at the heart of some of today’s most intractable public-finance and monetary problems. Getting rid of most of it—that is, moving to a society where cash is used less frequently and mainly for small transactions—could be a big help.  
&gt; 
&gt; There is little debate among law-enforcement agencies that paper currency, especially large notes such as the U.S. $100 bill, facilitates crime: racketeering, extortion, money laundering, drug and human trafficking, the corruption of public officials, not to mention terrorism. There are substitutes for cash—cryptocurrencies, uncut diamonds, gold coins, prepaid cards—but for many kinds of criminal transactions, cash is still king. It delivers absolute anonymity, portability, liquidity and near-universal acceptance. It is no accident that whenever there is a big-time drug bust, the authorities typically find wads of cash.  
&gt; 
&gt; Cash is also deeply implicated in tax evasion, which costs the federal government some $500 billion a year in revenue. According to the Internal Revenue Service, a lot of the action is concentrated in small cash-intensive businesses, where it is difficult to verify sales and the self-reporting of income. By contrast, businesses that take payments mostly by check, bank card or electronic transfer know that it is much easier for tax authorities to catch them dissembling. Though the data are much thinner for state and local governments, they too surely lose big-time from tax evasion, perhaps as much as $200 billion a year.  
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously, scaling back cash is not going to change human nature, and there are other ways to dodge taxes and run illegal businesses. But there can be no doubt that flooding the underground economy with paper currency encourages illicit behavior.  
&gt; 
&gt; Cash also lies at the core of the illegal immigration problem in the U.S. If American employers couldn’t so easily pay illegal workers off the books in cash, the lure of jobs would abate, and the flow of illegal immigrants would shrink drastically. Needless to say, phasing out most cash would be a far more humane and sensible way of discouraging illegal immigration than constructing a giant wall.  
&gt; 
&gt; To be clear, I am proposing a “less-cash” society, not a cashless one, at least for the foreseeable future. The first stage of the transition would involve very gradually phasing out large denomination bills that constitute the bulk of the currency supply. Of the more than $4,200 in cash that is circulating outside financial institutions for every man, woman and child in the U.S., almost 80% of it is in $100 bills. In turn, $50 and $20 bills would also be phased out, though $10s, $5s and $1s would be kept indefinitely. Today these smaller bills constitute just 3% of the value of the currency supply.  
&gt; 
&gt; The point of getting rid of big bills is to make it harder to carry and store large amounts. A million dollars in $100 bills weighs approximately 22 pounds and can fit comfortably into a large shopping bag. With $10 bills, it isn’t so easy. Think of lugging around 220 pounds in a giant chest. Hoarders and tax evaders would find small notes proportionately costlier to count, verify, handle and store. The use of cash could be further discouraged by putting restrictions on the maximum size of cash payments allowed in retail sales.  
&gt; 
&gt; The fact that large notes are used far more for illegal activities than for legal ones long ago penetrated television, movies and popular culture. Viewers of the television series “Breaking Bad,” about a high-school chemistry teacher turned crystal-meth drug lord, got a fair taste of how cash is earned, spent and laundered in criminal activities.  
&gt; 
&gt; Policy makers have been far slower to acknowledge this reality. They point to the popularity of U.S. currency abroad, particularly in some governance-challenged countries like Russia, where it is not unusual to pay for an apartment with a briefcase full of U.S. $100s. At one time, the Fed and the Treasury insisted that foreign demand explained as much as 70% of the demand for U.S. currency. But this argument has withered in the face of cross-country evidence, which suggests that at least a large fraction of dollars must be held in the U.S. underground economy (as I showed in a research paper almost two decades ago). Even the Fed now estimates that less than half of all dollars are abroad.  
&gt; 
&gt; If cash is so bad, why retain small bills of $10 and under? For one thing, cash still accounts for more than half of retail purchases under $10, though the share fades off sharply as payment size rises, with debit cards, credit cards, electronic transfers and checks all far more important than cash for (legal, tax-compliant) payments over $100.  
&gt; 
&gt; Many low-income individuals still rely heavily on cash, although of course they aren’t the ones carrying wads of $100s. It wouldn’t cost much to have the government or financial institutions provide them with debit cards. This would also make it simpler, safer and less expensive for the government to make transfer payments. Several Scandinavian countries have already taken this step.  
&gt; 
&gt; Retaining small notes alleviates a host of problems that might arise if cash were eliminated entirely. For example, cash is still handy if a hurricane or natural disaster knocks out the power grid. Most disaster-preparation manuals call for people to keep some cash on hand, warning that ATMs might be paralyzed.  
&gt; 
&gt; But times are changing. Nowadays, cell towers and large retail stores typically have backup generators, allowing them to process bank cards during a power outage. And there are always checks. In due time, smartphone technology is likely to overtake all other media, and one can always keep a spare charging cell for emergencies.  
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps the most challenging and fundamental objection to getting rid of cash has to do with privacy—with our ability to spend anonymously. But where does one draw the line between this individual right and the government’s need to tax and regulate and to enforce the law? Most of us wouldn’t want to clamp down on someone’s right to make the occasional $200 purchase in complete privacy. But what about a $50,000 car or a $1 million apartment? We should be able to reduce the problems I’ve described here while also ensuring that ordinary people can still use small bills for convenience in everyday transactions.  
&gt; 
&gt; Won’t the private sector continually find new ways to make anonymous transfers that sidestep government restrictions? Certainly. But as long as the government keeps playing Whac-A-Mole and prevents these alternative vehicles from being easily used at retail stores or banks, they won’t be able fill the role that cash plays today. Forcing criminals and tax evaders to turn to riskier and more costly alternatives to cash will make their lives harder and their enterprises less profitable.  
&gt; 
&gt; Some might argue that scaling back U.S. dollars will work only if there is coordination among all the major economies, since American criminals and tax evaders will just turn to euros if they have to. This is very unlikely. Few U.S. retail outlets accept euros, banks already have to file reports on large cash deposits, and there is a $10,000 cap on how much cash you can bring into the U.S. or take out without filing a customs form.  
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, the U.S. government saves on borrowing costs by printing lots of money as opposed to issuing Treasury bonds, which must pay interest. But the effect of that flood of cash is to make life easier for Russian oligarchs, Mexican drug lords and global human-trafficking operations. The higher revenue from eliminating cash (and thus much tax evasion) would likely exceed the revenue that the U.S. Treasury currently gets from greasing the wheels of global crime, and there would be huge direct and indirect benefits from lower crime rates. In any event, if the U.S. took the lead, other advanced nations would eventually be shamed into following suit.  
&gt; 
&gt; The tax and crime angle is reason enough to shred the world’s mountains of paper currency. There is, however, a very different and perhaps surprising rationale, having to do with the ability of central banks to deal with financial crises and deep recessions. Why? Because for all the polemical debate surrounding fiscal policy, monetary policy remains much the preferred first line of defense in dealing with recessions.  
&gt; 
&gt; Cutting interest rates delivers quick and effective stimulus by giving consumers and businesses an incentive to borrow more. It also drives up the price of stocks and homes, which makes people feel wealthier and induces them to spend more. Countercyclical monetary policy has a long-established record, while political constraints will always interfere with timely and effective fiscal stimulus.  
&gt; 
&gt; ‘Almost 80% of the cash circulating outside financial institutions is in $100 bills’  
&gt; 
&gt; Since 2008, however, monetary policy has started to look less and less nimble. Most central banks found that once they brought interest rates down to (around) zero, their remaining options were very limited. This has left many central banks wishing that they had the capacity to take interest rates below zero.

599,"&gt; Does it really matter?...  

That's the question exactly, and according to another response in this thread, LN will be applicable to Monero (though it apparently doesn't yet have the needed multisig). So depending on how effective LN is should it ever appear, it could help alleviate concerns about somewhat poorer on-chain scaling, though I do think it still matters exactly *how much* poorer we're really talking about.  

&gt; The last part I'm interested in also.  

The word is its apparently doable and work is progressing, but I suppose the proof will be in the pudding. This is crypto, so my default position is to assume vapor until a usable implementation is available.

600,"Thanks for the detailed reply.  

&gt; If you have questions about Monero you really should make the thread in /r/monero, or even the new stack exchange for Monero.  

I have browsed but not spent extensive time in either place. I figured since I was seeing more and more Monero related comments here I'd inquire here to see why that might be happening.  

&gt; Transactions are larger than bitcoin transactions...  

If Bitcoin's 1 MB limit is left in place, I bet it'd be hard to find *any* altcoin that doesn't have a scaling advantage. But without the block size limit, or with a practical growing or dynamic limit, Bitcoin is among the best options (if not *the* best option) for on-chain scaling, is it not?  

The more ASIC resistant PoW is attractive, although there's always the botnet concern. But a hard fork to raise Bitcoin's block size limit may make a change of PoW necessary here as well.  

Do you know what the motivation of Monero's regular periodic forks is? Is it just to regularly change PoW to minimize miner centralization?  

&gt; They don't exist yet, but from what I'm told, not impossible  

Thanks for the SE link. Some responses there raise an interesting point: Light/SPV clients are needed for usability, but by nature sacrifice some of Monero's fungibility/privacy. This raises the basic philosophical difference of adding fungibility as a layer on top of a coin (as in Bitcoin), or having it built-in (like Monero), then needing to strip some of it away to allow real-world wallet apps. Assuming scaling and developer centralization can ever be addressed, I'm still partial to the former concept.  

And it has to be said that although light/SPV wallets are claimed to be possible, they have yet to be demonstrated on mainnet (much like SegWit and LN from Core).  

&gt; That was by Rudd-X...  

Thanks for the source. I originally saw it posted to the /r/Bitcoin echo chamber, so I expected potential FUD content. I'll have to look over the claims more closely, but even accounting for exaggeration, there does seem to be reason to be more concerned about these issues in Monero than in Bitcoin (should the BSL issue ever get addressed, of course).  

&gt; Yes, it will be once multisig is rolled out.  

Well that's good to know. So if LN lives up to its promises, this could be even more important to an altcoin that doesn't scale quite as well on-chain. Any reason to think multisig in Monero will be more problematic than for Bitcoin? Will it compound the added verification overhead further? I think I've heard there's no malleability issue in Monero, so LN could theoretically be deployed there first.

There is no hard cap on the final number of Monero units, and there will always be *some* inflation. Block time is targeted at 120 seconds, and there is no block size limit, though Monero scales worse than Bitcoin would if it had no block size limit. According to the [SatoshiLabs website](https://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-faq/overview.html) (scroll to the bottom), Trezor currently does not support Monero, and I don't know if it is on the development road map.

625,"I recognize his contributions, but take issue with the leadership role he has adopted and which others seem to recognize. I'd be happy to have him continue to contribute as a developer even if Bitcoin forks away from Core (and by extension, Blockstream), but I would be against him having the final say (or any outsized influence) when it comes to the Bitcoin protocol.  

&gt; Yes, some behaviour is questionable, undoubtedly - but it is only questionable because people don't fully understand/agree with it. It does not mean it is poison.  

/u/nullc is seemingly incapable of being forthright and straightforward, and he apparently condones and even inspires similar behavior in those around him. I strongly disagree with your contention that his behavior is only ""questionable"", and then only because it is misunderstood. Let's examine the issues he refuses to fully address or even discuss:  

1) The colossal conflict of interest (or at the very least, the massive *appearance* thereof) that his company, a heavily VC-funded private, for-profit organization of which he is listed as the co-founder and CTO, casts over the entire Bitcoin project by directly paying/employing many Bitcoin Core developers (arguably the most active and influential ones). In most financial spheres the world over this would be highly improper and in most cases, blatantly illegal. Regardless of the obvious impropriety, Maxwell and Blockstream are happy to flout the objections of substantial portions of the Bitcoin community without ever even addressing this massive issue. Further, they continue to lead Core's abuse of its incumbent position to stall raising the block size limit. This collusion suppresses general development of Bitcoin in mainstream use-cases, denies fair competition among alternative scaling solutions, and even hamstrings free and open use of the Bitcoin network. In total, Maxwell-lead actions are leading to the loss of Bitcoin's first-mover advantage, and driving users to alternatives that are not similarly self-handicapped.  

2) His refusal to act in a moral, ethical and principled way, either personally, or by directing Blockstream, its Core dev employees, or even his followers among the Bitcoin community to denounce underhanded, disingenuous, and exclusionary practices. This includes but is not limited to tacit (and arguably even active) support of censorship in vast swathes of Bitcoin forums (i.e. /r/Bitcoin among numerous others -- as best put in [this deleted /r/Bitcoin comment from /u/MortuusBestia](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-677#post-23743), ""*A policy of enforced ignorance is not productive to rational Bitcoin discussion.*""); refusal to denounce (and even support backhandedly) DDoS'ing or Sybil attacking of Bitcoin client implementations that compete with Core; support for ostracizing respected members of the Bitcoin community (e.g. Andresen, Garzik, Hearn, etc.) because of their dissenting views; embrace of private, closed-door, behind-the-scenes negotiations with miners and industry; refusal to support free-market competition and even actively skewing market effects (e.g. stalling and not discussing raising the 1 MB block size limit, manipulating free market selection via SegWit's witness data fee discount, etc.); and most recently his lack of acknowledgement of the impropriety of a single, private, for-profit company dominating ""defensive"" patents for Bitcoin-related technology.  

3) The continued hypocritical positions and false narratives put forth directly by himself, Blockstream employees, collaborators, or proxies. To wit:  

* That raising the 1 MB block size limit will result in catastrophic loss of decentralization for Bitcoin, ignoring that simple continued advances in technology can allow for block sizes to increase at *some* rate without any loss of decentralization. In fact, Maxwell refuses to even discuss specifics when decentralization metrics are raised.  

* That decentralization of Bitcoin is critical while supporting (or at least refusing to speak against) unethical actions aimed at ensuring Bitcoin's current most centralized aspect: the dominance of a single incumbent software repository for its development. Not surprisingly, such a position abets Blockstream's effective capture over Bitcoin's current state.  

* That a ""contentious"" hard fork (i.e. by Blockstream definition one without 95%+ community support) would lead to disaster, chaos, and profound loss of funds for general Bitcoin users. The falsehood of this contention has been amply demonstrated by the disaster-free transition in the recent ""contentious"" Ethereum hard fork (a time-pressured, rushed fork with a far more divisive premise).  

4) His own penchant for combative, uncivil engagement as opposed to forthright, honest discourse. This is clearly seen in his constant unsubstantiated disparagement of this uncensored /r/btc subreddit as a ""cesspool"", among other frequent and habitual demonstrations (while he hypocritically spends much of his recent time participating here). This aspect of his personality seems deeply ingrained, as [copious documentation of his prior involvement with Wikipedia editors abundantly demonstrates](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45ail1/wikipedians_on_greg_maxwell_in_2006_now_cto_of/) (a couple of other [detailed collections of background,](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/459iyw/gmaxwell_in_2006_during_his_wikipedia_vandalism/) also [courtesy of /u/ydtm](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4klqtg/people_are_starting_to_realize_how_toxic_gregory/)).

Still, the practicality of paying for/implementing a sustained DDoS for the chance of defrauding an LN transaction seems quite small (except perhaps for an LN transaction of very high value), particularly if the channel has a long remaining nLockTime. Most everyone has more than one access point to the Internet available, so even a sustained and powerful DDoS is no guarantee that such an attack would be successful.  

As counterpoint, there are also impractical high-effort attacks against on-chain Bitcoin transactions that are possible. Admittedly, the LN attacks are generally *less* impractical, but if LN works, you're just giving up some things (i.e. security, decentralization, truly unencumbered bitcoin, etc.) to get other things (i.e. instant transactions, micropayments, payment volume scalability, etc.)

644,"OK, before I get into this too far with you, I just want to state that I do have doubts about LN, especially the purported truly decentralized version. At the same time, I think there is promise here as well. Whether any implementation will live up to some or all of this promise is an open question.  

&gt; You're missing the point. The endpoints by design must be live hot wallets. If you can attack both endpoints, you can steal the Bitcoin in the channel.  

So you're saying hot wallets (including those used to facilitate LN) are vulnerable, but not that LN itself allows more avenues of theft? OK, agreed. Still it seems that LN only requires signatures, and those signatures can be provided from a secure source like a Trezor, so there may be mitigations of this risk that are possible for LN.  

&gt; She then uses her original anti fraud transaction to close the channel and get her funds back, after the timelock expires.  

This can't happen because in order to complete the LN transaction in the first place, Bob would've received a reduced nLockTime transaction signed by Alice entitling him to the correct new balance before Alice's old nLockTime expires (or the equivalent depending on which direction the channel is being used.) Once an LN transaction completes, the *best* signed but unpublished transactions held by each side only entitle them to remaining balance specified by the last LN exchange itself. The only way this can really be cheated is if each/either party's LN wallet is disrupted from checking that nLockTime transactions closing the channel from the other party have been published or confirmed, but properly coded LN wallets should be programmed to notify the user and/or automatically publish their superior remedies if they discover they can no longer correctly verify from the Bitcoin network.",2016-08-15 21:40:04+00:00,d6iv3vb,7.0,t1_d6it655,2602.0,btc

Perhaps no one, but that might not be a show-stopper.  

The problem is the ""ad-hoc mesh network"" is entirely theoretical at this point. If it gets implemented in a centralized routing fashion, the routing infrastructure could get attacked. Implementing it in a truly decentralized way seems to me to be quite a pipe dream, as the complexity involved in choosing routes based on all variables (i.e. balance of existing channels, remaining nLockTime, fees, number of hops, network and node reliability, etc.) is not even beginning to be addressed in current proposals.

&gt; 
&gt; Preparing for a World Without Cash  
&gt; The Federal Reserve has done almost nothing to study how a digital currency might work.  
&gt; 
&gt; By MAX RASKIN and  DAVID YERMACK  
&gt; Aug. 4, 2016 7:24 p.m. ET  
&gt; 25 COMMENTS  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Central bankers throughout the world, from Canada to Ireland, have recently indicated that they might issue digital currency in the future. Yet the U.S. has been absent from the debate. As the world’s central monetary power, America should play a leading role in studying the benefits and pitfalls of a digital-currency future. While plenty of risks would come with such a conversion, the potential perks are so great that it merits serious consideration.  
&gt; 
&gt; What would a government-backed digital currency look like? A country’s central bank would need to become a deposit-taking institution and hold accounts on behalf of citizens and businesses. All of their debits would be tracked on the central bank’s blockchain, a digital ledger resistant to tampering. The central bank would pay interest electronically by adjusting the balances of depositor accounts. While the current system of physical notes and bills could be continued in parallel, it would likely wind down over time.  
&gt; 
&gt; Though such a system seems relatively simple, implementation wouldn’t be easy. In “Digital Currencies, Decentralized Ledgers, and the Future of Central Banking,” a new paper prepared for a forthcoming research anthology on central banking, we analyze potential costs and benefits of a sovereign digital currency.  
&gt; 
&gt; There are plenty of advantages. The government would save nearly $1 billion annually by not having to print, store, transport and safeguard physical currency. Tax collection would become much simpler, and tax evasion and money laundering could become prohibitively difficult. Depositors would no longer have to rely on commercial banks to hold their checking accounts, and the government could get out of the risky deposit-insurance business. Commercial banks that wished to keep making loans would raise long-term capital in the debt and equity markets, ending the mismatch between demand deposits and long-term loans that can cause liquidity problems.  
&gt; 
&gt; Central banks would be able to expand credit and control the monetary system without the need for commercial banks to intermediate. The central bank could more easily adjust its monetary policy, because it would have the ability to target specific accounts. For example, the Fed could loosen monetary policy only in economically depressed regions of the country, or for certain depositors, such as senior citizens.  
&gt; 
&gt; Yet the centralization of banking under this system would also create a Leviathan with the power to monitor and control the personal finances of every citizen in the country. This is one of the chief reasons why many are loath to give up on hard currency. With digital money, the government could view any financial transaction and obtain a flow of information about personal spending that could be used against an individual in a whole host of scenarios. In other words, it would be virtually impossible to hide money under your mattress. But creating and respecting privacy firewalls and rethinking legal-tender laws could mitigate the dangers of monopoly and stifled competition in currency markets.  
&gt; 
&gt; Implementation would probably create the toughest problems. Today bitcoin and other digital currencies are mostly used by relatively affluent men between the ages of 19 and 44. Not all citizens would be comfortable switching to a virtual currency, and the poor and computer-illiterate would be most vulnerable to being left behind. To accommodate these users, the U.S. Mint could place a digital token in each newly issued dollar bill, with a cryptographic key embedded in a hologram to enable digital tracking on the central bank’s blockchain. Such physical manifestations of digital currency already exist in the bitcoin market and would allow individuals to participate in a scheme of digital currency without having to change their behavior.  
&gt; 
&gt; However, a transition to digital currency might come at a large cost for the U.S. in particular, because the dollar remains the world’s de facto reserve currency. The U.S. collects enormous seigniorage revenue that accrues to the economy when the Federal Reserve prints dollars that are exported abroad in exchange for foreign goods and services. These bank notes ultimately end up in countries with less reliable central banks where locals prefer to hold U.S. currency instead of their own. Forfeiting this franchise as the world’s reserve currency might be too costly, as the U.S. currency held abroad exceeds half a trillion dollars, according to reliable estimates. Unless it is prepared to take deposits from people all over the world who are looking for safe havens, the Fed might sit on the sidelines and watch other countries take the lead in replacing their physical money with digital.  
&gt; 
&gt; Despite its shortcomings, would this system make sense for the U.S.? With less physical currency being used every year, the Federal Reserve would be negligent not to consider the possibilities. The march of digital commerce may eventually make the benefits seem overwhelming, and it would be wise to be ahead of the game rather than trying to catch up at the last minute.

673,"Surges in numbers of transactions will be dramatically less likely to create unpredictable surges in transaction fees. Business ventures considering using Bitcoin will see that it is capable of organic growth rather than being arbitrarily strangled by a subset of the community. Attempts to DDoS the network via spam transaction attacks become more difficult and costly. Block size headroom will allow normal growth rates and permit the network to take advantage of advances in technology. In short, the network becomes more stable, reliable, and flexible. It will be restored to how it has functioned stably for 6.5 years of its 7 year life.  

And all this would be achieved without negatively impacting further scaling innovation one whit.

674,"With satellite internet you likely have a limited data cap, which is another reason you should not run a full node.

You also should be wary of using such an instance as the sole source for high-value transaction verification, since it could also be manipulated by anyone with server or network access.

The one you dodged. To wit:  

&gt; &gt; Then explain exactly how much additional capacity you believe Bitcoin has available right now. Are any altcoins currently operating under similar limitations?

Main chain can't be a settlement layer and a ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system"" at the same time. Pick one. I pick the one promised to us from the beginning.  

&gt; Bitcoin functionalities can be greatly expanded via trustless payment channels and sidechains while the main chain can be kept elegant as possible. As long as second layer remains trustless and you don't have to give your custody of fund to a third party, it is also Bitcoin.

This indicates that Coinbase is not properly separating the two coins (ETH and ETC), or they are sending in a way that makes them vulnerable to replay attacks.  

The way this attack is getting leveraged is, users buy ETH at Coinbase, send to Poloniex and sometimes get ETH and ETC. Sell the ETC for BTC, transfer to Coinbase and buy more ETH, which when sent to Poloniex again sometimes credited as both ETH and ETC. Rinse and repeat as long as you receive free ETC.

I never claimed that it was up to *my* judgement. I put forth it would be up to the majority of the hashing network to create the chain with the most work, thereby determining which chain is more legitimate, provided it was given the chance to make this determination via a fork.  

&gt; Let me remind you, in this conversation you're the one that want to fork, not me.  

Looked at historically, Bitcoin right now *is* the fork, as it did not start out with the 1 MB block size limit. So if it makes you any happier, we're seeking to *unfork* Bitcoin.  

But more to the point, Bitcoin right now is being hijacked by a subset of its community to transform it into a ""settlement layer"" instead of the originally envisioned ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system"".

787,"&gt; Well, that is not what we are seeing with ETC/ETH.  

What? Look at what I wrote again. In this case, ETH pre-fork price was about ~0.0187 BTC. Post-fork ETC has ranged between ~0.00038 and ~0.0043 BTC. So even at the extreme high range of its valuation so far, ETC has always been worth at least 77% less than ETH tokens were immediately pre-fork (and taking real-time ETC value right now, the actual figure is 87%+ less). I think when I wrote ""worth much less,"" I made an accurate assessment.  

&gt; What we are seeing is that the market price will move without much regard for the hashpower. Then the miners will switch between coins, searching for the maximum revenue, trying to keep the hashrate of each coin roughly proportional to its market price (as theory predicts).  

Your two sentences here seem like they may even contradict each other, however I think what you're observing is simple market volatility fueled by speculation, which results in mining on ETC sometimes being more valuable, whereas other times mining on ETH is more profitable.

836,"That to me is hairsplitting, and the reason why the ""soft fork"" versus ""hard fork"" language simply obscures debate. If you include ""soft"" or ""hard"" labels, there's always ambiguity which affords weasling in subsequent discussions. Let's take a look at what you just wrote as an example:  

&gt; Since more restrictive rules create blocks that are a subset of the allowed blocks before the softfork, the group that wants to remain on the original rules needs to hardfork in order to not reorganize to the softfork chaintip if that has more mining power.  

To begin with, I already stated that anyone wanting to remain on the original chain at that point would've needed to be unconcerned about operating with a minority hash rate, much like Ethereum Classic today.  

So you're essentially saying that this ""soft fork"" was just an unrealized ""hard fork"", since for some time after that ""soft fork"" was declared complete, I bet there were still older clients on the network that had not upgraded (and almost certainly some among miners). The only reason there wasn't an actual chain fork is the average block sizes at the time were still more than 100x smaller than the 1 MB limit. Had any miner still running pre-fork code elected to mine a &gt; 1 MB block to make a point, that would've been a chain fork, AKA a ""hard fork"".

It'd be costly for the attackers, but it would be disruptive while arguably not being criminal, since miners are free to choose how they mine.  

It would also drive up difficulty while they attack. As difficulty peaks, the attackers could suddenly stop mining, allowing block times on ETHF to spike, supplying a further disruption.

937,"After I replied to you the first time, I thought about this in more detail, and I realized you may be right in large part. I considered having a channel with 1 btc in it and using it to send microstransactions bi-directionally. I tried to think of a case where one of the two parties could do something that would force the other party to send a transaction to close the channel. In the end I realized this is quite difficult. I think the only way it really can be done is in the reverse direction, and it helps the cheater if the time lock of the channel is short, and also if the incremental changes of the nLockTime are narrow (close to each other) which essentially increases the risk of race situations. Even then the cheater is essentially hoping the other side is not paying attention or the LN wallet is down so that the chance to broadcast a refund/remedy transaction in time is missed--a ridiculous amount of effort if the only thing at stake is a microtransaction. I suppose a large commercial hub could try to do this with a large number of channels at the same time in the attempt to reap a large number of small value transactions, but even then I think the total likely return would be quite low.  

So in effect, especially for microtransactions, the ""attack surface"" is very, very small, perhaps insignificant. The comparatively high transaction fees of Bitcoin still add friction to the system. They still make choosing to collapse a channel early more costly, and they still would incentivize longer nLockTimes, effectively adding cost in terms of the time value of money. However, I now think they don't add much *new* risk when a channel is open and being used for microtransactions as opposed to the same situation with LN microtransactions run on an altcoin. So, I was wrong about there being an amplification or multiplication of the advantage altcoins have over Bitcoin due to higher fees from the 1 MB block size limit. I'll be amending my OP accordingly.  

&gt; Something I haven't figured out how to solve is that if you're going to use lightning trustlessly, you have to be an active Lightning node. You can't be offline and trustlessly receive funds like you can with a Bitcoin address; a sender pings you, you send back a reply, and then the sender can make the actual transaction. So that could be a reason you end up having to trust somebody.  

Yes, this is something I've also come to realize the more I analyze LN. It's very important for the wallet to be active, reliable and for it to have a robust Internet connection. The automated functions of an LN wallet constantly have to check the block chain and perhaps even should monitor mempools, for improperly broadcast transactions from the party on the other side that would require the wallet to broadcast its refund/remedy transaction in response. Further, these wallets could stand human checking or have High Availability monitoring (with possibly the ability send warnings out of band), since any lengthy wallet downtime or disconnection from the Internet could potentially result in lost funds. Of course, the need for such extreme measures would vary depending on the value locked in the channels and how much has been transacted across them.",2016-07-23 14:07:01+00:00,d5nm7pn,2.0,t1_d5niuoi,9415.0,btc
938,"Perhaps ""cheat"" is too strong a word, or not specific enough. The point I'm trying to make is that if transaction fees on the base layer are too high, they may serve to dissuade someone who sent a low value LN transaction from collapsing the channel to recover their funds, even if the transaction did not complete through the LN path due to one of the hubs failing to respond properly. This would simply be because the transaction fee dwarfs the low value transaction, or if a combination of the amount of the transaction fee together with the associated ""time risk of money"" (as Poon puts it) is too great to justify the sender closing and re-opening a new channel with new funds that also must be time locked.  

e: And if this is the case, microtransaction hubs in Bitcoin may realize it and become ""lazy"" in their performance. After all, some significant percentage of transactions they do not complete in good faith, do not end up costing them lost funds as a result of the senders choosing against collapsing channels.",2016-07-23 12:58:02+00:00,d5nkidw,2.0,t1_d5niuoi,5276.0,btc
939,"Yeah, #1 and #3 make sense, though the latency on #1 wouldn't be a big plus (I suppose that's why you'd choose enough space in lock time parameters to avoid possible race conditions). #2 seems like it would erode LN's value proposition, but I suppose it would make sense for particularly high-value channels.  

I was just thinking how solid and reliable an LN wallet client will have to be. For a wallet maintaining one or more high value channels, you may even want heartbeat monitoring on it, perhaps a fallback redundancy.

I'm sorry, but for my money you've not made that clear at all.  

&gt; The refund transaction and the breach remedy transaction are separate things  

Document this for me please, I believe you are mistaken.  

&gt; Yes this is correct, that's why there's no need for a breach remedy  

I don't think so, the first step in opening *any* LN channel is the transfer of the signed Refund nLockTime transaction.  

&gt; There are multiple transactions that are signed as part of the flow. One transaction: the refund, it is for a graceful, but time delayed, exit. The other transaction: the breach remedy, it is for a breach of trust situation where an out of date state is broadcast  

Look, you keep repeating this stuff, but unless you can document it, I'm going to go with what I see from Poon and Dryja.  

&gt; The same goes for the breach remedy transactions: they are only valid on the Blockchain for a potential future state, they are not valid at the time of signing  

Again please document these ""breach remedy transactions"" (from a white paper, web guide, video, something) and illustrate how they are distinct from the known Refund nLockTime transactions.",2016-07-23 08:28:45+00:00,d5ng3yi,16.0,t1_d5ng1nj,238.0,btc

You may be talking about Relative Check Lock Time, which is an op code that Poon and Dryja think would make LN more useful, because it would allow you to constantly extend an open LN channel without first settling to the block chain. It may have other uses, but that's the one they mention in video I linked.",2016-07-23 08:20:14+00:00,d5nfz2y,16.0,t1_d5nfn2x,1214.0,btc
978,"&gt; I'm talking just about where the original funds come from, they come from the Blockchain  

OK, I see. Why are you talking about that?  

&gt; At that point, there's no breach remedy, since both sides are in balance with each other and a breach isn't possible.  

No LN channel has ever been created without the nLockTime Refund transaction signed by the other party. This is the very first step and defines two things, the amount locked in the channel, and the channel duration. With more and more use, the channel duration gets shorter and shorter, and new refund transactions get issued, but this is how it always starts.  

&gt; At that point, there's no breach remedy, since both sides are in balance with each other and a breach isn't possible.  

No, in your example you're talking about one channel from Alice to Bob for 1 btc and one channel from Bob to Alice for 1 btc. In this case, there are immediately two Refund nLockTime transactions Alice's back to herself signed by Bob, and Bob's back to himself signed by Alice.  

&gt; To move the channel forward to a new balance, there's a flow in which two ""breach remedy"" transactions are created, one for each side. Then both sides of the channel sign the actual state update changing the balance.  

This is incorrect. Depending on which way the funds are to flow, only one leg will need to be used. Only one new Refund nLockTime transaction will need to be signed with a shorter nLockTime than the original. Also, both sides do not sign, and transactions are not sent to the block chain unless one of the sides wishes to unilaterally close the channel.  

&gt; I think the key part here is that these guys are signing transactions against values that aren't present yet. They sign a refund transaction against funds that aren't deposited yet. They sign a breach transaction against a missing value that isn't known yet. Those transactions then act as a forward guarantee for future action  

I'm not exactly clear what you mean here, but every established  LN channel always starts fully funded.",2016-07-23 08:16:53+00:00,d5nfx3r,14.0,t1_d5nfll4,1160.0,btc

982,"&gt; It could be a problem for one sided LN channels, what you say is an issue for normal payment channels  

I think there really is only one kind of LN channel. Everything else would be a combo. Like in your example one from Alice to Bob, and one back.  

&gt; Another option to deal with that for normal channels is to make the timeouts super long. So far I've seen in my study of the Blockchain market that there is a long tail of fees: theres a big gap between ""next block"" fee and ""this week"" fee. This is kind of the unknown part though: will there be an arrangement of variables that everyone is happy about?  

If you're saying what I think you are, I agree this is a problem. It also drastically increase what Poon calls ""time risk of money"" in the video. If you set a long ""timeout"" then have a breach early on, you've got to wait forever until the nLockTime on your refund transaction expires.",2016-07-23 07:56:14+00:00,d5nfksm,14.0,t1_d5nf7re,1224.0,btc
983,"&gt; Alice's LN balance is different than the blockchain balance.  

I believe we're talking pure LN here until after the breach, right? So there is no ""blockchain balance"" to compare with.  

OK, I think I see where we're diverging.  

Everything I've said so far is based on that video I linked to you. It starts with a unidirectional channel opened by Alice to Bob. Poon refers to such a channel as ""full"", meaning it can only be used in one direction so far, so it's not all that useful. After Alice sends some funds to Bob on this channel, it can subsequently be used bi-directionally.

All that subsequent presentation builds upon this initial channel example.  

Now, you're talking about a situation where both Alice and Bob fund a multisig address at the beginning. I've not seen any direct work from Poon and Dryja on this, but I assume this can be a simple superposition of a channel from Alice to Bob for 1 btc, and a channel from Bob to Alice for 1 btc. You may be able to optimize some of the transactions and such with such a superposition, I don't know, but the refund payments for each of the legs of the two channels would be the same as the example in the video I linked. There is no mechanism to pay out more than either side paid into their side of the channel as a breach refund.  

&gt; When changing states, Bob and Alice form a breach remedy transaction that they hand off to each other to use in case of breach.  

Yes and this breach remedy (or refund nLockTime) transaction is never for more than each opened their channel for. So 1 btc to Alice for her leg, and 1 btc to Bob for his leg. Neither leg can ever return more than that 1 btc.  

&gt; Alice now broadcasts the pre-formed penalty transaction and that takes Bob's share...

This can never happen because Bob has never signed a transaction giving his share to Alice. It's not part of the LN protocol.

This is also why it's easier to look at it from the example that Poon and Dryja use in their video. Less confusion when you deal with a single channel rather than a superposition of two.

1004,"First of all, if I have any of the details of LN wrong, I apologize. But however LN *does actually work*, LN on Bitcoin is still disadvantaged by higher transaction fees. LN would work the same way on any altcoin with vastly lower transaction fees, conferring more use cases and higher trustlessness to LN in those situations.  

Now, on LN details, perhaps we're differing on how funds get back on chain after that third transaction is sent to recover from a contract breach. My understanding is that funds are locked in the LN channel for the duration the user establishes when they first open the channel. Therefore, in a contract breach situation, they stop getting the cooperation of the other party. They can broadcast their remedy transaction, but it can't cause the channel to expire any faster than the original channel duration. Do I have that part wrong?  

Lastly, I don't see how that quote you included shows the victim party gets *more* funds than they would be entitled to if there was no contract breach, unless you're talking about the balance in the channel that was uncommitted to the low-value transaction to begin with.

1030,"If the block size limit gets raised, and Bitcoin forks away from the Core repository, growth and development get unshackled. This is the best case to support my belief in Bitcoin.  

In the absolute worst case, everything becomes an ""it depends"". How long will it take to get working SegWit out, along with widespread ecosystem adoption? Will it actually work as promised and deliver some transaction growth relief? Assuming that goes OK, what's the next domineering act Core will pull against input from the Bitcoin community? Will we ever fork away from Core? If we stay with Core too long, will each self-centered move they make risk loss of more of Bitcoin's first-mover advantage? Also, if everything takes too long, or if too many problems are encountered, will Bitcoin's entire first-mover advantage have been frittered away before it can compete with the unhindered growth of all the altcoins?  

One possibility is that SegWit arrives and the ecosystem rolls out widespread adoption within the next year or so. If this is fast enough not to have not lost all of the first-mover advantage, Bitcoin might still have a chance, but it will have allowed the rabble to gain on it. Further, Blockstream/Core would still be at the helm. Emboldened by their ""SegWit while strangling the network with the 1 MB block size limit debacle,"" I can foresee them pulling more and more such self-centered stunts to the detriment of Bitcoin's original advantage. Perhaps, they'd finally pull something egregious enough to get the community to fork away from them, then again Bitcoin would have a chance, but only after having lost even more of its initial head-start.  

So in my view, Bitcoin's best chance is to throw off the Core yoke as quickly as possible. But even if that does not happen, Bitcoin might still have a chance. A chance that diminishes the longer they stay under Core, or that Core continues as it has without reverting to truly open Bitcoin-style community behavior.  

Essentially, Bitcoin was always intended to be decentralized in all things. Continuing under Core means that development remains entirely centralized. In my view, that must eventually kill what was originally intended to be a radically decentralized project.",2016-07-22 10:45:49+00:00,d5m6h9a,1.0,t3_4u1pzy,9951.0,btc
1031,"OK, first a couple of caveats: 1) I didn't think up this attack, I just read about it, so don't take any of this as absolute gospel, 2) This is just one way to exploit it that I thought of; there are likely many other more clever ways to take advantage of this. To begin, I have to assume you did not use the fix I proposed in my original post.  

Let's say you've got some ETH in an address before the fork. After the fork, now you've got the same amount in both ETHF and ETHC at the same address but on different chains. The value of the amounts in USD is now different, even though the numerical amount of ETHx is the same. To make things simple, let's say the amount in ETHC is worth $200, and the amount in ETHF is worth $40,000 ($200 x 200, roughly the difference in network security/total hashrate between the two chains right now). So you decide you want to move the ETHC to an exchange to sell. You send the $200 worth of ETHC to the address provided by the exchange, but there's a crook working for this exchange. He sees the transaction and keeps a copy of the raw transaction for himself. Meanwhile, the send goes through and the exchange now has $200 worth of ETHC credited to your account and you're happy. Next, the crook checks the same send address for ETHF and sees the $40,000 worth sitting there. No one at this exchange is expecting a transaction at the ETHF receive address, since your official transaction was just for ETHC. The crook broadcasts the same transaction to the ETHF network and sends your $40,000 worth of ETHF to the same receive address on the ETHF chain. But the exchange is not looking for funds there, so as soon as it's received, the thief sends it to an address of his, quits his job, and goes on a very nice vacation on your dime.  

e: In direct answer to one of your questions, it's called a ""replay attack"" because you ""replay"" the same valid transaction on the other chain.

My understanding is you can mine with any full node client, so if you set up your mining with a client that has XThin Blocks integrated (for instance, for a P2Pool instance or for solo mining), I would've of thought the benefit would extend to mining as well.  

Let's say you're right about this. Do you know what the motivation is for non-mining nodes to want this much optimization of block propagation? I can't think of a reason.

1099,"&gt; This post is about Bitcoin.

Not according to its title. Most other submissions like this get deleted.  

&gt; Hardforks are very difficult because of the way full nodes work, as I mentioned.  

Non-mining nodes do not make a hard fork any more or less difficult. They simply continue to operate on their own chain. Post-fork, another chain may be available, but the node client would need to change to operate on that new chain.  

&gt; The idea that Satoshi intended miners to be rulers of the network is clearly contradicted by the following paragraph from the SPV section of the paper (and in many places elsewhere):  

I've never subscribed to the contention that miners are ""rulers"" of the Bitcoin network, but any fork must be initiated by at least some miners.  

&gt; Satoshi's design for Bitcoin was that most people (certainly most merchants) would run full nodes, and full nodes would enforce the rules no matter what, regardless of miner support.  

I dispute that Satoshi intended anything of the sort, or community adoption of hard forks would be impossible. Nodes can choose to run code with any rules they like, but at least some miners would need to be supplying complying new blocks for them for the network to be functional.  

&gt; ... he clearly intended Bitcoin to be tamper-resistant....

That Bitcoin is already tamper-resistant does not mean that anything need be done to make hard forks *artificially* harder than they already are.  

What's hard is for a post-fork chain to establish market dominance. That's the mechanism that determines relevance in Satoshi's system.

1120,"&gt; Hence... unless XThin/Compact Blocks can best the Relay Network, their block propagation latency improvements really only apply to the non-mining nodes (and p2pool miners?), since the mining network will be using Relay Network, and then FIBRE or Falcon or whatever once finished.

I see your point, but it makes one wonder then why all the work from both Unlimited and Core on their versions of this. If Falcon and FIBRE truly turn out to be superior, I'd bet large mining concerns go with those (though I shouldn't forget that Falcon and FIBRE arrived after XThin and Compact Blocks).  

Perhaps the idea was to minimize the advantage large mining concerns have in an attempt to level the playing field for any small scale miners (like P2Pool, as you mentioned). Still strikes me as a bit of an odd priority, though, all things considered. In order to incentivize small scale mining, XThin and/or Compact Blocks would've needed to be at least as good as their centralized alternatives. And in the best case with equally good block propagation, small miners still can't matched the subsidized power or direct access to chip foundries of the large Chinese mining concerns.  

&gt; I'm not familiar with any significant miners running Bitcoin Unlimited/Xthin.  

Significant? Relative to the Chinese miners, perhaps not. But at least substantial enough to generate good data. I'd bet the Toomin brothers concern was involved.  

The Chinese apparently are wedded to Core incumbency, at least for now. That's why I suggested XThin benefits would've only been widely available had Core chosen to adopt it. But it would've been available months ago, and then Compact Block developers could've lent a hand elsewhere.  

&gt; I'm not certain here, but I think all the comparisons I've seen have been of non-mining nodes?  

Perhaps so. I think this is probably because for the decentralized propagation systems to work well globally, even non-mining nodes may need to support them, even if the end benefit is only realized by miners themselves.",2016-07-21 08:32:49+00:00,d5kqbxh,8.0,t1_d5ka2qp,31394.0,btc

1123,"My main point was simply that the Road Map indicated SegWit would be first, then other optimization work (which apparently included what became Compact Blocks) would follow, but that it seems those plans changed around the time data became available showing XThin Blocks' delivers reductions in propagation times. In response, Core devs apparently changed their priorities and work loads so that Compact Blocks got released first (work that mostly duplicates what XThin Blocks already achieved). If they had instead simply adopted XThin Blocks and retained their original work priorities, Core users would have already enjoyed improved block propagation for some time now, and Core devs might've come closer to meeting their April SegWit deadline. They could always have gone back to working on Compact Blocks later if it really will deliver significant improvement over XThin Blocks, but if improvement would only be of a marginal variety, perhaps such work should be made a low priority. Instead, it appears they indulged in petty one-upmanship against the Bitcoin Unlimited team, and rushed to finish Compact Blocks simply as a point of pride.  

As far as use-cases, my understanding of the Relay Network, XThin/Compact Blocks and the more recent Falcon and FIBRE offerings is somewhat different, but I haven't been deeply invested in any of the forgoing, so I can't claim for certain that my understanding is any more correct than yours. I'm under the impression that all of the above are primarily designed to minimize block propagation times and so are primarily useful to large mining concerns. As far as performance, I believe you're right that the original Relay Network's performance is believed to be better than either XThin Blocks or Compact Blocks, but XThin Blocks has demonstrated that it approximates Relay Network's performance fairly closely. The primary difference between the Relay Network and XThin/Compact Blocks is that the latter are decentralized implementations included in node client code, as opposed to being a separate and centralized design with the Relay Network. I believe Falcon and FIBRE are both also centralized, but are newer designs that further optimize performance over the Relay Network. If I'm wrong on any of this, I hope someone will provide definitive corrections.  

&gt; Late, obviously. Looks to be pretty much finished and just awaiting inclusion in a release from what I can see.  

I appreciate your admitting that. Many others have quibbled about what was supposedly intended by the word ""released"" instead.  

Personally, I find it's pretty typical that complex new code isn't ready at original, optimistic delivery dates. Core is probably no different from most other developers in this respect. But by using their overly optimistic delivery schedules as justification not to raise the block size limit first, they've essentially created this high pressure atmosphere to deliver SegWit ASAP, while also progressively costing Bitcoin its first-mover advantage as delays continue. A modest raise of the limit to 2 MB would give Core plenty of leeway to ensure their new, significantly altered architecture is fully bug free. It would also allow gradual ecosystem roll out of needed upgrades to take advantage of SegWit and pave the way for LN deployment. As it is, true block saturation is rapidly approaching, and ecosystem roll out of SegWit compatible wallets/exchanges/etc. has yet to really even begin.  

And if any setbacks occur from here on out, or if SegWit or LN fail to live up to their initial claims in some way, the situation Core has created for Bitcoin becomes that much worse.",2016-07-20 22:13:29+00:00,d5k63id,6.0,t1_d5k15sq,6498.0,btc

1150,"The problem is this is Blockstream's (and more specifically Greg Maxwell's) modus operandi. They make the move that *looks* user friendly, and they couch it in as community friendly language as possible. But look at their actions: they have stone-walled the community desire to raise the 1 MB block size limit (not even discussing specifics such as how much decentralization Bitcoin needs and how it should be measured) and they refused to stand up against obvious censorship in major Bitcoin forums in a timely fashion. Oddly enough, Adam Back, Blockstream's President and Co-Founder himself proposed a 2 - 4 - 8 MB block size increase which no one in Blockstream will even discuss anymore.  

Although some may have suspicions about such behavior, I suppose it could be ascribed to apathy, indifference, or laziness. That is until you examine the one situation that they have been driving and are arguably in direct control over: SegWit. Why enforce the default condition to discount SegWit data over ordinary Bitcoin transaction data? It's directly to manipulate market conditions to force users to use SegWit, instead of allowing the market to evaluate the alternatives on a level playing field. This is the same playbook they apply in their actively fighting any raise of the block size limit, thereby artificially restricting conventional Bitcoin to the detriment of the Bitcoin community overall while benefiting Blockstream's agenda and solutions. They then sit by (or possibly support behind the scenes) active censorship that abets their behavior.  

I have voiced my reservations about this patents issue specifically in a comment I linked below, if you are interested. I suppose the TL;DR of it would be that this seems to be in-effect VC money buying up control over Bitcoin innovation via a private, for-profit startup--a contentious organization among the Bitcoin community that has no track record of doing the principled or self-sacrificing thing with respect to Bitcoin as a whole:

1151,"&gt; The benefit is increased confirmation reliability.  

Only a concern due to artificially restricted block space, to which RBF is a kludgey response at best.  

&gt; Only if they accept 0-conf payments (which is not particularly common anymore)  

Definitely in the zero-conf case, something that is being specifically killed by both RBF and the restriction not to permit Bitcoin to grow as designed. But also in situations where confirmations occur. Since a non-RBF transaction can be more trusted after any specific number of confirmations than can an RBF transaction. For instance, if a merchant's system is efficient and begins the packaging and shipping process as soon as possible, it may look for just an initial confirmation. If that block orphans for whatever reason, the non-RBF transaction would be far safer, whereas the RBF transaction gets another chance to be double-spent.  

&gt; This isn't any different than having to handle transactions that say for instance didn't include a fee at all.  

The difference is the no fee situation in zero-conf is likely rather rare, and in the alternative (waiting for confirmations) likely also unusual. However, getting sent an unwanted RBF transaction is now facillitated by design -- a concern that did not even exist previously, and it's an issue that will be made more serious if and when more wallets start incorporating the functionality.",2016-07-20 08:48:22+00:00,d5jc82r,15.0,t1_d5jbeb3,2784.0,btc
1152,"&gt; ECONOMY  CENTRAL BANKS RESEARCH  
&gt; 
&gt; The Central Bankers’ Bold New Idea: Print Bitcoins  
&gt; 
&gt; Bank of England economists advocate central banks issue their own digital currency  
&gt; 
&gt; By JON SINDREU  
&gt; Updated July 19, 2016 1:56 p.m. ET  
&gt; 12 COMMENTS  
&gt; 
&gt; When it comes to bitcoin and digital currencies, central banks might be considering the adage: “If you can’t beat them, join them.”  
&gt; 
&gt; In a research paper published on Monday, economists at the Bank of England advocated that central banks issue their own kind of digital currency. Using the U.S. as a case study, they argued it could give a permanent boost to the economy of around 3%, as well as providing policy makers with more effective tools to tame financial booms and busts.  
&gt; 
&gt; BOE economists John Barrdear and Michael Kumhof write that “reductions in real interest rates, distortionary taxes, and monetary transaction costs” would boost the economy.  
&gt; 
&gt; Much like physical cash, digital currencies like bitcoin allow direct payment from one person to another, but they also have all the advantages of bank transfers, because large payments can be made instantaneously across the globe.  
&gt; 
&gt; But the main appeal of bitcoin isn’t that it’s electronic. In fact, most money already is: Only about 5% of money in the economy is physical cash; the rest is bank deposits.  
&gt; 
&gt; Rather, a digital currency offers a decentralized way to make payments without needing commercial banks to stand in the middle and record the transaction. Payments are validated by other users in a global network of computers and then updated in a shared record known as the blockchain.  
&gt; 
&gt; ‘I don’t see how banks could compete’  
&gt; —Peter Stella, former central-banking head of the International Monetary Fund and director of Stellar Consulting LLC  
&gt; 
&gt; Central banks across the developed world, including the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, are now studying the potential of this technology. Were central banks to issue digital cash and make it available to the general public, money would exist electronically outside of bank accounts in digital wallets, much as physical bank notes do. This means households and businesses would be able to bypass banks altogether when making payments to one another.  
&gt; 
&gt; This could trigger a radical reshaping of the financial system.  
&gt; 
&gt; “Making central bank money widely available could have an impact on deposits held at commercial banks and a knock-on effect on the banking system,” the BOE said in a research paper last year, because the new digital money would be seen as a cheaper and safer alternative.  
&gt; 
&gt; “I don’t see how banks could compete,” said Peter Stella, former central-banking head of the International Monetary Fund and director of Stellar Consulting LLC.  
&gt; 
&gt; Many economists would cheer at the prospect of all the money in the economy being issued by the central bank, instead of existing as current accounts or deposits, which are the liabilities of private banks. One of the authors of the BOE digital-currency paper, Mr. Kumhof, in 2012 co-wrote research for the IMF making the case for so-called full-reserve banking. He argued it could boost the U.S. economy by around 10%.  
&gt; 
&gt; Key figures in American economics, such as Irving Fisher and Milton Friedman, have also advocated full-reserve banking. Under such a system, banks are forced to back every single deposit they issue to their customers with money at the central bank, essentially turning the central bank into the sole creator of money.  
&gt; 
&gt; This isn’t how the monetary system works at the moment. As long as deposits at private banks can act as money, banks have the power to create an infinite amount of money out of thin air: When they grant a loan, banks just use their computers to increase the customer’s account balance.  
&gt; 
&gt; It’s only when one bank needs to make payments to another that it requires actual central-bank issued cash, called reserves. Banks can always get more reserves at the central bank, for a price.  
&gt; 
&gt; While this price—the interest rate—can influence how much money private banks create, many economists have long argued this control is too weak, giving birth to financial bubbles.  
&gt; 
&gt; Proposals to outlaw private-bank money have seen a revival since the financial meltdown in 2008. Iceland is spearheading the charge and studying how to create an alternative system, where all money is created by the central bank.  
&gt; 
&gt; A central-bank-issued bitcoin would be a means for policy makers to completely control the amount of money in the economy, much like full-reserve banking. That’s not possible right now, because private banks can create money on their own.  
&gt; 
&gt; For many economists, however, the focus on the quantity of money and who creates it is a mistake. They argue it’s the amount of credit and how it’s used that matters, which means over-optimistic expectations about the future will still bring about a financial bubble.  
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s the private sector which decides whether actually to accept those terms and conditions and ask the banks to give them the loan,” said Charles Goodhart, a professor at the London School of Economics and former Bank of England rate-setter.  
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, the debate dates back to the spat between the Currency School and the Banking School in 19th-century Britain. While the Currency School saw excessive issuance of notes by private banks as the reason for excessive inflation, the Banking School thought the amount of money in circulation was a result of what happened in the economy, instead of a cause.  
&gt; 
&gt; The idea that controlling the amount of money in the economy will determine economic growth, inflation or credit creation has long appeared false. Since central banks started bond-buying programs in 2008, for example, the amount of central-bank money has exploded, but no inflation has materialized. Experiments to control the quantity of money in the 1980s, inspired by Milton Friedman, also ended in failure, with central banks fully reverting to using interest-rate policy by the 1990s.  
&gt; 
&gt; Proposals to create a bitcoin-like central bank currency also risk alienating another set of activists: The actual supporters of bitcoin. The whole point of a digital currency, they say, is that it’s money without government.  
&gt; 
&gt; “The key benefit is decentralization,” said Marco Streng, chief executive at Genesis Mining, a digital-currency company. “The best scenario is where people would not necessarily need to trust the government, they would just need to trust the blockchain.”

1153,"Perhaps, but there is no benefit either. And now there is the added requirement to code and/or manually watch out and select or deselect RBF payments. In fact, if a merchant chooses *not* to support RBF, they must now institute a potential refund policy if someone tries to send them an RBF payment they don't wish to tangle with (i.e. ensure that the sender doesn't double-spend to another address after it has already entered the merchant's accounting process), which does eventually confirm. So not only did it break something that formerly worked fine to begin with (assuming the receiver elected to accept any zero-conf risk), it's now added an additional headache for those who may have never wanted RBF in the first place.",2016-07-20 06:11:00+00:00,d5j92d2,13.0,t1_d5j7h3n,3641.0,btc
1154,"&gt; ... patents are actually rather inexpensive to obtain....  

You may need to qualify the term ""inexpensive"" here, as I suspect it may mean something different when you are operating with approximately $76 million of VC bankroll. If you include billed legal hours, and perhaps PR efforts such as this, I suspect the cost is less than trivial.  

&gt; ... which come from revenue, prior investments, etc....  

You'll have to correct me if I'm wrong here, but Blockstream has no publicly disclosed product or service, no publicly disclosed income or revenue stream, and no publicly disclosed business plan, yet we are to take on faith that a massively VC-funded start-up is footing the administrative and legal costs of patenting Bitcoin community intellectual property *without private funds*? Perhaps you can provide some transparency here to allay community concerns.  

As far as I can see, any claimed benefits from this move to the Bitcoin community will hinge first on trust in good behavior by Blockstream, then secondly on the vicissitudes of the civil legal system should promises be broken. I can see where Blockstream will get its funding for it's legal litigation, but somehow I think the average Bitcoin community member may have a harder time acquiring and funding a similarly formidable legal presence.  

For the sake of argument, let's say these patents are granted to Blockstream. Let's then say that the value of these patents begin to appreciate over time. What guarantee is there to the community that any profitable return from use of the patents as equity or collateral for further loans or investment is duly returned to the Bitcoin community at large?  

Further, let's anticipate a time when, whether intentional or not, the patents come on the market and are then sold. What ensures that any appreciation in the value of the patents gets returned to the community (less Blockstream's initial costs to establish the patent(s))?  

If Blockstream had operated from day one as an open, welcoming, forthright, inclusive, and demonstrably trustworthy steward for the Bitcoin community, it might be possible to defend the inappropriateness of a central, for-profit company patenting the open-source community innovation of a radically decentralized project. Should they have done this, they may have earned some trust from the community, even though one of Bitcoin's precepts is to operate trustlessly. However, Blockstream has always been opaque, deaf to the community as a whole, obstructionist, tacitly censorship-supporting, and indifferent to the colossal appearance of conflict of interest it casts over Bitcoin development and governance. The chilling effects you speak of seem to pale in comparison to the chilling effect *this announced move* will have on Bitcoin as a whole.

Not quite, it ignores the fact that what you get paid with in LN is bitcoins tied up in LN. Funds locked in LN channels are *not* on-chain bitcoin.

You can settle subject to the cooperation of the other side of the channel, what miners fees happen to be at the time, and assuming fees don't surge after you've submitted your transactions.

1238,"&gt; Bitcoin ‘Miners’ Get Set for Another Pay Cut  
&gt; By PAUL VIGNA  
&gt; Updated July 8, 2016 8:29 p.m. ET  
&gt; 0 COMMENTS  

&gt; Investors mark their calendars with everything from earnings releases to monthly job reports.
&gt; 
&gt; For followers of the virtual currency bitcoin, the big event is actually this weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; On Saturday, shortly after noon Eastern time, something will happen that’s happened only one other time in the more-than seven years Bitcoin has existed.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s called the “halving,” a preprogrammed feature in bitcoin’s internal plumbing that literally cuts in half the monetary reward network operators receive for processing transactions and creating new bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; The event represents a major if well-anticipated change in how bitcoins are created and how the decentralized network that trades them is maintained. In recent months, a run-up in the price of bitcoin was attributed in part to the halving since it will effectively cut by 50% the rate of production of new bitcoins.
&gt; 
&gt; For the people who make a living off maintaining bitcoin’s global network, the so-called miners, it will have very real effects. One miner, Sweden’s KnCMiner, already filed for bankruptcy protection. The good news for miners, though, is that the rising price of bitcoin in the past few months may compensate for the worst potential hazards of the halving.
&gt; 
&gt; “We are not concerned about block-reward halving,” said Valery Vavilov, the founder and CEO of mining company BitFury. He expects a short-term but “insignificant” disruption in the mining process.
&gt; 
&gt; Mining companies know that bitcoin is a volatile asset, and expect the price to fluctuate, said Jihan Wu, the co-founder and CEO of China’s Bitmain, which runs one of the largest mining pools, Antpool. “We remain unperturbed by the speculations around this issue,” he said via email.
&gt; 
&gt; So, what is the halving? It is part of the intricate system of checks and balances built into bitcoin that make it a self-operating system and prevent too many coins from being created too quickly. Specifically, it involves a monetary reward paid out to the people and groups that contribute computing power to help run the system.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin was designed to run without middlemen or centralized oversight. Rather than a network controlled by any one group on centralized servers, it operates across a global web of computers. To entice volunteers to “donate” computing power, a reward was devised: For every batch of confirmed transactions, the user would get a reward of newly created bitcoins. Because the process vaguely resembles physical mining, these users were nicknamed miners.
&gt; 
&gt; To incentivize these miners, the process was made competitive. To successfully “mine” a block of transactions, one’s computer must solve a randomly generated mathematical puzzle. But the more miners that are racing against each other to solve the puzzle, the higher the degree of difficulty. This last feature ensures that a new block of transactions will be confirmed roughly every 10 minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; Why every 10 minutes? Bitcoin was designed with a cap on the number of coins that could be created: 21 million (the coins themselves can be almost endlessly divided, down to the eighth decimal place, or into hundred millionths). This was a philosophical choice: Satoshi Nakamoto, the currency’s pseudonymous creator, set it up as an alternative to inherently inflationary national currencies.
&gt; 
&gt; To ensure that all 21 million coins would be mined over a long period of time, Nakamoto built in several features to space it out. One is the 10-minute interval between confirmed blocks. Another was to cut in half, every four years, the mining reward.
&gt; 
&gt; When bitcoin was launched in January 2009, the reward for mining was 50 coins. In 2012, that was cut in half, to 25. On Saturday, it will be cut in half again, to 12.5. In four years, it will be cut again, to 6.25, and so on, every four years, until every last bitcoin has been mined.
&gt; 
&gt; If Nakamoto’s system remains unaltered, the last bitcoin is expected to be mined some time around 2140.",2016-07-09 08:09:38+00:00,d55cg08,1.0,t3_4rzfwq,262.0,btc

1254,"&gt; Rome has criticized the EU’s new banking regime and doesn’t want to use “bail-in” rules that prescribe the order in which stakeholders must bear losses for winding down an ailing bank, in part because of the peculiarities of the Italian banking system. About €187 billion of bank bonds are in the hands of retail investors, whose holdings would be wiped out by a bank resolution under the new rules.  
&gt; 
&gt; Last year, more than 100,000 investors in four small Italian banks that were wound up saw their investments wiped out. Some lost their life savings. The controversy exploded in December after Italian news media reported that a retiree committed suicide after losing €110,000 in savings invested in one of the banks.  
&gt; 
&gt; Such problems carry little truck in Brussels. “Every grandmother has bought bank shares,” said one EU official. “That’s how it’s presented to us…. This work has to be done within the rules, using all the flexibility there is.”  
&gt; 
&gt; Weaker support  
&gt; Brussels provided a weaker form of support for the Italian banks last week when it authorized Italy to use up to €150 billion in government guarantees to offer liquidity support. Since the Italian banks haven’t suffered a lack of liquidity, that provision doesn’t help much, say analysts and bankers.  
&gt; 
&gt; The coming months promise to be tumultuous for Italian banks. The European Banking Authority will conduct stress tests of banks by the end of July and could single out some as having insufficient capital buffers.  
&gt; 
&gt; In August, an ECB task force looking at bad loans will publish draft guidance on how banks should deal with the problem. While the guidelines will be nonbinding, the supervisors could raise pressure on banks that don’t follow them.  
&gt; 
&gt; In a recent note to investors, Mr. Codogno, the former director general at the Italian Treasury, wrote: “The situation may get much worse before it gets better.”

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; MILAN—Britain’s vote to leave the EU has produced dire predictions for the U.K. economy. The damage to the rest of Europe could be more immediate and potentially more serious. Nowhere is the risk concentrated more heavily than in the Italian banking sector.  
&gt; 
&gt; In Italy, 17% of banks’ loans are sour. That is nearly 10 times the level in the U.S., where, even at the worst of the 2008-09 financial crisis, it was only 5%. Among publicly traded banks in the eurozone, Italian lenders account for nearly half of total bad loans.  
&gt; 
&gt; Years of lax lending standards left Italian banks ill-prepared when an economic slump sent bankruptcies soaring a few years ago. At one major bank, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, bad loans were so thick it assigned a team of 700 to deal with them and created a new unit to house them. Several weeks ago, the bank put the bad-credit unit up for sale, hoping a foreign partner would speed the liquidation process.  
&gt; 
&gt; The U.K. vote to exit the European Union has compounded the strains on Europe’s banks in general and Italy’s in particular. It imperils the Monte dei Paschi sale, some bankers say, and creates fresh uncertainty at a time when lenders are struggling with ultralow and even negative interest rates and sluggish economic growth.  
&gt; 
&gt; Brexit has many executives concerned that central banks will keep interest rates lower for longer than they might otherwise, in an attempt to counteract the slower growth—in the eurozone as well as Britain. European banks’ stocks slid after the vote, with those in Italy especially hurt. Shares in Monte dei Paschi are down roughly a third since the June 23 referendum.  
&gt; 
&gt; All this threatens to spark a crisis of confidence in Italian banks, analysts say. Although Italy has only one bank classified as globally significant under international banking regulations—UniCredit—some analysts say bank stresses worsened by Brexit could threaten Italy’s stability and, potentially, even that of the EU.  
&gt; 
&gt; “Brexit could lead to a full-blown banking crisis in Italy,” said  Lorenzo Codogno, former director general at the Italian Treasury. “The risk of a eurozone meltdown is clearly there if Brexit concerns are not immediately addressed.”  
&gt; 
&gt; Europe’s banks were already retrenching before the U.K. vote, and markets appear fearful many don’t have thick enough capital buffers. Even before the vote, shares were valued at levels that signaled distress. Since June 23, an index of European banks has dropped 17%, bringing total losses from the beginning of the year to 30%.  
&gt; 
&gt; The pain is greater in Europe’s periphery. Portugal’s banking system continues to struggle with souring loans, low profitability and little investor appetite. The country received an international bailout in 2011, but given Portugal’s high debt, authorities held off on a cleanup of banks’ balance sheets through the creation of a systemwide “bad bank.” That idea is being discussed now.  
&gt; 
&gt; In June, Spain’s Banco Popular Español SA raised €2.5 billion to tackle continued losses on soured property loans, a sign the country’s weakest lenders have struggled to recover from Spain’s 2008 real-estate bust and subsequent economic downturn.  
&gt; 
&gt; The profitability of Italian banks has long been among the worst in Europe, weighed down by bloated staffs and too many branches, leaving the banks with little extra capital to cover loans that go bad. Today’s low interest rates have hit Italian banks especially hard because of their heavy focus on plain-vanilla lending activities, with relatively little in fee-generating activities such as asset management and investment banking.  
&gt; 
&gt; Test of bank rules  
&gt; When the financial crisis of late 2008 hit, Italian banks tended to roll over loans whose borrowers weren’t repaying on time, hoping an economic upswing would take care of the problem, say Italian bank executives.  
&gt; 
&gt; Italian banks’ struggles have led to the first serious test of a model the EU adopted two years ago for handling banking woes. The Italian government has sought EU permission to inject €40 billion into its banks to stabilize the system.  
&gt; 
&gt; To do so would require bending an anti-bailout rule the bloc adopted in 2014 to force troubled banks’ stakeholders—shareholders, bondholders and some of their depositors as well—to pay a financial price before the country’s taxpayers must.  
&gt; 
&gt; Rome argues that bending this rule would be a small price to pay for erecting a firewall against possible bank contagion stemming from Brexit. Italy’s EU partners, led by Germany, reject the idea, leaving Rome exposed to the potential for a banking crisis.  
&gt; 
&gt; When the European Central Bank began supervising the eurozone’s largest banks in 2014, things got harder. The new supervisor applied tougher criteria than the Bank of Italy did for declaring loans impaired, say bankers. In April, it forced one bank to take bigger write-downs to bad loans before receiving its blessing to merge with another bank.  
&gt; 
&gt; The result is that impaired loans at Italian banks now exceed €360 billion—quadruple the 2008 level—and they continue to rise.  
&gt; 
&gt; Banks’ attempts to unload some of the bad loans have largely flopped, with the banks and potential investors far apart on valuations. Banks have written down nonperforming loans to about 44% of their face value, but investors believe the true value is closer to 20% or 25%—implying an additional €40 billion in write-downs.  
&gt; 
&gt; One reason for the low valuations is the enormous difficulty in unwinding a bad loan in Italy. Italy’s sclerotic courts take eight years, on average, to clear insolvency procedures. A quarter of cases take 12 years.  
&gt; 
&gt; Moreover, in many cases, the loan collateral is the family home of the owner of the business, or it is tied up in the business itself.  
&gt; 
&gt; “There is a desperate need to make collateral liquid,” said Andrea Mignanelli, chief executive of Cerved Credit Management Group. “Right now, it gets stuck in auctions and judicial procedures that make cashing the loan very hard.”  
&gt; 
&gt; The Italian government has put forth a series of solutions since last fall, but with little success so far. The proposals include incentives to encourage the creation of a nonperforming-loan market, shorter bankruptcy procedures and new rules to push Italy’s 400-odd cooperative banks to merge.  
&gt; 
&gt; Brexit has greatly compounded these problems. A slowdown in growth could cause more bad loans to pile up, further depress bank profits and erode already-thin capital cushions. Growth was already slowing before the referendum; on Friday, Italy’s business lobby group Confindustria slashed Italy’s growth forecast for this year to 0.8% from 1.4%—and to 0.6% from 1.3% for next year—as a result of the Brexit vote.  
&gt; 
&gt; Another concern is that more pressure on banks’ share prices could lead some depositors to pull out their funds. Earlier this year, Banca Monte dei Paschi saw deposit outflows after its share price fell more than a fourth in a few days.  
&gt; 
&gt; The worse their loans are performing, the more capital banks have to have as a cushion against losses. Now, “Brexit will inevitably push the banks to strengthen their capital situation in order to cope with the volatility of the markets and prevent further damage to their stock prices,” said Riccardo Serrini, chief executive of Prelios Credit Servicing, a debt collector.  
&gt; 
&gt; Strengthening capital is a tall order in post-Brexit markets. UniCredit SpA is a case in point.  
&gt; 
&gt; The bank—Italy’s largest by assets—has already undertaken €74 billion in loan write-downs and capital increases since 2008. With falling profitability and €80 billion in nonperforming loans, its capital cushion barely meets ECB requirements.  
&gt; 
&gt; With investors pummeling its shares this year, UniCredit ousted its chief executive, Federico Ghizzoni. Last week, with its stock falling, it rushed to appoint a new CEO, Jean-Pierre Mustier, its former head of corporate and investment banking. In short order, Mr. Mustier must now present a convincing restructuring plan and raise as much as €9 billion to shore up investor confidence. UniCredit declined to comment.  
&gt; 
&gt; The Italian government pushed for a broad solution that would recapitalize banks and draw a line under the bad-loans crisis, when it appealed to the EU for permission to inject €40 billion into the lenders. The Italian government argues that without such a recapitalization move, Italy’s banking problems could mushroom into a broader crisis.  
&gt; 
&gt; “There is an epidemic, and Italy is the patient that is sickest,” said Pierpaolo Baretta, an undersecretary at the Italian Economy Ministry. If “we don’t stop the epidemic, it will become everybody’s problem…The shock of Brexit has created a sense of urgency.”  
&gt; 
&gt; Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi pressed the issue in his meeting last week with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  
&gt; 
&gt; The European Commission, with strong backing from Berlin, has dismissed the push from the Italians. Some European officials privately expressed annoyance that Rome has been slow to deal with its banking problem and is paying the price in such volatile markets. Now, they say, the Italians are using Brexit to press for permission to bend the rules of a hard-fought banking regime.  
&gt; 
&gt; “We worked to set down certain rules about bank resolution and bank recapitalization,” Ms. Merkel said last week in Brussels. “We can’t do everything again every two years. We put a lot of effort into that.”  
&gt; 
&gt; Instead, EU officials say bank supervisors might need to declare some lenders insolvent and impose losses on investors first.

1258,"&gt; I agree with his position that we need to prioritize decentralization over bigger blocks, and that we should do it in a well thought out way, backed by hard evidence.

This is the type of imprecise and indirect answer that is prone to come from both Blockstream and Core. Do you support luke-jr's position to *reduce the current block size limit*. It's a simple yes or no question.  

What does ""prioritize"" even mean? You want *more* decentralization in the system than there is now? Because as I explained before, the current level can be maintained *as the block size limit is increased*. Please explain in your thinking, how much decentralization would be too much and how much would be too little. We could always maximize decentralization via block size by reducing the limit as much as possible. But somehow that doesn't result in a very useful system.  

&gt; It wasn't optimal yesterday. Did you even read what he wrote?  

Nothing you wrote established this as fact, or even discussed your technical reasoning in specific.

Bitcoin is not some idealized perfection, it has always been a ""good enough"" solution of the Byzantine General's problem. Attempting to hold any one characteristic of the system as sacrosanct strangles the overall network. It is the greater Bitcoin community, through market actions that should determine how it evolves. It should absolutely not be up to some subset of the community to impose what *it thinks should be a particular* limit, but the community as a whole that decides.

I'm looking more for technical discussion why the 1 MB block size limit is somehow optimal.

Or perhaps the correct figure isn't even 1 MB to begin with, since when it was implemented in around July 2010, it was over 100x larger than the average block size at the time. In the intervening years, this large block headroom has caused no disasters, and had no Core/Qt devs demanding to reduce it (save perhaps luke-jr).

1265,"I think the source of the disconnect between /r/Bitcoin and /r/btc is easy to pinpoint: it's that nearly everyone here was formerly a subscriber and participant in /r/Bitcoin, but was since censored and/or banned by abusive moderation dictated by /u/theymos, the top-mod of /r/Bitcoin, or came here searching for an alternative after learning about what's happening. This all occurred over the refusal of theymos and the /r/Bitcoin moderation team to allow any discussion of hard fork possibilities for raising the 1 MiB block size limit, including any mention of alternative Bitcoin clients such as Classic, XT, and Unlimited, then further slandering attempts to offer the community choice as ""altcoins"" (denigrating both altcoins and supporters of raising the block size limit at the same time). The censorship then expanded to preclude mentioning any of the censorship that was under way, as well as discussion or criticism of the mods and their actions. Even the subreddit's policies could not be openly discussed. Some of these draconian measures have lessened a bit (or maybe enforcement has just gotten a little slack), but much of it is still in place.  

* Core has at least a severe appearance of conflict of interest resulting from their ties with Blockstream, ignores significant segments of the overall Bitcoin community, is moving Bitcoin away from Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision of being a peer-to-peer cash network towards an expensive settlement network (relieving on-chain bitcoin units of much of their usefulness as transactional entities and making them primarily stores of wealth in the process), is strangling normal on-chain growth of the Bitcoin network by intentionally maintaining the 1 MB block size limit (which was always supposed to be a temporary measure to be raised when needed), eschews the Keep it Simple Stupid principle by pushing complex solutions at the expense of the continued growth of a known working system, all of which *coincidentally* bolsters the goals and potential profitability of Blockstream.  

* Blockstream is a [heavily venture capital funded for-profit company](http://www.coindesk.com/blockstream-55-million-series-a/) ostensibly [""focused on developing bitcoin applications specifically sidechains, as well as other applications,""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockstream) that happens to employ or seems to have extensive influence over the most active Core developers.  

* That ""Bitcoin will cease to function properly or become worthless after the halving"" seems to me to be an overstatement, or a position professed by relatively few. Some have expressed concerns that since the economics of mining will change dramatically at the halving, a steep drop in hash rate will result. With the current block congestion being actively maintained by the Core/Blockstream agenda, if the total hash rate were suddenly to drop by half, confirmation delays and mempool growth would be greatly exacerbated as a result of initially doubled block times. But even in the worse case, the shock of such a change would work its way through Bitcoin eventually. Also, the severity of the halving's impact is likely mitigated by several factors: the key is that this is the *second* halving. It's a known event that everyone could see coming and plan for. Much of the impact is likely already figured or priced in. Just as important, difficulty self-adjusts so that it will always be economical for someone to mine. If anything, the halving aggravating the block congestion situation only accelerates somewhat a scenario that is already on its way as long as promised solutions from Core fail to materialize or a hard fork to raise the 1 MiB block size limit does not occur. This congestion and its adverse consequences have been steadily approaching while the situation has been discussed over several years. It very well may be having a suppressive effect on Bitcoin growth both in valuation and as a network, a suppression that will increase as the congestion events get longer and more frequent. But even at its worst, Bitcoin will not cease to function or become completely worthless. On the contrary, the situation gradually worsening may finally trigger action to deal with the underlying cause.  

* You must be referring to the 1 megabyte (MB) block size limit that Bitcoin currently has. [Here's a little history of it](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability_FAQ#What_is_the_short_history_of_the_block_size_limit.3F) (although that passage seems to be accurate right now, the Bitcoin wiki is controlled by the small block contingent, so in case it changes, [this archive](http://archive.is/qvE4l)).  

* The use of censorship in the scalability debate has driven this polarizing wedge in the Bitcoin community. As a result there's definitely too much venom and vehemence on both sides. Try to look past it. At the very least this subreddit is essentially free from censorship (though some may consider its moderation still too active, myself included). I think Bitcoin and /r/btc both strive to be welcoming, inclusive communities. In fact, I bet most here would gladly re-embrace /r/Bitcoin if only /u/theymos would step down from his top-mod position instead of squatting on the best Reddit Bitcoin property and openly repudiating as much as 90%+ of its active pre-censorship participants. Bitcoin itself is open and permissionless, /r/Bitcoin should be the same.

1285,"I wouldn't be able to manage ELI5 but basically, it'll restore the organic growth Bitcoin has enjoyed over most of it's lifetime, as [this chart shows](https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-block-size?showDataPoints=false&amp;show_header=true&amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;timespan=all&amp;scale=1&amp;address=), while still allowing careful and unhurried development of new potential scaling solutions.  

Maintaining the self-imposed 1 MB limit only serves to drive those trying to use Bitcoin either to centralized solutions, or to alternative crypto-currencies that do not have the same limitations.  

I believe there are two real groups opposed to raising the block size limit, those that are purportedly true believers of their arguments, and those either working for or closely allied with Blockstream and thus having at least a strong *appearance* of conflict of interest. But the main arguments both groups profess are the same: that raising the block size limit would 1) result in sacrificing Bitcoin's essential decentralization, and/or 2) that hard forks are too dangerous/risky.  Many if not most support changing Bitcoin from its original vision as ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" into a much more restricted and expensive ""settlement layer"" with on-chain units intended more as a store of wealth than for the purposes of transaction.  

Regarding the loss of decentralization argument, I believe it ignores the fact that technology is constantly improving so that a fixed level of decentralization can be maintained while continually allowing for larger blocks as time passes. Almost none of those arguing that a possible loss of decentralization would be critical can explain why they haven't been pushing *to reduce the block size limit* for the past seven years in order to protect decentralization before. Raising the limit now to 2 MB (or 4, 8 or even 20 MB) would be massively more conservative than the original 1 MB limit that Satoshi put in place around July 2010. As you can see from the chart I linked above, at the time the 1 MB block size limit was much more than 100x larger than the average block size. Even a 20 MB limit now would proportionally be a much more restrictive measure. Instead of seeking the rate that the block size limit can be raised while preserving existing decentralization, or even examining exactly how much absolute decentralization is essential in Bitcoin relative to the system's overall usefulness, they choose to smother Bitcoin by protecting the arbitrary 1 MB restriction (one which [even Satoshi always expressed was a *temporary* measure](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3giend/citation_needed_satoshis_reason_for_blocksize/ctymd4v)).  

As far as hard forks being too dangerous, they happen across the crypto-currency ecosystem all the time without the sky falling. In fact, even Core devs admit that hard forks will be necessary in the future, when Bitcoin's community will presumably be larger and thus any risks they are concerned about now become even more pressing. An extension of the hard forks (HFs) are too dangerous argument is that permitting HFs would make Bitcoin too changeable, a further risk. I take a different view, that one of Bitcoin's most primary characteristics is its decentralized nature, which also must extend to its development and how it evolves. This aspect of Bitcoin's decentralization can not be expressed if development is restricted to a single software repository (Bitcoin Core) or if choices are not available to Bitcoin users via hard forks. Only those HFs supported by the community consensus would have any chance of success in any case. In the case of the hard fork to raise the block size limit to 2 MB via Bitcoin Classic, the terms of HF activation are very conservative: the change only triggers after 750 of the most recent 1000 mined Bitcoin blocks signals support for the measure, and thereafter the first &gt; 1 MB block can only be mined folloiwing a 28-day grace period.  

A further factor in this debate is the fact that Blockstream, a for-profit company funded by numerous VCs, directly employs or has substantial influence over the most influential Bitcoin Core developers. Those funding Blockstream will not be very patient to see a return upon their investments, and thus would clearly support any behavior increasing that likelihood. Strangling normal on-chain Bitcoin use to force traffic towards their developed alternatives would obviously support this agenda. Any sacrifice of Bitcoin's first-mover advantage as the original decentralized crypto-currency would be a distant secondary consideration. In fact, there is no way to determine how many supporters of maintaining the 1 MB limit are actually independent true believers, and how many may be paid or otherwise influenced by Blockstream's immense VC bankroll, or at least influenced by possible Blockstream-sourced propaganda.  

I support any and all attempts to develop new scaling solutions for Bitcoin, even those that might sacrifice some decentralization as long as users are free to choose whether or not to use them. However, I'm against any manipulation of Bitcoin to artificially incentivize any particular scaling solution's use, something Core's implementation of SegWit clearly does, and which Lightning Network also may benefit from, if only indirectly. All options should be selected by the community and marketplace, as freely as possible.

For more on the block size debate, I'd suggest you look at Gavin Andresen's (/u/gavinandresen) blog posts. Andresen is the long time Bitcoin developer that Satoshi essentially left in charge of the project when he disappeared. Here are some of his relevant articles:

For the opposing viewpoint, you probably know you can visit /r/Bitcoin, [Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/), [the Bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page), or nearly all of the [BitcoinTalk forums](https://bitcointalk.org/), all which are censored and controlled by the small block contingent.  

e: minor wording, added link to Satoshi post about raising the block size limit  

e2: I also forgot a major reason why both Bitcoin Core and Blockstream will fight tooth and nail against a hard fork. If a hard fork happens there is a significant chance that it will mean a fork to another primary Bitcoin client (e.g. Classic, XT, Unlimited, etc.) Should this happen, it means any capture of the Bitcoin ecosystem that Blockstream and/or Bitcoin Core currently have will be lost. Moreover, such a step could be the first on a slippery slope leading to greater and greater developmental decentralization for Bitcoin; not a good thing if you are a private company pushing a profit agenda for your VCs, nor if you are the incumbent software repository (Core).

Without question, there is a baseline level of such inquiries at all times. Also, there are definitely some inquiries about ""stuck transactions"" which seem politically motivated. Regardless, it seems clear to me that there are increasing episodes wherein these posts are occurring at higher than normal rates. These episodes also coincide with periods of heightened transaction fees, another negative for user experience. Transaction fee spikes are clearly recorded by a number of monitoring sites, so this cannot be denied.  

&gt; Interesting err.. ""theory"". Again, zero support for it in reality.
Note the illogical use of ""artificial"" above. There are damn good reasons for limiting blocksize, else it would have been increased years ago. Sounds like someone has been hanging out on /btc a bit much? Probably better to go back.
People here, actual bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, actually know what's up.  

It's hardly just theory, but common sense backed with substantial anecdotal reporting. During the surge in Bitcoin VC investment from late 2014 through mid-2015, a large number of major financial companies studied Bitcoin extensively (some coverage of this [here](http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/startups/2015/07/is-fidelity-getting-into-the-bitcoin-game.html), [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2015/09/09/wall-streets-first-bitcoin-forays-buy-or-build/#733e916736dc), and [here](http://fintank.net/newsletter/innovation-labs/). However, the outcome from this corporate interest was very little, aside from an increasing ""block chain without Bitcoin"" narrative. The role played by Bitcoin's stifled transaction capability in this got summed up by [Jeff Garzik in his Scaling Bitcoin presentation as seen in this /r/Bitcoin thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3kytd0/jeff_garzik_on_the_fidelity_problem_fidelity/) where he dubs the issue the ""Fidelity Problem"". More recently, [Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne explicitly mentions Bitcoin's limited throughput as a reason for considering other block chain solutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3x8o0u/maybe_were_not_going_to_use_the_bitcoin/). To assume this consideration has no effect on slowing corporate adoption of Bitcoin, nor on driving adoption to alternatives is utterly naive.  

The ""damn good reasons"" for limiting block size have from day one been purely theoretical. Market forces as well as individual miner self-interest would ultimately limit block sizes even lacking any hard coded limit. The hypothetical attack that large miners could employ against smaller miners entails many real counterattack vectors which would expose the attacker to huge losses. However, from an abundance of caution, a conservative block size limit can be employed that eliminates any meager possibility of such risk without smothering the overall networks usefulness, and *while* alternative scaling solutions are being developed. Bitcoin's history to date, as well as the continued operation of other block chains which have huge headroom between their average block sizes and their block size limits (e.g. Litecoin's current average block size relative to its effective 4 MB block size limit) bears this out.

When Satoshi implemented the 1 MB block size limit, it was between 50x and 100x as large as the average block size at the time. Since then, Bitcoin has worked fine for years with the large amount of block size headroom. Today, a raise of the limit to 2 MB, 8 MB, or even 20 MB would put the it at much less than 30x the current average block size, and thus be much more conservative than SN's original implementation.

1352,"&gt; Home Depot Files Antitrust Lawsuit Against Visa, MasterCard  

&gt; Home improvement retailer says new chip cards remain less secure than cards used elsewhere in world  

---  

&gt; By ROBIN SIDEL  
&gt; Updated June 15, 2016 4:32 p.m. ET  
&gt; 42 COMMENTS  

&gt; Home Depot Inc. filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. reigniting claims from a decade ago that merchants pay too much for debit- and credit-card transactions and adding new contentions about the effectiveness of chip-based cards to reduce fraud.  

&gt; The lawsuit comes several years after Home Depot and hundreds of other retailers opted out of a settlement, then valued at $7.25 billion, in a price-fixing case that addressed many of the same issues.  

&gt; This time, the do-it-yourself retailer also contends that Visa and MasterCard colluded to prevent the adoption of new chip-based cards that require consumers to enter a personal identification number, or PIN, to authorize a transaction.  

&gt; Visa and MasterCard know perfectly well that a signature alone, without the additional step of requiring a PIN, provides virtually no protection against many types of payment card fraud, Home Depot said in the lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the northern district of Georgia.  

&gt; The new chip cards being rolled out in the U.S. are embedded with a computer chip. This creates a unique code for each transaction, reducing the chance that criminals can create counterfeit cards.  


&gt; Chip cards have long been used around the world, where they often require a PIN instead of a signature.  

&gt; U.S. bank executives have said that they dont want to burden Americans with a PIN when they are using their credit cards at the checkout line.  

&gt; The banks collect higher merchant fees for signature-based credit-card transactions than PIN-based ones.  

&gt; While chip-and-PIN authentication is proven to be more secure, it is less profitable for Visa, MasterCard, and their member banks and it provides a greater threat to their market dominance, the lawsuit claimed.  

&gt; The legal action also contends that Visa and MasterCard, which set the so-called interchange fees collected by banks, are engaged in price-fixing that prevent competition for merchant acceptance. We had hoped to resolve our claims outside of litigation but those efforts proved to be unsuccessful, Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes said.  

&gt; Visa said it is aware of the lawsuit. It is seeking to transfer the case to a federal court in Brooklyn that is handling other opt-out cases filed by merchants including Target Corp. and 7-Eleven Inc. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. also opted out of the 2012 merchant settlement, but later settled separately.  

&gt; MasterCard said the lawsuit wasnt a surprise given Home Depot opted out of the 2012 settlement. It also said it leaves the decision on how to verify cardholder identity, via PIN or signature, to the merchant and card-issuing financial institution.  

&gt; Regardless of how the cardholders identity is confirmed, the chip makes data much more secure, rendering it almost useless to create fraudulent cards or transactions, MasterCard said.  

&gt; The Home Depot lawsuit comes a month after Wal-Mart sued Visa for the right to choose how customers authorize debit-card purchases. The retailer wants customers to use a PIN, but Visa requires that shoppers can have the choice between a PIN and a signature.

When Bitcoin launched in 2009 there were no bitcoins in existence, so the system is designed to issue new coins to miners on a set schedule: a reward every 10 minutes, with the reward amount halving every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years). The initial block reward in 2009 was 50 bitcoins. This halved to 25 bitcoins in 2013, and is predicted to halve to 12.5 bitcoins this July.

1359,"Primarily, this will happen if the transaction in question was sent from a wallet that continues to broadcast it periodically. In these cases, the first thing you need to do is to stop this continuing process. How you do this will differ by wallet.  

If the transaction is not still being broadcast by the sending wallet, the 72 hour period is still just a rough estimate, as each node maintains its own mempool along with its rules of how to handle transactions in its mempool. In most cases, nodes that go offline (e.g. via crashes or rebooting for maintenance etc.) have their mempools cleared, so to some extent this is a random process.  

Finally, anyone who downloaded and kept a copy of the original raw transaction can also be rebroadcasting it. I'm not sure if some nodes even exhibit this behavior, though if they do, I think the percentage of nodes that do it is not high. If this is the case, depending on how it's being done,  I don't know a sure way to send a higher fee double-spend while the rebroadcasting is ongoing.",2016-06-18 06:44:11+00:00,d4e1zhn,3.0,t1_d4diuvk,36324.0,btc

1364,"In most markets, Bitcoin volume is still quite small, so while fake trading can create froth and volume it can't drive prices up or down significantly (a caveat to this is if an exchange is already throwing up red flags by delaying or preventing withdrawals as with MtGox--none of the current significant exchanges are exhibiting this behavior). Funds must settle outside of exchanges after all, whether on the block chain or in traditional banks, so ""fake"" price moves can't be sustained.  

While Bitcoin does have characteristics that facilitate dark market use, its innovations also shine wherever traditional currencies or traditional stores of value (I.e. gold) are used. This has lead just about every major bank and financial company to start investigating the block chain, the technology Bitcoin pioneered. Most are still trying to implement ""private"" block chains which have unproven security and give up many of the advantages of a public, open block chain, but an increasing number are realizing that Bitcoin or another open crypto-currency has advantages that can't be ignored.  

There's currently a schism in the Bitcoin community over how to proceed with scaling innovations. The current incumbents are intentionally maintaining a self-imposed limit on Bitcoin transaction capability growth (concerned over potential loss of decentralization if growth is uncontrolled). The other faction believes that market forces and/or coded solutions could safely allow this limit to be raised or essentially removed completely. Nevertheless, if this conflict holds back Bitcoin, its open-source innovations will bloom in  other crypto-currencies that are not similarly restricted.  

On the other hand, several promising innovations seem to be relatively near at hand, and markets seem to be responding to Bitcoin's dominant market position, it's unrivalled security, imminent block subsidy having, predictable supply issuance, controlled inflation which will eventually become slight predictable deflation, programmable and permissionless platform for innovation, and its ability to transfer value and achieve immutable consensus without any centralized third party.",2016-06-17 02:25:52+00:00,d4cic97,2.0,t1_d4cdn12,7045.0,worldnews

1366,"With that much value at stake, you should at least try poking around with it yourself. The first thing I'd do is make some byte-for-byte clones of the HDD, and then you can experiment with the copies. I'm not sure if a hardware duplicator or manufacturer's software as suggested here:  

http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/259494-32-creating-exact-copy-image-hard-drive  

would be best.  

Are you sure the entire partition was over-written, or perhaps just the partition table? If only the partition table was deleted or damaged, there are utilities that may help. If the entire partition was over-written, for instance by a secure wipe operation, recovering data is theoretically possible, but perhaps practically impossible. In any case, if you have byte-for-byte clones, you can try the various approaches without losing any original data.  

As far as using a professional service and being concerned about being exposed, I guess there are two concerns here. First is cost: if you are going to disclose why you are spending so much to try to recover the drive data, you may want to try to negotiate a payment based on amount recovered. There will probably still be some up-front cost, but it should be less than without the chance of a big $ recovery for the service. Taking this route of course means you'll need to live with the fact that you may be exposing yourself as a Bitcoin whale. If you are willing to give up your privacy in this regard, you might even prevail upon the service you use that this would serve as a good promotional success story for them if they are able to pull it off.  

Secondly: if the entire partition is truly encrypted, you can use a service without disclosing what the data is you're trying to recover. If they are able to recover the partition and it passes CRC or other integrity checks, your original key should still unlock it in the privacy of your own home. But this means you'd need to front the cost of the recovery effort.

1439,"By ROBERT WALL  
June 1, 2016 7:31 a.m. ET  

DUBLIN—Concerns in the financial community about doing deals in Iran are hampering Airbus Group SE’s ability to close a multibillion-dollar aircraft deal with Tehran, the European plane maker’s head of sales said Wednesday.  

“We have to find ways to get money out of Iran through the banking system,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer for customers. While progress has been made, it has been slower than expected, Mr. Leahy said.  

Banks remain reluctant to do deals now that the U.S. and European governments are looking to foster transactions, after facing fines imposed by U.S. regulators on lenders with Iran dealings when western sanctions were in place.  

“They are all very shy,” Mr. Leahy said.  

Iran, with a population of more than 80 million and pent-up demand for travel after years of isolation, represents one of the few large remaining untapped markets for new planes. Mr. Leahy said Iran has “an ancient fleet” that needs replacing and will enjoy growth as the country’s economy recovers.  

IranAir Chief Executive Farhad Parvaresh acknowledged that the banking issue is one of the biggest hurdles to closing plane deals.  

The airline is also in talks Boeing Co., the world’s largest plane maker by deliveries, about a potential order. IranAir has now met twice with the U.S. company and talks are progressing, Mr. Parvaresh said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He wouldn't say when a deal might be sealed.  

The banking issue goes beyond the airplane sector. Oil companies also have struggled to line up big banks to back deals. They have, in some cases, had to resort to barter arrangements or using smaller banks.  

That is a system also working for plane makers. Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR is putting together to a mix of banks and lessors to help finance the euro-denominated sale of 40 of its planes to Iran, the plane maker’s Chief Executive Patrick de Castelbajac said. The company hopes to deliver the first of its regional planes by the end of the year.  

The Airbus deal is far larger, though, making it more difficult to work without big financial institutions. Iran announced a deal to buy 118 airliners from Airbus valued at $27 billion at list price. The deal, which hasn’t been completed yet, includes everything from Airbus single-aisle planes to 12 of its flagship A380 superjumbos, which carry a list price of $432.6 million, though buyers typically get discounts.  

“If you don’t sort it out, there aren’t going to be any deals done,” Mr. Leahy said.  

The delay is limiting Airbus’s ability to quickly satisfy some of IranAir’s most immediate demands, Mr. Leahy indicated. Though planes are available for delivery, the number has dwindled.  

The reluctance of bankers isn’t the only obstacle to completing agreements for jetliner sales. Airbus and others are still waiting approval to sell their planes from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Mr. de Castalbajac said a decision was expected months ago. The U.S. government is facing a flood of license applications, not just for aircraft deals, he said.  

Airbus commercial airplane boss Fabrice Brégier Tuesday said the company was making progress securing the export licenses for the deal, but that more work needed to be done. He remained optimistic the deal would be completed this year.  

IranAir’s Mr. Parvaresh said he was hopeful that once the export licenses are issued, banks would feel more comfortable financing such deals.

Many of those that believe in the promise of cryptocurrencies but who are concerned that the current Bitcoin state of affairs is eroding its first-mover advantage are diversifying or moving completely to altcoins. My problem with this strategy is that none of the alternatives seems to me to have a certain advantage over Bitcoin, even when you consider its existing scaling stagnation and developer centralization. Ethereum, for instance, is a current darling, but I have strong reservations about its unsolved proof-of-stake issues as well as its lack of scaling innovation, among other things (one example: its added block chain overhead should prove a bigger bloat concern than it is in Bitcoin as Ethereum continues to grow).  

As far as investing in cryptos is concerned, I'm just adding somewhat less to my Bitcoin investment than I would if the Bitcoin Core and block size limit issues did not exist. I still prefer advocating for solutions to Bitcoin's problems rather than jumping ship to an existing alternative. However, new cryptos spring up all the time.

Even if the Lightning Network (and the Thunder implementation of it) were available tomorrow, it wouldn't avoid the existing chilling effect on outside investment and mainstream use of Bitcoin network, the fractured nature of the community (both devs and users), the apparent cap and/or downward pressure on bitcoin price, and the potentially accelerating erosion of Bitcoin's first mover advantage. What was really needed was action to raise the block size limit around 18 months ago.  

Now if you are hoping that Lightning/Thunder will improve things, neither can be implemented until CSV and SegWit come into effect. Based on [this recent thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4kgpe5/whats_the_status_of_segregated_witness/) on the censored Bitcoin subreddit, it's looking like SegWit won't reach this milestone until well into 2017. After that, LN and all it's implementations will still need to be introduced, along with hubs and/or decentralized routing, followed by adoption. I wouldn't be surprised if this all takes years rather than the promised months, and we don't know if any of it will live up to promises, or if the market will find that the system's inherent drawbacks make it unpalatable.  

All this instead of moving forward with scaling development *in parallel* with having a conservatively raised block size limit. It simply boggles the mind.",2016-05-22 07:25:46+00:00,d3ezgjd,1.0,t3_4kh2y7,11719.0,btc

Here you are either buying into Core/Blockatream's simplistic black and white mentality, or you are blanketly misrepresenting the sentiment among those seeking to raise the black size limit (or quite possibly both). Of course work on scaling options should continue on all fronts, but that does not mean a self-imposed artificial limit on a technology that has shown itself to work for the last seven years makes sense.

1513,"&gt; His name is a perfect anagram, if you remove and add a few letters  

&gt; This week a man called Craig Steven Wright went public with the claim that he was the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. Opinion is divided over whether he really is Satoshi. Some experts were persuaded; others are unsure and indeed even he now seems less convinced about jumping into the limelight. What I want to know, however, is how we can be sure he is the real Craig Steven Wright.  

&gt; There are, after all, inconsistencies in his story. Mr Wright  or is it Mr Steven Wright, no one seems sure  is described as a Sydney businessman and computer scientist. And yet the real Craig Steven Wright apparently comes from Brisbane. Late last year someone calling himself Craig Steven Wright denied being Satoshi and yet, just a few months later he insists that he is. The latest claimant to the mantle of Craig Steven Wright says that he just wants to be left alone, but reliable sources say that a man using the same name and answering to a very similar physical description hired a team of public relations gurus to stage manage his revelation.  

&gt; The bitcoin community is divided. Some say that the real Craig Steven Wright actually spells Steven with a PH. Others have taken to Reddit to post detailed debunking. One subreddit noted that the real Craig Steven Wright could easily prove his identity by sending out an email with his original Hotmail account. If he is the real CSW he would still have his Hotmail password and could just send his friends an email saying that his was the real CSW, said one. The man claiming to be Mr Wright (or Mr Steven Wright) insists that he has forgotten the password since it is over 10 years since he used Hotmail and that his account has been deactivated. But sceptics says the real CSW would not have let his account lapse.  

&gt; Some suggested he could prove his identity by producing the cryptographic key to his first home in Brisbane. Mr Wright says he handed over the keys when he moved out but in any case he could have had a spare cryptographic key cut at the shoe repairers. Or Craig Steven Wright may be a chatbot built by Microsoft to wind up people on Twitter.  

&gt; But some are convinced. Journalists from the BBC, GQ and the Economist said they had seen a Blockbuster movies membership card from 2002 with his name on it and an unreturned DVD of the The Manchurian Candidate. The Economist did note there were things that were unproven. For example the man did not recall the address of the Blockbuster store and it is well known that the real CSW did not like Frank Sinatra. GQ added that the real Craig Wright would have preferred the remake with Denzel Washington.  

&gt; Supporters say that since the real Craig Steven Wright is being investigated by the Australian tax authorities, there is little reason to pretend to be him. On the other hand since the real CSW may be Satoshi Nakamoto and sitting on 45m bitcoin perhaps there is an incentive after all. Then there are those who believe that Craig Steven Wright is indeed CSW but doubt that he is also Satoshi. Then again, his name is a perfect anagram of Satoshi Nakamoto, if you remove C, G, E, P, W, H and two Rs and add two Os, two As, an S, K and M.  

&gt; This dilemma is one we may come to face in the future. I dont mean that we will all have to prove we are Craig Steven Wright. Im certainly not, although there are those on Reddit who point out that the real Craig Steven Wright would deny it at first. No, the issue is proving we are who we say we are at a time when automation, hacking and identity theft are leaving us ever exposed to such challenges. When anyone can use your name on social media or email, how do you prove you are the real you? When hackers can steal your credit card and bank details will it become more difficult to persuade a robo-banker that you do own your account?  

&gt; I dont pretend these issues are insurmountable; they clearly arent. But with increased automation the identity requirements must become more demanding. Will I need a DNA sample or retinal scan to verify my bank account in extremis?  

&gt; So how does the man calling himself Craig Steven Wright prove he is CSW and not a hoaxer? Its tricky. If only there was some technology; a kind of public ledger or  oh I dont know  a blockchain, by which independent sources could verify he is who he says.

1535,"&gt; That tweet is pretty factual.  

We'll have to agree to disagree on that. I think it's clear from transaction growth trends that available average block size space is decreasing steadily, therefore scarcity can hardly be a myth.  

I definitely wouldn't say Szabo goes as far as Luke-jr, but he also fails to directly consider that any actual usage of the Bitcoin network requires non-zero block size. Since technology continues to march forward, a truly practical block size limit would need to be a living compromise. The existing 1 MB limit can be safely raised without significantly compromising decentralization. In fact one of the earliest proposers of the 2 MB limit was Adam Back himself. The original 1 MB limit was arbitrarily applied, has no technical significance whatsoever, and was outdated years ago.

I'm fairly sure Electrum, Multibit and Armory do as well. It's also available, though less common in mobile and web wallets.  

The only issue with signing a message is that it reveals a public key (assuming it wasn't made public previously), which increases the vulnerability of associated funds to quantum (and possibly other attacks), so it might be simpler just to move some of his early coins. If I were to sign a message, I'd subsequently move the coins anyway just to keep them as secure as possible.

Up until the invention of the block chain, those relying on bookkeeping records have always been required to place a lot of trust in the party doing the actual bookkeeping.  

What's revolutionary about the block chain is that it introduced a new paradigm which makes bookkeeping a tractable problem for automation rather than the previously required human interaction. I think of each block in a block chain as a chunk of officially settled transactions, perhaps akin to a shift worth of work at a bank or an accounting firm.  

From there you can get into the nitty gritty of how cryptography, bitcoin mining, and the peer-to-peer network ensure the system is trustless and decentralized.

1625,"Where do you get ""many""? SegWit is complex and when deployed as a soft fork involves kludgey code. In all cases, it's complexity will place quite a demand upon Bitcoin software developers elsewhere in the ecosystem. That said, it may still be the best solution to solve issues like malleability.  

Because it is orders of magnitude more complex than simply raising the block size limit, it's onerous that Core/Blockstream would obstruct on-chain growth that has proven itself over the last seven plus years just to shove their SegWit chosen solution down the community's throat first. SegWit could just as easily be deployed as a clean hard fork after (or at the same time as) raising the block size limit to an extremely conservative 2 MB, an amount initially proposed by Adam Back himself. This would've removed any pressure to rush SegWit, allowing complete and well-paced testing, possible alternatives to be considered, and allow the other software in the Bitcoin ecosystem to get further on their way towards being ready for SegWit's deployment.  

Having said all of that, I still don't see ""many"" people anywhere that flat out hate SegWit. It's an innovation that even with its inherent complexity, may prove to be the best solution to malleability. It's just that, if it is ""the"" solution, it should be allowed to demonstrate this openly and fairly against alternatives without censorship, agenda steering, stacking market forces with rebates, back-door and private lobbying of miners, and utilizing awkward soft fork code.

1644,"&gt; Who is restricting competition?  

Anyone who refuses to consider raising the block size limit, a parameter that was always intended to be a *temporary* restriction with a stated plan for raising from almost day one. This includes but is not limited to most Core (former Qt) devs from the past two years or more, the entirety of the aptly named Blockstream company, Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, Luke-jr, et. al.  

If the limit were raised, all scaling options could compete openly. As it is, only off-chain solutions get forced upon the entire community.  

&gt; No it is not.  

Good argument, you've convinced me! /s  

&gt; Agreed. Luckily nobody is advocating doing that.  

I'm glad you agree, but I've got to disagree that nobody is advocating for it. Many Blockstream/small block limit supporters openly support a Core-only Bitcoin developer team. Moreover, Blockstream and Core devs refusal to quickly and clearly denounce /u/theymos' censorship and agenda steering over a period of months speaks volumes about their priorities and intent. Their recent partial and politic statement weakly distancing them from theymos' actions only came in response to many weeks of growing community pressure immediately prior.  

&gt; For example BTCD.  

Only accepting alternative clients that seek to work exactly as Core prescribes is hardly supporting developer decentralization.  

&gt; However, creating a deliberately incompatible client, which will fork the chain into two, without strong consensus, should be treated as an attack on the network.  

Extreme nonsense and FUD. As you certainly know already, nearly all existing and planned clients which may allow the block size limit to be raised only start after 750 of the most recent 1000 blocks show support for the new version. Claiming this is ""without strong consensus"" simply shows your intent to mislead, obfuscate, and obstruct.  

&gt; ... should be treated as an attack on the network.  

Already reverting to the standard divisive, unproductive language and characterization, I see. Why not just admit that offering choice simply enhances freedom for the Bitcoin community?  

&gt; An appropriate response to the attack is to rally behind the existing rules. Bitcoin simply does not work if we do not have consensus on the existing rules.  

Consensus cannot be predetermined nor reached with the suppression of open discussion. How can the true choice of the community be determined if the ability to select among options is never handed to them?  

&gt; An appropriate response to the attack is to rally behind the existing rules. Bitcoin simply does not work if we do not have consensus on the existing rules.  

I refute your assertion that I am misrepresenting anyone, and I challenge you to be specific in your accusations.  

&gt; Your view:  
We should have competing incompatible implementations  

In fact it is you that is doing the misrepresentation, as I cite in the above quote. I support true developmental decentralization in Bitcoin, which requires any and all consensus rule options be fully available to the community at large, not only those decided on solely by any subset.  

&gt; We should have competing compatible implementations  

How do fully compatible implementations compete at all?  

&gt; ... strong consensus across the community before activation  

Most obstructionists to raising the temporary block size limit, which may or may not include you, refuse to acknowledge the existing consensus mechanisms in XT, Classic and Unlimited, and even will not *begin* discussions as to what exactly is meant by ""strong consensus"" at all. I subscribe to Nakomoto consensus as put forth in the white paper. The existing coded 750 blocks of the last 1000 blocks threshold goes significantly further than that already.  

&gt; Your false representation of your opponent's view...  

You are again making unsubstantiated claims. How is my representation in any way false? You clearly could give details if you had any, but again and again you simply spew accusations and FUD without any substance or evidence.

1758,"&gt; ... I always thought they are mostly talking about outer contamination with radioactive material (caesium, iodine, etc.) and not inherently radioactive water.  

I'm not sure to be honest. But I do know depending on the type, quantity and energy of the radiation, the water itself can get activated. In fact, the water itself probably gets activated the longer it contains highly radioactive contaminants as well, as those isotopes gradually break down and release radiation. And finally, during the nuclear accident itself cooling water was likely activated directly by free neutron flux from fission in the fuel rods (or from the melted aftermath).

Since heavy water occurs in non-trivial amounts in nature and it's not considered a danger, it's got to decay more benignly.~~ You're right that deuterium is a stable isotope of hydrogen, whereas tritium has a half-life of some 12+ years.

1775,"&gt; I don't think it is really being avoided.  

If that's the case, I'm sure you'll happy to link me to someone claiming loss of decentralization is an issue who then gives even a rough level of node count that could be considered satisfactorily decentralized. The simple fact is, the number of full nodes has been steadily dropping since light wallets started to come on the scene and be widely used. We don't have a historical precedent for a steady-state level of fully contributing node count since that time. So all I'm looking for is a rough amount to form the basis of discussion. 4,500 is clearly to few to those believing this is an issue, so is 6,000 good? 8,000? 10,000? 50,000?  

&gt; I don't believe that's accurate.  

Again you disagree with me, but fail to provide any evidence to the contrary. Where is the documentation of research or modeling. Surely a link or two is available.  

You make blank contentions, such as nodes struggling with bandwidth requirements but offer no substantive evidence. In fact, if so many nodes are struggling with bandwidth, wouldn't that essentially prevent the current surge in total nodes we are now seeing?  

&gt; It is estimated that about 60% of the transactions in blocks are pure spam.  

You were just the one arguing that Bitcoin is a highly or perfectly trustless system. Wouldn't being permissionless to use then be a corollary? If those transactions are fee paying and miners choose to mine them, who in a decentralized system gets to decide whether they are Spam or not? If such a determination is allowed isn't that an even worse degradation of Bitcoin's inherent decentralized and permissionless characteristics that what might possibly be caused by raising the limit to a measly 2 MB?  

Clearly there is much skewing of interpretation based on inherent bias. For instance, you lament:  

&gt; ... Bitcoin would become too centralized then it will become susceptible to very nasty, possibly fatal attacks (enforceable government regulations on nodes, DoS attacks, Sybil attacks). Such unhealthy situation destroys trust in Bitcoin as a system that cannot be meddled with by any malicious actor and even before a fatal attack would happen, Bitcoin would have little value left and be more dead than alive.  

Yet again, if this is such a dangerous risk, at the already perilous level of ~4,500 nodes some such incidences must already have been occurring? Any evidence, reports, links of such dangers?  

On the other hand, I observe the notable lack of such incidents of some level of evidence that the current number of nodes is still significantly higher than necessary for the current level of Bitcoin use and participation. I don't have a link handy, but research was posted on Reddit of the minimum number of nodes which would not restrict Bitcoin usage at current levels and I believe the result was actually in the hundreds.  

&gt; Core devs here favor a better-safe-than-sorry approach, and don't want to frivolously make changes that may turn out to be an existential risk to Bitcoin.  

If such a cautious course could be taken without hampering Bitcoin's usefulness, market valuation, and leading to capital flight to altcoins, I would not be concerned. But in my view that's not the case, and everyday there seems to be more evidence that my concerns are well founded.  

Lastly, I would just add that anyone concerned about the decentralization of Bitcoin should start with improving the area where the project is currently the most centralized: it's code development and deployment. True supporters of decentralization should support multiple development projects, much as Gavin and Jeff have.",2016-03-06 11:47:16+00:00,d0pip0n,17.0,t1_d0ph8m2,6399.0,btc
1776,"Sure. I definitely see that I could've expressed that part more clearly. I was trying to capture how Bitcoin is a ""good enough"" solution to one form of the Byzantine Generals' problem. It does not have the exactness that would arise from a system built upon a rigorous, proved solution to a simplified, idealized expression of the problem itself. To my knowledge this is simply because no such proof has yet been achieved. For our discussion, this is really just an aside. My real point is that the miners and nodes in between the ""peers"" in your example introduce a large amount of stochastic inexactness as well as some (hopefully rare and highly unlikely) possible failure modes (i.e. orphaned chains, network forks, 51% attacks, etc.) The end result is having this as the ""pneumatic tubes"" between you and me make this system dramatically less trustworthy than if it was just you directly handing me a $10 bill. Mind you, Bitcoin is still a dramatic improvement on legacy systems.

&gt; I could make the exact same statement as you, but I would argue that Bitcoin is imperfect because it is still depending on the miners and nodes to keep it trustless. Too little nodes or a group of miners getting over 50% of the hash power would break Bitcoin.  

&gt; In the tube system metaphor, too little nodes is the equivalent of having the tube run partly outside the building at the public street. Now someone can force the tube open and steal the canister while it is in transit.  

I don't disagree with you here, but these points only go further in demonstrating that Bitcoin has numerous areas where it can't ever be perfect with respect to trustlessness or decentralization.  

So if we accept that, than any discussion of whether increasing the block size limit might reduce or prevent improving upon decentralization or trustlessness must start with how much of these characteristics is actually needed, and whether focusing on them to the exclusion of other capabilities of Bitcoin is something that:  

1) would fulfill the original intent of Bitcoin  

and  

2) is a desirable outcome to the community as a whole

From what I've seen, any attempt to quantify necessary levels of decentralization or trustlessness is avoided by small blockers. In addition, claims that raising the limit (particularly to just 2 MB) would significantly detract from existing decentralization and trustlessness is never backed with any research or modeling. Meanwhile, the effects of approaching and bouncing off the 1 MB limit are getting more and more obvious not just to the Bitcoin community, but to mainstream media and to mainstream observers as well.",2016-03-06 08:56:57+00:00,d0pgar4,15.0,t1_d0p92m8,17787.0,btc

1782,"I'm sorry, but you don't get it. The fact of the existence and functionality of nodes and miners puts a lie to your simplistic representation of Bitcoin as being ""peer-to-peer"" in any sense that approaches exact decentralization or trustlessness. The fact the nodes and miners themselves are not truly decentralized or trustless only amplifies this reality.  

Now, don't get me wrong. Bitcoin is clearly far superior in it's approximations of decentralization and trustless than any system before it, but it was never intended to be, nor can it ever be made to be, perfect in these categories.  

&gt; If there's too little nodes...

The mere fact that you can quantify a factor in Bitcoin that would increase or decrease decentralization or trustlessness demonstrates that the system can never be perfect in these respects. So the question instead moves to how much trustlessness or decentralization *is enough*. Tiny blockers insist that these are the absolute and critical principals to uphold, but fail to ever define their limits or criteria. Without such definitions, meaningful discussions over how tradeoffs should be set cannot be held.  

Lacking such informed discussion, I'd prefer to put my faith in Satoshi's original vision, and let the unfettered free market arrive at equilibria. However, for this to occur, artificially imposed limits that were always intended to be temporary, such as the 1 MB block size limit, must be raised once they start to interfere.

1786,"Will SegWit *actually* be deployed next month? Even if the code is ready as promised, real deployment is still an open question now that it seems less than 75% of nodes run Core, and there are less Core 0.12 nodes than Classic (who's ""contentious"" now, Core?) Widely available Classic pools are only just starting to become available too, so we still need to see how much more of Core's hash rate will erode to Classic.  

If and when it does finally deploy, will ecosystem software (i.e. wallets, exchanges, payment systems, etc.) be ready to capitalize? It's much more complicated than a simple block size limit increase, so development, testing and bug fixing for SegWit compatible code across all the rest of Bitcoin community software will take some time. I'm sure no one even on the Core side can guarantee that the entire ecosystem of Bitcoin will be SegWit-ready on day one, so the effective block size limit increase will initially be much less than what the system is fully capable of.  

On the other hand, a block max change would require basically no ecosystem code adjustments apart from upgraded nodes, and the full 2 MB of the new limit would be fully available to the network immediately following the activation grace period.  

Finally, SegWit *at best* gives an effective block size limit increase of about 1.6x to 1.75x. Upon finally becoming fully effective, it's likely that a 1 MB block size limit enhanced only by SegWit will already be stifling the network again, just as the current limit is strangling Bitcoin right now.

NotBitcoinXT was created and designed as an attempt to sabotage a coded voting mechanism -- starkly unethical behavior. The optional code added by Hearn to XT was intended to allow people to run the software they choose free from underhanded DDoS attacks.

1913,"Well there's a wide range between Bitcoin being ""killed"" and having its network security vary some, or even a lot. Essentially, the security of the network is tied to Bitcoin's market cap. The higher the valuation, the more value is paid to miners, and the higher the overall security. What happens many scores of years down the road when the block subsidy is dramatically less than it is now is still an open question, but miners anticipated the last halving and transitioned fairly seamlessly. I would be surprised if the upcoming halving was substantially more dramatic.  

&gt; And what happens while the network difficulty transitions?  

Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks or roughly every two weeks, but you may already know that. I suspect you're asking about when difficulty adjusts downwards. This is somewhat more rare, but it does happen and basically it's been normal operations when it occurs. If something happened to cause a sudden *substantial* increase or decrease in difficulty, I'd expect more disruption, but we've never had a historical episode to judge from. Even major disruptions should be recovered from over time IMO.

I find almost all of Back's posts distinctly lacking in forthrightness. He seems to be particularly taken with not assuming good faith, and casting aspersion via abusive characterization. He attempts to steer discussions for his own purposes in ways he seems to believe are subtle, but based on comment replies it seems he's not fooling many people. With regards to the NotBitcoinXT discussion, he takes every opportunity to expound on how underhanded Sybil tactics might be used and to point the reader to the implementation his prior suggestions likely inspired. He attempts to feign disapproval, but he can only go as far as to say such tactics ""would not be constructive"", rather than to take the direct stand that unethical behavior should not be encouraged or condoned. I believe it's similar thought processes/justification that lead to his comments about DDoSing XT nodes (which admittedly I have still yet to find).

In fact in his response, he repeats ""hard forks are dangerous"" several times, which hardly aligns with your interpretation that he is saying here that hard forks are acceptable.

What's wrong is the *artificial* fee market forced on the network and users by maintaining what was initially intended to be a *temporary* anti-DoS feature. Such an artificial fee market is the equivalent to a central bank acting as a cartel (or as another post called it, a ""*core*tel""), negatively affecting fee predictability, microtransaction use, general block chain innovation, stunting overall adoption, and driving potential users to unrestricted alternatives. It allows a centralized minority in what was intended to be a fully decentralized system to rig characteristics for the benefit of a few, obstructing its permissionless nature for the rest of the community.  

Ironically, for the small block/Blockstream proponents, the artificial fee market will also serve to hamstring a system many in their camp tout as a response to much criticism: the Lightning Network (LN). The wide use cases (including nearly instantly confirmed microtransactions) and effective trustlessness of LN get severely curtailed as fees rise. The unpredictable nature of fees under an artificial fee market will degrade LN's usability and effectiveness as well.

This is fine, but it's only an attack on miners with poor network connectivity (like rural Chinese miners that have weaker Internet and that have to deal with the GFW) *if* you manage to get it accepted by other miners and mined on top of. This is a tremendous risk to the miner that created the large block because, 1) he's got to wait until his block propagates across the network to other miners to be accepted as a valid block meanwhile another miner could find a valid smaller block that propagates much faster and invalidate his all his hash work and his attack wasting his electrical costs for creating the giant block, 2) even if his giant block propagates to other miners, they can immediately recognize it as extremely unusual or as an obvious attack and simply choose not to mine on top of it, 3) even if the large block somehow gets mined into the block chain (say one or more blocks down), miners with tons of hash power, like all the pools in China could recognize this is bad for them and deliberately create a longer chain that orphans the huge block as well as the work of any miners that tried to mine on top of it, and 4) even if all the nations that have miners and decent Internet start mining on top of the chain with the giant block, China's miners collectively still have more than 50% of Bitcoin hash power so their chain excluding the giant block would eventually become longer even if they never even saw it simply due to poor Internet speeds.

As originally presented, LN was assumed to be a solution to both instant transactions *and* microtransactions. However, if collapsing an LN channel is required to recover from bad transactions, large fees will make microtransactions completely untenable. Large fees will also make it unlikely people will set their channels to expire in short durations such as a few days or a few weeks. This means most channels will be long-duration to try to remain cost effective. Collapsing long-duration channels could lead to tying up bitcoin for much longer periods.

2022,"AA continues to be one of the most eloquent public figures advocating for Bitcoin, but I think the second half of this tweet is flat out wrong. I also saw a subsequent tweet he wrote about /r/btc contributing to the ""Balkanization"" of the Bitcoin community, which completely ignores that some issues are important enough to stand up against. Censorship and the unethical, underhanded manipulation of an ostensibly decentralized system both fit that category for me. Unfortunately, I can't find that Balkanization tweet anymore (deleted by AA?)  

Before the censorship scandal and the onset of the block size limit schism, /r/Bitcoin was already ""a cesspool of trolls, paranoia, conspiracy, infighting,"" but it normally managed to produce 3 to 5 pages of interesting and sometimes productive top threads IMO. 
Since then, I can barely find a page to a page and half of quality posts there on an average day. I wish I could say that /r/btc has already filled the void, but this hasn't yet been the case (I am still hopeful for /r/btc's future). What is clear is that /r/Bitcoin is censored and manipulated to silence one side of a critical Bitcoin issue (theymos' own posts confirm this). /r/btc, except for the last 24 hours (and some smaller notable exceptions) is not.

2027,"Actually I think each mining pool is centered on a single node, and that node is configured with whatever rules the mining pool elects for including transactions. So in this case, you'd need to find a mining pool that already only includes zero-fee transactions (pretty sure none exists), or you'd need to configure your own node to do this, then build the pool around it. Once the pool is set, you'd then need to have miners point their hashing power to this pool. The total hashing power of the pool as a fraction of the Bitcoin network's overall hashing power would be the possibility that your pool would find a suitable nonce for your transaction block first.

2040,"&gt; In a thread about this RBF crap someone was arguing how badly it was needed to deal with 'stuck' transactions and then he linked to supposed stuck transactions over a year old.  

Any ""stuck"" transaction can appear to remain in that state as long as someone or some wallet continues to re-submit it to the network in its original problematic (usually no- or low-fee) form. Without re-submission, I doubt even a transaction engineered to be ""stuck"" as long as possible would be found on most mempools after a year.  

The important point is that there's no one, official mempool. In general, any node can deal with its own mempool however it likes. I'm not aware that most nodes on the network have explicit policies to drop transactions after some default time period, but nodes generally get rebooted from time to time, which clears those specific mempools entirely.  

I'd guess the nodes used by large mining pools have more detailed mempool management policies, though. In general, my understanding is that transactions unmined and not re-submitted for three or more days start to disappear from network mempools (likely to include those of at least some large mining pools), and that's when you would start having success trying to submit a new, higher fee transaction for the same utxos.  

If it was a huge issue in a specific case, though, I'd just craft the new higher fee transaction and periodically try submitting it to the network immediately. Even better, write a script to do it and target the IPs of large pools. In an urgent, worst case scenario, someone could directly contact a large pool operator and offer a reward for them to manually include the transaction in their next mined block. The claim that ""stuck"" transactions are some sort of major problem is simply a red herring, IMHO.",2015-11-29 04:48:40+00:00,cxggxxy,1.0,t3_3unvxc,8498.0,btc

You already said BIP 103 has a date included, which I assume to be at some future time. So then what is the downside to releasing it and seeing how the community reacts?  

By the way, what is the implementation date included in BIP 103?  

&gt; Core will upgrade (as will other implementations) and recommend to upgrade once there is rough consensus from the users and technical and business and mining communities.  

There is no agreement within the community as to the definition of consensus or rough consensus, so presenting this as a finish line is projecting a mirage.  

&gt; It is false because people are claiming 101 is somehow ready and other implementations arent. This is untrue 103 is at the same stage, just no one took the ill-advised step to make binaries available before there is an attempt to gain consensus.

This is your opinion and contention. Others feel BIP 101 is tested, ready, and it has indisputably been released to the public for use.

I was replying to your statement that some devs feel miners should not vote to choose when to implement a hard fork, which I took to be referring to BIP 101's requirements of being after a specific date and after at least 750 of the last 1,000 most recently mined blocks support BIP 101 before the grace period for the fork begins. I'm generally aware of BIP 103, but I haven't heard whether it uses a different set of criteria to trigger the actual BIP 103 hard fork.  

I would expect such details to be listed explicitly wherever BIP 103 executables are available for download, as they are for every other client implementation. I've asked where such downloads can be had, but I'm not aware of having received a response. If no executables are yet on offer, then BIP 103 is not available as an implementation in the same way as the current version of Core, XT, btcsuite, etc.

Certainly, and they're free to implement a better solution if they have one.

But that consensus choice will be unlikely to coalesce if fully developed options are not put before the community. Events may now be overtaking the supporters of non-BIP 101 proposals.

2200,"&gt; To attack the network, the same reason people attack the memepool now.  

Current attacks can deny service because the small block size and the large amount of pre-existing transactions only require a small amount of additional transactions to fill each block. Thus denial of service can be accomplished for long periods at low cost. With larger block size limits the costs multiply dramatically. /u/Zaromet pointed out that I neglected pre-existing transactions in my calculations of additional cost to attack a larger block size, so see his replies for more accurate math. If an attacker was trying to fill a 100 MB block as you suggested, he would be spending more than ~275x as much based on /u/Zaromet's example.  

If you're deriving utility from putting transactions on the block chain, and you are paying fees then that's not an attack -- it's simply normal Bitcoin use.  

&gt; Why do you only consider one very specific potential motivating factor for an attack when there are many? Why is this a problem anyway, the user just needs to outbid the spam, this is the fair way of allocating space.  

I'm not considering a narrow case, I'm describing existing attacks. If you want to discuss something different, please specify what you're referring to. The problem is user's shouldn't need to outbid ""spam"" because the system is capable of making transaction flooding attacks costly and therefore less likely and less lengthy when they do occur.  

&gt; If the block size limit is increased then the fee may fall, therefore it may cost less than 8x as much. It may even cost the same amount, you just need to outbid users.  

Fees will not artificially rise as they would with a forced 1 MB block size limit, but senders concerned about confirmation speed will always want to incentivize miners to include their transactions. Therefore fees are not likely to fall significantly (particularly in $/€ terms). In fact, with the halving not far off, transaction fees will soon make up a larger proportion of total miner reward.

&gt; Fee market  

Forcing an artificially small transaction space will simply make it easier for attackers to affect Bitcoin and to manipulate the fee market.  

&gt; An orphaned block could include conflicting transactions, this would be a classic double spend. Bitcoin was designed to prevent this.  

No blocks (orphaned or not) ever include conflicting transactions. Legitimate transactions in orphaned blocks simply get included in another block on the longest chain. Orphans happen every day right now, yet double-spend risk is low. And rising orphan risk for one subset of miners does not mean that the average orphan risk for miners overall will rise. Hash rate would simply migrate to pools that have better Internet access.",2015-10-20 17:01:30+00:00,cw6jwq2,7.0,t1_cw5gfxe,79290.0,bitcoinxt

2209,"&gt; ... I could put 100 MB in each block if fees are low enough.  

Not if the limit was 8 MB you couldn't. But for argument's sake, let's say there's no limit. Why would you want to? If there's no limit, you're not filling a block so you're not affecting other users. It's entirely up to miners whether they'd want to try to stuff all of your transactions into a single block or take their time with smaller blocks, or ignore your low-fee transactions altogether. All you'd be doing is pouring your money down the drain (or tying up your funds until all the unmined transactions disappear from mempools).  

&gt; What makes you say it increases the cost?  

The point of such transaction floods is to fill blocks to deny service at a certain fee level. With larger blocks, it takes that many more transactions at the same fee level to fill a certain block. Therefore, if you want to deny service for the same amount of time, it costs more. If you want to fill 8 MB blocks, it'll cost you 8x as much to sustain the attack for the same length of time as with 1 MB blocks.  

Fees may be vastly reduced when there's nobody attacking the network, and since attacking the network would cost more and clear faster with larger blocks, they'd be less likely.  

&gt; ... more of the spam will make it on the chain.  

You have a decentralized way of determining what is or is not spam? I don't, so I prefer not to apply such labels and allow the incentives in the system to work themselves out.  

&gt; The purpose of the whole system is to reduce orphan risk, we should not push this risk to the limit.  

Nonsense. That's one parameter that *miners* consider, and they'll compete among themselves over it just as they will over ASIC efficiency, fixed costs, energy costs, bandwidth costs, real estate costs, etc. The vast majority of Bitcoin users will never need to concern themselves over orphan risk.

Also, though I admit to not following every bit of LN news, I'm somewhat surprised to not hear any buzz about the communications layer that will be necessary. In order for LN to fulfill it's promise of moving vast transactional traffic off of the block chain, a significant amount of data will need to be transferred from sender to recipient and among any LN nodes involved (i.e. signed and encumbered transactions, etc.) In a hub-and-spoke model, I was sort of OK with this not getting addressed in too much detail, since one or more centralized provider could always make their own arrangements for this. However, with a decentralized routing plan I have many questions, such as:  

* Will this communications channel now be an integral part of LN?  

* Will data be sent in the clear (which seems to go against decentralized routing), or will end-to-end encryption be used?  

* How is the privacy/anonymity of this channel being addressed?

* Will known technologies like Bitmessage and TOR be used or adapted?  

* Will communications also be decentralized, and if so, how?

Nailing the communications aspect down would definitely give a better idea of what LN will actually look like when it's released.  

Perhaps the decentralized routing system being worked on already addresses this aspect as well, but if so, how it does this is not clear to me.",2015-10-15 10:55:41+00:00,cw0i0o8,3.0,t1_cvzxkfq,46464.0,Bitcoin

Even Lightning developers can't assert with absolute certainty what the final attributes of the production product will be, so how can any outside observer know what will actually be fact or myth?  

The best that can be determined now is project intent, and even that seems to have migrated from initially being available via a hub-and-spoke model to now including decentralized routing as an integral (?) part of LN.

With enough practical necessity, those that understand the difference between baking more pizzas versus cutting more slices could help make the other camp understand.  

Don't get me wrong about actually *implementing* increased divisibility. I can see that increasing the integer space in code will be a tremendous amount of work. But if the need is clear, I'm hopeful many developers would seek to tackle it together. The fact that divisibility would be a pressing issue would also mean that bitcoin valuation would have increased tremendously from present levels.

It wouldn't make sense to me to undertake a lot of work just to shift this characteristic so that all of the atomic units are spendable *at the time*.

2331,"* Yes, you need bitcoin to open a channel.  

* Any existing wallet could incorporate LN, but new coding is required.  

* This is the big question. As originally presented, access to LN for most users would've been under a hub-and-spoke model. Hubs in such a model would've been largely responsible for routing. Now talk has shifted to a decentralized routing model, and this just posted today: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3n89cu/lightning_network_onion_routing_proposal/  
I'm not sure if this would be a complete decentralized solution including URIs or DNS-like capability, though.  

* I believe this will hinge on which routing system becomes most popular, and how it handles privacy.  

* No, LN transactions are effectively instant, and *mostly* trustless (funds can get tied up for predetermined periods of time).

2357,"&gt; I do not recall ""being as maneuverable as the F-16"" ever being a design parameter. As far as being comparable in maneuverability, that seems like something of a more reasonable claim. But I digress; before someone starts slinging ""he claimed/said,"" find an actual citation from Lockheed Martin with said claim.  

My original comment was just in response to your suggestion that anyone was expecting the F-35 would reach ""incredible dogfighter"" status. That mischaracterized the tone of the article to make it sound as if it was being unfair. As to original Lockmart claims, as I said, I don't know what they were. I'm just responding to characterizations from more than once source in the press that have gone on record that the original program specifications included matching or exceeding fourth gen fighter maneuverability.  

But that last may be the problem right there: AFAIK, a lightly loaded block 50 F-16C is probably at the very high end of fourth gen fighter maneuverability. Perhaps when compared to an average of all fighters across the generation, an F-35 fairs better. But even using this justification, the F-35 can't really be seen to *exceed* fourth gen maneuverability.  

Agree that politicians don't really know what they're talking about in terms of how much or how long a complex military development program will require. They're just trying to look like they want the most for the least $ to make a good political sound bite. The military and contractors know this going in, they understand the game. So I'm sure they're not surprised to receive criticism, fair or unfair, after the fact. The F-35 is a pretty incredible plane that can stand on its own merits.

My post was only in response to the previous comment making it sound like the press criticism was holding the F-35 to an unfair standard of needing to be an ""incredible dogfighter,"" where objectively the author did not make that claim.  

Assessed on all its merits, I think the F-35 (like most creations that emerge from the U.S. military industry) is an amazing achievement. Still, Lockmart was not able to meet *all* the goals they set out for. Perhaps doing so would've been akin to pitching a perfect game whereas they only managed a no hitter. But these military conglomerates are quite familiar with the rules of the game, and I'm sure they expect the intense press scrutiny. Perhaps it's even part of their playbook to manage a response since it increases their likelihood of winning a contract if they initially over promise by some amount. That the F-35 did not dominate the F-16C in close combat is just a somewhat embarrassing fact, overly hyped by the media and definitely mitigated by the facts you laid out. Yet it is an inconvenient truth, and not fully acknowldeging the facts *and* the perception would be a disservice.

Its unit price was ~$150 million in 2009 dollars, whereas the F-35 is a multirole fighter engineered to result in three distinct variants and costing ~$98 - ~$116 million *initially* in today's dollars (apparently there is hope per-unit pricing will decrease as production and sales increase).

2379,"It's not whether it was a requirement of the JSF, it's whether Lockmart made the contention, and whether any such claims were a factor in their landing the contract. Are you claiming absolutely that they did not? I don't know for certain either way, and it wouldn't be the first time the media might've gotten something wrong, but I've seen the claim made in several outlets, including Popular Mechanics and Jalopnik. If you've got a source to clear this up, I'd love to see it.  

But let's say you're claim is correct. Then why not let maneuverability go completely to the dogs. That would certainly allow Lockmart to do even better in other aspects of the plane's performance, right? The reason is obvious, high-performance combat aircraft need to perform well across a wide range of characteristics. If a cutting edge fighter cannot keep up with a design first introduced in 1984, it's just not a good look.  

&gt; As for the budget/time table, the politicians set totally unrealistic standards. However, the F-35 does/will cost as much as a 4.5 gen fighter, and has a development time table in line with every other advanced jet fighter ever built (19 years, average is about 20).  

Maybe so, and if we ignore that they committed to lower costs, earlier delivery and (possibly) better performance, this would be quite commendable. But the fact is they did commit to (at least most of) the forgoing. If they knew going in it was not doable, they could have contested the requirements initially, or they could have elected not to bid. Then the onus would've landed on one of their competitors to try to achieve the (possibly untenable) goals.  

Now I recognize that the whole system of contractors bidding and *needing* to land huge contracts; the various military branches setting and even changing requirements; and the government constantly trying to reign in costs clearly contributes to this sort of dysfunctional outcome, but Lockmart also knows all this going in, so I don't feel that they're entitled to being treated with kid gloves.

If this emerges, I'd guess commercial hubs would start to pop up in the 3 - 6 months after LN becomes final. However, the forgoing discussion was about having lots of individual LN nodes which would not restrict transactions to the likes of Snowden or Assange. Large commercial hubs facilitating the majority of connections between end users (as would exist based on the original LN presentation) could definitely prevent transactions either by their own choice or at the behest of outside agencies.  

If there are decentralized routing schemes for LN or distributed meshnets being developed that might facilitate LN without the hub-and-spoke model, I doubt that they're as far along as LN itself (if for no other reason because LN itself is not yet finalized), but I'd be happy to be proved wrong.

2413,"The [block chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_%28database%29) is a type of data structure that was pioneered by [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin). The Bitcoin block chain is currently the world's largest and most established by far, so your question can't really be answered as asked. However, your confusion is understandable since many in business and media are starting to recognize the benefits that the Bitcoin block chain provides, but would prefer to divorce it from bitcoin the digital token (variously considered a currency, commodity, unit of account, etc.) Since the block chain is just a data structure, there can be an infinite number of other block chains, but there will always only be one Bitcoin block chain (putting aside some technicalities).  

Other [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) can exist built on other block chains, and these can and do compete with Bitcoin, but [none is yet close to rivaling Bitcoin's dominant position](http://coinmarketcap.com/).  

As employed in Bitcoin, the block chain requires a significant amount of complexity, effort and cost to establish when compared to traditional database-backed solutions, but it's development represents the first practical solution of [a problem that had stumped computer science for over 30 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem). Prior to Bitcoin, a truly permissionless and decentralized payment system/currency/consensus network could not exist.  

The fact that the media and businesses are now starting to publicize ""block chain technology"" without mentioning the digital token typically required (in Bitcoin's case, bitcoin with a lowercase 'b' is the digital unit) is in my opinion a red herring. In all existing permissionless, decentralized cryptocurrencies, it is the digital token and the overhead of the block chain that makes them possible. Those that trumpet ""block chain technology"" while ignoring the token or that promote mostly undeveloped and unproven ""permissioned"" block chains either do not understand that the token and the data structure are both required to achieve Bitcoin's innovative benefits, or are hyping systems which may never offer net advantages over traditional shared database systems.",2015-09-20 05:24:15+00:00,cv7nq5q,1.0,t3_3lmq31,11959.0,Bitcoin

With signed version numbers included and evaluated, you'd effectively have two separate networks and block chains, since the validity rules would be different on each.  

&gt; There is no merged mining in bitcoin. Other coins such as 
namecoin support merged mining and use the bitcoin blockchain.  

Right, I'm not saying merged mining exists in Bitcoin *now*, but in the event of two long-lived branches after a hard fork (which differentiate using a signed version identifier), miners could conceivably merge mine both post-fork block chains.

I believe this is essentially the system the exists right now with Bitcoin, and I think the fact that everyone is free to implement a hard fork at any time is a critical aspect of this.

2464,"There's no reason you are *required* to use more than one wallet. But each wallet category offers different features and capabilities. Web wallets are dependent on a centralized provider for normal access, and so are the most centralized of Bitcoin wallet choices available. Should the website become unavailable or the provider go out of business, you may need to use a recovery procedure and start another wallet before you could use your bitcoin funds normally again. On the other hand, web wallets can be accessible anywhere you have access to the Internet without requiring a particular device that has the instance of the wallet client software on it (assuming the web wallet service provider is not down, of course).  

Desktop wallets like Electrum are not fully dependent on any one single centralized service. In particular, Electrum wallets can run connected to any of many available Electrum servers, and should one become unavailable, it will automatically access another (or you can even elect to run your own). But light wallets like Electrum do always require such a connection and so are not as independent as the most decentralized choices, full node wallets like Core, XT, or Armory (though these require significant resources to run and are inconvenient in a number of ways compared to other choices).  

If by ""electrum for offline use"", you mean using Electrum for offline cold storage, that is an option that is available, but it's a more advanced (and less user friendly) implementation that achieves high security. Whether you choose to use it will depend your desire for the added security while tolerating the reduced accessibility. With good security practices, I'd feel safe keeping a typical checking account balance stored in a 2FA secured web wallet or other ""hot"" wallet. GreenAddress's multisig implementation gives you even more security than non-multisig web wallets like Blockchain.info's. However, for savings account amounts or larger, I would definitely consider employing some form of cold storage, like Electrum's offline option or purchasing a hardware wallet like a Trezor. Since cold storage takes some familiarity, choose a cold storage option, and implement and practice using it with small amounts at first to become comfortable with all of the steps (including, for instance running the offline Electrum instance from a secure and always offline PC, or alternatively from a PC booted to a standalone secure environment like TAILS).  

Normally, independent wallets like a GreenAddress wallet and an offline instance of an Electrum wallet are not ""connected"" together. They each manage their own independent pools of private keys. If you wish to have funds from one wallet usable on the other, you'd just send the funds from the source wallet to a receive address generated by the destination wallet via a normal Bitcoin transaction.

1) After you completed the settings in your Linksys router, did you save and commit/apply them (some routers have this extra step, some do not)? Did you then reboot the router? If you haven't done either of these, they're worth a try. After the reboot, check that the port settings were retained in the router.  

2) It's unlikely, but perhaps you're ISP is blocking port 8333 for some reason. You could try starting XT with the ""-port=&lt;pick_a_new_port_number&gt;"" flag, and then passing that new port number through your network, firewall, and router(s).  

3) Is your entire LAN on the same subnet? If not, then the extender may be acting as another router and also doing [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation). If it is, it should have port settings available somewhere. Otherwise, you may need to change the extender to hardware which has accessible NAT configuration, or that'll function purely as a switch or a bridge on the same subnet as your Linksys router.",2015-09-08 06:52:38+00:00,cuu7guj,1.0,t3_3k1rdd,13120.0,bitcoinxt

2477,"Thanks for providing a link, but that's hardly what I would consider a source for the claim that raising the block size *limit* will definitely result in reduced decentralization. Instead, it's just more speculative arguments, albeit more carefully documented and organized.  

A prime actual source would be a quality paper (peer-reviewed academic in the best case) that reaches the aforementioned conclusions based on modeling, research, simulation, and/or very careful consideration of *all* relevant factors (or at least as many as foreseeable). Failing that, at least a post with one or more elements from the following (likely incomplete) list:  

* That is based on past observed evidence  

* That includes consideration of as many contributing factors as possible (to wit, most pro-small block analysis are clearly flawed as they assume some or all of the following: that raising the block size limit will result in larger blocks right now; that larger blocks will exist with technology essentially equivalent to the current level of computing power, storage, and networking capability; alternatively, that any future increases in technological capability will definitely be exceeded by block size growth resulting from the raised limit; that increased orphan rate of larger blocks will not significantly disincentivize miners from using them; that miners who observe competitors actively using large block sizes to their own advantage (such as by generating and adding their own transactions to inflate block sizes) will not take action against the abusers thus resulting in even higher orphan rates for the perpetrators; that miners in general will always engage in actions which result in increased short-term profit without any consideration of longer term effects such as rebellion of pool participants, community backlash, increased market uncertainty likely resulting in lower valuations; disruption and controversy detrimentally affecting the growth of Bitcoin as a whole; and the possibility of causing enough anger among Bitcoin users that the nuclear option of forking to a new hashing algorithm is invoked.)  

* That can explain the failure of GHash.io achieving greater or complete mining centralization when they clearly offered higher profitability than their competitors, while still proving that raising the block size limit will surely result in the opposite.  

In fact, while I've seen many argue speculatively that larger block size limits as small as 2 or 4 MB will definitely result in centralization, I've yet to see anyone provide a cogent and convincing source indicating that even *a complete removal of the block size limit* would, of a certainty or even with high probability, lead to the same result.",2015-09-08 03:11:24+00:00,cuu2fcw,14.0,t1_cusy8t9,98072.0,Bitcoin

2536,"Two drastic options exist that ensure miners do not hold the ultimate vote in the community with regard to hard forks. The first would be if it's clear that the community, except for the majority of mining power, support a hard fork, then that fork could still proceed with SHA256 PoW and see where the market takes things. If an economic consensus forms around the fork before a 51% attack is conducted, miners would be incentivized to migrate to the fork. However, should the greater hashing power backing the legacy protocol manage to organize and 51% attack the fork, the second option can always be used.  

I consider the second option the nuclear option, and it is basically what OP proposes here, forking to a new hashing algorithm. Faced with this option, you can be sure that miners with millions invested in hardware would do everything in their power to avoid its occurrence.  

Neither option is desirable to the community as a whole because they would both mean tremendous disruption along with a likely severe tanking in the price of bitcoin (though, in the long term, any price shock should be temporary.) Why dance with the devil if it can be at all avoided?  

I believe invoking either option would only be remotely possible if one side dug in on an issue so abhorrent to the other that compromise becomes impossible. Personally, I don't see that happening here with BIP 101, BIP 100, or the other block size variations. Things are close enough in the various proposals that some consensus is bound to form before one of these two possibilities comes to pass.

This benefits both parties as the channel is then available to be re-used without having to open another channel (which requires an actual Bitcoin network transaction).

2552,"&gt; A merchant could send goods after receipt of a LN transaction, but if the hub went down before broadcast, then that transaction essentially never happened, and if the receiver didn't get a copy of the transaction that they can manually broadcast, then there's also the opportunity for the initiator of the LN transaction to scam the receiver.  

I don't believe this is possible because the receiver will never acknowledge that the LN send transaction has completed until he/she has already received the signed transaction allowing them to close the channel if something is amiss. Doing otherwise would really not be using the Lightning network.  

Thanks for pointing out I should have included ""at least"" when referring to the 133 MB block size, an oversight on my part. And also for the link to jstolfi's stats.  

EDIT: I also just realized from your use of the term ""broadcast"" when referring to LN, that you may be somewhat misunderstanding its use. The point is for the sender and receiver to always have a signed transaction in hand that protects them at every stage of the transaction, but that these transactions are not normally broadcast on the Bitcoin network. The signed transactions are sent only between sender and receiver, and never travel across the Bitcoin network. If the LN transaction completes properly, nothing needs to be sent to the Bitcoin network. Each party only retains the signed transactions so that they are free to close the payment channel at any time (closing the channel in this sense means one of the parties broadcasts their signed transaction directly). Otherwise, an LN channel normally only transacts with the Bitcoin network when its predesignated time period expires (or when a new channel is being opened).",2015-08-29 15:58:25+00:00,cujsxxv,9.0,t1_cujslms,615.0,bitcoinxt

Still, if it had stayed rainbows and light among developers in the Core repository, development would have remained the most centralized part of Bitcoin by far. Even now it's still pretty centralized, but I'm just glad it's at least starting to change. More importantly, XT has underlined the fact that arbitrary hierarchies will never be able to impose themselves upon or constrain Bitcoin unless the overall community allows it to happen.",2015-08-29 15:45:26+00:00,cujsikr,4.0,t1_cujrnlt,1682.0,bitcoinxt
2554,"I fully agree with you regarding the need to scale Bitcoin regardless of innovations such as LN. In fact the LN presentation I saw predicts 133 MB blocks would be required just to ensure the world's population can use a conservative number of LN transactions. However, I'm not aware of any risk of loss across the LN network as you alluded to here:  

&gt; ... there's still the risk for some people to lose their money if unbroadcast transactions are lost on the hub...

Can you explain this further? My understanding is that regardless of when a payment channel is collapsed, the sender would be made whole. The intended recipient may still be owed, but that can always be subsequently settled between the two parties if necessary (and this would only be needed since the planned LN transaction never completed to begin with).  

I also agree that regulatory uncertainties make dependence on an as yet incomplete technology dubious when compared to a direct transaction on the Bitcoin network, a known quantity that has been established now for more than six years (even if laws and regulations have yet to fully catch up).

But perhaps you're implying that government intervention will be so heavy handed that *no* LN hubs can effectively exist. That would be a much thornier problem. In such a scenario, use of LN would have to wait until someone was able to design a decentralized hub (should such a thing even be possible), or be limited to purely direct use with sender and recipient establishing their own LN channels as needed.",2015-08-29 13:24:31+00:00,cujot7z,5.0,t1_cujomdi,573.0,bitcoinxt

I'm not sure anyone can be certain inflation won't happen until years from now either. Dramatic economic changes can happen in far shorter time scales.  

The immediate inflation for a Chinese citizen right now would be if they try to purchase something directly from an international source, as that is directly where the PBoC's currency changes take direct effect. Moreover, if they want to purchase foreign assets, such as land or property, the inflation affects them right now as well. As you wrote, imported goods available in the domestic market may not see the effect today, but should get increased prices fairly quickly. Broader domestic prices, for China-sourced goods in particular, may stay unaffected for significantly longer. As the world's current largest energy importer, all of China will feel increased energy costs.  

Tight artificial peg or not, the fact is this is a sudden and dramatic change. Other international players will respond to it as such. Also, if you believe the CNBC article, the PBoC's target will be a devaluation of between 5% and 10%, so they're not done yet.

But let me understand your point. Inflation hasn't been happening, so clearly it won't be happening again. Ever? Consider the last major economic boom in the U.S. During the 90s, interest rates were being raised in an effort to reign in the overheating economy. For a good period, there did not seem to be a discernable effect. Yet when the market did turn around again after the dot-com bubble burst, even aggressive rate lowering was not enough to stem the the slide. Historically it seems to me that pulling economic levers often has a difficult to predict lag before an effect is seen, and when it manifests there can be an unexpected overshot the other direction. So after this recent sustained period of worldwide QE and near-zero and sometimes effectively negative interest rates, could forces for the next change in market direction be lurking somewhere unseen in the world economy? I for one wouldn't be surprised. I can't tell you if they're will be sudden high inflation, or if there will be, I can't predict what the mechanism will be that brings it about. But observing how economies cycle through out history, I'm definitely not discounting it.  

One possibility is fairly obvious to me at this point. If China continues its aggressive currency devaluation, distorting international trade in the process, other susceptible economies may be forced to respond in kind to try to maintain their foreign trade competitiveness. If this sparks a currency war race to the bottom, I could easily imagine sudden inflation in many, if not all, markets.",2015-08-13 15:31:16+00:00,cu1noet,6.0,t1_cu1m04a,2717.0,Bitcoin

As a master market manipulator, I think China as a nation has chosen a very opportune time for this action. It should boost their export industries, provide a spark to the economy and effectively reduce the effect of RMB denominated debt in one stroke. It also serves as another lever for them in trying to counter their imploding stock market.

I think where you had 2 in your equation compared to e (~2.718281) somehow arose from the symmetric/asymmetric issue, but it's beyond me to prove this.  

So check my math. Taking my original incorrectly remembered time of 2 hours and 40 minutes and 369,365 blocks, we would expect to see ~0.04 instances of a block time that long or more. Pretty unlikely.  

Taking the 2 hour and 9 minute value, we'd expect to see ~0.923 instances, much more possible. As you mentioned, it's like the real interval was less due to clock inaccuracies at the miners, but exactly how much I haven't been able to document.

2686,"OK, I've read the entire document and here's my take:  

TL;DR: This is a long document filled with marketing fluff, vague assertions, double-speak, and far too much outright BS. There is essentially *no ""there"" there*, and it's almost entirely devoid of substance. No clear or detailed explanation of how any degree of a permissioned ledger can be trusted, verified or determined to be indisputable by any of its participants is supplied, and definitely no justification for requiring the extensive overhead of a block chain based system is explained when no clear returns over existing technologies are on offer.  

----  

If one makes an innovative and new assertion: that a permissioned block chain can be used in a verifiable and indisputable way, I believe the claimant should clearly establish their case. Hopefully, something akin to the clarity in Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper. I could not find anything close to that in this text, nor any reference to where such a document could be found.  

Instead, it spends time re-branding things like ""mining"" as ""committing"", and cryptocurrency tokens as ""junk"". Multiple paragraphs are spent explaining why the benefits of permissionless block chains and distributed systems are not only negligible or unimportant, but making the extraordinary assertion that they may in fact be *undesirable*. Wut?  

In particular, the entire section on ""Examining Trustlessness"" is disingenuous to an extreme. Remarkable effort is expended trying to convince the reader that existing legacy systems and safeguards (such as costly banking insurance) render trustlessness redundant, completely ignoring the fact that trustlessness has the potential to remove or minimize the need for such costly bureaucracies in the first place. It goes so far as to fault Bitcoin for trusting ""... the manufacturers of their computers and operating systems on which they run the Bitcoin client...,"" never explaining how Eris plans to improve upon this issue. If no improvement is possible from Eris, why even raise the point?  

Trustless systems are further faulted for being irreversible, ignoring existing and developing solutions using multisig and smart contract capability. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the same document, they boast of eris:db's sophisticated design based on the same smart contract technology previously glossed over while critiquing trustlessness. When trustless systems are described as rigid and impractical to modify, the inflexibilty of a launched eris:db block chain is painted as robust and dependable. Elsewhere, they ignore the fact that consensus change can and does take place in trustless systems, but play up the easily changeable and flexible nature of eris:db. So are eris:db block chains robust and dependable, or easily changeable and flexible? I sense a contradiction here. In addition, who can be trusted to make such changes and why this trust should exist is also completely ignored.  

Upon reaching the end of the document, I asked myself, ""OK, if I accept their arguments that all the advantages and innovation brought by trustless decentralized systems are not really significant pluses, what exactly does their permissioned block chain concept then bring?"" Using block chains **is really the long way around** in accomplishing a goal. If it does not bring actual, recognizable advantages, implementing one is simply wasting effort and introducing unnecessary complexity. I could find almost nothing in this entire text that addresses this conundrum.  

The one innovation that I think I took away is that if eris:db works as promised, it could be a single client that could work with a vast multitude of differently configured block chains. However, if they can't concisely show how any one block chain on this spectrum from almost trustless to highly permissioned can *actually* achieve their claims, I can't say I see the utility in such an innovation.  

I'm not averse to experimentation with these kind of permissioned block chains, however Eris and others in this space are clearly touting them as finished, revolutionary products. This strikes me as egregious over promising. If the utility of a new idea has not ever been demonstrated or even clearly explained, I much prefer an under-sell, with an objective eye on possible points of failure.  

I hope you also read this document in detail, and I'm very open to being shown that I misread some or all of it, or that I've just gone completely off the deep end. At this point I have to say I'm very skeptical of Eris as a company, and that my overall suspicions about any permissioned block chain organization have only been strengthened.

2691,"I'm not one to contend all developments upon block chains must be upon the Bitcoin block chain. But I am not convinced that there is any clear benefit to building on a *permissioned* block chain. I disagree that the article you linked makes a clear explanation. Many claims in early paragraphs do seem to apply to permissionless block chains, but the article then transitions into claims that permissioned block chains *may* be able to accomplish the same things without ever explaining exactly how this can be accomplished. In fact, the author seems to acknowledge this contradiction:  

&gt; The bigger issue is whether such a model of permissioned and centralized blockchains can still fulfill bitcoin supporters’ grand, Utopian vision of a technology to empower individuals and break down monopoly power.  

If you can find or provide a lucid explanation of how a permissioned block chain can be trusted by all participants as it:  

&gt; ... can be programmed to manage relationships between different units within an organization and thus achieve levels of ""data-driven integration"" that were previously impossible....,  

(a claim attributed by your linked article to Byrne), I'd love to see it. The article then mentions such a block chain is ""verifiable, indisputable"", but again does not explain how all users of a permissioned ledger can trust such claims.  

On a permissioned block chain, all users, some that may have different levels of access than others, must agree that records in the ledger are indisputable and verifiable. This can only happen if all participants trust those that have the ability to add blocks or fork the chain. If that is the starting point, then why not just give the agreed upon participants write and/or edit ability in a commonly accessible database? The problem is, history has shown that independent business and government entities *do not trust each other in this way*.  

To me it seems self-evident that a permissionless block chain can accomplish these ends, as all users could independently verify the ledger without needing to trust *any* of the other participants. Any permissionless block chain could support this. It just so happens that the current such block chain that is the most secure and widely used belongs to Bitcoin.

2708,"&gt; ... if I earned a few bucks a day without much wear and tear on my machine, and learned something in the process...

You won't be earning a few bucks a day in Bitcoin without ASICs unless you already have a warehouse full of the latest GPUs available (in which case why don't you sell your extra hardware for profit instead). The key to getting any return at all (I'm talking on the order of pennies per day or less) would be essentially free electricity and minimizing any hardware costs. I'm pretty sure with the best current GPUs you can find some shares (which are the minimum units that show some work was done) at mining pools, but I have no idea how long it would take you to reach a minimum withdrawal amount (assuming its doable at all).  

&gt; I don't see how that wouldn't benefit me, and that's pretty much where I'm coming from. You think I should look into a used ASIC?  

Unless you've got some pretty powerful GPUs laying around, you might need to start with a cheap ASIC to see anything actually happen at all (i.e. finding a significant number of shares). But remember, even with free electricity, you might never recoup the cost of even a $3 USB ASIC in your lifetime since difficulty just seems to keep increasing.  

Anyone serious about trying to make a profit mining these days would need to start with one or more serious ASICs, like this:  

http://www.ebay.com/itm/Bitmain-Antminer-S5-Asic-Bitcoin-Miner-SHA256-1155-GH-/271949088938?hash=item3f516dc8aa

along with the needed power supplies, a place with enough cooling and that's tolerant of the resulting fan noise, and of course, free or nearly free electricity for the 3-9 months that it'll take to break even (**if** that's even possible). And there are uncertainties like possible big increases in hashing technology that could happen between now and break even that could derail the chance to make a profit entirely. Another approach would be just mine as long as you think you're profitable, and then try to sell your equipment to recoup costs when you think you're falling behind the curve. A bankroll of $1,000 to $2,000 is probably minimum to start such an effort, plus you should really know what you're doing, and that it still would be a gamble.  

No matter how you approach it, it's a really tough proposition now. That's why I emphasize the hobby aspect. If you just want to learn the process and don't mind spending say $20 to $50 a month, you can learn all the ins and outs. If you get comfortable with the process, you could then re-evaluate if you want to make a big investment and try to make a profit (an effort that would be risky and is guaranteed to take a lot of time).  

Some two or more years ago, the chance to make a profit mining was much higher. These days, if you think the value of bitcoin will appreciate you should really consider just buying some, or exchanging goods or services for some. Otherwise, you better enjoy the mining process itself, because there's a very good chance that's all you'll get out of it, and the whole adventure could net cost you some money in the end.",2015-08-06 04:58:25+00:00,ctt9823,5.0,t1_ctt84vw,2455.0,Bitcoin

https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/calculator

Make sure you use realistic estimates of the difficulty increase over the period you'll be trying to recoup your costs. I'd recommend **never** buying mining hardware in a pre-sale, as that has gone wrong in too many cases.

One point you may want to keep in mind: after any such hard fork, those who held tokens before the split would have the same amount of tokens on both branches immediately following the fork. Presuming both branches exist long enough for a market to develop, whichever branches is seen to offer more value and utility will quickly induce holders of tokens on the opposing branch to exchange them for something else (quite likely tokens on the more successful branch). This positive feedback loop would quickly drive the value of the tokens on the losing branch down.

Each can eventually represent that subscriber's views on Bitcoin by choosing different code to run. Each has a chunk of DO's data center bandwidth, so additional nodes add to overall Bitcoin network capability (with respect to throttling by DO, of course it can't add overall bandwidth beyond DO's maximum capability -- I would expect them to add to their total bandwidth as their subscriber base grows).

Unfortunately, several mining pools which collectively had &gt;51% of the global hash rate reported accepting the soft fork ~~*but did not follow through by adhering to the rules of the soft fork*~~ *but proceeded to use SPV mining that did not validate previous blocks before mining futher*. Hence, they mined new blocks atop an invalid block. At one point the invalid chain was as much as six blocks longer than the valid chain. There have been no reports of users' funds affected. So far only the mining pools that accepted BIP66 but did not follow its rules, and perhaps mining pools running on old pre-0.9.5 nodes, have lost rewards.

Miners only represent one part of the overall system the provides functionality and hence value in Bitcoin. Non-mining nodes, merchants, SPV wallets, off-chain service providers, and parties that own bitcoin represent the other parts. Should a large majority of miners decide to hard fork to increase miner rewards, those that object to this move could simply stay on the original fork. From this point forward, the vast majority of SHA256 hashing power that is now on the miners' increased rewards fork would only affect policy there.

Loss of bitcoin is something that will always occur, and as you've pointed out the reduction of total supply will tend to make remaining bitcoins more valuable. This is why Bitcoin is considered *deflationary*.

2863,"&gt; ... according your computer's power and your time in program you start to get less and less Bitcoin...  

Here it sounds like you're referring to mining, but you should understand that mining is not required for people to use Bitcoin. In fact, it's now exceedingly difficult for individuals to mine profitably.  

These days getting and using bitcoin the digital asset is the same as getting and using cash. You can exchange another form of currency for it, or you can provide goods or services for it.

&gt; ... it's all connected to a kinda mainstream which controls the bitcoin outcome so we have control on outcome...  

If by this you mean that using Bitcoin entails connecting to some central organization, computer, or service, that's not the case. Using Bitcoin means utilizing a decentralized network. The user can choose how much they want to participate in the network (more participation means more decentralized use), but using Bitcoin directly means never being *required* to depend on any centralized agency.  

&gt; aaaaand we think it's precious because it's not common around the world and we give it a value etc.
also There's a huge campaign/Lobby that supports Bitcoin which to give it some value to show like it is precious thing(claim it's precious until it is actually precious)  

&gt; That's all cool..  

&gt; You would argue big corporates and companies supporting it like yahoo or other travel pages but it looks like they look like they in it just in case, you know to get a piece of it..  

Whether bitcoin is precious or not is in the eye of the beholder. What the algorithm guarantees for as long as Bitcoin exists is true and verifiable *scarcity*.  

I'd dispute that there's a huge campaign or lobby for Bitcoin. Bitcoin and its community are still tiny in the overall scheme of things. There's really no PR budget for it to speak of. However, large organizations are starting to realize the platform for innovation that Bitcoin represents. Venture capital is entering the space at an accelerating rate. The small community that does exist around it is generally composed of people that really believe in it and so are ardent activists. The combination of these factors seems to be finally raising Bitcoin's profile.  

&gt; What else advantage Bitcoin has I can't see  

This is actually a big subject. The advantages you've touched on so far are only part of Bitcoin's primary function as a digital asset/digital currency/store of value/payment network. You didn't mention that it's also borderless, very highly available (no banker's hours, holidays or weekends off), quite reliable, censorship and seizure resistant, highly secure (when used properly), does not expose private details through its use, potentially universal as opposed to being tied to nation-states, impossible to counterfeit/self-verifying, and can be highly transparent or virtually anonymous depending on how it's employed. It's also *programmable*.  

And that leads in to the next big advantage of Bitcoin, that it's not just limited to this first application as a digital asset/payment network. It's also the world's first method for achieving consensus across a distributed network composed of nodes you don't need to trust. This means it can be open to everyone and serve as a platform for permission-less innovation. Where this may eventually lead is difficult to fully imagine at this point. [This site has just one list of potential applications](http://ledracapital.com/blog/2014/3/11/bitcoin-series-24-the-mega-master-blockchain-list). And [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU) explains Bitcoin's potential well.  

&gt; why they think greece should change it's national money to Bitcoin, country in debt and thing what will change if they change to it. they ll become rich and debtless in one night?  

In the context of Greece, Bitcoin can help people avoid bank collapses, ensure access to their funds, and avoid government bail-ins and capital controls. There's also the theory that a government using a currency immune to arbitrary money supply inflation (currency printing/quantitative easing) would be less prone to severe boom-and-bust economic cycles and less able to incur mountains of unsustainable debt.  

&gt; what can an invester do? except buying some bitcoin and keeping on the side aand praying to bitcoin get a higher value (and making lobby LOL)  

As Bitcoin itself is still new, companies in the Bitcoin space are typically quite young and still privately held. As a result, the average investor can't invest directly in Bitcoin-related companies so far. This should be changing pretty quickly in coming years.  

Meanwhile, if you study Bitcoin and come to believe in its potential, price discovery of bitcoin as a digital asset is still occurring. So in that sense, you're correct that buying and holding bitcoin right now is the most direct way to invest in the technology. Ironically, bitcoin the unit won't completely fulfill it's potential as a digital asset until it's much more mature, and price discovery is essentially complete. Only then will volatility be dramatically reduced. At that point bitcoin could very well have better monetary characteristics than conventional alternatives, but buying and holding it as an investment with high growth potential may not make much sense. Still, if it is still around, companies doing Bitcoin-related business would be more established and likely have shares publicly available on stock exchanges, etc. Then Bitcoin-related investment opportunities would be plentiful.  

&gt; Explain it to me why it's currency of future or is it another thing to make some people rich  

Bitcoin could be both, but it's early days yet. Purchasing and holding bitcoin should be viewed as a high risk investment, so the often used cliche still holds: best not to invest more than you can afford to lose.  

Aside from investing directly in Bitcoin, everyone can still avail themselves of its usefulness. Exchanging fiat currency for bitcoin and then utilizing it quickly can minimize exposure to volatility. Alternatively, businesses are offering more and more options everyday that leverage Bitcoin's advantages. Many such services should be significantly cheaper than conventional alternatives, or be available in regions that were formerly unserved.  

Even better yet, you could learn how to develop with and for Bitcoin, and create your own beneficial service at essentially no cost to you aside from your invested time. No one is obligated to use Bitcoin, but it is openly available to all that find it useful.",2015-06-18 14:43:02+00:00,csaq3ve,1.0,t3_3a9vwr,11722.0,Bitcoin

It seems unrealistic to me that this could effectively prevent a fork if hashrates of the two camps are of a similar order of magnitude.",2015-06-18 02:21:46+00:00,csa9z9m,19.0,t1_csa96fx,1540.0,Bitcoin

That miners can switch which fork they mine on is a good thing. They'll likely follow profitability, so whichever fork demonstrates more value in the market will attract more miners. Even if that ends up being the small block fork, at least the hard fork will have demonstrated that's where true *market* consensus is.",2015-06-18 02:04:11+00:00,csa9fd5,25.0,t1_csa8yy0,896.0,Bitcoin

In such a case, the large block chain doesn't have anything near consensus to begin with. Otherwise, if the two camps have hash power of relatively the same magnitude, once enough blocks get built on top of a large block with the correct version, orphaning is no longer an issue.

I think one or more of the 7 mempools that did have your transaction was a mining pool that had some significant hashrate (or perhaps your transaction was in some mempools not polled by BlockCypher).  

I believe re-pushing is the same as rebroadcasting. Previously I didn't realize you'd sent from Armory, but I also understand that it does rebroadcast on its own (though I don't know the time intervals).

Several things from that transaction are still mysterious to me. I don't know why it was only in 7 mempools, or why re-pushing/rebroadcasting didn't show the normal pattern of propagation across mempools in BlockCypher. Also, when I looked in on the transaction, BlockCypher listed it as ""Low"" under ""Miner Preference"", but BC.i showed its Estimated Confirmation Time as ""Very Soon"" (High Priority).
