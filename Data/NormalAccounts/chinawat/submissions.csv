However, I've heard that its added complexity leads to poorer scaling (compared to Bitcoin without the 1 MB block size limit, of course), and significantly higher computational demands for transaction/block validation. I've also heard that light or SPV clients don't currently exist and that achieving them for Monero may be difficult or impossible. There even was a short-lived thread on that other Bitcoin sub about how these issues would quickly become real-world limitations should Monero experience significant transaction growth (I can no longer find that thread, it was likely deleted by /r/Bitcoin mods eventually). Lastly, I wonder if Lightning or a similar near-ready scaling solution is possible on Monero?",btc,There seems to be a lot of Monero (XMR) cheerleading in /r/btc lately.

Welcome to Reddit!  

&gt; Many seem to think that a blocksize increase is a minor technical change with few if any adverse effects.  

If this belief is incorrect, it should be discussed openly and with technical specifics. Core has shown that it is pathologically unwilling to do this. I notice you don't list arguments against this contention.  

&gt; Many seem to think that a hardfork is simple and easy for everyone (what's easy for you might be much harder for a large business).  

Again, specifics, please. Why would raising or removing the block size limit be harder for a large business than, say, SegWit or LN?  

&gt; Many seem to think that full blocks are the end of the world (even though blocks will fill at any size depending on the cost).  

Purposefully operating Bitcoin at an artificially maintained block size limit *economically alters* the system from how it has proved itself over 6.5 years. In fact, it even changes the original intent of that system. The fact is, there already are countering economic pressures which limit real block sizes that only get relieved as technology advances. A fixed limit does not even allow for the normal progress afforded by such technical advances.  

Worse, Bitcoin's first-mover advantage is finite, and there is a growing universe of **non-block size limited** altcoins out there. Bitcoin may have a faction choosing to hamstring it, but I can assure you, others will not choose to do the same.  

&gt; Many fail to see the benefits of segwit and the potential of payment channels (instant transactions are a great start).  

This is a complete red herring. SegWit and payment channels will work just as well (better in the case of LN) with increased block headroom. Raising the block size limit and scaling innovations are essentially orthogonal.  

&gt; And many have just decided that they hate everyone who contributes to Bitcoin Core.  

I do hate tacit support of censorship. I hate indifference to conflict of interest, particularly indifference to the colossal appearance of such that Blockstream casts over Core and by extension Bitcoin. I hate stalling and the refusal of open discussion. I hate that forthright, long-time supporters of Bitcoin such as Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik get abused and ostracized by an insular clique. I hate disingenuous speech and deceitful actions. I hate word-mincing and hairsplitting. I hate the perhaps not-so-tacit support of DDoS'ing and Sybil attacks on alternative clients. I hate, closed, backdoor meetings purportedly on behalf of an open, permissionless system. And I hate the fact that there are those who won't even hold up their agreements made in such meetings.  

In spite of my personal feelings, I'd be happy for anyone, even those prone to the above actions to contribute to Bitcoin, so long as they have no out-sized control or influence over the community. This is Bitcoin after all. Shouldn't we all strive for decentralization in all things. Let's have some in Bitcoin development.  

&gt; It really is unfortunate that this has been ongoing for as long as it has.  

At last, something to agree on.  

&gt; The approaching deployment of segwit...  

Is it April already?  

&gt; ... and the subsequent potential for payment channel technologies to break onto the scene should be huge cause for excitement; yet instead we're still fighting the ""but 2MB hardfork"" line.  

If we were to do a simple and conservative block size limit increase, quickly and with as little drama as was just demonstrated by the successful Ethereum hard fork, it would go a long ways towards healing this massive rift in the Bitcoin community sparked by /u/theymos' instituting censorship in this subreddit. We could then get the entire community pulling forwards towards scaling innovation and other growth of Bitcoin.

Again, specifics, please. Why would raising or removing the block size limit be harder for a large business than, say, SegWit or LN?  

&gt; Many seem to think that full blocks are the end of the world (even though blocks will fill at any size depending on the cost).  

Purposefully operating Bitcoin at an artificially maintained block size limit *economically alters* the system from how it has proved itself over 6.5 years. In fact, it even changes the original intent of that system. The fact is, there already are countering economic pressures which limit real block sizes that only get relieved as technology advances. A fixed limit does not even allow for the normal progress afforded by such technical advances.  

Worse, Bitcoin's first-mover advantage is finite, and there is a growing universe of **non-block size limited** altcoins out there. Bitcoin may have a faction choosing to hamstring it, but I can assure you, others will not choose to do the same.  

&gt; Many fail to see the benefits of segwit and the potential of payment channels (instant transactions are a great start).  

This is a complete red herring. SegWit and payment channels will work just as well (better in the case of LN) with increased block headroom. Raising the block size limit and scaling innovations are essentially orthogonal.  

&gt; And many have just decided that they hate everyone who contributes to Bitcoin Core.  

I do hate tacit support of censorship. I hate indifference to conflict of interest, particularly indifference to the colossal appearance of such that Blockstream casts over Core and by extension Bitcoin. I hate stalling and the refusal of open discussion. I hate that forthright, long-time supporters of Bitcoin such as Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik get abused and ostracized by an insular clique. I hate disingenuous speech and deceitful actions. I hate word-mincing and hairsplitting. I hate the perhaps not-so-tacit support of DDoS'ing and Sybil attacks on alternative clients. I hate, closed, backdoor meetings purportedly on behalf of an open, permissionless system. And I hate the fact that there are those who won't even hold up their agreements made in such meetings.  

In spite of my personal feelings, I'd be happy for anyone, even those prone to the above actions to contribute to Bitcoin, so long as they have no out-sized control or influence over the community. This is Bitcoin after all. Shouldn't we all strive for decentralization in all things. Let's have some in Bitcoin development.  

&gt; It really is unfortunate that this has been ongoing for as long as it has.  

At last, something to agree on.  

&gt; The approaching deployment of segwit...  

Is it April already?  

&gt; ... and the subsequent potential for payment channel technologies to break onto the scene should be huge cause for excitement; yet instead we're still fighting the ""but 2MB hardfork"" line.  

If we were to do a simple and conservative block size limit increase, quickly and with as little drama as was just demonstrated by the successful Ethereum hard fork, it would go a long ways towards healing this massive rift in the Bitcoin community sparked by /u/theymos' instituting censorship in this subreddit. We could then get the entire community pulling forwards towards scaling innovation and other growth of Bitcoin.

After much reflection, examination of the LN Youtube presentation, and after substantial useful dialogue with the commenters in this thread (thanks to all those who replied), I've come to realize my original fears about this are probably overblown. I now believe that when used for microtransactions, the ability for either party to do something that would force the other to collapse the channel early is extremely limited. In effect, the attack surface is exceedingly small, so much so that I no longer think higher transaction fees would lead to an amplifying or multiplying effect on the advantage LN on altcoins would have over LN on Bitcoin.  

The comparatively high transaction fees of Bitcoin still add friction to the system. They still make choosing to collapse a channel early more costly, and they still would incentivize longer nLockTimes, effectively adding cost in terms of the time value of money. These are advantages LN on altcoins would still have, but at least as far as microtransactions over an existing LN channel, Bitcoin does not seem to be at much, if any, of a disadvantage.  

I'm more than willing to re-evaluate and see if I'm wrong yet again if anyone has new input, but I feel much more comfortable with how LN works now, and I think I can make a good case as to why my original conclusions were in error.  

--- Original post starts here ---

Don't know why I didn't realize this before: please check my thinking on this.  

LN gets its ""trustlessness"" from being able to collapse a channel at any time to ""recover"" funds (and there is still a time lock to contend with after you close a channel this way). LN is intended to facilitate micrtransactions. But if fees on the base layer are so high, mid-path hubs will be able to effectively cheat on low value transactions with impunity because the channel end-points will be reluctant to pay a huge fee to close and re-open a channel just to recover a small loss. This means LN is effectively hamstrung when run on a high-fee base settlement layer.  

Now here's the key point: **LN can be pretty much copypasta'd onto any altcoin, and they have low fees**. This means LN can fulfill its promise **on any other coin BUT Bitcoin**.

Nice plan, Core.  

EDIT: Looked at another way, having Lightning Network available *increases the competitive advantage altcoins have over Bitcoin on the Core road map*.  

EDIT 2: Yet another perspective: LN is an amplification of the competitive advantage altcoins get due to Bitcoin's self-imposed 1 MB block size limit.  

EDIT 3: To make sure I'm talking out of my ass as little as possible, I looked over this video again that I link here for your reference:
