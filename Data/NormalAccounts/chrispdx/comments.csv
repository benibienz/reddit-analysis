She's fully justified in withholding sex from a relationship until she feels comfortable enough or committed enough.

And offer tax incentives to refit existing buildings. Yes, there will be more opportunity for illegal activity in them, but so what?

I had the same argument with my son when, at age 17, he bought a baby tortoise. I told him that this was a life-long commitment, and that he needed to consider the fact that this creature was going to accompany him through all the stages of his life (marriage, moving, changes in lifestyle, etc.) and that he would have to make accommodations as such. He didn't listen to me. He bought it, it grew to full size, and it got ""too hard"" to take care of, and he dumped it off on one of his friends.

What's worse in my opinion is that he DOESN'T CARE that he doesn't make you happy, and seems completely unwilling or unable to admit that he is at least part of the cause of your unhappiness. This to me smacks of narcissism. I would like to tell you that it may get better but it probably won't. Good luck to you.

I really want to sympathize with you, but in my opinion you were complicit with creating the current situation. Sexual compatibility is an essential part of knowing if you want to commit your life to someone else, and you chose to stick your head in the sand and just ""hope"" everything turned out well. Well, it didn't. A major Red Flag was intentionally ignored by you when you were dating, and now you've dealt with the consequences for four years. You married a man with little to no sex drive (at least towards you). That is a fact. You've tried to change him fruitlessly and now you are blaming him for being someone he's not and wasn't going to be, but you chose to ignore it.

1320,"Choosing Palin as VP was a Hail Mary attempt at the Presidency. It was the maybe the ultimate ""High Risk, High Reward"" gamble in American political history. 

McCain was trending downward against Obama in August of 2008, and most pundits knew that it was Obama's election to lose. McCain needed a boost with women, evangelicals, and a counter to Obama's image as a ""political outsider"". It was also thought that her being a woman would deflect some of the negative aspects of the ticket in the media, as Obama being black had done as well. Palin's record in Alaska was positive enough to take the risk.

[For a brief time, in early September of 2008, IT WORKED. McCain caught up with Obama and actually took a 3 point lead in the polls that lasted for a few weeks. Until Palin started talking.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/general_election_mccain_vs_obama-225.html#chart)

Of course, we all know what a shitshow it turned out to be, but if McCain had played it somewhat safe and chosen one of the other candidates (Lieberman [*who, in reality, might have been an EXCELLENT choice and could have swung a serious number of Democrats and Independents*], Romney, Pawlenty), he wouldn't have generated near the buzz and probably would have gone down to a relatively quiet close loss similar to John Kerry.",2016-05-18 20:49:35+00:00,d3aqctt,7.0,t1_d3amv7k,4207.0,gifs
1321,"It was called running for President and appealing to the nutjob fringe of the GOP party. He didn't have a choice. The video in question COST McCain untold numbers of votes because he didn't toe the line that Obama was a dark-skinned Kenyan Muslim Arab Manchurian Candidate that was going to lead to the destruction of the country as White People knew it. It was a view that McCain ultimately couldn't swallow.

In reality, McCain was in a no-win situation. If he had run as his 2000 ""Maverick Centrist"" personna, he would have alienated the wingnut racists of the GOP that had been courted since the 60s, been vulnerable in the South which he NEEDED to have a chance. If he went full-on ""Anti-Nigger"" to appease the wingnuts, he would have destroyed his chance with anyone outside of the White South. McCain tried to toe the line and appeal to both, but found out that was impossible. Eight years later, that schism in the GOP is poised to rip the party in two.",2016-05-18 20:33:59+00:00,d3apl3p,9.0,t1_d3ansdo,2180.0,gifs

Effort is what it's all about. The Blazers, for 9 of the last 12 quarters with the Warriors, have out-worked and out-hustled the champs, and save one of those three quarters that was an utter meltdown by a young squad, they'd be up 2-1 in this series.

Steph Curry is the wildcard, to be sure, but even the hardest Dubs fan can't expect him to come back after 2+ weeks off, still nursing an injury, and be instant MVP.

If the Blazers shoot 50% plus and 35% plus from the 3-point line, there's no way they lose this game regardless of what the Warriors do.

If it was established that the women leads had some connection to the original two movies, like Sigourney Weaver avenging the death of Peter Venkman, Igon Spangler, and her son by some Ecto-Demon and with the help of Ray and Winston assembling a female Ghostbusters crew that kicked ass and took names with Dana at the helm and Ray/Winston back at Ghostbusters central, **I WOULD WATCH THE FUCK OUT OF THAT MOVIE**.

Trump, for all his faults and weaknesses, played by the rules and won elections. He's going to have the votes to be the GOP nominee, and if that's taken away from him, all hell is going to break loose.

Honestly, what's going on on the other side of the coin with Hillary and Sanders is pretty much the same. In 2008, only Obama's overwhelming charisma and hypnotic speaking style wrested the nomination from Hillary, and there were PLENTY of pissed-off Democrats in the process. Sanders doesn't have anything close to this ability, so he's getting shoved aside regardless of the grass-roots support he's gathered. The media has already pretty much written him off, so why should Democrats in states that haven't voted in their primaries even bother?

But after the tragedy of Apollo 1, the entire world watched in awe as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon.

To invade Europe Proper, the US and whatever forces were left from Britain and France would have had to have fought exclusively up through North Africa, through Russia alongside Russian forces, or perhaps through a non-neutral Spain. I doubt that Roosevelt could have managed the domestic support for something like that, instead focusing all efforts on defeating Japan, which probably would have taken about the same amount of time, causing America's entry into the European theater to be severely delayed if at all... allowing Germany's Rocket and Nuclear programs to proceed unimpeded.

2386,"Oregon QB situation is troubling. Vernon Adams was a one-year band-aid to the fact that the Ducks didn't have a suitable replacement for Mariota. Jeff Lockie was a disaster, I don't think he'll get another opportunity, and the walk-on Taylor Alie wasn't much better, but then again, he wasn't expected to be.

The future is a group of highly-touted but ultimately unknown quantities. Morgan Mahalak really doesn't have the pedigree to take over a program like Oregon, he seems more suited for a Lockie role as a backup. Travis Jonsen came in with a 4 star rating but almost immediately had a season-ending injury so all that practice squad time is lost. He'll redshirt, which is a solace, but he won't be ready to come right in next year and produce unless he blows people away during the spring.

The Oregon coaches seem to realize this, since they've talked with Robert Mitchell, a JC QB out of Texas with a 4.4 40 yd, as a possible plug-in until either Jonsen or Ryan Kelly is ready to take the reigns. But it's all up in the air.

The defense will be okay. This year they are VERY VERY young and seem to be getting better every week.

2516,"Story Time: Back in the 90s I had a long distance relationship with a young white woman from Ada, Oklahoma for about a year and a half. One of those early-internet chat-based relationships where you swore you were deeply in love with someone you've hardly spent any time with, if at all. We visited each other's homes a few times before we broke up, or more correctly, said ""fuck this distance bullshit"".

Anyway, on my first trip down to see her, her family threw a BBQ, not specifically for me, but I was one of the main reasons. Her family was my stereotypical vision of Southern Rednecks: Confederate Flags, Gun Racks, Pickup Trucks, ripped blue jeans, wife-beater t-shirts, the works. I'm this liberal West Coast fish-out-of-water feeling completely out of place, but I'm acting nice because my GF really wants her family to like me. Anyway, as I am schmoozing, I notice that all the women including my GF have moved to the kitchen, and all the men are in the living room sitting and bullshitting. So I excuse myself, get up, and go into the kitchen to ask if there's anything I can do to help. All the women look at me like I'm an alien with four fucking dicks and mumble that they are okay, and my GF embarrasedly shoos me from the kitchen back to the living room. Well, okay, when in Rome, I guess.

A little while longer, we hear ""Food's Ready!!!"" from the kitchen. No one moves. No one even acknowledges. I get off my ass and go into the kitchen and kiss my GF and start making my plate and tell her to go sit down and I'll bring her some. I swear you could have heard a pin drop. My GF was beet red and snatched the plate from me and whispered ""Please Chris, GO.... SIT.... DOWN!"". I sheepishly walked out and back in the living room all the guys were looking at me with a slightly pissed-off look, as if I just insulted their manhood. I didn't really give a fuck about them, but did care about my GF's feelings, so I sat by myself and waited for her to bring the food (which was fucking delicious, as I remember).

After we were done eating, I took my GF's plate from her and started gathering other dishes and said to everyone ""Well, guys, let's let the girls rest after cooking this great meal. Who'se helping me with the dishes?"" Fucking audible gasps. No one moved. At this point, I was done caring. I took the dishes that I had in my hand into the kitchen and starting cleaning pots and pans. I heard a little commotion in the living room, and then my GF's mom came into the kitchen and asked me what I was doing. I said ""Ma'am, where I was raised, whoever eats the food does the dishes, and that's my way of saying thanks."" She didn't say a word, smiled briefly, and walked out. After I had done the pots and pans, my GF grabbed me from behind and took me to a side house where we fucked for like hours, probably just to keep me away from her family.

We broke up soon after I got back. Go figure.

This led to ""stagflation"" and high unemployment. Unemployment finally reached 9% in May of 1975. (For more on this see, Stagflation, 1970s Style.)

And Jimmy Carter was blamed for it, when in fact his administration did Yeoman's Work building back up the economy in the late 70s, despite the high inflation... people's wages and earning power were raising to match.

The truth is that Jordan would have probably bolted to a large market team at his first opportunity... probably the Lakers or the Rockets. Portland would have been screwed with no Drexler and none of the cohesive core that contended for titles in 90 and 92.

Best case, Ramsay and Glickman realize the potential of Jordan early, package Drexler, Paxson, and Audie Norris for a proven center like Jack Sikma, Tree Rollins, or even Moses Malone. Granted that they drafted Porter the following year, they have a lineup of Porter, Jordan, Vandeweghe, Mychal Thompson, and whichever center they traded for.

Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know how you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know... was our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent. Huh huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like ol' squares in battle like a, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark comes to the nearest man and that man, he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got...lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces.
Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, boson's mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He's a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945.

LaMarcus left 28 million dollars on the table to go to the Spurs. Let that sink in.... 28 million dollars to not stay in Portland. That in itself speaks volumes to the state of the Blazers and the chances for small-market teams. I've watched Clyde, Rasheed, hell, even Walton, leave for ""greener pastures"" and won titles with other teams while the Blazers are in perpetual rebuilding mode. Rebuilding for what? To get to the 2nd round? To MAYBE once in a blue moon make the conference finals or the Finals and get beaten by a large-market team with better talent because they can keep their big-time players and the Blazers can't?

They locked up Lillard though! So what? In five years, he will spurn another extension and test the free market. And he'll find a better team to go to and win his title(s) there. I have heard that record over and over and over in the 40+ years I've been a Blazer fan, I can damn near sing it from memory.

But guess what? Next year I'll convince myself that the Blazers will have a chance... that rooting for Lillard and whatever warm bodies they put in Blazers' gear to ""fly under the radar"" and be a contender.
