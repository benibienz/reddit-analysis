Ride was decent, $13 or so, one of those meat-and-potatoes rides on a weekday evening. Guy was pleasant enough conversationally.

Next rider discovered entrepreneur's iPhone in the back seat. I took it, plugged in into my charger, and submitted a ""found item"" report to Uber. They got back to me quickly with ""can we relay your contact info to rider"" permission request. This has happened a few times in the past and its resulted in a fairly nice tip for a finder's fee, so yeah, sure.

I do some reverse Google snooping and found the guys name, business, address, etc. based upon what he told me during our conversation. He got a hold of me and was thankful it was found, he was freaking out since he had loads of business contacts that weren't stored anywhere else. I live a good half-hour away from his business, so I told him that my wife would bring it down to him today, and he could give my wife whatever he felt was appropriate for her time and gas. Every time in the past, this has been mutually beneficial to all parties.

She arrives and meets with him, he takes the phone from her, whispers thanks while turning and walking to the back of his business, and disappears with no other interaction. My wife kind of stands there, a little unsure of what to do for about 5 minutes until one of the other employees walks up to her and asks if she needs anything. She left, not just a little angry and humiliated.

If I had suspected this guy was going to be a major league douchenozzle about it, I would have told him that I'd drop it off at the Greenlight center ""at my next opportunity"" or otherwise just make his life hell trying to get his phone back. Such utter bullshit. The thing is, this guy has like a serious local online presence about his ""business acumen"" and ""humanitarian ethics and sustainability in business"". Part of me wants to blow this guy up on his blogs and social media saying what a fucking cheapskate asshole he was towards someone who was going out of their way to bail his drunk ass out.

Most are nice, pleasant, chatty. Some just chat with each other and leave the driving to me. That's cool, I don't mind just being ""the driver"".

However, man, there's some stuff that gets said in my car during those types of trips that makes me bite my tongue so hard it bleeds. Last night was one of those trips.

Picked up a young couple from a movie theater. Young woman was VERY attractive, young guy, not so much. Made some small talk at first, asked what they saw. Was expecting standard ""Dr. Strange"", ""Arrival""... nope. [They saw a (taped earlier) live streamed broadcast of a London stage performance of ""Hamlet"" with Benedict Cumberbatch.] (http://ntlive.nationaltheatre.org.uk/productions/ntlout18-hamlet) Hey that's awesome, I said. The girl said ""Meh, I'd seen better"". Ookay, then. Then the couple started talking to each other.

Both kids were Sophomores at [Reed College](http://www.reed.edu/) in Portland. It's a small liberal-arts college that's been called ""The Harvard Of The West"". It's very exclusive and prestigious, very expensive, and the students are very, very smart. I have had many very interesting conversations over my time being an Uber driver with students from there.

The topic they were discussing were the recent protests/riots in Portland in response to the election. The girl (who later said she was a double pre-law/gender studies major, and a lesbian) praised the riot/destruction parts of the protests as ""a sharp blow to the institutional patriarchy and misogyny that permeates from every aspect of society"", and that ""Reed's efforts to (tone down and manage) ""control"" its student's participation will just piss everyone off and they'll just quit school"". She then said ""Harvard was my second choice behind Reed, I'll just pack up and go there"".

What REALLY made me bite my tongue was her friend's statement: ""Sometimes I'm ashamed to have a penis."" and her response ""I Know! You should have it removed, you'd be much better off"".

If this is the shit that the intellectual elite in this country talk about and think, it's not much wonder why Joe Six Pack in rural America voted for Trump en masse.
