In a way, what.cd was a wonderful socialist experiment in what happens when profits are not involved and people contribute without monetary value as motivation. If you look at the reaction at the news in the trackers community, like in /r/trackers, people are not sad because their ""free music"" got taken down. They are sad their community is gone. What.cd was the only place where a lover of, let's say, 80's South-African jazz would find other enthusiasts, together contributing to archiving and cherishing this music. The idea that commercial platforms like Spotify offer a a place where “everything” is available is a bad joke to anyone with a serious interest in music. Do you think the market cares about culture over profits? 

Capitalism just put the fire to the modern Library of Alexandria of music because it was a danger to the myth of the efficiency of the market.

Highly recommended. Watch [the trailer](https://youtu.be/AUiqaFIONPQ), I am sure many of you will like it.

You can watch the film [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p04b183c/adam-curtis-hypernormalisation) if you're in the UK, but it's also available via the less legal means like torrents.

[Quietus review](http://thequietus.com/articles/21077-adam-curtis-hypernormalisation-review-bbc-politics-doom).
&gt;In 2016, the year of the EU Referendum, of Syria, of Putin and of Trump, HyperNormalisation feels almost jarringly perfect. In many ways, it's the film that Curtis' whole career has been building towards as many of the cultural, social and political undercurrents he's explored (mass manipulation, the surprisingly compatible goals of Islamic and neoliberal fundamentalism, the unintended consequences of developed world interventionism) seemingly begin to form an unstoppable tsunami. Its timing is uncanny - the film will arrive on the BBC iPlayer on October 16, just 23 days before Americans go to the polls and decide whether or not to submit to the leering rictus of mass insanity represented by Donald J Trump. And it will do its level best to offer an explanation of how America - and the world - came to this pass.  

[Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/09/adam-curtis-donald-trump-documentary-hypernormalisation)
&gt;Like all Curtis’s documentary work, HyperNormalisation exists in a twilight between disturbing truth and restless dream. It charts an eccentric course through the choppier ideological currents of our times: the origins of Syrian apocalypse; the collapse of political middle grounds and the rise of nationalism; the meaning of Putin and Assad and the Donald himself.",collapse,HyperNormalisation.

Coincidental, my weekly (Dutch) magazine had a literary criticism of Nabokov's Lolita this week which made me learn a lot about the deeper themes of Nabokov's novels.  

In the piece I read the author analyses that many of Nabokov's novel are about obsessions, and most of these obsessions are related to *time*.  

 In Lolita, the protagonist loves something (a young girl) that cannot remain thanks to *the passing of time* (the young girl will one day become a woman). Thus *time* fuels the unsatisfiability of the protagonist obsession: he can never truly possess the Lolita he loves.

The author also mentions Nabokov's *chronophobia*, a term Nabokov himself introduced (!) in his autobiography Speak, Memory. Nabokov's fascination and interpretation of time get more clearly explained by a literary analysis of Hägglund in his book [Dying for Time.](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674066328)   
See [this excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/0Yub1RP.png) (screenshot taken from Google Books) with a key sentence:
&gt;They [the characters in Nabokov's novels] seek to record time because they are hypersensitive to the threat of oblivion

Does this also sound like a character in Mr Robot?

If we look even further, (we are now reading an analysis of a literary criticism that is partly about Nabokov's novel, that's modern philosophy for ya) [the LA review of books](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/terror-and-beauty-martin-hagglunds-dying-for-time/#!) explains the concept *chronolibido* Hägglund introduces which is based on Nabokov's themes:

&gt;Put simply, the theory of *chronolibido* [...] claims that all desire, especially the religious desire for immortality, is bound up with a basic “investment in survival.” Even when we seek to transcend time, we do so because our time-bound lives can be lost. Our finitude is the foundation for all our desires, and all our fears. In fact, desire and fear — *philia* and *phobia* — form the flip sides of *chronolibido*, as Hägglund explains:

&gt;My key argument concerns the co-implication of *chronophobia* and *chronophilia*. The fear of time and death is generated by the investment in a life that can be lost. It is because one is attached to a temporal being (chronophilia) that one fears losing it (chronophobia). **It is because the beloved can be lost that one seeks to keep it, and it is because the experience can be forgotten that one seeks to remember it.**

I see this *chronolibido* a lot in Mr Robot. Quite literally, with White Rose and her fascination with time. More metaphorically, with Elliot being attached to Mr Robot and his personal motivations. And as intertextuality, by referencing the Lolita novel.

Maybe this a far stretch and are these philosophical theories too detached from the themes of Mr Robot, but I am interested what other people think.

Usually those updates are also integrated into the app later. The water pistol misrepresent the object being conveyed compared to Google's emoji, which is [a revolver](http://emojipedia.org/pistol/). Google's own emoji are displayed outside Whatsapp, for instance in the notification screen.

Imagine someone sending a water pistol with kids emoji in Whatsapp, to communicate they are having a water fight. In the Android notification screen, it will show up as a revolver pointed at kids. So this change might cause dangerous miscommunication. There are already cases of people getting arrested [for using emoji that communicate violence.](http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/a-12-year-old-girl-is-facing-criminal-charges-for-using-gun-bomb-knife-emojis-on-instagram/) 

Google already [changed their emoji within the Android 7.0 release](http://emojipedia.org/google/android-7.0/) to make them look more like iOS emoji. So they might have to change the gun to a water pistol as well. Whatsapp has 1 billion users, so an emoji change like this has a big impact. For many around the world it's their method of digital communication.  
But Apple, which Whatsapp sees as their emoji guideline, officially does not decide how emoji look, the Unicode Consortium does!
The unicode code chart [PDF](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F300.pdf#14) actually says “PISTOL = handgun, revolver”, and the reference glyph (with a larger version on page 3, 1F52B) is pretty clearly a pistol. **This is not a subjective case about which emoji are aesthetically better, but if the emoji communicate their intended meaning.**

Since Unicode does not have the power to enforce this, maybe Google should step in, since Android is the most used mobile OS. Enforce that emoji follow the Unicode guidelines whenever an app has a significant amount of users, to prevent miscommunication. The other option is to once again, change the Android system emoji to look more like Apple's, which emoji designers decided to not follow Unicode. This damages the whole purpose of Unicode in the first place, which is character encoding standards with a single worldwide standard for all languages.",Android,"Should Google enforce their own emoji to prevent miscommunication?

I thought it was a quite refreshing take on this heavy discussed topic. The closing paragraph seems to be an encouragement to a middle-road approach to the current student climate and free speech.

&gt;The students’ new-fangled vocabulary, such as the perpetual admonition of “privilege” and “micro-aggressions”, often mystifies their elders. Yet buried within the jargon are old-fashioned values that the most conservative fogey could embrace. Cultural “re-education” sounds Maoist, but helping staff to cope with students from different backgrounds is common sense. Campus Jewish centres are well-established “safe spaces”, to which no one much objects; places where minorities are able to feel inconspicuous or comfortable are perfectly sound ideas, provided people do not spend all their time in them. If sparingly deployed, trigger warnings, too, can be benign. A gentle alert to the impending description of rape, for example, may be less liberal craziness than good manners. [...]  “We’re students, we don’t know everything,” Mr Faloughi acknowledges. Yet sometimes, when they identify injustices that society has blithely tolerated, or opportunities for progress it has missed, angry students can turn out to be right.

I am highlighting the current developments from a privacy viewpoint.

The last months reddit (I am talking about the company reddit) is really changing their strategy. First they released their proprietary mobile app with ad functionality, while in the past all products by Reddit were open-source.
Reddit also changed their about page. [They used to have an about page showing monthly stats and a clear list of values reddit stood for.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160515173458/https://www.reddit.com/about/) A selection of the list of values that were written:

&gt;Default to transparency, and when you can’t be transparent, be honest.

&gt;Allow freedom of expression.

&gt;Allow people to be as anonymous as they choose, including ourselves.

Since around the middle of May the about page of Reddit has been changed. Gone are the monthly stats and instead it looks like a [standard start-up page,](https://about.reddit.com/) with business-vague fluff like this:

&gt;Snoo isn’t an asshole. Snoo likes to enjoy a good time. Snoo is humble. Snoo is kind. Snoo has high integrity. Snoo delivers.

On /r/changelog there was also an announcement yesterday that reddit will be changing their links to redirection links. They link through their affiliate silently, so you will not know you will click on a affiliate link at first.
Update: they just announced they will add a opt-out option in your reddit settings.

Update: /u/Gramatik pointed out that since a few weeks Reddit also changed the ""delete account"" page to a ""deactivate account"" page.

It looks like Reddit wants to move away from their transparent pro-privacy imago.
When looking at these changes, these current developments align with the statements Huffman, the CEO of Reddit, made during a technology conference last Thursday. [Here the video with Huffman explaining how they are going to make money.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PCnZqrJE24) 

(I watched and recorded this interview from the live-stream on thenextweb.com/live-forward/. Unfortunately I cannot share the complete interview unedited because youtube does not allow long uploads without verification with phonenumber. Edits are made clear with black screen pauses)

In the first half of the video, his ideas how they are going to make money are reasonable. Reddit offers communities and clear demographics to target your advertisements. He then also criticizes digg.com, for becoming a very sponsored platform and selling their users out. But then he makes some contradicting statements, he does not want to become the new digg, but it sounds a lot like it:

&gt;Huffman: ""One of the things I preach at reddit is confidence over caution. We need to do what's right for our business, and if we explain that to our users they would understand. If we have a reason why we do it and we articulate it, they will understand. Even if they don't like it.

&gt;Interviewer: But that's what digg said as well.

&gt;Huffman: ""They did it with no *finesse*. [...] We do the things we want with confidence, instead of being afraid of what the users are going to think. 

Later, they talk a bit about the mobile app, and then the interviewer asks how they are going to make money out of the app:

&gt;[Facebook has done us a huge favour in making people accept in-line native ads. That format is so good. \[...\] But our targeting will be different, because we know all of your interests. Not only just your interests you are willing to declare publicly on Facebook - we know your dark secrets, we know everything.](https://youtu.be/6PCnZqrJE24?t=499)

To me it seems like reddit is moving more and more to a business similar to Facebook, using users data to sell and target ads. What is unclear right now is how they are doing this. Is it based on my subscribed subreddits? It's based on what I upvote? Is it based on even deeper tracking? 

Huffman states that ""reddit will be reddit"", but at what cost? It's definitely not the pro-privacy and transparant reddit like they claimed to be back in the days. I understand that reddit has been a commercial enterprise ever since they got bought by Conde Nast, but it felt that they always tried to have a different business model than all the other big companies that own a lot of user data. Those days are definitely over. I am curious what you think (maybe I am blowing this out of proportion) and how the reaction of the majority of reddit will be, since Huffman claims they still will communicate changes.",privacy,"It looks like reddit wants to become a profitable business by using user data.

I took the time to comment on the bullet points and checking if they are actually valid points: the majority isn't.
 
Still, I feel like that it can be a lot better and cohesive. If you have something to add or how I can rewrite it better, let me know.

Here it is:

My comments on these points:

* No more nation building in the Middle East. He openly called the Iraq War a mistake even back when it wasn't cool to do so.

He is using hindsight there. He made these comments after the fighting had started and was running into trouble.
A politician like Sanders actively voiced his concerns about the war before it even started.

* He wants lower and middle class tax cuts. 

This will increase American debt - a few trillions more again.

[Source](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/23/Trump-s-Tax-Cuts-Would-Add-245-Trillion-Debt)

* He is focused on American jobs.

How is he going to create jobs? Only forcing some rules on China doesn't create some jobs.
&gt;Many of the jobs lost were in factories that made toys, clothing, furniture and other labor-intensive industries, 
which were relatively low-skilled. The manufacturing jobs that return will involve more technology and require more education and training.

[Source](http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/12/news/economy/donald-trump-china-mexico-jobs/)

* He wants to reduce student loan debt. Is against the government charging interest on student loans: ""That's probably one of the only things the government shouldn't make money off – I think it's terrible that one of the only profit centers we have is student loans."" Openness to lowering student loan interest rates and making loan forgiveness programs.

Trump hasn't outlined any specific reforms on how he'd reduce student loan debt. There is no evidence he said he is open to forgiveness programs.

* Wants to audit the Federal Reserve. 

He said this indeed. So does Sanders.

* Doesn't have any special interests groups funding him unlike the other candidates. Has called for all candidates to return the money they're getting back to Super PACs and to remove special interest groups from our election process.

True that he doesn't have any big funding. But Trump is a big businessman - he himself has special interest in these elections.
Look up Berlusconi for another person that was ""honest"" and ""was so rich he won't be corrupted"".

* Likes universal healthcare, is open to replacing America's broken system with something similar to Canada but better.

Trump describing his healthcare plan:
&gt;But for the most it’s going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.”

[Source](http://truthinmedia.com/trump-obamacare-government-universal-healthcare/)

Health care in Canada is delivered through a publicly funded healthcare system.


* Moderate on social issues (e.g. affirmative action, women's health, gay rights)

He is indeed moderate on affirmative action.


On women's health:

""Planned Parenthood does a really good job at a lot of different areas. But not on abortion,"" he said Sunday. ""So I'm not going to fund it if it's doing the abortion. I am not going to fund it.""

[Source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-planned-parenthood_us_56c9cff0e4b0928f5a6c3b38)


On gay rights:

&gt;Trump Said He Would “Strongly Consider” Appointing Judges To Overturn Same-Sex Marriage Decision.

[Source](http://www.hrc.org/2016RepublicanFacts/donald-trump)


* Focus on broad-based American nationalism instead of narrow and divisive race and gender identity politics.

If this is his focus, he has not succeeded yet. Calling for deportation of illegal immigrants, asking for surveillance of mosques, his wall - it has divided
America more than it has brought America together.


* Acknowledgement that political correctness is obnoxious.

He said this indeed. Even Clinton said something similar: “Good grief, we're getting offended by everything these days!” 

[Source](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/07/hillary-clinton-defends-madeleine-albright-women-female-voters) 

Not a very unique thing nowadays.


* Desire to put America first in trade deals instead of pure Wall Street globalism that exploits third world workers abroad and destroys domestic jobs.

Putting America first doesn't immediately result in no Wall Street globalism. Can't find any records of Trump talking about wanting to stop exploiting third world worker.


* Realist based foreign policy. (e.g. deal with Putin if it is in our national interest to do so, even if he isn't a nice guy).

""Bomb the shit out of ISIS and take their oil."" ""Build a wall and let Mexico pay for it."" These do not sound like realist based foreign policies.


* National pride. The man loves his country and thinks it is the best. Every country should have a leader like that.

He does indeed. If this is always good for a country is another question. Chauvinism is around the corner.


* Diversity: he employed women in leadership roles before it was popular to do that. And he did it in the construction industry of all places. 

He made sexist remarks to Megyn Kelly, if we are talking about Trump and women. 


* He has absolutely nothing against legal immigration, he's encouraged it many times. His grandparents are immigrants, his wife is an immigrant, several of his closest business partners in New York are immigrants. He is against uncontrolled, illegal immigration.

Many of his plans also are disencouraging to legal immigrants as well. Trump would raise the ""prevailing wage"" that H1-B workers must be paid, to make it less appealing for employers to hire them. And he would require all employers to ""hire American workers first"". 

[Source](http://www.vox.com/2015/8/16/9162905/trump-immigration)


* Hugely successful businessman, knows how to manage money, how to invest for the future and a fantastic negotiator. 

A quick google shows a dozen long articles disapproving this.


* Unlike other candidates, his economic plan actually makes sense. It would result in [""an 11 percent higher GDP, a 29 percent larger capital stock, 6.5 percent higher wages, and 5.3 million more full-time equivalent jobs"".](http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-s-tax-plan) 

I repeat, it will also increase the deficit by trillions.

* Take a look at this video of him [back in 1991 talking about how to utilize the upper class to re-invest in America or face higher taxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-HPlMHnORo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=86). Not only is he very knowledgable in economics and investment, but the tax structure he offers up back in 91' seems relevant even today to help alleviate some of the complaints we have about 1%'ers and wall street. 

Don't have time right now to watch this, so no comment on this one. 


* He's genuinely against TPP.

He said this indeed. So did Sanders.


* Acknowledges the danger of allowing mass refugees from places governed by fundamentalist terrorist groups, even if such acknowledgment is not politically correct. 

Political correctness has nothing do with this. European security organisations also have said this several times the last months. It's a very popular, undangerous opinion to have.

Het volledige rapport is [hier](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2016/02/01/twee-werelden-twee-werkelijkheden-een-verslag-over-gevoelige-maatschappelijke-kwesties-in-de-school) te lezen. Ik raad iedereen zeker aan het rapport te lezen, of in ieder geval de bloemlezing van de Groene.

Ik moet zeggen dat ik nogal geschrokken ben van de verhalen en ontwikkelingen die zich volgens het rapport tegenwoordig afspelen op Nederlandse scholen, specifiek het hbo, mbo en vmbo. Er is een polarisatie onder deze jongeren, die gefrustreerd zijn in de huidige maatschappij en hun heil zoeken in extremisme. 

Enkele passages uit het rapport: 

**Over de aanslag op de Twin Towers**
&gt;Hoe verschillend de standpunten liggen, merkte een docente toen ze tijdens een van haar lessen het filmpje wilde tonen van de aanslag op de Twin Towers in 2001. Twee van haar leerlingen wilden hún versie laten zien, een filmpje van internet waarin het vliegtuig onbemand was en de Amerikanen erachter zaten. Zo geschiedde. De docente besloot neutraal te blijven en haar mening over deze interpretatie voor zich te houden. Ze vond het voldoende dat deze jongens zich ook gehoord zouden voelen, dat beide waarheden – 9/11 is wél gebeurd versus 9/11 is een verzinsel – op deze manier naast elkaar konden bestaan.

**Over een discussie over discriminatie**
&gt;Een docente burgerschap van een mbo in Amsterdam was nog maar net begonnen aan de les over discriminatie, toen een meisje met een Marokkaanse achtergrond opstond. Ze deed of ze een wapen vasthield en ermee in de rondte schoot. „Als ik een kalasjnikov had, schoot ik alle Joden dood”, riep ze.

&gt;De docente zei haar dat Joden en meisjes zoals zij veel met elkaar gemeen hadden. Ze vroeg haar zich in te leven in een willekeurig Joods meisje van vijf jaar uit Amsterdam. Geen spoor van empathie. Het meisje wist alleen: de Joden moeten dood. Andere studenten, leerlingen van Turkse komaf en niet-moslima’s, begonnen hun klasgenoot bij te vallen. De Surinaamse studenten hielden hun mond. Aan het eind van de les kwam de boze leerling naar de docente toe. Ze was nu helemaal rustig en hoopte dat de docente op het goede pad zou komen. „Dat gun ik u.”

**Een les burgerschap**
&gt;Een docent met een Syrisch-orthodoxe achtergrond illustreert zijn bezorgdheid over die afstand met een recente kwestie. Hij gaf een les burgerschap en behandelde daarin de actualiteit in het Midden-Oosten. Een van de leerlingen kon niet goed onder woorden brengen wat IS precies was. ‘Zoek het op’, suggereerde de docent. De student ging aan de slag en vertelde even later wat hij allemaal te weten was gekomen, onder meer over een van de leiders: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. De student lachte omdat hij vond dat Baghdadi een beetje raar sprak, waarop een klasgenote, ze was moslima, overstuur raakte en begon te huilen. Ze voelde zich diep vernederd vanwege zijn commentaar op Baghdadi. De islam werd volgens haar belachelijk gemaakt. De studente verliet het lokaal en heeft daarna nooit meer een les burgerschapskunde bijgewoond. Als gevolg van haar verzuim heeft de studente onvoldoende punten gehaald en zal er een oplossing moeten worden gevonden, want het zou zonde zijn als ze hierdoor met de opleiding moet stoppen.

**Radicalere witte studenten**

&gt;De jongste docente, ze geeft pas een jaar les, is geschokt over de groeiende aversie tegen buitenlanders: ‘Studenten zijn ervan overtuigd dat vluchtelingen sneller een huis wordt toegewezen. Maar dat niet alleen, ze krijgen volgens hen ook gratis een elektrische fiets. Zomaar! Zo’n gerucht nemen ze voor waar aan en iedereen praat elkaar na. Goed filteren van informatie is lastig.’ De islam zien ze als een nare godsdienst, vertellen de docenten, en het dragen van een hoofddoek beschouwen ze als een straf van God. De studenten reageren steeds feller en ze zijn standvastig. ‘Bijna angstaanjagend.’ Sommigen weten zeker dat de foto van het verdronken Syrische jongetje fake is, onderdeel van een complot om het Westen medelijden te laten krijgen. ‘Wij gaan ons niet aanpassen’, roepen studenten ongevraagd.

Dit soort verhalen hoor je al langer, maar altijd had ik het gevoel dat dit incidenten waren. 
Nu heb ik het gevoel dat ik in het echte leven, en hier op de NL reddit, nogal in een bubbel leef. Hoogopgeleid, blank en progressief ben ik zelf en is mijn omgeving. Het huidige vluchtelingendebat vind ik verziekt en de PVV biedt geen enkele oplossingen. Rechtse media zoals Geenstijl zaaien alleen haat en polarisatie. Dit soort verhalen hoor je vanuit die hoek al vaker, maar ik zag dit altijd als incidenten en vooral als voer om alle moslims weg te zetten als terroristen.

Toch knaagt het er voor eerst iets na het lezen van dit rapport bij mij. Dit is officieel rapport van de overheid en nota bene geschreven door een journalist die werkte voor de Groene. 

Als het ons al niet lukt om in Nederland moslimstudenten, die hier opgegroeid zijn, welkom te laten voelen in onze samenleving, hoe moet het dan met de vluchtelingen? Hoe erg moeten we hier zorgen om maken? Zijn hier mensen uit het beroepsonderwijs met dezelfde ervaringen? Wat zijn eventuele oplossingen voor dit probleem?  Ik heb er voorlopig nog geen antwoord op.

I feel like I'm missing some great other writing, which might have a different/new view or perspective.

For instance, I'm also reading Der Spiegel's international edition and the occasional Zeit article. When commuting for a longer time, I sometimes listen to the Deutsche Welle This Week in Europe podcast. But of course there are other countries than Germany and UK in Europe.

From the Netherlands, I recommend NRC Handelsblad, a long running quality liberal newspaper, and de Groene Amsterdammer, which I would describe as a Dutch version of the New Yorker.

Le science or le bacon? Who will win? Place your bets.

I vote for le bacon. The science isn't sufficient here, because:

*  it's only the World Health Organization who has a research budget of 4 billion. It's from the UN, and the UN sucks because they hate gamergate and support Saudi Arabia.
* ""My grandpa eat bacon every day and never had cancer, I'm taking this report with a grain of ~~salt~~ bacon.""

* It's not in the first category, it only has a high probability instead of proven risk. Therefore, you won't get cancer.
