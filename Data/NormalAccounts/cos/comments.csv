1,"No, he's not.  He's proposing that people who serve in his administration will have to sign an agreement banning them from being lobbyists for five years after they leave their government job.  Which is an improvement over the similar executive order by Obama banning people in his administration from being lobbyists for two years after leaving their post.  Which was an improvement over no such thing before Obama.  But it's a small improvement, and had some holes in it, and Trump's incremental change will probably have even bigger holes, considering how he's loading up his transition team with lobbyists and considering so many lobbyists and corporate people for cabinet posts.

Edit: I should add that banning lobbying altogether would both be really bad policy and unconstitutional.  When I give to public interest organizations that try to affect policy to protect nature or people's rights, I'm giving to them in part so they can lobby.  When I was in DC one time and personally visited some representative's offices to ask them to support a bill I wanted passed, I was lobbying (nobody paid me for it, it was on my own time).  Corporations being able to buy lots of full time lobbyists with money, swamping the influence of all the public interest groups, and lobbyists going to government and then back to jobs where they get big bonuses for the changes they made while in government, and so on, are huge problems.  Lobbying-related corruption is a disaster for our country.  But ""banning lobbying"" isn't the solution and isn't practical.  Reducing elected officials' dependence on money, banning large contributions, more effectively restricting obscene corporate pay, and so on, are important parts of a solution.",2016-11-22 04:07:53+00:00,daajxvq,2.0,t1_daaj4zo,1184.0,Documentaries

13,"""States' rights"" as an abstract thing only came out of the right's attempts to defend first slavery, and then other forms of institutionalized racism.  It was a euphemism; it meant ""the right of states to discriminate against black people without federal interference"".

So, initially, the left's position on this was actually a mirror image of the right's.  The left's position was, that it is the role of the federal government to protect people's rights, and that includes being able to step in when states aren't doing so, and override those states with federal authority - to protect people's rights.

Over time, the right wing concept of ""states' rights"" got a bit more abstract, so this asymmetry has emerged where there now do exist a lot of people who think they believe in ""states' rights"" in the abstract.  Some of it ties in with idealization of the past, and going back to the original idea of the US as a federation of somewhat independent states.  That led to the civil war, a massive realignment of federal vs. state power, and some constitutional amendments, of course.  That past they idealize was an utter failure, and was changed through democratic and legal means, but they ignore that.

On the flip side, the left never abstracted this in the same way, into some concept of being opposed to states' rights in an abstract way.  Views on the proper balance of state vs. federal government are mixed on the left and always have been, but it's not ideological.  As you say, it's instrumental, it's about how to achieve good results or policies.

However, the left still believes the government needs to protect people's rights, and that when states fail to do that, it is appropriate for the federal government to step in and do so even over states' objections, and the federal government should do so.  That is clearly a part of the ideology of the left.  And even though Trump won't actually *do* that - his executive branch will be happy to let states oppress people without interference - the left's position on this is certainly not going to change.",2016-11-19 19:20:18+00:00,da791um,2.0,t1_da77cx6,2538.0,PoliticalDiscussion
14,"I saw your post but I think that doesn't quite reach my question.  However here's the part that gets a bit towards it:

&gt;  The reason they decided on electors was because many founders worried that having members of the legislatures (whether state or national) being direct voters would prohibit them from voting without bias (Federalist lawmakers are pretty much bound to always vote federalist since they need to strike deals and work with other members of their party). By forbidding electors from being a part of the national government, only private citizens could vote, who, theoretically were more open to voting for the ""best"" candidate.

This sounds like it's describing what the founders wanted and intended in 1786/87, where the idea was explicitly that electors should use their judgment.  What I'm saying is that by the time of the 12th Amendment, it was clear that the US was forming a party system, and the electors' roles would be to support the candidate of the party their state selected.

By this time, also, a number of states had already instituted popular elections for electors.  Such popular elections could just as well have been to select the states electoral votes, rather than to select the state's electors, if those electors were just expected to vote for the party that won anyway.

I'm asking why, during that time, when they *did* tinker with the electoral college system through a constitutional amendment, they still kept the electors?  And, what was the idea at that time of the role of the electors?

Perhaps the answer still lies in what you wrote, in that even though some states had moved to holding elections for president, other states still used their legislatures to select electors, and the leaders of the time still wanted to prevent sitting legislators from voting for president directly.  Is that what you are saying?  Was there actually any debate on that point at that time?",2016-11-19 19:02:04+00:00,da78b6k,2.0,t1_da77rnh,826.0,AskHistorians

16,"Thanks.  Some of those discussions were interesting, but I don't think any of them honed in on my specific question.  As I noted in my post, I'm aware of the idea that originally, electors were supposed to be educated men who would choose a president based on their own opinions.  However, there was the political will to adjust the electoral college system in the early 1800s, and by then a partisan system had already formed.  Electors were expected to vote for the party who won their state, whether it be their state legislature or a popular election that selected the electors.  What I don't quite get is why, at that time, they didn't replace electors having individual judgement, with a more straightforward system of each state having a certain number of votes to cast, and deciding how to cast them,without human elections being able to exercise individual judgement after the state had made that decision.",2016-11-19 17:11:01+00:00,da73tzg,2.0,t1_da727e2,2582.0,AskHistorians

But take for example, my tropical fish identification memrise course.  Don't get too hung up on the word ""course"", that's just the memrise term for it.  There's no need to argue that it's not really a ""course"", that's beside the point.  So, here it is:

http://www.memrise.com/course/750078/tropical-coral-reef-fish-identification/

I could make a personalized anki deck for it, perhaps - though from what I've read, anki doesn't support the memrise feature where you can have a bunch of images for the same fact/card/word, and each time it comes up for review it picks a random one for you.  But leaving that aside, let's pretend anki allowed that, then I could make a deck for myself to help me learn fish ID.

What I'm saying, though, is that I made this course as a public resource, for other people who also want to learn fish ID.  I'm doing a lot of work, to give them a resource for something they couldn't make themselves.  It's hard to find and sort thousands of reliably species-identified photos like that; it has taken me hundreds of hours.

I keep updating and maintaining it as time passes.  So not only does someone get this resource if they're interested in it, but as long as they keep taking it, they get the advantage of my regular updates.  More new photos for the fish they've already learned.  More fish added.  More informational levels about fish families.

And if someone finds a problem, and tells me about it, I fix it.  So anyone taking the course also benefits from the proofreading of everyone else taking it.

23,"What seems to be happening is that they're doing something rather different than what we used to know memrise as, and calling it by the same name.

Old memrise: A platform for anyone to create courses on any language or other subject, with a very flexible system for creating many kinds of courses, all using spaced-repeat.  Shared mems.  Discussion forums for courses.  Ability to add multiple maintainers to a course.  People could discuss the topic, report problems with a course, make suggestions, and get them fixed for everyone else.  People could share knowledge.  Make your own courses, or easily search a large set of other people's courses.

New memrise: A mobile app with a game-like system for learning the most popular languages, using courses created by their staff.  No community, no user-created courses, no obscure languages, no other subjects, no web site, etc.

As they've worked more and more on this new memrise, they've gradually let old memrise wither, and occasionally made changes to make it worse, and more recently they've broken it in a bunch of different ways that make it almost unusable.

For example, I can no longer add things from my own courses' databases to levels in those courses, which means I can't keep building my courses.  For another example, they decided that using commas to separate alternative answers is a problem for their staff-created language courses, so they changed that, effectively breaking probably a majority of user-created courses because you now have to remember the entire word list **in order** to get it right.  They did that on purpose and don't plan to fix it.  Other examples include getting rid of the course forums this past spring (in the new forum, you can't have a separate forum for each course, and besides, most people taking the courses don't even know the new forum exists and can't find it), or how they removed most of the useful course-search options such as sorting courses by popularity, or by new (to let you see what newly created courses there are in each category).  There are plenty more.

Voter impersonation fraud - where you vote by claiming to be someone else - is a crime, and very rare.  There are a tiny handful of cases where it has happened, but the risk of getting caught is high, it's criminal, and the reward is almost nothing; you're almost certainly not going to swing an election by voting pretending to be someone else, even if that does let you vote in a precinct where you otherwise couldn't have voted.  So that's why people trot out these fake alarming numbers about how mean ""dead voters"" are in registration databases, to try to imply that they're all somehow voting.  It's utter hogwash.

Now, the reason voting rights groups sue to block voter roll purges is because, although those purges generally use excuses like this, they actually always end up removing a lot of real, live, legitimate voters, who don't realize they've been removed until they show up to vote.  So in practice what happens is, to prevent that 1 in a million fraudulent voter - who would likely get caught - they end up removing literally thousands of real voters.

64,"&gt; The simple fact, yet these days nearly completely lost in the mix is that a ""journalist"" is suppose to be IMPARTIAL. Her views on the situation are NOT suppose to influence the reporting.

He, like Amy Goodman, practice some of the most important journalism in the world.  Amy Goodman's firsthand reporting of a massacre in East Timor under Indonesian rule, which then got covered in much of the world's press (but they only got that material because of her), may be responsible for East Timor's independence.

69,"&gt; Whatever your reasoning is, I'm sure it's good, but you may want to think about it. What's the point of using configuration management, if you're going to have people manually log into a server to configure a file?

People jump to a lot of strange conclusions whenever they get a hint that puppet is being used in any way other than the one true way, so I'll address that:  Puppet is great not just as the uber-configuration for an entire environment, which is what it was designed for, but also as part of a package where you have a standalone puppet packaged in a rpm or deb or something similar, and when you install it, uses puppet to put all its stuff in place and uses a cron job to ensure it stays good and keeps up with updates.  This strategy does get used in enterprises sometimes to mix and match different systems, sometimes coexisting.

Now, I'm personally not designing the system that I'm working with in this instance.  I'm just modifying some existing features of something that's already widely deployed.  People tend to jump to the conclusion that if I ask a puppet question, that means the entire system is mine to do with as I please or redesign from first principles, even though if they think about it, that's rarely the case.

However, I also have no problem with the way this system is designed.  I wouldn't criticize them and say ""take a step back and consider the patterns you're building"".  That feels presumptuous and condescending when you have no specific reason to say it because you don't even know what the patterns are.  Even though I'm in no place to change the design here, I think it's completely reasonable.  What they've done is set up a limited number of servers in each of many many widely heterogenous environments.  These limited number of servers do standard tasks that are useful in all of those very different environments, so they're prepackaged using a standalone local puppet.  But each one needs to coexist with the environment it's deployed in.  Sometimes, there are situations where configs or packages may or may not exist, but this puppet-based system needs to ensure certain things about those packages *if* they're present, *without* stomping on other locally customized aspects of them.

I'm not going to give sufficient detail to explain why puppet is a very good tool for packaging these kind of server configs, because it's not a public system and because I don't have that much time.  But it really is, for the thing they're doing.  It involves enforcing a bunch of constraints about what's on the server and what isn't, what versions of things are installed, and how a bunch of the OS is configured, on an ongoing bases, and pulling updates from a central app &amp; config server regularly.  This isn't a package that could just be a bunch of files, it's a package the majority of which involves twiddling OS parameters and other packages' configs.

You could say ""puppet wasn't designed for that"" and you'd be right, but nothing else was really quite designed for that either, and puppet is one of the best choices.  It works very well for this.  But sometimes some of its quirks get difficult around the edges, and it's worth trying to understand how to do things with puppet rather than write a new exec for every little thing.  Sometimes it turns out puppet *can* do the unexpected.",2016-10-18 15:08:22+00:00,d8xa5s1,2.0,t1_d8x8dt5,2264.0,Puppet

Chances are pretty good that the next Supreme Court Justice would not be opposed to a strong voting rights act.  The Senate would also possibly pass one.  But we'll need something like 10+ House Republicans to support such a thing, or maybe even 20, depending on how this election goes.

83,"&gt; However, when Syria began losing in the north, Sadat (in an incredibly stupid move) asked Shazly to attack further into the Sinai in order to ""relieve the Syrians"" (which was pointless, because the Sinai and Golan fronts were totally disconnected anyway). The attacks failed, since the Egyptian military was not prepared for this kind of offensive maneuver

I wouldn't quite put it that way.

a) It wasn't pointless, because Israel was having a hard time throwing reserves into each front, and if Egypt had been able to make a successful attack further into the Sinai, that would have diverted Israeli reinforcements away from Syria.  The fronts were not ""totally disconnected"" in that respect.

b) The attacks failed partly because Egypt hadn't planned for and wasn't trained for them, but also very significantly because they took the Egyptian army out of the range of their antiaircraft defenses which had been prepared in advance on the Egyptian side of the Suez canal and created a protective umbrella over the strip of land on the Israeli side that they initially took.  Once Egyptian attacks went beyond this protective umbrella, the Israeli air force could easily destroy them, and did.",2016-10-14 23:18:31+00:00,d8sfu11,6.0,t1_d8s51ed,15012.0,Israel
84,"Militarily, if viewed from an objective point of view, the 1973 war ended as a pretty drastic Egyptian defeat.  If the US and USSR hadn't forced a ceasefire, it's nearly certain that Israel would've taken Cairo if they wanted, and the Egyptian military would've been largely destroyed.

*However*, you can't view it out of context like that.

a) Compared to the previous wars of 1956 and 1967, this one was much less one-sided.  Egypt started out with a surprise attack that really did surprise Israel, and did shockingly well at first.  ""Shocking"" mainly because nobody in Israel or the rest of the world guessed that Egypt had the capacity to have *any* sort of military success against Israel, yet in the first few days of 1973 they showed that, at least briefly and in a context where they picked the time and place and manner of battle, they could actually win sometimes.

b) Even though Egypt Israel recovered and by the latter parts of the war was clearly driving Egypt back, it still wasn't as one-sided as the previous wars.  Egypt did continue to show a capacity to fight, and occasionally win some battles.  It was like a real war with two real sides.  This greatly restored Egyptian pride.

c) Even though Egypt never penetrated particularly far into Israeli territory, and even though at the end of the war Israel was holding a lot of Egyptian territory, there remained *some* formerly-Israeli territory that Egypt was still holding.  That in fact was Sadat's primary goal: to show that Egypt could seize *some* territory, even a little bit, and hold it.  They did that.

Most important of all, I think, that the war happened in a political context, Sadat had a smart strategy, the war was *part* of that strategy, and he succeeded.  While Sadat's ally Syria ended up a loser after the war, Egypt ended up a winner.

Sadat had, when he first came to power, tried to talk to Israel about a peace treaty.  He viewed being in a state or war with Israel as Egypt's biggest strategic threat, and he wanted to end that threat with a peace treaty.  He also, presciently, saw that being on the Soviet side in the cold war would be to Egypt's disadvantage; he wanted to switch to the American side - and he knew that making peace with Israel was a necessary prerequisite to doing that.

When he tried to make peace, Sadat found out two things:

a) Israel's right wing government under Prime Minister Golda Meir wouldn't talk to him, because Golda Meir didn't take him seriously (one of the reasons why I think she was one of Israel's worst Prime Ministers ever).

b) Egyptians viewed the idea of peace as a form of capitulation.  Israel had humiliated Egypt in 1956 and 1967 and making peace under those terms would be bitter.  He would lack support, and likely lose power, if he did it.

So, how to both a) get Israel to take him seriously, and b) restore enough Egyptian confidence, and shore up his own reputation of strength, to allow him to take such a vulnerable step?

Hence the 1973 war.  Although he allied with Syria, Assad had very different (and much less noble) goals.  But Assad gave Sadat what he needed to make this happen.  His goal, as you can see, was specifically tailored to serve his diplomatic strategy.  By showing he could seize and hold Israeli territory, he'd shock Israel into talking to him for real, while restoring Egyptian pride, and becoming the hero to Egypt who could afford the political risk of making peace with Israel.  And then switching Egypt from the Soviet to the American side in the cold war.

85,"Israel isn't monolithic and Israelis have many different experiences and points of view, of course.  Some of which I personally passionately oppose.  For example, I believe the right wing Jewish settler movement is actually Israel's most dangerous terrorist group, and the biggest threat to Israel - even though I'm Jewish and was born in Israel.  So in asking to understand OUR side of the story, you have to start by understanding that there are a *lot* of ""sides"" here.

Next, I very very strongly recommend reading [*The Siege* by Connor Cruise O'Brien](https://www.amazon.com/Siege-Saga-Israel-Zionism/dp/0671633104).  It's a well written, fun to read, fascinating telling of the story of how Israel came to be and came to be what it is, starting with the Jews' experiences in both eastern and western Europe in the preceding century.

It's somewhat a history book, but it's more a work of nonfiction storytelling combined with journalism, not a straight-up history book or reference work (though it has extensive footnotes).  Although O'Brien overall tries to be objective and present a variety of points of view of each event, his book really is focused on the story of the Israelis - they (we) are the main character of his story, and everyone else is considered in that light.  Which is why this is not a book I would suggest should be anyone's only source of the history of the formation of Israel and the Palestinian conflict!  But, this is also why I think this may be by far the best book for you, coming from your perspective, to answer your question.

Third, I want to point out a really basic truth that helps understand the situation but that seems to get missed an awful lot:  The Israelis were *refugees*.  Israel's initial population was, for the most part, a huge group of refugees who fled their homes, and their countries, and knew they couldn't go back, and would never got compensation for their lost property either.  They fled from war and violence and killing and persecution - and not just from Europe, but also from the major Jewish populations of the Arab world.  Places like Damascus, Aleppo, and Baghdad used to be major Jewish population centers until widespread violent racist riots forced them to flee.  They gathered in the one place where they thought there was a chance to build, from scratch, somewhere where they might be able to live and not have that happen again.  Often, people know these facts, but don't make the mental leap to thinking of the Israeli population in the early years as ""refugees"", though that is what they were.

You're presuming that closed is the only legitimate default.  In reality, how a marriage works, be it open or closed, needs ongoing consent from both people in it.  There's no ""automatically closed"" rule that people have to abide by.  If they can't agree, they can split up, or they can work out a compromise they're both okay with, or they can deal with the frustrations of disagreeing and having their partner do something they don't want.

More likely to split up - which of course is always an option he could pursue if it's what he wants.

122,"Regarding your struggle to pin down a definition of polyamory, I'll relate to you (in case you weren't already aware of it) that Jennifer who originally coined the word polyamory and caused the creation of the Usenet newsgroup alt.polyamory, left it after being told that she wasn't ""really poly"".  The trend to narrow down the definition of polyamory to exclude people has been around, at least on the fringes, since pretty early on, but it's a trend worth pushing back against.  As you found, there are many different ways of doing polyamory and many different communities and practices that can be encompassed by it.

I'd define it broadly as the belief and/or practice that one can have relationships without monogamy.  Where ""monogamy"" doesn't mean strict sexual exclusivity when one is in a Relationship; it means the idea that such exclusivity is the only legitimate practice, and if you're doing anything else you need to hide it.

That doesn't mean you *have* to actually be having relationships to be practicing poly - maybe you're just hooking up on an ongoing basis with two friends who are in committed relationships of their own, with the knowledge and support of their partners, for example.  Lots of people would like to exclude this from ""polyamory"" because nobody in this scenario is having multiple simultaneous romantic relationships, but it's totally poly, and fits within the definition I gave.

I'm leaving aside the distinction between polyamory as an orientation, identity, and practice.  People can indeed have one, two, or all three of the above, but I think the definition of what polyamory is remains the same.  For me, for example, it's all three; but the polyamory that is an orientation for me falls into that broad definition, while there are plenty of other people out there who aren't poly-oriented and would be happy in a monogamous relationship but happen to be practicing polyamory currently, and their polyamory also falls within that definition.",2016-10-04 20:59:01+00:00,d8e2q6u,1.0,t3_55v5iq,6955.0,polyamory
123,"This reads like a bad far-right conspiracy theory, but it may just be an attempt to spook people into buying gold for the sake of increasing its price to help people who already bought it.  The article quite clearly misleads, in any case.

Gold is not going up steadily like it claims.  Gold had a big dip in 2015 and has now recovered to around its 2014 levels, but nowhere near its 2012/2013 levels, which were significantly higher than now.  Part of that price recovery to 2014 levels was probably panic over the Brexit, which caused gold prices to spike a bit through June, but more recently, they're declining again.

However, if you do think gold is a great investment now, and will recover to 2013 price levels, the article misleads yet again by claiming you need to pay $1000 to buy an ounce of hard gold yourself.  You could just buy stock in something like GLD, which is simply a trust that buys a bunch of physical gold and has shares of stock.

124,"Different bits of the answer have been given by a few other comment, but I think they're mostly missing it - except for /u/CharlieKillsRats who pointed out that most low cost airlines *are* in at least some search engines.  That's true.

The answers about paying a (tiny) fee to the web site for each ticket sold are way off the mark.  Some of those tickets are ones they wouldn't have sold at all if they weren't listed on some of those web sites.  It's not a particularly effective way to save costs.

Southwest, as /u/CharlieKillsRats pointed out, deliberately don't participate in search engines as part of their brand and marketing strategy.  They want you to visit their web site.  That is indeed their thing.  And there are a few - very few - other airlines like that, who have decided that they want to heavily promote their brand and web site, and get you to visit it.  But for obvious reasons that's an unusual strategy for smaller niche airlines, unless they can completely fill a particular niche and market effectively to most of the people they need to reach.  For most low cost airlines, being on search engines is, all other things equal, a good move.

The real reason smaller airlines that compete with other airlines are much more likely than large airlines to be omitted from some search engines is the effort it takes to include them.  You can't just throw up a site that automatically has all the airlines.  For each airline a search engine includes, it typically needs:
 - their published schedules and fares
 - a data feed of their availability (which fares are available on which flights segments on which dates), which can change rapidly
 - an agreement with that airline company to include them
 - ""deep link"" standards, basically a way to understand how their web site works to be able to construct a link to make a specific reservation, and that airline willing to tell you when they're going to change their web site so you need to change your links.
 - a communication channel with them arranged to let you contact them about problems and let them contact you

So, first of all, if you're setting up a search engine, you go for the big airlines first because they cover the majority of your users' needs.  It takes less work to set up something to cover then 15 biggest airlines than to cover the next 100 airlines, for example, yet the first 15 may cover more flights and more user searches than the next 100 by a factor of over 100!  So you start big and then slowly gradually work your way down.  The long tail is *long*.

Secondly, those data feeds... a lot of the legacy carriers are interconnected and have standard feeds for things like schedule changes and availability, because they're all on one of a few ancient software platforms (Sabre, Amadeus, Travelport) that all talk to each other.  And then at the other end are all the tiny airlines out there that run on custom systems, often developed just for them, that are cheap and simple and lack what is by far the most complex of all airline software system capabilities: the ability to speak the legacy protocols and communicate properly with those big legacy systems.  Which means that getting data feeds from the smaller airlines is a one-by-one project, often involving custom software development, and setting up new leased telephone lines to your data center, and stuff like that.  It's slow, tedious work, that requires a lot of testing.  And remember, it's with much lower bang-for-the-buck: you spend much more effort and end up with only a few flights that serve a relatively small number of your users' searches.

It's not that they don't want to do it, it's that it can take many years for a system to get around to arranging deals with each of those airlines and signing the agreements and checking out the data quality and so on.",2016-10-04 04:07:03+00:00,d8d4odi,1.0,t3_55rjke,3687.0,explainlikeimfive
125,"&gt; I would only respond by saying that most of the weeding out that needs to happen isn't going to come from criminally prosecuting officers

Depends on what you mean specifically by attributing the source of the weeding.  I'll illustrate with an example: In 2003-2007 we had a very intense political contest in Massachusetts over legalizing gay marriage.  The court said legalize it, the legislature voted by &gt;75% to amend the constitution to ban it, but our state requires such an amendment to pass two successive sessions of the legislature before it can go to the ballot.  Meaning everyone who voted on it the first time is up for re-election before it gets voted on the second time.  To complicate matters, a second petition was put up to amend the constitution, but this one from citizen signatures, which means it only needed to pass the legislature with 25% support - but again, two successive sessions.  So we actually had a series of votes: first, the original one (not a citizen petition) got &gt;75%, next, that one got its second vote and failed with less than 50% but the citizen petition got about 50%, and finally, in 2007, the citizen petition got only about 20% and it died.  In just a few years we flipped *over half the legislature* from voting to ban gay marriage, to voting to keep it!  How?

Plenty of factors went into it, I'm sure, including personal lobbying, and so on, but I'm very confident that the one biggest factor by far was this: We won a few elections.  Not that many, not anywhere near half the legislature, because for the most part, incumbents got re-elected.  But, we actually beat a couple of incumbents in primaries 2004.  In 2005, a state senator died in office, and in the special election with 4 candidates all of whom were considered to have a chance, the one who opposed gay marriage came in a distant 4th, while the one supported by MassEquality came in a very convincing 1st.  By 2005, when three legislators resigned and special elections filled all three seats with gay marriage supporters, I think the writing was on the wall. Though we had to keep at it, because hey 25% is a really low bar and we really wanted to avoid the ugliness of having it on the ballot, I think victory in the legislature had basically already been attained.

The writing on the wall was this: Every single legislator figured out, within a year, that voting to keep gay marriage was no longer politically ""courageous"", it was the safe move.  Voting for it would keep you safe from primary challenges, and grant you tremendous support if you wanted to run for higher office.  Voting to ban gay marriage, on the other hand, turned out to be the courageous vote - something you'd do only if you really truly believed in it.  Because doing so invited tough primary challenges, and basically cut off your ability to run for higher office and win.

Here's the key: Not a single gay marriage supporter lost to an opponent in all the special and regular elections between 2003 to the final vote in 2007.

It wouldn't take some sort of mass purge of police officers, or any huge number in prison, to ""weed out"" the corrupt, violent, careless, or criminal ones.  It would take showing that those who do those things **CONSISTENTLY** go to prison.  That nobody's going to get away with abusing their power.  Showing that both to the police, and to the public.

Until we do that, nothing is going to fix this problem, and policing remains on a downward slope towards public vilification and distrust, the consequent ineffectiveness.

&gt; As to ""losing a citizen as an ally,"" I think that's kinda like not voting because you don't like the candidates.

No, it's not.  The fact that you see it that way puts you, I think, in the same mental space as many other police officers, and this is the sort of blindness that's threatening to rip out the soul of your profession.  You're losing me *because I fear you*, less personally than generally in terms of the consequences of seeking your action.  I fear, quite legitimately and for good reason, that if I get the police involved in anything, the risk of a really bad outcome is magnified.  That it's not my place to call down that kind of risk on other innocent people.  That we'll probably be safer if I don't get the police involved in anything.  You're losing me as an ally because of what I see as a rational pursuit of safety for my community.

To put it simply, your professing as a whole, regardless of how many good people are in it, is actively attacking our trust, and as a result, fewer and fewer of us trust you.  More of us fear the bad consequences of your involvement, and want to keep you out of our communities' affairs, for everyone's safety.

For example, even ""good"" police departments with supposedly decent practices spoke publically in favor of the corrupt power-mad NYPD's tantrums a couple of years ago.  That strikes real, deep fear in me and many other people.  Any police department that couldn't make a public condemnation of the NYPD at that time, is downright scary to me, because it shows they put solidarity with other police officers no matter how vile, over serving their community or desiring community trust.

Police officers are very reluctant to hear this sort of thing much of the time.  This problem won't be fixed until they start taking it to heart.

&gt; but if you want to help make change, there are ways to do that too. 

I help make change through political involvement, but I stay away from policing because it's so scary and toxic and threatening.  I try to get candidates elected who will hold police accountable.

And I say this as someone who did once work for a police department, though as a tech person, not a police officer.",2016-10-04 02:27:18+00:00,d8d0ten,4.0,t1_d8cr2ev,14320.0,ProtectAndServe
126,"&gt; What will hurt Trump the most is if Clinton became transparent and open showing she has nothing to hide

She's been doing that but it's far too late for a lot of voters.  Through decades of constant anti-Clinton conspiracy theories and hounding, a chunk of the right wing has been so convinced that there is literally nothing she can do to change their minds.  She's overall pretty above-board and quite honest, with the occasional flaw or mistake, but nothing rising to the level of lots of other people in high office who get a lot more public trust than she does.  She does not have the ability to fix that, unfair though it is, during an election campaign.  If she gets elected, she may be able to fix that while serving as president.

For example, so many people refuse to believe that the Clinton Foundation did nothing untoward, and the state department just saw the people that were relevant and appropriate for them to see, and that mounds of zealous investigation into the record could find no evidence otherwise.  Because it's so hard to prove a negative, and because people have these preconceived notions that won't be dissuaded when things they've been told ""look"" like possible problems turn up no actual evidence.  As above-board and appropriate as all those dealings were, and as thoroughly as they've been looked into by the press, many people's minds will not budge, and there's no way to prove otherwise to them.",2016-10-03 22:31:33+00:00,d8cr6ry,2.0,t1_d8cq8om,1341.0,inthenews
127,"&gt; And second, I think it partially falls into the trap that a lot of non-LEOs fall into when discussing this issue, in that it mixes up whether it wants police prosecuted versus disciplined. Justice and accountability does not mean more cops behind bars-- justice and accountability means weeding out people who shouldn't be officers, whether that comes to light before they hit the street or while they're on the street, and it means making sure that people who have proven they aren't qualified can't just start over fresh in this profession.

Actually, one thing that's really shocking to a lot of people is that police officers *can* routinely break the law in ways that would send others to prison, without going to prison.  Leaving aside arguments about how many police officers officers do that and what proportion of the total they are, it's incontrovertible that it happens multiple times a year at least in this country, and sometimes it makes it into the press and gets publicized.  When those officers evade prison for something that would send most anyone else to prison, that deals a *severe* blow to trust in police, and that means *people stop calling the police* - they stop reporting crimes.  That makes things more dangerous for everyone, including police officers - though police seem willfully blind to this effect, because, it seems to me, pretending that isn't happening allows them to continue feeling okay about the fact that there aren't more cops behind bars.

We **absolutely** need more cops behind bars in order to fix this cancerous problem.  It will not be fixed without that happening.  There's no way to weed out the bad without first going through that kind of reckoning.

Check out this article for some supporting info, BTW:

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/opinion/why-dont-you-just-call-the-cops.html

I dearly hope a preponderance of police officers absorb this before the profession ends up so generally vilified by the public that good people stop going into it altogether.  Because that's where we're heading.

For the record: Even though I'm a white man with no criminal record, I feel very ambivalent about asking police for help or calling on the police if something goes wrong.  I'm too afraid they'll hurt someone or ruin someone's life for no reason.  You've lost me as an ally in the community.  And it's entirely because I see so many police departments gone rogue, led by their unions (even when chiefs want to make things better), and acting as if they're above the law and above the public.  I'm growing more and more afraid of police despite not having had any direct bad interactions.  And this attitude that we don't need to imprison criminal cops is a huge part of why.  I know that attitude is shared by many police officers who think of themselves as good.  That's why I can't trust you.",2016-10-03 22:02:55+00:00,d8cpz0o,2.0,t1_d8bzllk,37040.0,ProtectAndServe

159,"Texas's law requires one of a few very specific kinds of ID, and excludes many commonly used IDs.  For example, student IDs aren't valid.  Federal employee IDs aren't valid.  State employee IDs aren't valid.  More than a *half million* legal eligible Texas voters don't have a form of ID recognized for voting.  So how would they get one?

Healthy adults who've learned how to drive usually already have drivers licenses, which are valid IIRC, but what about everyone else?  Seniors or people with health conditions who can't get a license because it would be unsafe for them to drive?  Or even people who just never learned - what, you have to take drivers ed and practice for months and take a driving test to vote?  That's not reasonable.

So how do you get an alternative ID that's valid?  Texas doesn't make it very easy.  For many people it could mean a trip to a faraway office, taking days off work during the week, and finding documentation they don't have, like an original birth certificate or social security card.

Because if Texas had actually meant to do that, they would've put in place a program to provide IDs for free to all eligible voters.  Including allowing people to get IDs on weekends, to apply online, and even mailed applications to known voters just in case they hadn't heard of the new rules on the news.  The could've instituted ID granting in high schools so everyone in school can get one there when they turn 18.

164,"You've kinda gone off the rails.  Try reading the comments above, again.  Jumping to huge overbroad strawmen like ""people weren't outraged at Bush"" isn't making a case for anything.

I'll try spelling it out for you as simply as I can, yet again:

a) /u/Thefriendlyfaceplant said sure Bush is a criminal, but asked ""what's the point"", presumably the point of this post.

b) Several people responded with their takes on ""what's the point"".  One of those was /u/hackinthebochs who wrote: ""to highlight the selective outrage.""

c) /u/JTRIG_trainee wrote ""Why can't we be outraged at both at once?""  It's a rhetorical question, of course, and people *can* be outraged at both, but it seems like /u/JTRIG_trainee was implying that there may not be any selective outrage.

d) Part of my comment addressed the above, by saying that I thought /u/hackinthebochs was referring to the fact that people hounding Clinton about this *weren't* outraged at both; they mostly had no problem with what the Bush administration did. Hence pointing out the ""selective outrage"".  I guess I was a bit loose in that ""the people"" could mean ""every single person"", whereas what I actually meant was ""most of the politicians and pundits leading the charge on this, and most of the people pushing it on social media"".  I'm sure exceptions exist and I didn't intend 100%.

e) **""this""** this context does not mean ""anything Bush might have ever done"".  It means, quite clearly and obviously, the Bush administration's use of private email servers, their longstanding obstruction of attempts to get those emails, and their deliberate deletion of large numbers of the most relevant emails that would've been both germane to the investigations *and* important historical archives.  People being outraged at Bush for skirting the UN, or coming up with the idea of invading Iraq for no reason, or gutting FEMA so it couldn't deal with Katrina, or any number of other things that were a big deal, is all utterly irrelevant to the point.

166,"Well, to answer your question on the level of this particular subthread in context, I think the point of that comment is to say that the people hounding Clinton about this *weren't* outraged at both; they mostly had no problem with what the Bush administration did.  Hence pointing out the ""*selective* outrage"".

But to answer your question straightforwardly in its own right, the reasons someone might be outraged by what the Bush administration did but not too terribly bothered about Clinton's email server could be that they're not the same, and what the Bush administration did that's being pointed out here was very sleazy and harmful, while what Clinton did looks like it was honestly intended to do her job well but happened to be a mistake.  She did not cause damage, except to her own reputation.  She didn't hide anything.  She's provided all the records requested, and fully cooperated with the investigation.

In contrast, the Bush executive branch hid nearly everything from their private email stash, including critical information about the lead-up to the Iraq war that most likely would've provided strong evidence of their intent to deceive the public into supporting an invasion on false premises.  They did not cooperate with investigations, and they appear to have done so in order to protect themselves from being outed for doing bad things.  In the process, they've also denied all of that material to history.

Now, sure, it's reasonable for some people to be outraged by these actions of the Bush administration and *also* be very upset at Clinton.  But it's also perfectly reasonable for other people to be outraged by these actions of the Bush administration and *not* think what Clinton did was that big a deal.  Because they're very different; what many of the right wing accuse Clinton of is what the Bush administration did and Clinton did not do.

Nobody cares whether we can trust that all the connections that come out of a Tor cloud correspond one-to-one with the connections that go into it, for example.  If a Tor cloud has some software on some nodes that produce extra outbound connections not initiated by any real Tor user, they'll look just like real user connections and nobody cares.

It *is* in fact very very hard to make a voting system that does not record who voted for what/who, yet can still be trusted to produce accurate results, and you asserting that it's not hard with no evidence whatsoever doesn't change that.  Yes of course in banking the fact that you record all of that data is a feature, but it's also what makes auditing and verifying things possible.  What ""well-paved path of e-commerce""?  Nobody has made an e-commerce system that's fully anonymous, yet whose aggregate results are reliable and verifiable and trustworthy.  Nobody has bothered to try, because it'd be pointless to do that for e-commerce.  E-commerce is not voting, it's a totally different kind of problem.  Bringing up TOR as an argument just highlights that you're either not thinking about this for real, or that you have no understanding at all of the problems, so stop arguing here and try to design the thing - or search for any design that others have made and the criticisms of it.

Such systems rely on the ability to *audit*, through a reliable log of everything that happens.

But there are automatic archived transaction journals and backups of all sorts, so you can can run various automated checks that things add up correctly, and reconstruct data when necessary.

Voting is different because anonymity is a requirement, while the reliability of all of those systems relies on careful records that inherently make anonymity impossible.  The bank knows whose money it is and who it came from.

243,"Not gonna happen, for a number of reasons, #1 of which is that the premise is flawed.  Saying ""both ... are bad choices"" is a very false equivalence.  Clinton makes a significant number of Democrats unhappy, sure, but in the normal way that happens every year; no candidate really satisfies everyone.  Trump is on a very different level.

Most of the remaining ""Bernie or Bust"" people were never actually Democrats to begin with, or left the party long ago; very very few actual Democrats would even consider leaving the party of Clinton.  A majority of Democrats actually like her, and a large majority of the rest, while unhappy with her to varying degrees, are not particularly *shaken* by her nomination.  Trump really makes a lot of long-time Republicans sick.  Trying to handwave that huge difference away by saying they're both ""bad choices"" really misses the point.

Another reason this isn't going to happen is that Sanders *enthusiastically* endorses Clinton, and is campaigning for her.

My faily moved away from Israel before I turned 7, though I still have family there, so while I'm fluent in modern Hebrew I didn't get nearly as much education in biblical Hebrew as if I'd grown up in Israel... and for me, biblical Hebrew is a struggle to decode.  About half of it mostly makes sense as is, and the rest takes a lot of thought and I often can't figure it out.  It's definitely significantly further from modern Hebrew than, say, Shakespeare is from modern English.  It's on a similar level as a modern English speaker reading Chaucer, but I think it's a bit more than that.

Instead of giving the name to the earliest account with that name, or the earliest active account with that name, they instead created a brand new site with its own separate usernames, and called it global username registration.  If any of those existing users happened to find out about this site (and I don't know how; I certainly never got an email about it or saw any notification about it when I logged into wikipedia), they could register their username there, for the sole purpose of keeping their username on the wikipedia sites.  A few years later, when the username system was unified, they gave precedence to whoever had registered at that global username site, and forcibly usurped usernames from anyone on any of the wikipedias, no matter how active, if their name had been registered by someone else on the global site, even if it had been done recently.",2016-07-30 15:19:50+00:00,d5x81re,2.0,t1_d5wux8o,37373.0,wikipedia

Yes, it was exactly that process that you described.  However, I'd been active, and had had the username for years longer than the other person, so it doesn't make sense to me that they'd give precedence to the person who signed up years later.

What they told me at the time was *not* that they gave the name to whoever was ""more"" active.  They said they didn't consider accounts that hadn't made any edits, so if only one of a set of competing usernames had made edits, that one got the name.  That kinda makes sense.  But in the case of multiple active accounts, they gave precedence to whoever had signed up for some obscure ""global username registration"" system they set up that I'd never head of, that hadn't existed when I created my account or for years later.

They explained this all to me at the time, but I feel that it's ridiculous, that they're being assholes.  I feel very strongly about my username that I use on lots of sites and that I used for editing wikipedia for well over a decade.  I had it first and there was never any sign from them that it could be stolen later by someone who signed up much much later, and who I have no way of contacting (yeah, yeah, I did comment on their user page, but we don't speak the same language and as far as I know they never even looked at their user page; they certainly never responded).

&gt; The whole process was a pain and unfortunate, but necessary for the end result of having single user logins.

A fair and reasonably process would've given right of first claim to whoever had the username first, like every other online service with usernames everywhere ever.  That would have had the same end result of having unique usernames.

If they'd done that but just excluded accounts that never made any edits, that too would've been fine.  If they'd actually facilitated communications between users directly through the renaming process, such that the original owner of a username could say if they don't really care in the case where someone else cared more, that could also have been a useful thing to do.

But just outright stealing the username from the first owner to give it to a later owner because the later one happened to learn about their obscure poorly publicized much-newer ""global username registration"" site, is utter assholery that makes me loathe and despise wikipedia.

Do they?

I thought they were widely regarded as a good charity, until they got a right wing person in charge who decided to cut off their support of Planned Parenthood.  At which point it became very clear how much more people value Planned Parenthood - for good reason, since they provide basic health care services to such a huge number of people - and how angry people were at Komen.  Lots of people who had contributed to Komen switched to donating directly to Planned Parenthood instead.

But none of that has anything to do with whether Komen is a good charity in other ways, or whether or not they waste their money.  Charitynavigator basically covers only two things about a charity: a) How transparent they are, which is basically how easy it is for others to know what they charity is up to and see if it's honest, and b) How efficient they are, which is how much of the money donated to them actually goes to directly benefit the cause it's donated for, vs. spent on administrative and fundraising expenses.

274,"""Unicorn"" started out in poly circles a long time ago as simply a way to refer to a bi poly woman open to dating a M-F couple, and generally also mostly-single or at least not in a serious long term relationship with someone else.  That's all.  People started using this word not for any negative reason, but simply because there were so many more M-F couples specifically looking for a single-ish bi poly woman to be in a triad with both of them, than there were single-ish bi poly women looking for that, so people joked that they were ""unicorns"" - very hard to find.

""Unicorn hunter"" came later, and it carried the implication that the M-F couple was looking only for a bi poly woman, not for any other kinds of involvements.  They're not open to dating separately.  They have an idea in mind, they want a third for their couple, the third has to be a woman, the third will have sex with both of them, and usually, the third will not be in some other serious long term relationship.  Now that they know what relationship they want, they're looking for someone to fit into it.

Because of that, ""unicorn hunter"" has been used with negative implications often - though not always, and some people even self-identify as unicorn hunters.

Now, based on this post, it really doesn't sound like the couple being described are ""unicorn hunters"".  However, when you say,

&gt;  However, places like Reddit have usurped the word ""unicorn"" to simply mean ""a bi girl that dates/sleep-with another couple.""

... that's a bit misleading.  Unicorn simply meaning ""a bi poly woman who will date a M-F couple"", that's a meaning it has had since many years before reddit existed.  If you broaden it to just mean a woman who has a one time threesome with some other couple, then yeah, that's broader than the term originally meant.  But of course that's not what OP seems to be describing, either.

291,"Unicorn hunting originally meant when a male+female couple are specifically looking for a bi poly woman to date them both.  It's not a ""threesome"" (a sexual encounter), but it's also not those other things you say - or at least, those are things that some people later added on to the term but many people did not, so while some people do think of those things when they say ""unicorn"" plenty of other people don't, and won't get that implication.

Unicorns got named that way not really because they don't exist at all, but because there were so very many couples looking for these unicorns, and especially since many of those couples didn't want anyone who was already in a serious relationship with someone else, that the number of real life bi  mostly-single poly women open to dating a couple was much much smaller than the demand for them.  People would joke that this was like looking for a unicorn.

However, the key feature of unicorn hunting, from the beginning, was the fact that there was a pre-existing male-female couple who, rather than meeting a woman who they happen to both fall for, were looking for a woman to fit that slot in their relationship, before they'd even met her.  The relationship slot was already there, and now they were looking for someone who they could put there - which often colored how things played out because the couple already had some pre-existing illusions about what the relationship would be like, formed before ever meeting the person the relationship would be with.

This is not why unicorns got named unicorns.  That was very much about the very high demand for single poly bi women by M-F couples, making it much harder to find such partners.  But it is the key feature of unicorn-hunting that gives it the characteristics we often see: it's about designing a relationship slot and then looking for a person to fit into it, rather than meeting a person and then forming a relationship with them.

Yeah, I know that's how it's done, and she does really great work so I hope they keep having her do the signs.  However I don't think there's any reason they couldn't tweak the process to also add a temporary printed list of species names next to the tank when new fish are added.  That could be done much more quickly.  It could be just thick paper slid behind a glossy cover or something.

335,"Interesting!  Okay, initially when I was trying to learn how to tell juvenile princess vs. striped apart, I noticed in the Humann &amp; DeLoach book that the juvenile princess has a white dorsal stripe while the juvenile striped has a black top, so I started looking for that as a sign.

However, I then found that a) http://reefguide.org/carib/stripedparrotfish.html shows a few juvenile striped parrotfish with white backs that don't look that different from princess parrotfish.  Also, b) in the wild, I got several pictures of juvenile parrotfish with very white dorsal stripes (not dark at all) that also had no dark tail edges *and* yellow-smudged faces.  I read that yellow-smudged face is a sure sign of a striped parrotfish; juvenile princess parrotfish never have that.  If that is true (do you agree?) then those must've been striped, and therefore juvenile striped parrotfish can have fully-white dorsal stripes.

Yellowing fins isn't a sign I've thought to look for as a differentiator, yet, so now I'll start.  Thanks for pointing that out!

But look at this puddingwife, on Wikipedia:

Wait, so that character limit is hardcoded and no subs can override it?  In that case, I guess some subs are taking shorter-text flairs and replacing them with longer text using CSS?  A perfect example of the sort of thing that would make a really useful example in a tutorial.

&gt; &gt;    How does the link flair relate positionally to the post title by default?

&gt; It is in the structure of the HTML [...]

I see how the span with the linkflair comes before or after the a tag in those examples, but what I don't get is what controls that.  How do you decide where the linkflair comes in the html for a sub?

[Edit: Oh, nevermind - I was misled by your answer into thinking that you were telling me I need to control the position of these HTML elements relative to each other.  The actual answer is that it's a simple setting that reddit provides and I can just select the one I want.]

&gt; When you select a ""css class"" when creating your link flairs, that class is applied to post container, so you can style any element inside a post based on the link flair.

Ahh, I see - I could add CSS for "".linkflair-CLASS a"" to style any links on the flair'ed post.  Presumably there's a selector to allow me to style only the post-title link and not other links in comments, and so on ... but to find those, I have to view source on a bunch of reddit posts and see what selectors they all have in common and try them out.

Usually the book will have a separate photo and ID marks described for juveniles or different phases, when they're different enough, but it's possible it left this one out.

This one also lacks the dark dot at the base of the pectoral fin that they all seem to have, and its mouth seems to have an overbite while all the other photos I find of sixbar wrasses have a more even top vs. bottom lip.

Another mismatch is the tail shape - all the other sixbar wrasse photos I've found have the top and bottom edges of the tail extending further out than the middle, but this one has a mostly squared off tail with rounded edges, where the top and bottom stop a little short of the middle of the tail edge.

386,"&gt; For example the mover to re-enfranchise felons is driven by the democrats - they reasonably assume most felons are going to vote D if at all. That could backfire - I'm waiting for a poll that says ""80% of felons support hillary.""

You're missing something, and also holding an unwarranted assumption, in this bit of text.

What you're missing: Ex-felon voting bans are about race, again.  Minorities/people of color are disproportionately arrested for doing the same things white people do, and are disproportionately convicted of felonies.  Bans on ex-felons voting therefore skew towards reducing especially black people, but also latinos, from voting, at significantly greater rates than white people.  There's a reason ex-felon voting bans are more common in the south than in the rest of the country, and that most of them were passed after reconstruction and into the Jim Crow era.

Your unwarranted assumption: Yes, Republicans push voting restrictions specifically to help them electorally, so it's easy to look at it and think cynically that Democrats do the opposite for the same reason.  But as you surely know, based on the example of you yourself, plenty of people just believe that we should increase voting participating broadly, that voting should be easier, that democracy is fairer and more effective the fewer obstacles there are to voting and the more of the population is represented.  People who feel that way are much more likely to be Democrats.  So while surely there exist some Democrats whose primary motivation for expanding voting rights is to seek electoral advantage, I highly doubt they're anywhere close to a majority.

Actually I think she said that stuff multiple times, but certainly at least one speech that was recorded and available online.

She forgot that her opponent in the 2010 race, Jerry Brown, had previously been a two-term governor of California from 1975-1983.  Term limits made him leave that office, but they only apply to consecutive terms, and now many years later he was running again.  How many years later?  Well, a little less than 30!  ""30 years ago"" had been in the middle of Jerry Brown's *second* term as governor.

Meg Whitman was basically saying she wanted California to be like it had been, deep into Jerry Brown's long governorship.

This allowed Brown to run ads like this in 2010: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEPlZYp5-Pk

They then gained their strength partly from recruiting large numbers of former Iraqi military, including senior officers with logistics and strategic experience, *because we fired them all* - again, a Bush administration act.  And they collected lots of US equipment, and gained lots of combat experience, fighting the US occupation, while recruiting plenty of new people radicalized by the US invasion of Iraq.  And where did much of their senior leadership meet and get to know each other and form the networks that they used to organize later?  US prisons in Iraq, where we (again, during the Bush administration) gathered large numbers of people - many of them previously innocent but now given incentive to work against that US.  So when Syria devolved into civil war, Al Qaeda in Iraq / ISIS was ready to move in.  Better organized, larger, more experienced, better equipped, than any of the homegrown Syrian rebel groups, they took over the anti-Assad war and turned it into their own Islamic State.

* Diagonal bar along the front from snout to dorsal fin starts light in initial phase, gets fully black in large terminal phase.

We'll find out California's result fairly soon, and we all know that whatever it is, Clinton will have a majority of *pledged delegates*, very likely by over 200.  Maybe over 300.

Yes, Sanders is the better choice.  Yes, he would do better against Trump than Clinton.  But neither of those things changes the reality that Clinton won the primaries and superdelegates will not reverse that.

*If* Sanders narrowly wins California, any motion at the convention that tries to make it so that *all* of California's superdelegates must vote for Sanders even when Clinton got nearly half the state's votes, would absolutely be rejected by a voting body that has more Clinton supporters than Sanders supporters.

437,"&gt; Tomtate. http://www.bossen.ch/frank/v4/show_species.php?id=895&amp;pid=1178

Hmm.  Pretty sure it's not...

Adult tomtate (as in the photo you linked) never have blue lines around the face like that, and they always have a very straight solid line from the snout through the eye all the way back to the tail, which this fish doesn't have.

But this fish is probably a juvenile, not an adult.  I found juvenile tomtate in my book, and they look nothing like this - their body shape is very streamlined, like smallmouth grunt but even a bit more elongated.  They have a few very straight dark lines running across a light body, no blue lines, and a white unlined lower half.

Since my book only has only one photo of juvenile tomtate, I could maybe believe there's a color variation that is more like this fish, though it would be quite a stretch.  But with the shape being so different too, it seems very unlikely to me.

Do you know that juvenile tomtate can look like this fish?  Or, have a source or photo that suggests this fish might be a tomtate?",2016-06-02 00:18:50+00:00,d3sgs6m,2.0,t1_d3sbc3t,8311.0,whatsthisfish

450,"&gt; Even though it's a pacific tank the yellow fins make it look a bit like Stegastes partitus...

I snorkel a lot in south Florida and the Caribbean (and recently started diving too), since it's the tropical reef area that's the shortest travel time from where I live, and bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) are one of the most common fish in shallow areas around there, so I've gotten to know them very well.  I could probably pick them out just from their movement pattern by now :)  Also from their shape, even if the color were somehow blocked out.  If this fish were a bicolor damselfish I'd never have posted it here, because I'd have known what it was instantly :)  Not only its color pattern but also its shape is all wrong.

[I didn't think about it before you commented, because I never considered bicolor damselfish as a possibility, but now that I'm looking at them I think the main features that make it look wrong for that species are a) its tail isn't forked enough, and b) the head has a bump/peak that looks too near the forehead, bicolors slope more gradually and roundly.  Also, while the rare bicolor damselfish may be dark all the way to the back, such an individual would certainly not be *lighter* all over the front than in the back, and it also wouldn't have a yellow pectoral fin.  Besides, I'm pretty sure even those individuals that are dark all the way to the back still have a distinctly less-dark area around the tail base, with a distinct (though not sharp) border, not a smooth gradient.  Well, cool: another case where getting a mistaken ID helped me learn to see some details more consciously.]

Indo-Pacific fish, on the other hand, I'm much less familiar with.  I've snorkeled a bunch in Hawaii, but this doesn't look like any common shallow-depth Hawaiian fish I remember.  Also the Galapagos, but that's eastern Pacific, which is mostly distinct from Indo-Pacific - I don't think there's any overlap between fish I saw in the Galapagos and fish that are in this big Pacific reef tank, though this tank does have some fish I've seen in Hawaii (such as bird wrasses).

I did think initially that the shape of this particular fish, and the texture of the pattern on its side, looked like a Dascyllus of some sort.  But I looked up various Dascyllus species and it violates each of their key ID marks in some way, as far as I could tell.  But you can see several Dascyllus species on Keoki Stender's page that you linked to - see why I think this fish generally looks like this, but doesn't specifically look like any one of those species?

480,"Press coverage is really obsessed with who ""won"" each state, and it's highly misleading.

In the final presidential election in November, each state (with two small exceptions) votes with *all* of its electoral votes for the 1 candidate who won more votes than any other in that state.  Even if they won by just a few votes.  So in that election, focusing on who won each state makes sense.

In the Democratic primary, each state gets a bunch of statewide delegates, plus some delegates for each of its congressional districts.  Statewide delegates are given to the candidates proportionally to how many votes they got in the state in total; congressional district delegates are given to the candidates proportional to how many votes they got in that district.  Overall, it generally works out to very close to proportional for the whole state, though, so you don't need to worry too much about the difference between statewide vs. district delegates.

In a Democratic primary, there's no such thing as ""winning"" a state, really - not in a meaningful way.  Delegates are what matter.  If you ""lose"" a state 49-51, that may end up with the same delegate count as if you ""win"" that same state 51-49, so it makes no difference who ""won"".  On the other hand, there may be a very big difference between losing 30-70 vs losing 45-55 - that can change the delegate count a lot.  Yet the press acts as if the difference between 49/51 and 51/49 is a huge deal, and as if 30/70 and 45/55 are about the same thing.

Ignore their hype about who wins or loses each state in the Democratic primary, and pay attention to a) how many pledged delegates each state has, b) what the actual percentages are in the election results, and c) a day or two later, how those percentages translated into pledged delegates for each candidate.

http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/D-PU.phtml has a good running tally.",2016-05-18 19:44:38+00:00,d3an4mp,1.0,t3_4jvqwn,38869.0,Ask_Politics
481,"It's unclear.

People jumped to that conclusion because Nader got more votes in Florida than the difference between Bush and Gore in the final count official count.  If you assume that most Nader voters would've voted for Gore if Nader hadn't been running, then you can say Gore would've won Florida and the presidency.  But that assumption doesn't seem solid: exit polls and later polls and analysis suggested that only a minority of Nader voters in Florida would've voted Gore; the rest would've voted for Bush, or another third party, or not at all.  They actually suggest that maybe *more* of them would've voted for Bush, than for Gore!

How can that be, you wonder?  Well, it seems that people knew it was going to be a close election, so nearly all of the true supporters of Gore (or of electing a Democrat) who lived in a swing state like Florida, actually did vote for Gore, even if they preferred Nader.  Those who ended up voting for Nader despite knowing they were voting in a swing state in a super-close election, may have mostly been people who a) didn't care if Bush or Gore won, or b) hated both Bush and Gore, or c) were committed to voting for a third party, or something like that.  In other words, there's a strong possibility that Nader didn't actually siphon away the votes Gore needed in Florida.

But wait, there's also New Hampshire!  It wasn't in the news as much because there was no scandal about the vote count, and people generally trust that the official results in NH reflect the real vote (unlike Florida, where it's absolutely certain that more voters wanted Gore and the official results did not reflect reality).  Bush won NH by a narrow margin of less than 4,000 votes, and Nader got over 22,000 there.  So maybe Nader didn't cost Gore Florida, but he did cost Gore New Hampshire?  And if Gore had won New Hampshire, he would've won the election even without Florida.

But hold on there - that whole analysis is fundamentally flawed.  People seem to assume that voter preferences are set in stone, that candidates just fit into pre-defined slots, and that campaigns don't matter.  Even though we know campaigns *do* matter, and people react to them.  So consider this: One of the main problems Gore had was in rallying Democrats and liberals to vote for him, because he disavowed Clinton and he kept pretending to be just like Bush.  Various polls showed that Gore had weakness on the left - that he was losing a lot of support from people who wanted him to be more of a Democrat and felt unenthusiastic.  However, Nader's challenge actually caused the Gore campaign to change their strategy - and take some positions - specifically to capture more of those voters.  This is well documented, that Gore and his team discussed Nader and made these decisions because of Nader.  It's quite possible that the mild shift in campaign strategy Gore made in reaction to Nader's challenge, gained him thousands of votes in both Florida in New Hampshire (and other states all over the country).

So the answer is, it's not clear.  Maybe Nader cost Gore the election.  Maybe he didn't.  Either possibility is plausible and reasonable, and we'll never know the answer.",2016-05-18 19:32:17+00:00,d3amieg,1.0,t3_4jwwc8,18470.0,Ask_Politics

487,"&gt; fear that while the feds are picking up 90% of the tab now, in a decade or two they might shift the cost to the states. 

That's not a legitimate fear, it's a contrived excuse.  If the costs shift too much to a state and they can't afford it, sometime in the faraway nebulous future, then the state could scale back at that time.  In reality even that unlikely hypothetical is not much of a reason, because covering more people under Medicaid reduces other costs and saves the state money, even if the state were paying a higher share of the coverage.

But whatever, let's ignore that part and focus on the basic lack of logic: We don't want to provide coverage we can easily afford, because at some point in the future the federal government might change the program and we'd rather never provide help people at all, than provide help for however many years we can practically do it and then stop when it's less practical to do.

495,"&gt; one paragraph says that the flail was a copy made in 19th century but in 16th century style, calling it in essence a copy, but the fact that its a copy means there was an original back in that time which makes the rest of his argument completely trash

This is not a logical objection in context:

&gt; Here, the Met describes it as “probably mid to late 19th century in style of 16th century”. It is, in essence, a copy—but a copy without an original—more art than weapon.

What the article is arguing is that the idea of a flail existed at the time this ""copy"" was made, and it wasn't a copy of any actual flail, just of what the artist believed the 16th century style to have been.  In other words,

&gt; If it is a simulacrum, the original inventors were not weaponsmiths but illustrators. The weaponsmiths who made them—in the sixteenth, nineteenth, or twenty-first century, were just copying an idea rather than a thing.

Now I'm not saying that I know that to be true, just that your objection does not hold up - you either skimmed or misunderstood, and decided that your misunderstanding undermines the article's argument.

516,"&gt; Let's say I cast a vote for Bernie. But, because the delegates vote against him, my vote is worthless.

It doesn't work that way.  Bernie is winning his fair share of pledged delegates, based on how he's doing in the primaries.  Clinton has won more pledged delegates, because she's done better in the primaries - more primary voters have voted for her.  Your vote counts, but so do Clinton's supporters' votes, and there have been more of them voting in the primaries, so she's been winning more delegates.

Technically, the superdelegates - who are not elected in primaries/caucuses - *could* vote to give the nomination to the loser of the primaries if it's pretty close, like this year.  Because Clinton's lead over Sanders isn't that huge, it's theoretically possible for the superdelegates to vote overwhelmingly for him and give him the nomination even if he loses the primaries.  But they won't do that.  They wouldn't do that the other way, either - if Clinton were losing the primaries to Sanders, then he would get the nomination.

524,"&gt; I am leaving the Democratic Party because it is decidedly not democratic in nature, due to super-delegates. I will be writing in Bernie Sanders in the main election!

This doesn't make sense: Sanders is losing the primaries.  Clinton is not about to become the nominee because of superdelegates, she's about to become the nominee because she has won a lot more pledged delegates than Sanders, through people voting in primaries and caucuses.

I'm not happy with Clinton and I've given Sanders a lot of money, but the reality is, Clinton is winning the actual votes.  He's doing well, far better than most people expected (although I always thought he had a solid shot at the nomination so I'm not surprised), but she's winning.  Claiming that you won't support her because the party is rigging the convention vote, when she's actually winning the *primary* vote, is self-contradictory.

-----

Sanders intends to vote for Clinton if she's the Democratic nominee, and I think he hopes you will as well.  If the Democratic nominee doesn't win, Trump becomes president.

The election is not an opinion poll or a place to express your views, it's a way to select who will *actually* become president and have a lot of power.  You can't just sulkily choose your personal favorite when you know they're not going to get enough votes to win; voting is not an individual act, it's part of an organized process where you have to compromise with people you don't necessarily agree with, to get the best result you can.

Each of these strips has some different kinds of birds, although others range through the whole area.  And of course the two ends, 2 miles apart, may have totally disjoint territories and different individuals of the same species.

Or does it make no difference?

532,"&gt; The eBird mobile app has the guideline that stationary should be used when you move less than 30 meters. I have never used the area, and I mainly use traveling or stationary. 

I saw that advice in the FAQ, but it seemed to be addressing whether you should choose stationary vs. traveling, not vs. area.

&gt; I think it is recommended that you out the maximum number of birds you saw at any one time. So if there's 4 on the feeder and 5 on the fence and 3 on the ground then put 12. 

I'm not sure what you mean by breaking it out to all the different locations they are, since I assume you mean if I see 12 simultaneously, I should put 12 - it shouldn't matter which ones are on the feeder, fence, or ground.  In my example, if I only ever saw 4 simultaneously, even though there were house sparrows there throughout the day, you're saying I should put 4, yes?  Even in a situation like that where there's very high likelihood that there are many many more than 4, since I can't prove there were more than 4, put 4?

&gt; In that situation I would submit 9 or 10 yellow warblers. If you are walking a path or driving around a refuge you should traveling instead of several stationary. 

Do you say that based on knowing that yellow warblers will stay in the same small area and thus you're confident those weren't the same warblers?  Because, this seems to contradict what you wrote for #3.  I can't prove they weren't the same six warblers, spotted 20 minutes later and again 40 minutes later, at different spots.  I never saw more than six at once.

&gt; In that situation I would submit 9 or 10 yellow warblers. If you are walking a path or driving around a refuge you should traveling instead of several stationary. 

This I disagree with.  If, for example, I think there were 22 or 23 or 24 or 25, I may not think any of those numbers is a better estimate than any of the others.  I have no reason to choose 22, or 24, specifically - neither of those is my best estimate.  My best estimate is approximate.  If they can't analyze the data when it's *better*, and require it to be more precise but *worse*, that seems like the analysis is based on broken premises.  22-25 is distinctly *more accurate* in that situation, and expresses my best estimate, while any one of those numbers on its own does not express my estimate accurately.",2016-05-09 18:06:58+00:00,d2yv6cg,2.0,t1_d2yu2xu,1480.0,birding

What I usually do is write in the notes when I first make the eBird entry that there were a few birds I could not identify and would like to update the checklist with them later.

2) If I do register the rental car's plate with Sunpass, but then forget to un-register it as soon as I drop the car off, then my Sunpass will get billed for the next renter's tolls.  Since they might rent the same car out again while I'm still on the plane, I really would have to remember to do it right when I get back to the airport and drop off the car, before I board the plane.

Is that what you're saying?

551,"* Level 1, ""to bust"" - One of the definitions is ""to raid or search (premises where illegal activity is suspected)"".  This is kinda true but misleading; to bust means to catch someone doing something not allowed and expose it or charge them or punish them for it.  While raiding or searching can be a form of bust, it's not necessarily that - you can ""get busted"" just by someone telling on you.  Also, it doesn't have to be illegal, just something not allowed that you were trying to hide.  For example, if someone cheats on their spouse, and one of their spouse's friends sees it and tells their spouse, that's busting them, just as much as a police raid on a drug dealing house is.

* Level 1, ""How are you fixed with money?"" - I've never heard or read this expression anywhere.  Maybe someone from the UK would recognize it?  But it can't be very common, even if it is real.

* Level 1, ""A-Train"" - ""NYC subway service"".  From this, you would think that A-Train is a name for the NYC subway service as a whole.  It's actually just one of many lines.  It's one of the most important lines in the system, yes, but nobody says ""A-Train"" to refer to NYC subway service in general.  It means that specific line.

* Level 2, ""brass"" - ""dough, money OR a decorative object"".  I don't recognize this either.  I don't think I ever hear people refer to money as ""brass"", nor do I recall seeing it in any books or articles or blog posts or anything.

* Level 3, ""spray-on trousers"" - This is another one I don't recognize at all.  Never seen it before, never heard it before, as far as I recall.

* Level 3, ""ridiculous"" - ""extravagantly humorous"" - *very* misleading.  Yes, you *can* refer to something very very funny as ""ridiculous"", but a) ridiculous does not imply humorous at all; most ridiculous things are not funny, and b) if something is ""extravagantly humorous"", while you *might* say ridiculous, most people probably wouldn't.  It's far from the first term that comes to mind, or even the second or third.

* Level 4, ""Let's shake on it."" - The definition is ""Let's shake hands"", which is silly.  When someone says ""let's shake on it"", what they mean is ""okay, we're agreed!  let's shake hands to signify that we have made an agreement and we both pledge to stick to it.""  That's what makes the difference between just ""shake hands"", and to shake (hands) **""on it""** - ""it"" refers to the agreement.  The definition in the course strips all the meaning out of the phrase.

* Level 4, ""to butt in"" - Gives two definitions: ""to hit or push against with the head or horns; to interfere"".  The first one is just plain wrong; it's actually the definition of ""to butt"" (without ""in"").  To ""butt in"" *always* means to interfere or force your way into something or get yourself involved in something, usually with the implication that you're not welcome or weren't invited to participate.

What I would suggest, regardless of gender, is to get to know people casually in situations of mutual interest - a friend of a friend at a party, someone at a professional conference - without expecting to date any of them, but just get to know lots of people a little bit and stay a bit in touch, and try to notice who's being slightly flirty.  If you notice someone maybe being flirty, and you're interested in them, suggest casual get together, again without assumption, just to guage how your dynamic is.  If it goes in a flirty direction, get some practice being flirty, and if you feel good about how it feels, then later you can ask them if they'd like to go on a date.

Did you do that knowingly, or are you just spouting stuff in line with your pre-existing bias without actually knowing what you're talking about?

It's true that the UK is planning to introduce a voter ID requirement, supposedly to go into effect by 2019.  They also plan to introduce free IDs along with that.  We don't know for sure whether this requirement will go into effect, or what effects it will have if it does, but I don't think you were talking about things that European countries will do in the future.

Germany (your second link) does charge for an ID, but that acts more like a tax than a deterrent to getting ID, for a few reasons.  First of all, everyone living in Germany is *required* to have an ID, and it's used for lots of stuff, so everyone has one.  Requiring an ID that everyone already has, in order to vote, obviously doesn't depress turnout or present a lot of difficulty for voters.  Secondly, of course, it's much easier to get.  Parents are allowed to apply for the ID on behalf of their newborn children, for example, so you can start life with an ID you haven't even acquired or paid for yourself.

As I already said in my earlier comment, **IF** the US were to introduce a national ID system similar to what most countries with voter ID requirements have, then voter ID requirements would not serve the purpose Republicans are using them for: to make voting more difficult and reduce the number of poor, minority, and young voters.  Which is why those who push voter ID requirements in the US never try to couple them with systems like that, that would ensure everyone has the proper ID.

http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/01/ted-cruz-jerk-hated

&gt; A prominent aide to George W. Bush's 2000 campaign could barely contain himself when we asked him to discuss Cruz, who worked in the campaign's policy shop. This person described Cruz as hyper-arrogant and widely despised, and he emphasized—over and over—that the pervasive dislike of Cruz within the Bush ranks had nothing to do with ideology. (Cruz, he noted, never objected to Bush's call for compassionate conservatism, immigration reform, and national education standards, and no one on the campaign regarded him as an ideologue.) The problem was simple: his personality.


http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/why-dc-hates-ted-cruz/426915/

&gt; But a Republican policy expert close to a number of top GOP operatives and donors insisted it's not about Cruz's style or his positions. It's his disingenuousness-and inability to produce results. ""He knows his tactics are bound to fail, but pursues them to debase his Republican colleagues under false pretenses and endear himself to the base as the only authentic conservative,"" said the expert

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/19/ted-cruz-at-princeton-creepy-sometimes-well-liked-and-exactly-the-same.html

&gt; In addition to Mazin and Leitch, several fellow classmates who asked that their names not be used described the young Cruz with words like ""abrasive,"" ""intense,"" ""strident,"" ""crank,"" and ""arrogant."" Four independently offered the word ""creepy,"" with some pointing to Cruz's habit of donning a paisley bathrobe and walking to the opposite end of their dorm's hallway where the female students lived.

&gt; ""I would end up fielding the [girls'] complaints: 'Could you please keep your roommate out of our hallway?'"" Mazin says.

571,"Trump did well in the Republican primary by:

a) Being good at getting attention in a race where there were so many candidates, they all had to struggle to be really noticed.  Being able to stand out from the crowd as the one who gets a lot of press coverage, worked wonders for him.

b) Winning a bunch of pluralities in states that gave all their statewide delegates to the statewide winner and/or all of a congressional district's delegates to that district's winner, even if that winner got significantly less than a majority.  Get 30% of the vote, get 100% of the delegates.  (note that in Democratic primaries, even a majority won't get you everything; win 60% of the vote in a state, you get roughly 60% of the delegates)

c) Saying and doing lots of things that really piss off most of the country but strongly appeal to a portion of the Republican party.  Not a majority - even now that his only remaining opponents are really weak, he's just barely getting a majority of the remaining vote.  Just, enough to be ahead of everyone else.

None of that will work the same way in the much larger general election.

Republican primary voters are a minority, and he's the weakest Republican nominee in a very long time even among that minority.  By this time in the primaries, every past Republican nominee-to-be in many decades had already locked up a solid majority both of delegates and of support among Republicans.  Trump has done neither yet.  He still has a good shot at getting a majority of delegates, mainly due to point **b** above, but it'll be closer than any past Republican primary winners in the age of the modern primary system.

So,

a) In the general election, there will be two major party nominees, and both of the will get *loads* of attention from the press and the public.  Being good at standing out from the crowd by grabbing the public's attention with outrageous things won't be necessary or relevant.  Both nominees are guaranteed our full attention; it's what they do with it that counts.

b) It's a two-candidate race.  You can't divide and conquer to win a bunch of states with significantly less than half the vote, because you have a bunch of opponents who are too similar to each other and their supporters can't choose one to all vote for.   He'd have to actually beat Clinton in a state to get that state's electoral votes.

c) He's pissed off a majority of the country, a lot.  Most of them weren't ever going to vote in the Republican primary anyway, but this is the general election, where Republican primary voters are a small minority.  All those things he did to appeal to ~2/5th of Republican primary voters, have caused a majority of general election voters to loathe him.  Trump has a worse approve/disapprove rating nationally than *any* major party nominee has ever had during the general election, since polls tracking that began (well before I was born).

With immigrants, the problem is people hating on immigrants.  People try to justify hating on them - and causing disruptions to their lives or being violent to them or etc., - by claiming that immigrants do bad things.  In reality, some percentage of the population as a whole do bad things and among immigrants it's about the same.  Or, to put it in your terms, nobody's saying ""immigrants don't steal"", what we're saying is ""non-immigrants and immigrants steal at the same rates; natives don't steal any less than immigrants.""  What this means is, these justifications are nonsense; not only do they not justify anything, but they're based on false premises.

With ""people in tech"", which you're using as a stand-in for men in tech it seems, the issue is *not* that they're being harassed out of the industry or having their lives disrupted.  The issue is that *women* are being harassed out of the industry and having their lives disrupted.  What justifies that?

Instead of looking at that, you flip it around, and pretend the question should be ""what justification is there for hating on 'people in tech'"" - as if those people are being unfairly harassed and damaged in some major way, and the main justification for it is that they are attacking women.  You then demolish this strawman by saying, hey, most of them do *not* attack women, so there's no justification for hurting them or drumming them out of their jobs.

Well you know what?  Nobody's drumming those innocents out of their jobs, or threatening their lives, or any of this other stuff.  You've just deftly turned attention away from the actual problem, which is that that stuff *is* happening to lots and lots of women in tech.  Including a majority of *visible* women in tech.  A woman in tech who speaks at public conferences or blogs about her work or does public stuff like that, is more than 50% likely to be threatened and harassed in a disturbing way.

As a man in tech, I can tell you that this does not happen to us.  We feel safe participating in public, without even having to consider it.  So yeah, sure, perhaps a majority of us aren't attacking women, but so what?  It's not like we're being attacked based on the false premise that we all attack women.  We're not.  We don't need anyone's defense.  What we need to do is come to women's defense, or we'll keep losing all of them from our field.

Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with the last part, it remains true that your comment has twisted the matter to make it look like the immigrant and women-in-tech examples are parallel when they're actually opposites, and based on that you set up an implied strawman.",2016-04-26 16:20:47+00:00,d2i2tdi,4.0,t1_d2hkkh1,40937.0,technology

I'm not so certain.  He might get the nomination, but it seems unlikely he'll have it locked up from the primaries.  If he's close, then winning on the first ballot would require convincing some of the unpledged delegates to vote for him, which could be tough.  If he's not close, he won't win on the first ballot, and then his chances are pretty low because most of the delegates - even those bound to vote for him on the first ballot based on primary results - oppose him.  Mostly it seems they're Cruz people, though there are probably a lot of anyone-but-Trump and establishment (Rubio/Bush/etc.) people too.

594,"Ahh, for a house race, there's plenty to do for anyone.  What are your skills?

If you want to learn what campaigns do, being on one is a great way to do that!  A US house race is likely to have several full time staff at least, and hopefully a lot of volunteers.

The candidate themself will probably spend nearly all their time either fundraising or talking to voters - which can be at events, or door to door, or doing press interviews.  Ideally the candidate would spend all their time talking to voters, but with our screwed up privatized campaign funding system, they've gotta spend lots of their time calling people for money.  That's actually one of the biggest problems with privatized campaign funding that most people don't think about - how deeply it cuts into the time that politicians spend meeting or talking to voters when they campaign.  By trading so much of that for fundraising time, it means they disproportionately meet or talk with people with money (who may or may not be voters from their district, but who definitely exclude the majority of voters from their district).

Some of the things campaigns need to do:

- Messaging.  Develop the campaign's message, do polling (usually they commission polls rather than do it themselves, it's a very specialized skill) to figure out the effectiveness of elements of the message, get the message out to the press, develop campaign materials such as flyers that promote the message, etc.

- Candidate and event scheduling and logistics.

- Fundraising and finance.  What the candidate raises on their own won't be enough, so raise money in other ways too.  Money needs to be tracked and budgeted.  Reports need to be filed for transparency and compliance.

- Web/online/social media - this is part messaging, part fundraising, part volunteer recruitment.

- Volunteer coordination and recruitment.  Finding people, getting them in, organizing who will do what, feeding them, training them, following up so they'll come back.

- Field.  This is the biggest in terms of people-time.  Figure out, from the voter file, which voters are most likely worth reaching out to.  Find those voters, either in person at their doors or on the phone or some other way.  Find out which of them will support the candidate, and keep track of that.  When election gets near, remind each of those identified supporters to vote, repeatedly, until they either do vote or the election's over (this last part is what you've probably heard of as ""GOTV"", ""get out the vote"").

595,"It depends a lot on what sort of office you're asking about; while there's one presidential election (with maybe 10-20 candidates at most), there are approximately tens of thousands of other elections every couple of years in the US, the large majority of them in much smaller districts such as counties, towns, or even individual city wards.  Those work very very differently!

It also depends on whether you're asking how *campaigns* work, or what the politicians running for office do, themselves, while campaigning.  The higher the level of office, the larger the district, the more this diverges.  Someone running for Governor or US Senate in a large state, for example, is directly involved only in a very very small part of what their campaign is doing; someone running for city councilor, on the other hand, may not even have any staff or full time volunteers and may be doing a majority of the campaign work themselves.

606,"Are you planning to make a vocabulary course, or going to try to make an actual language course?  The latter takes a lot more time and thought.  Maybe you could start with just a vocab course to get used to course creation.

One really handy trick that many course creators don't know about, and that's useful for plain vocab courses, is to add a third column for synonyms or other meanings (depending on your testing direction).

For example, say you were making a German vocab course for English speakers.  By default, the non-attribute columns you'd use might be, prompt with: German; test on: English.  That means people would see a German word and have to type the English word.

What if there's a German word that has two different meanings that have different English words, and you want people to learn both?  Some ways courses do this:

1. Have two different course items, both with the same German word, one for each English word.  But when you see the German word during a review, you don't know which English word it wants, and have a 50/50 chance of getting it wrong.  *Avoid this!!*

2. Same as above, but with hints on each word.  So instead of the same identical German word for both items, you get the German word with something in parentheses after it, hinting at which meaning is the right one here.  It's hard to do with well without giving too much away and preventing people from learning - if you hint, then they'll get it right even when they haven't really learned it, memrise will be fooled into thinking they know it better than they actually do, and schedule reviews too far into the future.

3. Use alts on the English column, so that the same German word will accept either English word as correct.  Problem is, some people may learn one meaning and forget the other, and then they'll never learn the other meaning.  Each time they see that German word, they'll enter the English meaning they remember, get it right, and move on.

There's a better way: Add a third column called something like ""Other Meaning"".  Have two items in the course for the same German word, one for each English equivalent, and for each one, put the *other* English word in the third column.  Like this:

1: German=a English=b Other Meaning=c

2: German=a English=c Other Meaning=b

When #2 comes up for review, the user sees German word a.  If they type English word c as the answer, it gets marked correct.  If they type English word b as the answer, memrise says ""You entered the Other Meaning but the course wanted the English"" (paraphrased), it does *not* get marked wrong, and they get to try again on the same one.",2016-04-13 17:42:52+00:00,d21f5h1,1.0,t3_4de6op,750432.0,memrise

634,"You're confusing two different things.

In states that hold presidential preference caucuses (such as Iowa or Nevada), they generally hold precinct-level caucuses to elect delegates to county or congressional district caucuses, which then elect delegates to go to the state convention, where they elect delegates to the national convention.

In a few states, they have a hybrid caucus system as you describe, where people just cast ballots at the initial level rather than hold real caucuses.  I know Hawaii does this, and I think Michigan and maybe Minnesota do too?  But very few states do this.  Hawaii is actually different in that they're really holding a primary, but having the party administer it, so they call it a caucus.  People there vote for presidential candidates directly, not delegates

However, a far larger number of delegates are allocated by *primaries*, administered by the state.  New Hampshire, Massachusetts, California, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and on and on - pretty much all the big states and most of the medium states plus some of the small states.  In states that hold primaries, they allocate a number of *national* delegates to each campaign based on the primary vote.  They then hold congressional district caucuses to select who those individual delegates will be, and these are separated by campaign.  Each campaign's people caucus together to select delegates to fill the number of slots that has been allocated to their candidate.  This is a key difference between Democratic and Republican primaries, and it ensures that the pledged delegates coming from Democratic primaries are genuine supporters of their candidates (unlike in Republican primaries, where this year most of them probably aren't).",2016-04-07 22:21:48+00:00,d1u5zm8,6.0,t1_d1u5hwx,712.0,Ask_Politics

639,"That's half the explanation, and it's misleading by omission.

If Sanders doesn't overtake Clinton in pledged delegates, she will get a majority on the first ballot at the convention, and be the nominee.

Cruz and Kasich cannot overtake Trump in pledged delegates, *but* Trump seems unlikely to get enough bound delegates to win a majority on the first ballot.  Therefore, if he doesn't convince enough unbound delegates to vote for him on the first ballot to give him &gt;50%, then nobody will win on the first ballot.  That seems a very likely outcome at this point.  Once that happens, most of the delegates become unbound and free to vote for who they want, and there are a lot of good reasons to believe that most of them don't want Trump, and that more of them are Cruz supporters than supporters of any other candidate.  So Cruz (and maybe Kasich) do have reasonable shots at winning, and they do *not* need to overtake Trump in bound delegates - they just need to keep him from getting &gt;50%.

In other words, Sanders at this point is much much more of a long shot than Cruz.  Sanders would need to beat Clinton and he is too far behind to do it.  Cruz (and maybe Kasich) just need to keep Trump from getting 50%, and their odds of doing that are very good (though not certain).",2016-04-06 22:51:48+00:00,d1ssdrs,2.0,t1_d1s275e,34458.0,Ask_Politics

Now, that's not actually true for the Republican convention - there are a few states whose rules bind delegates for more than just the first ballot.  On the second ballot, some delegates are still bound but most are not.  By the fourth ballot I believe all delegates are unbound.

For the Democratic convention, I'm pretty sure every delegate becomes free to vote for whoever they want on the second ballot, but:

a) In a two-candidate race, someone will get a majority on the first ballot, so it doesn't matter.

641,"For many people, the ideas of ""commitment"" and monogamy are deeply intertwined from culture and upbringing, and they don't realize it.  To them, ""dating around"" or ""playing the field"" are things you do while you're still trying to find the right partner; once you pick that partner for life, then you stop dating or having sex with anyone else - that's part of making the choice, that you no longer have to try out various different people (a pre-cursor to choosing one).

However, these people generally *do* know what commitment actually means, if you get them to unpack it.  With family members who you love and who are important to you, it's worth taking the time to do that.

Ask them to describe what commitment means to *them* - not just being sexually exclusive, but everything else.  Really listen to them wax poetic about commitment, what's great about it, what it has meant in their lives.  As you listen, take mental notes, and remember everything they say that applies to your view of commitment.  Then ask if they'd like to hear from you about how you see your relationships, and when they say yes (which seems likely), mirror back to them a lot of what they just said to you, in their own language, but modified to be about you and your relationships.  By doing so, you can show them a vision of commitment that omits monogamy, but still has a lot of what they consider important about commitment.

I live in a state that voted well before this reddit post.  If you're somewhere that hasn't voted yet, you should definitely vote for him!  The more states he keeps on winning, the stronger a position he'll be in to get Clinton to take his proposals seriously and agree to some of them, to get the convention to highlight his speech and his platform positions, and to hopefully get some influence on who gets appointed in the Clinton administration.

But there's no way he's winning the nomination unless some big unexpected thing happens, like Clinton gets cancer and drops out, or a surprise scandal erupts and dominates the news, or something like that.  Through normal campaigning, no matter how well he does it and how well we do it, as long as Clinton keeps up what she's doing, she has the nomination.

I'm pretty sure you didn't even read my analysis of the delegate numbers because you just don't want to know the facts.  Clinton is still up by more than 200 pledged delegates now, after several of Sanders' best states have voted.  He can gain significantly from Oregon, and possibly also gain some from Wisconsin and a few others, but he cannot close that 200+ gap down to 0.  It's just too much.

Clinton is going to be smart enough to make the concessions Sanders requires for him to endorse her, and he will endorse her, just as Elizabeth Warren will.  What those concessions are going to be is partly up to how well Sanders does in remaining primaries, though he's already done well enough that as long as he doesn't entirely collapse (highly unlikely), he'll get something significant.

Once that happens, those people who actually believe in Warren and what she wants to achieve, will also support Clinton for the general election.  People who were just in it for symbolism and cynicism rather than to get anything done, may stick with ""I hate Clinton"" and sulk out the election.

1. Long lines and scarce polling places were, according to what I've read, more common issues in heavily hispanic areas.  We think hispanic voters on balance vote for Clinton more than Sanders, so this might have helped Sanders.

2. Clinton gets the core of her support from longtime Democrats, Sanders draws a lot more infrequent voters and independents.  Since this was a closed primary, people had to register as Democrats before the deadline to be allowed to vote.  A lot of people who did that say that when they showed up at the polls, they found that their registration was not updated and they couldn't vote.

683,"Technically, yes.  Practically, not really.

Superdelegates are delegates.  To win the nomination, a candidate needs to get a majority of all delegates voting at the convention - that includes pledged delegates and superdelegates, all of them vote.

Since there are 4765 total delegates, 2383 is just over 50% and that's why that's the ""required"" count to win.

However, if one candidate won a majority of pledged delegates, but superdelegates voted in greater numbers for the other candidate and gave them the nomination, it would be a scandal.  Lots of people would view it as the convention illegitimately stealing the nomination from the candidate who won the primaries.  People would feel cheated, like they didn't actually lose fairly, they won and had it taken away unfairly.  The party would not unite behind the nominee.  The nominee would probably lose the election in November.

Superdelegates are party leaders.  More than who the nominee is, they care that their party win the presidency.  They will not allow this scandal to happen.  If the candidate with fewer superdelegates wins a majority of pledged delegates, enough superdelegates will declare support for that candidate - even if it means switching their previously declared support - to ensure that the pledged delegate winner gets the nomination.

So in *real* terms, what a candidate needs to win the nomination is a majority of pledged delegates.  There are 4051 pledged delegates; 2026 is a majority of that.  Whichever candidate gets 2026 pledged delegates, will get the nomination.  That's the number you need to watch.  Do not be fooled by the 2383 and the superdelegate counts - those are effectively just a technicality and don't matter.",2016-03-24 17:26:17+00:00,d1bzzpd,1.0,t3_4bozj6,66313.0,Ask_Politics
684,"Turnout in the primary depends more than anything else on how competitive the primary is seen as being - that is, how close the contest seems.  Secondly, it depends on number of candidates, because each campaign draws more voters who might not have otherwise voted, and has field offices and people going door to door and stuff.

Republicans have had multiple candidates all the way through, and still have three active candidates now.  Democrats have only really had two the whole time, though technically O'Malley was running until Iowa.

As far as competitive, in the Democratic primary most people initially assumed Clinton would win, and after a bit of excitement when Sanders turned out stronger than those people expected, it has now settled down into a contest Clinton is expected to win because she has a large delegate lead.  Meanwhile, in the Republican primary, nobody knew what to expect at first, and any number of candidates seemed to be in the running.  Now, even though the race has stabilized, it still looks likely that Trump won't get an actual majority of delegates, but he does have a chance, so it's still a really close race with the outcome unknown.

Democrats

* 50% of a state's delegate allocation is proportional to the percentage of the total vote cast for recent *Democratic* presidential candidates came from that state.  In other words, if you imagine a ""population"" made up only of people who voted for the Democrat for president in the past few elections, the state gets delegates proportional to its share of that population.

* States get bonus delegates (calculated as a percentage of their base allocation) for holding their primaries later than March, and additional bonus delegates (also as a percentage) if they hold their primaries in clusters of adjacent states voting the same day.

Republicans:

* Base delegate allocation is 10 + 3 x number of US Representatives

* After Super Tuesday, http://cos.livejournal.com/136752.html

* After he won Michigan, http://cos.livejournal.com/137103.html

Hillary Clinton's lead is around 300 pledged delegates now.  California, one of the last states to vote (June 7th), has 475 pledged delegates.  So obviously it's still mathematically possible for him to win.  For example, if he breaks even with her until California and then wins 100% of the vote in California, he'll be 175 pledged delegates ahead!  But is that a realistic possibility?  Obviously not.

However, as long as he keeps running, there's always the off chance that something big and unexpected will happen.  Maybe there will be some huge scandal we haven't had any hints of yet.  Maybe Clinton will have a sudden health problem and decide she can't be president.  Very very unlikely, but not literally *impossible*.  But that's the only way he can still win.

Why hasn't he dropped out?  Well, partly to still be in a position to pick up the pieces if Clinton stumbles badly.  But partly because his campaign can accomplish a lot even if he doesn't win, and the longer he keeps it going and the closer he is to Clinton, the better.  He's showing that the side of the Democratic party that supports him is powerful and real and can mobilize a lot of voters, and that gives this side of the party a lot more influence than if he weren't running.

722,"If you are the creator or a maintainer of the course, you can add *short* examples that will flash for a couple of seconds on the screen after someone gives a correct answer.

To do that, add a regular column to the database, not an attribute.  This column will be neither the ""prompt with"" nor the ""test on"" column.  Check the ""always show"" checkbox on that column (or edit an existing column and check that checkbox).  The description for ""always show"" is misleading, because it makes you think this column will be displayed during a review before the user types the answer - it will not.  Therefore, it's fine to put spoilers and giveaway hints in this column.  What ""always show"" actually means is that this column will be displayed on the *learning* screen for each row.

Only the *first* column marked ""always show"" will flash on the screen after someone types a correct answer.

For example, your course might have these four columns:

1. German

2. English

3. Example sentence [always show]

4. Part of speech [attribute column, show at tests]

Now if you have a level set to Prompt with: German, Test on: English, then the learning screens will show colums 1 through 3.  #1 because it's the prompt-with column, #2 because it's the test-on column, and #3 because it's ""always show"".  In addition, #4 (part of speech) will also appear on the learning screen if you have ""show attributes"" set on your database.

When someone is reviewing, they'll see a word from the German column.  Below that word they will also see the part of speech, because ""show at tests"" is set on that column.  They have to enter the English.  When they do, and hit enter, if they got it right, then the value of the ""Example sentence"" will flash on the screen for a couple of seconds - but *only if it's short*!  Sadly memrise gives you no control over that length.  They say it's limited to 20 characters but in my experience it's often longer.

762,"No.  It's not hyperbole.

You *can* occasionally learn a little bit about what may happen in a state in the general election from primary results, but it rarely has anything to do with the winning candidate in the primary being somehow necessarily better able to win that state in the general.  That's just 100% fictitious in the general case.  Yeah I could imagine specific scenarios where that's true, but I can just as easily imagine plenty of scenarios where the opposite is true - the candidate winning a state in the primary being far far less likely to win it in the general.

Clinton, for example, is getting almost all of her support in primaries from committed and reliable Democratic voters.  Whoever's voting for Clinton in a primary today, you can pretty much bet that they will turn out in the general election, and they will vote for the Democratic nominee, whoever it is.  So all those Clinton voters that help her win any particular state tonight, they'd be equally helping Sanders win that state in November if he gets the nomination.  So what can you conclude about which of them is more likely to win that state merely from the fact that she won it today?  Nothing, absolutely nothing.  At all.

That's just one example.  But again, not hyperbole. In the general case, there is **NO** correlation you can infer from who won the primary to who's more likely to win the general.  In *specific* cases you can infer a correlation - sometimes a *negative one!* - but you have to understand why it makes sense in that case and be able to explain the specific factors you're looking at that make you read the primary results that way in that particular election for that particular state.",2016-03-02 02:26:15+00:00,d0k7ab7,6.0,t1_d0k5evu,2685.0,boston

&gt; 
&gt; Shouldn't Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida be more important? 

No, there's no connection between those things.  You're very very confused.  A candidate who wins the primary in a particular state doesn't show they'll win that state in the general, in which a large number of other voters are voting.  Just because one Democrat or another wins a Democratic primary in Ohio doesn't tell us that Democrat is more or less likely to win the Ohio in the general election.  The connection you're trying to draw is utterly meaningless.

Why does Massachusetts matter?  Well, partly because it has a larger number of delegates than similarly-sized states, because delegates to the DNC are based in part on how many people in the state voted for the Democrat in past presidential elections.

But much more importantly, because it's seen as a way to figure out how well Bernie Sanders will do in future primaries.  It's the sort of state that he's supposed to be able to win.  If he does not win here, people will re-evaluate how well he can do in other states he's expected to do well in in the future.  And it will become a big story in the media, one way or another - something that could heavily influence how people vote in primaries coming up.  If people think he's doing well and has a good shot, they're more likely to vote for him; if people think his candidacy is doomed they're less likely to do so.

769,"&gt; A narrow win vs narrow loss in a state award closer amounts of delegates than a narrow win vs a huge win. Every vote counts in a way that they don't in the general election, since every incremental vote contributes towards winning an incremental delegate.

Well, sort of.  As this article explains, in many cases a congressional district has an even number of delegates, so the difference between a narrow win and a narrow loss in that district is actually nothing, and it takes a very big win (63%) to get more delegates than the losing candidate.  In Massachusetts, we have 4 congressional districts with even splits (6 delegates each) and 5 districts with odd (7 delegates each).  More importantly, we have an even number of statewide delegates: 32.  Those are the ones awarded proportionally based on statewide results, and in the case of a narrow loss or narrow win, they'll go 16-16.

However, the symbolic importance of a narrow loss vs. narrow win, and how it affects the press coverage, which in turn will affect how people in future primaries vote, will probably be very big.  The expectation that has been set - and it's fairly reasonable - is that Clinton wins southern states and Bernie wins northeastern states.  But if Clinton wins Massachusetts, a lot of the story will be about how Clinton can beat him even in his stronghold in the northeast.

They found that in Georgia, where white voters are very very skewed towards Republicans, there's a Republican advantage even among whites with more education - but it's a *smaller* advantage than Republicans have with less-educated white voters.

Sabato said, ""The higher the education level, the more likely they are to vote Democratic."" So if you pretend that what Sabato meant was ""they're more likely to vote Democratic than vote Republican"" - that is, more highly educated whites would vote for Democrats at a greater percentage than for Republicans - that's not quite true for Georgia, though it's true nationally and in Virginia.

But that's obviously not what he meant.  His statement, if you want to make it more complete, would be something like ""The higher the education level, the more likely they are to vote Democratic than those at lower education levels.""

Every candidate has a ""stump speech"" which they deliver parts of at nearly every public appearance.  Very few candidates, however, deliver the very same section of their stump speech multiple times at the same event, nearly word-for-word and with identical intonation.  That's what drew people's attention to Rubio's debate weirdness - it was so *weird*.

But there's more to it than the repetition.  Rubio seems to have difficulty actually giving responses and staying on topic.  Most candidates, even when staying on message, can field a question or engage in a debate by giving a response that seems relevant and seems to address what was said.  Or, in Sanders' case, that *actually* is relevant and *actually* addresses what was said.

What Rubio is doing reminds me of John Edwards on the stump back in 2004.  I saw him several times, and it was eerie how scripted and formulaic he seemed.  But he did it in a way that didn't show as obviously at a single event, and he could speak off the cuff somewhat too.

Do you realize how ridiculous that sounds?  You're expecting all of us to assume that every single employee of the Federal governmet ""has power"" and every single other person not employed by the Federal government ""doesn't have power"", that power is a binary state and it's given to all Federal employees fully and to everyone else not at all.

&gt; I don't believe in using force against other sentient creatures unless they are directly threatening another. Government action is force.

In my view, that's a twisted and implausible kind of ""morality"" that's blind to what coercion and freedom actually means, not to mention what ""threatening"" means (someone taking your property, for example, is not ""directly threatening"" you; someone who cheats you financially is most certainly not ""directly threatening"" you no matter matter how dastardly the fraud).

It seems completely divorced from reality, and the only way I can explain it is in my mind is as a rationalization for wanting to believe dislike the idea of government.  It doesn't seem ""moral"" to me in any sense that I recognize as being actually about morality.  I'm flabbergasted that some people believe this ideology counts as ""morality"", though I recognize that such people (such as you) do exist.  But it's wholly immoral by any moral standard I recognize.

&gt; My experiences in dealing directly with the government (in many different ways at different points in my life) have left their mark on me, in a way that puts me outside the mainstream. I simply cannot and will not trust it to do what is best.

For example, basic scientific research in many fields can be very expensive, yet when discoveries are made, the financial benefits will be spread throughout society.  Rarely will the scientists or research labs who paved the way to the discoveries get much of the financial benefit directly.  By having government pay for basic research, we vastly expand the economic rewards to society, which end up being orders of magnitude greater than the amount spent - but much of it was spent on things that private investors would've had little or no financial motivation to invest in.  Private investors aren't in the business of creating broad-based wealth for all of society when only a small portion of it goes to them; they'd lose all their money if they focused on that.

810,"&gt; See, I think the ""woo-woo unrealistic idealistic wishful thinking"" is to believe that you can trust the people in power. If you concentrate power in the hands of a few people and let them control every aspect of peoples' lives, you're increasing the chances that a single bad actor among those few can destroy a large number of people

You've made a big leap from the fact that government is effective (a solidly proven fact, over and over) to assuming that government must mean concentrating power in few hands while your preferred ways of attempting to ineffectually achieve the same ends does *not* concentrate power in few hands.

Again, reality contradicts your ideology.  These are two separate things.  How centralized or decentralized your power structure is, is not the same thing as whether you harness government to achieve public good effectively or deride government and try to ineffectually do it through private action.  Either extreme can go with either strategy.

Feudalism, the Gilded Age, and today's concentration of tremendous power in the hands of a few wealthy people, all show that concentrated power - and the risk of massive destruction that comes from it - is not just a risk with government.  Furthermore, the progressive era and new deal in American politics, and a number of European governments of the present, demonstrate that government can often be the most effective counterweight *against* excessive centralization of power.  The entire American system of government was designed, with elections and checks &amp; balances, to forestall excess concentration of power.  While that hasn't worked perfectly, history shows us that the biggest risk in the American system has been not when government concentrates power too much, but when government gets too weak and fails to prevent the inevitable forces of excess concentration of power in the private sector - which is a much bigger threat to all of our livelihoods and freedoms.

&gt; I absolutely understand what you're saying - modern Western societies aren't necessarily in a place where we can rely purely on volunteers to be charitable enough to care for everyone who needs aid. I want that to change. 

You do not understand what I'm saying.  What I'm saying is that your desire for that to change is a woo-woo idealistic wishful pipe dream that is impossible without harnessing government to accomplish the goals.  You *want* that to change but there is no evidence on earth that suggests what you want is realistic.  Furthermore, there's no *reason* for it.  Government is exactly how we accomplish these sorts of things.  Your ideological desire to not use government has no objective moral reason nor practical reason, it's just something you want.  There's no good reason for any of the rest of us to want it.  When we know how to provide the aid and infrastructure that people need, and a bunch of people say ""no don't do it that way, I've got another way!"" and we know that other way doesn't work, why shouldn't we keep trying to do it the way we know does work?  Just because you wish your other way would work?  No.

&gt; When you get aid from a government bureaucrat instead of a community member who cares about you as a person, it's demoralizing.

Here you've just devolved into out and out insanity.  I don't even know what to say to that fantastic and incredibly crazy assertion.  I guess I'll just point out that even you can think about it and realize how many people, out of pride, refuse help from anyone they know and feel tremendously ashamed if they have to accept such help, but do not avoid government help.

It's just totally off the wall.

Romans had a word for ""cat"" of their own, ""felis"", but they borrowed the predecessor of the word we use today from the Egyptians.  I think it was probably of Egyptian origin.

Although the Romans ruled Great Britain for quite a while, the native Britons incorporated very very Latin words into their language, but cat was one of them.

When the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes took over and displaced the Britons from most of the land, they formed a language out of their various very-similar Germanic languages.  They picked up very very few words from the Britons.  But cat was one of them.

English got lots and lots of words from old Norse after the vikings conquered a portion of Great Britain and the two societies coexisted and traded with each other for a long time.  Cat was not displaced.

Later, the Norman conquest brought a host of words from old French into English.  In most cases, where there was a French equivalent for an already existing English word, English ended up with both, with the French word taking on the more extreme or fancier meaning (like ""demand"" from the French word for to ask/request, or ""arrest"" from the French word for stop).  For animals, what tended to happen was that the French word became the word for the food, while the English one remained for the animal.  English, as a Germanic+Norse language, had a mostly parallel set of equivalent words for all of the Latin-derived French words.

But the French word for cat was from the same root as the English!  Because it was from Latin. So we got ""cat"" from both sides (French ""chat"").",2016-01-13 01:21:35+00:00,cyw2iot,1.0,t3_40mcms,44506.0,history

Washington DC has three airports: BWI, Dulles, and National (DCA).  Only National is actually close to the city.  BWI and Dulles are both pretty far out (BWI is actually in Baltimore).  No problem if you're renting a car - consider renting one for a day, it may turn out cheaper than the round trip by cab.  Or, you can get a layover in National and just take public transit.

Whatever you do, Washington DC has high concentration of cool stuff in a small walkable part of the city.  A bunch of the Smithsonian museums, the National Botanical Garden, all of the major monuments, the White House and US Capitol, are all around the National Mall.  If you have a limited time, like 5-6 hours, to explore a city, DC is a great choice.  You can just go to the national all and walk around and see lots of stuff.  Or you might get distracted in one great museum for your whole visit :)

BTW, don't miss the awesome FDR memorial.  It's not a far walk, but it's tucked away behind a lagoon and some parks a bit away from the other monuments, so you won't run across it unless you look at a map and go find it.

Which is not good, because the economies of urban and suburban areas are very different.

As it is, it could be that the article is hiding from the facts; like, maybe the author saw that minimum wage rises *did* shift jobs away from low wage industries towards other fields, but didn't want to tell us that because it undermined their ideological case.

861,"&gt; Furthermore, at my employer, one of the worlds largest airlines, out of the 100k employees, it is said less than a dozen have access to and know the ticket pricing system intimately. It's one of an airlines most deeply guarded secrets, more so than the Coke or KFC recipes.

To be fair, knowing the ticket pricing system intimately isn't really what you need to get good prices.  And actually, more accurately it's the *availability* system that's the closely guarded secret; fares are public and published.  Problem with fares isn't that they're too secret, it's that they're too complex to understand.  There are so many fares, with so many different rules, that you can combine in a bunch of different ways, that really only a computer can do it.  Fortunately for you the traveler, there are plenty of computers that do just that, and you have access to them on the web through a bunch of web sites.

Availability is the system that decides *which* sets of fares are available for any particular flight &amp; date at any particular moment.  Airlines adjust those formulas very carefully, and keep them very very secret.  But you don't need to know the formulas.  Let's say for example that the ""Y"" class fares offer the lowest prices for the flight you want, and the airline's secret formula has decided to make 44 Y class fares available for that flight on that date.  If 42 of them have been purchased, and you do a search for two tickets, the Y class fare will show up.  Later that day, someone else buys a Y fare for that flight-date, and you search again for 2 tickets, and sorry, Y isn't available anymore, so you get a more expensive fare.

Do you really need to know the airline's formula to work with that?  Of course not.  Even if you did, you wouldn't know exactly when some passenger would buy the last few tickets at that fare, though you might have a fairly good estimate +/- a couple of days.  All you really need to know is that typically, for a specific flight &amp; date, the better fares sell out first, so buy earlier and you get the better prices.

Maybe the airline sells more cheap fares on Wednesdays than on Saturdays.  Do you need to know that their formula does that?  No.  All you need to do is search on hipmunk or Google Flights or Orbits or whatever, for the dates you're interested in, and see whether the flights are cheaper on one date than on another.  You don't need to know the secret formulas, you just need to see the results they give you for the trips you care about.

The ""secret"" to getting good prices is basically:

* Buy your tickets more than a month in advance, before any of the good fares sell out.

* Search and compare - different airlines, different dates, different airports.  Be flexible about your travel dates and times, and a wider variety of fares will be open to you.

* Search both for round trips and separate one way flights.  Sometimes there will be a round trip fare that's cheaper than buying two separate tickets, but this is rare in domestic US travel these days.  Sometimes - and this happens more often than cheap roundtrip fares - the cheapest flight out is on a different airline than the cheapest flight back, and the two airlines don't have an e-ticket agreement so you can't buy the same ticket for both.  Which means that combination of flights won't show up in a round trip search, but you will find it if you search for two separate one way tickets.

* Despite all of the above, yes it is possible that some better deal will suddenly be offered after you already bought your tickets.  But that was probably a decision made by some airline's business team *after* you bought your ticket, so nobody couldn't predicted it.  If you wait and don't buy because you want to see if some better deal comes along, chances are much higher that it won't but that good fares will sell out in the meantime.  So your odds are best to just buy more in advance of no better fares have been published yet.

Edit: All of this is assuming you're *planning* travel.  If you're open to impromptu travel to places you hadn't planned to go, and going on very short notice and/or making snap decisions, then there are a number of quirks out there that you could take advantage of.

a) Some of the most expensive tickets *are* refundable

b) Some people missed the flight due to missed connections that are the airline's fault, so they will fly on a different flight without paying any extra, which means effectively their ticket on this flight has been fully refunded to pay for the one they're actually taking

c) Since airlines *know* some people won't show up, they can sell more tickets by putting a few extra passengers on the plane, and this lets them lower the cheapest-ticket price for *everyone* - which allows them to sell a few more to people who might otherwise not have flown, or have picked a different airline.",2016-01-10 15:55:38+00:00,cysxphd,4.0,t1_cyswrwt,2069.0,AskReddit

Totally not true.  When housing prices go up, lots of owners suddenly have more paper wealth.

Others sell their houses but don't necessarily buy replacements as expensive as what they sold, while the new buyers get large mortgages to finance their purchase.

874,"Flawed explanation.  Many people deliberately designate a particular relationship as ""primary"" as a choice, not merely a description.  But that doesn't mean they necessarily have vetos, or rules about always spending the night together, or strict limitations on other relationships.

It's essentially the same category of designation as, for some people, is deciding that they're in a ""Relationship"" rather than merely FWBs / seeing each other / casually dating.  For many people, that is an explicit choice, that carries with it intent to have and construct a certain kind of relationship with someone.  It's not necessarily about limitations on other relationships (though for monogamous people it always is).

Deciding to make a relationship primary can mean no more than deciding ""if a conflict arises, the needs of this relationship take precedence for me over the needs of other relationships, to the extent necessary for this relationship.""  And then maybe conflicts don't arise so it never translates to explicit actions.  Or maybe it means if two partners excitedly invite you to visit their family on the same holiday, you go with the primary this time and suggest finding another time to visit your other partner's family.  Priority can manifest in different ways, but that doesn't mean it has to be about rules, or rigidly inflexible, nor does it mean it has to restrict other relationships.

P.S. I don't do relationship hierarchy for my own relationships.  I'm not trying to describe what I do.  I just think this explanation is flawed and misleading.",2016-01-09 21:30:39+00:00,cys5uu7,1.0,t3_405u3x,40462.0,polyamory

879,"Weird, but not bad at all.  It was quite a nice date, just quite unusual.

I'd been talking to this girl online a little bit, after she wrote me out of the blue saying she liked some posts I had made on a polyamory community.  I saw her picture and she looked cute, and she was definitely smart and interesting based on the few messages we exchanged.  But she lived on the west coast, and I on the east, so it was just talk.

Except, shortly after we met, I told her I was roadtripping to a new years party in Kentucky, and she told me she was going to be in Cleveland just before new years - which was right on my way to Kentucky.  Why in Cleveland?  Well, she used to live there with a boyfriend, now ex, and when she moved to Seattle she left a lot of her stuff at his apartment.  They parted amicably and were still friends and he was okay with that.  Except now he was moving out at the end of the year, so she needed to come back up her stuff and ship it to Seattle.  So she was going to be there for a couple of days in late December.

Great!  I was driving out a few days before New Years anyway (staying with friends in Kentucky for a few days for the party), so I could stop by Cleveland, meet her in person, take her out to dinner, and then continue on my way.

Got to her ex-boyfriend's apartment, met them both, it was quite empty by now, late stages of packing.  Most of the furniture gone, stuff in boxes.  She happily took a break from packing and we went out to dinner and it felt like we'd been friends for years, we felt super comfortable with each other.  She told me there was only one bed left at the apartment, that her plan had been to spend the last two nights with the ex (no sex, just same bed), but after doing that the previous night she realized she'd really rather not, and she was also realizing that spending two solid days with him was starting to bug her too... so I suggested I'd find a motel for us for the night and I'd go to Kentucky tomorrow after she flew home.  Which she took me up on.

Dropped her off back at the apartment to do some more packing while I drove off to find a motel near the airport with a vacancy (this was long enough ago that we didn't have Google Maps and all the hotels online, so I wanted to scout out a place).  Found it, picked her up again at the appointed time, and spent a really fun night with her.  Got up waaay too early in the morning to drive her to the airport (especially since we hadn't really slept) and went right back to the motel to sleep a few more hours until checkout time.

When I checked out, realized her big pillow - which we'd brought from the apartment - was still there.  So I took that with me to Kentucky.  Where I ended up hooking up with a different girl several nights in a row.  We met for the first time because we were both staying at the same house, she was there with friends of mine.  We had sort of a 5-day relationship, like we were a couple for the duration of the visit but with no intent to make a relationship out of it.

I did eventually bring that pillow to Seattle though :)

Accidentally left my *own* large pillow in Kentucky.  *That* one got returned to me back at my home on the east coast a couple of months later, by another girl who I met that same week in Kentucky, who I ended up kinda dating long distance for the next year or so.",2016-01-09 04:17:49+00:00,cyrhbmh,1.0,t3_403jg0,19769.0,AskReddit

When people feel so strongly about something that they opt for civil disobedience, and stage a sit-in or something else, and are willing to get arrested and go to jail for their beliefs, I'll pay more attention, and again evaluate what I think of their cause.  If their civil disobedience is for a cause I find abhorrent, I'll be appalled, of course, and if it's for a cause I find right and just, I'll be inspired and supportive.

But that's not what this is about.

Once they decide to arm themselves with guns and threaten to shoot dead anyone who opposes them, that's no longer civil disobedience, let alone ""protest"".  It's no longer a matter of evaluating what I think of their cause, and agreeing or disagreeing.  They've gone over the line, into armed rebellion, and threats of violence.

Acts like that can be necessary for people living in totalitarian states, military dictatorships.  Places where the have no opportunity to organize for the change they want, where they cannot get their ideas out to the public to convince people, where there's no meaningful input into public policy, and where there doesn't seem to be any way to change that without resorting to violence or threats of violence.  In such situations, sometimes armed rebellion may be the right move.

But for these American-white-privileged flamingly reckless assholes to pretend that the USA is *that*, a military dictatorship they must take up arms against, is so far over the line as to throw out all consideration for their cause.  What they're saying is, who cares about the democracy who have, about our freedom of speech and association and ability to organize and push for political change through nonviolent means - they reject all that, and opt for threatening war instead.  They're white men and US citizens; their ability to agitate for change peacefully through the press and democratic process is fully protected.  They simply reject the concept of democracy.

They *were* pronounced differently in ancient Hebrew (and still could be in liturgical/Biblical Hebrew, in services), and their Arabic counterparts still have that difference.

Since only Sephardim (who lived in Arab countries) could pronounce a ""real"" ayin, while the sound had mostly been lost among Ashkenazi Jews (since European languages don't have that sound), they decided not to included it in modern Hebrew.  So ayin just became another aleph, for pronunciation.

918,"&gt; but color recognition isn't like language

I didn't say color recognition is *like language*.  It does, however, bear striking similarity to recognition of *sounds* - and of course what sounds we learn to recognize is derived from what language people around us speak, so there is an indirect relationship there at least.  Which doesn't mean color recognition is ""like"" language, but it is related to language.

What I'm referring to in the latter part of the paragraph is evidence that even today, there still exist cultures with different mental color categorization, which affects their color recognition at least somewhat.  See:

http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb05/hues.aspx

http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=17970

[ My impression is also partly based on trying to learn Hawaiian, and seeing how the color distinctions made in old Hawaiian don't map nicely into the simpler color words given for modern Hawaiian that are intended to map onto English color concepts. It seems like Hawaiians of past centuries didn't lump colors into the same very-broad sets we do, such as ""blue"" and ""green"". What we consider different shades of, say, ""red"", it seems they considered to just be different, separate colors, without one big broad ""red"" word encompassing a bunch of them. ]

I assume you're familiar with that stuff, just putting it here for context about what I'm referring to (and for other readers).  Personally I don't know much about the how the underlying brain functions work (I'm not a brain scientist or anything related to that), just read a lot about the effects/results of those brain functions.

&gt;  Language is cultural communication whereas color is biological observation (ie language interprets the biological observation to others)

Sound recognition is *also* biological observation.  And color is both a perception, a mental concept, and a language for communicating that observation to others - it's all of those things.  Sound recognition and color recognition are quite analogous.  Hearing a sound and recognizing it as ""an R"" is analogous to seeing some light and recognizing it as ""brown"".",2016-01-03 20:43:43+00:00,cykpcz2,7.0,t1_cykovgl,687.0,todayilearned
919,"You're mixing up different concepts.  ""colors"" are inventions of your brain; they're a way your brain interprets the signals coming in from your cones.

Because each cone type's frequency sensitivity peaks at a different wavelength, the hues associated with those cones are associated with those wavelengths, but that's not because those wavelengths have any inherent hue.  If you took all of your blue cones and changed their peak sensitivity to a different wavelength, your brain would start showing you that wavelength as blue.

Tetrachromats, if they really exist, have four different kinds of cones, with four different profiles of wavelength sensitivity.  Their brains would have to effectively invent totally different hues to represent that.  This has absolutely nothing to do with seeing a ""wide spectrum"", or ultraviolet or infrared.  It's like taking your normal hue space and adding another dimension to it.  You would have some different hues that look completely identical to most people, no matter how sensitive they are to subtle differences.

I'm using the word ""hue"" instead of ""color"" because color is a combination of hue and other things, such as lightness/darkness and saturation.  This difference is all about hue.  However, the fact that color includes other dimensions can help you understand what this is about.  Imagine that some people couldn't see how light or dark a color is - if it were the same hue, then it's the same thing to them.  They could not distinguish a dark green from a light green of the exact same hue of green.  Imagine some other people *could* see the darkness-lightness dimension of color, and could tell those colors apart.  Those people could see more colors, without seeing a wider spectrum; they could just see a dimension of color that others could not.

However, if you were in a world where almost nobody could see darkness/lightness, then being able to see those yourself wouldn't help you mix better paints for everyone else, who only cared about hues and saturation because that's all they could see.

P.S. Color is not just what your brain gives you, it's also *cultural*.  So even though you would be seeing hues that the rest of us don't see at all, you would learn to mentally file them within our cultural color categories.  [Read this article](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-blue-and-how-do-we-see-color-2015-2) if you're interested in how color is a culturally constructed concept.  It's similar to sounds of the alphabet, and how ""l"" and ""r"" are different sounds to us but unimportant variations of the same sound to many Asians, even though they can hear the same spectrum of sounds; similarly, we English speakers don't really notice the difference between Welsh aspirated and unaspirated consonants, which they consider to be different sounds and give different names to.  Of course those are differences all of us *can* perceive; this analogy is meant only to explain how colors are cultural concepts in addition to perception, not to explain what having an added dimension of hue is like.",2016-01-03 19:31:10+00:00,cykmgit,5.0,t1_cykm1zx,602.0,todayilearned

I was very direct about what I said.  Articles claiming opposing things does not make a ""debate"".  A debate involves actually addressing what each other said, in both directions.

As I explained above, what I do not see are any articles that show any awareness of the assertion that it's a myth and give an answer or disagree.  The ""it's a myth"" side says that yes, lots of people believe this, but they're wrong, here's what's actually happening.  So of course there are plenty of articles showing that people exist who believe it - that's consistent with the ""it's a myth"" side.

An article explaining *direct* evidence of it could debunk the ""myth"" assertion without any debate, but I haven't found anything like that either, just articles about people saying it without giving any detail about why they believe it.  So that's not enough information to pick a side.  Lacking that, there would at least be a ""debate"" if some article showed some credible source saying ""some people say it is a myth because the trunk stays rooted in one place despite the moving roots, but ___"" and then answered that claim with some other information that directly addresses or contradicts it.  That would be a debate.

Again, if all you have is:

a) Articles quoting people who believe these trees walk, but with no direct details about why they believe it

b) Articles saying ""lots of people believe these trees walk, but it's not true, it's just a commonly-repeated myth; the trunk stays in place even though the roots can move""

... that there is no *debate*.

Also, claim b does seem bit more credible in the absence of any other sorts of articles.  This is because claim a acknowledges and addresses claim b.  If claim a were true then it should be possible to find *either*

c) Articles discussing direct evidence of trees walking, such as a scientist who tracked some trees from one location to another, or even a direct interview with a local non-scientist who explains some credible way they determined an individual tree moved.

OR

d) Articles *showing awareness of the myth assertion* and addressing/debunking/contradicting it.

That's what I asked you for when you said ""debate"".  Can you find d?  I could not in my searches.  Now do you understand?

Asking does not mean I'm asserting these things don't exist.  I'm *asking*.  At first, I thought you were actually aware of some examples of d at least, because you said there was debate.

&gt; Because of that stripe and apparent lack of a dark tail border, I'm inclined to say Striped over Princess

Princess parrotfish have sharp strips as juveniles, which fade and become brown when they mature to initial phase.  So the coloration of this one looks like a princess parrotfish.  Striped, on the other hand, keep their sharp black and white stripes through initial phase, and even terminal phase striped parrotfish still have a really clear stripe, so they never go through a dull brown faded stripe phase like this one.  As far as I've seen.

On other hand, as you say, this one doesn't seem to have the black tail borders that most initial phase princess parrotfish have.  On the other hand, I've read that's *most*, not all.

966,"&gt; We get it. This sub hates republicans.

That's a pointlessly dismissive comment that seeks to brush aside what this article actually contains: A dissection of a bunch of statements made by Republican candidates in the recent debate that highlight deep misunderstandings or lack of knowledge of the facts.  Brushing it away with ""this sub hates Republicans"" is just a way to deny that and avoid facing it, it seems to me.

&gt; What is interesting is that nobody is noting Obama's foreign policy failures at the moment

If you have a good quality article about what you consider to be Obama's foreign policy failures at the moment, post it.  I've seen articles critical of Obama's foreign policy get a lot of upvotes here in the past.  However, that's not what this article is about, and seems to be just another way for you to avoid facing what this article says by distracting people.  Obama does not display the kind of ignorance the Republican comments in this article display, but even if he did, ""but Obama does it too"" would be a childish way to avoid the issue.

&gt; let alone acknowledging he had no experience in such when running for election.

Obama actually had some foreign policy experience when he first ran.  He'd successfully co-led nuclear antiproliferation efforts involving foreign countries in his role as US Senator.  Now it's true that he didn't have massive foreign policy experience - very few Presidential candidates ever do - but he most certainly did not display this level of blatant ignorance.  In fact, it was his incisive understanding of foreign policy - especially his excellent analysis of the Iraq war - that allowed him to beat Hillary Clinton in the primaries.  He was certainly more than just a cut above the Republican candidates this article focuses on, in what he said about foreign policy when he ran.  So again, ""acknowledging he had no experience"", aside from only being partly true, also looks like a distraction without substance.  This article isn't criticising them for lack of experience, it's pointing out ridiculous things they said at the debate.  Things that, anyone who believes they make sense is very clueless or ignorant.",2015-12-17 17:46:56+00:00,cy2faw3,2.0,t1_cy20rb0,36285.0,inthenews

If they did one for Hawaii that's like their Caribbean or Galapagos books, it would make this so much easier!

If you haven't used their books, they not only describe the range of variability, but give photo examples specifically chosen to show you the range of variability in a species, and they also highlight and point out with arrows and extra text the specific characteristics you can use to tell a species apart from other very similar ones.

975,"A more ELI5 way of answering this question is: 180K of RAM is only twice what 90K is (IIRC Gates said this about 640K, but that detail doesn't matter).  If 90K turns out to not be much, then 180K - twice 90K - isn't much more.  It's just 90K more.  If it turns out we actually need ten times 90K, then we need almost 1MB.  If it turns out we actually need 100 times, then we need 9MB.  Maybe 90K turns out to be so little in hindsight, that we need *ten thousand* times as much, or a *million* times as much.

However, 256 bit encryption keys aren't twice the encryption of 128 bit keys.  What matters (leaving aside the quality of the encryption algorithm, which matters a lot but that's regardless of key size) is how hard it is to ""guess"" the right key by trying every alternative.  Looked at that way, a 129 bit key is twice as hard to guess as a 128 bit key, because it has one more bit, which means twice as many total possible combinations of bits.  A 130 bit key is four times as hard, a 131 bit key 8 times as hard...  so you only need 148 bits to get a key that's *more than a million times as hard* to crack as a 128 bit key.  And then a 149 bit key is twice as hard to crack as that!

A 256 bit key is 2^107 times as hard to crack as even that 149 bit key.

Yes, computers' ability to try all the possibilities keeps getting better and better very quickly.  We do occasionally have to increase key lengths to keep up with that.  But we don't have to increase them very much, or nearly as often, as we have had to increase memory capacity, because each step up in the key size is so infathomably *huge* compared to similar-sounding steps up in the size of memory or storage.",2015-12-13 19:55:27+00:00,cxxserz,4.0,t1_cxxotcr,5158.0,explainlikeimfive
976,"&gt; Are you looking for someone to say ""your comment was fine, reddit just downvotes comments that go against the hivemind?""

Weird suggestion.  No, I'm not.  I'm looking for two things:

1. Matters more: Either an explanation from the original commenter for the basis of their claim - some source or story or anything that suggests people learn this in training to drive T trains... OR an acknowledgement in the comment thread, visible to all other readers, that yeah this is just a random shot in the dark for which there's no evidence.

2. Less important: Some explanation for the downvotes on my original comment.  Whyever would so many people be hostile to pointing out that a claim appears to have no basis, or that if it does, it should be stated when the claim is made?  What reason are so many people opposed to that concept?

What actually happened: Lots of stupid self-righteous redditors who can't even be bothered to read or think, just jump to the conclusion ""oh look someone didn't like getting downvotes and decided to complain, let's downvote some more, that'll show the"".

Conclusion: I already believed this, and my many years on reddit have reinforced this belief repeatedly - /r/boston is one of the stupidest small subreddits that I've ever seen.  I go on lots and lots of small subs, even moderate some, and aside from subs deliberately themed around a stupid idea, it's really hard to find as high a concentration of idiocy as /r/boston outside of the huge subs.

It's not that I want more debates because I think of it as a political strategy to help Sanders, I just think it's a good thing in general.  Primarily for two reasons:

1. The reason candidates like Clinton usually don't want more debates is that they can shake things up.  By adding more moments of public focus and interest, they add more uncertainty to the campaigns.  For a front-runner, this is a risk they'd be happier without.  But for the public, it's a good thing.

2. Having more *Democratic* debates will help Democrats win the Presidential election.  If we have a long string of Republican debates with few Democratic debates, the story of the campaign will be all about Republican issues.  News articles and public attention will focus on the things Republicans emphasize.  If we want the Democratic nominee to win, we need to keep the public hearing and thinking about the issues Democrats talk about, and the more debates, the more that'll happen.",2015-12-07 01:14:27+00:00,cxpr1x4,1.0,t3_3vowki,21437.0,PoliticalDiscussion

But it does allow him to escape paying taxes on that money, even if he never uses it for charity.  They said all this directly, it's the main point of the article, and you ignored it completely and are repeating the ""charity"" claim.  Whether he ""pledged"" or not, he did *not* actually give any of this money to charity.  Maybe he will in the future, but it's being reported all over the place that he actually did it.  And it turns out he can avoid paying taxes on it whether he gives any of it to charity or not.

&gt; So then the article shifts focus to try and slam the fact that one person can influence a lot of society with all that money (""tech oligarchy""). Sure, and that's a problem when applied to politics, but when the goal is fighting disease? What are we supposed to do, not have wealthy people spend billions of their own dollars on fighting disease if they so choose?

Assuming you actually understand the article (which is not clear), then this comment is revealing.  In context, what this part is about is that a superwealthy person can **redirect their money away from taxes** to decide how *they* want to spend it, supposedly to do good, rather than go through normal democratic process like taxed money does.  They withdraw the portion of the money they should be contributing to the public, and choose where to direct it on their personal whim.  That is most certainly a problem, a very big one, and not scaremongering.

Possibly the best episode they ever did was the one explaining the housing bubble that led to the  financial crisis, ""The Giant Pool of Money"": http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money

The following year they did a followup episode:
http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/390/return-to-the-giant-pool-of-money

Timelessly relevant, I think, are this pair about criminal justice in the US.  ""Perfect Evidence"" examines how innocent people get convicted, looking at real stories of people who we're absolutely 100% sure did not do what they were convicted of.  The first half of ""The Facts Don't Matter"" gives an amazingly good illustration of how ""national security"" is used as an excuse to cover up incompetence and embarassment by the government.

1. ""Bold black stripes on upper body"".  In the picture these are very clearly delineated black strips, going all the way to near the tail.

2. ""Yellowish green dorsal hump"".

3. ""Yellow saddle or spot at base of tail.""  In the picture it's a ""saddle"", a V or paren shape extending down both tail tips.

So on this picture, for #3 this must be the ""or spot"" variation - I guess they don't all have dark color running down both tail tips?  For #2, maaybe...  I didn't think this fish had it, but if I reinterpret what I see I guess it does seem to have a yellowish-green area around where the hump should be.

So #3 and #2 seem ambiguous to me, this fish might have them both or maybe just one.

But then there's #1 - on this fish, only one of the black stripes seems to clearly run all the way to near the tail.  The others either fizzle out or become fuzzy near the head.

That suddenly makes it easy to distinguish these two whenever I can see the tail.

Unfortunately subadult French angelfish seem to start getting a square cut tail, so then you really can't tell.  But you can tell they're not juveniles anymore because the lower lip turns yellow/white.

1101,"&gt; I know eventually we will get the people saying ""These are just a few bad apples"" and ""This doesn't represent the majority of law enforcement."" And they're right

Not really right.  It's not a factual statement, it's a way of framing how you look at it, and it's misleading - especially the ""bad apples"" version.

Both of these statements, and particularly the first, invite you to see individual isolated bad people doing what they shouldn't inside an otherwise good system.  It would be more true to look at it instead as a system that brings out that behavior, that both provides an environment conducive to it and that promises to protect it.

Although as some of the example in this article show, the system doesn't always follow through on the implied promise of protecting bad behavior, that promise is there nonetheless, and it draws out that behavior.  It's a rotten barrel that spoils more of the apples you put into it, than were bad to begin with.

It's not just the implication that you're going to be immune to consequences, it's also the opportunity that's offered.  A system that gives people authority over vulnerable people, but presents those people as opponents to be mastered or who are trying to outwit you... some of that is unavoidable in policing, but it means we *need* very strong monitoring, oversight, and accountability to prevent the situation from tempting officers to turn bad.  Many will prevent it on their own, but the system puts them under pressure to abuse, and not all will resist that pressure.  So the system needs to be more than merely ""not rotten"" to prevent itself from gradually rotting, so to speak.  It needs to be actively working to keep itself good.  And it's not trying nearly hard enough.

These are the truths that statements like ""just a few bad apples"" and ""this doesn't represent the majority"" are working to keep people from looking at, and that's why those kinds of statements are not ""right"".",2015-11-01 18:41:54+00:00,cwkmyw2,2.0,t1_cwkdx4u,17654.0,news

Sanders volunteers are totally free to go to the same places to collect signatures for him.

1127,"The Romney guy they base the second half of the article on has a hypothesis that sounds plausible only if you're totally unfamiliar with what actually happened.  But it turns out to be false:

&gt; But for some, like Zac Moffatt, Romney’s 2012 digital director and founder of the digital shop Targeted Victory, that rationale doesn’t cut it. Conservative tech minds might be a minority, he says, but they do exist, and it doesn’t require that many of them to pull off a campaign. “I don’t need 100,000 engineers,” he says. “I need 100 good ones.”

&gt; Moffatt argues, instead, that the difference in the two parties’ ability to recruit tech talent is that one has had the benefit of winning the last two elections. “It’s a lot easier to work for Barack Obama than it was to try to convince someone to work for Mitt Romney, who they might not have known,” he says.

&gt; Obama’s incumbent status meant that members of his tech team, many of whom had already worked together and operated under a common philosophy, could get a jumpstart on building technology for the general election. Romney’s team, meanwhile, had to weather a primary cycle and ramp up almost instantly once he won the nomination.

What about Obama in 2008?  Lots of stories that year about how his campaign had great tech talent and tools, way better than the Republicans.  But he wasn't considered the frontrunner until after primaries actually started voting; he was considered a long shot during the primary campaigns the previous year.  There hadn't been an incumbent Democratic President for 8 years, since the 2000 election - when blogs had barely even been invented.

Since I was there, I can tell you what happened:

Howard Dean's campaign in 2003/4 gathered a large amount of tech talent and used it well.  He was also considered a long shot at first; then briefly for a few months he was the frontrunner, before he became the #2 candidate and Kerry won.

Kerry's campaign didn't have much time to adopt the talent and practices of the Dean campaign, and besides, they were much too set in their old ways of campaigning to even be open to trying.  BUT!

In 2005, Howard Dean was elected head of the DNC.  During his four year tenure, one of the main things he did was overhaul the DNC's use of technology, and bring in some of the people who worked on his campaign.  NGP VAN, the merger of two pre-existing Democratic tech companies, supplies this database; that began in 2005 IIRC, while there was still no Democratic incumbent.

At the same time, a bunch of former Dean staffers and volunteers formed a variety of companies to do technology for Democrats.  Echo Ditto for online &amp; social media strategy; Blue State Digital for online tools to build campaign web sites, run mailing lists, and do fundraising; and others.  Barack Obama's campaign used Blue State Digital for their online stuff.  Joe Rospars, who'd worked on Howard Dean's campaign and co-founded Blue State Digital, was Obama's head digital strategy person.

All of this infrastructure and tech talent and deep bench of companies and experience was built without the benefit of incumbency.  Republicans could've been doing the same thing out of the 2011/12 primaries, and even before.  That they haven't been doing it cannot be attributed to the fact that they didn't win the election.

[ When I say ""I was there"", I mean I was involved in many parts of this.  I was the lead organizer of Howard Dean meetups in Massachusetts in 2003/4 and worked with Dean groups in many other states as well as with the campaign, and did online training and development of use of tech tools by local organizers.  I was one of the people the Kerry campaign asked for advice from in 2004 after Kerry won the primaries, though they mostly didn't take our advice.  I worked for Blue State Digital for the second half of 2008 as a sysadmin on barackobama.com infrastructure.

1128,"The Romney guy they base the second half of the article on has a hypothesis that sounds plausible only if you're totally unfamiliar with what actually happened.  But it turns out to be false:

&gt; But for some, like Zac Moffatt, Romney’s 2012 digital director and founder of the digital shop Targeted Victory, that rationale doesn’t cut it. Conservative tech minds might be a minority, he says, but they do exist, and it doesn’t require that many of them to pull off a campaign. “I don’t need 100,000 engineers,” he says. “I need 100 good ones.”

&gt; Moffatt argues, instead, that the difference in the two parties’ ability to recruit tech talent is that one has had the benefit of winning the last two elections. “It’s a lot easier to work for Barack Obama than it was to try to convince someone to work for Mitt Romney, who they might not have known,” he says.

&gt; Obama’s incumbent status meant that members of his tech team, many of whom had already worked together and operated under a common philosophy, could get a jumpstart on building technology for the general election. Romney’s team, meanwhile, had to weather a primary cycle and ramp up almost instantly once he won the nomination.

What about Obama in 2008?  Lots of stories that year about how his campaign had great tech talent and tools, way better than the Republicans.  But he wasn't considered the frontrunner until after primaries actually started voting; he was considered a long shot during the primary campaigns the previous year.  There hadn't been an incumbent Democratic President for 8 years, since the 2000 election - when blogs had barely even been invented.

Since I was there, I can tell you what happened:

Howard Dean's campaign in 2003/4 gathered a large amount of tech talent and used it well.  He was also considered a long shot at first; then briefly for a few months he was the frontrunner, before he became the #2 candidate and Kerry won.

Kerry's campaign didn't have much time to adopt the talent and practices of the Dean campaign, and besides, they were much too set in their old ways of campaigning to even be open to trying.  BUT!

In 2005, Howard Dean was elected head of the DNC.  During his four year tenure, one of the main things he did was overhaul the DNC's use of technology, and bring in some of the people who worked on his campaign.  NGP VAN, the merger of two pre-existing Democratic tech companies, supplies this database; that began in 2005 IIRC, while there was still no Democratic incumbent.

At the same time, a bunch of former Dean staffers and volunteers formed a variety of companies to do technology for Democrats.  Echo Ditto for online &amp; social media strategy; Blue State Digital for online tools to build campaign web sites, run mailing lists, and do fundraising; and others.  Barack Obama's campaign used Blue State Digital for their online stuff.  Joe Rospars, who'd worked on Howard Dean's campaign and co-founded Blue State Digital, was Obama's head digital strategy person.

All of this infrastructure and tech talent and deep bench of companies and experience was built without the benefit of incumbency.  Republicans could've been doing the same thing out of the 2011/12 primaries, and even before.  That they haven't been doing it cannot be attributed to the fact that they didn't win the election.

[ When I say ""I was there"", I mean I was involved in many parts of this.  I was the lead organizer of Howard Dean meetups in Massachusetts in 2003/4 and worked with Dean groups in many other states as well as with the campaign, and did online training and development of use of tech tools by local organizers.  I was one of the people the Kerry campaign asked for advice from in 2004 after Kerry won the primaries, though they mostly didn't take our advice.  I worked for Blue State Digital for the second half of 2008 as a sysadmin on barackobama.com infrastructure.

In other words, you think parliamentary systems are ideal, and want to do away with the separation of powers and the executive branch altogether?

However you design the voting system for a presidential election, it has to produce a result where one person wins and the others don't.

1131,"States could do it that way, but it wouldn't work well because of how few electoral votes there are.  New York gets 233 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, so they can design a system that allocates them proportionally at several different levels and the results still make sense no matter what the election results.  With 29 electoral votes, New York could kinda do it with the general election and come out okay, but lots of states have single-digit electoral votes.  What do you do when you have 4 electoral votes and your state votes 54/46?  What if you have 3 electoral votes?  It's even worse when there are three candidates with significant support.

So most states can't do proportional electoral vote allocation and makes sense.  Two states (Nebraska and Maine) which have 4 EV do winner-take-all for each of their 2 congressional districts, plus winner-take-all for the whole state with the other 2 EV, so it's possible for one candidate to win 3 and the other to win 1.  But you can't even do that for a smaller state with 3 EV since it only has one Congressional district.

On top of that, consider what happens when a large state like New York, one of the few that could sensibly do it proportionally, decides to do that?  Instead of there being 29 electoral votes at stake in New York, if it's allocated proportionally, it gets down to just 2 or 3!  That's because the margin of victory isn't going to change *that* much - maybe someone who does much better than expected will gain a few percentage points, enough for another 1 or 2 or maybe 3.  But candidates can campaign much more cheaply in a little state for the same number of EV, so why bother with big expensive New York?

Okay, you may say, right now New York effectively has 0 EV at stake because everyone knows the Democrat will win.  Consider Ohio or Florida though - they're not going to cut down their electoral voting power to a small fraction of what it is now.  So should a state like New York act on its own?  That'd be grossly unfair if, say, Texas doesn't do the same thing, because Democrats would get 0 EV for their huge number of votes in Texas, while Republicans would get a bunch of EV for their votes in New York.

And remember that even if several big states were to agree to act together, it would still be impossible for most of the small states with very small numbers of EVs to do this sensibly, so the big states would still be undercutting themselves compared to small states.  Small states *already* have disproportionate voting power now, and that would make it much worse.",2015-10-29 23:20:22+00:00,cwhrazk,5.0,t1_cwhic70,13803.0,SandersForPresident

If only it were just that.  But that's an illusion.  The driver of the ""other side"" is the idea that women must not be free to have sex that they want to have, and must suffer punishing consequences if they dare to.

Yes, there are individuals who feel as you describe.  But if that were what it was about, we would not be seeing the kind of powerful antiabortion politics and organization that we do.  There's a big difference between antiabortion *individuals* who privately feel that way, and the organized groups driving toxic antiabortion politics in the US.  (although sadly, just as a lot of gun owners get taken in by the NRA's radicalism, so do many decent people with antiabortion feelings get taken in by this lot and participate in their campaigns)

What's really driving it is a discomfort with or solid hostility to women having sexual freedom of any sort.  Planned Parenthood as a whole provides the kind of health care and support that allows women to be safe and healthy *and* have sex as independent people, whether married or not, and not just for having babies.  While abortion is a very very small percentage of what Planned Parenthood does, that health care and support that allows safe &amp; healthy sexuality is a much larger part of what they do, perhaps even a majority if you look at it broadly.

There's a good reason Planned Parenthood is the #1 enemy of these groups.  It stands for everything they oppose, through and through.  Independent women having sex because they want to and not suffering unnecessary consequences that would punish them for it.

These groups want women who have sex to be punished and suffer consequences.  That's what drives the antiabortion movement, and that's why the same groups oppose contraception, sex education, and a host of other things that actually reduce abortions.

It's not early, it's late.  It has been obvious for at least a year and probably two that Putin is a disaster for Russia.  He's consistently putting his own personal political interests at the top, and savaging Russia's interests in the process.

Russia is getting deeper and deeper into a quagmire in Syria that's beginning to look a lot like the USSR in Afghanistan, and which the US is wisely keeping more distance from.  Russia's economy has been tanking, and people have been predicting that it would do so, and how and why it would do so, for a couple of years.  Russia's relations with most of the world are fraying.

That canard about the Russian Navy in Crimea never made sense.  If Russia kept strong relationships with Ukraine there's no way Ukraine would've kicked Russia's Navy out.  Russia threw out a positive relationship with Ukraine, and even a neutral relationship, in exchange for just Crimea, when it could've had Ukraine + Crimea as an ally and the Navy base to keep on using.

Putin has been knee-jerk reactive, with no coherence, and only damage and loss to Russia's strategic and economic interest.  He's got nothing to show for it except his own personal power, and that's exactly what he seems to care about.",2015-10-23 23:19:52+00:00,cwamb6x,2.0,t1_cwak6cj,4008.0,worldevents

Lots of online species identification guides and courses give you one or two photos per species, and you end up learning to recognize those specific photos rather than the actual species.  With this course I'm trying to give lots of photos of each one, so that as you get tested in review you'll often see photos you don't recognize.  If you get consistently good at identifying a species in review, that ought to mean you're not depending on recognizing the photos themselves, and are probably good at recognizing the actual fish in the wild.

A couple of the reef fish photography sites gave me permission to use their photos!  But even with that and with my snorkeling photos from Hawaii and Florida, there are still a lot of species I couldn't include because I've got only 1 or 2 or 3 photos of them.  I did make a few exceptions, but mostly I considered 5 photos a bare minimum, and aimed for 10+ on a majority of species.

1255,"Hi!  As you probably know, הִיא is not a form of the very ""to be"", it's a pronoun: ""she"".  As you possibly also know, the same pronoun can mean ""it"" for feminine nouns, just as the pronoun for ""he"" means ""it"" for masculine nouns.

In that lesson I tried to show you how you can use a pronoun or not in ""is"" statements.  You can see there are a bunch of examples without a pronoun, and some with.  That's because both or correct in Hebrew - the pronoun is optional, and doesn't necessarily make a difference, though it can be used for emphasis.

However, whether you use he/she/it or not, there is no ""is"" or ""am"" or ""are"" in any of these statements.  That is, as you noted in your post, implied; there's no word for it.

For example, one of the items on that level is ""the lake is small"" = ""הָאֲגַם קָטָן"" - which literally translates to ""the lake small"", and the verb is implied.  You could just as well say ""הָאֲגַם הוּא קָטָן"", which translates literally as ""the lake it small"" (the pronoun for ""he"" is used for ""it"" here because lake is a masculine noun).  Again, the verb ""is"" is implied; it's not present in the Hebrew.

Similarly, you could say ""אָלִיס הִיא מַדְעָנִית"" or just ""אָלִיס מַדְעָנִית"" and it would mean the same thing.  In neither of those is the verb to be present.  However, if you put the pronoun in, the sentence is a little clearer and harder to mis-hear, so that's a reason why people often do it.  Another reason is that it adds some subtle emphasis to the statement compared to leaving it out, as if sometimes the case in English when you add an extra syllable or word that isn't necessary but doesn't change the meaning.",2015-08-21 03:04:29+00:00,cua9ml8,1.0,t3_3hnme9,96356.0,hebrew

1268,"&gt; One, you can only for so many pictures of a species on a page on a book, and Hawaii is home to hundreds of species of fishes. For another, fish look way different under the bright strobes of a professionals camera vs a point and shoot or when you are just snorkeling around.

Sure, but it's easier than identifying it without those!  I've had great luck identifying a majority of my photos from Florida keys reefs (which also have hundreds of species), using a fairly simple guide that's oriented towards visual identification.  I'm pretty sure some of the fish I've seen there aren't even in that book, yet it helped me quite easily ID a solid majority.  Sometimes it's clearly obvious just from the picture.  Other times, it's less obvious, but the guide helps me quickly determine the most likely species or two or three, and then I look those up online for more detail or more photos.

&gt; if you look through the keys he does use obvious anatomical traits a good bit

Yes, I've seen some of those in the keys, problem is they often come after several branches on hard-to-see things.  So to use the ones that are more obvious, you have to keep mental track of a bunch of different branches, and sometimes all you can tell is ""well it's not foo; if it is a species on this branch of the key then it's bar"" - but the same trait isn't used on some other branch.

1270,"Vermont didn't ""try it"" nor ""fail"" - the way you write that makes it sound like they implemented a single payer system and that failed to work.  What actually happened is that Vermont was going to try to, but then realized before implementation that it wasn't going to be practical to try this at a state level, and backed off.

The real answer is actually a much better answer to OP's question than your cynical sounding and misleadingly glib comment.  Because the reasons Vermont ended up *not* trying single payer, are exactly what answers OP's question.

I'm not an expect on this, but I understand that *some* of the obstacles to doing this are:

1. Medicare and Medicaid already exist, and they cover a large chunk of the population.  While a Massachusetts-like private insurer model is designed to accomodate Medicare as just one of multiple insurers, this adds a complication to single payer, since it's no longer ""single"".  It also complicates the financing, since the federal programs take away a lot of potential rate-payers *and* subsidize them.  And everyone is already paying their SSI tax to cover Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, even if they live in Vermont and would get their health coverage from Vermont's system.

2. Lots of companies employ people in Vermont but are based elsewhere.  Politically complicated to get them to participate, so Vermont was going to exempt them, but that put another hole in the plan and more wrinkles in its financing.  If you're a national government you get to make laws that fully cover all business and employment in your country, wherever the company is based, but if you're a state in the US you don't have that latitude.

3. It's very very easy for anyone to move into or out of Vermont, and they don't lose any rights or need permission to work or anything like that.

Now I think Vermont could've come up with a different plan that played to the strengths of #2 and #3, rather than to their weaknesses.  A plan that makes it an advantage to employers to employ people in Vermont because they don't have to worry about those employees' health insurance at all, or pay for it, and that encourages healthy employable people to move to Vermont for those jobs.  But I don't know whether #1 has any good solutions.

However, to address OP's question, I don't think that's necessarily the best thing to do.  It may be an option for a state to try because the Federal government isn't stepping up to the task.  But it seems pretty clear to me that it would be much easier and likelier to succeed at a federal level.  Medicare-for-all, legislation that simply lets anyone who wants to buy into Medicare, is a really simple straightforward thing the Federal government could do.  Much easier and more straightforward and amenable to projection &amp; planning, than anything a state could do on its own.  If it worked out, it could lead to single payer.  If it didn't work out that well, no big deal, Medicare wouldn't gain a huge number of new people, would keep going more or less as it is, and the rest of Obamacare would stay as it is.",2015-08-19 00:00:24+00:00,cu7o7mk,2.0,t1_cu75f7j,28686.0,PoliticalDiscussion

1277,"&gt; I was just assuming that because they are protogynous hermaphrodites that males look like males and females look like females

That article frames it quite differently from what I've recently read and have been told from a few other sources.

Parrotfish go through two stages of maturity, an initial phase and a terminal phase, and they transition colors when they change phase (except for one species that only has one phase).  Some parrotfish species are always female in initial phase, and only those that change to terminal phase become male.  But other parrotfish species, like stoplight parrotfish, mature into either male or female in the initial phase.  Those look the same.  Some wrasses do this too.

I recently asked about this, as well as found a book about this, and confirmed another thing: the term ""supermale"" refers to the terminal phase males of species whose initial phase can be either male or female.  So terminal phase male stoplight parrotfish can also be called ""supermale parrotfish"", but that term does not apply to parrotfish species where the initial phase is always female and the only males are terminal phase.

&gt;  Here's a site states that the female's color can range from grey to the darker colors like the one in my picture. 

It doesn't really say that.  It says,

&gt; Primary males and females are often colored very similarly in dull reds, grays, browns, and blacks

That description applies to all of the *other* photos I've seen of initial phase stoplights (what this site calls ""primary"") - they are colored in a combination of reds, grays, browns, and blacks.  But this site does not say that they're ever gray *only*, with no red or brown at all, and white-pink fins.  That doesn't mean it never happens, but this site certainly doesn't say that it does.  And if it does happen much, I'd expect to find some other photos somewhere of it, but my searches have not turned up any at all.

That's why I'm not confident, and beginning to suspect this one may have been a hybrid.",2015-08-17 18:36:19+00:00,cu657ho,4.0,t1_cu60977,7625.0,species

So, what makes you confident that this one is a stoplight?  Are the yellow eyes conclusive?  Or have you seen others, either in person or online, that look like this one? Or is it just process of elimination, it can't possibly be any of the other species one might find in Florida?  Or maybe it's a hybrid?

BTW, there's no way to know whether it's male or female.  Initial phase stoplight parrotfish can be either sex.  Terminal phase is always male, though.",2015-08-17 03:44:40+00:00,cu5jecf,2.0,t1_cu5j2bc,706.0,species

&gt; On the opposite end of the spectrum, a stoplight parrotfish in the initial phase can be either a male or a female, whereas a stoplight parrotfish in the terminal phase is definitely a male, so ""terminal"" and ""initial"" would not be interchangable with ""male"" and ""female"" in this case.

Ahah!  That answers half my question(s).  But it also points out that I didn't quite ask all of the right questions, so I'll try for some clarification:

-4: Do all parrotfish species, regardless of their sex, go through the three phases juvenile -&gt; initial -&gt; (some individuals) terminal ?  Or, is that true for all except the marbled?  Or are there some that don't have initial and terminal phase at all?

-5a: Is it the case that with some species all initial phase are female, while with other species some initial are male and some are female ... but for all species, terminal phase is always male?

-5b: Are there any species where initial phase is all male?  I think not, but can't hurt to ask.

-5c: I've heard the term ""supermale"" used for stoplight parrotfish, and maybe others, referring to a terminal phase male.  Does that term always mean the terminal phase male of a species in which initial phase can be male or female, but terminal is always male?

-6: For parrotfish species that can be either male or female in the *same* phase, those males &amp; females still have the same general coloration - that is, you cannot tell their sex by their coloration when they're in the same phase, yes?

* [Brown with white tail](https://www.reddit.com/r/species/comments/3gecru/brown_parrotfish_with_red_lips_and_white_tail/), identified as an initial phase bullethead parrotfish.

* Two posts of [this blue one with other colors between scales](https://www.reddit.com/r/species/comments/3gj8h4/one_more_parrotfish_i_cant_identify_for_sure_from/) - on which there is a difference of opinion about whether it's a palenose parrotfish or a spectacled parrotfish.  One person also said bicolor, but I think that one doesn't look as likely as either palenose or spectacled.

* ... and then there's this one :)

Are you saying this one is a stareye, bullethead (probably not), palenose, or spectacled?  Pictures of stareye parrotfish and palenose parrotfish both seems kinda plausible to me I guess, but I'm not sure which one you mean.  Also, what is the ""whip tail"", I'm not sure what you mean?

Spaced repeat is supposed to schedule your next review further in the future for things you get right, and closer for things you get wrong, but in both cases it tries to space things out far enough that the review is meaningful (you didn't just see it an hour ago) but also close enough that your chance of still remembering it is fairly high.

Difficult words is an invitation to review things ""out of turn"" - regardless of when the spaced repeat system scheduled them for.  Once you review them, it re-schedules them based on whether you got them right or wrong in the ""difficult words"" review.  As a result, sometimes you'll get words way too soon and ""trick"" memrise into thinking you know them better than you do, and other times, as a result of that tricking, you'll get words too far in the future and be more likely to forget them.  Overall your learning will be less efficient, *and* you'll learn things later (by weeks or even months) than you would've.

If you're trying to draw geographically compact &amp; sensible districts neutrally, in most states you'd still end up with a few ""city districts"" that have &gt;70% democratic voters - often even &gt;80%.  But since rural areas are so sparse, they'd be combined into districts with suburban areas and/or small cities, and the Republican percentage would rarely get much higher than 60% in most of those.  As a result, you end up with a higher proportion of Democratic voters packed into a smaller number of much-safer districts, giving Republicans more districts where they have an advantage - exactly the sort of thing deliberate partisan gerrymandering tries to do.

Add on to that one more kind of gerrymandering: rural prisons.  Nobody wants to live next to a prison, so they get placed in rural areas away from people's homes.  The population of a prison counts for the census unit it's located in, so prisoners are ""represented"" by the district where the prison is, and increase its population.

He was being pressured by the Olympic committee to sign an agreement that the city would agree to pay for cost overruns if they happened.  Boston 2024 was assuring him that their multilayered insurance plans made it so that the city wouldn't have to cover any costs, even if it signed that agreement.  A large portion of Boston's and the state's population was not happy about the possibility of paying with public money for the highly profitable Olympics' expenses.
Walsh, caught in between all of these, wanted to have Boston 2024's plan studied to see if it really would protect the city from any contingencies as they claimed.  If it really did, then he could agree to the USOC's demand while being able to tell the skeptical public that their concerns were addressed and the city would not be on the hook for cost overruns.  But figuring that out was going to take time, and the USOC said ""sign now or we're done"".  So he punted and said fine, we're done then.

- it can sense a display

- it is getting charged

Not only is the term ""unicorn"" useful for describing a particularly common phenomenon (M-F couples looking for a bi poly woman to date them both), but its existence also highlights for us one of the ways in which relationship dynamics differ a lot by gender, and in which sexual orientation differs by gender, in our current culture (I don't know if it's nature or nurture or some of both, but either way, it is a thing).  Seeking to change the definition not only dilutes a now-useful term into something less useful, but it also seeks to erase that perhaps-uncomfortable fact and gloss it over, pretending it doesn't exist.  It's similar to (though much milder than) various other attempts to address gender issues not by tackling them but by acting as if they don't exist.

So named because people willing to agree to such arrangements are vanishingly rare, whereas couples looking for a woman who will agree to these terms are incredibly common.

Perhaps you're latching onto ""almost"" even though there's no mention at all in that text of the possibility of men being unicorns.  It seems to me the ""almost"" merely alludes to the possibility that people may say unicorn to refer to something entirely different, either an actual horse with horn, or as a metaphor for any rare hard to find creature.  But it's quite clear that in this particular context of unicorn usage in polyamory, it's talking about women, not men.

Furthermore, it gives the same explanation of *why* the term is ""unicorn"": 

&gt; *because people willing to agree to such arrangements are vanishingly rare, whereas couples looking for a woman who will agree to these terms are incredibly common.*

A unicorn is a bi poly *woman* who's up for joining a M-F couple who are looking for a bi poly woman to date them together.  While there certainly do exist bi poly men interested in dating a M-F couple, they are not unicorns.

Edit: In another thread, someone linked to [this poly glossary](https://www.morethantwo.com/polyglossary.html) which has a definition of ""unicorn"" that seems about right:

The one main flaw in that definition is that it's not clear about whether ""agree not to have any relationships other than the ones with the couple"" is part of the ""or"" in ""and/or"", or a requirement, and mistakenly implies it's a requirement.  ""Unicorn"" has, from the beginning of the term, been applied where the couple doesn't mind whether their unicorn also has other relationships, as well as when the couple does mind that.

Your usual phone number remains yours on WhatsApp until someone else takes it, and nobody else can take it unless they actually have that number for real on their phone, so as long as your account is still active and still belongs to you, nobody else can take that number from you.

Although reddit's poor support for mods has been a big problem that is now getting a lot of attention, the flip side still isn't getting addressed: On much of reddit, it's the moderators that are the main problem.

One pattern that has been repeated many times on some of the largest subreddits is that moderators take a sub that is quite popular and make sweeping changes to it that are very unpopular and unwanted by the existing community.  Sometimes it's the original mods who do this, other times it's newer mods who have hijacked or gradually taken over an existing sub.  But even if it's the original mods, if they've allowed a sub to grow to tens of thousands over a few years and then decide to drastically change it, that's still really bad.

There are two aspects to this:

1. reddit has no mechanism for a subreddit's existing community to protest the mod team and get it replaced.

2. when people try to create new alternative subreddits to replace one hijacked or otherwise damaged by its mods, there's no way to communicate that to the existing user community.  Most of them will never find out about the new replacement sub because the older one is usually squatting on the good name that everyone will think of first.

As an added level, there are mod teams that have done this with some of the original subs that were created by reddit when subs were first introduced.  Reddit admins really should've stepped in to save those subs, such as /r/politics, from their toxic unaccountable control-freak mod teams.",2015-07-16 23:55:02+00:00,ct5zpv4,1.0,t3_3djjxw,14087.0,announcements

&gt; Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told CNN that Clinton understood the question to be if she was under subpoena when the emails were deleted, this past December.

If you look at the actual question and answer in context, on the one hand it's true that she said ""I never had a subpoena"", but on he other hand it seems very likely that she was actually saying ""I had never had a subpoena at the time you're asking about it"", and it's perfectly plausible to interpret what she said that way.

Yes.  I suspected it was doing that so I experimented by opening multiple tabs on the same course.  In one tab, I did difficult words.  In the other tabs, I opened the levels on which some of those words were.  After getting them right in difficult words, I reloaded those tabs - and watched the review schedule bump up to the next level (the next longer interval).

Other, somewhat less important issues that I've reported (months ago):

* Hot pink, with its high red content, is an action color that takes attention away from the more important review and learn action buttons.  Especially if one doesn't want to do difficult words, but even if you do them because the button is still pink, though dimmer.  It litters all course lists with pink buttons and makes it harder to spot which courses actually should be drawing my attention (with bright blue review buttons, that used to be the most prominent items before you added pink buttons).

* If I get a word wrong and it goes into difficult words, and later I choose to ignore that word, it remains in the difficult words counter - and continues making that button hot pink - but I can't clear it out.  Clicking difficult words doesn't actually give me that word.

* If a course maintainer removes a word from a course, same thing - it stays in the difficult words counter and keeps making the button hot pink, but there's no way to clear it.

* During a difficult words session launched from within a course, it doesn't tell you which course you're in.

* After finishing a difficult words session launched from within a course, you're not returned to the course, you're dumped back on the top level homepage.

All of these problems remained unfixed for months after I first posted about them, so the feature has always seemed like a mess to me.

1439,"Memrise is probably not the right tool for you, then.  It's based on the power of the spaced repeat system, which is based on the fact that you learn more effectively by waiting long enough *without* reviewing something over and over, and then refreshing your memory on it just at the point where you probably still remember it but it's fading.  That's the most effective way to get it into your memory, it's the core idea memrise is based on, and it depends on taking that time off and not over-reviewing.

Memrise is the antithesis to the much less effective method of repeatedly drilling yourself over and over on the same things - a method that takes up a lot lot lot more time but ends up with you remembering things somewhat less effectively despite all the time you've basically wasted.  People do it a lot because it *does* work, in a sense - you do remember some things.

But it's also on ""difficult words"", and you decide to do your difficult words right now.  You see that word again, but since you *just* reviewed it maybe 10 minutes ago, of course you remembered it!  You get it right, and memrise acts the same as if you got it right during a regular review ... so its next review is moved forward to 24 hours.  A few hours later when you do difficult words again, it's still there (because you had gotten it wrong twice), but it's still recent enough that you kinda remember it so you get it right yet again, and memrise pushes its next review to 2 days away.

That's the sexism, right there.

What do you mean by ""tend to classify men as either friend or lover material""?  All you're actually saying is that (assuming a straight woman) there are some men a woman is sexually/romantically interested in and others she is not.  Which is exactly the same for men when it comes to women.

Well, you're also saying that women are much less likely to change their mind later on and become interested in a man they weren't previously interested in, than men are.  On that I'm pretty sure you're wrong, that it's a stereotype with no actual evidence behind it.  If you've got a citation for that implication, though, go ahead and provide it.

""friend zone"" is just a pointless and misleading term used by some people to simply say ""she's not interested"".  It's a term that comes from sexist culture, and once you drop the sexism, it's a term that loses its meaning and becomes useless.  You can just be straightforward and say ""she's not interested.""

There are a lot of courses where it's never nice, especially ones where you're typing in phrases.  Even on simple easy-to-type vocab courses, what it does is encourage you to hit enter quickly, fail to correct typos, and fool memrise into thinking you don't know the answer, and mess up the spaced repeat.

Once you've fully learned a whole course and everything in it is on 180 day spacing, having an option to do a speed test (that doesn't affect the review schedule) could be a nice bonus.

1450,"&gt; I am learning a huge, brilliant language course. However I have little interest at this point in time in learning to write. 

What you want is to find a course in that same language, but that prompts you in that language and has you enter the answer in English.  For some languages, it's easy to find such courses; for others, it's hard, but there are probably some out there.

For example, here's an Arabic course I'm taking in which I have not had to type any Arabic at all, but I get to learn to read it and what it sounds like (since it has audio):

http://www.memrise.com/course/44611/basic-arabic-vocabulary-1/

(I learned how to read the letters from this course, which also doesn't require typing any Arabic: http://www.memrise.com/course/53083/how-to-read-arabic/ )

For Korean, I was never able to find a decent ""read Korean, type English"" course (and worse, some of the people on the forums for the Korean courses are fundamentalists who think anyone who wants such a course is naive and stupid and must be browbeaten into accepting that they must type in Korean).  I gave in and learned to type Korean but I'm learning much more slowly because of that and I still hope to find a good course that tests in the other direction.

For Hebrew, which I'm fluent in but bad at reading, I found a few courses where you read Hebrew and type English, but they were all bad - short, sloppy with mistakes, no audio, etc.  So I started making one of my own, which is coming along pretty well: http://www.memrise.com/course/702355/hebrew-reading-and-language-intro/

Unfortunately memrise's features for searching for courses are pretty bad, so in a language where there are a lot of courses that ask you to type that language and a few that want you to type English, it's pretty hard to find the latter.  You could ask on the general forum, or the course forums, and possibly other people learning the same language can point you to courses they've found.

And making your own course is always an option.  For a simple course, you can find vocabulary lists online, enter them into memrise, and set up a simple vocab course for yourself to learn them.",2015-07-07 21:54:21+00:00,csvhl3t,1.0,t3_3bmb18,643799.0,memrise

All of those alternate spellings are actually accepted by the course.  If you type ""kof"" (or ""qof"", which I think is more academically correct) or ""yod"" or etc., it will be marked correct.  Of the various possible spellings for each letter, I chose the one that most closely resembles what I hear say people most often, as the primary one to show.

Edit: Ahah, according to Wikipedia the letter names were spelled ""yod"" and ""qof"" for Sephardi Hebrew, and ""yud"" and ""kuf"" for Ashkenazi Hebrew, and modern Hebrew picked up the Ashkenazi names for these two letters as their standard names.  So it's right to use ""yud"" and ""kuf"" as the primary spellings here.

You start with nikud and later as you get more practice reading then you can drop it.

&gt; Not teaching it is better than teaching it wrong

Considering that for actual reading of Hebrew all that matters is learning the correct letters, since most Hebrew they read will not have nikud, what can you possibly mean about it being bad to learn the wrong nikud?

I hope you didn't jump to the conclusion that this course has incorrect pronunciations all over the place simply because I might not have been able to find accurate nikud.

I've been working on it for about a month and while I still plan to add a lot more, there's more than enough for people to start taking it now.  Anyone who starts now probably won't catch up to the parts I'm still actively working on so I'll stay ahead of them :)

Please post on the forum if you try it out (or look it over) and find mistakes!

Although I speak fluently, I left Israel at a young age and have been living in the US for a long time, so it's possible that I put in some examples that may seem a bit archaic.  Let me know if you see something like that?

Also, my Hebrew spelling is horrible because I learned to read here in the US; I used Google translate and various other web sources to check my spelling but there are probably a few errors I didn't catch.  Especially with nikud, since it's harder to find nikud on the web for many words.

Speaking of nikud, since the goal of this course is to teach new people but then get them used to reading enough that they'll be able to start recognizing words without nikud when they see them elsewhere, I'm deliberately using a combination of nikud *and* adding the yuds and vavs where they'd appear in regular print.  That way someone taking this course can learn the usual spelling of each word as they would see it without nikud later on.

So, anyway, I hope you try it out if you're trying to learn Hebrew, or pass it along if you think it'd be useful to people you know.

European parties are organizations that choose their own candidates.  *Then* you vote for one of them.  American major political parties aren't like that at all; they're broad umbrellas comprising many different and competing interest groups, who have long active public primary campaigns *against each other*.  You don't just get to vote for whoever the small Republican or Democratic organization decided should be their candidate for Governor or Representative or whatever; you have the option of being part of that decision just as you have the option of being part of the decision of which party's candidate wins office afterward.

Money corrupts this whole system in lots of ways, but that's a different issue.  It would do the same if we had more parties.  But you can't compare our number of parties to a European country.  In terms of candidates to vote for and diversity of their views, we often have *more* choice in the US than Europeans do in most of their elections.

This isn't a coincidence.  We probably *would* have more than two major parties if we didn't have public primaries.  It's the open process for party nomination that is the main reason we don't have more major parties; candidates who are serious about getting elected realize their chances are best if they run in a Democratic or Republican primary, so they do.  Without this kind of primary process, more of those candidates would've formed or joined other parties if the major parties didn't pick people whose views represented them, and then one or more of those other parties would've risen to prominence.",2015-06-23 15:04:58+00:00,csfy10u,2.0,t1_csfvad5,4884.0,worldpolitics

1490,"&gt; it's really hard to criticize the porn industry because so many people are just incapable of viewing the porn industry through a critical lens. They love their porn and they don't want to admit that there could ever be negative effects of it

That's what it looks like on the surface, but I think what lies underneath that is insecurity and fear about the place of porn in the world.  It's only recently emerged from being quite taboo and nearly universally considered immoral to even view let alone be in.  It's just finding its footing - and it has very far still to go to become better.  So while critiquing it is important and necessary, it also makes people who want porn to continue to be accepted understandably nervous.  If they fear its social standing is still very fragile, they see critiques, no matter how intelligent or constructive, as attacks that will make that standing crumble and make they themselves (people who view porn) morally condemned again.  Which to some extent is still happening, just less than in the past.

We do need to push through that and keep critiquing porn, and make it part of critiquing how society handles gender and sexuality in general*, because the status quo includes a lot of badness.  At the same time I think it's worth understanding where these defensive reactions to criticism of porn are often coming from.

----------

[ * Edit: actually I want to expand on that point more... ]

* In this interview she talks about how it's dangerous for young people to learn about sex from porn;  That's not specifically a problem about porn per se; it's a problem that *other* communication about sexuality is so repressed that porn then becomes for many young people the primary source available to them.   You fix that problem not by changing porn, but by making our society much more sexually open in other ways, so porn is in a different context and no longer anyone's primary sex intro and teacher.

* In this interview she talks about how teen girls often start out thinking they'll make some money doing things they expect to do, but find that it becomes financially difficult and that within a year or two opportunities are scarcer, and that drives them into negotiating to do more hardcore things that they initially wouldn't have thought they'd ever do.  Part of the reason for that is that once they start porn, they may feel a bit trapped in it, and there are a lot of things society does to create that.  For example, what if it *weren't* a permanent knock against your character, employability, desirability as a relationship partner or friend, etc., that you've done some porn?  It would make it a lot easier for women who find that they no longer want to do porn, to shift out of it.

* She makes the point of the conflict between the fact that it's great and empowering that women *can* do porn, and yet also limiting and constricting and harmful that women are made to feel that sex is their primary currency.  It's not porn itself that's doing that latter part, it's everything else around it.  It's how hard it is for women to reach top executive positions; it's how women are discouraged out of math and engineering study and careers; it's how women who aren't doing porn or physical performance are still talked about in terms of appearance way more than appropriate.  In that context, porn becomes one of the few ""openings"" and has outsized influence.  Create more openings, and porn's bad influences would diminish in context.  In other words, porn creates sex as currency as opportunity, while the rest of the world devalues or suppresses other ""currencies"", and that is limiting and harmful.

1503,"&gt; In this situation the previous result does impact the future results

Sure it *may*, but NOT in the way you claimed it does.  There's no automatic preference for a president of the other party after a couple of terms of a president of one party.

If there's a really awful presidency, like GWB, then of course it makes people prefer the other party.  But you can tell that by seeing that it's an awful presidency and people don't like it.  It's *not* because there was a streak.

You may be right about basketball (I don't know, I haven't researched that), but there is no evidence at all of such an effect on presidential elections.  Statisticians have looked at it to see if there's something like what you claimed, and if there is, you can't see it in the data.  Of course the data is sparse enough that who knows, maybe there is such an effect... but maybe there's the *opposite*.  We have no good evidence to believe it either way.

To put it another way: Yes, the *current* presidency definitely affects people's political views and voting proclivities.  But that's a very different statement from claiming that having 2+ terms of a president from one party makes the country more likely to prefer a president of the other party.  The first statement is obviously true; the second statement is very likely false and there's no evidence to support it.
