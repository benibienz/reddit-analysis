In debating whether to have a direct national election, they pointed out that the north would always win because they had so many voters.  But that only explains the formula for the number of electoral votes each state gets; it doesn't explain why the states don't get to directly say who those votes are cast for, but rather appoint actual people as electors who will meet to cast their votes.

Originally, in the late 18th century, a couple of reasons for this that I've read about were:

* They didn't envision a party system, they envisioned the electors would be educated informed people who could select a good president based on their own judgement.

* Communications across large distances were slow, so people wouldn't really know who they were voting for directly.

However, by the early 19th century when the 12th Amendment was passed, effectively tinkering with the electoral college system, both of those reasons were weak.  By then, there were political parties, and people were generally voting for their party's electors, who would be expected to vote for their party's nominee for president.

So why, at the time the 12th Amendment was passed, did they keep the mechanism of having human electors, rather than say that each state gets to decide directly which candidate for president and vice president that state's votes would go for?  What was the role of the human electors supposed to be, at that point?",AskHistorians,Why do we have electors?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5dt1ah/why_do_we_have_electors/

I've gone snorkeling there many times, and since I started diving, I've also done one dive trip there (and went to Marathon on a different dive trip).  About to go there again, but I'd also like to try somewhere else.

Our trip is already booked.  Staying in Homestead, FL, which is just a 30 minute drive from Key Largo, but also convenient to visit the Everglades and Big Cypress, so it's a nice central location.  Of the four days we have there, planning to go diving off Key Largo two days, and see birds and other land wildlife one day, but I'd like to add one more day of diving somewhere I haven't tried before.

* Should be a convenient drive from Homestead

* I've been diving for just under a year, 26 dives total, so not looking for wreck dives or anything really challenging.  And my girlfriend is a snorkeler, so places with shallow reefs where she can see stuff too.  We've had good experiences together on the keys in places where the bottom is ~30 feet or less, and the reef tops come up to ~10 feet or less.

* Corals, and the fish that live around them, are my main motivator.  It's not diving per se that I love as much as it's that diving is a great way to see those (though diving is pretty cool too :).  So that's what I'm looking to see.

* And of course, yes, I know Key Largo is better, as I've seen in comments on various past posts here where people were asking about dive spots in south Florida.  That's why I've gone to Key Largo before and plan to go there two days out of four this time.   But I'd love to try some new places, especially if they have a different mix of fish species than Key Largo &amp; Marathon.

* I don't yet have my own gear, I'm planning to rent from whichever dive operator I go with.  That makes shore dives less practical for this trip, logistically.  I've gone shore diving near home (Boston) a few times, but for this trip, I'm looking for boat diving.

For example, say I want to ensure that file /etc/something.conf does not have any lines that begin with ""riskyparam ..."" I don't know what value riskyparam is set to, and I don't know how many times it appears in the file, but I want to remove all of them if any are there.

file_line with a match and ensure=&gt;absent seemed at first like it might be a way to do this, but it turns out it doesn't work. You must have a line=&gt; in the file_line, and that line is some specific string (even if it's expanded from variables or functions), not a regex or substring match. With ensure=&gt;absent, file_line would remove anything matching that line completely. But when I don't know in advance what the offending line might contain, and want to remove all variations of it, that won't work.

Is there any way to do this?

Note: Suggestions that require managing the whole file, such as generating it from a template, would miss the point.  The explicit goal here is to allow the config file to be altered outside the control of this puppet instance, but just to ensure that if any matching lines get added to the file, they will be removed.

Sometime a couple of weeks ago, RES just stopped working completely.  It may have been after a Firefox upgrade.  I've since re-installed RES from the web site, restarted the browser many times, disabled RES and re-enabled it (after a browser restart), etc.

I can't access the RES settings console.  I don't have an account switcher.  My comment karma doesn't show, only link karma.  There are no message counts next to the orangered.  I can't RES-tag users, and can't see the tag text on people I've RES-tagged before.  All of RES is just not there.

However, when I load or reload a reddit page, some bit of RES seems to be there very briefly, tantalizingly, before it vanishes.  Like, I can see the message count next to my orangered icon really briefly, and then it's gone.

On the console, I consistently see three javascript errors, that just say ""no element found"" and nothing more.  I get many pages of CSS errors, though - most of them either ""Error in Parsing"" or ""Unknown Property"" foo, followed by ""Declaration Dropped"".  Here's a screenshot of the bottom page of the console, showing some of the CSS errors, followed by the three javascript errors: http://i.imgur.com/MeB9Bio.png

While I can see how that seemed reasonable to people who didn't bother to think about it and don't understand the web or reddit, it's a toxic and destructive policy for nearly any reddit - yet more and more are jumping on the bandwagon because they see other reddits doing it.

Problems:

* Which is the ""original"" title?  Many web pages have one title in the title tag, and another title in big bold lettering at the top.  Many of them edit one or both titles after publication.  So there might be 4 or more options for the ""original"" title, and some of them may no longer be visible when a moderator looks many hours later.

* Titles are written for a context.  Newspaper titles, youtube video titles, magazine titles, reddit titles - these are all different contexts.  The same title is often not most appropriate for all.  For example, newspaper titles strive for extreme brevity, but adding a few words can make something much clearer.

* Furthermore, a subreddit often has a context all its own.  Redditors who are part of that community are more likely to know what it is about the piece they're submitting that relates most to the interests of the subreddit, and can indicate that in the submission title.

* Original titles can be very hyped!  Many are deliberately written as clickbait.  A redditor can reword things to be less hyped.

* Original titles may lack critical context.  For example, they may use acronyms they expect are obvious to the readers of their blog, but a reddit post would do better to expand the acronym.  Or a local publication may name a town or local place or locally known business or personality, but a reddit post intended for a national or worldwide audience would do better to add context about who or what that name refers to.

* Sometimes, original titles are just bad.  Often a redditor does a better job summarizing the actual content of a post in a title they write.

* Original titles are often very bland and don't convey that the content is interesting, even though it may be very interesting.  Reddit was deliberately designed to let submitters edit a tile so they can convey what's interesting about something, so that people skimming the title list will be able to pick out what they're likely to want to read.

There are a multitude of reasons why a redditor-edited submission title can be superior, sometimes very far superior, to the ""original"" title.  Yet more and more reddits have adopted blanket policies, no exception, of prohibiting that, rather than just saying they'll take down things the mods think are misleading or over-hyped.  They're dragging down the overall quality of reddit, inexorably further downwards, as well as frustrating and embittering many good submitters who've learned how to write good titles.

I'm looking ideally for something under 10 ounces.  I'm *not trying to save money, and willing to pay for something good.*  Also, I wear glasses, so a good *eye relief distance is important*.  Waterproof, durable, fog resistant, fully multicoated, are all things that matter as well.  I realize that for lightweight I'll likely need to go for something with a smaller viewing angle or magnification, and that's a reasonable compromise.  But I'd rather not compromise on other aspects.

Based on our moderation log and moderation queue, I can see that automoderator removed one comment.  I approved that comment, but it still doesn't show up when I look at the post, and I have no idea why.

Not only that, but when I look at OP's comment history, I see that their latest comment on the post is also hidden.  There's nothing in the moderation log, spam queue, or mod queue, about that comment, at all.  It doesn't have reports or need approval.  But when you look at the post, it's not there.

Based on the comment count on the post, there's probably one other comment, perhaps by a different user, that's also hidden.  I don't even know how to find that comment.  It's not in the spam or modqueue.

However, I (a mod of the sub) was able to post a comment, that is visible.

The post itself is still visible in the sub (along with the first few comments).

Of course generic guides to CSS are all over the place, but none of them address what would be useful in the context of reddit.

Just to give one example: By default, if you make link flairs, they get cut off after a certain number of characters.  What puts this limit there by default?  What do you need to put in the link flair CSS to change the limit?

Another example: How does the link flair relate positionally to the post title by default?  What should you put in it to merely move it to the left or right?

Another example: When you apply CSS to a class of link flair, will that style just the flair text, or will it style the title that has that flair applied to it?

These, and plenty of other questions, can be teased out by trial and error, by viewing source and trying to understand the existing CSS, etc.  But shouldn't there be some basic intro guide on reddit that takes you through the basics of writing CSS *for reddit*?

Over the years I've noticed that using up/down votes to rate the quality of identifications, which seemed to be a logical idea, works very poorly in practice.

Partly this is because we have no idea why someone upvoted or downvoted a particular comment.  Many comments don't contain IDs, or suggest more than one ID, or suggest an ID and also have other content.  Using up/down votes in this way also runs up against the ingrained reddit habit of upvoting useful comments, and downvoting comments that don't contribute, increasing the ambiguity of using vote counts to rate ID quality.  For example, sometimes OP leaves a comment with more detail about the context where they took the picture and also suggests what they think it might be.  Did someone downvote that because OP's suggestion was a mistake, or upvote it because the comment provided useful context?  Who knows.

Another big reason this system is counterproductive is that comments with mistaken identifications often spur the discussion that leads to both a more accurate ID and people learning things.  Plenty of times, I've seen posts with weak comments at the top, and then a great thread further down that includes quality discussion and the most accurate IDs.  But because the comment at the top of that thread contains a mistaken ID, it got voted down, so the best thread on the post got pushed down.

----------

Here are the new guidelines in the sidebar:

&gt; **Upvote constructive responses** - ones that you feel are correct IDs or ones that contribute to identifying the post, especially comments that include links or reasons that can help people evaluate them or learn how to identify similar species.  If you feel a comment is *less accurate* or *mistaken*, **don't downvote - comment!**

&gt; Please provide a dissenting opinion if you disagree with an ID, or add a comment with your opinion on the validity of an ID you agree with.  In addition, try to source your IDs and any other background information regarding such identifications, the accuracy, and your confidence levels if applicable.

What consistent difference is there between them, visually?

**Possible ID(s) suggested**: At least one comment suggesting what it is, but it's vague or general (such as telling you what general sort of critter or what family), or not confident (""I think it may be...""), or provided no evidence and you don't know if they're right.

**Identified, probably**: A specific ID is provided, and you think they're right.

**Identified, high confidence**: A specific ID with solid evidence/explanation, or from someone you know has expertise, or you have enough expertise to evaluate and confirm their ID (for example, if it's a bird, you checked allaboutbirds.org and looked at all the ""similar species"" and ruled them out).

**Insufficient for ID**: Your photo/video and whatever other information, has been determined not to be enough to specifically identify it.  But it has been narrowed down as much as possible given the available material.

I have some questions that the FAQs didn't address or did so ambiguously.

1. If there are one or two birds that I need help to identify, is it better to submit an incomplete checklist first, and then a few days later when I've identified the remaining birds, update the existing checklist and change the ""complete checklist"" indicator from no to yes?  Or is it better to wait until I've identified them and only submit the whole checklist once, when it's complete?  Or does it make no difference?

2. How are the traveling, stationary, and area data actually used differently?  The FAQ talks about how they provide data that can be used differently, but this doesn't help me select one in ambiguous cases.  For example, if I'm walking around a very small park for 20 minutes, I could choose ""area"" or ""stationary"" - which is better?

3. Any advice on counting at the same spot over a long time?  For example, at our feeder at home, house sparrows visit frequently.  Say I'm submitting a half day's observations and there were house sparrows there nearly every time we looked, but I never saw more than 4 at a time - should I say 4?  Maybe those were the same 4 sparrows coming back in different combinations.  More likely, there were 25 or more, because I know house sparrows are very very common around here.

4. From the hotspot explorer or map, I can click on any hotspot and get detailed charts and visualizations.  But what about my personal non-hotspot locations?  How can I get the same kind of charts and visualizations for those?  [Edit: Aha!  Instead of first picking a location and then requesting its chart, you have to first choose the kind of chart you want, and then it lets you pick a personal location.]

5. Is it useful to submit overlapping checklists?  Say I spent two hours walking around a reserve.  I saw 6 yellow warblers at one spot at on end of the reserve.  I saw 1 or 2 at a time further along the walk, including 2 at the opposite end of the walk.  Because it was less than a mile from one side to the other, my overall count for the traveling checklist is 6 - I can't tell if I just saw the same ones.  But maybe I should also submit separate stationary checklists for each particular spot, one with 6 and the other with 2, to make it clear where and when they were more specifically?  Or is it a bad idea to have one of my checklists include the same observation(s) already present in another?

6. For that matter, if I do want to submit stationary checklists and the reserve is already a hotspot, should I be making new more specific hotspots at different points in the reserve?

7.  Why are bird counts required to be exact numbers?  For larger numbers, wouldn't it be better to be able to enter an estimate or range?  Like, I saw 15-20 of this;  I saw 80-130 of that.  Or ""about 100"" might be another way of expressing ""80-130"".  It seems strange to have to pick one specific number within a range, and not be able to express that it's inexact.",birding,eBird newbie questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/birding/comments/4ik42d/ebird_newbie_questions/

Various car rental companies have various different annoying ways of handling tolls, most of which involve charging you a daily fee that costs more than the tolls themselves, and is charged even on days you don't actually drive through any tolls.  Sometimes I get billed separately by Florida for toll-by-plate, months later, and have to pay it myself - and sometimes the rental company charged a fee in addition to that.  Figuring out which rental company has sensible policies each time I make a reservation gets annoying.

Maybe getting my own Sunpass and bringing it with me on every trip would make things easier, but I'm not sure - reading stuff online has left me a bit confused, with questions like:

* Do I need to somehow re-register my Sunpass for each new rental car's make, model, and plate number?

* Might some rental companies still bill me for tolls even if I have the Sunpass?

* Can I just buy a Sunpass at a local store and use it right away, or would I need to go online to register it or something first?

Anyone know how having your own Sunpass works in reality when you're an occasional visitor using rental cars?  Is it easier and cheaper than figuring out each rental company's toll billing system and picking an appropriate one for each trip?

[Edit: I honestly would probably visit Florida a bit more often if the toll stuff were less annoying, or if they took EZ-Pass like all other states on the eastern side of the country do.  But I don't have a Florida legislator to complain to, since I don't live there :/ ]",florida,Sunpass for visitors,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/4i1z4p/sunpass_for_visitors/

        forwarders { RFC.1918.IP.ADDR; };
    };

That zone is not signed, so our nameserver's forwarding fails.  It won't serve results to queries for that domain; it tries to get answers from the forwarder IP, complains that they're not signed, and returns NXDOMAIN.

If we change to ""dnssec-validation yes"" then the forwarded zone is fine, as long as we don't set up a trust anchor - but so are any other unsigned zones, I think.  So it still seems like all or nothing.  If we created our own local trust anchor I think the forwarded zone would start failing again.

Which is great, because if Clinton doesn't win a majority of pledged delegates, that means Sanders *does* have a majority - only two candidates have pledged delegates.  But there shouldn't be any need to contest the convention in that case, unless the superdelegates want to overturn the pledged delegate winner - something I don't think they would do.  If this is all about ""we won't let the superdelegates give Clinton the nomination if Sanders wins the primaries"", then that's cool.

But many (most?) of these articles are written as if what he's actually saying is that the Sanders campaign will contest the convention if Clinton doesn't win enough pledged delegates to have a majority of *all* delegates.  In other words, even if Clinton gets a majority of pledged delegates, if it's still possible to beat her by getting more superdelegates, then we'll contest the convention.  Are these articles interpreting what he's saying correctly?  It's hard to tell because the actual quotes don't address this distinction and some of the articles are too ambiguous.

If this latter interpretation is correct, it's terrible!  It's saying that even if Clinton wins the primaries and ends up with more pledged delegates than Sanders (and thus, a majority of pledged delegates), the campaign will still contest the convention and try to get the nomination through superdelegates.  That's exactly the antidemocratic possibility we were all railing against back in January and February.

So does anyone here know what the campaign's actual intent or policy is?

Is it a) fight to make sure that the pledged delegate winner becomes the nominee, and don't let superdelegates give Clinton the nomination if Sanders beats her in pledged delegates, or b) even if Clinton beats Sanders in pledged delegates, contest the convention if it's mathematically possible to get enough superdelegates to give Sanders the nomination despite that?",SandersForPresident,What specifically is the Sanders campaign saying about contesting the convention?,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4dthaf/what_specifically_is_the_sanders_campaign_saying/

I'm familiar with the Democratic party's process of choosing delegates, which is pretty consistent from state to state.  In states that hold primaries, once the primary has allocated *how many* delegates (statewide and by district) each candidate should get, separate caucuses are held for each campaign to select delegates.  Each campaign puts forward their delegate lists.  So for example if Sanders wins 20 and Clinton wins 18 from a particular state, then 20 people put forward by the Sanders campaign and 18 people put forward by the Clinton campaign become delegates to the national convention.

Republicans have far looser rules nationally, so there's a lot more variation by state, but in general, most Republican state parties separate delegate selection from their presidential primaries or caucuses.  A typical Republican primary state, for example, would hold a primary that allocates a certain *number of delegates* to each campaign, but then a party caucus is held where a bunch of individual people run for delegate slots - these people aren't coming from the winning campaigns, and don't have to be supporters of any of those candidates.  So for example if a state's primary allocates their 15 delegates as going 6 for Trump and 6 for Cruz and 3 for Rubio, they may then hold a party caucus electing 15 individuals to be delegates, and it could be that all 15 of those are personally Jeb Bush supporters.  They're just bound, on the first ballot, to vote 6 for Trump 6 for Cruz 3 for Rubio.  On the second ballot, they can choose anyone else.

Actually, based on what I've read, it sounds like on the first ballot the delegates from most states don't actually vote themselves.  Rather, the state chair casts votes on their behalf, for the candidates who won delegates.  But that may not matter.

What *does* matter, and what I can't find the answer to, is how each state decides *which individual delegates* are bound to particular candidates.  One reason this could matter a lot is that several candidates who have dropped out did win some delegates, and many states' rules say that those delegates can become unbound.

Let's say in our hypothetical 15-delegate state above, instead of 15 Jeb Bush supporters, they actually elected 10 Cruz supporters and 5 Trump supporters.  Let's also say that by that state's rules, the Rubio delegates are unbound because he dropped out.  That means 3 of that state's delegates get to vote for the candidate of their choice *on the first ballot*.  But... WHICH THREE?  Is that 3 extra votes for Trump, or 3 extra votes for Cruz?

I realize this will vary state by state, but I haven't been able to find an explanation for any state yet, let alone all of them for which it matters.",Ask_Politics,How do Republican state parties choose which individual delegates will be bound to which candidate?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/4dobg5/how_do_republican_state_parties_choose_which/

It feels like the AskReddit mods hijacked what AskReddit was and turned it into something else (something much less good), but they still have the userbase, and I can't find anything to replace it that everyone else also knows about.  Maybe if there's a small subreddit that wants to take its place, the AskReddit mods would be willing to publicize that, but is there one?",NoStupidQuestions,"Are there any subreddits like AskReddit before they banned the text box?

Rather, the position of the ""current line"" advanced on the screen, until it reached the bottom, then it wrapped around to the top.  You could see where the current line was (usually because the line after it was blanked, but it could be by color), and all the rest of the text stayed put where it was, until it got overwritten when the current line reached it.

IRC2 (which for years was the most common client) added a ""/set scroll"" option to allow you to switch to standard scrolling, where the current line is always at the bottom and stuff scrolls off the top.  Later, other IRC clients became more popular and they just had standard scrolling and didn't do the old irc style at all.  irssi mostly replaced irc2 for unix text mode irc, and it didn't have irc style scrolling.

I really like the old style because I hate it when the text I'm reading keeps moving!  On active channels with lots of conversation it's very jumpy and annoying.  I much prefer the text I'm looking at to stay where it is on the screen.  And I still have a very old irc2 install on one of my servers, where I do much of my irc'ing from.

Since I discovered Big Cypress, I usually go there too, for passerine birds, but this question is specifically about the Everglades:

When are the best times of year to see larger numbers and interesting behavior there.  Egrets/herons/night herons, spoonbills, storks, gallinules &amp; moorhens, pelicans, cormorants, anhingas, various raptors, coots, teals and other duck-like birds, shorebirds, etc.

I'm not just looking for rare species or more species, I'm possibly even more interested in abundance.  The more birds there are, the more interesting behaviors I'm likely to see, just due to probabilities.  For example, although I've seen anhingas on every visit, I haven't seen them actually catch fish and eat them every time - but the times when I saw very abundant anhingas, I did see several of them do so.  I've also enjoyed seeing herons and egrets jostle for hunting territory and occasionally chase one another away, which is another thing I won't see when there are few birds.

Of my trips so far, by far the best was at the beginning of March a couple of years ago.  #2 was a new years trip, when I was there Dec 30 - Jan 2.  Worst one ever was just this past January, around the 20s of the month, but that was due to this winter's very strange weather so is probably a fluke.  I've also been a few other times, basically every month from September to March, though I've never gone there between mid-March to mid-September.

Seriously, memrise will invite you to try the mobile apps but they are horrible, and worse, they hide some of their problems from people who don't know better.  For example

* Courses have ""learning levels"" with words or other items for you to learn, and ""multimedia levels"" with material for you to read or watch.  Multimedia levels are often just short text pages explaining what you're about to learn, or clarifying confusing points.  Sometimes they're videos, or comics or other drawings, and sometimes the next learning level is based on assuming you just watched the video or read the explanation.  But the mobile apps silently skip multimedia levels!  You don't even notice anything was skipped, you don't know you even missed something.  This can not only make you miss important stuff, it can also leave you very very confused with some courses.

* Since typing on mobile keyboards is harder, the mobile apps default to a lot more multiple choice and similar hacks for things you *should* be doing typing tests on.  This doesn't actually test your memory nearly as well, since it gives you strong hints, and you end up doing well on things you don't actually know that well.  But since memrise is fooled into thinking you know them, it schedules the next review for further into the future.  As a result, you're much less likely to really learn them, for a long time.

* You might never know that anyone can (and should!) create mems!  Create your own mems to help you remember anything that doesn't already have a mem that's good for you.  It's really helpful, one of memrise's best features.  But you can't create mems on the mobile apps.  (Edit: Looks like they recently added that to the Android app.  Still can't on iOS.)

* Plenty of other flaws, but those should be enough, don't you think?  **AVOID THE MOBILE APPS!**

Once you have gotten used to memrise.com on the web, know how it works, and are familiar with the courses you're taking, *then* you could supplement them with mobile review sometimes.  But *don't do that when you're new*.

Edit: Several mobile users have commented in the apps' defense.  I stand very firmly by my advice, that if you're new to memrise you should stick with the web at first, and only try the apps after you know enough about the courses you're taking and about memrise as a whole to be clearly aware of the apps' flaws.  Then you can make your own tradeoffs.  But, you could read the comments to see what the various arguments are.


#2. Speaking of mems...

Mems are one of memrise's most important learning features, but a few years in, memrise made the choice to hide them by default.

To see meme, click the ""Help me remember this"" button at the bottom when you're learning a new item.  This will make mems appear if there are any for that word/item, and also make a checkbox appear at the bottom of the page (below the mems) that says ""always load mems"".  Check that box, and from then on, memrise will show them to you by default.

When learning new things, browse the existing mems for anything that you won't trivially remember, and pick one that you think will work for you.  Or, think of one of your own, and make it.  Once you choose a mem, it will be show to you any time you get that word/item wrong on a review in the future.  If you make a new mem, it will become available to all other users to choose, too.


#3. Disable ""tapping"" and ""audio"" tests.

Memrise began with two kinds of ways to quiz you on stuff: Multiple choice tests, and typing tests (where you have to enter the answer in a text field with no additional hints).  Over time, they've added two newer kinds of tests, and both of these *can* be a great addition to a course:

""Tapping tests"": For sentences and phrases, you get a bunch of tiles with all the words in the phrase, plus possibly others that don't belong, and you have to pick the right ones and put them in the right order.  Kind of in between plain multiple choice, and a typing test.

""Audio tests"" - Memrise has *always* allowed course creators to create levels where you hear the audio, and then have to type an answer or choose an answer from a multiple choice.  These are not special kinds of tests, these are normal multiple choice or typing tests, just with an audio column as the prompt.  But more recently, memrise added a new kind of audio test that just springs up at random on any course that has audio.  You might be doing a level that prompts you with French text and asks you to type English, and also plays the French audio when you answer... and then for one word memrise decides at random to make you choose from among three audio recordings instead of type the answer.

The huge huge problem with both of these potentially-nice innovations is that memrise enabled them by default for all courses, even though a lot of course creators made a lot of courses without envisioning these kinds of tests, since they didn't exist.  A lot of those course creators are no longer active, but the courses are still there and still great, except that in many cases the new test types make a mess out of them.

For example, think of a course that teaches you the Hebrew word ????? means ""say (to say) (f) (s)"" - it's the feminine singular of ""say"" from the verb ""to say"".  If you get this in a typing test, you can just type ""say"" and get it right.  But if you get this in a tapping test, you're going to have to arrange all those elements in the right order.  And if you forget and arrange them as ""say (to say) (s) (f)"", you're marked wrong!  This is a real example, but far from the only one, of what happens when a new kind of test is added to a course that was created by someone who didn't know that test would ever be added.

[ What should've happened would've been for memrise to have the new tests default to off for all pre-existing courses, and let active maintainers enable them for their courses; maintainers would know whether a course works well with a new test type or not. ]

Fortunately, you can turn off audio and tapping tests for yourself, and avoid these pitfalls.  Click on your user icon at the top right, choose ""settings"" from the dropdown, and go to the ""learning"" tab on the settings screen.  Choose no for both.

#4. Get rid of the timer.

Memrise puts you under time pressure for every kind of test, and there's no good reason for this.  If you don't know the answer, just hit enter and get it marked wrong, rather than waiting for the time to run out.  That's all.

Unfortunately the timer can cause you to make more typos, make it very hard to enter long sentences, give you added difficulty when typing with foreign characters that aren't on your keyboard and take you more time to type, and make you miss things when interruptions happen, such as someone walking by and asking you a question.  So just turn it off.

Unfortunately, memrise doesn't actually have that option.  Many of us have asked for it but they've pretty much ignored us.  They've never even given a real answer as to why, they've just brushed it off.  I guess they like the timer.

Instead, use a user script for your browser.  Here's the one I use with Firefox: http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/174879  (it used to be hosted on userscripts.org but that site is gone, sadly).  The author of that script has a newer, fancier version here: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/5001-memrise-timer-controls

Some users actually like the timer, though based on forum discussions, they're a minority.  If you're part of that minority, you'll figure that out after you run with the timer disabled for a while.  If you miss it, you can always re-enable it by disabling the user script.  But definitely do try memrise.com with the timer disabled for a while!  Chances are, you'll be happier that way, and use memrise more.

#5. Course forums

Every course has its own discussion forum.  It's easy to miss when you're new to memrise.  It's even easier to miss if you fall for the dratted mobile apps, because *mobile apps can't access the forum* at all!  (Remember, **avoid the mobile apps!**).

A course forum is the best place to:

* Report problems with the course itself, such as wrong definitions or missing audio.

* Ask for help with the topic or language you're learning, from other people who may be further along on it and are clearly interested in it.

* Find learning partners to collaborate with offline.

* Make suggestions for improving the course.

* Seeing what other people have brought up, which may help you learn the same course.

* Helping other people who have questions you can answer.


#5. In summary...

1. **Avoid the mobile apps.**  Use memrise.com on the web.

2. Enable mems by default when you first start learning.  **Make new mems** for anything where you don't see a good one for you. Not only can they help you learn, but they're also a contribution to the community.

3. Go to your learning settings, and turn ""tapping tests"" and ""audio tests"" to off.

4. Install a browser script to disable the memrise timer.

5. Visit the course forum for each course you're taking periodically, to see what people are saying or what problems they're reporting.

From my reading, I learned that I would only really be able to do what I want to do (hike a bunch of trails, visit a bunch of coral reefs, etc.) if I had my own rental car.  Since I cannot drive standard (well, I could in a pinch, but I wouldn't trust myself not to ruin the transmission) I reserved an automatic transmission car through Expedia.  Most rental agencies didn't have one available, only standard, but a few had automatics if reserved in advance.  Expedia said the reservation was confirmed, and *then* I booked my flights and confirmed my hotel and some tours and outings.

When I got here, Enterprise rental told me they had no reservation.  They looked at my email from Expedia and said, well, Expedia never told them about it, so it's Expedia's problem, but they have no automatic transmission cars available.  Leaving me stranded, without a way to even get to my accomodation, which is in a bit of an out of the way place (not too long a drive, but no public transit, far too far to walk, and quite expensive by taxi).

That's when I discovered that Expedia support is totally inaccessible!  They only have US phone numbers, which I have no way of calling from here.  They don't even offer a collect call option (though I couldn't even get the mobile phone store to be able to tell me how to make a collect call from here).  Most online services these days offer a way to chat with support on their web site, but Expedia doesn't offer that - only email, which they say they'll answer within 24 hours.

Although I eventually, after wasting a few hours at the airport, found a car that I can have for a day and a half, which means at least I have enough time to see if Expedia responds to my emails and can find me a car, the feeling of being left high and dry with no access to support really sucked.  And the car I did find at the last moment costs as much for a day and a half as the reservation I had made was going to cost for the entire week.  So I may end up paying just as much for a car, but only get one day to use it to see things.  Thanks, Expedia.

If you need to rent a car outside the US, use some other service that provides more flexible and responsive support options.  Avoid Expedia at all costs, or they will leave you stranded and/or cost you lots of extra money and hassle.

Edit: Expedia customer support sent me a form letter rejection of my support request, claiming the email address didn't match the one on my account.  After I went into my account and set my email address and submitted another support request, making sure it was the same address... a few hours later they sent me the same rejection.  So their email customer support is broken and useless too.",travel,"How Expedia may have ruined my vacation, and why you should never ever use Expedia to rent a car outside the US",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/3y1pay/how_expedia_may_have_ruined_my_vacation_and_why/

For the Galapagos part, we're on an organized cruise, but for the days just before and after, we're mostly on our own, and I want data service on my phone.

I've got an unlocked T-Mobile Moto X, but my T-Mobile plan is not one of the ones that include international data service, so I'll probably need a different SIM for this trip.  I don't know if that's something I can get here (Boston MA) in advance, or once I arrive in Ecuador, or what to look for.

I've seen a bunch of web sites with information but they're all vague about exactly where to go, and they all have this vague language about how technically only Ecuador residents are allowed to buy local SIMs but you can usually find a place that will put it in their name and transfer it to you a few days later.  What does that mean?  Will some places refuse to do it while others will?  How do I find one that will without wasting several hours of our very short time there?  And will I actually have to wait a few days until they transfer the SIM to me before I can use it - making it useless because we'll only be in each city a couple of days?

So, what can I do to get data service - unlimited or with a high enough cap that I don't need to think about it - for this short trip, without spending much time when we're actually in Ecuador trying to find a SIM?

Two days in Quito at the beginning, then two days in Guayaquil at the end.

Wildlife is our focus, especially plants and birds, and long day hikes would be fun too, especially in pretty places.  But interesting good food and other cool things also.

Any suggestions?  Especially from your personal experience if you've been there / done them?

In particular, juvenile king angelfish and queen angelfish look very similar and I'm not sure what difference to look for to tell one from the other.  The same seems true for gray angelfish and french angelfish. 

----------
Look at these photos of juvenile queen and king angelfish:

http://www.marinelifephotography.com/fishes/angelfishes/holacanthus-passer.htm

http://www.marinelifephotography.com/fishes/angelfishes/holacanthus-ciliaris.htm

I've got a few more photos on other sites, but those two are enough for my question.  Look at the last photo on the queen angelfish page.  That juvenile's patterns look to me close enough to the juvenile king angelfish photo on the other page that they could be individual variation.  So how do I tell the two species apart at that age?

One difference I see is the pointy fins of the young queen angelfish vs. the rounded king angelfish.  But both of them get pointy as adults, so maybe that's just a difference in age between these two individuals?

Edit: I forgot that juvenile blue angelfish look even *more* like juvenile queen angelfish.  Is there any difference I should look for?

----------

Now, try a google image search for [juvenile gray angelfish](https://www.google.com/search?q=juvenile+gray+angelfish&amp;tbm=isch) and compare to the results for [juvenile french angelfish](https://www.google.com/search?q=juvenile+french+angelfish&amp;tbm=isch).  Which is which?

Since both gray and french angelfish live in the same Caribbean reefs, even knowing where you saw it doesn't help.

I got that one, and it's excellent!  I'm glad I have it and don't regret the purchase.  However, it also has a significant drawback that makes me want something else too...

First, here are some of what's great about this book:

* Comprehensive.  If a fish isn't in here, I almost certainly didn't see it on a Hawaiian reef.  This also means I can identify by process of elimination, which doesn't work with most guides.

* Writeup about (almost) every family of fish, with cool information about their behavior, life stages, relationships to each other, etc.

* Says where each species is located throughout the world, and which ones are endemic, native, or recent introductions in Hawaii - and even which islands they're found at, for those that aren't found throughout Hawaii.

* Scientific name, English common name, and Hawaiian name, for every species.  With notes about variations of the Hawaiian names, and a list of alternate English common names.

Now the drawbacks.  It's the first three that cause me to seek another book, and they fall into a common theme: This book is **not optimized for *visual* identification**.

* For most species there's only one picture, or maybe two if it has different phases or a night mode.  Many species vary a lot, in color, pattern, or shape.  Having several photos of each species (or phase) would give a sense of the range of variation in that species, making it easier to see what differences indicate it's a different species vs. seem to fall within its range.  With one photo, you have to infer that from looking at all the other species in the family, and even if you do that, it can be very ambiguous.

* While there are great identification keys for each family and an identification writeup for each species, these are all designed for someone who's got a fish to dissect in the lab, not for a snorkeler/diver who took some photos.  For example, they talk about differences in the lateral line, but you can't see the lateral line on most fish, so if the key difference between species A and B by this book is that one has a straight line all the way back and the other has a break in the lateral line near the middle, you can't tell.  Or, it tells you about the shape and number of teeth, but you usually can't see the teeth.  So I can't use most of its detailed identification keys and writeups.

* Most pages have only one or two species per page, partly because of the long ID writeup (which I cannot use easily), and partly because the photos are large.  Large photos are really nice, but it makes it really hard to skim through a lot of fish to look for a visual match.  A guide designed for visual identification would have a pair of pages for each family with lots of small images of the species, where you could see the whole family at a glance, quickly pick out the few most likely species, and then flip to the appropriate pages.

* This one's less important than the others, but I really wish there were some notes on each species' quirks &amp; behavior.  In this book he has ""remarks"" for every species, but for a majority of them, remarks are just when and where it was first discovered/identified/documented, by whom, and what food was found in its stomach when dissected.  For *some* species it gives other information, but for most it doesn't.  Also, sometimes that information is in the writeup at the beginning of the family, but a) that doesn't cover all the species in the family individually, and b) it's hard to find when you're looking at a particular species which you identified by its picture.

So, anyone know of a good reef fish identification guide I could get as a companion, that's reasonably comprehensive but much better suited to visual identification?",Hawaii,Best book for reef fish identification?

I know that (some? most?) parrotfish change sex, and change their color dramatically when they do that.  In the initial stage, they are female, and then some but not all of those later change to a terminal stage, in which they're male.  But in some places I see the terms male, female, and juvenile used, rather than initial and terminal.  My questions:

1. Do all, or nearly all, parrotfish species start female and then some change to male and some don't?  Or is that just some species, while others follow a different patterns?

2. Are the terms ""male"" and ""female"" interchangeable with ""terminal phase"" and ""initial phase"", or are there some parrotfish species for which one set of terms is more appropriate and other species for which the other set is more appropriate?

3. Do all parrotfish species have a separate juvenile phase (with its own color pattern), before their initial stage?  Do juveniles have a sex?

I saw that [someone posted this question 2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/1btj8v/whats_your_favorite_book_for_reef_and_otherfish/) but the only answer given was Keoki's web site, marinelifephotography.  I definitely use that, along with reefguide.org, but I want a book:

* More comprehensive than either of these sites, I think.

* The way a book is organized can make it much easier to find the fish even if it is on the web sites.

I got a nice little fish ID book for Florida's reefs and even though it's not comprehensive and I'm sure there are better ones out there, it still made a big difference for me in ease of identifying fish I see when snorkeling there.  So I'd like a really good one for Hawaiian fish.

Any recommendations?  Especially from people who actually use books to identify fish, and who've tried more than one book even?

P.S. So far /r/species has been the best thing for fish I can't easily identify from keoki/reefguide/etc., but only about half the ones I post there get unambiguously identified.

Then I learned I could use the paid version of QuickTime, so I bought that and tried it.  Unfortunately, about 2/3 of the time when I want to merge a group of videos in QuickTime Pro, the resulting video gets weird psychedelic color shifts at random place.  It's very consistent about which groups of videos that happens with, so if I try to merge some videos and get the weird color stuff, trying again with the same videos will produce the same result.

After searching around and asking for suggestions, I eventually found iSkySoft video converter.  Although its UI is wonky and weird, it just plain worked and was simple enough to use once I got used to it.  I've been using it for a few years.

Today, it got upgraded, and now none of the videos it produces are playable.  Whether I play them in Finder preview or QuickTime Player, they just give me a still image of the first frame, as the audio plays through.  If I click somewhere on the timeline to jump to that point in the video, I get a still image of that frame, but no video.  All my other video files still play just fine; only ones produced by the new version of iSkySoft have this problem.

So perhaps it's time to look around for something else, perhaps less buggy and with a cleaner UI.  My criteria are:

* Easy to crop videos, rearrange them, and output a merged single video.

* Can handle a wide variety of formats.

* Fairly quick and not too memory hungry.  IOW, not anything like iMovie.  All the others I've seen seem fine.

* Works on OS X 10.8 and up.

* I'm willing to pay, but first I want to try the software out, uncrippled at least for basic features.  Nothing that watermarks the videos, yuck!  After I use it for a bit if it's good I would pay for it.

Any recommendations or discrecommendations?

BTW if you know how to solve the QuickTime Pro problem (I've asked about this here before but got no solutions) or know what's up with iSkySoft's new version and have a workaround, feel free to tell me about that!",applehelp,Recommend software for cropping and joining videos?,http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/3eok76/recommend_software_for_cropping_and_joining_videos/

I've seen this help other people remember words, too.  So I'm putting a few songs in my Hebrew course on memrise, that fit in with what words and phrases people are learning.

Here's the course, if you want to look:
http://www.memrise.com/course/702355/hebrew-reading-and-language-intro/49/

What I'm looking for are songs I can add that meet these criteria (or most of them):

1. Vocabulary that the learner will mostly know.  If a song is mostly words on a particular theme that makes it easier for me to add a level to the course with much of that vocabulary just before the song.  Songs with mostly simpler vocabulary, and fewer obscure words, are best at this stage, but are harder to find.  Repetition in the chorus also helps.

2. Songs that are either likely to be already familiar to the learner (I expect a high proportion of learners would be Jewish, so Passover and Chanukah songs that are used in English speaking countries are good candidates) or that are very widely known in Israel (for example, I have Beshana Haba'a already in the course).

3. The song needs to have a high quality YouTube video I can embed, where the singer's voice is clear enough for people who don't speak Hebrew to easily recognize words they do know, and with Hebrew captions/subtitles so they can read along as they hear, and get practice recognizing words they've learned in both writing and sound.

I'm going to continue to look for songs like this on my own, but would love to get suggestions if you can think of any that meet these criteria and that you've found a good video for (with Hebrew captions).",hebrew,Suggest songs to use in my memrise Hebrew course?,http://www.reddit.com/r/hebrew/comments/3dr4ze/suggest_songs_to_use_in_my_memrise_hebrew_course/

I feel like I've never or almost never heard them.  Like, does anyone ever use those?  Or have they fallen out of use in modern Hebrew?  Or maybe they're just used in books and fancy speeches but never in conversation?

For example, future tense masculine plurals ""atem tachshevu"" and ""hem yachshevu"", great, feels normal.  But ""aten tachshovna""?  ""hen tachshovna""?  Does anyone say that?
