Beware of those breeding for 'rare' colours and other non-standard traits (merle pembrokes are not possible without cross breeding to another breed for example, and paying purebred/health tested prices or higher for a mix is not a good thing). Heath testing should include OFA or PennHip for Hips, Eyes certified by a board certified ophthalmologist and can also include DNA testing for vWD, DM and long coat. Also beware of breeders only testing for one trait (like DM), as it is only looking at one aspect of breeding and not taking everything into consideration. Any breeder that is a member of the PWCCA abides by a strict code of ethics and is a great resource for you.

Working with mentors and a good reproductive veterinarian is important when venturing into breeding. 

I try to be as respectful of the people I work with as possible. If they live nearby, I will pick up the bitch from them for vet appts for progesterone testing and breeding while they are in heat (sometimes daily over a week or so). I then return her full time to her people until it's time for an ultrasound to confirm pregnancy. About a week to 10 days prior to whelping the bitch comes to stay with me and is with me to raise the litter until they are about 8 weeks old or so.

In my breed it is very rare to ask for a puppy in lieu of a fee. 

If you're referring to the OP as the bitch owner in this case, I would expect that the bitch would be either legally owned by her colleague as I do, OR she would be leased for the litter via the AKC. Should the breeder be paying for all the testing, breeding costs, raising puppies etc, the OP would not have rights to a pup unless agreed in advance. IE: instead of the OP paying anything for the bitch, the breeder retains breeding rights in return for no sale price. Or if the bitch is sold, asking for a puppy or other remuneration would be expected. Clear as mud?",2016-10-25 18:00:58+00:00,d97bqdx,3,t1_d977qxh,4829,dogs
39,"I was hailed! I'm a longtime breeder of PWCs. I have often placed dogs in 'shared' homes for the good of the dog - not all dogs thrive in a house with multiple dogs so having their own family is a great thing. In this case I retain legal (CKC or AKC) ownership of the dog, but they live elsewhere. I typically place dogs in homes like this at a portion of the normal cost in return for me borrowing their dog to have a litter or two, and sometimes the odd show (though most dogs I place like this are already Champions). The 'co-owner' is responsible for day to day care of the dog, while I am responsible for anything associated with breeding - health tests, breeding expenses, care of the bitch while they are in my home. The co-owner has no input in the choice of sire, where the puppies are placed, nor do they have rights to any of the puppies produced. They can request to purchase a puppy from the litter and are placed first on the waiting list after my choices are made, and any choices of the stud owner if any. Any decisions that are made are in the best interest of the dog before all others. I will not risk the health of a bitch in any situation and will forfeit my right to a litter should there be any cause for concern. 

Now for my thoughts on what you are asking... As a breeder, I have studied pedigrees, genetics and my breed extensively for many decades. Why would someone who has none of that experience want to dictate how I choose to breed? I'm not trying to be rude in any way, please understand that - but if your colleague has this knowledge, why not defer to them? Their offering is reasonable and it sounds like they have the best interest of your pup in mind. Personally I've found that offering a dog to a home at a portion of the normal price, in return for them having to be without their dog for a couple of months is worth it for everyone. The dog is happy with their own family, I have fewer long term dogs to split my attention between in my home but still have access to a few dogs to continue my breeding programme. Putting all your eggs in one basket as a breeder is a scary thing and this allows for some options for all parties involved.

Or liver shunts? For example the DM test we have available is only identifying 1 of many genes (up to 4 more have been discovered this year) and thus at this time removing 'at risk' dogs from breeding programs that may not have the other triggering genes is actually causing more damage to the genepool than keeping them. Generally the breed is a healthy one and can be quite long lived should they be kept in appropriate weight. Honestly, obesity in corgis is the #1 cause of health issues.

43,"in my opinion - yes. Recent studies are pointing to it being beneficial for growth to wait until they are little older before spaying or neutering. This allows the hormones to be present while they are in various growth periods and and can help with better bone densities, lower rates of issues like cruciate ligament tears and a few other things I'm not remembering. I personally ask my puppy people to wait until they are over a year before spaying their puppies. This gives time for them to reach full size and hopefully their growth plates are starting to close off. Allowing them to have a single heat VERY minimally can increase their risk of developing mammary cancer later in life (some studies are not agreeing), but the slight increased risk is outweighed by the other side in my opinion. I'd recommend googling early spay and neuter, but [here](http://www.akcchf.org/news-events/news/health-implications-in-early.html) is a recent study. and [another](http://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2013/09/30/neutering-health-risks.aspx)",2016-10-14 19:35:45+00:00,d8s6cr4,3,t1_d8qvibk,77846,corgi

That said, I seem to have a group of girls in particular that does lose their guard hairs with their undercoat shed at least once a year. It's totally normal for them. The best thing you can do is to give them a good bath, and then thoroughly comb all over down to the skin daily for the next while as they shed it all out. If the guard hairs are coming out a comb won't catch them, but you can 'strip' them like what is done with a wire coat on a terrier by gently tugging on the guard hairs in the same direction as the growth. If they are loose they will come out with a gentle tug. There are [stripping blades/knives](https://www.cherrybrook.com/aaronco-magna-carder-carding-tool/) that you can also purchase that help catch these hairs. I've also used a butter knife in a pinch.

55,"Personally I don't like getting phone calls. I run a business and work full time on top of my 2nd job ;) of having corgis. It's not appropriate for me to be talking to a slew of people through business hours about puppies, and often when I get home I want/need to focus on caring for my dogs and having some downtime. Emails work best for me as it allows me to respond when I do have time to do so. Sometimes that's quickly and sometimes I'm forced to let emails build up for a month or so depending on how busy I am. 

From the feedback I see on various breeder forums, the things that tend to ensure no reply are email inquiries that include no information on you, often only a question about cost and show no research has been done on the breed. Most breeders are older so some formality is appreciated in the emails - address them by name if possible, sign the message with your name, location, and contact info etc. 

I absolutely worry about my security and that of my dogs. Most reputable breeders are not running a business, it's a hobby and a passion, and it's out of our homes. Personally I don't typically ask to meet someone until I've had a few good messages back and forth, or if I do it's in a public location on a walk. I also have to worry about viruses being brought in if I have young puppies that only have maternal immunity. I typically defer any visits until pups are old enough for their vaccinations.

Inbreeding: in dogs there are only a couple ways to truly inbreed. Siblings, mother/son, father/daughter. They don't quite have the same level of issues that humans do when producing offspring that are closely related. Even in humans, the issues typically pop up only after a few generations of inbreeding. In dogs if we choose to line breed (where some of the ancestors are common within the first 3~ generations) we do so to ensure we are locking in desired traits in health, structure and temperament. A good breeder will have researched the pedigree of the prospective parents back for generations for all these traits. Many breeders will line breed and then outcross periodically to unrelated lines to bring in the traits they are lacking. Knowing what is behind the dogs back generations is extremely important when breeding as those traits can pop up in new generations. In my opinion this is an important step that tends to be lacking in most BYB lines. ",2016-07-17 17:09:01+00:00,d5fs7mj,6,t1_d5dzvff,148098,corgi

90,"Oh wow, I'm really sorry. I hope that you were both able to seek medical attention. Dog bites often require a tetanus vaccination and antibiotics (I just went through this when a friends dog bit me at a dog show just a few weeks ago). 

This is very serious. I hope you don't mind me asking a few questions. Where did you get this dog from? Was it a rescue? individual rehoming? shelter? Did the people rehoming the dog give you any indication that there were behavioural issues? Was he checked by a vet before coming to you? Is he up to date on his vaccinations? Has he growled or shown any other warning signs before lashing out?

Your concerns about him continuing to bite are absolutely valid. I would forgive a dog once in a stressful situation, but considering he's bit again this is beyond that. Assuming that this dog is not in pain where he may he lashing out due to medical issues, biting is not something to be taken lightly. I would not trust this dog with other people or dogs if he is biting his owners. After a couple of weeks he should be relatively comfortable in your home and with you. My opinion is that you've likely been passed a dog with a history of issues because someone else didn't want to take responsibility and do what was right. Returning this dog to the organization where you got him from is a good option if it was a rescue or shelter.  

1. I would recommend talking to the people you got him from to see if there is a history of biting. 
2. Take him to the vet to rule out any medical issues. 
3. Don't beat yourself up. Wavering is justified! It's not fair to you or him to be living in a situation like this where you are living in fear of being bit. 
4. The hard reality of a dog of this age and biting history, that often the best thing to do is humane euthanasia. From a liability standpoint, you cannot pass this dog off onto another family where he could bite again. From his quality of life... what's causing it? If he's constantly fearful (and fear aggression is one of the hardest to deal with as it's very unpredictable) is that fair to ask him to live like that? If he's resource guarding you may be able to work with it, but it's a long road that requires professional intervention. Often people prefer to get rid of problems dogs so someone else has to deal with the harsh and heartbreaking reality. 

I'm really sorry you're in this situation. I hope that I'm wrong in my assumption of his previous history and that this is something that can be worked through. If you wish to talk further, please feel free to PM me.

93,"Glad to hear you following all the right steps! The AKC is just a registry, it only ensures that certain aspects are followed but cannot necessarily police the quality of the dogs produced or the care the breeder takes with them. The PWCCA does ensure that their members follow a code of ethics and has a rigorous process to become a member. Most of the members of the affiliate clubs also abide by the same COE and are a reasonably safe bet. 

As for heath testing, the PWCCA asks that member breeders certify eyes by an ophthalmologist and Hips be checked out likely with OFA (or other equivalents). It does not insist on vWD (though the majority of the breeders do want to test for and work away from this) and many are testing for DM as well. I will caution you on the DM test though, it is only looking at one of many likely gene involvements so despite the fact there are a high number of PWCs tested 'at risk' many will not become affected by DM in their older years. There are a lot of BYB types waving around DM clear/carrier as a certificate of health, but when you're not looking at all the other possible issues from a long term standpoint, you could be creating even more problems and heartbreak. Poor structure can lead to increased risk of back problems or cruciate ligament tears as examples. Personally I test my dogs for Hips, Eyes, vWD, DM, and sometimes fluff, but I will not shy away from a breeding that may produce DM at risk puppies at this time. The overall health and longevity of my own line and those lines I choose to breed into are more important than a single test. That said, I'd still want to be working with a breeder that was also testing for most, if not all, of these things if I was to be purchasing a well bred puppy. 

The breeder you mentioned does have some red flags for me... not allowing you to see their property at some point (I'll admit I don't allow first meetings at my home for my personal safety and privacy), not meeting you prior to placing you on their list, not introducing you to at least the potential dam of the litter...

The fact the dog is a pit doesn't bother me at all. Every dog is different in temperament, if trained and socialized they can make lovely pets or not. I've certainly met some NASTY poorly bred corgis over the years. I've also met many lovely lovely bully breeds and in fact was just badly bit by a brittany spaniel at a show last week.

If the coat is packed or felted down the air cannot circulate and this can cause many issues, including skin infections. If you can't groom your pup yourself, please take them to a groomer for a bath and blow-dry ONLY. The only trimming needed is the bottoms of their feet. This is where they sweat and lose heat. Trim the feet, nothing else. I use a metal comb on my dogs at least weekly. It takes only a few minutes to get through their whole coat if they are regularly maintained.

You just need some masking tape to start, and a friend to help! I start taping by sticking 2 fingers into the ear and putting it into what would be the natural upright position. Gently roll the ear around your fingers to create a column. Start with a strip of masking tape on the back right at the base of the ear where it attaches to the head, and wrap it around the ear.

150,"[Visual guide to the below discussion](http://imgur.com/HQrqpuH). To get it out of the way, from a quick look the queen's vs modern are different in colouring (generally we find white markings more pleasing so they have been selected more in breeding programmes) and in coat. Coats are fuller and thicker now both from selection and from nutrition, but also this is a show groomed dog, vs an ungroomed one. It's amazing how puffy a dog looks after a bath and a blow dry! This will of course make them look bigger and lower than they really are than if you saw them dripping wet or ungroomed. 

Pic 1 is the skeleton of what would be a considered a modern Pem. Just helps you see where the bones are and what they look like. The main bones we're interested in for this discussion are the shoulder blade &amp; upper arm in the front, Femur and Tibia/fibula in the rear. Ideally on most dogs it is desired to have a 90Ëš angle between these sets of bones, for these sets to be approximately equal in length, and for the angles to be the same in the front as they are in the rear. Just looking at the two dogs standing, you can see the older dog is leaning forward and the majority of the weight of the dog's frame is being pushed forward. The less than 45Ëš angle of the shoulder blade to the top line, means that the dogs neck is shorter as well. The modern dog has a strong shoulder that is set well under the body to support the weight of his frame. The shoulder supports the majority of the dogs weight, while the rear is the propulsion. If the queen's dog has a closer to 90Ëš angle in his rear bones, his top line might be straighter and his rear in line with his shoulders instead of high. 

This 90Ëš allows them to have the maximum range of movement with the least amount of effort. (see the plc of the dog moving). A dog that has a shorter upper arm than shoulder blade like the Queen's dog won't have the range of motion in the front and will have a choppier gait, that would impact through the body... making the top line bounce instead of being firm for example. Any extra movement is wasted energy. The open angle in the rear will mean that the dog has less shock absorption as well as less ability to gain force to push with it's rear as the angle is already in a more open position. Balance and efficiency is key in any living being. It's about ensuring the maximum can be done with the least effort and the least chance of injury. An unbalanced dog, like the queen's would likely be at higher risk for injuries, would tire faster etc. 

Honestly I get rather frustrated by the types of comparisons where people are staying to compare a random older dogs with a random modern one. If you look at the link posted elsewhere in this thread, and compare it to what I've discussed above, you will see that from a purely structural standpoint dogs have been improved for the better. And just because we now know about health issues, it does not mean that purebreds are LESS healthy than a mix would be. In fact many vets, my own included will easily say that the dogs in their practice that are the healthiest are those from responsible pure bred breeders who are health testing and breeding for improvement. I know many people in the dog world from breeder, to groomers, to trainers and daycare owners. I've heard time and again that the dogs that have the most need for surgeries due to injuries are not the well bred purebreds, but the BYB dogs or even mixed breeds that end up with unfortunate structural problems that lead to their bodies breaking down from normal activities. And with that I step off my soap box ;) I hope this helps explain why we breeders look for specific types of structure on our dogs and don't only breed based on personality traits.

151,"Well bred corgis are certainly not getting smaller. The standard looks for bitches averaging 25lbs and dogs being 28lbs. I have seen a trend in BYBs who are looking for a niche market, breeding for smaller which typically means less bone thickness. 

While there is an illusion of dogs getting lower, the standard has not really changed in regards to that. What has happened is that the angulation of the dogs shoulders and rear has increased so that they are structurally more sound than they once were, this has made them seem lower. Legs are not getting shorter, just the angles of the shoulder blade to the upper arm have become closer to the 90Ëš ideal. ",2016-04-19 19:51:29+00:00,d29atz3,1,t3_4fibzm,13161,corgi

If my adult girls are 23-26 lbs I'm happy. Boys 26 - 30 lbs. Maturity at 3-4 years will often mean a fair bit more muscle density and thus weight gain.

2. remove yourself from playing for a while and ignore the pup. Be still if he's chewing on you. A moving target is MUCH more fun than one who isn't interacting.
3. redirect to suitable toys over your hands. 
4. If this doesn't work, pinch the back of the neck fairly hard and say no when he does bite too hard. This is similar to what a littermate or older dog would do to them.

189,"&gt;Von willebrands is a clotting disease more common in inbreeding but you can see problem when is cut, little cuts bleed a ton. 

vWD is a clotting disease yes. Inbreeding or line breeding or even outcrossing has NOTHING to do with it. There are 3 types of vWD. Pems have type 1 (of 3) and this is the mildest form of the disease. This means that pems that carry 2 copies of the vWD gene ('affected') will have less clotting factor, dogs with 1 copy and 1 good (carrier) can produce more clotting factor, and those with 2 copies can produce the most. A pem with 2 copies of the gene will likely never display clinical signs. A contentious breeder will be screening so they know what direction to take on future breedings not pretending it doesn't exist because they didn't check. That's like saying their dogs don't have Hip Dysplasia, but have never had an x-ray done. 

So yeah, confirmed! Move on.

Beware of those breeding for 'rare' colours and other non-standard traits (merle pembrokes are not possible without cross breeding to another breed for example, and paying purebred/health tested prices or higher for a mix is not a good thing) A well bred pup is going to take some time to get - be sure to provide lots of information about yourself when contacting people, you're bound to get a better response.

Preventives like keeping them in light weight, well muscled and even some regular chiropractic or physic could help. ",2016-02-12 00:58:01+00:00,czwqfss,1,t3_45bysu,2461,corgi

I have 2 crates permanently in my vehicle to ensure my dogs are safe while driving. My dogs all sleep in their crates at night. Where you put the crate is up to you.

248,"I agree with much of what /u/tokisuishi has said. We don't see a split in the breed between show and working lines. A soundly built dog is a soundly built dog. We have amazing entries at our National Specialty in the performance events (herding, agility, Obedience, Rally etc) and many of the competitors are also AKC Champions. 

I will also say that coat has a lot to do with how a dog looks as well. I have seen many byb bred dogs that have a much tighter, flatter coat than the typical show lines. It can make them appear much more svelte than their counterparts. Depending on grooming, food, genetics, and shedding patterns, coat can really change the look of a dog.

290,"LOL. Honestly, we've never seen this particular colour show up in our lines nor have we had a bluie. Of course you never know what is going to show up when recessives are involved. I did have a litter of pups with 'fever coat' a few years ago. Just about gave me a heart attack. But after a LOT of research, it was determined that the dam had had a mild fever around the time of coat development which affected the initial coats they were born with. The pups ended up looking like [silver tipped tris](https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/11666278_10153060929880777_5890955971667596051_n.jpg?oh=c4022570b09b12820774406d3f23395d&amp;oe=5730755F) until their adult coats came in.

While there are things that are classified as faults in the standard, some are less worrisome than others. This particular type of lack of red intensity, fluffs, minor mismarks (keeping in mind the reason we avoid breeding mismarks is that there is deafness associated mostly with head white) are all things that shouldn't be bred for, but also don't affect the dogs ability to be a good companion. I personally feel that as a breeder we have to weigh ALL the factors when choosing what dogs we are going to breed. If a stud that matches my girl carries this intensity issue I'd keep it in mind, but I certainly wouldn't discount him solely for that reason. That said... more unscrupulous 'puppy producers' may wish to capitalize on these 'rare' things to make a buck and not look at the bigger picture. A good breeder will carefully place these types of pups in the right homes on non-breeding contracts for the long term good of the breed. ",2016-01-27 22:22:56+00:00,czeel2r,5,t1_czed79f,1945,corgi

293,"I was hailed! 

Winston and other similar corgis are what we've started calling ['Silvers'](http://imgur.com/a/qwzo3). The reason for this is that they are a silvery grey tone at birth instead of a typical mousy brown. What we've determined is that it's a dilution of the red pigment (phaeomelanin), but it leaves the black pigment (eumelanin) untouched. It's likely a simple recessive gene that is showing up on occasion, but we're now able to see more of these dogs occurring both with the embracing of social media and with breeders no longer being witch hunted over occurrences like this. 

There are no known health risks associated with this lack of intensity in the red pigment. If a dog was a true dilute (as in ALL the pigment becomes diluted including noses and eyes - which we refer to as bluie in the breed) there are added skin issues association with that type of dilution. 

So while the PWC standard calls for red shades to be from fawn to irish setter in colour, this just means that these cream coloured dogs are outside of what makes a corgi typically a corgi. As tokisushi has already stated, beware of anyone specifically breeding for 'rare' or outside standard colours. Other wise they would make a lovely companion, just like a fluff or otherwise mismarked dog. 

You can [read up](http://www.doggenetics.co.uk/albino.html) on this pigment intensity here. ",2016-01-27 19:46:13+00:00,cze7kp4,1,t3_42yqeo,6008,corgi

I think the most important thing is to find *reputable* breeders of the breeds you're interested in. There are BYBs and mills and people in it for money. If you find a good breeder who understands their breed and aims to breed for mental and physical soundness as well as over all health. They will know what the predominant issues are in the breed and be able show you test results. Of course no breeder is going to be able to 100% guarantee anything. Stuff happens. Mother Nature still rules so matter how careful we are.

Lack of health testing - nothing reported on their site, and also no dogs show up with the kennel name Wits End on the OFA database which means Hips have likely not been cleared for hip dysplasia. Other testing is important too, but there is no mention of testing for any of these issues. 

Lack of titles - the point of dog shows and other activities (like herding, agility, tracking) is to ensure the breed is structurally sound and mentally sound to be able to do a variety of tasks, including what they were originally bred to do. Dog shows also help people strive to improve the breed in these ways and not just breed for pets and profit. 

Using 'breeding pairs' or only breeding to their own dogs - Most reputable breeders will search far and wide to find the 'perfect' boy for their girl and only rarely breed to their own males. (the sire of one of my last litters was in CA, I live in Canada) This helps to ensure a broad gene pool, and that specific traits are selected to try to improve structural and mental soundness over 'just producing companions'. A great companion with structural faults could have issues later in life with increased risks of strains and tears.

385,"I donâ€™t want a show dog; I just want a pet.
by Joanna Kimball (A Cardi Breeder and blogger) 


This is one of the most pervasive sentiments that puppy buyers, especially families, express when they're looking for a dog. What they really mean, of course, is that they don't want a show BREEDER â€“ don't want to pay the high price they think show breeders charge, don't want to go through the often-invasive interview process, and think that they're getting a better deal or a real bargain because they can get a Lab for $300 or a Shepherd for $150.

I want you to change your mind. I want you to not only realize the benefits of buying a show-bred dog, I want you to INSIST on a show-bred dog. And I want you to realize that the cheap dog is really the one that's the rip-off. And then I want you to go be obnoxious and, when your workmate says she's getting a puppy because her neighbor, who raises them, will give her one for free, or when your brother-in-law announces that they're buying a goldendoodle for the kids, I want you to launch yourself into their solar plexus and steal their wallets and their car keys.

Here's why:

If I ask you why you want a Maltese, or a Lab, or a Leonberger, or a Cardigan, I would bet you're not going to talk about how much you like their color. You're going to tell me things about personality, ability (to perform a specific task), relationships with other animals or humans, size, coat, temperament, and so on. You'll describe playing ball, or how affectionate you've heard that they are, or how well they get along with kids.

The things you will be looking for aren't the things that describe just ""dog""; they'll be the things that make this particular breed unique and unlike other breeds.

That's where people have made the right initial decision â€“ they've taken the time and made the effort to understand that there are differences between breeds and that they should get one that at least comes close to matching their picture of what they want a dog to be. 

Their next step, tragically, is that they go out and find a dog of that breed for as little money and with as much ease as possible. 

You need to realize that when you do this, you're going to the used car dealership, WATCHING them pry the ""Audi"" plate off a new car, observing them as they use Bondo to stick it on a '98 Corolla, and then writing them a check and feeling smug that you got an Audi for so little. 

It is no bargain.

Those things that distinguish the breed you want from the generic world of ""dog"" are only there because somebody worked really hard to get them there. And as soon as that work ceases, the dog, no matter how purebred, begins to revert to the generic. That doesn't mean you won't get a good dog â€“ the magic and the blessing of dogs is that they are so hard to mess up, in their good souls and minds, that even the most hideously bred one can still be a great dog â€“ but it will not be a good Shepherd, or good Puli, or a good Cardigan. You will not get the specialized abilities, tendencies, or talents of the breed.

If you don't NEED those special abilities or the predictability of a particular breed, you should not be buying a dog at all. You should go rescue one. That way you're saving a life and not putting money in pockets where it does not belong. 

If you want a purebred and you know that a rescue is not going to fit the bill, the absolute WORST thing you can do is assume that a name equals anything. They really are nothing more than name plates on cars. What matters is whether the engineering and design and service department back up the name plate, so you have some expectation that you're walking away with more than a label. 

Keeping a group of dogs looking and acting like their breed is hard, HARD work. If you do not get the impression that the breeder you're considering is working that hard, is that dedicated to the breed, is struggling to produce dogs that are more than a breed name, you are getting no bargain; you are only getting ripped off.",2015-12-15 18:12:59+00:00,cxzzg2p,1,t3_3wynec,3209,corgi

388,"In terms of corgis being 'prone to obesity' I think we can look at genetics to play a role in this case. When considering the history of both breeds, they were developed in a relatively harsh climate that required the animals and people to be 'hardy'. Most of the welsh animals are stocky and needed to be 'easy keepers'. I wouldn't think that their dogs would be any different, and likely the ones who could thrive on a minimal amount of food would be bred on. 

I always make it clear to prospective corgi owners, that they are the problem if their dog gets fat. I show them how to check their dogs weight on an adult dog and remind them to do so often. I also 'joke' that if I see their corgi fat I will hunt them down and repossess the dog. I'm not a nice vet who is worried about hurting feelings. You get one of my pups fat and I will tell you very bluntly. As already pointed out by the OP, health risks include HD, IVDD and a myriad of others. Fat corgis are not cute. The owners who let them get that way are killing them. There is no other way to put it.

394,"We're just starting to allow safe/trusted visitors into the house to meet the pups. Without much of an immune system we have to be careful! 

Temperament tests are done at 7 weeks of age. They're pretty basic and for the most part we already know what their raw temperament is like, though it can sometimes help determine if a pup will need a fair bit of socialization, or an experienced owner etc.

We don't do conformation assessments until 8 weeks - it's seem to be the closest growth wise to what they will be as adults. We find some lines have different growth rates than others and that date can change, sometimes 10 weeks, sometimes 12. We've taken standing photos of our dogs at 8 weeks for many generations and knowing how an ancestor looked at the same age, can help you guess if a pup is similar or not. 

You're always watching puppies as you play with them anyhow. A pup that constantly catches your eye can be very special. You start to see how they stand naturally, if they trot naturally or not... often the first sign of well structured pups are those that will trot over running. So while I've been able to determine a few things - the boys all have their 'nuggets' (monorchids are a common problem in the breed), there are no fluffs, no mismarks and so far temperaments seem fantastic (not that i'm surprised coming from sweet parents), we can't yet see much in terms of structure.

We usually don't have surprises over all unless it's a very outcrossed breeding into lines we're not as familiar with. In that case we ask a lot of questions to the stud dog owner about his temperament and general disposition. The good news is that well bred corgis are not as sharp tempered as they were even from when we started in the breed in 1972. Knowing that the breed is now mostly a companion and less of a true working dog, it's important that temperaments work in both cases. We still want them to be able to work on a farm and many do (our co-breeder does herding trials with all her dogs), but 99% of the dogs are companions. Even our show dogs are our pets first and foremost. It's rare these days for a reputable hobby breeder to have a kennel building anymore. 

The important thing to remember with a corgi is that they are smart and stubborn and need both training and socialization. They are whet you put into them. Positive only training without boundaries rarely works on this breed. They need and respect that. Sometimes 'tough love' is needed. For example, when i'm doing nails there is a period where they don't like it and can fight it. I tell them to suck it up and deal with it. They learn that nothing bad is going to happen and that they have to accept that I'm going to dremel their nails. After that period they all line up and wait their turn every week.

437,"HAHA, there is a skull layered behind one of the others. Thankfully no siamese twins here. 

This is Sprout's first litter. Her dam had large puppies in her litters and bitches do tend to follow their dams in everything from heat cycles to puppy size. Mellow's pups are all perfectly normal sized adults, but they were just larger than the average (in our experience) at birth. Sprout was about 12 oz at birth and is now a 24 lb girl. Willow was only 6.5 oz at birth and is now 23~ lbs. We find birth weights don't completely correlate with their adult sizes. 

A dog can have a natural birth following a section assuming the reasons for the section wasn't something like uterine inertia (where the uterus does not properly contract). I've had dogs sectioned and they have gone on to have another litter naturally.

While we like to know that our dogs can whelp naturally, I will chose a section at the first sign of any complication. Keeping in mind that this is a surgery, and while it's rare, things can go wrong and there is a chance you can lose both your bitch and her litter. That said, you have a higher chance of having live pups via section than you do over a natural birth. 

If you know the ovulation date you are able to easily time an elective section. 63 days +/- 1 day is safe for puppies. As well, you can do a progesterone test to determine if they have dropped into the safe range if you're unsure about the ovulation date. Honestly there are times were I prefer a section. There is nothing worse that having to take a tired bitch who has been labouring for hours in to surgery when something goes wrong after neither of you have slept for 24+ hours. 

Post op care is relatively simple. We choose to use pain meds for mom where some don't. (Seriously, WTH?!

444,"hmmm, I'd say that this happens in any breed to a degree. For example dogs with tremendous reach and drive are often rewarded regardless of breed, regardless of whether or not that is correct for the breed. The same would hold true in PWCs and I expect in Cardis too. Both breeds are 'moderate' in movement according to the standard, yet we see dogs that are extreme being rewarded. A dog that is looser jointed or ligamented is going to have a more extreme gait, but if you look at this from a structural and longevity sense, these same dogs are going to be more prone to injury and thus have shorter 'careers' doing what they were bred to do. A dog with correct moderate movement has a much better chance of fewer injuries in the field. 

There is always a desire for flash when it comes to showing. A lot of novices (and sadly judges) only see flashy legs and assume it's correct despite the fact the dog is reaching 3 inches above the floor. The difference between an okay breeder or judge and a good one, is the ability to look beyond colour, markings, and fast movement... We need more of those.

447,"Line breeding allows you to concentrate on the virtues of similar dogs, you'll be able to typically see more consistency in a family when line breeding.

I have no issue with using frozen. We just had a litter via frozen from one of our deceased dogs. We had 6 pups and they're just 7 months old now!

The way people have chosen to breed has changed, even in the time I've been in the breed (okay, that IS my entire life, so it's not a short period). Individual breeders are keeping fewer boys - fewer dogs over all, but definitely fewer boys as they assume someone else will always have one for them to use. Bitches are generally easier to live with than intact boys, particularly when you have both and you have bitches cycling. This means that the quality in the boys has plummeted in the breed. Thankfully breeders seems to have recognized this and are starting to keep more males. I saw an improvement in the quality of the males at the National this year over previous years.

450,"yes, there is truth to that. And the answer is all of the above. Sometimes there are breedings of random dogs that just come together well and you get one nice offspring. Sadly those dogs seldom produce themselves as they still hold the genetics of their ancestors. When looking at potential mates, you need to look back a few generations. This is part of the reason line breeding is often desired. If you double up on a high quality dog with traits you wish to see, you have a higher chance of seeing those traits occur. Breeding to the dog itself really depends on his pedigree as well. Is it a strong sire that is the reason he's a quality dog, or is there a strong bitch line behind him too?

451,"All tests except for OFA Hips can be done at any time. CERF/OFA eye exams should be done about annually and I typically try to have at least 2 before a girl has a litter. OFA will only give a permanent number for Hips after 24 months, but they will give a preliminary number before that. The prelim is typically not published online. A potential buyer should ask to see all the test results. Checking the OFA database is great for hips, but many breeders choose not to pay to have the other testing published on their site. We choose to indicate test results for the public on our website, not all breeders do that and of course a not so ethical breeder could falsify information. 

Repro vets are now indicating that any time after 18 months old is healthy for a girl. *Ideally* waiting until you have an officially OFA number is best, but in some cases you may choose to breed earlier. For example, I have a young girl who is just coming 2 at the end of the year. She is cycling much faster than the norm (every 4-5 months) and with each cycle there is an increased rick for her to develop pyometra (a potentially fatal uterine infection). Considering this, I have chosen to do a preliminary evaluation on her hips and breed her earlier. She is due around the same time as Willow. 

The [Code of Ethics](http://pwcca.org/about-the-pwcca/code-of-ethics/) of the PWCCA says ""Not breed a bitch prior to 1 year of age or older than 8 years; not permit more than 6 litters in her lifetime; not breed a bitch more than 2 out of 3 consecutive seasons."" Most reputable breeders will wait until 2 and not breed much after 6 years old for a girl. Though, as indicated above, that can change depending on the situation of the individual. The guidelines are fairly vague, but if a puppy buyer was checking out articles like ""How to Identify a Reputable Breeder"" and other testing information when they contacted a breeder, they would quickly be able to determine if they were reputable or just a BYB.

About 50% of PWCs are AT RISK to develop DM. As mentioned, this is a late onset disease &amp; is painless. At this time we are missing a great deal of information on this disease. We only have ONE of the genes marked that MAY trigger the disease later in life. We have seen some family lines that are at risk, but never get it, and others that do. At this time we don't have enough information on the disease to effectively cut any and all at risk dogs from the gene pool without causing incredible harm to the overall health of the gene pool. Many breeders are testing, tracking, and waiting to see what further research may develop. Puppy producers that are waving DM clear or carrier certificates around like they're the ONLY thing that matter could cause the breed more damage than those who aren't testing at all. (it's been documented in more than one DM breed, that carriers could become affected later in life) A reputable breeder will look at the overall health and longevity of a pedigree and weigh many factors before choosing to breed their girl, or select a mate for her.

Revert your house training to what you'd do with a young puppy for a bit - take him outside lots and praise heavily for correct behaviours.

I live with a variety of dogs, the majority are intact. This means I have bitches in heat at various times and more than one intact male. Occasionally someone new, or a visitor will come into the house and mark - this is pretty normal behaviour and has caused more than one owner some embarrassment.

Neutering may help the behaviour a little, he's at the age where the boys start... well, let's just say that he's a teenager.

Typically estrus is about 3 weeks long, this does vary. A female will ovulate and be receptive to males around 10-14 days in a normal heat, and will be able to conceive for about a week (i'm really generalizing here). Please take care to not let her outside unsupervised, or go to any off leash areas during the duration of her heat cycle. It only takes a single breeding to conceive if at the right time, plus a first heat is far too immature for a baby to be having babies! The scent of a girl in heat can bring roaming boys from a long ways off.

I think in the years before social media we've just not been able to share these oddities as easily as we can now. Also it was always considering a bad thing for a breeder to produce a puppy that wasn't perfect. WAAAAAYYY back, it wasn't uncommon for puppies that were fluffs, or drastic mismarks to be culled at birth. Of course nothing like that has happened in recent years, but the taboo of breeding an oddity is still present and there is a fear you'll be snubbed for doing so. Thankfully minds are a lot more open now than they were even 20 years ago and we're seeing people come forward with information on interesting occurrences. 

These 'silver' pems are somewhat like a 'grey' Belgian Tervuren. The normal colour of a Terv is a rich mahogany - mostly red coat with black hairs interspersed, but on occasion a dog is born where there is a lack of intensity of red pigment (phaeomelanin) so they [appear grey](http://www.celticmoonobedience.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/IMG_16271.JPG) instead. If anyone wants further info on colour genetics, [here](http://www.doggenetics.co.uk/albino.html) is a great page that explains some of it as related to this puppy in particular as well as other ways that the red pigment can be affected.

While they do continue to mature physically after that, they have had a chance to mostly reach full size with their hormones in tact. Most dogs that are neutered early have increased risks for other issues (including cancers and other problems such as ACL tears if I recall correctly). 

As far as behavior goes, I wouldn't worry about any issues. My boys live in my house with my intact girls who cycle about every 5-7 months. They don't randomly mark on the floor or hump strangers. I DO have to watch the boys together when the girls are in heat, as hormones are raging and fights can break out. So, don't stop doing anything just because he's not neutered. Shape his behavior into what you want, manage your expectations and it won't matter if he's neutered or not for the most part. I walk with a pack of my puppy people at an off leash, it can include up to 4 intact males, 2 neutered, 3 intact girls, and 3 spayed girls.

Many breeders are now reaching out to dogs that are a great distance away and thus we're doing a lot of AI instead of breeding to what's nearby for convenience. So on top of stud fees (which really have remained fairly reasonable), we're paying for progesterone testing (at about $100 per, averaging 3-5 total), vet collection, extender media, fed ex over night (sometimes x2), insemination (which can vary from supply cost for at home, to $700+ for a surgical insemination). I'm assuming my next breeding will cost me well over $2000 BEFORE the girl is even bred. Not to mention costs of c-section if needed, post whelping vet care, puppy health checks, registration, microchipping etc etc. My last litter totaled 6k and I had 2 live puppies... so i'm really in the red on that one!

Instead of spaying strays they're breeding them to produce puppies for money, and so people can say they 'rescued' a dog and feel good about themselves.

604,"Being a reputable breeder myself, I am of course an advocate of buying a puppy from one. A reputable breeder will health test for the problems in the breed (in Pems that is OFA Hips, Eyes passed by a board certified ophthalmologist, DNA for vWD and DM). These tests are tools and DM is a difficult one as we are only testing for one aspect of the disease and cannot know what the triggers are for a potentially at risk dog to become affected. BUT, that said, using these tests are FAR better than just getting a wellness exam from your vet and going in blindly. A reputable breeder will belong to breed clubs for networking and learning opportunities, will research pedigrees, will search high and low for the best mate for their girl, will have a guarantee, and will do activities with their dogs - show, herding, obedience, rally, agility etc. If you go to meet local breeders at a dog show, just be aware that people can get very caught up in everything while they show. The best time to approach is after the judging is complete and they have time to spend with you. 

Of course this route isn't for everyone. Some people are will thing to take the risk of getting a healthy dog from untested parents for a lower cost up front. Some prefer to try rescue organizations for older dogs in need. You have to make that call and decide what works for you.... Good Luck! ",2015-07-02 20:27:44+00:00,csq9b8w,1,t3_3bujny,47918,corgi
605,"Most show breeders will go to great lengths to ensure their puppies are healthy and happy, but on occasion you are forced to weigh the pros and cons of euthanasia. I can tell you that the absolute WORST contact to have some one of our puppy people is news that the puppy you bred is sick somehow. We put so much time, effort, knowledge, and money into our puppies but we can't solve everything with the few tests we have available to us... sometimes shit happens and despite all you've done, a puppy gets sick. It's terrible and heartbreaking for everyone involved. I only hope it happens when the pup is with me so someone else doesn't have to experience the pain and worry. I'm so glad to hear this case was treatable and there is a happy ending. ",2015-07-02 19:24:56+00:00,csq6thl,5,t1_csq50cj,2690,corgi
606,"My general recommendation when choosing a name is that you have to be able to yell it, and that it is distinct sounding from other names and commonly used words. 2 syllables is great usually. 

My dogs are all registered (as per the law in Canada) and I often try to match their call name to their registered name. It doesn't always happen, but sometimes it's fun. We had [kennel name] Bottoms Up, called 'Cheers' for example. I currently have [kennel name] Highlander, called ""Heath"". His son [kennel name] Black Watch, called ""Duncan"". The girls we keep ourselves are named after flowers as our foundation dog was ""Flower"" and our lines all descend from her...  about 14 generations in total. My heart dog was ""Jo"" [kennel name] Everlasting - no real relation there, but her descendants have been roses &gt; [kennel name] Raindrops on Roses ""Rowan"" &gt; [kennel name] Damask Rose ""Scarlet &gt; [kennel name] La Vie En Rose ""Rosalie"" and [kennel name] Lady in Red ""Briar"". I'll have to find some fun varieties for the next generations too. ",2015-07-02 15:35:05+00:00,cspxu36,1,t3_3br5xn,91355,corgi

614,"8 weeks is a touch young to have gone to a new home. The reason many breeders wait another 2-4 weeks is partly to do with bite inhibition and socialization with their own kind. To deter biting, we typically use the loud 'ouch' method to start to simulate what a littermate might do. If a puppy is quite determined, sometimes you need to escalate that to a neck pinch. This is similar to what their dam or another older dog might do. Just a quick pinch on the back of the neck and provide a toy/treat for them to chew instead of you to push them in a positive direction. It's going to take time!

At this age it is mostly just letting them be a puppy, but that said, when it comes to training a corgi of either breed sometimes 'tough love' is the way to go. I start leash training my guys with super yummy treats (freeze dried liver is great), tonnes of praise when they come along with me, but I also let them fight it out if they're going to be a fish at the end of the leash. As soon as they take a step or two towards me, I go over the top with praise. They soon figure out that if they fight it it doesn't go well, if they come with me it does.
