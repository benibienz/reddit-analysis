Right now what happens is the NCAA officials and school officials and coaches pocket the big money and the non-profit sports that give scholarships provide students benefit for all the cash the basketball and football players bring in.  And the the basketball and football players get extremely fancy living and facilities at most big schools.

But I certainly agree that paying the players by re-routing money from the coaches , assistant coaches and administrators would make sense.  But it is a very small number of players that will really benefit - some basketball and football players at big schools and maybe a few others here and there (depending on the school).

Where for physical devices they are have the product and the only option is a recall which is very expensive and often ignored.

Software testing however should pay attention to those points in the 2 links above.  What you want is not just to fix the bugs software testers catch but figure out the reasons those bugs were created and improve you process so you create fewer bugs in the future.

No matter what the software quality is based on the code that is written.  At the best software testing can tell people about the bugs but unless the code is fixed the software quality didn't change.

30,"&gt; Corruption and cronyism are a part of the capitalist system.

Corruption and cronyism are likely part of the human condition at least in large populations.  So yes, I don't expect them to be eliminated in any form of economic system.  However I do see a big difference is seeing those weaknesses as the issue to address versus trying to find some alternative to capitalism.

Humans will commit murder and many other crimes in whatever economic system you have.  If you say the crimes are due to the economic system that seems to me to miss the point (even while I see that the type of economic system and the way it is executed could well set the conditions to increase or decrease the instance of crimes).  Looking around the world and through history corruption and cronyism seem pretty common in every form of economy we have tried.

I do believe we should try to reduce corruption and cryonysim.  And I believe the concepts Adam Smith proposed make more sense than any other economic system that I know of.  I think ""Capitalism just determines how we divvy up the loot."" is very misleading.  Look at China for example, they have adopted some capitalist principles (even if they have far from done so completely).  To say that the change in China's standard of living for average people is not due to changes in the economic system (which to me seems most obviously to be adopting capitalist principles) is a difficult claim to justify.  The resources and people they had were the same before and since the economic gains they have made.

And yes, China is far from perfect.  They have tons of corruption and cronyism now.  They had tons 40 years ago.  But it seems to me China has benefited greatly from adopting capitalist principles.  They have a long way to go to improve their execution in China.

Another example is Singapore.  They started out having a socialist view.  They changed to a much more capitalist view and their economic growth has been great.  Again, their capitalist system has odd quirks.  It seems reasonable to look at Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia over the last 60 years and they started off from pretty similar places.  Singapore didn't start with different technology, labor or natural resources (in most ways the other two have vastly better natural resources).  If you had to look at one difference in what created the huge benefits to Singapore I believe saying capitalism is as right as anything you can credit it to.  Singapore also has lower levels of corruption and cronyism than most countries but it does have them (the PM is the long term PMs son, for example).

None of this is completely straight forward.  Most (well all basically, except the USA) rich countries have a single payer health care system.  I believe the data shows that is by far the best system.  I also believe it is the moral choice for society to provide basic health care.  But it isn't due to some capitalist principle that this should be done.  I do believe capitalism provides society the most benefit of any economic system we have tried, by a very large margin.  I don't believe that means we need to use capitalism to decide everything.

Capitalist principles also believe in letting those that create economic benefit be rewarded.  There is plenty of room to argue capitalist principles do not support rewarding the children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, great-great-grandchildren... for the economic benefit their long dead relatives created.  I strongly believe rewarding trust fund babies is a huge mistake.  I believe taxing negative externalities (pollution etc.) and inherited wealth are the 2 most capitalist taxes that exist http://investing.curiouscatblog.net/2006/10/15/estate-tax-repeal/  Though, I do understand, you don't often hear this claim made.",2016-04-28 11:08:28+00:00,d2kjex3,4,t1_d2k9p12,27097,Economics

--------
""They're not rejecting the concept,"" Della Volpe said. ""The way in which capitalism is practiced today, in the minds of young people — that's what they're rejecting.""

This is what is so dangerous in my opinion.  We have allowed those practicing corruption and cronyism to claim what they are doing is capitalism while ignoring basic tenets of capitalism such as, competitive markets.

We need to be less cronyist and more capitalist
 http://investing.curiouscatblog.net/2011/12/05/we-need-to-be-more-capitalist-and-less-cronyist/

If it didn't matter if turned away from capitalism it wouldn't matter that we are allow those seeking to justify their policies by claiming they are capitalist.  But what we have allowed to happen is many people to believe capitalism is what is the problem which means they seek solutions that are not-capitalism.  Society would be much better off if instead we sought capitalism and fought those creating non-capitalist policies while saying those policies were capitalism.

Capitalism creates huge benefits for society.  Losing those benefits because we allow the kind of things Adam Smith clearly saw as risk that much be managed (such as collusion by businesses to disrupt the market and gain monopolistic pricing power etc.) is sad.

If your preference is to increase your odds of having a successful digital nomad experience then take longer.  Do 3 things:

  1) Get experience earning money in a location independent way (you can do that where you live more easily than anywhere else).

  2) Save up some money.  This item most people will skip but it is helpful.

  3) Travel to where you would like to be a nomad for a trial run.  If you want to do it in SE Asia take some time visiting and seeing what it is like.

There seems to be a failure at the policy level as to the timing.  They seem to have created the rules to make your eligibility for the month after you move back (which seems silly).  In this case there will definitely be a period where you are uncovered which is just a very bad idea and very bad policy. They also have it based on a specific physical address, again bad design but they don't seem to really care about practical realities - like you might not have a permanent address in advance.  But they don't seem very concerned with the details of making it actually work for people.

I would suggest applying and take your move into the country as a special event that makes you eligible to enroll outside of ""open season"" because that is what the rules seem to allow.

56,"I disagree, it seems to me the top 2 seeds that experts pick against often fail early.  I don't have the data to back it up but that is my memory.

Picking which 1 and 2 seeds fail early is much easier than picking those that do well (they have to win at least 4 games - granted really 3 games since the 1st should be a cakewalk).  Picking which team beats them is hard, saying they just have several tough games and will likely miss on one of them isn't as hard.

Some years you have teams like Kentucky last year that picking them to make the final four isn't so hard.  But that isn't very common.  Michigan State and Kansas look really good, but they can certainly get beat before the final four.  I think Michigan State has the most going for it but especially Virginia is a great team and there are several others that could stop Michigan State.

Kansas has a bunch of teams that could play great games and keep them out: Maryland, Miami, Villanova, even Iowa and Arizona and maybe Uconn.  But especially Maryland and Iowa can also play like junk and lose early.  And Kansas only has to play 1 of Miami, Villanova, Iowa or Arizona so I think their route is easier (and I think they are stronger than UNC anyway).

I think Carolina is good but they have a bunch of really good teams they might have to beat and making the final four will likely be tough.  They might be the most likely team to destroy some teams (after the 1st round where several will).  But they also may well get taken out by Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia or Xavier or even Wisconsin.  If they miss Kentucky that will be lucky, Indiana can play great but also should be easier to beat (but in 1 game Indiana can easily win).",2016-03-15 18:34:50+00:00,d10ww41,3,t1_d10pqyg,9731,CollegeBasketball

Part of your logic makes sense, pro scoring leaders are very good and college leaders are often not even going to be in the NBA. But following that logic, I believe to find if it happened you would likely look at the pros that lead, and then their colleges.  I figure it is more likely a couple hot games at places where they played Kansas (Wilt Chamberlin...), UNC (Jordan) or UCLA... would be where it happened if any school was every to be as awesome as Davidson by this measure.

The much harder part is to have the person from your school leading the NBA.  That is going to be the main constraint.  It is true there are tons of schools that had the leading scoring early in the NCAA season (I bet) but most of them have 0 players even in the NBA forget leading it in scoring.  While most schools producing the NBA scoring will have players that might lead early in the season (even though as you say often they will be edged out by either super high scoring teams with a very high scoring player or just someone that scored 40+% of the team points.

Leading at the end of the season is even harder.  But also going back in history it is more likely really great players on great teams in the NCAAs lead the nation (I think).  Now it is very rare, it is usually some tiny school.

It didn't actually cover everybody (ethnic minorities could have more, rural households that had a girl first could have another child) even at the beginning.  Even before the latest change (to allow 2 children for everyone) if both parents were single children they could have 2.  And enforcement in rural areas was far from perfect, there were far more kids that 1 child per couple would indicate.

Even if it was really 1 child per couple, demographics take a LONG time to adjust to changes.

The second biggest piece is about creating huge barriers to the sovereignty of countries (to benefit corporations giving large amounts of cash).  The TPP is designed to paying those giving politicians cash so that they can ignore the laws of the countries they operate in or have those laws invalidated by the elimination of the rights of countries to have sovereignty over their laws.

The TPP is an absolute travesty of corruption.

114,"Few laws say what is legal they normally say what is not.  I would imagine few countries specifically say it is legal to do work from another country (as a digital nomad, as a employee answering an email on your vacation, as a private investor reading the news and making using the internet to buy or sell a stock using your broker from home, as a writer writing your book that will be published back home or whatever).

The laws usually are pretty clear you can't apply for jobs and get hired by a company inside that country to do work in that country on a tourist visa.

""Thailand"" has said it is ok to work as a digital nomad (work for some company outside the country) while on a tourist visa.  But these pronouncements by officials don't carry much weight with other officials so they are not worth much.

What is helpful is knowing the prohibitions against working are primarily about not having foreigners take jobs of the citizens.  Digital nomads don't do that.  So they are not meant to be prohibited anymore than the other examples (an executive participating in a conference call from work while on vacation etc.).  

But since it isn't clear cut it can be confused by officials as something not allowed.  It is much easier not to have to get low level officials to comprehend the intent of the laws.  They think of it as tourists can't work in the country and that is essentially true.  But how ""work"" is defined is the issue and pretty much digital nomad work doesn't fit the description of work in that context.

To stay in that context you certainly shouldn't do any work in the country (don't create a web site for a business in the country etc.).  If you do that type of thing you pretty likely need a business visa.

Another factor of enforcement is not really related to the intent of working in the country laws but emphasis put on the bureaucracy on stopping certain people from staying too long.  If the country is tired of acting out by long term backpackers (for example) they then try to find reasons to kick people out or not let them in.

Part of this is driven by the idea these people likely have hidden jobs - or how could they stay so long.  Rather than find every time one of these people breaks the rules and kick them out, just kick people out that might have illegal jobs.  Another is if they just don't like how backpackers have overtaken certain areas and they start kicking people out.

I suppose countries could get tired of people staying at the 4 seasons too long but that doesn't seem to happen.  Partially because people probably don't do that too much.  And also those people are bringing in so much foreign currency that most countries would like that so much they don't care about whatever else is going on as long as it isn't too illegal or destructive.

Most mid or low income countries are in desperate need of foreign cash right now.  Go look at charts of their currency versus the USA $ to get an idea.  If it is collapsing vs the $ they likely desperately want foreign $ that digital nomad and any tourists... bring.  

Their central banks and heads of government know this need of foreign currency right now.  And it is bad enough that most countries that have decently well functioning government have made the heads of border patrol organizations aware of this.  But getting that message down to the border guards is very difficult in most places.

I am confident that those at the top of most countries with lots of digital nomads love them and would love to attract many more.  But how they can implement that desire in the current bureaucracy is not so easy.

In addition in countries with a lot of corruption larger businesses (even just 1 factory) concentrate enough cash that there is plenty to pay out to corrupt individual to avoid bureaucratic annoyances.  In general, digital nomads don't fit well into the you should be paying us or we should be making your life difficult mindset.

Another issue is countries with the most competent governments generally are so rich that digital nomads bring in not nearly enough cash to matter at all and usually add to already overcrowded places (Singapore is a good example).

My guess is a few countries are going to figure out how to roll out the welcome mat for digital nomads and help their economies (not hugely but you have realize bringing in foreign currency has benefits that far surpass the absolute $ involved).  And with a large digital nomad presence there a significant benefits to owners and workers in very much the same way as found with tourism.

Countries spend large amounts trying to attract tourists.  Digital nomad numbers used to be tiny.  Digital nomad numbers are still small compared to tourism.  But they have actually reached a point of making a difference (helped by the long term nature of nomad stays).  Thailand has a good shot at being one of the countries that may to this, Chile and Honduras maybe others.  If Malaysia was smart they would be - they may be the most desperate for $ right now due to heavy debt load (and lots of it held by foreigners - though some of that has been dumped are foreigners flee) and reliance on natural resources which have been clobbered.",2015-08-27 16:06:56+00:00,cuhkpd7,3,t1_cuhfwwc,7648,digitalnomad

Koenig and Hayes give the Badgers a huge foundation to build from.  Koenig is especially important as Wisconsin is so dependent on the point guard position (most college teams are and Wisconsin even more so).

128,The idea is just to get yourself back on track by doing something that is familiar so that you are up to going out and exploring.  This is also one of the nice things about slow travel versus a short vacation - on a short vacation you are burning up precious time with anything other than exploring a new place.  When you are slow traveling you don't have to be totally focused only on making the most out of every precious minute - if you want to indulge yourself or need to get your strength back you have time to do so.,2015-07-14 16:47:12+00:00,ct331u9,3,t1_ct2zjso,5019,solotravel
129,"I never felt that way but you do really learn about yourself when you travel alone.  Being independent, willing to make your own decisions and accept the consequences within a community where you have built in support is one thing.  Doing that when you are flying solo is fairly different (in my experience).

I had a couple times where feeling I was all on my own and finding that a bit difficult but most of the time it was great.  The initial shock does get a fair number of people but usually they recover pretty quickly.

My main advice is to do what you can just to make yourself feel better for a bit now (calling home, eating ice cream, watching the 5th Element, go drinking with people from the hostel, go get some great food - Cooking Love is really nice... whatever things work for you).  Just get some comfort and allow yourself to re-stabilize a bit.  I think most of the time that is all it takes to get over the initial shock some people feel.  Of course, for some people, something different might do the trick...",2015-07-14 16:44:02+00:00,ct32x28,3,t1_ct2snaf,19208,solotravel
130,"Well said.  The introvert term is often used in a much broader and more derogatory way than is useful.  

Introverts needn't be incapable of being social and smooth and gregarious.  A useful way to use the term is that introverts are drained interacting with others all day and extroverts are drained being by themselves all day.

Another useful way to look at it is introverts think to themselves first while extroverts like to ""think out-loud""...

Loneliness doesn't seem very correlated to how people self-identify as introvert or extrovert.  Loneliness isn't the same thing as being drained by interacting with people all day.

Extroverts may well feel anxious with much less alone-time than it would take for an introvert to feel anxious.  I think we often have vague understanding of terms that we then conflate and in communication with others muddy the waters.

There are people that say they are introverts when really they are a bit shy and wish they were less social awkward (even when they are not very awkward compared to others).  But those people crave being around others to drawn energy from that and are uncomfortable being alone and are not really introverts at all, but int he vague way the term is used it often means something like this.

There are introverts that have high thresholds for feeling lonely and those with very low thresholds and many in between.  We also tend to equate being too independent from others as a weakness - anti-social etc. (while I tend to think of anti-social as people that lash out at others, not just people that want to be left alone more often than others think is good).

There is a reasonable amount of scientific evidence that social isolation is damaging to health so there is a basis for the general consensus that those who are in too few social relationships are unhealthy.  But people are pretty varied, the point at which limited social interaction being unhealthy medically it seems to me is much less restrictive than the social conventions.

We are social creatures, social bonds are important, but I think we are too quick to apply general rules of thumb to specific situations (and in so doing are not very accurate).  What makes some people lonely would make other people feel smothered with having to deal with too much social interaction.

I traveled a lot and wasn't lonely at all.  And am an introvert (though not a very strong one) - my level of introversion is close to normal.  I think my tolerance for not feeling lonely is fairly extreme.

The question from OP and a fair number of similar ones I see seem to be people that are prone to feeling lonely while they also are not comfortable meeting people all the time and even more feeling close to people you just met.  I do think that combination isn't a great match for nomadic living.  But other advantages of nomadic living may still make it worthwhile.  And then the question become how to work on meeting people and maybe how to work on how to not feel lonely as much.  

Feelings of loneliness are not solved by forcing yourself into social situations (I don't think).  But those usually are solved with long term, close friends that you are extremely comfortable with.  For most people that is much easier to achieve when you are geographically near them - so nomadic living is often more difficult.  

There are feeling of loneliness (or something similar) that does seem to be solved with just being around others even in a very superficial way.  I am not sure if that is classified as something other than loneliness but I suspect it is (by people that actually know about this stuff).  But in any event that can be solved pretty easily on the nomadic life (doing what many other say here and on similar posts) - even if you are fairly shy and uncomfortable meeting strangers.  If you are very shy then it isn't quite as easy but is doable, it is just more stressful for you.",2015-07-12 15:38:50+00:00,ct0q3ql,3,t1_ct0n5t4,7129,digitalnomad
131,"I am sure most all the countries with cheap costs of living love the foreign currency digital nomads bring.  Sure the more those nomads spend the better - so most shoestring nomads don't bring a lot of benefit to the countries but those that spend even $1,000 a month in places like Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines  are very valuable resources those countries would love to attract more of.

For those countries getting in foreign currency is hugely important, especially as fears rise given the whole Greek drama and other economic worries are increasing.  Other than creating good jobs in their country bringing in foreign currency is about the most important thing for any of these low income countries.

The digital nomads benefits from a cheap standard of living but the countries benefit more (of course what the heck does ""more"" mean here - it is just my opinion on the relative value).",2015-07-07 10:58:19+00:00,csuudwb,5,t1_csuropx,11326,digitalnomad

134,"Yes, it doesn't amount to much capacity at all.  The problem is 5 years in the making, they needed a large amount of new capacity online by 2013 at least.  The 3rd link should have been working by then.

And if the MRT extension continues to be treated without urgency the problems are just going to get worse and worse (unless Singapore just gives up committing large amounts to Johor and invests in economic ties elsewhere instead).

They need to be building the 3rd link now and moving forward the MRT as quickly as possible.  Even doing that the problems are likely to increase greatly until the MRT is running with at least 3 (hopefully 5) stations in JB.

Everything else is tiny little adjustments that don't amount to much.  I mean sure boats and trains can help a tiny bit so do it, but it isn't a serious effort to deal with the long term problem.

I am sure it is costing Johor a large amount of investment.  I sure wouldn't be happy if I was LegoLand or JPO and I see huge numbers of my potential customers just give up because commuting is such a nightmare.

And if I am some big bank or other company in Singapore I wouldn't build (or sign a lease so someone else will build it based on me as an anchor tenant) an office tower until Johor has decent transportation in place.  Better transportation links will help Singapore but it is a very minor issue for Singapore's economy, it is by far the most important for Johor's economy and has been for at least 5 and probably 10 years yet very little evidence can be pointed to that it is being treated as such.

Now gambling investors can make investments in Johor on the theory that the transportation won't stay mired in such slow progress forever.  And once people the 3rd link and MRT are delivered they will likely do very well - but the lack of urgency would be a huge warning sign for conservative investors to wait until Johor proves that care about addressing the most important economic issue, until then I would have to say the smart money should wait.  4 years ago I was more willing to say investing was wise, because smart things were being done and it seemed reasonable they wouldn't mess up transportation but that guess looks much less certain now.",2015-07-05 16:22:04+00:00,csswv8p,2,t1_cssudjp,5864,johor_bahru_malaysia

Uber promises some sort of insurance backstop to drivers.  This whole area seems in need of much improvement in my opinion, but regardless of that, it is another example of Uber's relationship with drivers.
