via phone participants will discuss Deming's last book, The New Economics. The Aerojet-Rocketdyne course visits another area along “An InThinking Roadmap” and is open to anyone, Aerojet-Rocketdyne employee or not.  You may ""register"" either by sending me a note at timothy.higgins@rocket.com or using the URL https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/InThinkingTogetherRegistration.  

Please register before 27APR2016 stating your intention to participate in a portion of the seven sessions or in the entire series.  Repeat participants and first timers are equally welcome.
Aerojet-Rocketdyne will arrange a free call-in number for non-employees in the USA. [Callers from abroad can connect via phone at their expense.]

About the book 

The book is The New Economics for Government, Industry, Education  2nd Edition by W. Edwards Deming ISBN: 9780262541169. Available in Kindle format. Please obtain your book and for the first session read the introductory text and the first two chapters.

From the back cover of the Fourth printing of the 2nd Edition of The New Economics
This book is for people in industry, government and education who are living under the tyranny of the prevailing style of management.

About the series

We will read two chapters (or so) before each of six sessions then connect to share ideas about what we have read.  We will conduct a seventh session relating what we may have learned to current events at work, at home, or in the news. 
Not all participants are able to join all seven sessions.  Participating more is better, but there is no attendance contest.  Join us:
