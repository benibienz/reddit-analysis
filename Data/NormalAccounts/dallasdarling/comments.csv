8,"&gt; 2 - Also, I heard a lot of christians say that you can't trust science, because the government controls science. If they wanna say that sugar is good to sell more sugar they will! And they showed me books and articles that argue against evolution, Big Bang, Relativity, Old Earth etc.... How do I know if it is true or not???

I'll take on this one.

The government does have some influence on what scientific studies get funded and therefore are able to go forward, so it would be dishonest to claim that there is no influence. However, the intellectual and scientific community exists separately from the control of any government, because it's an international, peer-reviewing, self-testing community in pursuit of truth.

That said, whereas the US government does provide some funding for research of many different kinds, major corporations are now actively hiring scientists to design studies and produce results that favour their legistlative objectives. So there is some outside influence on the process.

Your best bet is look for reputable sources, and seek out what the community consensus seems to be, and try to remain open-minded to the possibility that we will know more and understand it all better, in the future.

9,"The problem with labelling something mental illness, from a clinical standpoint, is that you need to meet certain impairment criteria. Someone may hold a delusion, or experience hallucinations, or by inordinately obsessive about certain kinds of control for security, or struggle with purging unneeded belongings, but it doesn't rise to the level of a mental illness until the condition has persisted for a certain period of time, and has measurably impaired the patient's function in home, work, family life, etc, and/or has caused marked distress which is itself interfering with functioning.

If those criteria are not met, the condition would be considered subclinical. Religiosity may well be a form of subclinical psychiatric disorder, but that doesn't exactly warrant writing off all religion as mental illness.

32,"I strongly disagree with the proposition to completely eliminate sex offender registries. This is an essential tool for communities and law enforcement to ensure that past offenders are able to live and work in society with as little risk as possible to others.

That said, the registries are not currently being used in the most effective manner. For example - minors should not be subject to sex offender registries, imo. And obviously public urination is not a sexual crime, though indecent exposure is, and a pattern of such behavior can be indicative of potential escalation in the future. I think the registry should be used judiciously, and those on it should, under some circumstances, be able to appeal to a review board to have their names removed. 

However, to suggest that the registry system serves no purpose other than to perpetuate a false ""sex offender panic"" is a gross mischaraterization. If someone commits a violent sexual offence, or offends against a child, that person is statistically more likely to engage in similar behaviour in the future, and in order for us to protect ourselves, public registries are essential. Sexual violence is a reality for 1 in 6 men and 1 in 5 women. To pretend that laws and structures like these are part of a puritanical over-reaction to sexuality and not a response to the reality of sexual violence is to erase all victims and preference perpetrator's privacy over the rights of others to be safe from predation.

Another issue that is frequently overlooked by proponents of banning sex offender registries, but which makes me particularly surprised to see this post in a radical feminist sub, is the reality of the sex disparity in sexual crimes. The vast majority of sexually motivated crimes are committed by adult men, against women and children. This has been the case for millenia. Whether the cause is biological or the phenomenon is merely a biproduct of indoctrination into the male-supremacist world view of patriarchy, or the more likely combination of these, is an open question still. But as a woman, a mother, and a radical feminist, I could not condone the elimination of this tool to prevent the further abuse of already-disenfranchized women and children by actors in an oppressive power-structure of male supremacy and patriarchy.

A baby changes everything.


So if you like your life without children, you can be reasonably sure that you will continue to like your child-less life, and go on to a happy and comfortable old age.

If you want your entire life to change - your priorities, your free-time, the coffee-table you choose for your living room, the way everything in your home smells, what time you have to be home each evening, how far in advance you have to plan for travel near and far, what you spend your money on, when you get to have sex, and where - having a baby will do that.

There are pros and cons to either option, but you can't really predict in advance how the procreation will go. You can screen for birth defects and abort if necessary. But you can't undo it, once you go down that road.

183,"The way women avoided becoming single mothers was abortion and adoption, often against their true wishes. Why is it bad to foster a state that wants children to be born and raised by mothers who want them? Why is it a bad thing to subsidize the next generation of tax payers by providing for at least some tiny portion of their needs? Those subsidies in no way pay for anywhere near the actual cost of those children, much less the costs of housing and transportation and childcare needed for mothers to work so that they are not dependent on the system. If it were possible to profit from welfare, or even break even, that would be different. But in practice, it's not. It's just a little bit of help that keeps infants from starving or missing out on necessary medical care.

The problem with applying a macroeconomic argument here is that it presumes that not subsidizing single-motherhood would result in fewer single mothers *and also* fewer children dependent on the state. That won't happen. We'll just end up with more infants in the already-underfunded foster care system. Or more abortions. People will still get pregnant - especially considering that 50% of pregnancies in the US are unintended. Those unintended pregnancies will still happen. Addressing the pregnancy prevention crisis in the US with comprehensive sex education and subsidized long-term birth control and abortion services would solve a lot of this, but that would require the political will to empower women to make active reproductive choices, rather than hem them into a limited set of reactive options.

It's also really counter-intuitive to hear that women should be discouraged from having children on their own and receiving support from the government BUT that mandatory child support from their male partners is also somehow wrong to require or enforce. Typically those stances go together, and they make little sense in tandem. Basically the argument is then, that the only people who should be supported in having children are married heterosexual couples, and everyone else should be punished. Because those pregnancies will still happen, whether we support them or not. We just don't quietly shuffle single pregnant women off to work-houses and force them to adopt out their children to neglectful orphanages anymore. I think this is a good thing, not a bad thing.

Single-motherhood has been on the rise in the last century in part because divorce is accessible, but primarily because it's less stigmatized now, especially in the last couple of decades, meaning most of those unintended, out-of-wedlock pregnancies that in earlier generations would have ended in quiet, illegal abortions, or been turned over to an orphanage system, are now being born and raised by their biological mothers. 

Whether or not women opt for single-motherhood thinking that the welfare system will pay for the child and for them, it doesn't. The existence of support might be a contributing factor to the motivation to have more children that you can support, but in practice it doesn't actually fill in those gaps.",2016-10-07 14:36:33+00:00,d8hwhha,6.0,t1_d8hw3bm,554.0,confession

They just don't get it. They don't get that you can't just  pull the rug over it and pretend like nothing happened, and also that it's up to ME to decide when (and IF) I ever acknowledge his presence ever again. For the record, it's unlikely. But I'm trying to come to a place of forgiveness. I'm not there yet. I went through denial. Then paralyzing fear. Now I'm really, really furious. But trying to guilt me into staying for family christmas, with him there, is just so manipulative, and is never going to help me forgive or move on, its only going to make it worse.

238,"Honestly I think you're setting this kid up for a difficult life, no matter what you choose to do. Either he/she grows up with a different dad than his/her siblings, and with a dad who is only a secondary partner to your husband. Or he/she eventually discovers (either because you tell them or they figure it out) that their dad isn't their real dad. Either way it's going to be hard.

One reason I still think it's better to withhold the paternity information is that you need to think about the child in the context of the social world in which they will grow up, and their psychological well-being. If you tell them who their real father is but then require them to keep it secret, you are burdening the child. Keeping family secrets can be very destructive to a child's psyche. On the other hand, if you decide to be open about the nature of your relationship, the child is likely to be ostracized by other children and their parents because of your unconventional relationship structure. That might not be fair, but it's true.

Choosing to keep the child and choosing to let your bf raise it with you will expose the true nature of your relationship in the long run, so you might as well come out to your family. If they support you, it will be easier.

245,"Overcoming aversion to physical contact was a real challenge for me. I found that it was easiest for me to start touching other people first. Being touched/hugged by someone else was very uncomfortable.

You could start by just hold hands. Leaning on his/her shoulder while watching a movie. Allowing him/her to put their head on your lap or vice-versa might be a but much to start with but it depends. 

The more you can find opportunities to actively touch your friend, even for short periods, the more comfortable it will become.

I also want to recommend an affectionate pet or child for practice. A sweet purring kitty or a friendly niece or nephew who wants to sit with you and read a book can be a wonderful way to work on desensitization. For me, it took actually having a child, and breastfeeding. That made a world of difference in terms of grounding me to reality, building distress tolerance, and learning to love and thrive on physical intimacy as a way to bond and relax. However, for many people, a kid actually makes things worse, so it really depends. 

If you can also identify some dos and donts for your friend (ie - do touch my arm when you want my attention, but don't hug me from the front or walk up from behind me and touch me, etc) that will be helpful. Quite apart from my own issues, my beloved partner had a hard time when we first got together because his ex-wife would routinely punch him as a ""joke"" out of the blue, and other than that barely ever made any kind of contact. After a couple of years of that, it was both difficult and, he has said, very welcome and healing, to become accustomed to being with me. My child and I are very affectionate, and will randomly hug each other and him all the time. But there are certain ways and places that he has asked me not to touch him because it's triggering. It helps me to know. For example - I can come up from behind him and hug him (I do this A LOT) but I need to touch his shoulders or back before reaching around to hug him. If I go straight for his stomach, he jumps and gets all tense, and then feels embarrassed and angry, and I don't want any of that. So guidelines are helpful.

And I stand by that. Sure, Mars missions have value, and we will learn a lot and hopefully gain access to resources we can use for self-replicating spacecraft that can easily launch from the lower gravity conditions and continue to move out into other parts of the solar system or further.

But colonization - not manned missions but an actual self-sustaining colony of more than scientists - families, children, domestic animals, schools, local commerce, all the things that make it a true colony and not just a operational base - won't be feasible on Mars.

This whole perspective of ""getting to"" donate is backwards. The rights, feelings, and preferences of the donor are not at issue. The health and safety of the recipient are the priority.

Regardless, no one is making claims about immunity, merely statistical likelihood. The fact remains that HIV infection rates not only are higher among MSM, but the rates of infection are actually rising alarmingly fast among young MSM. 

Arguments along the lines of ""well, X group also has really high infection rates"" only supports the case that there should be MORE restriction and MORE screening in place to prevent other high-risk groups from donating.

Bottom line: it's not about the donors, at all. It's about patient health. We can't administer a blood transfusion to a patient without taking every possible measure to ensure that blood is not infected.

No amount of name-calling will erase the very real justifications for these and other precautions (like preventing people who have lived in certain countries, travelled to certain places recently, do or have any point used intravenous drugs, are taking certain medications, are carriers of certain blood disorders, or have a history of certain cancers, etc).",2016-09-29 14:48:24+00:00,d86xwxj,,t1_d83ke31,,gay

When I'm manic, it's all I can think about. All the time. It gets in the way of work, parenting, my relationship, everything. It's really frustrating and I get so desperate that the idea of killing my sex drive entirely is actually a relief. The mere thought of having an impulse and needing to resist it is gives me anxiety and makes me even more horny in rebellion. So I'm better off making myself anorgasmic.

I don't think its really possible to actually kill my libido. That's never happened for me. I can still enjoy sex and intimacy with my partner, and I still want it even if I'm not horny or not horny enough to actually get off (I never got off from sex, only masturbation or oral, and not that often when I'm balanced) so it's not a big cost in my relationship.

But after yesterday, where an entire day of being hyperfocused on sex, sexual violence, my sexuality, reading about paraphilias and treatment options, child abuse and child sexual development, and on and on, I was so out of control that I was masturbating in the car on the drive home, and stopped to pick up fetish stuff, and basically from then on was in an acting out cycle and couldn't think clearly again and recognize my obsessive fixation until I had finally gotten off, and then gotten high.

And that moment of clarity, where I realized - omg I'm really not well and this has sucked up my entire day today - it only lasted a few minutes. I acted out twice more last night.

I'm going to try to focus on other things today but it's already been hard - I mean, I'm here talking about it already. So I'm going to try to stay off reddit and off the news and just focus on work today, somehow.

Thanks for you advice and support, though, I appreciate it. I agree with you that hypersexuality is one of the most difficult symptoms for me - it's such a powerful drive. It's hard to think clearly, and it's debilitating to my judgement, and it comes with powerful negative feelings once I get past the urges and start to feel normal again.

* Celexa -- not sure how well it worked, didn't take it regularly enough

* Wellbutrin -- did not help with smoking cessation or overeating for me, but did increase metabolism and help some with mood. takes a while to kick in, tends to work better for men. 

* Lamictal -- made my stomach upset

* Depakote -- made me groggy and fear of weightgain kept me from taking it regularly, so no idea if it works well or not

* Latuda -- worked ok to reduce compulsions but when I took it I was also on cocaine so...... it might have worked much better if I'd been sober.

* Seroquel -- still have some for emergencies, I only take it when mania is out of control and I haven't been sleeping. Makes me hung-over - I'm barely awake enough to keep my eyes open during the day.

* Carisoprodol -- for muscle pain from anxiety, and for sleep. Worked quite well. 

* Concerta -- great for ADHD, just too expensive for me right now",2016-07-07 16:56:37+00:00,d530paa,1.0,t3_4rk5w1,78771.0,bipolar
342,"If you are just being honest about your beliefs, and not being obnoxious or denigrating others' beliefs, then there is not reason for those relationships to dissolve just because your core beliefs differ. So if someone walks away because of a difference of belief, that's their issue, not yours. I mean, it's not like, when you were a christian, you actually believed all of the same things they did. Beliefs are wildly different between practitioners on many different kinds of issues, both social and theological. They might not have noticed the differences, but I'd be shocked if there were none. 

It's hard to step away though. I will say that you might find additional support over at r/exmormon because in smaller religious sects, departure from the faith often comes with a loss of friends and family.  ",2016-07-07 16:45:44+00:00,d53065n,1.0,t3_4rno69,26438.0,atheism

But ""power"" and ""supernatural healing"" are not among the things most mainstream protestant churches promise you. I mean, why would they?

461,"The problem with the ""natural law"" claims are that, of course, sexuality serves many, many different functions for humans, not just procreation. The idea that a thing has only one purpose, or only a primary purpose, is overly simplified. Even we concede that things have a purpose, and that sex has a primary purpose, it would be hard to argue that the primary purpose of sex is procreation, since humans (unlike other animals) have sex throughout the month and throughout pregnancy, and well past child-bearing age. If sex were intended for procreation primarily, we would only want sex and only be able to physically have sex during periods of ovulation, like most other mammals.  The vast majority of sexual intercourse that a married, monogamous couple will have will not result in offspring. On average, only 2-4 of those times will result in pregnancy. Literally every other time, we're talking thousands and thousands of episodes of intense, church-sanctioned, sexual intimacy, are not for the purpose of making babies, and won't result in a baby even if they wanted it to. Indeed, even female sex organs require something other than penetrative sex in order to lead to orgasm, for most women.

What could sex be for, then, if not procreation? Bonding, stress relief, and even a boost to the immune system, are all consistent products of sex within a partnership. Of these, I think pair bonding is the most comprehensive - this is the consistent neurological, hormonal, social, and psychological result of sex within a partnership. Sex has the potential to serve this function every single time (unlike the procreative function, which can only potentially be filled under specific circumstances, and is rare in a person's full life-span). And, unsurprisingly, not just church-approved PIV sex achieves this end. Oral sex. Anal sex. Sex with your same-sex spouse. All achieve this end.

512,"Sex is real. Gender is simply a social construct, and is enacted upon a person by the culture in which they live.

I think the issue is one of vocabulary, here. You can't be born with a gender, if we are operating with the feminist definition of ""gender."" You can be born male or female, and you can have a personality and preferences that might or might not conform with the socially constructed parametres of what is ""normal"" for a ""girl"" or ""boy."" Persons who do not conform are perfectly fine the way they are. There is no reason to intervene. They can just be whoever they want to be. It is not unlikely that they will experience dysphoria resulting from the societal pressures to conform to gender roles during childhood and adolescence, but most overcome this dysphoria and go on to be whoever they want in the bodies they have. If we could simply abolish gender roles entirely, this wouldn't be a problem. 

Persons with a psychiatric disorder who believe that their body is not the correct sex, however, may require medical and/or surgical intervention, the same way that body dysmorphic disorder is sometimes best treated surgically. In recent cases, that has involved removing healthy limbs or chemically blinding someone who believes they are supposed to be blind. These are extreme measures, to be sure, and should be considered very carefully, as they are irreversible. However, if the outcome is a much better quality of life for that individual, then that's clearly the better option. It would be absurd to withhold care from people with a disorder who would otherwise suffer without treatment.  No one wants that. 

I'm not worried about that second set of people. They are having their voices heard. They are increasingly getting access to care.

I'm worried about the first set - boys and girls who simply don't fit into gender roles proscribed for them, being told or being encouraged to believe that because they don't fit into the social construct, they must have been ""born in the wrong body"" and need to change their bodies to match their personalities. That's simply incorrect, medically unsound, and demonstrably unnecessary.

Personality disorders are called disorders for a reason. Because they lead to disordered behaviour and conflict-ridden relationships.

If you really just want to jump in there, finding a couple that wants a playmate is also a way to approach it, but obviously you'd have to screen for couples that include a bi or bi-curious man.

753,"&gt; Why don't you believe in unicorns?

I super would LOVE for unicorns to be real, or for them to have been real. But so far, there is no credible archaeological or paleozoological evidence to support their existence. There is also not a gap in the fossil record of the evolution of the modern horse, that could explain an offshoot line of horse-like animals who grew horns out of their skulls. There are, however, many other species (caribou, rhinos, narwhals, and [these cool one-horned buffalo-like creatures from Kazakhstan](http://thescipub.com/PDF/ajassp.2016.189.199.pdf)) who are similar enough to unicorns to explain the origin of the mythology. So barring an amazing paleozoological discovery of several unicorn specimens, I remain skeptical that they ever lived.

I would, however, LOVE for some mad scientist to develop one through gene manipulation. That said, as an avid rider, I would really not love how much more dangerous it would be to try to harness a horse that now has a long pointy-stabby-thing jutting out of it's face. Also, equine behaviour would need alter drastically as a result of this skeletal addition, or horses would go around goring each other during affectionate play. I can see that going really badly really quickly. It would probably necessitate the addition of protective gear. And the painful growing process would probably interfere with the very years (1-3) when we most need to interact with and train foals and young horses to be suitable for riding. Imagine how ornery a filly or colt might be during ""horning"" season. Not to mention the plethora of obnoxious ""horny""-related puns we would be subjected to. Not to mention the increased strain on the already strained neck and spine of the equine skeleton, by adding a 1-2lb bone on it's face. For a few minutes, it might be fun, but imagine the neck strain of carrying that around all your life. Starts to get pretty heavy. Overall - not a good idea, I'm thinking. Certainly no kindness to the creature created.

&gt; What if someone told you that they have a pet unicorn? Would you believe it?

I would assume they meant they had a pony with a horn attached. So.... no.

&gt; What if there was a very old book about unicorns? Would that be valid evidence that they once existed?

There are many of these. Still no. 

&gt; What if there was a place that claimed to be a unicorn sanctuary. No one actually sees unicorns at the sanctuary, but people who pay to visit believe that there are unicorns there even though they haven't seen them. What do you think of this unicorn sanctuary and the people who visit?

I would go to this place, and imagine unicorns there. It might even be a peaceful, restful place to hang out. I would enjoy talking to the other people about what they think and believe about unicorns, past and present, and I would probably wear my unicorn shirt. But I wouldn't believe that actual unicorns lived there, no.

759,"&gt;  if you do look forward to death

There is a big difference between saying you accept and are relieved that after death, we stop existing, and actively ""looking forward"" to it. If you only want to talk to atheists who ""look forward to death"" then you're narrowing your pool of respondents quite significantly. 

I do not ""look forward to"" (as in, anticipate with excitement a future pleasurable experience) death because there is nothing to which to look forward. I won't experience being dead, at all. My consciousness won't exist.

But I am relieved to know that after this life is over, there is no eternity ahead of me. That seems vastly worse. I would like to have a lot more time though. I would love to have, like, 500 years or, 5 or so lives, to live, but I think that time would soon seem like not enough, and no different from only one, and ultimately I'd be facing the same dilemma - would it be better to be able to cease existing, or to be completely unable to cease existing? And I still think it would be better to able to cease existing.


&gt; if you... don't mind being dead/ finally being at peace/without conscious anymore and with no more drama then why not be dead now? To just experience pleasure? That seems pretty hedonistic.

See above. But I'll still address the implied question, which is ""what is the point of living if you only die at the end?""

That's a deep and more profound question than you might realize. But ultimately, it depends on the individual person, what kind of meaning they derive out of their existence. For me, the point is to experience the material reality of life fully (in the form of having and raising a family, travelling, experiencing new things, and forming close interpersonal connections to other living things), and to improve the world for those living things who will come after me. 

You may think it's ""hedonistic"" to want to experience life, but how is that morally inferior to wanting to be rewarded for your  good works in a future world? How is reward-based motivation not self-absorbed and pleasure-centred? It is, imo, more laudable to do good for it's own sake. 

&gt; Secondly, if life really does end after death and we will for eternity cease to exist then doesn't that make all the things you've accomplished in life pointless and a waste of time in the end? Because of the legacy or your contribution to society and the human race?

First of all, your worldly legacy/contribution/achievements in life are no more meaningful, if your immaterial ""soul"" is being transported to another plane of existence. How much does your individuality and life on earth really matter if you are just being sorted into tiers with billions upon billions of other anonymous formerly-living people (and pets? apparently dogs go to heaven too...). Or perhaps you believe that the whole point of heaven is the pleasure of being in God's company (whatever form that takes). How is that not selfish and pleasure-seeking? 

What would be the point of life eternal? You can't experience anything, because you can no longer receive any data input, and you can't process it either, because the mechanism for it (your brain) is long dead. Is your consciousness just frozen in time? Nothing that happens can have any consequence, because there is no next, next life. No afterafterlife. Seems like a punt, but without any kind of terminal release from a never-ending eternity without growth, change, suffering, conflict, or joy.

Or perhaps believe you will join some vast amalgamation of all previously-living souls, joining with some universal spirit, which subsequently utterly subsumes your previous individuality. How did anything you did on earth have any meaning in the afterlife, if you no longer exist as an individual?

Besides, according to many Grace-based theologies, nothing you do on this earth has any effect, at all, on whether or not you will be saved for a future existence with god. 

So, yet again, I fail to see how human behaviour is of greater consequence when adding an afterlife belief. I challenge the idea that a world-view where life ends with eternal existence on some spiritual plane somehow allows for greater ""meaning"" or ""purpose"" for life on this earth. (Let alone the fact there is absolutely no reason other than fear or hope to believe in any version of an afterlife.)

Regardless, I do think contributions to future generations are a good enough purpose in life. Why should my life, the life of just me, this one person, necessarily be of greater consequence than the positive (or, I suppose, negative) influence I can have on other living things that co-exist or come after me? Who am I to presume that just because I am, my life matters and must have cosmic, eternal significance? That sounds egomaniacal. I'm but one women. When the last person on earth has forgotten that I ever existed, I will be utterly forgotten, like almost every other person who has ever lived and come before me. Though I suppose my facebook page will live on for some time. Lol. 

&gt; Does that really make it meaningful when in time the human race will eventually die, be destroyed and become extinct? 

Well, we can certainly delay our extinction by several billion years if we get it together, but at this rate, that's starting to look unlikely. Of course, the ""New Earth"" narrative of biblical literalists (who believe they will be given new bodies, possibly constituted from their old bodies, in order to live with the resurrected Jesus on a New Earth here or maybe somewhere else, but definitely a physically real place, where they live in physical bodies) and the various reincarnation beliefs of other religions, also become moot if we start talking about the scale of time that you're talking about.


&gt; In the end we will all only be dust of the galaxy. 

Yes. That's what will happen. That's also what would happen under many afterlife narratives, anyway, which depend on the existence of a material reality within which to house their afterlife. The eventual heat-death of the universe will destroy all of that. As for those who believe in an immaterial afterlife, well, I still don't see the point or reward in that, and still reject the premise that that existence somehow mades earthly life more meaningful. 

All will be consumed in the eventual heat death of the universe, and, possibly, a new universe will form and expand, and new life will emerge and evolve. I wish I could be around to see it, but alas. I can only imagine it.

&gt; Are all of our goals and accomplishments in vain if it the end it will all be destroyed with no memory remaining?

It's not in vain to me, or to my loved ones. To the uncaring, unknowing, vast emptiness of the cosmos? Sure. So?

-----------------

Just for clarification, I wanted to add that I'm a mortalist, and an apatheist. I believe that conscious human life ends with death, and that we life in a deterministic (or, more accurately, probabilistic) reality. I'm apathetic about the existence of a higher power because a) he or she isn't actively doing anything in this life and b) there is no next life - so therefore the existence of a god is irrelevant. 

BUT, I became a mortalist long before I gave up on the belief in a god, because, for a long time, I was comforted by the notion of a god who passively observes and knows all, and remembers everything. The eternal, collective memory of all humans and all living things, a document, of sorts. Someone to remember us all. It's a nice thought. I just don't think it's anything more than a nice thought.

760,"That's a belief of Calvinism, and many Baptists today, certainly. The theory is that either you never truly believed, or if you did, then you probably will again before the end of your life. But none of that affects your salvation, which is based on grace-alone anyway. Your belief is but a symptom of the condition of being elect.

Other people, like some Evangelicals, believe that as long as you truly believed at any point in your life, and were saved, you can never be unsaved, even if you lose your belief.

That's sort of true for some sacramental or works-based groups too, in that they will tell you that if you had the necessary infant baptism then your soul is saved or could be saved (by ending up in purgatory) and you would only be accountable for sins committed since the last time you made a confession (sins all prior sins are already absolved).",2016-05-18 17:39:18+00:00,d3ah6ue,1.0,t3_4j6ibq,444241.0,DebateReligion
761,"Oh I see, you believe them to be hypocrites, with regard to their use vs their stance on pornography.

Many of them are probably sexual compulsives, and while most may not own up to their behaviour or make any sincere attempt to change, those who do are probably going to be hard to distinguish, because sexual compulsivity is an extremely difficult thing to overcome, particularly without effective intervention, to which likely none of them have access. 

Regardless, I think you would find there are quite a lot of people, in and out of prison, with conflicting or possibly hypocritical stances on their personal use vs. what they think ought to be legal. I think at least some of them may feel their own issues/temptations/addictions/etc would be alleviated if they didn't have such easy access to it (and in this case, ""it"" could be any number of things.)

That said, for everyday parlance, atheism remains the more widely-used term, and since language must remain functional (that is, comprehensible by people for the purpose of exchanging information), the overwhelming preference, at this time, will be to opt for the better known term.

835,"Let's take one issue at a time.

1) Fake Pictures: this one is easily rectified by just coming clean. Tear off the bandaid: you were nervous about trying grindr, you're closeted, and you tried your best to minimize the deception by choosing someone very similar. Do this at the same time that you send an actual picture.

2) Him knowing your friends - chances are, if he likes you and is gay, he will both understand your need for discretion and respect it. That's just a leap of faith you'll have to take if you want to move forward. That said, if he's out, he's probably going to want to have hope that you'll eventually come out too.

3) Which bring me to your family - you might be surprised how families adjust when someone they love, trust, and respect, comes out. The process can bring about real change and growth. That said, it doesn't need to be a sudden thing. Many a gay man has brought his ""friend"" or ""roommate"" home for family holidays for years before people eventually cotton on and, because nothing else has changed and they already know the partner, it's resulted in limited or no conflict. Ultimately, it's up to you how you handle your family, but don't write them off categorically without giving them a chance to surprise you.

4) I advise against mixed-orientation relationships. If you are bisexual, that's different. But if you find that you are gay, or gay enough that your overwhelming preference for a long-term sex partner is for a man, then you're better off with a male partner in the long term.

This is what my former-literalist partner always replies. And I just don't see the logic that if some of the documents contained in the anthology were written or adapted by people with political or personal motives, that that discounts the inspired nature of other parts of the text. The text remains our only account of the life of Yeshua of Nazareth, and one of few documents to survive through the history of the Hebrews and later Judea. 

But clearly stories like the Garden of Eden or the Flood of Noah are myths that might be inspired by a universal truth (sin, forgiveness) but are written into a simplified narrative to be easy for people to understand and relate to. Not literal truth, that would be silly. I don't think the people who told those stories and passed them down for generations believed them to be literally true, either, they believed them to contain truth. That's an easily defensible claim when you consider the open canon of the Judaism today, for example, as well as examining the relationship between myth, truth, and storytelling in other cultures with rich oral traditions.

* Five Stars: This book is a true blessing from heaven!!! When our 8 year old son wanted to buy a pink shirt, we were beside ourselves with grief. After putting Dr. Abbott and Dr. Byrd's methods to use, our adolescent son is now a pillar of the straight community. At 16 he's already impregnated 4 girls because we were able to teach him all the right tools to properly engage in successful heterosexual intercourse. If that's not enough, just last week he got in trouble at school for punching a homosexual boy for walking too close to him. We couldn't be more proud of his success at life, and it's all thanks to this book!",2016-03-30 13:37:07+00:00,d1j0pyl,1.0,t3_4cdo6p,124009.0,exmormon

946,"1. How is your relationship going?

Pretty well! Some stressors, but also lots of happiness and exciting news. For one - we're engaged, and we've finally told our friends and families! We're also expanding our social circle, and slowly turning out home into a home where people want to come and visit all the time, which is great, because that's exactly what we want. 

2. What are you excited or worried about?

I'm excited about moving forward with our relationship, but I'm worried about our financial situation, our careers, and my partner's mental health. We both need to look for new jobs and start on new education tracks - I'm going to grad school, he's leaving a grad program to start community college in a different (though related) field, possibly. His depression is taking a toll on our lives, though, and on his career. And on my mental health. I did find a therapist though, and that is helping. I'm a little bit manic right now, and he's quite depressed, so for now, it's balancing out. I am drinking too much, though, but I'm working on it.

3. If someone came up to you with the same situation, how would you walk them through it?

No idea. I'm doing pretty much what I would advise, which is to support him seeking professional help and medication, surrounding him with a support system of family and friends, and speaking his love languages, which are words of affirmation and acts of service.

4. What would help you feel better?

964,"1. Some people hit it off digitally quite quickly, but most people need to meet in person to really get to know each other. 

2. Typically, there is a conversation. One of you will ask - ""what are we doing here?"" and you will define your relationship - ""just dating"" vs ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" and it's terms - will it be short term only because one you will move next year? will it be monogamous or non-monogamous? What are you each looking for?

3. Try not to fall too hard too soon. You need to meet lots of people before you know what kind of person you actually like to be in a relationship with. 

4. It helps to know that - and it could definitely speed up the process, and should make the conversation go more smoothly when you decide to talk about it, because you've already discussed your preferences.

5. It's different for everyone, and every relationship. But for me, personally, it's usually pretty instantaneous that I know I like someone, and I fall for them, typically, fairly soon (within a few weeks, and after we've had quite a bit of sex). 

6. You seem to have a good pattern going. Yes - tough it out until you know him well enough. Make careful observations and ask questions to clarify. You will probably prefer partners who communicate directly and clearly, if you have autism, so I would select for that trait. Someone who is vague, or bothered by direct questions, will be frustrating to try to communicate with.

7. A history of terrible break ups, pressuring you to commit to present or future sexual activity, abusive family patterns, without any desire to change that. Drugs or over-drinking on your first date.

994,"No one has said that the existence of transwomen erases women. I specifically said that deleting the word ""woman"" from institutions that primarily serve women is erasure.

As for your sense of self - that is a construct, as it is for everyone. The ""innate, essential, inner woman"" narrative is unsupportable with any kind of data, and indeed is undermined by the existing research. It's a narrative that is easy to explain and easy to relate to, but it doesn't hold up to scrutiny. I understand the appeal. Yet there is no male brain or female brain in a meaningful sense, because there is vastly more overlap than differentiation on virtually every measure, between male and female people. To claim an essential, innate gender is to utterly invert the very basis of feminist theory about gender as socially constructed. 

Part of the problem is that transtheory, presumably to be more polite, uses the term ""gender"" when they mean ""sex."" These are not interchangeable. If you have an inner sense that you are the wrong sex, and experience the intense body dysmorphia that accompanies GID, this is a known medical condition and the agreed upon best course of treatment is, often, medical intervention. I have no problem with that. 

That's a completely separate issue from the narrative we hear again and again about an ""inner woman"" based on a person's mere mannerisms, sexual orientation, preferences, and personality, when they do not conform to the gender roles assigned to their sex. Thence springs the idea that in order to conform they should simply opt to change sex in order conform to the other sex's assigned gender roles. THAT is the problem, because it suggests absurd, indefensible claims like ""liking pink"" and ""playing with dolls"" as a child are ""girl things."" If a boy does it, it's a boy thing. It doesn't matter if it's statistically unusual for boys (though neither of those are particularly unusual). It's normal for a boy to have a range of interests and preferences, we should encourage diversity of expression, not pigeonhole people into socially constructed gender categories, and when someone fails to conform, encourage them to alter themselves so that they can better conform. Add to that the reality that 80% or more of children who experience gender dysphoria grow out of it and move on, and there are good reasons to be cautious about life-changing medical intervention.

These two things are unrelated, though, right?

I don't think that's what researchers assume at all. They are looking at users and non-users and trying to assess measurable differences.

I disagree with your characterization of gender critical feminism, which is not a movement, but a theoretical framework. One that competes with trans-theory. Feminism's core and founding concept is that gender is socially constructed, and used to oppress people based on biological sex. You can't have social constructivism and gender essentialism at the same time. They are competing theories. Transpeople can certainly be compatible. Transtheory is not.

Erasing sex and replacing it with a internal, essential ""gender"" is problematic for a million reasons. That does NOT invalidate the medical necessity for some people to be treated for their gender dysphoria.

1013,"The pills are basically just ulcer medication, but they are known to have the side effect of inducing a period, or if you are pregnant, a miscarriage. So they are used as abortifacients - a drug that's used to abort a pregnancy. You generally take 2, one the first day and one the second day, though sometimes they are dispensed at lower doses and you have to take multiple pills over those two days.

The abortion will feel like a painful period. You will cramp and bleed. If you are pregnant and its only a few weeks along, you might not even see the pregnancy when it expels, it will just look like a clump of blood.

You should definitely look up the specific laws in your country, because many countries in Europe have a cut-off at 12 weeks, and you will need to find a clinic, and depending on where you are, you might need to save up money for it. Here in the US, it would take you a LONG time - you'd have to go back several times for multiple visits, texts, and probes, but hopefully that won't be the case for you. You should be able to just go in, take a blood test to confirm, get a prescription, and then go home.

But even if pretended that they do, the deprivation of bodily resources from a pregnant women is measurably different from the responsibilities a parent has to a born child in their custody. 

The only valid comparison is organ donation. You are not obliged to donate an organ, even if it would save someone else's life. Even if they need that kidney to live because you hit them with your car. While drunk driving. Even if you were *dead,* killed in your own drunk driving accident, and your victim is dying and needs your organ in order to live - you would still have the right to withhold your bodily resources and not share them with another person, regardless of their innocence in the situation or that their life depended on you help.

1142,"I met both of my most recent LTRs on OKC, including my (now) fiance! I really believe in the algorithm they use to pair people.

I will give you a little bit of advice, as a girl on OKC who genuinely does want to meet people (my relationship is open) but also tends to get stuck into conversation ruts that never lead anywhere -- the sooner you can meet someone in person, the better. If you get to be too close via messaging, suddenly there is more emotional investment, and it feels riskier to meet, because it will hurt if you don't hit it off. IME, it's best to meet as soon as possible. 

Of course, that's hard to do, because of course you don't want to spook them, and being pushy about meeting might scare them off. I think the best recourse is not to aim for a date, but to aim for a simple, free, easy, public activity to do together. Example: bring a board game to play at the cafe of a book store one afternoon. It should be an activity that can easily be cut short, is conveniently nearby, and doesn't cost either of you anything. Also - day time is preferable. If you drink coffee, you could go for coffee, too, but I think it's good to have a space to stroll around, and something to do, in case you're slow to get into a conversation. Try inviting them for something low-key like that just to get to meet each other, and make it clear you aren't expecting anything, you may find them amenable.

The only dubious ""need"" not being met here is that he wants her to get off, and she can't/won't/doesn't want to. *He* is getting off just fine. 

&gt; It is not wrong for him to pursue fulfillment in his sexual life. Everything needn't be about her. Sex is about two people, its ok for him to have needs/wants just like it is ok for her to. 

Sure, but what he says he needs from her is for her to orgasm, and she doesn't want to. She has set that boundary. She's allowed to do that. If his sexual gratification is dependent on her orgasm, that's his issue, and he will need to work it out for himself, because while he is free to ask, she is also free to say no. 

No one is saying their entire sex life should be all about her. But her orgasm *is* actually about her. If he wants to be happy in his relationship, he will have to meet his partner half-way.

1) You appreciate the spirit with which she is approaching you. You know that she wants you to be happy, and have the joy that she is experiencing on her religious journey.

2) Religion will not meet those needs for you. You are happy for her, but it will do for you what it does for her.

3) Your reasons for your beliefs are private, she can ask you about them when you are no longer colleagues.

4) You respect her choice to belief and practice Christianity, and you would appreciate if she would also respect your beliefs and refrain from trying to evangelize.

I also absolutely respect those who, like my partner, cannot and will not simply ""say the words"" in order to not upset anyone, because doing so compromises their integrity.

But for me.... I think it's best to make my choices based on what will harm the fewest people. If I was in your position, I might find words that are truthful but hopeful, to express something that will alleviate her fears. I suggest putting it in writing, on a card or something, maybe for mother's day. It will be something she can cling to, and will hopefully forestall further interrogations for you.

1309,"Eh, I've never really doubted that a person named Yeshua the Nazarene existed, there is enough written and oral tradition, and a wide enough initial spread of primitive Christianity in the region to justify it.

I think Reza Aslan stretches what we know about the historical Yeshua. But I do think that John Hamm, an ex-LDS CoC pastor, does have a pretty decent summary of what we can reasonably extrapolate:

Yeshua was an illiterate peasant carpenter, likely with a family whom he left behind when he went to follow his charismatic cousin John the Baptist. After John is arrested and beheaded, Yeshua resumes his ministry for a short time, until he arrives in Jerusalem and starts a riot in the temple, after which he is captured and executed (either for sedition, by crucifixion, or for some other petty crime, by some other method), and his remains most likely ended up in an unmarked communal pauper's grave. His brother James continues the John and Yeshua tradition for several more decades. Sometime in the 80 years after Yeshua's death, people start writing down some of the oral traditions.

That is, imo, the very most we can possibly say about the historical figure of Yeshua the Nazarene, and it might be a patchwork of multiple different Rabbi's and apocalyptic preachers from the period, so it's still just a guess.

As for the so-called ""empty-tomb"" - how exactly is this compelling evidence? It's just a story.

Here's what I can tell you:

All that you are - everything about you, your ideas, your memories, your ticks, your depression, your fear, your personality, your self-deception, your thoughts, your feelings... all of it - is the product of your neurology. Consciousness and thought - the ability to be awake and self-aware, the ability to think and reason, to communicate with self and others through language, to decide, question, remember, learn, invent, grow - all of it, is just an organic process happening in your brain. All of it is data whirring around on organic neural structures. 

When your brain stops working, all of that data and all of those structures will disappear and degrade precipitously. Once you are brain-dead, everything about who you are is gone. Forever. You are dead.

So, don't worry about an afterlife, good or bad. Nothing that makes you you will survive the death of your brain. There will be nothing left to go to hell. ",2016-02-22 20:01:36+00:00,d09njcr,1.0,t3_451epb,1085562.0,exchristian

This was never really a conflict for me, fortunately, because I grew up Episcopalian, so a non-literal interpretation was perfectly welcome and in no way invalidated the text.

1357,"One more thing: re intimacy. When I first started dating my current partner (who was a newly deconverted, forner biblical literalist), he would never initiate sex. He had been so burned by his ex wife and being turned down again and again and again that he was too hurt and afraid to deal with it anymore, and just relied on me to initiate
 We talked about this a lot and it seemed to me like the best strategy, if I wanted a lot of sex, was to simply accommodate him in patience and revisit the issue now and then. It took at 9 months of having sex nearly every day we were together, for him to initiate. And then it slowly worked it's way to normal. One way we adjusted to make this possible was having a conversation about it early on in the evening, typically as soon as my daughter was in bed. We would make a plan for the evening, which basically scheduled in sex if we were wanting to do that. That does take away some spontaneity, but it replaces with security and realistic expectations. Also, we are busy people; if we don't prioritize sex, it likely won't happen. So it's sex is a priority for us, then we need to prioritize it. That's a skill we've been working on diligently.

Besides, just because the bulk of your everyday bread-and-butter intimacy is planned ahead, doesn't mean you can't ever be spontaneous. We are! But relying exclusively unpredictable, spontaneous sex just isn't going to result in the kind of outcomes we want. It will result in crossed wires and unmet needs, and is too easily subject to whim and can result in hurt feelings and secrets. We want healthy, fulfilling, mutual intimacy on a near-daily basis.

1359,"My partners deconversion shortly after getting married to his first wife (a woman whom he pulled back into the church and insisted on waiting until marriage to have sex with, and who basically re-converted to conservative christianity for him in the 2ish years preceeding their marriage) was at least in part influential in their their ultimate divorce. I do not know the degree to which the lack of sex in their marriage was the result of religiosity in her part, but I imagine it also contributed to that additional cause for their divorce. Though the yelling and fighting, and her aversion to having children, neither of those were especially influenced by religion, and both were also major contributing factors.

1361,"Accepting the mortal nature of humanity was actually the first step for me, not the afterthought of losing belief in a religion or a God. I retained my god-belief and was still a practicing Christian long after I decided that death must be final and the Bible is either full of true metaphor, or just a book. When questioned, I would respond that the Kingdom of Heaven is meant to be here on earth. It's all an allegory. Etc etc.

Anyway... loss. Yes, losing a loved one for the first time after relinquishing your afterlife beliefs will be hard. My partner, who deconverted only a few years ago, faced this with his grandmother last spring, and his grandfather this month. It is always hard. But deceiving yourself into believing that this permanent and irreversible loss is somehow reversible, is unnecessary.

The people you love impact you, and stay alive in your memory, and in the memories of your children, if you keep them alive in stories, photo-albums, and objects around your home. Human memory, and documentation, is the only kind of immortality we can hope for.

This realization should come with a sudden desire to spend more time with the living people in your life whom you might lose. Act on it! Those resting in the assurance of a second chance can justify not flying home for holidays to see their family, but we must not! We cannot change death. But we can change the way that we choose to live, to spend as much time with people as possible, truly listen to them, and know them for who they are, so that we may hold on to that when they leave us forever. 

This is one of many ways, I think, that waking up to reality actually fosters living a better life, than the self-deception of religiosity.",2016-02-20 18:19:22+00:00,d078k43,1.0,t3_46p8qc,37200.0,exchristian

If I like someone, I'm more likely to wait, because doing so will make the sex better. But of course, when I say ""wait"" I typically mean a couple of days at most.

My current partner I talked to on OKC on a Wednesday and Thursday, then on Friday I asked him on a date (free, at a book store, low-key) and we ended up talking for hours and making out in his car. And then the next night we hung out again and did finally have sex for the first time. That wasn't our first date but it *was* still within about 28 hours of meeting each other. And then the following day he took me on a lovely dinner date, we learned each other's last names, and we had a fantastic time at live theatre, and learned we were both bisexual and preferred open relationships. About 2 weeks later we said ""I love you."" That was 18 months ago and we are now engaged.

My point is - whether or not you have sex on the first date, or within the first 24 hours or meeting, or wait, etc - none of that will affect the future of your relationship as much as the chemistry and compatibility between you.

&gt; I have never known a man who is not like this.

&gt; Each may express it in his own unique way but the underlying theme is the same.

&gt; Men are held captive by their own biology.

&gt; It is my opinion that it is this biology that results in violence, criminality, anti-social personality disorder, sociopathy and psychotic disorders being much more prevalent in men than women.

&gt; If you read up on these kinds of disorders, it shows that same poor thinking habits and narcissism inherent in all men express themselves in a more extreme variety in mental illnesses. Men universally have behaviour issues (living with a permanent drive to rape and murder) making them vulnerable to violent outbursts. Without self-control or a permanent sense of who they are as men in the worlse, disempowerment or emasculation become terrifying because they lose themselves when the person they have found their identity through leaves.

&gt; Men cannot form identities because the hormones change so often they never have the inner peace/quiet that allows for contemplation. Without this ability they never can define themselves so live with the inner emptiness of being without substance just as children and young adults do. And when the shaky foundation of their sense of self is undermined, they lash out in violence against others weaker than them, in a desperate bid to assert some form of dominance.

&gt; For men their identity is always outside themselves because they are chemically (testosterone)separated from themselves (irrationality caused by testosterone). 

&gt; Men show a life long pattern of the same instability, violence, and criminality you see in those going through puberty, making them the oldest teenager in the house.

1504,"&gt; When I found out i was pregnant, i had only been dating her dad for a year, he promised he would stay by me as well as my mom. I thought I had a really good support system and could make it. I never wanted to be a mom ever, but I was 20 and naive thinking peoples promises meant something.

Hi, I believe we are the same person. 

&gt; Her crying immediately gives me a headache, she whines and has a breakdown over everything, i hide in the laundry room to get some peace. 

I made the same choices you did, at 20. And the years my daughter was 4 and 5 were especially difficult. I was alone, working fulltime, and relapsing slowly into mental unwellness and drug use. It was a dark time. But let me promise you this - she will grow out of the 3s. She'll get older, and she'll be more like a person and less like a monster. 

&gt; I keep on thinking of the what ifs, what if I never met her dad? what if I was free? what if I never had her? what if i was happy?

I do this too, when I'm in a particularly dark place. But the truth is, there is no point dwelling on it. I only have one life to live, and yes, it's now very, very different from what I wanted or what my friends all have. But the only way forward is forward. 


&gt; I made a horrible choice in partners by picking her dad and now my daughter is stuck with having a shitty dad for the rest of her life because I did not make a good choice back in the day.

This is both true and not true. It's true that she will be stuck with a jerk for a bio-dad, but you are young, you could still meet someone new and she could still have a great, loving, feminist, supportive dad to look up to. It's not too late! But even if that never happens, she does have you. She doesn't actually *need* a dad, as long as the people in her life who care for her are meeting her needs and she's securely attached to them.

&gt; Dating and finding a good dad example is basically non existent in the cards, I feel like I have a huge red flag on my chest saying 'I'm a single mom, so I will be easy to hook up with'.

Let me just speak from experience here - no, your single-motherhood needn't prevent you from dating. If you live in the US, single mothers are pretty ubiquitous in the dating world, you won't be the odd one out. What makes you exceptional is that you are young and she is still young. Which means if you met someone, you could take your time and still have plenty of time to form a family (with or without additional children) before she's a teenager and is no longer willing to bond to a new caregiver.

We are deeply committed to an active (and penetrative) sex life as the foundation of a healthy relationship. 

Most of my rad-fem friends can't get past their ideas about patriarchy being enacted through the male penetrating the female body, and idea of sex-as-violence. I don't think either of those are invalid at all. They just don't apply to me and my lived experience. Even as an assault survivor.

Regardless, imo, it's not so much PIV, it's pregnancy (or the threat of it) that enacts patriarchy, by reducing a woman to a vessel, a means of production, in the way we construct pregnancy in western culture and in our restrictive and sexist laws. Women are subjugated not just because they can be fucked (after all, men can be fucked too) but because it can threaten their lives and bind them to you indefinitely (as in the case of purchasing your rape victim, child marriage, and rapists suing for parental rights of offspring borne of their violence).

* Watermark church has a really cool indoor jungle-gym / tree-house, and it's cool in the summer, warm in the winter. Lots of nice comfy couches where you are visit or read/colour/nurse. Also a mother's room with a rocking chair and changing table right by the play area. Very clean, quiet, and safe. You don't have to be a member or a christian, anyone is welcome to go in an play during open hours.

* Michael's locations around the city offer free craft classes for children and adults, including a free guided kids activity most Saturdays from 10am-3pm. Call ahead though, the schedule varies. 

* North Park and Galleria are both lovely to walk around. North Park has the ducks and turtles area, and the Galleria has a play area for kids on the upper floor, as well as the opportunity to watch the ice-skaters.

* Carrollton has a lovely greenbelt with a little lake over by Josey and Peter's Colony that has tonnes of birds to feed and a nice bike path to walk along. Lots of cool wildlife. 

* Public Libraries all over the city host kids activities throughout the week, including story and craft time. The main one in down town shows movies on Sundays, I believe. 

* SMU campus has a wonderful water fountain right outside of Dallas Hall, and beautifully kept lawn, which is great for letting kids run around, having a picnic, or playing in the fountain (better done in the summer time). 

* UTD Campus also has fountains and places to walk - go as a ""guest"" and get a pass at the office and you won't have to pay for parking. Limit 3 guest passes per week, I think. They also have a cool little geology garden and some displays of gemstones, rock formations, fossils, etc in the adjoining buildings. Just be quiet, classes may be in session. 

* The Dallas Museum of Art has a wonderful children's area with tactile activities, etc. Admission to the main museum and children's area is free of charge. 

* Katy Trail is a fun place to go for a walk, and they have wild parrots living in the trees just south of Henderson Ave.

You're 19 - if you want to go to college, have a career, and actually be independent from your parents during your twenties, then having a child now will make all of those things mostly impossible. It will rob you of your 20s completely. Your social life will diminish or disappear. The bio-dad will resent you, maybe pay some minimal child support, but probably leave you when he goes to college or moves for a job, because he never wanted a kid in the first place. You will likely resent and regret the child as well. I know. I've been there.

And that's a miserable way to live the rest of your life. Even if you do want to raise kids, starting now will mean your child has drastically worse outcomes, statistically speaking. And if you later meet another person, and want to have kids when you are actually ready, you'll already be financially disadvantaged by an existing child, and your future children will have fewer resources.

There is financial assistance available for women who cannot afford their abortions. Go to Planned Parenthood or another abortion clinic and get some advice and resources. The sooner you start, the better, because you the clock is ticking, and 5 weeks feels early now, but you only have a short time before your window closes. Do not delay.


That said - it's up to you. You're an adult. Its your body. I recommend adoption over keeping it, if you don't want to abort. If you decide to let this pregnancy grow into a baby, then you owe that baby the best chance you can possibly give it, for a happy life. Adoption is not an easy life, but it's probably better than growing up without means, and with a mother too young to properly raise it.

Please, please, please think carefully and try to make your decision based on what is best for everyone, not based on how the pregnancy hormones are making you feel. ",2016-01-21 17:04:13+00:00,cz6o3sb,1.0,t3_41hfo1,302517.0,TwoXChromosomes

1603,"You're probably past the viability cut off. If you can drive or take a greyhound to Colorado or New Mexico, you can still get a late 2nd term or 3rd term abortion if you want one. In CO, the Boulder Abortion Clinic is run by Dr. Hern. In NM, you want to look up the Southwest Women's Surgical Center. Both will do late term, no need for any reason other than that you want it. But the procedures are expensive, and you will need to apply for financial assistance. If you are truly dirt poor, you will hopefully qualify. Both clinics provide help applying for assistance. Also a note - late 2nd term and 3rd term abortions take a few days, so you will need to find a place to crash. Hern's clinic *might* be able to refer you to lodging. Its going to be an expensive ordeal.


If you can't make all of that happen, then she's probably just going to have to deliver it, and then you all can give it up for adoption.

Trauma can also, to an extent, affect arousal templates enough to at least add same-sex attraction, if not eliminate opposite-sex attraction.

For women, it's more nebulous. We have reason to believe it may be genetic and/or epigenetic, though there is no evidence so far that the hormonal/uterine environment can influence orientation in women. There is also some evidence that trauma can effect women's orientation permanently, through altered or destroyed arousal templates. But female-exclusive homosexuality is quite rare by comparison to male.

Interestingly, female bisexuality is more common, compared to men. Personally I suspect this is largely due to cultural constraints and that we will see more open bisexuality as it becomes safer and more accepted.

Its an adaptive way of coping with stress, trauma, grief, etc, for many, many, many people. We should not judge them for choosing to cling to a belief that gives them comfort in dark times. At least, I deeply believe we should not.

If you cannot bring yourself to affirm their statements, you can always say, ""yes, that's a comforting thought"" or ""many of my patients hold on to that hope to help them through it"" etc. Just vague and non-committal but true statements. If they ask you to pray for them, assure them that you'll be ""thinking of them."" 

If you can. If it goes against your conscience too much, then you must do what you think is right. But this is entirely up to you. ",2016-01-20 18:58:17+00:00,cz5i59r,1.0,t3_41u35m,24208.0,atheism

Seriously? The worth of a person varies based on how much you, personally, gain from them? It's hard to even wrap my brain around that kind of self-centredness. 

Equality is not about how useful people are to your day to day life, but lets go down that rabbit hole anyway. Did you put on clothes today? Some teenaged girl probably sewed those for you. Did you use your smartphone to listen to music? A woman in china probably assembled that for you. Another one sewed your shoes together, seam by seam. Did you eat anything? There is a good chance the food prep was done by a woman. I could go on.

In fact, I will: Do you have job? The person who processed your paperwork was probably a woman. Did you go to school? Most of your teachers were probably women. Do you have health insurance? Have you been to the doctor in the last few years? The nurse, MA, staff, and assistants, if not the doctor herself, were all probably women. And when they submitted your claims to be filed, they were filed, read, adjudicated, processed, and paid by a woman, mostly likely. Chances are, if you called to ask them a question about the claim, the person on the other line was also a woman. Ever use the library? Have kids who need to cross the street to go to school? Use childcare of any kind? Those day to day services are also, most likely, provided by women. Maybe count, tomorrow, how many women serve you food, sell you groceries, take your toll in the toll lane, answer your customer service call. 

And then, of course, there is the fact that when you were born, every single cell in your body came from your mother except for 1/2 of 1 cell, contributed by your biological father. The rest - every single molecule that went into the formation of every single cell, was sucked out of your mother's body.

1705,"I cited the 2007 study as requested, not because it's particularly good. Good thing there have been follow up studies done. Regardless, this guy:

&gt; a guy waking up his girlfriend by fondling her vagina 

Isn't going to be included, most likely, because why would she report that as a bad thing? (Of course, I'm assuming when you say ""vagina"" you mean ""vulva"" in the way many men often mislabel female genitalia. If you mean he's actually penetrating her before she's even awake, then yeah, that's creepy as hell and could be really disturbing to wake up to). 

The 2014 study has been cited in the last year all over the place, has a much large sample size, and draws from different college and university settings. But both of them are exclusively looking at college-aged students. For that population, those kinds of pot and drug usage stats are pretty representative. 

As for drunk sex - I know in the West, particularly in college culture, completely drunk sex is so normalized that it's apparently offensive to suggest that the people involved are not able to legally consent, but it's still true that they cannot. And when there is a differential in the degree of inebriation, it's easy for one person to take advantage of another person. 


Ultimately, what I don't understand is why the undermining the rape statistics is so important for MRAs and TRPs. Is it because you don't want behaviour that you regularly engage in to be classed as rape? Are you worried about being falsely accused because you have a lot of sex with people who are drunk, don't know you very well, or might regret sleeping with you? A lot of that could be remedied by not going the PUA route, and actually having thoughtful, meaningful reciprocal relationships with female humans, rather than subbing here. But of course, if you don't believe women are capable of being your equal, then I suppose it makes sense to come here, cry AWALT, and pretend rape and privilege are not real.

1718,"This is great! I hope it goes well. I'm glad you've spent time carefully considering making this decision. 

May I ask you, are you reading anything right now relevant to discerning a call to monastic life? This decision process makes me think about my favourite poet, Gerard Manly Hopkins, when he was choosing to enter a Jesuit order. For him that involved a step in-between, of leaving the Church of England and secretly converting to Catholicism while he was at Oxford in the 1860s. He was quite young when he joined his order, scarcely out of university, and I've always thought it was a bit impulsive of him. But those first 7 years of poetic silence and service resulted in an outburst of some of the most ingenious poetry of his century and the next. 

In fact, may I leave you with one such work? This is one of the Joyful Sonnets, a loose collection of works he wrote after 1874, when he broke his silence:

&gt; Glory be to God for dappled things –

&gt; For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;

&gt; For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;

&gt; Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches’ wings;

&gt; Landscape plotted and pieced – fold, fallow, and plough;

&gt; And áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.

&gt; All things counter, original, spare, strange;

&gt; Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)

&gt; With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;

And it's in the light of complementarianism that same-sex marriage is truly, as it's core, about sex (male and female) not sexuality. Because same-sex marriage *does* significantly deviate from non-egalitarian marriage. It rejects entirely that there must be a man and his helpmeet. That one person is to lead and the other is to follow, and when both are of the same sex, there is no male to minister, or there is no female to be subordinate. Same-sex marriage, like egalitarian mixed-sex marriage, rejects this structure for marriage, just as modern western marriage has rejected many other outmoded customs and practices, such as coverture.

1766,"If you consider same-sex relations to be a ""sexual sin"" then yeah, I could see why that would be a problem for you. But did you read [the convention paper on marriage](https://extranet.generalconvention.org/staff/files/download/12485.pdf)? I think you should read it first, before you make a choice. Because if same-sex marriage boils down to nothing more than sexual sin, I think you are missing the broader rationalization for this change, and might benefit from reading some of the reasoning. 

That said - I think excommunication is a bit of a strong word here. It's not likely to happen, we're more likely to withdraw, but even if it did, I guess I don't think that's a bad thing. It's not like the communion is vested with any real spiritual authority - we are a community of equals. It would be tragic to lose this connection to our heritage and tradition, but it's not going to invalidate us as a denomination or undermine our future as a part of the Body of Christ.

I'm just asking because my entire life growing up I took these things for granted, so I'm always surprised when I meet an Episcopalian who considers this a big deal. I know they are out there but I've personally encountered very few. But since this isn't about baptism, it's not about the divinity of Christ, it's not about core doctrines of salvation, I just don't see how it's a conflict to open the doors to all practicing Episcopalians.

8 women out of 142 seats. What parity! And all 8 of those female bishops can thank TEC for the changes that made their ordination possible, a whopping 26 years after we ordained our first female bishop. All the more reason to be glad of the changes that TEC has made to reject sexism in our marriage ceremony. At this rate, if you're lucky, the CoE might do the same in another quarter of a century.

1818,"Montessori is an excellent system, and the pace of education is child-led. It's not hands-off, its teaching ndependence. Each station or work is taught to each student, 1-on-1, by one of the teachers, and the child must complete it correctly while being observed in order to be able to do it on their own. All of those other kids are working quietly by themselves because they have had private lessons on each activity. They are expected to find things to do, and work on them without prompting or supervision, complete them, clean them up, and put them away. These are self-care, self-motivation, and organization skills that most middle school students lack, and which are incredibly valuable to a young child going into Kindergarten.

They have many, many literacy works that children will work on, to learn to read and write. These are paired with tactile activities because that is how young children learn best. You may not have been exposed to any of those, but they are included in the curriculum from the start. 

I can't speak highly enough for the montessori method, honestly. It's a comprehensive, whole-child approach to teaching children how to learn, and how to pursue knowledge and achievement as ends in their own. It fosters intrinsic motivation, restraint, and time-management, things many adults fundamentally lack.

1819,"It's extremely common to lose interest in sex because of the hormonal changes and discomfort of pregnancy and early motherhood. Breast-feeding can also decrease libido. You might have to wait until she's closer to 6 months post-partum before things go back to normal. Her body literally just made a new human from scratch. Add to that the nutritional deprivation her body has been experiencing, the stress, extreme sleep-deprivaton, and emotional demands of early parenting, and it's surprising anyone is able to muster what it takes to have sex.

Please be patient with her, and don't give up! It might help to introduce the idea of intimacy without suggesting PIV at all. Maybe you can just masturbate together, or make out and see where it leads? But like I said, you will need to be patient. Yes, it's a mild inconvenience not to have sex for a few months, or even a year, but she's also just gone through the most major changes a human body and undergo, all in that same year. Give her a break.

He's probably also resistant to the amount of work required, but it would appear less daunting if all the resources were already picked out and it's just a matter of finding the information. Then again, the internet is available for exactly that. 

He's also not aurally processing the instructions from his teachers, it sounds like, so it might be helpful to him if you got a list of assignments directly from the teacher. He has a gap in skills like organization, time management, setting up sequential processes, and planning a multi-step task. These are skills he can acquire, but someone has to teach them to him. Some kids just pick up this kind of thing, others learn it in montessori preschools. Your son hasn't learned them yet, but he can! He just needs a regimented routine that clearly lays out the steps for each assignment, and breaks them down into doable parts.

In short - your son needs a tutor.

1825,"&gt; The grieving atheist cannot provide any reason why he grieves, or why he (rightly) respects the grief of others.

This makes no sense to me, at all. If anything, the person who's grief makes the least sense is the Christian, who professes to believe in life after death, making no loss of life ever permanent. Why in the world would a Christian mourn the passing of a fellow believer? Is that what they want? To go on to some bigger, better place after this one? This life that's only a dress-rehearsal?

In contrast, the atheist has experienced permanent loss. The fellow human to whom he or she was bonded emotionally and psychologically, has ceased to exist, has been utterly extinguished. He or she has much more cause for grief, surely.

&gt; Saying that life and morality and reason and virtue and emotions such as grief are physical processes — this is not the same as saying they are illusions.

Exactly. It's the opposite. Saying they are physical processes that can be explained and measured makes the more real and tangible and materially relevant than if they are ethereal and insubstantial spiritual conditions. ",2016-01-13 15:36:18+00:00,cywongy,1.0,t3_40pwg3,46887.0,atheism

And in practice, though we're open, that looks less like wildly sleeping around all the time, and more like being open to the possibility of other sexual/romantic interests if they come along. And now and then, they do!

Meanwhile, regarding your bf - being completely obsessed with work/school while you are in school, is pretty normal. Consider medical students everywhere. Making sacrifices of time, energy, and mental bandwidth in order to ensure greater future happiness is a mark of maturity, I don't think you need to worry about it too much, unless you are legitimately being neglected.

1829,"&gt; How many times has it been portrayed that PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF?

Yeah, this is a common narrative in fiction. But in reality, it doesn't actually work like that. It's extremely rare, in fact. The whole persistence narrative for romance is completely farcical. In real life, people are either attracted to eachother, or they aren't. Now and then long-term friends will become lovers, but overwhelmingly, persistence does not pay off when it comes to romance. The idea that if you keep trying, that girl next door will eventually cave and you'll get that prize, is a myth you all tell yourselves, and nothing more. 

Fear and respect are pretty close to the same thing in this context. It means you are taking the potential consequences of upsetting him seriously. Whereas a girl who has to lie to get you to leave her alone isn't getting taken seriously until she lies and can throw the weight of her imaginary boyfriend at the situation. 

Regardless- is your point is that you don't respect her telling you no, she's not interested AND you don't respect the other guy either? You respect neither person? You're just out for yourself and what you can get other people to give you? You sound like a swell guy.

This is a Catholic belief. I don't think other denominations pay much attention at all to Mary, and few are invested in her claimed ""perpetual virginity."" I see no reason to believe she remained a virgin - she was married, afterall. Besides, virginity is actually a made-up thing, it's a cultural construct. Nothing is changed or defiled. Any possible biological basis for the status of ""virgin"" (ie - an unbroken hymen) is clearly no longer applicable after giving birth anyway.

But honestly, growing up in the church, I never believed she was a virgin to begin with. The virgin birth mythology was just symbolic to me. As my 8-year old puts it: ""Mammals have to mate to reproduce, and humans are mammals, mama.""

He cuddled her afterward until she moved up to her bed, and we two slept on the floor on our sleeping bag, and then in the morning he and she played video games for like an hour.

1907,"&gt;  I've read everything I can get my hands on with respect to LDS theology

Then you should know, there is a long and proliferate history of theological debate, it's just that very, very little of it has anything to do with the texts that other Christians use and examine, namely, the OT and NT. Most of the LDS focus is, predictably, on the BOM and, perhaps moreso, the D&amp;C. Between these and the ongoing ""open canon"" of semi-annual conventions and other talks by apostles and prophets, there is a LOT of material to get through, though the caliber, content, and complexity vary tremendously.

But even if you find much of it fairly thin, the doctrines about sex and gender, and proscribed gender roles, are probably the best examined and best articulated. A justification for the male priesthood is foundational to the entire structure of the family, not just the church, because unlike the catholic church, where only some catholics are actually priests, and everyone else, male and female, is a parishioner, in the LDS church, every single adult male is ordained a priest (barring self-exclusion or disciplinary action) and wields the priesthood for his family. He administers their baby baptisms, blessings, healing, etc. It's way, way more baked into the whole world view and identity from before birth, for them. Compared to that, saying only men and not women can attend divinity school and be ordained as a career seems petty and arbitrary for many. But of course, they also ostensibly frown on ""priestcraft"" anyway..... all while paying enormous compensation to their apostles, but that's another conversation....

&gt; Ephesians 5 has nothing to do with the Church's position on an all-male priesthood. 

I said there was a justification for hierarchical marriage in Ephesians, I didn't imply that was related to the all-male priesthood directly. But the preference given to penis-havers in both readings on both issues *is* interrelated. The two are examples of a sex-based class system in the church. 

As I understand it, male priesthood has to do with the so-called apostles, and the writing of ""church fathers."" 

Regardless, I don't see how anyone could find any of it compelling, so perhaps it's just a failure of imagination on my part. Maybe someone could walk away from the LDS church and end up accepting the Catholic justification for sex-based exclusion in the clergy.

1909,"&gt; The LDS are not an overly theological bunch. There isn't a heritage of thinking about these things very deeply. 

I can name you quite a lot of Mormons and Exmos who would very strongly disagree with this statement. How much do you actually know about LDS doctrine? I would wager relatively little.

The rationale for the LDS church's stance of female ordination is compelling because it has to do with their premortal life and eternal plan for salvation. Strict sex-based division of all things is way, way more intrinsic to their plan for salvation than is it for any other Christian denomination.

The Catholic church has an elaborate justification regarding clergy specifically, sure, and there is that loose justification for hierarchical marriage based on the whole ""Christ and the Church"" metaphor (which is a remarkably unChristian passage in the text, imo) but I hardly think that would compel someone who is walking away from a belief system which dictates that you literally must be temple married to a person of the other sex just to make it to Super VIP Heaven.

Really? You've never heard a man blame his rape victim for getting him so excited that he couldn't help himself? Never ever heard a criminal blame his upbringing or bullying on his violent outlash? Because I think you need to read a little more news.

&gt; what are responsibilities? Responsibilities to women and children? Why do single men have these days?

Yeah, responsibilities to children they father, if any. But also responsibilities to actually get a job and work instead of living off of their mothers and the mothers of their children. I suppose you don't know a single man who is just couchsurfing his way through adulthood, ""borrowing"" from friends, and living at home with his parents without contributing financially? That's an unheard of phenomenon to you?

&gt; So, the ends justifies the means? Is utilitarianism the way forward?

No. I'm saying patriarchy oppresses minority men, the homeless, and drug addicts, by charging them with crimes and punishing them out of proportion, propelling them into a cycle of poverty and criminality. I'm not saying that's a good thing. I'm just acknowledging that the same patriarchy that lets some men off with a warning sends others to jail for life for minor drug offenses.

Isolating when sick or suffering is maladaptive in a communal primate species like ours, and is especially maladaptive today, when we have medical technology and psychiatric care that can resolve issues rather than leaving them to get worse and eventually kill you. 

That behaviour may have been adaptive for our distant ancestors, but it's not adaptive today. Do why do people still act this way? Because of socialization. We socialize this behaviour into men in the west, and we socialize it into women in other cultures. In India women are often expected to starve and forgo medical care while pregnant, and if they complain they are beaten. 

So sure, you might feel a twinge of inhibition at mentioning that you are sick or injured, but you can govern that tiny little impulse with the power of your rational mind. And yet you dont, because of things people have taught you.

Actually, this is false. Men who form meaningful bonds with other people are less likely to end up homeless or suffer severe mental illness without support. This makes logical sense, too. If you have a support system, you're less likely to fall through the cracks. Its is exclusively men who fail at forming and maintaining relationships with family and friends and SOs, who end up with no one to take them in.

How can you claim to know this? Seriously? Just because you all say it to yourselves over and over doesn't make it true. 

&gt; Hypergamy is about status. Men are polygamous. We don't care if a girl with big tits is the president of the free world or a Hooter's waitress.

Nope, this is utterly false. For secret sex, sure, but for a public relationship, women are 100% used as a status symbol for men. What constitutes high status for men and women is not that different, either. Wealth and appearance. 

&gt; Sex comes at the bottom of our hierachy of needs, along with shelter and food.

Orgasm is a need, and one that your body will take care of for you. Sexual intercourse with another person is not a need like shelter and food, and you will survive just fine even if no other person on the planet will ever have sex with you. However, as a mammal and a primate, you do have a need for deeply formed emotional bonds with others of your species. Something that is impossible if you assert your heteronormativity so aggressively that you can't bond with other men *and* you can't bond with women because you don't think of them as actual people. Bonding is a need. PIV is emphatically not. The drive for sex is a drive to reproduce, but it's still not a need that you must meet to survive. 

Prioritizing colonizing as many other bodies as possible with PIV over forming meaningful relationships or having a family has nothing to do with your hierarchy of needs, it has to do with simple priorities. Pleasure, status, and power is what matters most to RPers, apparently. And that's exactly why your petty alpha/beta hierarchy is as meaningless in humans as it is in chimpanzees. You will leave nothing important or lasting for the world if you seek only to meet your desires and not contribute to the well-being of others in your community. 

RP loves to talk about the ""great men"" in the history of western civilisation. There have been many, it is true.

According to whom, exactly? Besides, sexual fantasies are not relationship fantasies. It's a fantasy for a reason. 

&gt; If you want to succeed at dating

I think this is the problem here. Your definition of ""success"" is different. Do you want to have as much sex as possible with as many women as possible? Or do you want to form a long-term relationship that involves raising future humans to pass on your genes and your knowledge?

I sure hope you all are just in it for the sex. You'll all be selecting yourself out of the gene pool in your desperate attempt to have as much PIV as possible while also not having any responsibilities for offspring and definitely not getting married.

At what point in my response do I appear to be ""emotional?"" I disagree with some of the statements you have made. That's not about being ""emotional,"" that's a disagreement. 

&gt; Opinions, are to be examined and not a instrument to stress your day :). 

What are you even talking about? I'm not stressed. I'm a little surprised and astounded, but I'm not stressed out that you, some random person with problems, has an opinion. I just disagree, and am voicing it. 

&gt; But if you was looking at the news and was shown a study about female depression link to masturbating, by a so called scientist who just study a few chicks, it would probably be your next post on reddit.

I would be interested in such a study, if it was peer reviewed and well constructed. But I'm not refuting the possibility that such research exists, I'm merely questioning the idea that you are perpetually seeing women with blank stares, and then extrapolating from that something completely unrelated and probably quite unusual. Excessive or compulsive masturbation can be detrimental to some people, though demonstrably way more so for males than females. Masturbation is perfectly functional adaptation for most people.

I think unless you are a women, you probably have little understanding of how untrue this statement is, especially for young people. Male masturbation is normalized in our culture. Female masturbation is no where near as normalized, and is highly fetishized and commercialized.

2080,"We're non-monogamous. We (F/29 and M/27) sometimes use the term ""poly"" casually, but we don't think it actually fits us. 

We are decidedly non-monogamous though. That was the deal from the beginning. I've been in open relationships before and I generally prefer it. Because you never know when some old affair will blow through town, and it seems like an arbitrary boundary to set to require people to be completely monogamous all the time.

Because of where I am right now in my life and the development of my sexuality, I don't really see other people much. The majority of my time and energy go into my primary relationship, my child, and my work. I am happy this way. I have found that I need to be rather emotionally attached to someone before I can enjoy sex with them, and I just don't have the bandwidth for anyone additional right now.

My partner does sleep with other people. He grew up a conservative christian and he's cutting loose and living now. He's got a boyfriend whom he sees at least twice a month, on average. He also has 3 girls in his life that he sees now and then, though less frequently. One is married, and I've met her and her husband, both very nice. One is a student, I think, whom he has seen only 3 times in the last year. I think they've been out for karoke. One lives in another city but is coming up in January to spend a weekend with him. There is also another guy whom he's seen a few times, but I think they've only hung out and maybe cuddled? 

Those dates with other people make up a small fraction of the time I get with him. 

I don't harbour any resentment over his escapades at all. I'm happy for him to go out and sleep with people. I get a little insecure now and then, but it's usually easily cured. The truth is, I get so much out of our relationship, that I can't possibly feel deprived if now and then he's not available for me. We spend so much time together, and we have a really great sex life. Plus, I legitimately find him more sexually attractive when he's been with someone else. And we both want each other more when we've been around other people. It helps us appreciate the special connection we have. 


I will say, though, that if our relationship wasn't as strong as it is, and if he wasn't such a reliable and ethical feminist, I probably wouldn't be having as great of an experience.

Edit: I should note, though, that's we've closed the relationship at different times, including right after we got serious. We both just really wanted exclusivity for a while, because it was new and terrifying and intense and we just didn't want to be with anyone else. And we plan to close it again if I get pregnant, because hormones. So it's not like there is no room for temporary monogamy in our lives.

2082,"&gt; But how do you suppose I will ever make my bond stronger with someone who doesn't even want to engage with me?

The short answer is you cant. You can't force a closer relationship with someone else if they don't want one. Relationships must go two-ways, and if your cousin doesn't want to be closer friends, then you'll have to respect that boundary. 

&gt; Should I be content with her spending time with me according to her convenience but I am always available when she wants? 

Basically, yes. She's your cousin, so you can't really stop knowing her. But even if she wasn't your cousin, it would be odd to cut someone out just because they don't want to be your best friend. Friendships are tricky, and they require both people to be engaged. Sometimes one person is more into it than the other person. But being a good friend means respecting each other and accepting what they can give you, even if it's less than what you want or are able to give. You don't have to always be available to her, though. But if you genuinely like her and want to get to know her better, than what can it hurt, to be available when she is? Maybe over time, she will warm up. 

&gt; Do you not think I would feel unfair about it?

I'm going to say it again because I don't think it sank in last time, but you are actually not entitled to any of her attention, beyond common politeness. She's her own person, she has the right to choose not to engage with you, even if you want her to. If feels unfair to you because it seems like you aren't getting what you feel like you deserve. But it's not a question of fairness or deserving. She's a separate person from you. You aren't in a relationship, you haven't committed to each other, you are just cousins. If she doesn't want any more closeness, then you have to learn to be ok with that. Her decisions are not about you, they are about her.

2097,"Your race-track example is ludicrous, as there is no reason or benefit for you to drive your car on a racetrack. There are myriad reasons why adults, in the privacy of their own homes, choose to have sex with their partners. The idea that we would moralize about that or seek to interfere in the private sex lives of private individuals is absurd and orwellian.

The simple car driving part of your example isn't bad, though, in that you are right, we do need to drive cars, even though there is the risk that we might die. Lots of risk, actually. So we get insurance, and we abide by laws, and be live with the potential risk that something might go wrong. Because that's how adult life works. 

No amount of birth control can protect against pregnancy 100% of the time. Unplanned pregnancies still occur. In the US, they currently account for 50% of pregnancies. It should be way, way lower, but eliminating it is impossible. 

Nor is all sex that results in pregnancy consensual. Nor is it always possible to access better forms of BC - if your employer chooses not to cover it, or your state medicaid chooses to exclude it, options like IUDs are generally too expensive to get. 

Obviously birth control is one way to tackle the issue, but it doesn't actually remove the necessity for legal, easily accessible abortion. 

Besides, not all abortions are the result of unplanned pregnancy, anyway. Fetal abnomality or fatal fetal complications, complications that risk the health and/or life of the mother, changing personal and financial circumstances, many things can contribute to the decision to terminate a pregnancy, even if the pregnancy was planned.

Women are fully capable moral and intellectual agents who have the right to make private medical decisions about their bodies and lives in the privacy of an office visit with their doctor, without overreaching government interference.

Just to take some ulcer medication to start a period. 

The difference between how it used to be, and how it is now, is quite extreme. On the scale of legal-and-easily-accessible/affordable and illegal, the current situation is much, much closer to illegal.",2015-12-15 20:58:48+00:00,cy06osd,5.0,t1_cy05kof,1520.0,politics

2116,"Yes, all of those hurdles might have been overcome if you are desperate enough and take enough risks and the situation aligns for you. For more then 60% of women who have abortions, you would also need to arrange for childcare, since they already have one or more children. So sure, maybe she could have had all the stars align AND the facility could fit her in. Payment plans are not a thing in abortion care, for the majority of facilities, though, btw. And besides, a payment plan assumes income. What if you have none because you are a full time college student or caring for a baby at home?

So yeah, maybe she could have done all of those things and managed to get there and have the abortion legally in under the time frame. But she couldn't manage it. And many, many other people can't, either. Because poverty, stress, and simply the misery of actually being pregnant are a pretty big barrier to taking any kind of action until it's too late. Its easy for you to imagine what you would do. But until you are in that position, you just don't know.


But why does it need to be that difficult in the first place? It doesn't. Until recently, you used to just be able to go to the office, have a chat, take a pill, and go home. All in one visit. It's not a big deal. It's not dangerous or complicated. You could in theory skip the office visit and do it via telemedicine. 


So then why would we want to make sure only the richest and most organized/on top of it women can access abortion, but the poorest, least competent, least organized, most stressed are not able to. Its basically guaranteeing the highest possible amount of suffering for the least among us. ",2015-12-15 20:19:30+00:00,cy04yh9,7.0,t1_cy04htp,627.0,politics

Can't afford the appointment to see if you are pregnant. Can't afford the multiple visits to finally get the abortion. And by then it's too late for just the pills, you have to have the procedure.

A procedure which, despite ALL those ridiculous hurdles, is actually perfectly simple and takes approximately 7 minutes. Its the smallest thing. It takes longer to remove and replace an IUD, for many patients.

It sounds like you are wanting a much higher level of engagement with her than she wants. She clearly just wants to be alone. What you are calling ""silent treatment"" is not any kind of punishment to her, she's probably relieved that you are leaving her alone. Her time belongs to her, she doesn't have time to read your articles, and it's probably ok that she chooses not to. You need to meet her where she is. And if that's just occasional friendly conversation now and then, then that's going to have to be enough for you.

Is that what you really believe? You don't think that its possible to perceive animosity and aggression without raising your voice? 

As I've already said, I think the disconnect here is one of vocabulary. Instead of ""yelling"" it would be more accurate to say you are scorning, criticizing, scolding, or being aggressive or harsh.

The verb ""to yell at"" someone, [encompasses more than volume](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/yell%20at).

If, for you, ""yelling at"" someone can only ever mean raising your volume, and you can't possible conceive of how any person could possibly use that term to mean more than just that one measure, then you are probably always going to have this same misunderstanding with other people who are using the term differently.

And that process of socialization expands small biological differences and cements gendered roles through neuroplasticity. Yes.

Preexisting differences in the starting conditions are a matter of sex, not gender. Gender is imposed and performed, it's not biologically predetermined, and it varies vastly between cultures and throughout history because, again, it's the result of a dynamic process.

Arguably, having an overwhelming preference for the way one's brain functions under a male hormone cocktail vs a female hormone cocktail might be a reasonable way to describe or explain trans-identity, and certainly justifies medical intervention. As I've said, I have no problem with medical care the relieves suffering and improves quality of life. 

Nor do I accuse all trans-people of either policing gender conformity or perpetuating those stereotypes (though I charge that many absolutely do).

That doesn't change the fact that claiming that gender non-conforming traits, preferences, or behaviours are pathological is a problem for everyone. Nor does it alter the socialization men and women grow up with as a result of their assigned sex prior to their transition. Nor does any of it justify the erasure of sex in favour of ""gender identity"" in all things.

Sex is real. Gender is a social construct. 

It's possible to empathize with trans people and advocate for their access to healthcare and appropriate accommodations while still acknowledging that sex exists. A transwoman can be a woman, sure, because ""woman"" is socially constructed. But she is not female because ""female"" is defined by several different, occasionally conflicting, but nevertheless biologically concrete measures. 

And it matters that sex is real because we live in a sex-based class system, in which people are assigned a gender based on their assigned sex, and those gender boundaries are enforced and reinforced in our culture. To erase sex denies patriarchy.

Over time, the vast majority of patients (95%+) go on to feel that it was the right decision, and to be glad they made it.

I think you might benefit from a little cognitive behavioural therapy. If you know, rationally, that you made the best choice, but still *feel* conflicted, that's ok. You can have those thoughts and feelings, acknowledge them, and then just let them go. They are no longer serving you any more. You don't need them. You can recognize them without believing that it's real or true. It's just a thought, it's just a feeling.

2239,"&gt; There's a difference between gender identity, gender expression, and gender roles. 

I think the problem is with the use of the term ""gender"" and the idea of an innate ""gender identity."" At most we could probably meet in the middle if we called that ""sexual identity."" The brain's idea of what sex it's body is or should be. But that doesn't change the fact that claiming someone has a ""girl"" or ""boy"" brain when those two categories do not exist in any meaningful way, is highly problematic. To then conflate biological sex with gender in the form of an inborn ""gender identity"" is then additionally problematic. 

&gt; She's a woman because she identifies as one, because her mental body map is wired for a different body.

This is a difficult claim to support in the literature, but is also not generally the claim made. The brain *is* the body, it's all part of the same system. Unless someone has a non-functioning penis that is utterly disconnected to their brains, they are ""wired"" to that penis just like every other person with a penis is. Afterall, the penis and the clitoris are so analogous that they are functionally indistinguishable well into gestation. It's the exact same wiring. 

The only thing we can really say is that brains are a mosaic of attributes, some of which are more common in one sex than the other, and that people with gender dysphoria tend to have some traits that are more common in a sex other than theirs. Sure. No problem. If we didn't enforce gender-conformity, maybe some of those people could be perfectly happy being whoever they are in the body they currently have. But if its so painful to live like that, then sure, get medical care for it. 

As long as no one is being harmed I see little problem with medical care to relieve suffering.

Its not the private medical decisions of private individuals that concerns me, it's mostly the appalling, misogynistic, and reductive sex-based generalizations used to explain and justify those medical treatments and other accommodations, that consistently reinforce socially constructed gender binary and that contribute to a climate where gender essentialism has seen a powerful resurgence.

That doesnt mean that the trend toward greater division is not still something to talk about! No one is talking about regulating toy companies. The effects can still be observed, measured, and evaluated. 

&gt; I have a 2 and a half year old nephew who doesn't give a fuck what he plays with.

Great sample size! 

&gt; It's clear that you've already decided what your stance is going to be, and regardless of the studies and evidence contrary to what you think, you'll defend it endlessly. I'm not going to sit here and link a thousand studies, because you can do the research yourself if you actually care. But the research has been done, and we already know that toy choices made by children are mostly instinctual and biological.

Studies that exist indicate there is some gender difference in some kinds of toy selection, sure. Baby dolls are particularly attractive to female primates of all kinds, for example. But whereas gender-neutral marketing does not in any way dampen a biological instinct, gendered marketing does for every child whose gender-mosaic brain (and that's every single child) has preferences that vary.

Human behaviour is not biologically deterministic because our brains are plastic. Mild differing inclinations can easily become deeply exaggerated gaps in development. Moreover, continuing to gender toys for which there is zero research to suggest any kind of sex-based selection (like kitchen sets, or the colour blue) constructs a whole complex of ""girl"" and ""boy"" toys and activities which contribute to the social construct of gender. 

Sex is real. Gender is a social construct. 

So a female primate playing a baby doll is about her female sex. Extending that preference to marketing kitchen sets, brooms and mops, aprons, tea sets, all manner of domestic doll re-enactment equipment to girls, and defending it based on a biological inclination toward infants is just an exercise in justifying the culturally constructed role of ""woman"" by pointing at biology. There is nothing biological about liking tea parties.

Also, there is definitely a higher likelihood of female primates of all kinds to play with baby dolls, which also makes sense. Boys, on the other hand, prefer other kinds of dolls.

But that doesn't account for the colour-coding, or the myriad other examples of gender-coded activities. 

That said, the idea that other primates are immune to cultural influences is belied by other research on baboons and bonobos, for example.

None of this speaks to the problematic nature of binary toy and activity designations for human primates, who are vastly more neurologically complex and whose plastic brains are easily altered by lived experience, and whose brains cannot be meaningfully categorized as male or female.

I also don't have a problem asking people to help walk me out to my car if its late. I won't ever ask a man who's on his own, but if he's part of a mixed-sex couple, or if he works at the location, I will ask for help sometimes, if there are sketchy people around the door or if I parked especially far away.

As a rule, though, I don't go out of the house after dark by myself for really any reason, unless it's to run an errand in a clearly lighted public place.

2311,"&gt; I'm 26 and AMAB

Nice to meet you.

&gt; I was (or thought I was) a straight boy when I was younger (let's say until 11 with no contradiction, and a few extra years of obviliousness)

Not unusual.

&gt; I fantasizes about being a woman (lesbian specifically) at night when I was 10-11

Autogynephilia is quite common and nothing to worry about. I fantasize about being a guy, but that doesn't mean I want to be one. 

&gt; my first couple of wet dreams involved sucking on penises or making out with a naked guy (but a couple of others involved women)

So you like men too. Cool!

&gt; I cross dressed when I was 13 (and tried again last year)

This is a very common sexual fetish that many people enjoy. It's also just fun to cross boundaries. Also doesn't mean anything about your identity, necessarily. 

&gt; when I was 15, I freaked out about being - or perceiving myself as - gay (I didn't factor gender identity into it then, but cis gay guy specifically)

Understandable. People freak out when finding they belong to a sexual minority.

&gt; I developed a thing for playing as women in games (at first just lesbians, but later any orientation)

Also very common, and not neccessarily indicative of anything underlying. My bf almost only plays as women, and I almost only play as men. That's the whole point of role-playing! It's to be someone else. 

&gt; (I'm sorry if this disgusts or offends any trans women out there) I got into porn involving trans women and cross dressing/feminine men

Not unexpected, considering the crossdressing and autogynephilia. 

&gt; I had a crush on my (male) friend in my first year of college

Cool!

&gt; I wanted to be trans for a bit four years ago, but felt cis and like I couldn't be (and that the desire was born out of internalized homophobia)

Perceiving that your assigned sex does not match some core inner identity or perception of yourself is different from ""wanting to be trans."" I think internalized homophobia is probably a pretty reasonable cause for some of that, but only you can know. 

&gt; A couple of years I became friends with a lesbian I developed a huge crush on

Not unexpected, since you used to like women, like to imagine yourself as one when masturbating (which, again, is quite common among cis straight men, even) and especially if her gender performance is attractive to you as a man who likes men. Also maybe because she's not available to you, because she's a lesbian. That probably adds to the attractiveness.

&gt; ast year, I tried giving into being a cis gay guy. It was alright, but didn't quite fit. Then I found out I'm still attracted to (cis) women too.

Sounds like you are bisexual! Come hang out at r/bisexual. 

&gt; I get jealous at pictures of lesbian weddings with both of them in bridal dresses :(

I get jealous of penises, too. And lesbians. And many many people. If I could be born again it would be as a gay man. That still doesn't mean there is anything underlying this apart from the existential angst of being alive and only being able to experience life from one perspective. That doesn't make it clinical. 

&gt; last week, my therapist and I had come to the conclusion that while we're still working on the gender stuff, I'm pansexual.

Good for you! Congrats!

&gt; lately, I've been oscillating between feeling/being trans (and anxious) or cis (and really sad). I don't like how masculine my body is, but keep having something say to me that that's a lie, and I'm cis

Being uncomfortable in your own body is not uncommon. Indeed, I would argue that most people are not fully comfortable in their bodies. That doesn't mean you need to alter it. Your ambivalence suggests that there is hope for integration and self-acceptance. I think that's worth pursuing.

2366,"&gt; Only the patriarch leads. That doesn't mean only the patriarch wins. 

This is a laughable comparison. A hunter-gatherer example would make more sense if the leader then also reserved 90% of the kill for him and his buddy, and everyone else had to parcel out what was left.

And anyway, contemporary theory in organizational dynamics utterly contradicts the need for a leader, at all. There is no need for an embodied leader to lead a group. There is only the need for a leadership function, that function can be served by consensus, by adherence to a founding document, by adaptation of a protocol, or by majority vote. As long as the leadership function is met, there is no need for any person to actual embody a leader.

This is also evidenced by contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, which have no leadership structure, no chief, no priesthood class. Only elders with opinions, and young people who decide for themselves what to do, and group enforcement against domestic violence and rape because everyone can see and hear everything, and there are no doors or locks, and no privacy with which to hide it. The !Kung are probably the best example of this. You should read Marjorie Shostak's work, you would learn a lot about human behaviour in a society that is actually egalitarian. There is some division of labour between the sexes, but there is no permanent marriage, no obsession with paternity, no obsession with virginity. Boys and girls choose sexual partners at will, marriages dissolve at will, there is no child custody. Males and females are treated as biologically different and still basically the same. That's what actual egalitarianism is.

&gt; Do you think we're so different from chimpanzees that we immediately eschewed any hierarchy, then reformed it starting with the Egyptians? Or is chimpanzee research just more ""by-men-for-men"" conspiracy?

Well, of course, the evolutionary line the broke off from our common ancestor with chimps did so over 4 millions years ago, so we were never chimps because chimps never existed until recently. That said, you might enjoy learning more about chimpanzee organization. The male hierarchy is very volatile, yes, but it does not result in improved mating advantage for alpha chimps. The female hierarchy, on the other hand, is stable. Males cycles in and out, commit violence against each other and females, and eventually are kicked out again. They are only passing through the colony, which consists of a stable, permanent group of females. Males, on the other hand, are interchangeable and impermanent, and that includes the alpha male. Females, meanwhile, actively subvert the male hierarchy by preferentially mating with so-called beta males because they make for better mates, sneaking off into the woods to avoid the violent alphas. Its all in the DNA. So, yeah, early primatology, practices mostly by men in the 19th and early 20th century, utterly failed to document any of that. It wasn't until the 50s and 60s that we had more female anthropologists out there, and learned a lot more about our nearest living cousins.


&gt; Not a single one of those is actually exclusive to men, and domestic violence has been a two-way street since we began keeping history of it. At this point you're just trying to paint emotive topics as female subjugation.

It was the introduction of static dwellings and property rights, (which were absolutely exclusive to males when instated), that precipitated the rise of patriarchy. There is nothing controversial about that statement, and we can observe it happening in newly settled hunter-gatherer societies today. And while domestic violence occurs in both men and women, men are vastly more prolific. While male and female victims both exist, MOST male victims of domestic violence are abused by other men (brothers, fathers, etc). Most male rape victims are also raped by other men. Men are still acting out the most violence against each other and against women. So you're right, there are some ways in which we are still quite similar to earlier hominids and other primates.

2368,"&gt; The dictionary disagrees.

Lol. You do realize that people write dictionaries, right? People who grow up in patriarchy. We could just as easily set a different measure for ""emotional maturity,"" such as being able to identify and name your own feelings, and those of others, something that women generally manage to do better than men. 

&gt; Show me a society where not only do men openly cry. But where they openly do so more often than women do so.

Why should we pursue ""more"" and not just ""the same?"" Regardless, the question isn't whether there is a current society that has socialized men this way, it's that it's perfectly possible, and that's evidenced by [other cultures where the gap is much, much narrower.](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/02/cry.aspx)

So sure, hormonal differences in the body may affect the propensity for tears in women more than men, but when you close the gap produced by socialization, the difference isn't that significant.

Regardless, how is crying a problem? How exactly does briefly crying in response to something then go on to disrupt ones ability to think rationally, to make executive decisions, or to experience, express, and empathize with complex emotions in your own and other's lives? Its doesn't. Not at all. I fail to see how this is relevant to maturity and functional adulthood.

Men, on the other hand, again thanks to those hormones, do also explode in emotional outbursts quite frequently. But instead of crying when they are angry (an emotion expressed in tears in women) they act out violently: hitting, punching, kicking, biting, raping, and murdering people. Most of those are emotional outbursts, not premeditated acts. I suppose you could also attribute rape to lust, another emotion. And theft and similar crimes more common among men, to greed. There are all kinds of emotions manifesting in violence and antisocial behaviour among men. I might be inclined to attribute some of that to the disempowerment of impoverished or minority men under patriarchy, but hey, you're all about biological determinism around here. 

So, if my hormones cause me to cry when I'm confronted with a obstacle, and once that passes I govern myself and go on to resolve the issue without violence, and your hormones cause you to beat someone, who is really governing their emotions and acting rationally for the better interest of themselves *and others*?

2373,"Patriarchy is an oligarchical system, yes. And yes, wealth and power continues to be concentrated in men at the very top, and that is not an accident, that is by design, as it has been for centuries. Men enrich themselves. Men oppress women and other men. The fact that there are some wealthy women who are complicit in this oppression does not undermine the reality that patriarchy disadvantages most women and many men. 

Who do you think sends all those ""disposable males"" off to die in wars? Not women. Men. Men in power choose who lives and who dies. Men in power choose to enrich themselves on the backs of the working poor and over the dead bodies of soldiers fighting wars that fill their corporate coffers.

So yes, since the womens rights movement, there are some ways in which women can escape that oppression - like the prevalence of women's shelters over men's shelters. That's a problem. But we do still live in a society with 4 times the number of animal shelters than people shelters.

Homelessness is an interesting problem, though, because the causes of homelessness in women and men are different. Women with children tend to be homeless because of family circumstances, abuse, and drug/alcohol dependence. Men are homeless for those reasons too, but also have a vastly higher rate of severe mental illness, which renders them harder to house in the long term (they refuse to stay, choosing to live on the street rather than comply with housing rules) and they are treatment resistant, rendering them often a significant risk to others in the housing set up. A more robust network of state and federally funded mental health hospitals and out patient clinics, and transitional housing for the mentally ill and for addicts would do A LOT to alleviate the homeless crisis. But that would require political will. 

And who is in charge of the government? Mostly men. Men decide to defund hospitals, to shutter clinics. Men are decided to [literally put psych patients on a bus and send them out of state rather than fund mental healthcare resources](http://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/nevada-patient-busing/article2577189.html).

A system in which women are party to the wealth and power of the government and industry results in more egalitarian laws and policies, and benefits both men and women, as evidenced by other nations with a more even distribution. 

Why? You tell me. I don't know why men choose to enrich themselves to the expense of others, and women, when represented close to parity, invest in education, childcare, social welfare, healthcare, and other programs that benefit families, children, and minority/impoverished men. Both seem rational, depending on what matters more to you. If self-interest is your driving force, then of course you would enrich yourself. If improving the conditions for others matters more to you, then you will pursue justice and well-being for others.

2375,"&gt; Menstruation is not even close to being this horrible bane you make it out to be.

You're making this assertion based on what, exactly? Your infinite experience? You realize its not just bleeding, right? The entire uterus is convulsing to expel its lining, causing severe pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and horrible gastrointestinal disturbances. Most women who are on BC are on it to control periods. And it happens every month starting at age 10. The idea that you would compare complaining about sexual arousal to complaining about debilitating pain is absurd. 

&gt; Men have to worry about that too, the only difference is that women actually get to have reproductive rights before, during and after gestation.

You're joking, right? You're comparing not getting to decide what another person does with their pregnancy to actually having a foreign entity growing inside of your and sucking your bodily resources out of you? You're comparing that to childbirth? That's a joke. Your sense of entitlement is astounding. Why should you have any decision to make at all regarding someone else's pregnancy?

&gt; Women get to choose, and society(or the government) will support and provide for them either way.

Oh yeah, that's why poverty and unemployment are exclusively male phenomena, right?

&gt; I mean, not only are they also completely provided for by the government(not even including maternity leave)

Um.... first of all, there is no mandated maternity leave in the US, so at least for those women, that's actually not really available and certainly isn't government funded or even mandated. Second of all - who, exactly, do you think is paying for the cost of having a child? Because unless you are on medicaid, no one else is covering those costs but the mother. 

&gt; Nobody forces them to do any of that, at the very least not any more than they would of men.

And that right there is the difference between the way men operate in the world, and the way women do. You red pillers just love to go on about how morally superior you are to women. But who is doing the daily, miserably, thankless work of raising children, caring for the sick, caring for the elderly? Who is doing to toiling emotional and physical labour of actually holding our society together and caring for those in need? Not men; women. And not because we have to, but because *someone* has to. 

You can take your self-pitying, whiney entitlement and fuck off yourself. And when you are an old, decrepit man, I just hope you have made enough money in your life that you can pay someone to wipe your ass for you. And chances are she'll be a woman.

Child support payments are based on income earned - if you are making minimum wage, its closer to $200 a month, which is not even enough to feed a child, much less clothe and house them and pay for childcare. The cost of childcare alone is approximately the cost of rent in most places, if not more. So if you could afford $500 plus a double rent payment on one income, you are exceptionally rare.

Regardless, socializing men to repress their feelings and encouraging women to express them, starting when they are toddlers, has a profound effect on outward affect and emotional awareness. 

None of which, however, impedes the cognitive function of rational decision-making. This is a skill that is learned, not inborn, and equally possible for both sexes. ",2015-12-02 04:10:37+00:00,cxk0u7d,2.0,t1_cxhxugg,133113.0,PurplePillDebate

2419,"Why would any person not consider earning potential a factor when selecting a mate?

I mean I'm not selecting for earning potential to the exclusion of other categories, but being able to support at least 50% of our expenses so that we can have a nice life and raise children is pretty essential because I want a nice life and I want to raise a family. 

The fact that many men in our parents generation did not select a partner who could also provide income has partly fueled the collapse of the middle class, because it is currently impossible for the vast majority of families to get by on one income, because of many, many things. So both sexes selecting for current or future earning potential seems perfectly rational.

The fact that people with greater wealth are advantaged in partnership selection over people with less wealth, all other things being equal, doesn't seem like the real problem here. And I don't think it would do anything, AT ALL, to change the status quo of sex-based income inequality. 

So again, we're down to ""For some men, a desire for sexual partners may motivate them to pursue higher-paying careers to a greater degree than the desire for sex motivates women to pursue higher-paying careers.""

And I can say, ""For some women, the necessity to support a family may motivate them to pursue higher-paying careers to a greater degree than the necessity to support a family motivates men to pursue a higher-paying careers.""

And both are valid, not mutually exclusive, and not able to explain the wage gap, so your prescription to solve this problem (women not selecting for fiscally sound partners) is moot. Because, again, all other things are not equal.

That's also a rational statement and is also irrelevant to reality because all either of those statement do is identify one single factor that may influence one sex over the other, but we can't extrapolate from their any degree of significance of this factor. 

All other things are not equal, so it's not something you can actually evaluate.

Moving on:

&gt; if people are equally motivated to work for 5 different reasons, and there is a 6th reason that differs between the two then that 6th difference explains the motivation gap between the two

That, right there, is the leap I'm talking about.

Sorry, this is incredibly weak. You are suggesting that this one extra thing - the fact that having greater wealth makes you a more viable option for a long term partner, resulting, in theory, in more access to sex - is a deciding or influential to the exclusion of any other motivations other men or women have for their career ambitions. 

It's not unreasonable to say that this factor *may* increase motivation to work for *some* men more than other men, depending on their current access to sex. It's even reasonable to say that sex is a more powerful motivator for men than for women. But it's not logical to extrapolate that therefore, men will work harder than women at a given job, or on their careers as a whole.

So that recognizing that the catholic church (or LDS church, for another similar example) has and continues to perpetrate abuse and seek enrichment, then it becomes blatantly obvious that the whole underlying religion is clearly written and edited and interpreted for the purpose of control. The catholic church chose what went in or out of the bible, based on what served them. Why should we take any of the new testament (all of which was written by people who never met Jesus, lived a generation or more later, and all pf which contain blatant fabrication and magical realism) that seriously. 

And then you step back and realize that every single religion exists to hold certain people in power over others, and all were made up to explain basic questions about life and death, and all are simply cultural constructs, so why wouldn't christianity be, also? What makes it special?

And that, is where people split off. Some people think christianity is special, and others simply don't.

2491,"&gt; violates my pride

I think, if your sexuality wasn't so linked to your pride, you'd have an easier time of it. But I know that's not really something you can control. 

&gt; This almost makes me feel as if I'm a eunuch in a Harem full of sexually active young women.

I think you are vastly overestimating how much sex everyone else is having, or even wants to have, or how much of that would come up in conversation on a regular basis. But idk. I suppose it depends on the kind of girls you're around.

&gt; May I ask: what gives you as a women the impression that men tend to suffer more from that than women? Just curious. Is that due to your experience with your platonic male friends?

What does my being female have to do with my ability to observe, reason, and empathize about a phenomenon that's happening to other people? Besides, I gave you my specific reasons already - women have some advantages because we are socialized for greater intimacy in our homosocial (same-sex) friendships. It doesn't take a genius to see that men suffer for the lack of intimacy. [This study](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/01/straight-men-cuddle-guys-study_n_5241953.html) in the UK showed how beneficial changing cultural norms have been to mitigating that stress, by allowing men to be physically affectionate without feeling like it ""compromises their masculinity"" or heterosexuality. So there is hope that this will change. Patriarchal norms require men to be utterly emotionless, stalwart, and unshakeable it isolation. But since men are people, clearly this is an absurd standard no one can possibly meet, and if they did, who would want to be around them, anyway.

But yeah, having male friends (some platonic, but many lovers or former lovers) demonstrates that to me quite viscerally. My own partner has said many times how utterly isolating it can be, especially if you are in a relationship but not having sex. There is no one you can talk to. Even other men will not sympathize. And I know the pain and isolation of a sexless marriage as well as anyone. It's the worst.

Anyway, I hope you do end up finding someone who will be a great friend to you. And who also wants to bone. lol.

&gt; I just can't communicate the female way all the time 

I'm really not sure what the ""female way"" of communicating is, but maybe that's why I have more guys friends! Lol. 

&gt; I also don't like to be the male best friend of women

I think this position is unfairly maligned, tbh. Sure, it could be burdensome to you as to anyone, to be the single friend when your close friend is in a couple. That's not really a gendered thing. It's just hard to feel like a 3rd wheel. But having friends who are women, even if it comes with a lot of unrequited desire, helps you be better at communicating with other women, introduces you to other women, and can help you find a girlfriend who might share your interests. 

It's hard to be alone, though. I think it's especially, possibly uniquely, hard on men. Women tend to have more robust emotional and social support systems. I am not one of those women, which is why I almost always have a boyfriend and a lover. But many women are just fine with only their friends, at least for a time. I think lonliness for men in our culture is acutely difficult. It's so hard to be isolated from intimacy with others. Which is why I come back to saying that the intimacy of friendships with women might actually save you until you are able to find a partner.

I'll admit, I've only skimmed the comments, but I'm still going to bring up the nuclear option because it doesn't seem like anyone has, so far:


But here's the thing - you don't actually have to keep this child. Yeah, you gave birth to her, and that's on you. But you can give her up for adoption. If you use an agency, and can prove that you haven't abused her and she hasn't been exposed to drugs, you may well find a nice family who would be interested in taking a toddler. I work with a woman who adopted a 2 year old from someone who just simply couldn't handle it anymore. She was miserable, she was on her own, and she couldn't afford the kid and didn't want him. My colleague adopted him and he's doing really well now. He's 8, has a large family, is much happier than he would have been with a mother who doesn't want him.

This might seem drastic, but that actually is an option. You can actually choose to put your child up for adoption, dump your partner or not, move across the country (or the world!), and start again. Its extreme, that's why I'm calling it the nuclear option. But it's an option, and it might even be the best for your kid, if you are going to be miserable and resentful the whole time. 



Now, chances are you won't opt for this. However, you need to know that this is an option, so that if you choose to keep the kid, it's because you are choosing to, not because it's the only choice you have. It isn't. You have a choice. 


Chances are you will opt not to adopt out at this point. Which means you need to rein in your budget so that you can afford daycare so that you can go to work. Your husband is being reckless and irresponsible with his spending. Possibly you are as well. You two are adults, you need to sit down and make a budget and stick to it, and plan to have the room in your expenses for a second rent payment each month, approximately, as that is about the cost of childcare. 

Trust me, if you hate being stuck at home, you will love working again, and it may actually make you look forward to being around your kid. Or at least you will tolerate it better.

Whatever you do, DO NOT have more kids. It does not get easier with more. Not everyone is cut out to be a parent, and some people who are still hate it. You're not alone. But you basically only have three options here:

* Wait it out and be miserable

* Change your lifestyle and find the money for childcare so you can work

* Choose adoption and give up on parenting entirely

That said - life is short and missions are actually dangerous, if you don't have access to medical treatment and something serious happens.

Regardless, having kids isn't a death sentence. Sure, the early years are busy, but as they get older you have a lot more bandwidth to work on other things. The human lifespan is long. And anyway, the idea that it's all or nothing - that unless you are 100% focused on improving the human condition, then you might as well not bother - is also absurd and impractical. 

I think you've really bought into the narrative and false dichotomies that are invented by the church. Think it through rationally - why would celibacy even lead to a positive outcomes in the first place? We've seen for literally centuries how abusive the monastic system is, and how poorly people cope with repressed sexuality, and how perverse and misguided the church is at dealing with sexual offenders, sexuality issues, pretty much anything to do with sex. 

So sure, the catholic narrative is that through celibacy you can become holy and commit your life to service. But in practice, that's not actually how it works. People with partners and families can still devote themselves to service of others (as evidenced by the myriad protestant and EO priests who are living healthier, happier, more productive lives with partners while still serving as clergy). 

If celibacy appeals to you, personally, well, then, choose celibacy. There are monks in many different religious traditions who aspire to this.

I'm not sure what I would need to be redeemed for by it, but I do know that the church has a lot to be redeemed for, and since ""purity"" doctrine is not at all unique to the catholic church, it seems like we'd be giving them a lot of credit for something plenty of other denominations also do. 

Honestly, though, I just don't really see how Jesus had that much of an opinion about people's sex lives. He talks a little bit about marriage, but I've always thought that was much less prescriptive or exclusive than people keep insisting. I also don't think the whole ""looking at someone with lust = adultery"" statement is supposed to mean that lust = adultery, I think it's an attempt to expose how arbitrarily drawn the lines of spiritually criminal behaviour so obsessively dictated and monitored by the pharisees. That just seems like a commentary on Pharisaical law, not a prescription for how we should all be living all the time.

So you think celibacy, of all things, is core to Christ's message? I think helping the poor, the weak, and the suffering, service to others, and trying to build the kingdom of heaven on earth seem like the core message. 

I never understood the obsession with sexual purity in Christianity. ",2015-11-24 17:41:23+00:00,cxbl42d,3.0,t1_cxbjx22,1720.0,excatholic

2607,"In my defense, your question was ""how did you come to that conclusion"" which sounds like you are asking for reasoning, not methodology. I don't really understand how my particular process is remotely relevant, tbh. But sure.

I'm an anthropologist by training, so I have spend a lot of my time reading about human evolution, and relationship between culture, behaviour, and neurology.

I first started experimenting with defending this idea when I was in undergrad. Cultural relativism, while essential for field work, is problematic to me, ethically. Slavery, marital rape, genital mutilation - these are not ok just because a given culture says it's ok. It's still wrong. But why? The edict to do no harm is certainly appealing, but still leads to the same question: why not? What makes it wrong to harm someone else? Where is that rule written in the fabric of the material universe? Certainly we can't make a case from nature, as you say, since violence is naturally occurring. And there is not God to dictate that it's wrong to harm others.

In the intervening years I've refined my thinking some through reading and conversation with others. That's really it. 

My concern for our survival is about the survival of life, and particularly intelligent life (Which includes not just primates but many other species. Even cephalopods, the earliest animals to evolve intelligence, long before vertebrates). It seems to me that this is the only reasonable objective measure or goal. This specific concern became more palpable for me the first time I was exposed to the idea of the Fermi Paradox and the possibility of a great filter yet ahead of us.

We have, as a species, evolved the capacity for morality and rational thought because both of these things aide in our survival. Why would we look elsewhere for external justification for morality?

This is not an argument from nature. I am not suggesting that all things which naturally occur are morally justifiable. Pedophilia is a naturally occurring phenomenon, and yet child sex abuse is still wrong. Rape, murder, any number of violent, anti-social acts are naturally occurring, that property does not confer to them any inherent goodness or badness.


I'm arguing that pro-social traits and behaviour improve the odds of survival for our species, so there is no need to have an external prescriptive morality, nor is it necessary, having dispensed with an external morality, to accept that morality is completely relative.

2611,"&gt; I think you're conflating prescriptive and descriptive morality. I'm talking about the former, you're talking about the latter.

No, I'm not. Prescriptive ethics is about how people ""ought"" to act. I see absolutely no reason to justify any statement about what someone ought to do or ought not to do, unless its beneficial to the survival of our species, and by extention, the survival of the other species with whom we coexist and on whom we are dependent. So when I say we have evolved the capacity to act morally and that's it's in our self-interest, I'm not talking about how people feel about what is right or wrong, I'm talking about the way I can see to possibly justify saying something is prescriptively right or wrong, and that is that it's in the best interest of the species.


I think it's perfectly justifiable to say we should not murder others, not because is wrong on some higher plane of morality somewhere, and breaks some arbitrary rule about suffering or the ""sanctity of life,"" nor is it ok or not ok according to an individual's beliefs about right and wrong. It's wrong to murder because murder is counter to the pro-social behaviour we need to survive as a species on a crowded planet, and because murder decreases the genetic diversity of our gene pool, which is harmful to the population.

2612,"The answer to this: 

&gt; Does that mean that it's morally permissible? Do you know what an appeal to nature is?

and this: 

&gt; Could you elaborate on this? [the value and dignity of the species as a whole]. I don't really know what it means.

Are related.

To the moral absolutist, what is morally permissible is rigidly fixed according to an arbitrarily selected guideline, such as: the rules in a specific religious text, or the injunction to cause no harm to others, or egoism, or whatever rigid rule they have chosen.

To the moral relativist, there is no such absolute right or wrong, its merely a matter of how the individual feels.

Most people actually fall somewhere between these two, and will say that some things are absolute (for example: not killing) and other things are not (for example: whom you can have sex with). 

I, however, think the absolute/relative dichotomy is simply a false dichotomy, and neither makes any rational sense to me and both are arbitrary. The only rational argument I can see is an evolutionary one. What is best for the survival of the species (not the individual, but the species as a whole) is good. Murdering other humans, wiping out whole species, harming the planet - these are all things which put us and our species in detriment, and will prevent us from surviving and hopefully getting off of this planet to propagate in the rest of the universe. 

Why do I not also consider my own personal measurement - the survival of the species - as arbitrary? Because it's a biological drive, and is also the reason we evolved the capacity for morality in the first place. The more pro-social our behaviour, the better we, as a population, survive and thrive.

So while I understand that an ""argument from nature"" is considered fallacious, logically speaking, I'm actually don't think that's a universally invalid invocation. Form and function co-evolve.

2613," &gt; That's because animals and plants aren't moral agents, that is to say that they cannot think about moral concepts and make moral decisions. People can. That's why people are morality responsible but animals are not.

Idk I think this is kind of fallacious. From two perspectives:

1) Some animals do act morally. We see it in other primates, for example. They share, they enforce fairness in others, and they act altruistically.

2) I'm not convinced that morality is not still a form of self-interest on a population level. Other animal species act according to what will best enable them, personally, to survive. And morality is a way in which humans, as a species, act in a way that best enables us, as a species, to survive. It's still evolutionary in nature.

I don't because I choose not to, because I love rabbits too much. Being a person with agency, I am free to decide for myself what I will and will not do, and eating rabbits is not something I will do during my lifetime. 

Now, that said, I do want to reduce the suffering of animals eaten for food. I try to find independent ranches for beef and pork, and free-range chicken, and wild-caught fish, when possible. 

I know that other animals are thinking and feeling, and if I based my morality on the value and dignity of the life of individual organisms, then I think it would be unjustifiable to be anything else other than vegan.

2712,"Sex is so important for a relationship, so no, its not TMI for me. And so often, its something you can't really talk to your peers or family about, so you end up just feeling completely alone and unwanted. And if your partner isn't invested in making it work, or gaslights or evades, then you can't talk to them either.

I hesitate to point you to this place, because it can be a very bitter community at times, but I think you might benefit from a little bit of support from other people who are experiencing what it's like to be in a relationship with limited (or in some cases, no) sex... but here goes: pop into r/deadbedrooms sometime if you need to talk to people about it.

It's wonderful that you are being compassionate with her about her health issues, and it's frustrating that she's not more upfront, but many people carry a lot of guilt and shame for having health problems, particularly if they relate to their sex-life and sexuality. It's sad that that's the case, but it's true. I myself was out of commission for like 7 days with a yeast overgrowth earlier this fall (how's that for TMI?) and although my partner is pretty well versed in women's health issues, having been married and all, and really supporting and care-taking, I was still really ashamed to talk about it or ask for help, and it hurt emotionally to feel that bad about myself and hate my body. Anyway, sickness of any kind sucks.

That said, your need for physical intimacy is real and neglecting it is not good for you or for your relationship. That might just look like other forms of intimacy, when PIV is off the table. If you two are truly mismatched, in terms of libido, then it's probably not going to change, though that's a bitter pill to swallow.

I genuinely hope things turn around for you two.

It also believes that women are not fully intellectually mature at any point in their adult lives. Ever hear of ""the most responsible teenager in the room?"" These are blatant claims of female intellectual inferiority.

TRP also posits that women are incapable of or strongly disinclined toward loyalty, honour, honestly, hard-work, self-sacrifice, or true altruism. You can say those are just observations, and not judgements, but that's dishonest and I think you know it, because TRP claims men are better at these things *and* holds these as virtues to aspire to. That is a moral evaluation of women, a claim that women are morally inferior. 

And all that without even mentioning the slut-shaming.

Without that, it's not actually that different, because a person (male or female) who loves and respects their partner, is not intimidated or dimished or threatened by someone else earning more than they do.

The systems that control us all have rendered anyone below the 1% leisure class unable to make ends meet without two incomes. There is no more provider. If you are angry that man is no longer a provider, take that up with the government, not women who choose divorce. Divorce leaves most women with less debt and fewer financial responsibilities than staying married, with a spouse as dependent. Most divorces involve no alimony at all. The structures that tear us apart, prevent marriage resolution and reward divorce. That's not on women - it's just rational to divorce when a marriage fails AND the economy renders working class males as dead weight.

2743,"Alright. So.... when I was younger (age 7-18) I always masturbated prone (so, lying on my stomach, with my hands putting pressure through a blanket or towel, and with my legs closed and straight behind me.) I had my own room and was free to enjoy myself. 

Then I got to college, and I had a roommate. After being accustomed to masturbating usually every day, it quickly became evident that I would need to find a way to do this, without arousing suspicion. Lying on my stomach humping my hand was no longer an option. Nor was a vibrator. It was a difficult time, until I learned how to do it on my back, with just one finger slowly rubbing my clitoris, as long as I built it up a long time and had a *lot* of porn (fortunately this was my first time having access to porn online, so a little went a long way, though that changed very fast, and that's a different story).

So, as it turned out, prone wasn't what mattered, but the straight legs were. I needed my legs straight to get off, because I stretch them in the process, and I just can't imagine getting off with my legs apart (there is also some ptsd from an assault there. I have no problem with sex but unless there is a penis inside me, I really prefer not to have my legs open). I can't get off with penetration, really. And I don't like it unless it's PIV. No toys, no fingers, it just feels weird. Toys are too hard and fingers are too... not penises. So it's all clitoris, and my clitoris is more engorged and available let when my legs are closed.

Fast forward 10 years and about 20 partners, including a sex-less marriage, 4 years of near-celibacy (2 married, 2 while divorcing), a couple of ONSs, and several wonderful BFs/lovers that are still my friends today, and I've gone a decade getting off on my back, with my legs closed, by myself. Not one of them could get me off, and honestly, I didn't want to try, because it always involved opening my legs, and while I couldn't put my finger on it at the time, that was the core issue.

So at 28, I met my current partner. That was a year ago. And I guess, by then, I had sort of figured out what might work for me. And he also really wanted to do what would work, and listened, and did research. It took only a few weeks, and he was giving me the best, most mind blowing orgasms of my entire life. It's incredible. Unbelievable. All with my legs closed.

How, you ask? I lie on my back, legs closed and he hovers over me (sometimes I fondle his balls with my toes). He holds my lips apart a little bit sometimes with his fingers. Mostly he just focuses on licking down on the left and right side of the clitoral hood slowly, over and over, and then he flattens and softens his tongue and just really, really gently runs in circles over the hood itself, very, very softly, always building up to more pressure, until I'm about to come, and then he backs off and I come crashing over this hill into a magnificent orgasm.

It's changed my whole perspective on life.

I'm practically monogamous now (though he isnt) because it's so good.

And I've even gotten to where I can get off during sex, if it's a second orgasm.

There is a concept we have latched onto, that comes from !Kung bushman in southern Africa from back in the 60s. I think it was Marjorie Shostak who did the field research to document it. She documented that in that community, the euphemism for sex (particularly within a couple) was ""work."" Kids would say that their parents were ""doing their work"" to refer to their parents having sex (which they would have been aware of, since they were sleeping in one-room huts until the kids were 20 or so, and would start sleeping in groups in their own huts). We really, really like this way to think about it.

Yes, it's joyful and fulfilling. But it's also a responsibility we have to ourselves and each other.

Actually, scripting can be really helpful. I usually want to offer solutions, when someone comes to me needing to complain/vent/express frustration. Often, that's not what he wants. He just wants emotional acknowledgement. He wants to here me repeat back to him what he is feeling and express my compassionate sympathy. So he has provided some guidelines.

I said ""people espousing your beliefs."" TRP is a strategy, as you so often like to remind us, and therefore not a belief.

So when a TRPer complains that his voice is being shouted down on the internet by people who disagree with him, it's not invalid to point out that his compatriots (and yes, other misogynists are your compatriots) are doing much more than just disagree.

Look, no one is saying there aren't real issues facing men, we just disagree on the source of those issues, and the solution. For example - the so-called ""disposability"" of men is a patriarchal phenomenon,  not a feminist one. It is patriarchy treats women as a means of production, children as property, and all males other than the patriarch as disposable. Patriarchy isn't all men over all women, it's a few powerful men - patriarchs - over all women and all other men. It's patriarchy the promotes the ""women are wonderful"" narrative - otherwise known as the pedestal. Its patriarchy that promotes ideas about men as sexual predators and deviants, because that aides in rendering them disposable. It is patriarchs who imprison, execute, and draft for wars all those ""disposable"" men. It's patriarchy that seeks to make all persons dependent on the state to better wrest control of the populus. These are the tools and devices of patriarchy. Many MRA concerns are valid, but they don't realize it's patriarchy, not the liberation from it, that have caused their problems. And it's feminism that gives them both language and a voice to talk about their gender issues, even as they disparage gender studies, the very source and validation of their complaints.",2015-11-04 06:20:51+00:00,cwnw0ag,5.0,t1_cwnvj7m,1234.0,PurplePillDebate

I'm a very rationally - minded person and I enjoy articulating specific meanings out loud rather than relying on innuendo and suggestion, so I find it preferable to be with a partner who is the same way. 

It can be hard with someone who disappears into a particular interest, but I'm kind of the same way, and I like learning things, so as long as the person is willing to talk about and teach me about whatever thing they are obsessed with at the moment, I will probably go along for the ride. 

Being on the spectrum comes with challenges, yes. It can make interpersonal relationships hard. It can make public social occasions difficult and stressful. We both love parties but need THC to cope with the heightened noise, stress, and just the exhaustion of social interaction. Special quirks. Occasional OCD tendencies. Anxiety and depression, ask very common. 

But there are so many rewards. Intellectual conversation devoid of deceit. General communication that is open and bluntly honest. Indeed, a preference for honesty over manipulation is really an immeasurable benefit.

She's not addicted to video games. The game is a vehicle, and activity. It's the vibrant social life in the game, the she loves. Those are her friends she's hanging out with. Yes, it looks like she's there, but what's basically happening is gets off at 2 or 3 and then goes out with a group of her friends for 7 hours, and comes home tired and goes to bed. She's neglecting her other relationships, and probably her health, too. She's probably using this to escape other stressors in her life. But it's really no different than being out at the bar will her mates. Again, it's not about the game, it's about the social life.

Now, insofar as it's hurting her personal life, this group of friends is probably best compared to a highly competitive intramural rugby team - a highly unified group that puts a lot of pressure on members to commit a large amount of time to the endavour, and when you don't participate, you miss out both in the game/skills and in the social component, by not being there. For someone starved for social interaction, it can be really, really hard to set boundaries on your time, or even recognize that you need them.

It's not a bad idea to talk to her therapist about it. But don't demonize the game. That won't get you anywhere. Talk about it in terms of her choosing to hang out with her friends all the time instead of with you. Your needs are not being met in this relationship, nor is she coming to you to meet hers.

Just because it makes up 10% doesn't mean it's not there. And yes, teaching the women are to men as Christ is to the church, and that women must be obedient, and cannot teach or be priests in the church. Teaching that women are ""unclean"" when they are menstruating. These are sexist at best, and have been used to justify a lot of misogyny. 


You can parse the origin of the word ""homophobia"" all you like, but Paul is unequivocal in his denigration of same-sex relationships and sex acts. The bible actively teaches that these are wrong.

&gt; Homosexuality is something that's clearly not intended by God

This is not a point I'm going to argue with you. Im simply going to remark that this is only ""clearly"" the case, if you accept the bible as inerrant. There is no other reason to think that same-sex attraction is anything other than perfectly natural, since it occurs in nature in ours and other species, with exclusive homosexuality occurring in about 3%-10% of the population, and bisexuality occurring in about 25%-30% of the population. That's 28%-40%, that's pretty high, for something that's ""clearly not intended"" to happen. The only basis for saying it's not God's intent is the biblical text itself. 

And, I'm sorry, did you just say there is ""no exclusivism"" in the Bible and then, in the same post, insist that ""Allah is definitely not God."" That's what I'm talking about - the biblical claim to be the only true word of God and everyone else's beliefs are wrong. 

There is no way to prove the existence of God, and I personally don't claim to know anything that I have no evidence for. We can hope. We cannot know.

""Puritan"" specifically refers to a specific regional religious heritage here, which has survived among religious adherents today who have literally made sex education illegal in public schools.

So yeah, if you want to be offended, feel free. But it seems completely obvious to me that your reasons for not speaking about it with your parents are not due to a sex-negative culture, and therefore not relevant. Whereas the majority of respondants who are alarmed, are alarmed because they don't think teenagers should be having sex at all anyway, even though this is completely unrealistic and unhealthy.

If you plan never to talk to your kids about sex, good luck. For those of us who live somewhere where we are the only support system and source of information available, we have to do it. ",2015-11-03 18:37:23+00:00,cwn5fmt,6.0,t1_cwn56vj,336.0,sex

Also, we're not talking about anyone deciding for you who you can and can't have sex with, we're talking about your relationships being lived out in the open, an not in secret. And the includes your sexual relationships, when you are legally a minor.

Teaching children that the need to lie, sneak around, and hide their intimate relationship is harmful to them, I think. It opens the door for dating violence and sexual coercion, and fosters a culture of shame and misinformation.

I know its probably impossible for you to imagine what this looks like, irl, to have a open and sex-positive home, but trust me, it works pretty well, and the outcome is people waiting later to have sex, using more protection, and having fewer unplanned pregnancies.

2870,"I'm going to give you three pieces of advice that helped me overcome a 10 year period without any partner getting me off. These three things have proven key for me, and although I still struggle sometimes, I can reliably get off with him if we do it right.

* Take breaks for kissing. Stop what you are doing and completely deprive yourself for a few seconds or minutes in order to make out and feel him close to you, before he goes back down there. Do this anytime you feel like you need to refocus. It will help you connect emotionally, and give your genitals a break from the stimulation. 

* Less is more. The less you start with, the more you have to build up to. If you start at mouth, hands, vibrator - there's not really much to go to from there. Start gently, and return to gentleness if it stops feeling progressively better.

* Remember that orgasms happen in your brain. Practice mindfulness in your daily life (Google will help) and practice redirecting your mind either to the present moment, or to a fantasy, while you are being sexually stimulated. When you drift, refocus. Ask him to kiss you. Get centred. Then try again. 

Even if none of this helps you, please, please take this last piece of advice to heart - never stop trying. It's hard work, and you might feel selfish, or guilty, or pressured, or mad at yourself, but whatever else you think or feel, please DON'T stop working at it. Because as you've observed, an orgasm from a partner can be... transcendent. Don't give up on it. It's worth the work.",2015-11-03 05:45:03+00:00,cwmlffp,1.0,t3_3q5vc5,739405.0,TwoXSex

People are disparaging your chosen roles in your relationship and I think that's lame. Do whatever you want and works for you to. He's bringing working and earning full time, you are in school.

And it varies based on factors like what kind of partner you want, and what the women you admire in your life are like. Possibly an innate preference.

It's more evolutionarily advantageous to be aroused by intelligence, obviously. But people will range all along the spectrum of evolutionarily advantageous traits.

This statement makes no sense to me. For an organism to evolve the capacity for consciousness, it only has to have a functioning wake/sleep cycle and be sentient. For the kind of self-awareness that human, other primates, and some other mammals have, you just need a more complex brain.

There is nothing ""innate"" to ""matter"" - matter is just stuff. If you arrange it one way, you get a star. If you arrange it another way, you get a brain with synapses that are firing. Consciousness, and the ""self"" are not qualities or attributes. They are functions that develop out of simply electrical impulses firing along neurons. 

You could say that matter have the capacity to form life, and that life has the capacity to become sentient, conscious, and self-aware. But attributing ""life"" or agency to non-agents (stars, planets, the weather, trees) is/was just a way for people to explain things they don't understand and cannot predict.

Someone who habitually goes out to pick up girls at parties and bars just to sleep with them is not the sort of man I want to be with. But yes, the fact that other women have been attracted to him and wanted to be in relationships with him would make someone more attractive. That's true for both sexes, though.

It validates how sexy I find him. But again, he feels the same way with me, though I don't really date other people much, because reasons.

Clearly, people who have been in a long series of dysfunctional relationships are a worse choice that people who have never been in one at all, imo, so yeah, someone who has been dating their whole life and still doesn't know how to communicate effectively and be respectful and appreciative of their partner, and indeed, believes abusive behaviour is normal and ok, would be a worse option than someone with no experience. That doesn't really undermine the fact that it makes rational sense to select for someone with a history of functional relationships or who has grown and matured after leaving a dysfunctional one.

But I'm also approaching that selection process as a divorcée. And I actually met my partner, himself a divorcé, and sharing this bond of both having married the wrong person, young, and then leaving after 2 years (for me, abuse; for him, deadbedroom and she didn't want kids). We take the responsibility to grow and nurture our relationship very seriously, and it's working quite well.

And yeah, I totally get that catch-22 of being at a certain age where you are too old to never have dated, but can't date because you didn't ever. But that's why I suggested inventing some exes.

However, it's not unreasonable to say, though, that someone who has only had one-night-stands (man or woman) is not experienced as a relationship partner. 

Indeed, someone who has had only one-night-stands is exactly as inexperienced in committed relationships as someone who has not ever had unpaid sex, whether or not he has gone to a sex worker.

I'm not saying either of these people are bad people, or that they are damaged by their choices or circumstances, or could never be good partners. 

I'm just saying that I would select against someone without experience being in a functional relationship *or*, better yet, experience in at least one failed relationship where they learned about themselves, reflected on what went wrong, and committed to choosing a better partner and building a better relationship with someone new.

I don't understand why that seems like a problem to you. It's a way of knowing that tests itself and corrects it own errors. I also cannot really understand any other way of assessing reality. People made observations that led to the conclusion that the earth is flat. Later, other people made new observations that led to the conclusion that the earth is spherical. So yes, the earlier ""fact"" turned out the be untrue.

Which brings us to the assertion ""There is a God."" Saying that this assertion is not a fact is NOT the same thing as saying it's not true. Truth is a different issue. When we say that the assertion ""There is a God"" is an assertion, not a fact, we're saying that this statement is not something we can empirically measure or prove to be a fact, because it's not a claim based in evidence. And that's all that a ""fact"" in this exercise, and under empiricism, is: something that can be concluded from evidence.

So again, I don't see how this exercise is a problem. Surely we can all agree there is no empirical way to prove gods existence? There may be some other way, using another epistomology, but that's not the skill set being tested in this case.",2015-10-29 00:17:57+00:00,cwgkjox,14.0,t1_cwgi8dz,3584.0,Christianity

Yeah, you're right about that. It's odd to think about it going for that long. My partner is so attuned, that if anything is off for me he usually picks up on it immediately. It's like the air pressure in the room changes. There is no way he would persist without any input from me for more than 30 seconds, much less 30 minutes. I guess I was imagining this happening much faster.

This is a lovely sentiment, honestly. It reminds me of a line from Welcome to Nightvale that my partner and I quote to each other often because we liked it so much. The actual line is about a pet, but it works with pretty much everything in life:

""No pet/partner/child/relationship is perfect. They *become* perfect when you accept them for what they are.""

You seem to believe yourself to be objectively ugly, but many women are not dating for looks, anyway. Try meeting some single mother who just wants a nice guy who won't hit her. Surely there is someone.


But if there isn't (and I don't want this to be true, but it very well may be) then I suggest reading about monastic orders of the past and present. There are many supportive materials that can help you cope with the lonliness.

3020,"&gt; Have you ever actively wanted casual sex instead of a relationship?

Casual isn't the right word for it, but I have sought non-committed relationships in the past, and I genuinely wanted to have sex with other people, outside of my primary relationship (I was in an open relationship). However, those people were not random hook-ups. I talked to them at length, and went on dates, and got to know them, and if they seemed cool, I would maybe sleep with them. I can think of 2-3 of these fellows, and those were, to me, legitimate dating relationships. They just weren't exclusive or primary. All remain good friends of mine today. 

I've also been in many relationships that were deliberately intended to not be permanent. People I was having a good time with, but we both knew it wasn't going to go anywhere, and yet we still had a great time.  

I have never, ever, met someone at a bar or club or other public thing and then randomly gone home with them and hooked up. That's gross. Typically, I sleep with my friends, because then I know them and we can stay friends afterward.

&gt; Have you ever actively wanted to sleep around as opposed to being with one solid partner?

These aren't really mutually exclusive, are they? I definitely, 100% prefer to have a primary partner, but that doesn't preclude sex with other people. Though I, personally, don't really do this now that I'm with a partner who can actually get me off. Since then, I haven't had any interest at all in being with anyone else, because it just pales in comparison.

&gt; Have you ever had sex with a guy, or been intimate / dated him in some respect, wanted a relationship, but ultimately been rebuffed because he was unwilling to commit? If not, do you think this happens a lot to other women?

Not really. Most of my relationships have been founded on a clear agreement that we are not going to stay together. Typically this is at my behest. But I did stay in a 2.5 year relationship with someone because we were planning to stay together in the longer term, and we ultimately broke up because he didn't want children, and I already have one. I don't think he misled me. I think we grew apart and found we wanted different things.

I don't know what is happening to other women but I suspect there are a lot of relationships out there lacking open and honest communication. 


&gt; Have you ever been with a guy who has implied that he's massively into you and wants a long-term relationship, which is what you wanted, but he is in fact simply lying? If not, do you think this happens a lot to other women?

No. And I have no idea what happens to other women. 


&gt; How old were you when you first felt that you wanted a long-term relationship, steady boyfriend or to 'settle down'? Or if you don't want to yet, how old are you now?

All along. There has never been a time when I didn't want to a LTR, but I'm also a realist, so it's perfectly rational to have relationships that I know won't last forever, because it fulfills a need and keeps us both warm at night, on the understanding that one or both of us will probably eventually meet someone who is a better long term match.

How does making her feel like she violated you help your relationship or help bring her out of her low libido.

3051,"It's a good theoretical question, though it's hard to imagine two diametrically opposed options that are both equally rational. The only way that happens is if they are motivated by two completely different core values - that is, that we consider different things to be more important in weighing what is the most correct outcome. While that hasn't happened yet, I imagine it will.

It's still hard to imagine there there isn't any measure, any where, that we could select to break the tie. So, most likely, we would consult other people for advice and input. 

* Does the decision affect the child in our family? What would be in her best interest?

* What do our respective parents think? How much to we weigh those opinions, based on their past experiences and failings. 

* What do our respective therapists think? What would be best for the mental health of the most people in the family?

I also think it's important to note that this decision would not happen in isolation. It would be one of several such instances, and it's perfectly reasonable to say that, in these cases, if there is literally NO way to rationally resolve the question, we would agree to trade off on who gets to make the call, and flip a coin for who goes first. Probably best out of ten, to be honest. And we'd each flip 5 of them.

The other thing to pull out of this that really, really makes little sense to me, is this line of yours: 

&gt; One of you is going to lose this one. 

There is no losing. *It's not a zero-sum game.* We aren't negotiating to see who wins or loses. We are trying to decide what is best for BOTH of us, not each get our own way. If I'm this confident in my option over his, its because I think it will be better for him than his option will be, not just better for me.

Which is why this consequence: 

&gt; One of you is not going to get what they want.

Is moot. Yes, sure, one of us will have to make a compromise in the short term. But the other one will get exactly what they were hoping for. If my partner is happy and got the outcome he wanted and which believes will result in the best possible outcome for all three (or more!) of us, then I win too. If we go my route, he wins too. Because we're a team. We're not in competition. He might not have wanted to go my route, but once it's decided, we're in it together. The goal of the game is not to get your own way, it's to come to a decision and then work as a team to make it happen. The decision is the win, and it's a win for both of us.

We have different skills, strengths, interests, and hobbies. We overlap at about 30% of our shared activities, but it's growing as he becomes more involved in raising a kid, and I become a more experienced gamer. Still, we think 50% overlap is about optimal. We are also both perfectly good cooks, and about equally motivated to keep the house in order. We complement each other. That doesn't require either of us to be a leader and the other a follower. It doesn't require a hierarchy.

It's really not that complicated. I think it would be way more complicated to navigate a hierarchy or communicate through signs and signals instead of openly saying what we mean. 

Arguably, the kind of relationship we have is only possible because we both have several years of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy behind us. We use a lot of the same language to communicate wants, needs, and expectations. We also communicate verbally way beyond normal couples, I've observed. We tend to establish consent for sexual activities out loud pretty much every time we engage in anything. And it happens very naturally. We spend time talking about what it working and what is not working, pretty much every week. This prevents the build up of resentment or the chance that we will start communicating strategically and not openly. 

It probably helps that we are both high IQ and possibly a little bit on the spectrum. We find the thing that unites us most is a mutual respect for each other's ability to think clearly and rationally, even about issues in which we are deeply emotionally invested (for example - really, really wanting to cohabit, but choosing to delay because in the long run its the more fiscally responsible choice, and will result in greater future happiness.) Neither of us could tolerate being in a relationship with someone we didn't respect as our intellectual equal.

But these girls are also bottom-of-the-barrel, spoiled, selfish, and just plain stupid. Every one of them will marry for money if they are lucky, because they have little else going for them.

They have nothing in common with any other women I've ever known. These girls represent a tiny, tiny minority of young 20-24 year old upper middle class white women in the south. Even in that category, they are a tiny minority. I've only really ever met 2 or 3 tops.

Now, I don't doubt there are a few more out there, and if you troll bars for dumb girls who will let you fuck them, I'm sure you'll find some.

But if you actually want a relationship with a partner, someone who is your intellectual equal (or, gods forbid, superior!), this method will systematically weed out anyone who isn't dumb and doesn't want to be bullied by an asshole boyfriend. 

This method is guaranteed to find you someone who is weak willed, weak minded, and a poor candidate for partnership and reproduction. 

But of course, since TERPs generally are not comfortable with women who exceed them intellectually or in any other capacity, and indeed find that ""unfeminine"" and a ""perversion of the natural order"" (when clearly what we're talking about is a few bruised egos and so, so much insecurity), obviously they want someone who will fawn over them and think they are the best thing since sliced bread.

I, personally, had been to several funerals since coming to terms with my mortality as a young teenager, and it's never easy when other people insist on asserting their worldview that there is a life after this one. However, it's pretty much the only time you cant really confront people about pushing their beliefs, or fault them for relying on them, because this kind of thing is exactly what religion is for: to comfort you in times of pain, fear, or grief. So while it may be hurtful to you, it's hard to hold to it against them when they are just trying to cope.

I, personally, try to avoid addressing the beliefs of the people around me. I don't refute them, and say ""there is no Heaven.""

Conceded.

Do you have any other data to use to show that the 96% of men who fall along the overlapping bell-curve are somehow better at performing cognitive tasks than all the women who score the same as them?

Besides, devaluing the ability to multitask makes absolutely no sense at all, especially in this stage of human evolution. Regardless, apart from a very small number of people, these measures are not really that significant. Female brains operate differently from male brains in some ways, but they end up getting essentially the same scores on many tasks. And where scores differ, it's not that dramatic. There is certainly no evidence that the scores where men out-perform women are necessarily beneficial ones, anyway.

I'm attracted to men who are good with kids, patient and kind with the elderly, who think clearly and critically, and are compassionate and gentle, almost to a fault. I prefer someone who performs their gender less normatively, and who is bisexual. These are all pro-social traits that will make that person a better community member, a better parent, and a better partner to me in the long run, and therefore make evolutionary sense to select for. 

What does that look like in practice?

I find there is almost NOTHING sexier than a man in an apron baking cookies with a small child, or reading a bedtime story. It's not just cute, its *deeply sexually arousing*. Deep in my primate brain, I immediately want to mate with that man. This is, again, evolutionary. 

Notice, though, that ""dominance"" is not an attractive feature at all, and has nothing to do with what makes a man attractive to me, personally, nor what makes sense in mate selection, evolutionarily. Dominance, authority, aggression, control - these are anti-social behaviours and traits and make for poor community members, parents, and partners, and are best selected out.

So ""more"" means up from .1% to like 1%? That's not a lot of difference in positive outcomes, on a population level.

If your only objective here is to make a case against legal abortion by comparing it suicide, well, I've already outlined why I think it's a poor comparison to begin with.

3102,"Where is that straw man coming from? In practice, legal suicide permits for the incurable to choose suicide, as has happened in recent cases. But I feel no qualms at all about requiring them to try treatment.

Regardless, your analogy between suicide and abortion is weak at best. A person choosing not to be pregnant anymore have almost no adverse side effects, whereas pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood have incredible drawbacks and life-long consequences to your physical and mental health. The choice to abort is as morally weighted and deserves as much forethought as the choice to donate a kidney to stranger. Sure, you could choose to do it if you want to, but you certainly don't have to even register as a donor if you don't want to. 

Basically, when we talk about bodily autonomy, we're talking about two different things: in the case of suicide, we're talking about doing whatever you want with your own body; and in the case of abortion, or consent during sex, or medical informed consent, we're talking about being free to decide what other people get to do with our bodies. 

I don't really have a problem with making sure that people who want to kill themselves actually want that, before they do it.

Whereas I see no reason at all to second guess a woman making the choice to stop a fetus sucking nutrients from her, any more than I want to second guess her decision to stop a man from penetrating her body with his penis, or to stop a doctor from administering a blood transfusion she doesn't want.

Clearly its hard to make a good case for saying that an otherwise healthy person making a rational decision to terminate their life cannot do so because just wanting to do so means they must mentally ill. That's not what we're talking about. We could reclassify an isolated desire to commit suicide, devoid of other symptoms, as non-illness. That wouldn't change the fact that for the majority of people who want to commit suicide, that comes along with all kinds of cognitive distortions, hallucinations, delusions, mood disorder, or another neuro-chemical imbalance. Someone experiencing those kinds of symptoms cannot be reliably assessed to be making the choice to end their life for a rational reason, and must be treated first. And for many, many more, the desire is a response to circumstantial pressure (lost job, bullying, etc) and should also be screened for.

3160,"&gt; 1) Do you guys have houses directly connected to Main Road or anyone of you live in Housing Society? We have a thing called housing society where all the houses are build by a land developer and then sold. These houses are connected to a society road, which is maintained by the local society president. This road is connected to main city road.

We have both of these, and other options. Housing in the US is either in organically grown neighbourhoods that connect directly to publicly maintained roads (many are small side streets, but are still public and maintained by the local authority), or in housing developments run by someone who build all the houses and sells them to individuals, or in apartment buildings that rent or sell to residents, or on larger rural properties.

It should also be noted that fewer than 15% of people in the US live in cities. We are very spread out and there is a very large rural population, though suburban and small towns are where the vast majority of American's live. 

&gt; 2) I know US is a first world country so there is very low direct corruption in US, but what about Indirect corruption? like here, the local police commissioner, county commissioner, health commissioner, would get favors in their local jurisdiction. If they go to local movie shop, restaurants, bar, shops, etc. people would give them free service. No one would take the money.

There is corruption at every level here, as everywhere, but here it's mostly high-level corruption. Politicians paying consultants to gerrymander their districts so that one party is vastly over-represented in local government. Also, in the assigning of government contracts. As for free eating - I'm pretty sure cops eat for free in my town, tbh. 

&gt; 3) In India, School Children get 2 vacations. One in Summer 1.5 months long. One in Diwali, which is biggest festival of Hindus, for 15 days. What about US?

We have four, typically, but it varies length and time because they are set by individual schools and school districts. In Texas you get 3 months in the summer (mid-May to mid-August but the exact weeks vary by school or district), a few days around thanksgiving (November), 2 weeks at Christmas/New Years, and 1 week in spring for ""Spring Break"" (I'm sure you've heard that referenced before). My  daughter attends private school currently, and they have teacher development days and other days off as well, which make up another 21 or days and half days, scattered throughout the year. However, since I work full time, (as do most parents here because there really isn't much of a middle class anymore and hardly anyone can get by on just one income) she has to come to work with me on days off, and on holidays I either have to take time off (I only have 6 days I can use during the year to take off from work, which is obviously not much) or she has to go to camps or other activities during her holidays. These can be great and educational, BUT they are expensive and usually the hours are a challenge. This past summer I spent 15% of my annual income on summer programs so that I could work while she was out of school. I will spend another 30% of my income on her private school for this year. This is an expense most people do not choose to take on though, and next year she will be in a public school, as sad as I am about that. 

&gt; 4) In India, people would use their car for long distance and for shorter distance like going to drop their children 2 blocks away, the would use their motorcycle or scooter. What about US? Do people always use car?

Most people only own cars, and would not have a scooter or motorcycle unless they a) needed it because they didn't have a car or b) wanted one for a hobby, but not really to use for things like groceries. Its pretty much all cars. We don't even have very good public transit, so we use cars for long commutes, too. I commute 1 hr to work and 1.5 hrs back every day (traffic makes it take longer in the afternoons). However, there are communities where walking or riding a bicycle is much, much more common: New York, Seattle, Portland, parts of Colorado, all over Washington State and Oregon, etc.

Another component of this is simply that gas artificially cheap here, partly because we are fracking now, and also because we haven't raised the gas tax to rise with inflation, which we really urgently need to do, but no one has the political will to do it. The gas tax funds a fund to maintain our infrastructure, which is collapsing and urgently needs maintenance and repair, and in many places needs to be replaced completely. But we don't have the money because of many, many reasons, mostly regarding the stranglehold of ultra-conservatives in congress preventing collecting ANY new tax revenue. 

&gt; 5) How do parents punish their children in US when they misbehave or they don't study? Is small violence applicable in US? In India, people would spank lightly to their children as punishment. ( Lightly, not up to abusive spank.)

This varies by sub-culture. It's a very diverse country. In many cultures here, even a slight slap is not acceptable, but legally, parents have a lot of leeway on what they can use in the way of physical discipline. HOWEVER, the bulk of people use time-outs, grounding, the removal or privileges, to discipline. This is because most studies have shown those are better for teaching self-control and they actually work better than hitting.

There are a number of neurologic conditions that affect the elderly that can result in sexual acting out.

However, his grooming pattern suggests there is not a medical origin for this behaviour. Your should definitely, definitely tell your family, because if he's behaving this way with you, he may well be acting this way with other people, who are too afraid to say anything.

A straighter spine and the beginnings of bipedalism could have caused all kind of chronic pain issues and compromised reproductive advantages in primates while we were tree-dwelling, but were also the beginning of an adaptation for ground dwelling bipedal locomotion. We are only capable of bipedal parambulation because someone was tending toward that capacity before it was evolutionary advantageous, and when it became advantageous, those individuals were able to reproduce and survive more successfully. 

Not understanding how maladaptive traits become adaptive because of ecological changes is the fundamental gap in understanding of how evolution works.
 

Myriad other examples exist. We can back to lizards who had brittle bones - a highly maladaptive trait as a land-dwelling animal - being advantaged when it become more advantageous to climb trees for food and safety, and eventually, to acquire flight, something with requires an essentially hollow bone structure.

3182,"*Artificially* removing traits perceived to be maladaptive is counterproductive in the long run, because traits that are maladaptive now may well be adaptive in the future. Preserving these ensures a greater capacity for adaptation as a species later. 

Eugenics is the artificial manipulation of the gene pool, or removal or traits that could otherwise survive through reproduction, if only in marginal numbers. Those variants may be maladaptive today, but there is absolutely no way to predict that they will not prove to be adaptive in future ecological circumstances. Those that cannot survive, will not. But those that can, will, and the greater the available diversity within a given gene pool, the more adaptable the species is to a changing ecology.

Because we have no idea what future conditions will be on this or other planets our species may inhabit, the greater the diversity in our gene pool, the more robust we are as a species. This is basic population genetics.

So, if everything about who we are is a function of neurons firing in our brains, and all of that data is lost when the organ fails, then nothing can survive past death. 

That was pretty much the beginning of the end, for me. I think I retained some notion that God might exist (and indeed, a sincere belief for some of that time) and I would have explained away salvation theology and the resurrection narrative as a metaphor for your energy and matter rejoining the rest of the system again. It all worked fine for me.

But basically since then, I've accepted that all humans are mortal. Or, as my favourite poet Gerard Manley Hopkins (somewhat paradoxically a Jesuit priest) says, ""All life, Death does end, and each day dies with sleep.""

So here I am, 16 years and several death later, and I'm still the only person in my family who believes this. 

Believing that death isn't actually death makes it easier in some ways, it's true. Without that belief, it feels like a much greater loss. But I'm ok with that. It is a profound loss, when someone we know and love dies. But my partner (also a secularist) and I believe that it's still a beautiful thing, to consider that every atom in your body once burned in the heart of a star, and that your constituent parts will go back into the system of matter and energy whence they came. It's quite lovely.

Personally, I'd like to be promessed after I die. Look up ""promession."" Its not available yet but I have hopes. I want to be promessed and planted under a flowering tree.",2015-10-23 02:02:25+00:00,cw9lrkr,1.0,t3_3pth5j,19980.0,atheism

3255,"I'm so sorry for what you are going through. I'm very much dreading losing my parents, though hopefully that's still a long way off from now. 

My uncle, to whom I was very close, died young at 42 of brain cancer, leaving behind my aunt and my cousin, who was 10 at the time. That was 7 years ago. During two of the last three years of his life, I actually lived with them, so I was there to see it first hand. While I was there, there was still hope that he would maybe pull through, but about six months after I moved out, they found out it was back and bigger, and less than year later he was gone.

My aunt and cousin, and all of my uncles family, and all of my family, are religious. Not bible-thumping, exactly - they are WASPy Presbyterians and Methodist (3 ministers in that group though). For them, losing my uncle just meant that he is going on to a better place, to live with God, or become one with the universe, or some variation of an afterlife belief. I don't think any one among them is an atheist.

My partner also recently lost his beloved grandmother (just this past spring) and one of the hardest parts about saying goodbye to her was hearing his family talking about Jesus and God and how they will all be together again in the next life - his family is more traditionally Bible-believing, conservative Christian.

Those beliefs are really comforting for my family, and for his. Really soothing in a storm of uncertainly, pain, loss, and grief. It's easier to lose someone if you just tell yourself that they aren't really gone. 

However, he and I are secularist. We are materialists. And whereas losing eternal life was, for him, a conclusion following his deconversion, for me it was the very first step out of belief. I came to the logical conclusion that human consciousness is an organic process, and that therefore, when we die, nothing of who we are survives. Death is final. Or, as my favourite poet says, ""All life, Death does end, and each day dies with sleep."" 

And so, for us, coping with death is different. We don't look to a future and hope to see the person again. We reflect on the utter improbability of human existence, and the epic reality that everything we are made out of, every single atom, once burned in the heart of a star. Our matter and energy has returned to the system whence it came, and we live on in the conscious memory and genetic progeny we leave behind. 

So now is the time to spend as much time as you can with her. Document everything. Help her go through all of her things, her papers, her photos, and get organized - it will be something to keep her mind occupied, and you will learn SO MUCH about her that you never knew. Ask her everything you ever wanted to ask her. Record all of it, if you want. Document this amazing person in your life and cherish every memory. The time is now. 

I don't know if that will help you, at all.

3256,"You're assuming, as is typical, that having a forum of women's opinions would result in an echo-chamber. Which is stupid. Women have diverse opinions. Plenty of women do not consider minor annoyances to be a manifestation of harassment or sexism. A woman saying she doesn't mind being catcalled would be an interesting perspective. A non-woman coming in here and saying we shouldn't feel harassed by catcalling is not really a valid women's perspective, and does nothing to contribute to the conversation. We don't need an injection of male perspectives in order to question or disagree. We already have extreme and fundamental disagreements, among ourselves, and issues like BC, abortion, gender hierarchy in marriages, dating, sex and sexuality... pretty much everything. 

Example: the stupid air conditioning thing this summer. No, keeping the office cold is not sexist. It's just easier to keep people happy and productive when they aren't hot. It decreases hostility, that's why jails are kept cold, too. BUT also, no, it's not unreasonable to push it up from 70 to 72 to accommodate people who are too miserably cold to work, as that undermines their productivity, which is the whole point of the temperature in the first place.

3319,"I grew up outside of the US, including 5 years in Western Europe, and a decade in Asia. I'm well aware of the non-representative nature of US culture. But ""western countries"" are also emphatically not representative of the world at large, either.

Western Europe is a rare exception in a world that is still predominantly patriarchal. Pretty much everywhere else, the Catholic Church, or Islam, or other socially conservative or patriarchal cultural institutions, still influence public policy and public opinion. 

And yes - abortion is outright ILLEGAL in all of Central America, much of South America, most of Africa, and most of the Middle East, and in many parts of South East Asia, with some countries making exceptions only if the mother's life is in imminent danger. [Here is a helpful map](http://images.flatworldknowledge.com/tye/tye-fig10_005.jpg). Notice that even in Europe, abortion at will is not a universal right. It's illegal in Ireland, virtually illegal Poland except to save a life, and restricted to having a good reason, in the UK and Finland. Abortion is even restricted in Australia, and there is a strong and vocal faction there trying to ban it entirely. 

AND the gestation cut-off in European countries is much earlier than in the US, generally. Here there are still states where there is no limit at all, in Europe it's typically 12 weeks. That's even earlier than the cut-off in Texas. 

So yes, the global narrative is still overwhelmingly against women having the right to choose to terminate pregnancy just because they don't want to have the child, and the most common response is usually to say, she shouldn't have taken the risk if she didn't want the consequences. Taking issue with the use of the word ""universal"" ignores the qualifiers I included. The overwhelming majority of the world still opposes abortion rights. 

(And before you bring up China - that's a country where you can be forced to have an abortion against your will, and the government administers your mandatory birth control, so that is not representative of a nation where women have bodily/reproductive autonomy, and doesn't count. There, instead of ""if you didn't want a baby you shouldn't have had sex,"" its ""if you didn't want to have an abortion, you shouldn't have had sex."" It's the same thing.)

3335,"&gt; that doesn't mean that perspective has any resemblance to what actually happens [in] pregnancy

That's pretty much exactly what happens. A foreign entity is leaching your bodily resources from you, and growing, and moving. Every single time a cell splits once it's implanted, its because it's stolen those building blocks from your body. You provide all the materials for it to grow. And if that's a miraculous new life to you, that's amazing, and you are happy to let it grow there, and give it what it needs.

If it's just an unwanted foreign entity, it's quite horrific. It's messing with your hormones, changing the way your body works, causing your joints to loosen, causing pain and discomfort, and then it starts moving, and it's so creepy. And I kept my pregnancy. I still didn't feel anything at all for the thing inside of me at any point in the process. 

&gt; Where's the concern for the childs autonomy? 

We were talking about her best interests. We weren't talking about the fetus' best interest.

Is it preferably to be born unwanted, or never to be born at all? I don't know. 

As for it's autonomy - it's not an autonomous being for quite some time. It's wholly dependent on another organism in order to survive. No medical intervention can save it, up to a certain point. So there is no autonomy at that point. You all talk about a ""right to life."" But that's not really what's happening. Allowing an embryo or fetus to live off of the bodily resources of another person, against that person's will - to subjugate that woman to the life of the fetus - that's simply not equal rights. No other person at any point in life has the absolute right to demand the resources of another to sustain them. Otherwise we would all be obligatory organ donors. 

And if she doesn't want to have it, then taking a pill and passing a clot of blood and tissue (which is the stage at which 90% of abortions are administered) is not murder, its just a heavy period / minor miscarriage. It happens to everyone, and we all just move on with our lives. 50% of implanted embryos are miscarried anyway.

That said - I concur that it should be reacted to positively by our systems and structures. We should not require young couples to go into crippling debt just in order to start a family. We should be bending over backward to help make it easier for them, so that we have future taxpayers to support us. 

So programs to help mothers will definitely cut down on the number of people who make the choice to abort for financial reasons, sure. It would also make it easier for people who want to have children, to do so. My partner and I are crushed that we will probably not be able to afford the family we want to have because of the cost of having a child and raising it. 

But supporting mothers is not enough. We need to prevent pregnancy in all cases except when someone, on purpose, decides they want to conceive. Every woman who isn't actively trying to get pregnant, should ideally have long-acting birth control in place, starting in her teens. Unplanned pregnancy should be virtually impossible, because in order to get pregnant, someone should have to plan to see a doctor, remove her long acting BC, and then deliberately try to get pregnant.

The fact that 50 percent of pregnancies in the US are unplanned is appalling. 

Until we prevent pregnancy effectively and consistently, there will always be people who want and need abortions. ",2015-10-20 16:23:22+00:00,cw6ibse,8.0,t1_cw6hh0i,1265.0,Christianity

&gt; So like the men who could not look at Medusa’s face otherwise they would be killed, realize that if you look on your wife’s face when she is displaying a sinful attitude toward sex it will kill your sexual pleasure and may actually make it much more difficult for you to achieve the physical connection and release that you need. Again you know you want that emotional connection too, but your wife is the one who is in sinful rebellion against God’s design for sex in your marriage and is refusing to emotionally connect with you.


He's positing that she's being sinful for not wanting to have sex with you, and therefore you should just ignore that and do it anyway. 

That's a problem. 

Sure, he's basically side-stepping the problem of a wife who refuses to grudgingliny consent, but how valid is consent when it's coerced, or when you are taught to believe that you have no right to give or withdraw consent?

He's literally offering an answer to the question: 

&gt; “So HOW do I have sex with my wife knowing she is not in the mood?”

That's a problem.

It's good, but it's still not a reliable orgasm. And it always feels forced. BUT, it's the only way I can get off during PIV so it's definitely worth having one just for this purpose.

I typically use mine to get off right before going to sleep. This was becoming very lonely for me, so I asked him to face me and be there with me, which he does by lying on my shoulder playing with my nipples while he drifts off to sleep. He usually wakes up a tiny bit to pinch my nipples and smile vaguely when I do actually get off (it can take like 20 minutes of starting and stopping) but I think that's an automatic reaction now. Regardless, it's great, it feels very intimate and not as lonely. There is a degree to which I feel pressure to finish, but i don't think it's that much worse with an audience, since I know he's not really paying attention. 

However, habitual vibrator usage makes it very hard for me to get off without it. Last weekend was the first time in..... idk..... *MONTHS*, that he was able to get me off, fully, with oral sex. It had gotten so frustrating that I stopped wanting him to try. Sex was becoming about his orgasm only, and then I would just get myself off at bedtime. It's lonely that way. I want to share that experience with him. I want to let him give it to me. 

I have a difficult relationship with vibrators and porn generally, going back to my teen years. And while I'm all for other people doing what makes them happy, I also know that this is not making me happy, it's making me feel cut off and it's not good for me. 

I wish I could summon the willpower to quit it long enough to reset my arousal. I bet it would only take a few days of getting too drunk to get off, and passing out. But I don't want to do that to my liver either, and that's hardly willpower, that's just wrecking my life in another way.

I have pretty much sole custody (apart from 3-4 visits of no more than a few hours, during family events). I sometimes have babysitting from my parents, but I never spent a single night away from my child until she was 7. I actually started to really over do it - spending one night a week away from her with my partner during the school week, but we decided this was not a good practice and desisted.~~ [I decided this wasn't helpful.]

However, we live with my partner on the weekends (and have done for about 10 months now) and then live with my parents during the week.

In fact, its become so difficult for us that we simply don't go home on Sundays anymore. It adds 30mins and considerable stress to my monday morning commute, but it's better than the crushing lonliness and sadness of going home Sunday nights. Without my meds, I just can't handle it anymore, so we sleep over sunday night now and separate in the mornings. It's helping.

No, it's really not. Apart from the many other Gods born as humans or sent down as humans, and the many Gods who are killed by humans, he's also pretty typical in Jewish sainthood narratives, for the resurrection and haunting people after death, which is quite common. So, no. The religious / magical components are not especially unique at all.


HOWEVER - Jesus the Man (if he existed) was a Nazarene peasant, illiterate and impoverished, who, after his famous cousin John the Baptist was murdered, took up the mantel as an apocalyptic Jewish preacher, preaching Apocalyptic Judaism to other Jews, showed up in Jerusalem, and caused a riot at the temple (which was controlled  by the Jewish priesthood leadership and the Roman empire's local governing body.) As a result, he was arrested and executed.

Sex is not predictive of these skills or attributes, as they vary wildly within a given sex, much more so than the small (though statistically significant) differences, on average, between the sexes.

Nationality? How about literally any other thing that informs beliefs and behaviour? What about other biological traits, like IQ? Skin colour? Straight, gay, or bisexual?

You're making an assessment that this dividing line is the most obvious and the most relevent way to split people up, and I'm saying, I disagree. There isn't actually an answer, this is a philosophical question. The face that your whole world is split between male and female informs so much of your beliefs and behaviour, and I'm just letting you know, for the rest of this, it seems odd to put so much emphasis on it. Your ""us vs them"" is defined by an arbitrarily selected (though factual) difference in sex. I just think its a weird ""us vs them"" to choose.

* Per the office - they will perform the abortion without any requirement for extenuating circumstances after 26 weeks, so if the gestational age is borderline, you should still be fine. 

* The do not bill services globally, they bill charges separately. What this means is that instead of using a single billing code to submit all the charges for everything (the materials, the IV medications, the after care, the medications, the room and board, and the procedure fee for physician and facility) under one code as one line item, they bill it all separately, so that a plan that doesn't cover termination might still cover a lot of the other costs. This is really good news. Your plan will see those claims and it will register like miscarriage management.

* They do require most of the cost upfront, but they will finance some of it if needed, in house

* They will help you contact additional funding assistance, such as through the [National Network of Abortion Funds](http://www.fundabortionnow.org/). They do this for their patients all the time, hopefully that will help as well.

If you can't get the abortion, then she's stuck carrying it to term.

But at that point, since it's going to live anyway and it's not risking her life, she might as well carry it until it's further along, give birth normally, and give it up for adoption then.

If you illegally induce and anything at all goes wrong, and they suspect you tried to abort illegally, she could be charged with murder. It has happened to other women, even when they don't induce on purpose. Late stage miscarriages in the US can trigger criminal investigations and prosecution.

If she takes the abortion pill (the ulcer medication) it will induce a miscarriage, and if so, she must take it near a hospital, and go in saying she's having a miscarriage. There is information about going this route online at www.womenonwaves.org. There is a good chance the baby will survive after birth, at this gestational age, so it would be a crime for her not to provide life saving care, which is why she must go to the hospital. If they discover that the miscarriage was induced, she could prosecuted. This is by far the riskiest way to do this for her, but is also less likely to result in fetal death.

Well it's still legal for you to have a late term abortion in [some states](http://kff.org/womens-health-policy/state-indicator/later-term-abortions/). I actually know a place in CO where she could go, if you need details you can PM me. But idk if you can get there. It's expensive, but it would be much safer for her.

Why did she wait until so late? Especially since you say this was the result of an assault?

3576,"Decision making is neither a sexual characteristic, nor is there evidence that men are even particularly good at it. In fact, there is some evidence to the contrary. 

You and others espouse a belief in extreme sex differences that just aren't there. The vast, vast majority of men and women, on any given measure, fall in an overlapping area where their scores, even on multiple measures, would not be predictive of their sex. Only extremes on either end are confidently distinguishable in lab settings. Even something as basic as height: there is a statistically significant difference in average height for male and female humans. It's real. It's also only a difference of 1.5 inches. That's not much.

 I suspect that you want to be on the extreme male end of the scale on all measures, and seek out partners on the extreme female end. These groups are real, but not at all representative.

I'm an anthropologist, I actually know quite a bit about human and other primate mating behaviour. Your underlying assumptions are often quite misguided. For example - the commonly mistaken belief that female primates give preferential mating rights to alpha males - this is simply untrue. Female chimps and bonobos go out of their way to mate with beta males, who make better partners because they are less aggressive and more nurturing and cooperative.

I could go on but I'll spare you. 

If truly every woman in your life would prefer a male partner who makes all of her choices her (and not because her religion has told her this is the only correct model for sex relations, because indoctrination in a collective delusion doesn't count), then you don't know very many women, or any of them very well.

For my part, I do think penises are quite lovely. I really like my boyfriend's penis, which is curved. I sleep on his left side and it points to me. I like that. Its friendly. I make out with it quite enthusiastically, and pretty much oggle and fondle it whenever his pants are off. I love playing with it. Plus he's a grower, which is SOOO sexy. It's all tiny and adorable when it's sleeping and then massive and rock hard when he's horny.

Sigh.....


He's out of town till tomorrow. Clearly I'm missing him a lot right now.

3653,"&gt; Should I wait for a better time (eg. when I'm in a relationship)?

Don't wait till you're in a relationship, on the off chance that people attribute your orientation to that person and not something about you.

&gt; Things you would have done differently?

I don't honestly remember how I came out to my parents, school friends, or family. I only remember the very first person I told. I told my best friend. I was so terrified. I worked myself up about it all night AND after telling her, felt to uncomfortable to sleep in her bed (I was staying at her house) so I actually slept on the floor. I was 14, it was Spring of 8th grade.

&gt; Things to mention / avoid mentioning at all costs?

Just keep it simple.

&gt; Should I tell my parents first, lest they find out accidentally from people I've already told?

Yes. Together or separately is your call.


&gt; Should I start simple, telling only my closest friend and working things out from there?

This is what I did. After that it got easier and easier. But the thing about presumed straightness is that you will be coming out your whole life. It's not a single process. Some people like to use the facebook blast option because it's easier, but that still leaves every new person you will meet. Coming is out is an ongoing thing, if you want people to know. Some people don't want people to know, or don't think it should matter. Others want to be genuine. Idk. But you're basically never truly out of the closet unless your sexuality because so performative that its obvious (as is the case, you may observe, with some gay men who make it really, really clear that they are gay through voice and behaviour signifiers). Of course, then people would just assume you're gay, lol.

3664,"I'm going to make a suggestion that has proven to work very well for me and my partner, but it's not a direct attack at the sex issue at all.

My suggestion to you is to decide, with your partner, that you two will set aside at least 20 minutes, if not a full hour, just to be alone in bed together every day. No phones unless you are reading something interesting to each other and talking about it. No TV. No facebook. Just you too, together, in bed, physically touching (preferably, with your head on his shoulder or a similar posture that they both enjoy).

Talk about your day. Talk about your plans for the future. Talk about the things you really love about your relationship. Talk about what you miss about your home. Talk about your family. Keep it positive as much as you can, but don't fake it. This is not a time to air major grievances or stir up conflicts, it's not a time to complain. Be genuine and open together. Hug him. Tell him you are glad to be here with him, and you love him, and you are grateful for everything he has done. He should do the same for you. Smile. Tell each other terrible jokes. Read funny buzzfeed lists. Tell crazy stories from your college years and make eachother guess what parts are true and what are made up. Have fun.  Let him tell you about his worries, and tell him about yours. Share.

Basically, set aside time everyday to hop into bed and snuggle and actually be emotionally intimate with each other. You need this: you are drained and cut off from your support system. He's your support system right now, and you need to be his. This is a mutual self-care activity, and it will bring you closer.

Once you have a pocket of time carved out in your lives for intimacy every day, you can start to use that time for sexual intimacy, when you're ready. If you don't keep each other close, and don't have a built in opportunity for it every single day, it's so much harder to initiate it. It will help if the cuddling simply gets more and more flirtatious, and if you make out with him, but make it clear that you might not want to do more than that yet, so he doesn't get all excited and then feel rejected when you aren't ready for more. Set very honest and realistic expectations.

Setting aside time for intimacy (emotional and sexual) is so important, because its a tangible act of prioritizing your relationship. Relationships don't just happen. They require work. This is a part of that work, and if you make the effort, you will be rewarded.

That's my suggestion. Good luck!

YES. This is the thing a lot of girls don't get. Sloppy is better. I think they just don't want to get messy, or they think its gross. And honestly, I get that, if its just some random guy. That *is* gross. But if you're my boyfriend, that's different. You probably shouldn't be with someone if you find their genitals anything other than delicious, or if you can't enjoy getting messy with them. I like the way you put it:

&gt; It would be so hot if a girl just went at it with passion like my cum load was the last food source on earth.

Word. I want my boyfriend to feel like right then at that moment, sucking his dick is the one and only thing I want to do and its amazing and I'm loving every second of it and can't get enough. I try to think of it like I'm snogging his penis. Plus I make it a strict rule that if he asks me for a blowjob, (barring, like, strep throat or something) the answer is not just yes, its HELL YES LETS DO THIS THING!

I also rather insist on being the recepticle for all of his come, so if he's just in the mood to masturbate, I stay in bed with him, and he lets me know when he's getting close so that I can finish him off with with my mouth. No come shall be spilled on my watch! Then I lick him clean after. And ALWAYS swallow. 

My point is, though, that enthusiasm has more than a mechanical purpose. It's psychological, and, of course, orgasms don't happen in your penis: they happen in your brain. 

All of that said - this:

&gt; only using my tongue to swirl around your clit with a gentle suck here and there

That said... I also don't date women. I would. I have. But... it would be complicated.

3706,"[I started writing this reply, and then it kind of go long, so sorry. Thanks for reading, if you do. I'm sure you'll find me hopelessly misguided]

But what would you do with your body? Do you get to eat? If so, does God also resurrect all the micro-organisms that live in and on your body (the gut bacteria, surface yeast, nasal viruses, mouth bacteria) that you need for that? 

What age will we be? Will we all be at our most ""perfect?"" Who decides what that means? 18 and pretty or 80 and wise? What about children? Will this be a world with no children at all? Or the only children will be those who died as children? That's sounds really sad. 

But let's set aside the practical matters.

But more profoundly, what does living mean if you can't die? What kind of meaning does any of it have, if you can't perish, if there is no loss or change? What does love mean, if you can't lose someone? Or have children with them if you want them? Do we still have free will? What would it be like, to never grow old? 

I don't understand what the purpose or meaning would be of a life that never ends, in which all the pleasures and exquisite pains of actually living (eating, having sex, giving birth, falling in love, and yes, even defecating) were taken away. 

It would be like having yourself uploaded onto a robot body that doesn't sleep or eat or need anything, can't really think or decide for itself, and will live forever.

That's not a comforting thought. I would rather stop existing at all than go on in a world like that. 

Besides - everything that you are - everything that makes you a unique individual, is housed in your brain. Consciousness, thought, memory, emotion - these are all organic processes. When the brain turns off, all of that data is lost. So... I always figured that if there was anything after death, that would look like your soul (devoid of anything that makes you you) rejoins a sort of universal spirit. That's what my parents believe (Presbyterian and Catholic who converted to Episcopalian). 

Individuality is what separates us from God, they will tell you. To join the universal spirit and are one with it, we have to give up our individuality. I suppose that's heresy to you though, but I actually think a lot of Christians privately believe something similar. I've encountered them my whole life.

3721,"So, I'm going to attempt a nuanced response to these claims. By no means is what I'm going to discuss intended to reflect all children who experience abuse, I'm just describing a known phenomenon.

Yes, some children do actually seek out attention and affection by acting in sexually inappropriate ways with adult caregivers. This is a known phenomenon. It's often a symptom of some kind of abuse, whether overt (actual molestation) or covert (accidentally seeing pornography and not really understanding the arousal they feel in response). However, it's actually quite common in the general population as well, unless the child is shamed out of it, which is really not a good way to handle it, or appropriate boundaries are set, and they learn to restrain their behaviour to be appropriate.

And children are, unquestionably, sexual beings like you or me. Lets not kid ourselves, or buy into this harmful narrative that children are sexually neutral and continue to perpetuate the ""purity"" narrative which denies children's sexual nature AND shames adolescents for theirs. We are all sexual beings, pretty much from the very beginning. Male and female fetuses are documented to masturbate *in utero*. Infants and toddlers masturbate. Children experiment with peers and siblings not just because they are ""curious"" but because they are legitimately aroused and it feels good. For the same reasons, children sometimes rub up against someone or touch themselves when they are cuddling with adults they are close to in the early years (2-5) because emotional and sexual intimacy feel pretty much the same to them. 

All of this is real, and perfectly normal.

There are whole chapters in co-sleeping parenting books about how to manage the sexual advances of young children toward their (typically but not always) opposite-sex parent, which start to manifest about age 4-6. What to watch for, how to conceptualize the normal, involuntary arousal response *you* might experience, and how to appropriately set boundaries with the child. 

And then the teen years come - and yes, some teenagers legitimately do make sexual advances towards adults in their life. They do. Any teacher in middle or high school can attest to this. They are desperate for affection, they are confusing emotional intimacy with sexual desire, and they are horny all the time. It spills out everywhere. 


This is all real, no one is making it up.


BUT - **So what?** Whether its a 3 year old, or a 13 year old, or an off-limits drunk 33 year old who is behaving inappropriately sexual with you, it doesn't matter. You, the sober, responsible adult, do not give in and seek to gratify your own needs with them! You set appropriate boundaries (there are many approaches to this out there but the best recommend not shaming but simply cutting off physical contact every time it happens, so that they learn what the intimacy limited is, but if needed, you may actually have to address it openly, just be sure you don't shame them!). 

You do not get your rocks off because some young child, or some horny teenager, or your married coworker who drank too much at the Christmas party, pushes some boundaries.

For an example of what I'm talking about - I suggest watching that scene with between Kevin Spacey and Mena Suvari in American Beauty. She is not wanting sexual intimacy, she is seeking a boundary. And she's disappointed and scared to find that he isn't enforcing it. 

Children of all ages push boundaries to learn where the boundaries are. It's our responsibility to enforce them.

So this priest, he's describing something that does happen, claiming way more abuse can be attributed to this kind of reckless opportunism (and thereby ignoring the by far more common narrative, which involves victims being actively groomed by priests to be compliant), and then explaining that his poor brethren just can't help themselves. Well, tough shit.

Of course, if the church didn't require grown men to live in celibacy, pretty much against their will and best interest, effectively removing the right of adult men to make their own choices about their bodies, it would be a lot easier to set appropriate boundaries with parishioners. 

But you know what? It doesn't matter. This is what you signed up for. Either way, these priests are fully culpable. Not because children aren't sexual beings, since they patently are. But because being flirted with by a minor is no excuse AT ALL.",2015-10-08 02:25:47+00:00,cvs269b,1.0,t3_3nvome,24008.0,atheism

If the relationship was open, we would need to close it for a period of time, too.

* Emotionally Cheats: same as above (same caveat as above) if it's truly a romantic affair. If it's just flirtation and he chose to hide it from me, I would be hurt, but we would talk through it, and while I might not be ok with him still flirting with that girl, I wouldn't withdraw the open relationship, if we were in one. If it was serious, I would ask for exclusivity again for a period of time. After the time, I would ask for fidelity for the forseeable future.

* Porn and Masturbation: these are only a problem for me if he's lying about it or hiding it. If it's with me, or part of his private masturbatory life when I'm not there, that's fine. But if he's lying about it, hiding it, *especially* if he lied about after we had talking about and decided it was harming our intimacy and he was *still* doing it - I would probably want to enforce some accountability measures (porn blocks on devices) and lots more time together to try to find other ways to meet his needs, but maybe also therapy for him alone (not about porn, but for mental health and stress reduction). I basically have no problem with masturbation at all, but if masturbating makes it so we can't have sex later, and that happens all the time, that's a real problem.

* Flirts with other girls: since I don't really mind if he does this, I wouldn't he upset if it was just happening while I'm not around.

Here is my take on the issue. Not that you asked, but here you go. 

1) We live in a non-magical, material universe, right? I mean, things happen for reasons. No one is sending lightning bolts down on us for saying naughty words. It's pretty clear that illnesses are not the result of being a bad person. It's all just probability.

2) Everything about who we are (our consciousness, thoughts, memories, emotions, habits, fears, everything) is organic. It happens in the brain. And once the brain dies, all of that data is simply lost forever. Which means that you, and I, and every other person who has ever lived, is mortal. There is no soul, or if there is, that soul has nothing to do with who you are. You exist inside your own head only.

So - if a God is not acting on the world today, AND if there is no other world after this one, then..... God's existence (one or many of them) is functionally irrelevant. ",2015-10-07 18:28:26+00:00,cvrjxoa,3.0,t1_cvrjld2,488.0,exchristian

3740,"Yeah, it's probably not advisable if she is going to get really upset about it. Hurting people's feelings doesn't help, and attacking people's delusions directly is rarely effective.

I think the best way to stay sane through all of this is to recognize what their motivations for trying to re-convert you are, and choosing which one to validate. Generally, (and I'm speaking very generally here as an anthropologist talking about group think and the dynamics of inclusion and indoctrination), there are two motivations for any act - a selfish one and and altruistic one. Example: I give you half of my sandwich. Altuistically, I'm sharing because you are hungry. Selfishly, I'm investing in our relationship, ensuring you'll hopefully share with me in the future, and preserving the cohesion of the group.

So, lets look at the people in your family reaching out to you to try to re-convert you:

1) Altruistically, they are genuinely concerned that you have fallen away from the one true path to immortality, and that you will be punished. They love you, and they don't want that for you.

2) Selfishly, they are seeking validation for their own beliefs through trying to convert you to them. This reinforces their beliefs and then makes them feel more secure as part of the in-group (in this case, the group of true believers). Your falling away (especially if you are actually doing well in life) and our reasons for it cause cognitive dissonance and they seek to counter that with continued self-re-indoctrination.

So...... which of these are you going to focus on? You can focus on the absurdity of self-enforced indoctrination, the obvious fear and circular logic, and the unwillingness or inability to truly listen to anything you have to say because to really consider it might dislodge deeply held beliefs. 

Or, you could focus on the fact that they do actually love you, and just want you to be ok.

3741,"No. A child should definitely NOT be put on trial in a courtroom. The should be approached with love and with professional care to help them. A trial is about establishing guilt.

Clearly you are not a parent. 

Once again, where are these specific terms coming from, and what does that have to do with inpatient psychiatric care? 

&gt; kidnapping

Having an officer escort the child in your custody to a facility to hand over custody to them is not kidnapping. Kidnapping of a child is when you unlawfully take a child away from the custody of the parent without permission.

3743,"&gt; You may have never been told it was a sin but were you expressly told it wasn't a sin? Was it ever even discussed?

Of course! I was explicitly told masturbation is not a sin. Its doesn't hurt anyone, and it's good for you. It would be the most arbitrary and pointless rule. 

&gt; the way 1 Corinthians 7 talks about how our spouse owns our body

I don't accept that this reading applies a) before marriage or b) to the exclusion of your own autonomy. Not all people will marry. 

&gt; self pleasing action that achieves a goal that the Bible expressly gives as our spouse's responsibility

Yeah, sorry, I don't think that's a healthy way to live, and because I don't accept biblical inerrancy, I'm perfectly comfortable considering the biblical guidelines to be nothing more than guidelines, not positive injunctions that are meant to apply to all people forever. We know a lot more now about human behaviour, human sexuality, and what produces the best outcomes for people in this life. Clearly, if you are married, opting to fap alone by yourself instead of engaging with your partner is unhealthy for both of you. That's good advice. But to say we should never, ever masturbate is absurd. Most women, for example, will never acheive orgasm through sex or with the help of anyone else unless they practice hard at it by themselves because it's a real challenge for us. Its *good* for your marital sex life to have a private masturbatory life. 

There is nothing wrong with pleasing yourself. We are alive in amazing bodies on an amazing planet and we only get ONE CHANCE to live and enjoy it. We do have work to do here - we should be improving the lived experience of those around us. But that doesn't preclude truly living and loving being alive, and sexuality is one really beautiful way to experience that. All this sex-shaming is pointless, imo, and the remnants of older cultural norms, not transcendent truths. 

So sure, if you deeply believe that masturbation is wrong and you feel horrible about it afterwards, then you should probably refrain. But you don't *have* to feel that way. And it's ok if you don't.

I think we could do with a lot less sexuality policing and sexual asceticism and a lot more joy and exuberance and love.

3789,"&gt; Does there even have to be a supernatural element to existance?

Nope. This was the first part of my shelf that broke. I was still willing to hold on to a god belief long after this, but when I was 12, after learning the reasoning behind the reason we define death as brain death, I concluded consciousness is just an organic phenomena, and nothing of our ""selves"" survives death. 

Besides, mammalian death is an essential part of the life cycle of many other organisms, and death of living things generally is a fundamental part of healthy ecosystems. They idea that there would be anything wrong about death is absurd. What would the micro-organisms eat? What would become compost for trees to draw nutrients from? Its only because humans think they are special and want to be different, that they invent a mythology of immortality. And that is the origin of all religions.

3800,"&gt; death

This is one that I understand, but don't relate to. I came to the conclusion that death was final and the afterlife was a story we tell ourselves to feel better about loss, at about age 12. I still believed in parts of Christianity, just not the afterlife and resurrection stuff, which wasn't that important to me anyway. Honestly, I think that human consciousness is an organic phenomena and when the brain stops functioning, all the data is lost and we cease to exist. Which means your dad stopped existing the day he died.

But, you know, there are non-Christians who believe in an afterlife, whether as part of another religious tradition or just because they choose to hold on to this idea in some way because it comforts them. If you know its irrational and choose to do it anyway, that's your prerogative. I cross my fingers sometimes when I'm about to run a yellow light. It's irrational, but it makes me feel a little better.

However, if the floor has dropped out of the afterlife for you, that doesn't mean that your dad is utterly erased from memory. He lived here for some period of time. You remember him. You honour that memory by living up to the expectations he set for you, being a loving, generous, thoughtful person. Making the most of your time on earth, and taking every opportunity to tell people that you love them. In this way, you keep his legacy alive, even if you will never again see him. 

My cousin lost his dad when he was 10, to a cancer he shouldn't have gotten, for which there was no cause and no effective long term treatment. 

&gt; a disconnect in my identity

So here is the thing - you beliefs and opinions are not you. They are things that serve you, but they are not who you are. You are the rational mind inside who can pick up a new belief and drop an old one when it no longer serves you, or no longer makes rational sense to you. So letting go of your beliefs doesn't need to mean completely uprooting your identity.

Now, regarding your choice of time spent - these are admirable ways to give back to your community, and there are other admirable ways that you can do that, which are not strictly bible-study related. You could volunteer at the YMCA, or read to the elderly, or become a museum docent, or lead activities and home-work help for kids after school. You could start a book club. You could start a camping/hiking club and go on adventures in the outdoors. You could work at a food bank, or a shelter, or as a guardian for women entering abortion clinics, to protect them vitriolic protesters. There are any number of ways you can continue to live an ethical life, giving back to others, that simply isn't strictly about bible study and which (imho) is of greater value anyway.


&gt; what if I'm wrong

The chances that you are wrong are quite slim. Its not impossible, it's just highly, highly improbable. In the same way that it's highly, highly improbably that your cat is a spy for the CIA. Sure, it could be true, but......... the slight chance doesn't make it worth drowning the cat and moving to Ulaan Baatar, does it?

Meanwhile, we're all just here living life. Spend your life being a good, charitable, loving person, and when you come to the end of your road, and it's time to say goodbye, trust that you will either slip away and cease to exist, or, maybe, possibly, some benevolent force out there will embrace you and welcome you home.

Also, when I was 18, my bf was 27. Great friend of mine to this day. We were only together that one year, then I moved away. No regrets. Couldnt have made it throgh freshman year without him. I was experiencing my first onset of bipolar, i would have killed myself had i not had a support system. He also taught me everything I know about baseball, and introduced me to lots of cool films, poets, short story writers, and gave me my first Philip Roth novel. We were together that whole year, but non-exclusive, and that spring i started also sometimes hooking up with the next guy, see below.

That same year I slept with a professor (i was 19, he was 37). No regrets at all. He actually turned me on to my eventual major (anthropology), taught me everything I know about anal sex, introduced me to role-playing and power exchange (not my thing really but it was for a while, and it's good to experiment!) and introduced me to lots of cool films, books, and music. Also, he wasn't my professor anymore when I started dating him, and there was no other rule getting in the way.


I think if I had viewed any of these as potential long-term romantic partners, and not just cool friends that I enjoyed sleeping with, I'm pretty sure it might have been harder on me.

* You could tell the truth. Not the shorter version, that you don't want to do this, but a careful but truthful examination of what you actually believe, and why you are still choosing to go forward with this process. I like this option best, because it allows you to complete the assignment and retain your integrity.

-----------------------

Here is what I would say, roughly outlined, if I was opting for option 3:

* Why do you want to be confirmed at this time?

I want to be confirmed because this is the conclusion of this course of study, which I have committed time and effort to completing over the last [however many] weeks/months. I have taken time out of my life to read and reflect on the biblical text, and [other things you had to do]. Having completed this course of study, I would like to graduate, which will validate the effort and commitment I have made. 

I have also committed to joining my parents religious organization because I am part of their household and these are their wishes, and I choose to respect those wishes. [Insert reference to 10 commandments if you like]. Out of respect for my family, and their beliefs, I have chosen to embark on this course of study, and I would like to be confirmed as a member of the adult church body, which they desire for me to do.

Do not feel called to take this step by anyone or anything, but I feel regardless that is it the right thing to do at this time, and have chosen to go forward with the ritual process because it is an important part of transitioning into adulthood in our church culture. This ritual process is respected and validated by people whom I love and respect, and the result will be full adult membership in an organization in which I was raised, and which will confer on me the respect and status of an adult member.

* How do you plan to live out your faith, in concrete ways, in the next couple of years? 

I plan to live out my beliefs and values in the following ways [notice, I rephrased the question there a bit]. [This part is going to depend on your actually deeply held beliefs. I'm just going to give you some of mine]. 

One of my most deeply held beliefs is that all people are worthy of equal rights and dignity under the law. [Insert ""love others / treat others as you would have them treat you"" reference if desired]. I will therefore commit my time, talent, and treasure to promoting laws that protect children from neglect and starvation, and which provide for the basic needs of the most vulnerable among us. I will also support equal rights and reproductive freedoms for women, by joining fundraising efforts in support of planned parenthood, and volunteering to be an escort for women who are endangered as they try to obtain essential reproductive healthcare. 

One of my core values is to stand up for the oppressed and marginalized [insert Jesus reference if desired]. For me, this looks like supporting equal rights and freedoms for LGBT persons here and abroad. I plan to join the LGBT Allies clubs where I can find them, and start one if I cannot find one, to put my own safety and reputation on the line to offer a safe haven for those who are alone and suffering persecution for their orientation or gender identity. I will use my privilege as a [fill in here - straight male, upper middle class female, etc etc] to speak out against discrimination and further the cause for the less privileged among us.

I also believe that, as a human, I am endowed with the faculties of curiosity and reason, and that the best thing to do with these is to use them. In doing so, I have concluded that the universe is knowable through scientific investigation, and so I plan to use my talents and resources to promote greater scientific literacy for others. I plan to major in Biology and teach high school students [or something similarly applicable]. I plan to use my talents to share with others the amazing wonders of the natural world, to inspire curiosity and equip them with critical thinking skills so that they can do great things for human kind, and improve the quality of life, in this life, for our fellow human beings.

If, at the end of this, you have written a thoughtful examination of your personal beliefs and how you plan to live them concretely in your life, with or without passing references to any portions of Christianity which you find acceptable (if any), then your pastor may decide that your answers are inadequate, and may decline to confirm you, but no one can say that this is because you are being selfish, not trying hard enough, or are being deliberately disruptive or disrespectful to the process, to your parents, or to the institution. You are answering honestly. If these answers are not enough, then you also have a document you can refer your parents to should they have questions, and one which demonstrates that, while you might not be a believer, you are an ethically driven person with a guiding moral compass and a sense of purpose in the world.

Maybe not, but this is one diagnosis that almost everyone agrees should result in an abortion.

That's one reason why it needs to be available for people who need it.

Because it seems like that accomplishes both objectives: mine is to permit any woman to become unpregnant at any time for any reason, and yours is to preserve the life of the fetus once it's old enough to survive with medical intervention. Inducing labour with the intention of preserving the life of the fetus (except in cases where it will obviously die, like anacephaly, or in cases where it is killing her, like that poor woman in Ireland who's miscarriage was incomplete and instead of killing the fetus to save her, they did nothing and they both died). This would strain the healthcare system and it would be expensive, but we would learn a lot more about how to deliver and save preemies. 

The difficultly will be picking a cut off time, but I think that's easier to get around by simply saying you can abortion up to 20 weeks, and deliver after 24 (when the 3rd trimester actually starts) and the intervening 2-4 weeks are simply restricted to just in order to save the mothers life. It's not likely we will ever be able to improve survival rates for pre-24 week deliveries, at least not in our life-times.

 I just don't see the point in being ""tough"" on girls who get pregnant. But that's because I fundamentally don't care that their decision terminates a life. You clearly do. I dont, because I think that it doesn't matter where that life comes from, it still isn't entitled to suck out her bodily resources to grow itself. She has a right to sever that connection.

Your complete lack of sympathy for her circumstances is typical though. But women who keep babies they don't want live to regret it bitterly, and the children suffer tremendously. And adoption outcomes are scarcely ideal. Everyone suffers when an unwanted child is born.

People make bad choices and take stupid risks. Those shouldn't prevent them from moving on with their lives, especially when those shared bad choices disproportionately affect one sex and not the other. Women can never have equity without reproductive freedom, which is why women have practiced birth control, abortion, and even infanticide, unimpeded, for much of human history, going back 200k years. 

Women will continue to obtain abortions no matter what restrictions are placed. They are just more likely to die as a result. But perhaps you're ok with that, since they deserve it, for not ""keeping their legs closed?""

And 60% of women who need an abortion at already mothers with one or more children at home. These are not people with a lot of disposable income or free time. Who will watch the kids while they drive a 500 miles to the nearest clinic and stay over night?

Many women do not menstruate every 4 weeks, or have break through bleeding throughout their pregnancy. Others are young and stupid because of terrible education, and actually don't know what the signs of pregnancy are. If you don't find out that you are pregnant until you are 10 weeks along, 2 weeks is not enough time to save up $800, or even $400, if you are barely scraping by. Especially is any other issue comes up (car breaks down, kid gets sick, job loss). 

The truth is, you are deciding on her rights based on your evaluation of her worthiness. That's a problem. We don't exclude people from cancer care because they smoked when they were younger. We don't refuse to treat a broken leg because someone decided to risk injury by skiing. And you are not there to truly understand or consider all the possible circumstances that led to the situation they are in. Late term abortions might be accessed in case that you disapprove of, but they are absolutely necessary in some cases. 

Of course - cheap and easily accessible early abortion (like, in a single visit, no onerous paperwork, no lectures, no vaginal probe, just walk in, take a pill, go home, take the second pill, and done) would solve all of this. As would cheaper and even more easily accessible morning after pills. 

It shocks me what a big deal people make out of abortion in this country. I didn't grow up here and I don't get it. We should be encouraging all sexually active young women to use long-acting BC (like IUDs) and make is as easy and inexpensive as possible for them to have an abortion in that first trimester, because it's better for her, too.

My grandparents cannot stand sleeping in the same bed, so pretty much since they were in their 30s they have been sleeping in twin beds in their bedroom. His is hard and he uses lots of blankets, goes to bed at 9pm and gets up around 5am. Her bed is cushy and has a feather comforter that she sleeps on top of, and she uses a light sheet and goes to bed at midnight and wakes up no earlier than 9:30 or 10am. They've been married 58 years and raised 4 children together. It has worked out well for them.

As for me.... my partner and I live apart during the week so we are apart for 4-5 nights anyway. When we are together (weekends, holidays, and several weeks during the summer) we sleep in the same bed for the most part. Occasionally I will be unable to sleep, and will end up going to sleep on the floor of my daughter's room on a sleeping bag. Once in a blue moon I'll stay up drinking and pass out in the living on a chair in my clothes with all the lights on..... lol.

But apart from those instances, I pretty much always share the bed when I'm there. That's really only possible, though, because he falls asleep before me, so he doesn't hear my snoring. He often wakes up before I do, though, and reads in bed and occasionally pokes me if the snoring gets bad. Apparently that does the trick.

But 80% of abortions are just taking an ulcer pill and inducing muscarriage, which is just shedding the uterine lining and anything that attached to it. That's just a withdrawal of resources. 

Regarding the other 20% - since, currently, removing the source of the nutrients will inevitably cause the fetus to die, I don't think it actually matters how the removal is accomplished. The end result is the same.

In fact, if it was commonplace for people to wake up hooked up to other people in the hospital, and they were free to sever that connection, I think the process would be similar - knowing that person would die and there was nothing else to do, a medical professional would sedate and euthanize prior to or during the process of severing the connection. Seems perfectly reasonable. I wouldn't stab him. But I am also not administering or cleaning out the abortion, either, a doctor is.

A little redness is normal, just not angry redness that comes with inflammation. I don't see any inflammation here (swelling that stretches the surface of the skin but is not directly the result of, say, a pocket of infection below the surface). 

If you can afford it and you are worried about it, and symptoms persist for more than two weeks or get worse, see a primary care physician or a dermatologist. My guess is that by 5-7 days from now, it will very visibly ready to burst and release pus, or will begin to subside on its own without bursting, and one way or another it will be resolved in about 10 more days.

The bodily autonomy argument holds water. It's true, you don't have the right to drink and drive because it would endanger other people. But if you did, and someone was critically injured and you were the only organ donor match available and without your kidney she would die, you still could not be forced to sustain her by giving her your kidney. 

If you woke up in the hospital next to someone who was connected by a tube to your blood supply and needed that connection to live, it would be your right to sever that connection and leave the hospital, because it's your body and your bodily resources.

A human is not an incubator. That means two things. 1) it's means she is more than just a function, but 2) the fetus does not grow *on its own*. It gets everything - all of its oxygen, all of nutrients, all of the cellular material it needs to grow, by sucking it out of the host body by force. It leaches them from her, sucking the calcium from her bones, pulling out the oxygen, fat, sugar, protein, essential vitamins, and other nutrition she needs. Every single time a cell divides, every one of those billions of cell divisions, is not because the cells have grown bigger by themselves. They grown large enough to contain enough material to be able to assemble 2 sets of everything and split because each one has been sucking up and hoarding her bodily resources. And it sends out signals into her body that cause her joints to weaken, her hormones to start changing, her hair and nails to grow differently, and sometimes causes auto-immune flare up or any number of dangerous complications. It manipulates her body into prioritizing the embryo/fetus over her own welfare. The female body doesn't ""nourish"" the pregnancy voluntarily, it is forced into compliance by hormones sent by the embryo/fetus to cross the normal signals and override her system. Even before the fertilized egg implants, the eggs follicle, left behind in her ovary, starts to send hormonal signals intended to manipulate her body into helping it fulfill it's objective. It's a complex organism, a tiny force to be reckoned with, a cunning invader. 

She is not ethically requires to provide any of those resources or services just because it has implanted itself and demands them. She has a right to withdraw life support from the embryo/fetus and keep the contents of her body, her bodily resources, for herself, because they are hers.

You legally can't waive it here. 


Also, at-fault divorce is definitely still a thing. It's just not the only option anymore. Though in our case, it applies, since he was both violent and unfaithful, and the process resulted in a protective order.

I'm not screwed now, and I wouldnt be screwed with his income added. It would just be more affordable. Besides, if he was still part of the household and earning the minimum wage (which, again, is probably way less than he actually makes) most of that would become disposable income for the household since I manage to get my income to cover most of the costs anyway. So no, we'd be much better off with an extra 15-20k in household income per year. Contributing 3k a year is really minor, comparatively, but would still really help.

3939,"I've sucked it up to see therapist who strongly disagree with me on things that matter (ie - an anti-choice therapist, when I needed to talk about how much I regret having a kid) because I just needed to say the words, and her opinion didn't matter as much to me as the liberation of talking.

Also, if this is crisis intervention for something like mania, severe depression, suicidality, drug relapse, self-harm, major life transition, etc, or if seeing them is a condition of staying on psychiatric medications, then a professional, even a misguided one, is better than none.

The other part of this is that this provider may or may not actually be a believer, but may have come to believe (whether by training, exposure to 12-step programs, experience in their practice, etc) that people who believe in a higher power are more likely to be successful in therapy, and will have better outcomes. They may believe that the OPs atheism is a symptom like suicidality, and indeed, losing faith in a God for a temporary time is a really strong indicator of a serious psychological disturbance, and often a return to faith has a restorative effect on those individuals (in that they stop cheating, self-harming, drinking, whatever). Those people go right back to being believers and remain happy in their little bubble, reassured in their faith. The belief that this is the only possible positive outcome is clearly misguided but probably not unfounded in at least anecdotal evidence. 

Of course, I'm personally assuming the OP simply is an atheist, that this is utterly unrelated to the mental healthcare needs in question. All the more reason to set a boundary.

There is always be something you don't like about your therapist. And yes, this doesn't sound like a long term solution. But the practice of actually getting organized and going and taking care of yourself, even if the content of those sessions remains really surface, about healthy coping, etc, it's still potentially good for you.

3944,"Well, we actually have no idea how much money he makes because he works under the table. For all I know he makes more than I do. We agreed on basing it on minimum wage as a concession during the divorce.

I spend about 70% of my own income to support my child, and he has spent 0% of his, and yet wants to retain some legal rights that restrict our future and freedoms. $12,000 over 4 years would have meant $3,000 per year, or $250 a month. That sounds like a lot until you actually consider the cost of providing for a child. Her preschool tuition alone has been $12,000-$14,000 per year. Including health insurance, clothes, food, additional rent for a larger apt, and other expenses, it's about $20,000-$25,000 a year to provide for her. Now that she's older and I have to find summer day programs to keep her for 3 months out of the year in addition to school, it's more like $30,000 (this summer, I spend about $7,000 just so I can have the privilege of working all day to pay for us to live). Per year. So if he actually paid what was ordered, it would make up a mere 10% of her costs. That's pretty miniscule. 

Also, I live in Texas, where as long as you make any payment, any payment at all, you can avoid jail and fees. He would need to pay me like $20 a month every 6 months and couldn't be put in jail. He hasn't. It's been years. He spends $20 a week on Starbucks. 

So, nope, I don't feel sorry for him. This is a completely avoidable situation for him. 

I would waive all the fees if he will let me change her name to mine, move out of the state, and have full custody. He doesn't visit her, he's not even allowed to have custody himself, only supervised visitation, which he doesn't use more than 2-3 times a year when his family arranges it.

Nor is monogamy a terrible mistake. Did you not read my post at all? Of course perfect compliance would result in positive outcomes for many. There would be a large chunk of the population for whom monogamy is a significant challenge, though, because it's definitely not something that comes naturally to them.

That doesn't mean it's not a worthwhile approach. I just don't think asking for compliance to a set of rules and shaming non-compliance to the exclusion of any other methods is not an effective way to improve outcomes. Nor is it a realistic expectation that people will comply universally.

Lets set aside the bi-erasure for a second to note that even hacks promoting long-discredited junk science don't think it's possible to 100% eliminate attraction.


&gt; your dangerous posts could lead some Christians to just shrug and say ""Well, my pedophilia or my friends pedophilia is just hard-wired in.""

What part of realizing you have a permanent and serious condition would make you shrug your shoulders? I wouldn't. I would be terrified, and learning that no amount of prayer or will power could cure me, I would immediately seek professional help, instead of hiding in fear and hoping I never act on it. 

I'm trying to encourage people to seek help, not for a magical cure, but for maintenance care for a serious permanent condition, so that it prevents harm to others.

The person to whom I was responding when I made the remark that so troubled. He suggested that Romans 12 tells us that faith can cause a ""supernatural mental transformation"" and I said that that's not an effective way to treat pedophilia, in the same way that it would not be effective at treating any other disorder, including cancer.

I'm comparing pedophilia to *all other medical conditions,* cancer is just an easy stand-in. It's something we don't blame people for, even if they smoked their way into it, because plenty of people get it for absolutely not reason at all. 

But sure - how about type I diabetes? Potentially very harmful if left untreated, but safer if you treat it. Also not curable, just manageable.

How about bipolar disorder? Also something you are probably born with, might be influenced by other factors like trauma in your upbringing, also potentially harmful to you and others around you, and requires life long maintenance care.

Do you see what I'm saying?

Show me one study of treatment options for pedophiles where even 20% were cured. That's still an F, but hey, even 20% is pretty great! Show me any study, any treatment, that has cured pedophilia.

&gt; one you can fight against by your actions and thoughts 

Of course we want people to choose not to act on their attractions.  Refraining from acting on it doesn't ""cure"" the attraction. Pedophilia is an attraction, not an action.

And for a sexual compulsive, pure repression (without therapy, group support, sometimes medication) has disastrous results. People who struggle with addiction, or sexual compulsion, require medical intervention. Do you not understand the nature of a compulsion? No matter how much you want to stop, you can't do it *without help.* Telling people to just will it away with faith is what's dangerous. Those are the people who will end up offending. That's what we tell child abusing priests when we ask them to pray and move them to a new parish for a fresh start. It never addresses the underlying issues, and continues to give them access to children whom they can abuse. No amount of praying and faith will stop them. They need to choose professional help and they need to be removed from access to children and positions of authority. 

The people who accept that they have a condition that is dangerous, and seek medical help to treat it and prevent harmful behaviours, are more likely not to hurt other people. Accepting that you have a condition is not the same thing as treating it like its ok. Its a serious chronic condition that requires professional intervention and routine maintenance in order to prevent adverse consequences.

Do a little research.

The neural networks that control sexual arousal are established early and remain exceptionally difficult to alter even a tiny bit. And some kinds of sexual orientation appear to be determined even earlier than that - before birth, though there appears to be more than one possible cause. In the case of pedophilia, there appear to be other possible causes, too, though potentially these are epigenetic (inciting events or circumstances activate potential for pedophilia that was already inborn and may have manifested regardless, or might not have, its hard to know). For the most part, these are permanent characteristics that cannot be altered. 

So you have to find a way to go on and live a joyful and productive life and not harm anyone. That's doable. Treating it like something evil that must be excised doesn't help *at all* and if anything, results in less compliance and more offending.

That's true of non-pedophile child sex-offenders too. Indeed, that's true for pretty much everyone, whether the issue is mental and behavioural health, or simply cancer.

Most adults in a normal population (about 51% female) will successfully pair off if they want to, but there will always be people who simply won't because, again, we're not a monogamous species, and there will always be people in the 7+ billion population who opt out of partnership or who opt for multiple marriages simply because they can and want to. So sure, at any given moment there may be single people, but since marriage is not limited within your own generation even, or your own sex, or a static permanent condition, its reasonable to suggest that at some point in their lives, every person could be happily monogamously partners, even with the sex imbalance.

And please note - I am not saying we should throw up our hands because it's hard, I'm just trying to talk about what actually works to reduce these adverse effects, and what doesn't. And denying certain aspects of how human sexuality has evolved is not productive toward that end.

------------

Sure - if humans were actually monogamous like penguins, and mated only to reproduce, and only mated with a single mature partner, then yeah, we wouldn't have STDs or rape or any of it. But we simply are not a monogamous species. We can choose to live monogamously, but we aren't made that way. Nor is sex made for procreation, in humans. If it were, it would only be possible to have sex during ovulation, and no one would ever want to or even be able have sex outside of that period. That's how it is for most sexually reproducing species. But that's clearly not the case for humans. And that's not about ""lust,"" its about a biological drive to be sexually intimate throughout our lives. We evolved to be this way. We also evolved to have about 5-10% of the population attracted to the same sex exclusively, and about 30% of the population attracted to both sexes. Also not conducive to reproduction or monogamy.

So what we have is a species that has evolved to favour and rely on non-monogamous and non-reproductive sexual behaviour, and a set of rules that could reduce potential harm from those behaviours. Universal compliance could produce some of these results, but universal compliance is impossible because people who are acting out of addiction or compulsion are not acting of their own free will and are not able to control their behaviours with will-power alone. No amount of wanting or trying to comply will make them compliant. They need medication, therapy, support, etc. 

Holding up an ideal and shaming non-compliance does little to support people who actually need help and intervention when it comes to things like infidelity, pornography, inappropriate sexual acting out, and sex abuse. 

Yes, if people limit the number of partners they have, and choose to live in monogamy and to respect other's bodily autonomy AND practice near universal birth control (because nothing about monogamy prevents unwanted pregnancy) then we reduce some of these problems.

You might even talk one of them into providing a lift here ans there. Eventually, one of them will offer to introduce you to their nieces or grandkids or neighbours. Take them up on it. Take every invitation you get. Build yourself a social network of people who know you and like you because you show up to the bingo night every week and visit afterwards and ask about their kids and their various ailments.

4023,"Your question seems to be two-fold: 

* What does an atheist wedding look like? 

and 

* What does an atheist marriage look like? 

These are definitely not the same thing. 

A wedding is a ritual process that lasts anywhere from a few hours to several days and demarcates a shift in the nature of a relationship from informal to formal, generally speaking, and is practiced in most cultures in some form. Some places have local or state classifications for alternate relationships that are formalized by default - these are typically referred to as ""common law"" marriages. The time one would need to be together varies across jurisdictions around the world, but its typically only available in countries that do not have a state religion. 

A marriage is a legal partnership (can be egalitarian or hierarchical) that takes place following the formalization of a relationship between two people, and persists for some length of time, and generally needs to be formally disbanded in order for either person to enter into another marriage with another person, though that's not universally true (for example, during the practice of polygyny and polyandry.) 

In many places, a civil marriage requires only paper documentation and the swearing of a standard oath declaring the intention to be wed to one's partner, officiated by an agent of the state and witnessed by one or more legal witnesses to the contract. This can take place in the court house, but can also occur in a private setting or in the company of a large number of guests. Generally, the officiant needs to either be ordained or be licensed to act as a secular agent of the state. This is for regulatory reasons.

An atheist wedding could look a lot like a traditional religious wedding, but it needn't. It's all a matter of how much tradition matters to you. I, personally, plan to marry ""in the round"" (that is, with seating arranged in a circle and with no center aisle). We plan to eliminate a lot of the traditions - I won't, for example, be handed off by my patriarch. However, I do plan to incorporate one old tradition from pre-Christian Germany, where the spouses together sever a wooden log as a symbol of the hard work involved in marriage as a partnership. We plan to have it set up like a year ahead of time and have all the people in our lives who want to, help us get it down to just a few cuts left by the day of the ceremony. We are not sure about an officiant. We will probably use a secular official at the court house by ourselves, but we still plan to have a ceremony in front of friends and family. We just aren't sure if that ceremony will have an officiant. We're thinking more a few musical contributions, maybe a poem, and then we exchange vows we have written together (they will be exceptionally sparse and to the point, most likely) and then - party time! I'm planning on a bonfire in the woods and lots of booze. 

An atheist marriage can similarly look like a religious marriage. There are some atheists who subscribe to sex and gender dichotomy and who believe there is an evolutionary basis for hierarchical relationship structures. These people are generally incorrect in their understanding and application of evolutionary theory, but they do exist and their marriages are certainly not religious, but may look a lot like  a religious one. On the other hand, the majority of atheists, I would think, would not fall into this category, and would opt generally for an egalitarian marriage, which means that there is no default head or leader of the relationship, and people just work together or takes turns leading as needed. That is my preferred model. ",2015-09-28 21:08:25+00:00,cvhc16l,1.0,t3_3mqisp,6629.0,atheism

4033,"There is at least one piece of salient advice in the bible - do not allow yourself to be ""unequally yoked."" The advice is directed to christians, encouraging them to marry other christians. But this is true for all of us.

It is not a good idea to make a lifelong commitment to someone whose beliefs are so utterly incompatible with your own. You are right, he may become more religious. But you may yourself because much more irreligious. You say the bible is ""a bit sexist"" - that makes me think you haven't really even skimmed the surface of the sexism, homophobia, misogyny. If you were to marry, it would probably need to be in the orthodox church in order for it to count for him and his family, which would mean you would need to convert. Are you willing to do that for him? 

You should be looking for a partner who is compatible with you, believes some of the same core things that you all do, and wants what you want. If you don't want to give away 10% or your income (or, really, just 10% of his income, and 0% of yours, but still, that's a lot) to an organization that you don't support, then that's a pretty major difference of opinion. 

If you can't agree on things like what happens after death, whether marriages should be egalitarian or hierarchical, what to teach your children about sexual morality, science, religion, etc, and if you cannot agree on thins as essential as the reasons why bad things happen, and the very nature of the universe, how can you imagine being with them at all?

4081,"You can ""disagree"" that those abortions wouldn't take place, but that doesn't change the fact that they do. In Texas, people are still accessing abortion, they are just ordering the drugs online, or driving over to other states or to mexico, where it is also illegal but still easier to obtain. It might cause a temporary reduction until people figure out alternatives, but then there will immediately be a booming market for back alley abortion and it will be way worse than before. In the 60s, you had to know someone you could ask about it. Now? With the internet and dark net, it is already really easily to learn everything you need to know about how to induce a miscarriage so that you can go to the hospital and have them treat you with a D&amp;C to prevent sepsis. 

What happens next? Miscarriage becomes a reason to be suspicious of criminal activity. Next thing you know, women are being interrogated after losing pregnancies that they wanted, and then more restrictions are placed on the behaviour of pregnant women. Behaviour that could endager the embryo/fetus is criminalised. That's drugs and drinking, but why stop there? Driving and crossing the road are dangerous too. So is shell-fish. So are some kinds of physical exertion. Even swimming in the ocean. Next thing you know, 3rd trimester bed-rest is no longer recommended but legally monitored for high risk patients. All pregnant women are tox-screened, and have breathalizers installed throughout their homes, cars, and lives. That's too invasive! People will cry. So then, in the guise of the woman's and child's best interest, supervision will be outsourced to the medical industry. Women will need to check themselves in to birthing wards months in advance and have their movements monitored and meals and medications supervised. Pretty soon, mandatory pregnancy testing for all women to preserve every possible pregnancy, even though 50% of pregnancies end in miscarriage anyway. 

This is what happens when you start policing women's bodies and treating them like a means of production and not fully independent adults. And if women are facing that level of scrutiny and invasion and control, and the serious career and financial consequences of a pregnancy that is monitored by the state, MORE, not fewer, will opt for illegal abortions, and they also won't go to the hospital for aftercare, and will instead die. 

And you say you favour a ""small government."" A government that has the power to reach into your doctor's office and control your choices for your own body and life is not small by any measure at all.

4085,"But a merger of state and church would only benefit you if the church in question was your own church, don't you see? Your flare says Eastern Orthodox. Possibly, you would be open-minded enough to accept a Catholic or some kinds of Protestant churches as the ruling church, but you would definitely encounter a lot of issues. What if the government proscribed how you could worship, and prevented you from attending an EO service? Disbanded the churches and church-run organizations, or taxed and penalized them for not being the approved denomination? What if you, personally, had a harder time getting a job in government or any public sector job like teaching because you didn't attend an approved congregation? What if those prejudices were enshrined within ""religious freedom"" laws that made it possible for anyone - a store owner, a private sector employer, a coffee shop owner, a rental association - to refuse your business and fire you based on the fact that you are EO. 

And then there are churches like mine. I'm Episcopalian - many of us support many of the things that other Christians hate: marriage equality, reproductive freedom, married clergy, gay clergy, women clergy to the highest levels of leadership. Would you want us in charge? Would that frustrate your identity as a christian to have a ""christian government"" that stood for things you don't agree with? Because that's how I feel whenever so-called Christians advocate things I believe to be extraordinarily unethical, like banning birth control. I believe a position against BC and abortion is absolutely morally indefensible. I'm sure you feel the opposite. But both of our denominations are Christian, are they not?

And that's just assuming that it's still a Christian government. What happens when major demographic changes occur, and a Jewish, Islamic, or Buddhist government takes the place of the Christian one?

Trust me. If you want to have the right to attend whatever church you like and vote for whatever civil policies you like without suffering other consequences to your personal and professional life, and if you want to ensure that your denomination is safe from persecution, you have to afford other people the same rights (treat others as you would have them treat you) and preserve the separation. Secular government is the *only way* to protect the freedom to practice your faith and teach it to your children.

For example, criminalizing abortion doesn't decrease abortions. It just guarantees that more women will die of unsafe, illegal ones.

Funding comprehensive sex ed and free or low-cost long-term birth control has been shown to raise the age of first sexual intercourse, and reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies. Teaching ""abstinence only"" actually *lowers* the age that people first have sex, and increases the likelihood of unplanned pregnancies that will end in abortion. American teens have sex younger and use less protection, and have staggeringly high rates of unwanted pregnancies, compared to teens in other countries with BC and sex ed, where they wait longer, have fewer partners, use more protection, and have almost not unplanned/unwanted pregnancies.

4190,"May I give you some advice, as a secularist?

There is at least one really decent bit of relationship advice in the Good Book, and that is not to allow yourself to be ""unequally yoked."" The verse is advice to Christians to marry other Christians, but I think it applies to all beliefs or doubts, and all kinds of romantic relationships. 

It is my advice to you and to your girlfriend to seriously consider how much this matters to you (and her) and decide if this is something you can both live with, unchanged, for the duration of your relationship. If she harbours hope of converting you, and she is in the middle of doubling down on her beliefs, then you need to quash that unequivocally. You are not interested in conversion. You will not change your mind. Can she live with that? If not, then maybe its ok to let this relationship go. It seems like a silly thing to break up over, but to her, it might be a pretty good reason, and honestly, in the long run, I think it's better to be with someone who shares your core beliefs. If you can't agree on something as basic as the nature of the universe and the reasons that things happen, then I don't see how you can be together through injury, sickness, poverty, joy, happiness, loss, etc. 

This is just my advice. You don't need to heed it. This may not be a very serious relationship to you all, in which case, maybe its ok to ride it out until you inevitably part ways.

But don't commit to something thinking its going to change. It might! But there is no way to be sure. And indeed, it could get worse. Many religious believers because quite dogmatic when it's time to think about marriage. And if you have children, thats a whole different can of worms. You may feel that this conflict is innocuous because there is nothing at stake for you right now. But there may be in the future. 

On a brighter note - sometimes people double down on religion right before they break away entirely.

4196,"This is referred to as ""sexual anorexia"" by some people, and is a common response to sexual trauma. I would say, don't rush it.

First of all, your sexuality is something your experience in your own body, and needn't involve anyone else ever again if you don't want it to. So rather than thinking too far ahead to what sexual intimacy with a partner might be like, maybe you can't focus on your own private sexual life.

My recommendation is erotic fiction, especially if its primarily romantic. That's what got me back into the world after a 2 year abusive marriage and then a 2 year miserable divorce process. I was essentially celibate for 3 years, but in that last year, I started reading Harry Potter fan fic (yes, I know how dorky that sounds). I'm a woman, but everything I read was Harry/Draco or Snape/Lupin stuff, and that allowed it to be far enough away from me to feel safe, and also allowed me to enjoy male sexuality without it feeling threatening to me (because they were directed at eachother). Anyway my particular stuff may not appeal. There is some lovely female autoerotica out in the world of porn generally. My point is, adding a little bit of this to your life might awaken something for you, that you could then explore on your own. Having a healthy masturbatory life is pretty essential to well-being.

Then, maybe, you could consider meeting someone and dating. But what's the rush? A vibrator and a good book are all you need for now. ",2015-09-17 18:59:15+00:00,cv4zqid,1.0,t3_3lbo7m,6459.0,ptsd
4197,"Since you probably don't know, let me share some information with you. Did you know that 60% of women who have abortions are actually mothers? That's right. Over 60% of women who need an abortion actually have one or more children at home already, and they  are choosing an abortion because they cannot afford to have more kids at that time, there is something wrong with the pregnancy, or they are over 40 and their kids are grown and they are done with the baby part of their lives.

Meanwhile 1/2 pregnancies in the US are unplanned. That's 50%. Half of all women who find out they are pregnant had no idea, were not planning on getting pregnant, and were not planning on having a baby. That's a huge problem. We can mitigate that with better access to long term birth control and with comprehensive sex ed. In places with comprehensive sex ed, children wait longer to have sex, and use more protection, and have fewer STIs and unplanned pregnancies. In places with no sex-ed or abstinence only sex ed, children choose to have sex earlier, and end up with more STIs and more unplanned pregnancies. However, even when used correctly, ALL BIRTH CONTROL CAN FAIL.

There will always be a need for abortion. Whether it's to save a mother's life, or because she is not a fit parent, or because she is simply not ready. Pregnancy is not a benign process. Even when everything goes perfectly, your body is destroyed and you suffer permanent changes and permanent damage. It's not a ""huge inconveneince."" Having your car break down on the first day of a new job is a huge inconvenience. Having a child is a life-altering, irreversible, dangerous, permanent change to your entire life, forever. Financially, bodily, mentally, emotionally, logistically, in every way imaginable, your life is forever changed. 95-99% of women who abort do not regret it. MANY MORE women who have children (whether they keep them or give them up for adoption) regret that choice bitterly and can do nothing about it.

Also - making abortion illegal does not eliminate abortion. Abortions continue to occur at roughly the same rates, they are just less safe and women are more likely to die as a result. This was a big reason for why it was decriminalised in the first place. Prior to criminalization, for thousands of years of human history, this was a routine part of women's self-care.

Most abortions (about 80%) are performed in the first 12-14 weeks, by taking a pill which induces a simple miscarriage. It's basically just a heavy period. Its the same as the miscarriages that most women have at least once or twice in their lives anyway. Only 2% are performed late-term, and those fall into two categories: 1) fetal abnormality, where it will suffer and die anyway, most likely, and 2) teenagers who didn't realize they were pregnant, then lied about it and hid it, until it threatened their lives or they finally told someone and got help terminating this horrible thing that's happening to them. 

Yes - personal responsibility matters. THAT'S WHY we should be encouraging women of all ages who are not ready and do not want to have a baby that they cannot afford with some person they do not want to be legally tied to for the rest of their lives, to be RESPONSIBLE and terminate that unplanned, unwanted pregnancy. THAT is the responsible, adult decision.

I posted this elsewhere recently so I'm just going to re-state: 

&gt; I don't wade into the personhood argument anymore, as I have found this to be pointless.
&gt; So for the sake of argument - lets call the fertilized egg a person. That person still does not have the right to enslave another person, even if their life depends on it. If we give the someone the right to restrict and control the actions of another person, draw from their bodily resources, and endanger or inflict violence upon them, then that is a slavery relationship. The latter person is enslaved. And when the state enforces that relationship (by criminalizing abortion and thereby also miscarriage, and drug use during pregnancy, and any number of other choices a woman might make with her own body), the state is complicit in supporting a slave state in which women are property without the freedom of bodily self-determination. And that's wrong.
&gt; A woman has a right to due process - she has a right to her body and her bodily resources, and to opt out of being physically harmed or having her life put in danger, even if severing that slave relationship means that the embryo ceases to be alive. It's right to life does not supersede her rights. In the same way that you cannot be forced to donate blood or organs to others even if it would save their life. Even if the reason they need those things is because you hit them with your own car, you still can't be forced to preserve their life at the cost of your own bodily autonomy and integrity.
&gt; Either women are fully human people with the same rights as everyone else, or they are second class citizens, treated like animals used for breeding, and enslaved for the preservation of the rights of another person.

4202,"I think people used to and still do do this all this time. It's dangerous, but a kid who is used to it or expects it will just go back to bed, even if she's 3 or 4. I bet she thought he'd sleep through it, or if he woke up he'd go back to bed, and that it was highly unlikely that anything would catch fire, and that it was a reasonable gamble. This is fairly common in other places, particularly in situations of considerable poverty and limited resources. People lock their kids in and leave on urgent errands or work a late shift for a few hours. Or yes, make a drug run. It's not uncommon in Europe to leave young children locked in the house to go to the pub down the street for a drink. 
 

Now, that said - yes, this is not a safe practice, and it's especially problematic because a) the children didn't know she might be gone and b) you did not give the ok. Basically, this is a calculated risk some parents choose to take, sometimes out of necessity, sometimes not, BUT it's a decision only the primary caregiver can make. It's like having a couple of nights of drinking during your pregnancy - no, statistically it probably won't result in adverse consequences but it absolutely could, and yeah, it's stupid, but you can still choose to do it. No one can make that choice for you by drugging you, though.

Again, I'm not advocating leaving kids alone, as I am generally a risk-averse person and worry about and go to great lengths to avoid even exceptionally unlikely bad outcomes, like West Nile. I'm just pointing out that it's not that abnormal to take greater risks. There is no question that this judgement call on her part falls onto the ""quite irresponsible"" side of the judgement scale, and, because these are not her own children, this was an incredible violation of your trust.

If this is truly out of her character and she hasn't explained what she was doing, maybe she's unwell, or in with loan sharks, or who knows what.

4224,"Honestly, what you describe sounds less like full-blown exclusive pedophilia, and more like a brain struggling to cope with trauma, a minor sexual fixation on a specific subject, and a generally unexplored and repressed sexuality that has had little opportunity to flourish in the company of other partners.

It is possible to heal from this fixation, if it's primarily a way your brain is coping with the trauma of your own abuse. But every time you get off to those images or fantasies, you are reinforcing the neural pathways and making it harder for yourself. In some therapy circles, you would be told that doing so is an act of re-traumatizing yourself - this is what I have personally been told, and that rather altered how I felt about it, though not necessarily in a way that changed the way I experienced it erotically. My PTSD is also the result of what many people might consider a relatively minor incident, but it had a drastic impact on me, and after years of repression, sexual acting out, and self-medication, I ended up in residential treatment for it. I recommend professional help for you, too, or it will only continue to get worse, and you will damage yourself and your hope for a healthy recovery if you wait too long.  

Relatedly, your ""fondness"" for young people may well be rooted in a desire to reach out to your inner child - yourself as a young person, and provide the support and love you feel you needed at that time. It's just that that affection has been transmuted into something sexual, which is actually pretty common (consider, for example, how often people experience grief and then express it through sexual acting out - it's so commonplace that it's a humourous fixture of funeral movies.) That's not something to feel horrible about, it's something to work through during therapy with a professional, and may indeed be something you can heal.

You may also find that with increased sexual interaction with others your own age, that you are able to find other things and people who are also arousing. That might not remove your attraction to people who are out of reach, but if that attraction isn't exclusive, you will have a better chance at a more fulfilling sexual and emotional life. 

Many, many, many people struggle with sexual attraction to persons who are not sexually available to them, whether because of age, biological relation, being the wrong species, etc, or who struggle with sexual fetishes that they do not want to act on but upon which they are dependent in order to achieve orgasm, even if its only a matter of imagination. These people are still able to get on with their lives if they can let go of the guilt and shame associated with a neurologic condition they did not choose or cause and cannot control, and if they can find either healthy outlets for it or other more diverse interests that also work for them.

Don't give up hope at a productive, fulfilling, joyful life because you have a sexual fixation on something problematic. You are not alone. You just need to take positive steps toward finding true emotional and sexual intimacy with others, and hopefully you will find that while you may always struggle with attraction to underage people, that this attraction is not exclusive. 


Edit: Also, just for the record, there is a reason why incest, mixed-age, and adolescent porn is so very, very popular. The number one search term is consistently ""teen."" Early pubescent and adolescent people are beginning to show secondary sex characteristics and that is actually supposed to be sexually attractive, evolutionarily speaking. It's just that those people are not yet ready or able to consent to sexual activity with people outside of their immediate age group, if any at all beyond masturbation. An attraction to early adolescence is actually no where near as problematic as sexual attraction to, say, a toddler. Part of the ease with which you've acquired this fixation is simply biology. Lots of people feel this way. It doesn't need to colour your entire identity - so you find the occasional 7th grader attractive. Ok fine. As long as you don't act on that, and as long as you are able to focus on trying to find more appropriate outlets and more appropriate objects for your desire, you can move forward like all of the rest of us, and live a perfectly healthy life. But to do so will take some concerted effort now to break the mental fixation, address the trauma in your childhood, and explore the rest of your sexuality.",2015-09-16 15:38:00+00:00,cv3kmn3,1.0,t3_3l4wqf,36987.0,depression

I sincerely hope that doesn't happen, for your sake, but if you need support with an abortion decision, there are lots of resources here, and on r/prochoice and r/childfree.

4295,"Oh I'm not suggesting tricking her. You can't trick my 8 yo either. She knows that it's school work. She simply wants the rewards.  

Khan academy and apps like that are designed to reward you in the short-term with stats - lots and lots of stats: you get stats in all of the skills at every level and it starts with pre-k and goes up through MCAT prep, so the sky is the limit - but it's constructed in small pieces of related skills that are level appropriate, and you earn badges and trophies, and there is a way to track your improvement and earn points for skill practicing and skills mastery - its just an elaborate scoring system that is very effective for someone who likes gaming OR particularly for someone who, like your sister, needs more than a far-off reward to make the daily grind of effort worth it. This way, she gets immediate feedback and reinforcement. That's effective whether you are 3, 13, or 103! 

She hasn't developed the skills she needs to set long-term goals for herself because she's never set any - apps like this will help her build those skills as well. AND there is a built in accountability component - you would set up the free account as the supervising adult, and add her as the child/student (that's how its designed) so you can see everything she's done and where she's doing well or poorly, etc. You can even tick off the skills you want her to practice next, and the system will start adding them in to her upcoming practice sets. It's really great. It's also something that you can spend a short amount of time on. She could do 10 minutes of Khan academy, take a 50 min break for minecraft, and then do another 10 mins, take another break, and after a 6 hour day from 11-5 pm she will have spent a whole hour working on math skills, which is more than she's ever done in a day, I would bet. By the end of the week, she'll have done 5 hours of math work.

There are apps like this for reading too - I wish I could point you to some off the top of my head. What you need are reading lists by Guided Reading Level or Lexile Score, that come with really short quizzes that just prove she read it (whether it's a little reader or just a chapter of a longer book). She should be able to take the quiz to get ""credit"" for the reading. You should be able to log in and see what she's read, what's in her queue, and be able to add books to her queue as she goes. She's not going to start reading for pleasure or even for a long term goal without an immediate reward yet - so she should be earning points for everything, and those points should accumulate. But you need the accountability of quizzes, or in-app reading exercises because she's going to be prone to cheating and cutting corners (as we all are, but particularly because she is a 13 year old with almost no boundaries or responsibilities). You and your other sister can each take one of these subjects and be the supervising adult. That way she's accountable to both of you, and she's knows you're invested, and she also can't manipulate (saying one was too hard, so she wants to skip the other that week) you because you are a team but you have separate goals for her.

A points system is not a trick, it's a structured way to record incremental progress toward a long-term goal - otherwise that long-term goal (a short visit to a sister, for example) seems way too far off to warrant the daily effort. If you needed 1200 points to get something, earning 1 at a time will not feel worth the effort because it's just so little of the total needed. Especially if you have never worked for or saved for anything before. So you need immediate feedback, and lots of short-term goals to motivate her to keep going. Do your parents have money? Would they incentivise with cash for short-term goals (per book, then per 10 books / per hour and then per week of math work), while allowing her accumulate over-all points for bigger goals like reading 100 short books up to 3rd grade reading level and getting through grade 3 maths by Christmas? 

Having a few specific skills to work on, with immediate feedback from an app, short-term goals rewarded at regular progress intervals, and a big long-term goal to work for, and someone checking-in on her progress daily to hold her accountable, and being obliged to fit it into her daily schedule around her other activities by actually minding the time and doing things on a schedule, would go a really long way to equipping her with the organization, time management, motivation, and delayed reward skills she is so sorely lacking. Without those, she not only won't ever acquire the reading and math skills (much less science, history, other things she needs to be learning) but they won't do her any good if she can't manage her time or motivate herself to work toward a goal.

If you can work towards getting her to mid-3rd-grade competency by Christmas (which may not be too much of a stretch for her, who knows) that would be a good benchmark. At that pace, she could be on 5th grade math and reading by summer 2016, and on 6th/7th grade by summer 2017, and could be caught up to her own grade level by the start of 2018. That should be your over-arching goal - what is it going to take to get this girl caught up to the base level for her age? If you start now, you could maybe do it in as little as 2.5 years. Maybe way faster if she gets super motivated.

Other people will continue to recommend CPS and I don't disagree with that. I'm just trying to provide some concrete steps you can take to intervene in addition to that approach.

4307,"&gt; Everyone, says the doctor who disagrees with 12-step programs. There's a set of vocal people who are always touting the abysmal 5% success rate, so I certainly wouldn't say everyone. AA is a controversial topic among recovering addicts.

Clearly he doesn't mean *literally* everyone, he means there is a majority consensus. If courts across the country, rehabs, and hospitals everywhere, almost all refer to or require participation in 12-step programs, either as part of medical care or as a legal consequence, that's still *effectively* everyone. A consensus among legal authorities and medical providers is enough to make a general statement that most people still think it's effective.

&gt; OK, so maybe he should provide some source for this.

That's actually not hard to do. The basic tenet of AA is that if you relapse, that's on you alone, but if you succeed, that's due to AA/Higher Power. You can't actually succeed yourself, *and* you alone are responsible for your failure. It's true, AA will say that its not for everyone, but it is for every alcoholic. So either you don't need it because you aren't really an alcoholic, or you are and you aren't working it right, because if you do work it right, it works. That's literally the promise at the end of every meeting: ""Keep coming back; it works if you work it."" 

&gt; Finally, it's fine to attack AA, but I'd like to see him offer a scientific alternative, specifically one that's free.

It would be easier to try to come up with one if people didn't treat this one as infallible and unimpeachable. But sure - I absolutely agree that a free programme like this is amazingly helpful for many people, especially when they are first getting sober. As I've said, it saved my life. But within AA, I could only ever have been either attending and 100% abstinent, or a relapsing failure. There is no narrative for dealing with issues, developing better behaviours, and eventually not drinking like a fish anymore. If its possible for you to get to a point where you actually can drink normally, then either you were ever truly addicted (which is self-evidently untrue for most people who eventually get past AA and move on with their lives) or you are one day going to end up back there.

I don't want AA to go away, I'm glad it's there. I'll go back if I ever need to. But I'm also interested in other approaches, and there is no room or funding for those as long as everyone still accepts that this is the only way.

This is a great way to think about it but it's definitely not how the Big Book talks about it. The Big Book talks about ""defects of character,"" not maladaptive behaviours.

That's true. But even if the Big Book doesn't make that claim, AA does effectively have a monopoly in that there are almost zero other programmes available, and 12-step programmes are so codified in our legal and medical system that they are prescribed by doctors and mandated by courts. That's a level of government and institutional legitimization that makes competition virtually impossible. The founders could never had envisioned that, but that's the state of it.

The constitution should be rewritten, as it has been in every modern democracy but ours.

The actual longest-lived western democracy, Iceland (a democracy since the 900s), has managed to get their act together and write laws their citizens need and want. Same with France, Germany, Finland, even India. We (the global community) have tried many different types now around the world, we know what works and what doesn't. 

The reason there is NO common core and teachers are paid almost nothing is States Rights (another constitutional issue). We have people living in third-world conditions, 50% of pregnancies are unplanned because of limited access to sex-ed and contraception, we still have the freaking death penalty, and we are the only nation other than Papua New Guinea that doesnt guarantee family medical leave. We torture people and hold them illegally without charges or trial. We have spent every ounce of moral authority we once had.

You said you have a high sex drive and you think vanilla sex is the problem. That may be. It's absolutely possible that adding more toys, roleplaying, etc might work for you.

However, if that does not work, I hope you will consider some rather radical advice, which is to seek a partner whom you love and want to be vulnerable with. Doing so may be required anyway, to find someone who wants to try whatever kinky stuff you're into, since obviously that will entail sharing those things, and asking for what you need, which can be quite vulnerable.

But you don't sound like you have trouble talking about what you like.

So I'm going to suggest that you might, possibly, find sex is more rewarding with someone that you are deeply *emotionally* intimate with. I'm suggesting this because it's what made the difference for me. I was always eager to have sex, but never really enjoyed it that much, and never got off. I fantasized elaborately and eventually sought out people who like what I like, but I didn't feel fulfilled. I mean maybe the first time it was validating. But after that, the novelty wore off, I didn't feel like I'd kicked my fetish, but I didn't really want to share it like that anymore. So I went back to vanilla sex with my partner who didn't care if I got off, and I stopped caring, and I just went on that way.

Until I met my current partner. It's completely different. It's intense and intimate and beautiful (and occasionally kinky) but it's honest, and pleasurable, because I stopped rushing myself, and letting my mental hormones get ahead of my biological readiness. And because sex with him is a ge uine expression of love and companionship. Its great. And I learned to be mindful, and balance the fantasies I need to get off with the focus I want to give my partner.

Don't sell you self short or settle for sex that's meaningless and unsatisfying. If that's not working for you, maybe try something new?",2015-09-10 01:44:32+00:00,cuwb0ld,3.0,t1_cuw94cp,3362.0,TwoXSex

People behave like addicts: they take risks they wouldnt normally take, make choices they regret, yet do it over and over again, to the detriment of their finances, their marriages, their jobs - they ruin their lives, and cannot stop despite concerted efforts. That's addictive behavior. It doesn't need to be diagnosable yet to be real in the lived experiences of people who suffer with it. Tell someone who cannot stop that they just need to stop and see how well that goes. Orgasm travels along the same neural pathways as cocaine. Cocaine addiction isn't an addiction to the drug, it's an addiction to the neurologic stimulation and resultant flood of chemicals in the brain. Orgasm results in the same dopamine response. If someone risks their career, family, and life in pursuit of that feeling, and yet cannot stop despite their best efforts and the efforts of others, they are experiencing an addiction. And if intervention helps them, which it does, then that's good enough for me. And for everyone suffering from or treating it.

TDLR just because a condition or syndrome hasn't yet been defined or codified, does not mean it's not real. Identifying and classifying diseases and syndromes, especially ones with causes as nebulous and symptoms as wide-ranging as addictions or psychiatric conditions, for which there are myriad subtypes, and more case studies than clinical trials, is an interpretive process.

But I'm not of the belief that its impossible to eventually have a healthy relationship with food, sex, money, all of those things that are essential to our lives. That said, I do try to avoid the kinds of porn that are a problem for me, and redirect as much as I can into intimacy with others.

Yeah I posted this partly because I really *do* believe that it can be a serious problem, but it's like everyone has lost any sense of perspective here. There is probably even a lower level of casual porn use, which is not daily just-to-get-off use, but like once-a-week/month-when-the-house-is-empty-as-a-treat use. Also, emphatically NOT an addiction, just an indulgence.

It clouds the issue to lump those all together and it prevents people who actually need help, from getting help, while criminalising (metaphorically) and medicalising normal varieties of sexual behavior. 

Again, no one is suggesting that is really great to always use PMO to cope with stress or loneliness - it's just that the *reason* they are using isn't because the person is addicted. The *reason* they are using it is because they lack other outlets and tools to sustain distress without needing to turn to booze, pot, porn, etc, so that those things are just used for fun and pleasure and not something you *need* to make it through the week.

I, for one, would be utterly unable to know if I wanted to marry someone without an extended courtship involving the three things that matter the most to me: intellectual, familial, and sexual compatibility. Consequently, my bf and I spend A LOT of time with each other's families, together (regular family dinners, cook outs, visits, and outings; he also stays over at my house with my parents and brothers there and helps out with cooking and cleaning) and separately. We also talk A LOT. Like, all the time. All day long through gchat. And we partially cohabit - we live together on the weekends and holidays and practice being a family, which means laundry, cooking, sharing tasks and finances, decision making, dealing with stress and privacy, parenting and pethood. It also means sex. Quite a lot of sex. We choose to make a point of prioritizing it as part of our night together, or it won't happen, and we consider it a shared responsibility to be intimate.

BUT this is because we are both divorced. We have both left unhappy young marriages (and his was a conservative christian wait-until-marriage marriage) and both of them went up in flames within 2 years. So.... we are making decisions now based on what makes rational sense and what works for us, and trusting that our judgement, together, will lead us to happiness.

I sincerely hope that your choices lead you to happiness too. ",2015-09-09 19:18:22+00:00,cuvwyoj,7.0,t1_cuvw2i6,1372.0,Christianity

4362,"Yeah, if he feels he's addicted, there is no reason to undermine his language, i posted this partly because people in here often diagnose ""addiction"" where there is just persistent use or abuse. I think, for my part, that he sounds like he's prone to abuse in the same way that my good friend is prone to alcohol abuse. He drinks socially (normal use) but he also routinely drinks specifically because he's had a bad day and wants to alter his mood (abuse / self-medication). But if he wakes up with a hangover the next (ie - feels remorse) he won't then start drinking again until the next controlled, social drinking occasion, and it may be a while before drinks heavily again (though he probably eventually will have another terrible day and end up using it to self-medicate). Its not the healthiest pattern in the world, BUT instead on focusing on eliminating the temptation and talking about alcohol and making him feel bad about it, we're working on distress tolerance and alternate ways of medicating, some of which are healthier (excercise, meditation, regular therapy) and some are probably also not great, but not that bad either (sex with his gf, pot, video games). With enough stratified coping mechanism, none of them gets too out of hand, and in the long run, the goal is to find more positive outlets and greater tolerance for stress, so that he has fewer days that feel terrible, even if, by earlier standards, they would have. 

I'm just trying to reframe this so that it's not just this goal held aloft and then a series of constant failures - thats a terrible narrative for his journey. He's not constantly failing. He's doing the best he can, and the broader the range of alternatives for stress management and sexual outlets (and seriously, he's going to need some options or it's bad for his prostate) then it's more about a journey toward better options. Don't focus on transgressions and confessions and shame and guilt and disappointment. Focus on strategies for next time. And be ok with the fact that he might just revert from being someone who abuses porn, to someone who uses it sometimes. That's still an improvement!

He rests on my shoulder sleepily kissing me while I masturbate right before sleep every night - otherwise I won't get off. And when we live apart, I certainly am not going to not sleep because he's not there to masturbate with me. 

But I digress - there are certainly things about my sex life that I would like to simplify, and I'm really, really happy for you if your choices are working for you.

------
There is a difference between porn use, porn abuse, and porn dependence/addiction. 
-------

* If he uses it now and then to get off, regardless of how he feels about it, that's porn use. It's something he does sometimes and while it might not be the most healthy strategy for getting off, its an easy short-cut to feeling good and relieving an urge, but just like an occasional drink at the end of the day, or eating that extra bowl of ice-cream because he had a bad day -  its something he does that might not be great but is a calculated risk he is choosing to take because he's an adult and its his life. It's a temptation he gives into - maybe even daily, for the purpose of getting aroused and getting off, which many people need to do to get to bed at night or to relax after work, and he may feel bad about it sometimes, but overall it's not destroying his life or really taking up much time or energy either way and he helps blow off steam and reduce stress, so on balance its at worst having a neutral effect on his health and happiness. If he really, truly needed to go without (ie - if his smart phone fell into the pool and he was at his parents house with no internet), he could manage.

* If he is consistently using porn for a lot more than just getting off - like, browsing when he's bored or lonely, browsing at work during lunch, spending more money than he has to spare on it, and using it as a form of escape from reality when he's emotionally upset or distressed, and while he can still get off without it and seems to still want to have sex with you when things are fine, he uses it avoid having to be intimate with you when you are fighting, and its mostly just episodes of binging, or a perpetual undercurrent of usage throughout the day whenever he has down time, with spikes when he's truly stressed, depressed, hurt, etc, then he's abusing it - he's using it beyond it's intended use, to self-medicate other issues, and probably not helping to relieve those issues.

* If he's using pornography all the time - all day, basically: at home, at work, driving in the car, all the time, even if he only masturbates like once or twice the whole day - and it's now impossible for him to achieve an orgasm with a partner without porn in the back ground, and he has escalated to much more hard-core forms of porn, including ones he does not want to be using, and if his usage is causing him considerable, clinical distress, and is putting his job in jeopardy (using a work computer, for example) or his legal status in jeopardy (using illegal pornography, for example) or jeopardizing his marriage and custody of his children, and his masturbation is causing him physical injury through over use, and despite many ongoing desperate attempts to quit, using every means at his disposal, from blocking software to accountability partners to destroying his smart phone and he knows any day now everything will crash down around him, or has already begun to and he *still cannot stop,* then he's an addict, and he needs professional help.

4371,"I met my ex and my current bf on OkC, both pretty much immediately became relationships. 

With my current bf, we met for a free informal chill session at a bookstore on a friday which eventually devolved into making out in the back of his car like teenagers. Then we hung out again the next night (and had sex the first time, which was excellent for everyone involved - right from the beginning it was evident that we clicked). And then on Sunday he insisted in taking me out to an actual dinner and a show (live theatre). It's not often someone not only wants to talk all the next day, but begs to take me on a (fairly pricey for our budgets) dinner date the night *after* we hook up. Especially since we both went in not wanting anything strictly exclusive. But I think he really liked me, and I know I really liked him. He also came out as bisexual that third night (well, heteroflexible, though he now identifies as bisexual). 

Those three dates that one weekend last August ended up being pretty foundational. We discussed our divorces (we each have one in our past), our plans for the future, all kinds of things they tell you not to talk about, like: remarriage, future children (i already have one, he wants some of his own), religious and sexual compatibility, family histories, pets (dogs are a hard no for me), mental health and drug use, sexual histories. We covered our respective salaries and minimum expenses within a week of that conversation, too (we make about the same, give or take 1-2k). It's not so much that all of our expectations or plans matched or anything - indeed, we identified some conflicts - but what we learned is that we both like to be honest, open, and fully-informed when preparing for decision-making. 

Anyway about 2 weeks in we said the L word, and he met my family pretty fast (they are heavily enmeshed in my life)  and yeah - here we are over a year later and still going strong. 

----------------------------------
Edit: side note for anyone out there who could use a happy story, here is how we first said ""I love you"":

We're sitting at an old BBQ place in a part of town he doesn't necessarily love (too ""parky,"" we would say here in Dallas), but this place is old-timey and quaint. We're sitting across from each other in a booth and the waitress just took our order. I'm paying because I know he's broke that day, so this is my treat. Apparently he's never dated anyone who occasionally picked up the tab. Its been about 2 weeks now and we've seen each other at least every other day and all weekend.

We're both kind of exhausted - we were up late the night before and we had an early morning, so we aren't talking much. We're just contentedly gazing at each other. And this feeling between us, it's been hovering there for a while now. Every time we've had sex the previous week or so I was feeling it, and I thought he might be too. Sometimes he would meet my eyes as we were kissing and it looked like he was pained by holding something in. I found myself biting my lip, often. 

So there we are sitting across from each other in a kitchy old-timey BBQ joint with steer horns and old rodeo posters hanging on walls covered with yellowing, patterned wall paper, and moth-eaten window treatments. And he's gazing at me, and I'm gazing at him. And he's smiling. And I'm smiling too. And we sort of sit up a little, so we are incrementally closer to the table that separate us, and he inhales like he might say something, but then demurs, and turns away, so I smile and catch his eye and say, nodding, ""I want to say it, too."" Immediately, without hesitation, he declares ""I love you, dallasdarling."" And I say ""I love you too, aberdeenphoenix."" And we jumped up and kissed over the table, and then held hands in pleasantly giggly silence until our food came.

4374,"Went with family, kids aged 4 to 14. Mine was 4, and still in floaties at the time. Everything I'm going to say is relevant to preschool-kindergarten aged kids specifically.

* Pools are great but don't over - estimate how much swimming anyone that age is actually up for. They will get worn out after an hour or two, maybe three. You'll need to take breaks before they are ready for more.

* Don't be afraid to follow nap schedules or require a siesta after lunch and lots of water. It might feel like you are wasting precious holiday time but trust me, you will get more out of it if you pace yourself and still keep things are routine as possible for them. 

* Bring snacks and late night microwaveable meals - you get a fridge in your room and everything is overpriced

* Make sure everyone is drinking water, because being submersed actually leaches fluids from you, that's why your fingers and toes turn pruny. 

* Bring warm clothes - I know, I sound crazy, but trust me. It's super air conditioned, everyone will have wet hair, and you'll all be running on adrenaline, don't add to that by being cold, make sure all the little people have layers and babies have hats and everyone has socks on. It's like 60 degrees in the lobby alone. 

* The indoor treasure hunt sort of thing requires an adult until about age 7 or 8 depending on the kid or if they are in a group, so with little ones, you need to help. It's not going to be too much fun for anyone who doesn't walk well, but with a little folding stroller you could easily bring a baby along to follow after an eager 5 year old. It's all in doors. 

* The bed time story told by a wolf character in costume is super fun, don't miss it. Kids come in pajamas and the scenery talks, it's great.

* The gift shop is very alluring and hard to avoid, so plan to
 set expectations early. However, I will note that among their offerings are these cute little wolf ears. We got my daughter a pair and she wore them to preschool for months thereafter. Thus began a love and affinity for wolves that has lasted undiminished several years (she's 8 now).

Aversion and revulsion is often exaggerated in younger men who are very concerned with projecting their heteronormativity in order to secure the privilege that comes with being a straight male. People who really feel deep aversion like homophobia are statistically more likely to actually be attracted to other men and repressing it.

So.... if you feel like it's not something you'd be into but it wouldn't be terrible, then you're probably just a plain, run of the mill, straight or slightly hetero flexible guy. And whoever in your life is so aggressively homophobic is probably either trying too hard or lying to himself. ",2015-09-06 22:34:14+00:00,cusvvod,1.0,t3_3jiyxf,269703.0,bisexual

But for this, IME, less is more. Use lots of spit and very light pressure, and try to go slowly and rhythmically, licking down either side of her clitoral hood, but don't go anywhere near the inside of her inner labia. Just stay up above and to the sides of her clitoris. Gently, softly, wetly. Less is more. The more you pull back, the better.

Here's my advice, which I've posted in there and which was relatively well-received: 

&gt; I think talking isn't really much help if you don't follow it up with actions.
&gt; Context: My partner and I are both young and divorced out of deadbedroom relationships and we work really hard to keep ours alive.
&gt; One thing that works for us is that at the beginning of every evening (after dinner and after the kid is in bed) we sit down and make a plan for the evening, including what we want/need to get done (housework, school work, an episode of a show we like) but first and foremost, when and how are we going to make time for physical intimacy. For us, the best policy is to start there - give it at least 45 minutes of just being in bed naked together cuddling and talking. Sometimes we go in explicitly planning to have sex, other times we just plan to cuddle and see where it leads. Sometimes we browse a little porn on the phone (but that kind of depends on how I'm feeling, I have a weird relationship to porn use). No work talk, to kid talk - we talk about the future, we talk about our relationship, we avoid arguments in favour of talking about things that make us happy, and things we appreciate about each other, and make a point of saying how nice it is to just be alone together snuggling. If we get off topic we try to be mindful and table that conversation for later so we can stay focused on being together. Sometimes we just lie there quietly and read, with my head on his shoulder, or spooning him. There is usually a fair bit of kissing. Often this leads to sex, but not always, and that's ok too, because cuddling is also awesome. Sometimes it will lead to one or the other of us simply masturbating while the other one watches/helps, or reads, or rests beside him/her.
After about 45-90 mins, we are usually feeling much better about life, and flooded with Oxycontin, and can decide where to go from there. Smoke a bowl, have a drink, watch a show, work on a game, read for school, etc.
You can talk all you want about how you want to have more sex. But unless you actually schedule the opportunity into your life every day, without fail, because it's a priority for you, it won't happen. That's my advice to you. Carve out time to commit to being intimate with each other every day.",2015-09-02 20:26:36+00:00,cuoj5pk,1.0,t3_3jd63a,19289.0,sex

4458,"I think I can alleviate your hell-phobia.

Consider this: the current medical and legal definition of death is brain death, which is a logically defensible position. Why is this? Because once your brain ceases to function, everything that makes you who you are has ceased to exist. All of your thoughts, memories, habits, mannerisms, preferences, desires, dreams, secrets, all of it is just data whirring around between the synapses in your brain, and as soon as the electricity stops whizzing around in your brain, all of that data is lost forever. 

Just think about what that means for a second.

That means that everything about who you are - your entire consciousness (the ability to be aware of reality), and all of your sentience (the ability to perceive stimuli like pleasure and pain), and all of your self-awareness (the ability to know that you are aware and feeling) is an organic function of the brain.

That means that nothing, not one thing, about your ability to feel pain, your awareness of yourself, or anything about you, can possibly survive after your brain dies. 

That means that you, and I, and every single person who has ever lived or will ever live, is utterly and irrevocably mortal.

Ergo - Death is final. 

So who cares if there is a hell? We won't be going there because once we are dead, there won't be an ""us"" to go anywhere.

------------------

Edit: this was the first part of my shelf to break. I was 12 years old, and I came to this conclusion researching the legal definition of death in preparation to defend Jack Kevorkian in a Mock Trials class. And that was it for me. Regardless of any other beliefs I might have clung to later until adulthood, this part was clear to me from that moment on. Death is final, there can be no afterlife.

Christians like to lump all sexual sins in together, throwing masturbation and pornography (private sexual behaviours) in with adultery (a violation of your partners trust and safety) and rape (an act of violence). 

I do actually have a big problem with adultery, but not because it's going against monogamy. I'm poly - I'm fine with consensual non-monogamy. What I'm not ok with is lying, betraying, and exposing your partner to risks they didn't agree to. That is inexcusable. But it's not a sexual sin, it's a betrayal of trust and it's a violation of boundaries - boundaries around the health risks your partner has consented to take. 

Lumping all of these issues together makes no sense, and does no one any good, and only serves to shame and degrade perfectly healthy sexual inpulses, and minimize and excuse acts of violence and abuse, and redirect the true nature of betrayal in favour of just addressing the erotic components and avoiding the deep emotional components of adultery.

4493,"Story time!!

My bf Paul (not his real name) came out as heteroflexible and ultimately as bisexual this year. He came out to me last summer when we met, pretty much within 3 days of meeting (so basically the day after we sleep together for the first time). I just point blank asked him if he was fully straight, and he said no, he was heteroflexible and had a major crush on both NPH and Nathan Fillion. I didn't realize it at the time but I'm apparently the first person he came out to point blank like that. I was excited to hear it, because I'm bisexual and I pretty much only date other non-straight people because I prefer to be in same-orientation relationships. We're also poly, which will become relevant.

Anyway...... so at the time last summer, Paul told me about this friend he had, Ted (also not his real name), who had just broken up with his boyfriend, and Paul admitted that in the years he'd been friend with Ted, he'd developed a crush and kind of wanted to hook up with him.

About six months later, our relationship is going great, and we throw a party and invite some of his friends over. In the lead up to this, Paul and Ted have been flirting A LOT, and its clear to me that Ted is into it but thinks its just a joke on Paul's part, and is afraid that if he makes a move, Paul will freak out and it will ruin their friendship because he thinks Paul is straight because he performs his gender very heteronormatively. Also he has a girlfriend, moi. Anyway, I encourage Paul to come out at the party, or at least come out to Ted, since Ted has remained single since that summer break-up. Well, Paul gets tipsy and I provide the opportunity and viola! He comes out, Ted is super receptive, and by the time I'm leaving (had to leave early that night, partly to facilitate this hook up, actually) they are making out.

Here we are 9 months later, and Paul and Ted have been dating ever since. They don't see each other as often as they'd like, and my relationship with Paul is still primary and we plan on staying together long-term whereas Ted is likely to start seeing someone who is available to be exclusive. And Ted and I don't love each other but we both love Paul so it works out fine when we are around each other, though that is pretty rare. BUT, they are happy together, and overall it's been a positive thing for both of them. And no matter what I think about Ted, I love and respect that he has been so kind, gentle, patient, and loving to Paul, who is immeasurably precious to me. 

Paul's family does not know about his other relationship and that's ok, they don't need to, he's an adult and is entitled to some privacy. They, too, are conservative Christians. My family doesn't know, not because they have a problem with GSMs, but because they, too, somewhat doubt the legitimacy of bisexuality. And it's true, Ted himself has probed several times to see if Paul isn't truly just gay and in denial, but no, that doesn't seem to be the case. He's just bisexual, like 1/3 or more people everywhere, it's starting to seem (after the UK, US, and Israel studies).

Anyway - it worked out. The people involved are happy. And my bf is happy and feels loved and fulfilled and has fully embraced his bisexuality (and his preference for bottoming! which I think is soooooo sexy) and yet its still exceptionally rare that he finds a guy that he's attracted to, and is not likely to ever hook up with any guy he doesn't know really, really well (whereas he'll sleep with a girl on the first date if he can.)

So in conclusion, I encourage you to go for it. Life is short and you like this guy. Ask him out for a drink, let yourself get a little tipsy, and just come out with it. You never know what might come of it.

Good luck!",2015-09-01 15:37:07+00:00,cun2vwb,1.0,t3_3ixekj,210067.0,bisexual
4494,"It counts if you think it counts.

Look - some people consider ""bi-sexual"" to mean ""male and female,"" but in order for that definition to work, you have to buy the gender binary. I don't. I prefer to say that the ""bi"" in ""bi-sexual"" means my own sex/gender plus one or more other sexes/genders. (Yes, I'm listing sex and gender together, and no, I don't mean that they are synonymous.)

I continue to say bisexual because I'm not actually pan-sexual - I'm not attracted to all sexes and genders, or to all people regardless of sex or gender. I actually do have preferences, they just aren't exclusive preferences. ""Plurisexual"" might work, but how many labels do we really need? Besides, when I came out 15 years ago, I came out as bisexual - it's still a core part of my identity.

4502,"&gt; By disallowing all ""religious"" modes of identity in the neutral ground, it is endorsing only those atheistic modes of communal belonging and identity.

No one is talking about ""disallowing all ""religious"" modes of identity"" - I'm not even sure what that would mean. Children in schools are free to identify with whatever religious persuasion they choose. They can bring bibles to school, hold bible study, pray at lunch, declare their allegiance to a country ""under God,"" pray before football games, proselytize in common areas, etc. It's just that the school cannot give over class-time to such pursuits, or endorse other leadership to disseminate beliefs to students. But the students are free to identify any way they like. Their religious expression isn't being restricted *at all*.

That's particularly ironic when you consider that its against the establishment clause for the US government or any of its entities to endorse any religious opinion. Wouldn't you want to err on the side of caution in the interest of ""living up to our own rules?""

&gt; if you think Christianity, or any other religion, for that matter, has nothing to teach people for the improvement of their lives,

Stop throwing out this straw-man over and over again. I have never said that there is nothing beneficial to be learned from religious study, I have said that that religious education does not belong in schools. It's an after-school, at home, and weekend activity, it does not belong in public schools. 

&gt; why don't you just admit to your atheism? Why maintain even this shallow veneer of Anglicanism?

It is perfectly rational to hold beliefs and to still want religious education to remain out of public schools. That's the second time you've violated Rule 2.3 of this sub, so at this point I'm not going to further engage you after this.

Typical rule of thumb in childhood experimentation is 3 years - if you are 3 years apart or more, its reasonable to expect the younger person to experience that as coercive. Your sister is only 2 years younger, but she seems to have experienced this (or seems to remember it now) as traumatic. There isn't much you can do other than validate it and try to accommodate her.

In her defense, your experimentation did go on well past childhood. You say, ""we were only children"" but by the time you were 13-15, you were certainly only enough to experiment with peers and friends your own age, whereas she, during that period from 11-13, was not. A 15 year old is sexually mature and ready to be dating and experimenting with a boyfriend or girlfriend. Moreover, a 15 year old would have been old enough to set responsible boundaries when her younger sibling tried to engage her sexually.

Besides, so-called ""normal"" experimentation is typically a one-off thing. Maybe it happens twice. Whereas 5 years of incest, however infrequent, is probably not healthy for anyone. It probably wasn't healthy for you, either, though being the old sibling, you probably never felt like you couldn't say no. 

That said, none of us were there. I don't even know how often or how much you engaged in this behaviour. I think her experience is probably valid, not because you were some kind of sexual abuser, but because the two of you were engaged in underage incest, which is just generally not an ideal way to explore your sexuality (though obviously there is nothing *inherently* wrong about consensual incest, but clearly she has strong feelings about it.)

But, are you suggesting that *all women* experience sexual desire as a ""lust for attention?"" What? That would make *all women* only ever the object of desire, and never the subject. Never actively desiring another person, wanting to touch them and feel them and do things to them. Is that what you are saying? Because that's problematic. That's the whole ""male gaze"" thing that constructs women as a sex object to direct desire at, and not as a person who actively desires others.

If that's how you feel, fine, but I don't think you should make any assumptions about how other women feel just because you feel that way. I certainly don't ever feel that way. This isn't a matter of individual difference - I think the majority of people who experience desire experience it actively - as desire for another person, not wanting them to desire you. That's sort of..... reflexive, almost. 

If you've never felt any kind of active desire for another person, maybe you've never actually met anyone you were that attracted to? Or maybe you just prefer the passive object role.

Of course! All the time. Evolution is the process of intelligence emerging from non-intelligence. In fact, it's happened more than once, since cuttle-fish and their relatives, octopodes and squids, have intelligence that evolved completely separately from the rest of the intelligent animal world.

But an even simple example is of course the incredible intelligence and order of bee, ant, and termite colonies, who are able to accomplish amazing and complex things beyond the capacity or even comprehension of any of the individuals in the colony, and emphatically without any central intelligence or plan. This is called the science of Emergence, and it's an exciting field that studies the emergence of order from disorder, which absolutely can be observed in nature in many different contexts.

4594,"Just for the sake of diversity, I wanted to offer my input as an **apatheist**. This view is based on our best understanding of the nature of human consciousness and thought, and the deterministic nature of the universe.

* **Death is Final** - as far as we can tell (even accounting for the anomalous instances where our instruments have been unable to pick up brain waves well enough to conclusively rule out so-called ""miraculous"" coma awakenings), everything about who you are, what you think, what you feel, remember, love, fear, and believe, is the product of electrical signals in the brain, and all of that vanishes when your brain turns off. This means that once your brain is dead, you have ceased to exist. Your body may still be alive, nominally, with the help of machines, but you are dead. This is the current legal definition of death: brain death. I accept this definition because it makes rational sense to me. It also follows rationally that if you have ceased to exist because the machinery which housed you no longer functions, and that machinery cannot be brought back into function again, that death is a permanent condition. There is no other reality, there is no other place where ""you"" could go, because you do not exist outside of the neural networks that house you. Therefore, death is final. I came to this conclusion when I was 12 years old.

* **Reality is Deterministic** - The world in which we live is essentially deterministic (well, ok, it's really more accurate to say probabilistic, but lets not get ourselves into a quantum entanglement over semantics!). This means that when something happens, it happens because of a cause-and-effect relationship somewhere. There is a rational explanation out there to explain all phenomena observed, even if we haven't yet figured it out. We have reason to believe that we can figure it out because we have a tool that works: the scientific method. So.... if material reality is not being acted on by outside, supernatural forces, then God is not, at this time, acting on our reality in any measurable way. If God were acting on reality, it would be measurable, and therefore provable. I came to this conclusion when I surrendered the last vestiges of my superstitions around 20 years old. 

So if God is not affecting anything that happens in this life, *and* there is no other life after this because all lives end in death, then **God's existence is functionally irrelevant.** Therefore, I'm an apatheist. I'm apathetic about the existence or non-existence of a being that does not materially influence the only reality in which I, personally, will ever exist.

There is a difference between asserting that a woman ought to have a basic right to choose to end a pregnancy at any point without restrictions, and the right to terminate the fetus in question at any point without restriction. As you say, women seeking late term abortions are rare, and even more rare are those with viable healthy pregnancies, and in that case, I see no problem with simply permitting her to induce early so that she achieves her goal of no longer being pregnant, and the state achieves its goal of preserving potentially viable fetuses, if possible, through medical intervention. If the tax payer cares about that life, the tax payer can fund its care. The women should be under no obligation to remain pregnant any longer than she chooses to, imo.

You're basically positing that women should be punished for taking the risk by having sex. Our species has evolved to need sex and sexual intimacy as part of a full life from a very early age, and it's primary function is definitely not procreative, but you would restrict it only to circumstances where someone wants to get pregnant?

So we sat down and decided that we needed to continue to make a commitment of time and effort, everyday, to being intimate (whether sexual or not) so that there was a clear and open line of communication and always a safe opportunity for either of us to initiate.

4641,"I think talking isn't really much help if you don't follow it up with actions. 

Context: My partner and I are both young and divorced out of deadbedroom relationships and we work really hard to keep ours alive. 

One thing that works for us is that at the beginning of every evening (after dinner and after the kid is in bed) we sit down and make a plan for the evening, including what we want/need to get done (housework, school work, an episode of a show we like) but first and foremost, when and how are we going to make time for physical intimacy. For us, the best policy is to start there - give it at least 45 minutes of just being in bed naked together cuddling and talking. Sometimes we go in explicitly planning to have sex, other times we just plan to cuddle and see where it leads. Sometimes we browse a little porn on the phone (but that kind of depends on how I'm feeling, I have a weird relationship to porn use). No work talk, to kid talk - we talk about the future, we talk about our relationship, we avoid arguments in favour of talking about things that make us happy, and things we appreciate about each other, and make a point of saying how nice it is to just be alone together snuggling. If we get off topic we try to be mindful and table that conversation for later so we can stay focused on being together. Sometimes we just lie there quietly and read, with my head on his shoulder, or spooning him. There is usually a fair bit of kissing. Often this leads to sex, but not always, and that's ok too, because cuddling is also awesome. Sometimes it will lead to one or the other of us simply masturbating while the other one watches/helps, or reads, or rests beside him/her.

After about 45-90 mins, we are usually feeling much better about life, and flooded with Oxycontin, and can decide where to go from there. Smoke a bowl, have a drink, watch a show, work on a game, read for school, etc. 

You can talk all you want about how you want to have more sex. But unless you actually schedule the opportunity into your life every day, without fail, because it's a priority for you, it won't happen. That's my advice to you. Carve out time to commit to being intimate with each other every day. ",2015-08-26 14:33:15+00:00,cug9z20,1.0,t3_3igpxw,4197.0,DeadBedrooms

4659,"&gt; It's equal rights. The right to live is the same right a woman has.

No its not. No other living thing has the right to live off of the bodily resources of another. If you woke up to find you were hooked to another person as their only blood supply, you would be within your rights to sever that connection and keep your blood for yourself. If some complete stranger needed your kidney to live, you would be free to keep you kidney - you are not compelled to donate. You don't even have to donate it after you die, if you don't want to, even though it's of zero use to you at that point. Under no other circumstances is any person obliged to provide bodily resources like oxygen or expend energy or physically house another being just because that being has a ""right to life."" 

Even someone who drives drunk, hits a car carrying a child, and turns out to be a donor match that could save that child's like by donating just a lobe of liver, cannot be compelled to do so because even they have a right to preserving bodily autonomy and integrity. 

So no, it's not equal rights. You can't have equal rights when you are fighting over the same resources. Choosing in favour of one means choosing against the other.

Nope. That person is already brain dead and therefore completely dead in any meaningful sense of the word. Brain dead is the legal definition of death, and also the only one that makes any sense at all. Who you are is all in your brain. Once that's gone, you are gone forever, and only your remains are left behind, in some state of death, since all of life is a process toward the inevitability of death.

A clump of cells is not a person yet. An acorn is not an oak tree. A future person cannot supercede the personhood of someone who is already fully alive. 

As long as women do not have the right to abort, they will always remain second class citizens without the freedom of bodily self-determination. 

Edit: And actually, if you want to give up your child for adoption because you cannot care for them yourself, you can. So the parents in your absurd and completely irrelevant example actually do have options that a pregnant women doesn't have, because we can't transplant embryos. So if you consider abortion to be murder, how about instead of restricting constitutionally protected rights, try funding better research into ex-utero pregnancy technology. Then everyone wins.

I'll just share one more parting thought:

The !Kung bushman use the euphemism ""work"" to talk about sex between husband and wife. They call that a couple's ""work."" We really, really like this metaphor and we try to live it. Sexual intimacy is joyous, fulfilling, transcendent, and bonding like nothing else. But it takes work to make it happen. It takes effort, planning, bravery, vulnerability, mindfulness, generosity, patience, and fortitude. It's work to maintain, but it's worth every ounce of effort.

4706,"My partner and I are both young and divorced - both ex-deadbedrooms. After we put my daughter to bed each night we re-group and make a plan for the evening, and that conversation addresses whether we will smoke or drink more (usually we do), work or school work we need to accomplish, housework that needs doing, recreation we want to do (ie - watching an episode of community, or spending an hour reading a book), and, always, when and how we are going to make time for intimacy. That doesn't have to include sex, but often it will lead to it. In our experience, if we want to have sex we should set aside time before we do anything else. It's the first priority, and tv, games, reddit, reading, getting high all comes after. But sometimes we aren't ready, so we will wait until later. Then it's hit or miss whether I'll even be sober enough to consent, or we'll be awake enough to manage it. When we discuss it, we also talk about what we want - sometimes he's not up for sex, but he wants to masturbate with me. Often that just turns into taking turns giving each other oral because it's hard for me to watch him masturbate without wanting to suck him off. Sometimes he's too stressed and wired to commit to sex, but is interested in cuddling, so we cuddle. Sometimes it leads to sex, sometimes it's just cuddling. I find that the less pressure I put on him, the better. Cuddling is still awesome. 

My point is - you need to not only talk about it, but make time in your schedule and make it a priority, not an afterthought. Dishes can wait. TV can wait. Work can wait. You are home together, you can set down the devices and focus on being together, even if it's only for 45 mins. It will help tremendously to break down those barriers and provide space and time for that intimacy to lead to sex when you want it to. 

This is my advice. A healthy, satisfying sex life takes commitment and effort, it doesn't just happen. ",2015-08-25 01:59:01+00:00,cueme0t,3.0,t1_cuejrzd,4245.0,DeadBedrooms

The good news is, she does actually like sex, she just doesn't like some part of the process of getting ready to have sex. That's what you should be focused on. 

Maybe she has a hard time turning off her brain to focus on being intimate. Maybe the emotional intimacy is scary for her. Maybe the way you all have sex doesn't involve enough emotional intimacy, and just feels too carnal and that makes her feel used. Maybe she just needs a lot longer build up - starting in the morning, with messages all day, leading up to sex at the end of the evening. 

You don't have to give up hope - but you need to understand what it is that keeps her from getting to the point where she is having sex and enjoying it.

&gt; The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a limited time.

I have been ruminating on these verses because while I find this way to frame human sexuality as a giving act that you share with your partner very compelling, this verse is problematic in that is seems to undermine bodily autonomy and the need for consent between partners. And yet, my atheist bf and I really love this verse and we consider it often when we think about what it means to be a pair and to share our sexuality with love and generosity. 

To make peace with the conflict between consent / autonomy and this kind of sexuality as an active gift, we have turned to a little bit of wisdom from the !Kung people of Kalihari, who use the euphemism ""work"" to refer to sex between partners. Children grow up living in one room dwellings with their parents in close quarters (not unlike the intimacy of the shared sleeping lofts of our pioneer ancestors until as recently as the 1800s) so there is a greater awareness of your parents sexuality in those conditions. The children are taught that this is part of the work their parents must do as a couple. 

We really, really like this.

So when we reflect on the biblical passage above, we try to think about it not in terms of compromising autonomy and consent, but in terms of a shared responsibility to engage sexually with each other because that is part of the hard (but fun!) work of being a couple.

In terms of sheer numbers of individuals, many insect species are vastly more successful than humans. But if we look at adaptations that make it possible for a species to better survive major changes in ecological condition (and, indeed, to influence those conditions), then humans are among the more successful species on the planet. And that's a better measure, imo, because adaptations are always measured as adaptive or maladaptive in reference to the organisms survival within a given set of ecological conditions. That's how a mutation that starts out maladaptive (like lighter weight bones in a tree climbing lizard, which would make them more susceptible to breaks) becomes a helpful adaptation as ecological changes requires more leap and glide hunting in order to find food - eventually leading to flight.

But in the simplest terms, any species that has emerged or survived to this point us presently successful.


I think the word fallacy still applies even if we don't consider it a formal fallacy - the logic failure is concluding that order cannot arise from chaos and therefore needs to have been pre-programmed. But where would the preprogramming come from? Where does the watchmaker's complexity derive from? 

You ask how order emerges out of chaos - we don't fully understand. It happens with fireflies pulsing, it happens with heart cells throbbing, it happens with ants ans bees (i suggest you listen to the Radiolab podcast episode called: Emergence for a layman's overview of it.) Now, saying ""we don't fully understand"" is dissatisfactory for many - they will say that therefore it cannot be known or it makes the most sense for this to be the work of a creator. And *that* is the God-of-the-Gaps argument. 

So your options for explaining how free-floating components in the primordial ooze coalesced into functioning single cells organisms are 

* a) order cannot emerge from chaos, all systems are entropic by nature, and complexity is evidence of design (the watchmaker fallacy - because the presupposition is false)

* b) order emerges out of chaos but we cannot understand the mechanism, therefore it must be a guiding hand (the God-of-the-Gaps theory)

Or 

* c) we observe that order emerges from chaos, and complexity from simplicity, but we do not yet understand the mechanism. We should study this a whole lot more and see what else we can learn (operating on the presupposition that the material world is knowable)",2015-08-15 15:27:52+00:00,cu3xvxs,9.0,t1_cu3p7ul,30902.0,Christianity

And before we start to suggest that that only proves a guiding hand - order emphatically does emerge from chaos.

4789,"&gt; Today she asked if we could have scrambled eggs, and I said sure, if you make it. Then she had a fit because she couldn't do that. I told her that I will teach you, and she got sour. I was nice and positive all the way, I'm very avare of not being condescending to her. She insisted that to make scrambled eggs you only heated a pan and tossed some eggs on it and them mixed it, and I told her I wanted to show her how most people make it. By cracking eggs in a bowl, mix it with milk, salt, pepper etc. So she reluctantly did it, giving me attitude, telling me how she was a master chef (while I had to show her how to wisk the eggs), she told me my way was stupid, how she would never use it again, and was just mean. After the eggs are cooked in the pan she tells me my way is boring and it was boring to make, and boring to cook, and I could do it for her next time. Then she eats it and praise herself for her fine cooking. I'm just.... What?

1 ) Sometimes people make requests of you because they want to reassure themselves that you are still available to help them. You rejected her, so maybe that felt like a bigger rejection than it really was.

2) Teaching is great - but you also need to let people try stuff out for themselves. What would have happened if she had done it her way? She would have probably burnt them, but you know, you actually can make scrambled eggs without milk, and maybe it would have worked out fine, and you could have given her a little face for figuring out a different way to solve her own problem.

3) She's going through puberty. She will be flooded with hormones and acting like people do when they are flooded with hormones. The other times in your life when you are this overwhelmed by new and ever changing surging chemicals in your brain are when you are a toddler and when you are pregnant. So if she is acting a little bit like an emotionally distraught, irrational pregnant toddler, that might have more to do with hormones than your parenting. She is feeling her emotions in real time - she is only just acquiring the cognitive capacity to reflect on her behaviors and feelings. Helping her to talk about it might help, but it's not uncommon for 12-15 years olds to just be very hard to live with for a while. It won't last forever.

All of that said - she's being quite awful to you. But my suspicion is that she is under a lot of emotional stress at home, and sometimes the worse they treat you, the more they need you. Its not about the cooking. It's not about the food. It's probably about feeling like she has little control over her life, and living with a manipulative and emotionally draining parent who is not meeting her needs. So maybe she needs a little extra coddling as she adjusts to being with you all again. But in the long run, your instincts are correct - she is lashing out because she wants to find where the boundaries are. Children need boundaries, and crave them.

4791,"&gt; bond between mother and child should be sacred

Its easy to talk about a metaphysical ""bond"" but what do you actually mean by that? You can't force a bond. Bonding doesn't just happen. It's a psychological process that begins after birth, when you meet each other for the first time. Some women never bond with their offspring properly, or struggle to for years. This is especially true if you definitely don't want that child in the first place. There is nothing automatic about it. There is no inherent deep, meaningful connection between the host and the invading organism. Even for women who choose to get pregnant and choose to keep the child one it's born, there isn't necessarily any kind of emotional connection to the entity that's growing inside of them. 

Besides, you can't set religion aside if you are going to use loaded terms like ""sacred"" which is a made up concept reinforced by religious and spiritual belief systems and not a measurable or agreed upon attribute. It's a concept borrowed from religion. 

What I don't understand is how you think forcing women to be unwilling incubators and putting their own health and life as risk is not extremely immoral? I'm not taking morality out of it *at all*. I think legal abortion is a social good, and a morally right choice. 

&gt; My concern with this statement is that now it seems like a darwin issue. You want to remove yourself from the genepool? 

But most women who choose abortion have emphatically not removed from themselves from the gene pool, because they have already passed on their genes to others in the form of their children. They just don't want to have any more of them. And for anyone who has an abortion because they intend to never have children at all, they are effectively removing themselves as well, why should that need to entail their death also? Surely that's a loss for the species in the form of lost labor to society, if we want to be all darwinian about it.

4812,"&gt; It's relevant here that I've had three kids and during each pregnancy I never felt like this was still ""my body"" and thus ""my choice"" but that I had another human growing inside of me...

I've had a kid, but I never felt that there was another human inside me. It felt like a weird, uncomfortable invasion. When it moved, I felt sick. It was creepy and awful, and I was keeping the pregnancy. But I never felt anything remotely like a connection to the entity inside me. It was an invasive organism and I couldn't wait to get it out. That entity was eventually born and is now my lovely 7 year old daughter, but I still say ""it"" when I talk about the pregnancy. So..... your feelings are valid for you, but not for everyone. Imagine how horrifying and miserable it would be to have something growing inside you that you do not want in there and would do anything to get rid of? How horrific and grotesque is it to force someone to be incubate a foreign entity against their will and at the risk of their life and future health consequences. There is, for me, no better word than grotesque.

Rather than address the personhood issue, or the consequences for your actions issue, I'm just going to point out that unless abortion is legal, women will die inflicting it on themselves. Women are already buying abortion drugs illegally and administering it themselves, and some of them will die as a result of lack of follow up care. Others will seek out other forms of abortion, by shoving implements inside of themselves. Some will commit suicide. When you are pregnant and you desperately want to not be pregnant, you will do anything it takes. The drive to terminate will lead people to extreme measures. 

So, do we want those women to die, or not? Because if not, then we should continue to facilitate (and, imo, actively fund) abortion services for anyone who wants/needs them. Restricting access has never at any point in history ever lowered the rate of abortions. It only makes them more dangerous to obtain.

4819,"I chose SMU because I wanted a strong liberal arts education (I double majored in English and Anthropology.) It's also really easy to double major at SMU - nearly everyone who is serious does it. It's not unheard of for people to triple major, in fact, though in my graduating class in 2011 I think there were only a handful. So that was a big draw.

I'll be honest though, I never seriously considered UTD as an undergraduate, even though I might have fit in well - I was older, and I had a small child: I definitely didn't fit the normal SMU profile. But I loved SMU. I worked on campus the whole time I was a student, I loved my professors, and I loved the campus. Also - my grandfather used to teach at SMU, and my aunt and uncle went there, so I have some ties to it that are not purely academic.

That said, I have ties to UTD as well - my current partner actually runs a dept in student support services, he's also a grad student there, and I plan to start a different grad program in the spring. My ex-bf was an engineering major there, my cousin went there for a while, and my daughter goes to their summer coding camps. Its a lovely school, and the diversity of the student body makes me feel right at home (I grew up overseas). I go up there to visit for lunch or attend evening lectures/events/concerts fairly often now that I'm dating a staff member, and it's always pleasant. 

It seems like an apples and oranges comparison in many ways - because you are comparing a public STEM school with a private liberal arts school. They are very different in many ways. There are other things to consider when you are choosing between them: for example, what you want to major in and who the professors are at either school teaching what you want to study. And then there is the financial question: a state school is cheaper by far. I had lots of aide because of my grades, test scores, and financial need as an impoverished young parent, but I still walked away with debt that I'm paying off. The SMU debt management is harsh - if you end up in collections they will put a permanent hold on your account until it's paid off - that could mean you are barred from graduate school because you can't release your transcripts. On the other hand - depending on the field - you will meet a lot of interesting and influential people in DFW who are SMU alumni and living here I've found my academic record and connections have helped tremendously.

4830,"I believe abortion and birth control to be essential basic healthcare services. I believe its a social good with measurable positive effects on quality of life for women and families. More than 60% of women who access abortion services already have children at home for whom they are responsible. When it's legal and available, abortion is a safe and simple option that at least 1/3 women will access (and probably more will need) at some time in their menstrual lives, between the ages of 11.5 and 52. 

I'm pro-abortion. I don't think it's wrong or sad or anything to apologize or tip-toe around. Its just a medical service, and 80% of them are just a pill that induces a heavy period. Obviously better sex-ed and contraception would reduce the number of abortions, but that is, imo, just a bi-product, not the goal in itself. The goal is to improve the lives of sexually active people of all ages, and their families. 

Abortion will always be needed because unplanned pregnancies happen. Birth-control fails. Abortion has also always been available for women throughout human history, and has only been subject to legal and legislative restrictions in the last few hundred years.

4859,"Well.... more like psychology. I'm trying to explain that Riddle didn't *need* to AK Harry in order to kill him, but that he was compelled by his own inner narrative to make the murder symbolically important. And by doing that, he actually empowered Harry and laid the groundwork for his own destruction.

If I wanted to apply logic to the magic I'd have to explore why Lily Potter's self-sacrifice was enough to prevent the murder, because surely someone somewhere had tried that before, to no avail. Why was this particular attempt to shield someone from an AK so effective? And I suspect that answer lies in the very same issue - that this wasn't intended to be a run-of-the-mill killing curse, but a ritualistic murder that, whether on purpose or accidentally, actually resulted in the creation of a horcrux. That process is, presumably, magically different and its possible that no one had ever attempted to self-sacrifice in the face of magic quite so dark, since of course horcrux creation is exceptionally rare and requires considerable magical prowess, and certainly the creations of successive horcruxes may have had some influence on the uniqueness of those circumstances as well.

4863,"&gt; You really should not need the most powerful killing spell to deal with an infant.

This right here though, is Riddle's great fault, and it's perfectly compliant with his character - he may not have *needed* to use an unforgivable curse to murder Harry, but believed he needed it in order to mark the murder as ritually significant, because he's imaging himself as part of this epic narrative, and baby Harry as a prophesied threat to him. But as we learn, those things are only true because of the choices that Riddle makes himself. *He* narrativizes his rise to power and glory and an epic battle and *by choosing* Harry as the prophesied child, and by marking him ""as his equal"" by trying to kill him in a ritual way (and in so-doing, making inadvertently making the final horcrux) using a super powerful curse, he unwittingly actually makes Harry an equal of his, giving him some of his own powers and the only way to finally defeat him. His hubris and obsession of with ritualized murder (following the creation of 7 prior horcruxes that we also produced through highly ritualized and symbolic murders of specifically chosen people) is what results in his own downfall in the end.

Of course he could have just smothered him, but that wouldn't have reinforced his delusion of grandeur and fulfilled his need for validation from the universe that power and glory were his destiny and due, and his genuine blood-lust and sadistic pleasure at ritual killing were, by then, so deeply ingrained in his character and identity (and what remained of his soul) that he couldn't have conceived of doing it any other way. He *needed* that murder to be significant and performed it ritualistically because of the way he had constructed his whole identity by that point.

She's in a wonderful Montessori school with a tiny student/teacher ratio, personalized instruction, supplemental programs, mixed age classrooms, lots of wonderful friends, and she's surrounded by rational liberal secularists, which is extremely rare in Texas. We love it, and we plan to send our future children to montessori schools as well, ideally this specific school, if we stay in this city. We are very close with the other families, because the school builds a real sense of community, with biannual weekend-long camping trips and lots of other activities, etc. I know every single one of her lower elementary classmates and their parents and all of their siblings (and sometimes their extended family) personally, along with all 12 of the teachers and administrative staff (and their spouses and children) and about 85% of all the students and parents of the other 4 classes (3 preschool class rooms and the upper elementary class) at least by name, and they know me. That's exceptionally rare.

If we move her, it will probably to a public montessori school that has recently opened nearby, but we want to see how it goes for some of her friends who are moving up there. Or to a STEM magnate, which she would love, but those don't start till 3rd or 4th grade anyway. 

It's not just about the excellent teachers, it's about being part of a community of friends and families. I wouldn't move her until after 3rd grade if it was up to me, but financial demands are changing. I can handle the cost fine if it's just the two of us, or even the three of us.

These arguments are not hard to undermine though. However, in the US, it has been the standard practice for a long time, as an elective medical procedure with no religious significance at all.

Where did it start? That's a long story, but it involved the Kellogg guy (that's right, the corn flakes guy) and the goal was originally quite simple: circumcision was supposed to make it harder for males to masturbate, which at the time (mid 1800s) was believed to leech your life force. Seriously.

It's a harmful practice propped up by weak medical justification and based originally on pseudo-science and Victorian sexual purity culture. It's not religious, though, for almost anyone. Except among observant Jews.

Your parents probably didn't think twice. I bet you dad was cut, and his dad, and his dad. And all the men in your family. The doctor told them they should do it, and they listened to the doctor and didn't think twice. ",2015-08-06 02:37:43+00:00,ctt518i,3.0,t1_ctt4d1m,1165.0,exchristian
4908,"So... here's the thing about mental illness: not all forms of psychological abnormality, irrational thought, compulsion, delusion, phobias, or even hallucination, are harmful or interfere with the normal function of your daily life. It's only when the given symptoms or syndrome is causing significant distress to the patient, interfering with their intimate and familial relations, puts others at risk, or inhibits their ability to engage in self-care, retain gainful employments, and be a productive member of society, and this persists for an extended period of time (varies by diagnosis) that the condition is diagnosible and treatable, and even then the goal is not to eliminate all disordered thinking, but to help the patient recognize this and avoid harmful behaviours that reinforce it. 

So.... yes: I would argue that religious belief is a form of shared delusion, sure. But does it rise, de facto, to the level of mental illness? No. However, religious delusions and hallucinations may manifest as symptoms of more severe psychotic disorders, and exposure to religious fundamentalism can absolutely exacerbate existing co-morbid conditions like mood disorders, psychosis, etc. ",2015-08-06 02:29:48+00:00,ctt4rem,1.0,t3_3fw7ll,34719.0,exchristian

Yes, that's true, but few even have the option because the US doesn't guarantee maternity *or* paternity leave for it's citizens. 

&gt; It doesn't promise equal status, only equal rights.

And that is why, to answer the OPs question, egalitarianism is grouped with MRA - it doesn't just ""not promise"" equal status, is actively preserves existing inequalities. 

&gt; it means you will be given the chance to do the best that you can, regardless of your race, gender, or sexual orientation

It doesn't work like that. Disadvantages like poverty literally change the way your brain works. By supporting equal rights without any effort to facilitate equity, we absolutely preserve and perpetuate existing income, race, and gender inequality.

Gender relations between males and females in primate species who are not particularly sexually dimorphic (and humans actually are not particularly dimorphic as a species) tend to be more egalitarian in many ways, though it varies widely. Hunter/gatherer societies are still like this today - there is some degree of division of labour but there is no ownership of others as property, and women are free to reproduce with whomever, as there is no paternity issue. The whole concept of paternity is a function of patriarchy.

Asking for sex and begining intimacy always involved getting fairly explicit verbal consent from each other, but it's sexy the way we do it. I love that when he comes to kiss me after getting me off with oral, how he whispers, ""do you want me to fuck you now?"" into my ear. I always reply enthusiastically that I do. We communicate about what works and make time to fit sexual intimacy into our schedules as a priority as close to daily as possible. We take time for foreplay because we both need it in order to enjoy the sex. We are very emotionally intimate and vulnerable with each other before and after, and so it serves to cement our connection, not just fulfill sexual needs, though that is obviously very important. 

We are intellectual equals but our respective bodies of knowledge, experience, and career expertise, while mutually interesting, do not actually overlap more than 30%. For example, we majored in the same subject, and share some hobbies, but our career paths have been utterly divergent and many of our hobbies are new to the other person. This allows us to take turns sharing new things, being the expert, and teaching each other. I'm teaching him a new language right now, and he is teaching me more than I ever could have learned on my own about video games and game theory/mechanics/history/development. My second major is in physical anthropology so I basically majored in human evolution, and he minored in voice, so we get high and I talk about evolutionary theory and then he plays guitar and sings whatever he's been working on. We complement each other well, just without a hierarchy.

He's really cool, and smart, and funny. And he thinks I'm cool, and smart, and funny. We are genuinely best friends. And we are happy.

5033," A human female has not attained her full adult body until later in her adolescence. Her bones have not finished growing, and it is dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy. It can cause permanent damage to her skeletal system. Pregnancy loosens the joints throughout your body by affecting the way your ligaments grow. It can cause her joint problems for the rest of her life, if she carries a pregnancy before she is ready. And that is just one of  many examples. The early onset of menstruation is a feature of human life today, but has not been historically. Onset of menstruation used to be much much later in your life. It can happen earlier as a result of malnutrition or the influence of hormones. We know this because we can actually look back and see the age of onset throughout human history because its pretty well recorded. In 1850, the average age was 16.6 months. Which means 50 percent of girls actually got their period later than that,  some as late as 19 or 20 years old. Today, the average age is 11.5 years. With some children menstrating as early as 8 years old. An 8 year old who gets her period is not an adult by any stretch of anyone's imagination. No measure would consider that individual an adult.

* If you believe in works-based salvation (salvation through works, in faith) then your salvation Is dependent on actions you take (like sacraments, confession, communion, and charitable acts like tithing, etc) and if you don't do these, you can't be saved, because ""faith without works is dead.""

* If you believe in faith-based salvation (salvation by faith alone), then all you need to do is believe in Jesus/God/the Plan of Salvation to be saved, and anyone can be saved by their faith alone. That will probably result in good works because of your faith, but those works aren't affecting your salvation. You are saved by your faith, the way so many people are healed by Jesus ""because of [their] faith."" 

* If you believe in grace-based salvation (salvation by grace alone), then you are saved only by God's grace, because he has chosen you to be one of his Chosen or Elect, through nothing you have ever done or believed. This is a core tenet of reformed theology, which is based on 5 principles, which i would gladly expound upon later, if you like, but for now, it's just important to know that if you saved by grace alone, nothing you do can alter your status as saved or not saved, but because of the doctrine of Irresistible Grace, you will at some point believe in God if you are among the chosen, and that is how you can know you are saved.

* Grace alone ^^reformed ^^theology

* works (with faith) ^^catholicism ^^and ^^eastern ^^orthodox

you can be saved from death *through the only available mechanism*, per the Law, which his Jesus' saving death and resurrection.


So, if you accept that God's laws exist and govern the world, then God is just because he follows those laws and applies them universally.

But if you believe that other laws govern the universe, or another moral framework should be imposed (like, that people are naturally good and that all people deserve a chance at heaven, etc) then yeah, God would appear wholly unjust to you.

I hate to break your bubble but thats definitively not the case. There are almost no nerve endings inside the vagina at all. There are some along the very first inch or so, but the rest of the birth canal has no nerve endings. Vaginal orgasms are actually clitoral orgasms - pressure from penetration stimulates the base of the clitoris, which attaches at the pelvic bone. The clitoris is extremely sensitive - way, way more than the glans penis, and even more than the very sensitive male foreskin. But the vagina isnt. There are, by contrast, many many more nerve endings in the anus.

Why, you might ask? It would be maladaptive for the human birth canal to be lined with nerve endings. Childbirth is bad enough as it is. Whereas, for your health and fecal retention, you need to able to feel objects in and around your anus.

And they claim that this is based on evolutionary psychology, which is BS. They have no refined understanding of primate or early human behavior at all they are working with the most rudimentary understanding of animal societies. If we were close relatives of dogs, it might make sense. But primates? nope.  First of all, primate mating behavior varies tremendously, ranging from monogamy to (gasp!) polyandry (MMF is the preferred family structure for tamarins, dyk?).

Even if we narrow down to our closest relatives, Chimps, their theories don't hold up. Despite popular belief, there is **no consistent mating advantage to being an alpha chimp**. In fact, females will frequently evade alpha males while in estrous, and sneak off to mate with the betas because they are better mates and parents. Its an evolutionary advantage NOT to be an alpha, because a) you're more like to successfully mate and b) you're less likely to die in a stupid fight for superiority.

But try talking to them about actual primatology and they plug their ears and repeat their mantras.

But remember, we're talking about onset here, so this is no where near a fully developed and operational reproductive system. But you are not wrong - in times with worse nutrition or more stress, menarche (on-set of menstruation) was lower as well, typically 13-15 in the middle ages and renaissance. Still not as low as it is today, though.

This has been a hotly debated topic in the exmormon community in the past year, following the LDS church finally acknowledging Joseph Smith's plural wives, of whom several were underage, and at least 2 were 14 years old! Apologists claim that women married and had kids younger back in the 19th century, but it's simply not true. The average age of menarche was way higher and the average age of at marriage was 19-23.5.

But I admire her tremendously for her incredible spirit of love and generosity, and most importantly, forgiveness.

Last year, she found out that a friend from her Church bible study group had been filming her and other girls, as they changed and used the bathroom at his apartment while visiting to swim in his pool. She found out when the police contacted her after his roommate caught on and turned him in. She had to file a report, and actually turn up to court to press charges.

When I spoke to her about it, it was late November, a few months after the violation came to light. I had reached out to her in pain over other things happening in my life (addiction related) and she was there for me. It only came out later that this had been going on for her that year. At that point, he was in jail, and would be sentenced to additional community service and fines. She told me she had already sent him a card for his birthday that week, and had told him that she forgave him. I asked her why? She told me: I think Jesus is teaching me about forgiveness and love this year. I forgave [guy] and sent him a card, because it's the Christian thing to do. But doing the loving thing does not mean that I don't hold him accountable for his actions. I pressed charges against him, because that, too, is the loving thing. I have forgiven him in my heart, but I still expect him to take responsibility for what he has done and make repayment to society for his wrongs. That is part of his journey of repentance.

It gave me pause, as I thought about the bitterness that I still carry in my heart for my ex-husband, who bullied and terrified, and eventually assaulted me. I have moved past that time in my life, for the most part, but I have not forgiven him. And I have not forgiven myself, either.

I hope, one day, to hold enough love in my heart to live this kind of loving forgiveness even when (and especially when) it is so hard to do.

You can [find a congregation here](http://www.episcopalchurch.org/find-a-church).

There are also other Christian churches and denominations who are affirming and supportive of same-sex unions. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of America also has a similar policy. And the Presbyterian Church (PC-USA) has recently relaxed their definition of marriage to be ""two people, traditionally a man and a woman"" (but not exclusively!). The Unitarian Universalists also embrace same-sex unions and are way more progressive in most areas, than other denominations. And I'm pretty sure the Disciples of Christ are affirming also. Here is a list of many [gay-friendly churches](http://www.gaychurch.org/affirming-denominations/), whose support comes in varying degrees.

You can still be a believing Christian if you want to be, and be a part of a faith community, without having to compromise what is best for you, or live alone without a partner.

You are better off with someone who shares your core beliefs. If she is not a believer and does not value your preference to wait until marriage, then you will be in conflict a lot, and that is not a good foundation for a marriage.

I addressed this elsewhere recently but it bears repeating:


&gt; So, I'm a secular Episcopalian, and my SO is an ex-Calvinist. I couldn't say that our relationship has helped my ""religious life"" exactly, but I has helped my irreligious life, and it's been really good for me.

&gt; Bear with me.

&gt; What I mean is, he and I share a set of deeply held convictions. They are not religious convictions, though some are derived from our christian upbringing. We believe certain things, like that reality is basically deterministic and the universe is knowable. We believe we should always seek to treat others with love, and we expect it of each other. It's extremely validating for me to share certain fundamental beliefs about the nature of reality in the same way that for a believing Christian, faith in the Salvation of Christ is a core part of your identity, and you are happiest and most fulfilled with someone who also sees the world that way, and can be moved to sudden reverence in the Glory of Creation when you sit together in the porch, in the same way that my boyfriend and I gaze at the stars and consider the wondrous improbability of human existence.When in awe, our minds drift to the same place. That synchronicity of mind and heart is a beautiful thing, and it reflects the true wisdom of the biblical advice not to be ""unevenly yoked."" Because to be evenly-yoked, is a beautiful thing.

5348,"Not a Calvinist but this is one systematic theology I understand fairly well. Also my SO is an ex-Calvinist:

&gt; Before the foundation of the world, God appointed a select few out of the billions of people that would ever live to be the ""Elect"", meaning they were chosen by God to be saved. Everyone else who isn't chosen by God is destined to Hell. 

All of creation exists for the glorification of God. But, I mean, everything else in creation dies, so why shouldn't humans? We are, afterall, Totally Depraved. We say ""destroyed"" and get all indignant, but if all of creation is just for the purpose of glorifying God, and all of creation is Fallen and deserves to die, then it's actually a tremendous mercy that God elects anyone to survive. 

&gt; Now, (again correct me if I'm wrong), but according to the Calvinists, it's the sinner fault for going to hell, even though God didn't choose them to be the elect, therefore they weren''t meant to be saved.

It's not exactly the sinner's fault in the way you are thinking. Nothing the sinner did in any way affected his status as unelect. Its not a works-based salvation theology, and that goes both ways. No person's works can save or unsave them. Only Grace. The unelect are not God's chosen, and therefore they cannot be saved from the consequences of their Total Depravity. Only the Elect can be saved through Christ's Limited Atonement (limited, because although it was sufficient to cover the sins of all people, it is only effective at saving the elect, because only they will truly believe the Gospel and be able to accept the gift of Salvation). 

&gt; So does this mean that God creates certain people just so that he can destroy them to display his glory?

He creates us all for his own glory. We inherit Original Sin and are Totally Depraved, so we don't deserve more than to live and then to die. So yes, some people are created for God's glory and will die at the end of their lives. But that's not a ""display."" Its just the rule. Its exceptionally loving and merciful that God makes it possible for anyone to transcend those boundaries and be saved. The POV you have to take on for this to work is utter humility. If you feel like you or anyone else *deserves* to be saved for being a good person, or believing, or anything else, then you are operating from a works-based theological framework. Its only when you can embrace a frame that all persons are totally depraved and none of us is deserving of salvation, and only through the exceptional grace of God are some number of us able to be saved. 

&gt; Does this contradict the notion that God loves everyone and he actually hates the reprobate and only loves those who are the ""Elect""?

God can love the reprobate and still not give them eternal life. If they are unelect, they are simply ineligible for salvation. But God blesses all of this children with gifts, starting with the gift of life. Who are we to be upset that the life we are blessed with is only mortal?

&gt; If God does hate sinners, then why did Jesus treat them better than everyone else around him??

God is simply Just. The rules say, if you are in sin, the wages are death. Christ died to cover those wages, but it can only save the Elect, because only the Elect will truly believe in the Gospel and live lives pleasing to God, and so only they will be able to accept Christ's saving gift and be saved.

5366,"So, I'm not demisexual really, I just subscribe because I subscribe to all the GSM subs. But I will say that I relate in that, although I'm rather indiscriminately sexually attracted to people, I'm not able to actually experience sexual pleasure within the range of anywhere near orgasm unless I'm deeply in love with the person and in a good place with them in the relationship, feeling very close and trusting and safe. 


But - like I said - I definitely do feel sexual attraction to others, and it's fairly indiscriminate, particularly because I'm bisexual. I'm more attracted to women than men, but I vastly prefer men as my partners.

Anyway..... sometimes my darling SO wonders whether I'm truly attracted to him, because he's not a pretty 18 yo girl. Quite apart from wanting to say I feel the same way, since I'm also no spring chicken, i typically articulate my attraction to him very, very bluntly.

""Sometimes, when I look at you, I just want to touch you all over and put your genitals in my mouth.""

And that's pretty much it. It's not that I, personally, feel aroused (although I do, but attraction is more than that). It's that I want to touch you everywhere and make you feel amazing. And that how I feel about all the people I'm attracted to. I just don't actually act on it all the time. And I don't personally get any gratification unless we're deeply in love.

5401,"Yes, please provide any academic literature to suggest that any species could return to fully repopulate with only two initial individuals. I would enjoy reading that. I'm not making any assumptions, I'm speaking from the experience we have today with species that are considered effectively extinct once the number of individuals drops to a level at which the diversity of their gene pool can no longer sustain them, and that's typically under fifty (25 mated pairs). A single mated pair is nowhere near enough. However, I would not expect you to understand this part if you reject evolution, because the necessity for genetic diversity within the gene pool is incomprehensible without evolutionary theory. 

What am I making up about animals having to travel to get to the Ark? Does Noah not take two of each kind? Or does the bible just refer to a local flood and some local species? But that cant be, if the whole world has to be wiped out. So did God just magic them into the dessert? And them magic them back to their respective continents? 

Those ""other cultures"" you refer to as decendents of Noah? They settled around the world going back way, way further than the biblical flood of 2300 BC. Egypt was an empire, China was an empire. There were people living in North America who had been there between 12k and 20k years before. People were begining to populate the Polynesian islands by boat from South America, per some research. People were living all over Europe already, including an early settlement as far north as Scotland. There were empires in India and Iran. Massive monuments are being erected. Architectural advances abound. Medicine is being explored. Written language has developed in many forms. Those cultures not only survived through whatever flood the bible is referring to, but they vastly pre-date the biblical Hebrew people and we're certainly more technologically advanced at that time. 

&gt; If it's all just so many fables, there's really no point in hanging on to ANY of it, and you certainly can't say you believe the Bible.

That makes no sense to me, at all. Why would you discard the whole texts because it contains fables, poetry, allegory, and myth? Why do you denigrate those forms of art and literature? Can they not also be inspired and of value even if they are not literally true? The concept of biblical exceptionalism baffles me. 

I have looked into it. Clearly you have too. We are just looking at different sources. I cannot say I have ever encountered a single shred of evidence to suggest that anything referred in the creation story or the flood story are literally true.

It's the single unifying theory that holds together everything we know about biology. If we need to limit ourselves to what we can physically observe, we have through out most of physics, biology, pretty much all of chemistry, certainly a lot of modern medicine. 

I'm going to set everything else aside and just remark on the biblical flood narrative, since it's a great example: 

Flood myths exist because there are floods. It floods all around the world, and continues to today. That's not the same thing as a single catastrophic flood that wiped out every living thing not on the Ark and reduced the gene pool of every species to just a few individuals. If that had happened, land mammals as we know them would not have been able to replenish their numbers, as there would not have been enough individuals to sustain a diverse enough gene pool to propagate the species. The story has to be either a vast exaggeration or an allegory. It can't be literally true without a lot of additional divine intervention for those species to survive. 

Besides - the argument that other cultures around the world have flood myths does little to support the biblical claim, since those other cultures would need to have been completely wiped out by that very flood.

Anyway, if a kangaroo could swim across the ocean from Australia just to get on a boat for a month, why not just let it swim it out, since it would have taken more than twice as long to swim to Noah in the first place. The same would be true for polar bears and hummingbirds and earthworms, and scarab beetles.


Honestly, it's so obviously just an old fable passed down through Hebrew oral history. It explains what rainbows are, and ties it to faith in God. Just like every other myth in the bible and in other sacred and secular story telling traditions. How can we look at other fables, and call them just fables, and then look at the same kinds of stories in this text, and claim that they are not only from God, but are literally true historical accounts? When the people writing them themselves had little concept of historical accuracy, and made a practice of narrativising and embellishing stories. 


&gt; There's no point to any of it if Christ didn't literally die, and didn't literally rise 3 days later.

But why? How is spiritual resurrection less remarkable? How is that not still an amazing thing? Why in a million years would you want your own resurrection to be bodily? Why? I don't get it. 

But more importantly: why is ""salvation from death"" more important than the task to seek and serve Christ in others and bring about the kingdom of heaven on earth? Why is it so important to try to save yourself from the inevitability of death, but not to love others *simply because it's the right thing to do* and for no other reason?

5408,"&gt; I'd say if you could demonstrate that a part of the Bible were false, the whole thing is a cohesive whole that can then be chucked out.

This is a complete non sequitor for me. Why? Why does the whole thing have to be perfectly cohesive and true or its all rubbish? I don't get that. But i do understand that anyone who has been taught this, and believes it, will naturally cling to the truth claims made in the text no matter what, because they need it to be true. It's all predicated on an idolatrous elevation of the Bible as the inerrant Word of God when it's just a collection of documents. It's *people*  past and present, who are the true witnesses. Its the community of Christ as a whole, not just the text. At least in my denomination.

&gt; Thankfully, there's tons of evidence that all of the things that happened in the Bible happened precisely the way the text describes.

This is false. In fact, there is almost no evidence for most of it. The creation myth, the global flood, the age of the earth, the two lone parents of modern humans, the Exodus out of egypt. There isn't even much evidence to suggest Jesus was a really historical figure, and certainly no evidence for the resurrection. You have to take most of it on faith, there is no evidence to support any of those claims. The only way to consolidate the biblical account is to take it as allegory, or to just deny science.

edit: all of this arises from a claim that death is God's enemy. How is that a problem? So what if God considers death an enemy, death of living things is still a positive and essential part of the life cycle in nature, and no part of our biological reality could ever exist without death in some form within its ecology and food chain.

What about Psalm 116:15? What about any claims about death prior to the Fall. Death comes up in Proverbs, too, and isn't always necessarily about literal death. Indeed the only times it probably is for sure about physical death is all the many times someone is sentenced to death, and even *that* is meaningfully distinct from a reference to spiritual death.

But when a Christian suggests that some parts of the NT can be taken metaphorically, then it's worth at least considering their case, I think, but one should not dismiss another's beliefs a non-Christian just because they don't elevate the biblical text to an idolatrous place. 

As Christians we are called to be humble - maybe it would benefit you to embrace a little humility and be open to the possibility that you might not actually know the answer to this, and that what you believe is based on your personal faith and others' teachings, and that renders it exactly as valid, but no more valid, as beliefs based on the faith and teachings of others.",2015-07-11 23:10:35+00:00,ct04lj0,10.0,t1_ct01miu,6030.0,Christianity

Here's why that's interesting to me. As a Episcopalian, we do a *lot* of ritual stuff. Even our prayer is scripted. But it's also symbolic to us, and while we like the uniformity and repetition, we also understand that it's just a ritual process. 

But we also view a lot of the scripture that way. We don't consider the bible to be inerrant or infallible. We consider it a compiled of inspired texts, but it's not the Literal Word of God and we consider a lot of it to be relevant to another time only, and only the core messages to be relevant to our time now. We treat it like an inspirational text, but don't elevate it in our minds beyond what it is. Some Episcopalians consider the status given to the Bible to be idolatrous.


How is this parallel?


Well, so, while we have a highly restrictive and ritualized worship service, we have a very open-minded perceptive on scripture. Whereas you have a highly bible-focused belief system, but a fairly open-ended worship structure or ritual process.

But whereas we *know* that our ritualized services are just symbolic, churches on the other end of both the liturgical and social spectrum, can't seem to extend symbolism to the biblical text. 

And I think I get why, now, and it has to do with the pleasure of the rigorous logical complexity of constructing a perfectly adherent, self-contained, systematic theology within the confines of a densely complex text.

5463,"May I give you some advice, as a woman with a child from a previous marriage, who is dating? Here are some things to ask and think about, once you've decided to start dating her, and are pretty sure you're compatible:

* First - consider exactly how involved the other parents is, and decide if that is something you can live with.

* Then - you'll need to find out, at some point, what kind of co-parenting, if any, she wants from a partner. Some single parents want to retain sole custody of their child from a previous relationship, or to have the final say on anything regarding that child. Others may envision an involved and legal step parents for their child, and possibly additional children, and to form a blended family together. The latter is what i, personally, want.

* Third - decide if you want to be a parent at all, and in the capacity that this woman needs/wants. Do you envision the same kind of family that she does? And decide if you want to be a parent to additional children, and talk to her about whether and how many she might want.

* Last: get to know her family, and let her get to know yours, if either side is involved in your lives. If she lives with her parents, or you life near your brothers and hang out a lot, make sure you all get along, and you can live with binding yourself to them and with the amount of help/interference they are likely to be in your future family.


However, by the time you have a full picture of the families, the relationship, and the kind of parent this person is and have had a chance to see what kind you might be, you'll have been dating a while, and you'll probably already know if it's going to work out.

A few final thoughts: don't push the process. Have faith that things can turn out well.

5482,"Please, refrain from designating me and my entire denomination as non-Christian, it's against the sub rules. 

You believe that your faith has saved you? What would you say to the many places in scripture that justify salvation by grace alone, and not by faith? What do you say to the passages that indicate a limited atonement? You would say those are antithetical to your beliefs based on your reading of the bible, I imagine. An reformed theologians would consider your confidence in the fact that you are saved by your own faith to be antithetical to theirs. 

Your confidence in your beliefs is nothing short of hubris, when you start to point at others and tell them they are wrong. There is absolutely no way, at all, that anyone can possibly know whether any God even exists. Much less anything else. Your beliefs are based on the presupposition that the Bible is inerrant, and I simply don't accept this presupposition. And I'm not alone, and just because we believe differently than you, does not make us wrong. No one has failed me.

Consider the Episcopal Church's stance on [inerrancy and infallibility](http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/inerrancy-biblical), or this person's discussion of how easy it is to [dispell the claim of inerrancy](https://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~lcrew/dojustice/j152.html). 

And your claims about ""a god you invented"" sounds correct in that that's what *every single believer and every single human religion* is doing. We're all doing that. Whether such a God exists or not, we cannot know. We are all doing our best to conceive of such a being and discern his/her will for us. But we cannot conceive of something that is eternal and transcendent, and so we have created an image of this God, based on our limited imagination.

Yes. No conflict there. I'm not trying differentiate Calvinism in this regard, I'm just explaining where the uncertainly arises in this theology. Obviously there is uncertainty in any. BUT in a faith- or works-based salvation theology, humans can exercise agency to influence their own salvation. You can influence the outcome. In fact, you are obliged to do so, and cannot be saved *unless* you do X, Y, Z. It's not for sure that you will be successful, but it's *possible* for something you choose to do to have an influence on whether or not you are saved. In Calvinism, there is nothing at all that you can do to influence this, and that's what this person's formulation of ""do X and you will be fine"" seems to imply.

5488,"&gt; So once someone has shown genuine faith he is saved?

No, that suggests that his faith saves him, which it doesn't. He was already saved before he had faith, because of Grace, unconditionally. But if he is saved, then he will at some point have faith (because irresistible grace). So if a person shows faith AND it is truly genuine (which none can really know), then he is among the elect, because only the elect can truly have faith (limited atonement).

&gt;  How does that work if at a later date he stops showing that faith?

If a believer stops believing, the explanation is either a) he never truly believed in the first place, and is not elect or b) he is elect and will return to belief at some point before he dies. If he doesn't, then he never truly believed to begin with, and was never elect, no matter how genuine his belief appeared to be, or how genuine he believed it to be.

I think this is correct.

So falling away at any time, regardless how long, is not indicative of un-electedness, as long as you return before you die.

Only if you have *truly* repented and *truly* understand. Per Calvinism, its possible for you to believe that you believe, but not actually believe. So that statement is true but its not much assurance. It's not works or faith but grace alone, and you cannot actually be sure. 

&gt;  I personally don't see how you can have a false sense of security in Christ?

Well frankly, I don't either, but that's wasn't meant as a commentary on Calvinism, just an observation I've made in 30 years of interacting with other Christians. Plenty of Christians walk around professing themselves confidently ""saved"" because of actions they have taken (welcoming Jesus into their hearts and saying the sinner's prayer, for example, or because of accepting the sacrament of baptism and participating in other sacraments like communion). Your citations are totally valid; I don't need to be convinced. 

&gt; Romans 3:11-12 says that there is none that doeth good, no not one and non that understandeth, there is none that seek after God. So, the Bible's testimony is that there is no way i can seek after God or much less do good unless the Father has drawn me to the Son as Jesus stated in John 6. 

I think you are interpreting this much more loosely than other Calvinists do, which is that you wouldn't be going to church and praying and doing good works if you weren't truly drawn to god because you are elect. That's certainly a valid reading of how Total Depravity works. Others, however, take a different view, and would say that those statements can be qualified by ""truly"" as in, none that ""truly"" do good (in other words, do good out of pure motivation only) or ""truly understand"" or ""truly seek after god"" and not just think they understand. 

So, sure, you could read pious behaviour as evidence of actual piety / electedness, but that's not the only way to read those verses, and promising that if you believe yourself elect, you for sure are, is not, imo, an accurate explanation of how salvation works in Calvinist theology, though its certainly where problematic beliefs have in the past arisen, like the idea that blessings in this life are indicative of electedness, something which is utterly unbiblical.

So, you had a denominational conversion and now believe yourself to be saved, and feel that I need to be, because my beliefs differ from yours? No thanks.

I'm an Episcopalian - we are called to use our intellects and reason to interpret what the errant and historically complex text we have has to say to us, personally. I, personally never at any point accepted literal bodily resurrection. The idea is repellent and grotesque to me. I read it differently from you, and I am not alone. 

I may not fall into your definition, or the standard definition, but that's actually just fine. Some Christians don't even accept the divinity of Christ or the existence of God, and are simply secular Christians. Christianity is a human religion, and all human religions are cultural constructs, which means the borders of who is ""in"" and who is not are also simply cultural constructs. 

You believe, for example, that you can and have been saved as a result of welcoming Jesus into your heart, etc. That diverges greatly from, say, a Calvinist view, in which you cannot do anything at all to ensure your salvation, you either have it or don't before you are even born, because of Unconditional Election and Limited Atonement.

That doesn't mean that there were a literal 7 days. There is no need for that at all. There is only a need for a story that simplifies for a simple, nomadic, tribal people a long, complex and intricate process of universe formation and biological evolution, making it easy for them to comprehend. The 7-day week then becomes a way to ritually embed this narrative into the lives of the people, and reinforce the notion that God is the creator of all things.

Why in the world would *that* be the part we need to take literally?

Besides, you can't have a 24 hour day if the earth is rotating at a different speed, which it was, millions of years ago when the planet was still forming. 

Indeed, you can't have a day without an earth to rotate and a sun, even if the earth isn't orbiting the sun. If we take Genesis literally, then the order of events is wrong.

And no, before you say that earth-time existed before earth, that's actually impossible. We talk about ""light years"" for a reason: time is subject to relativity. Without an object upon which gravity is acting, there is no perceptual time, and there can be no 24 hour day.

5527,"My SO is an ex-Calvinist and I asked him so that I could reply on his behalf (he doesn't come in here much).

&gt; How do Calvinists know that they are part of the Elect?

Per Calvinist systematic theology, you cannot know for sure if you are or anyone else is part of the elect. However, only people who truly believe the gospel can be elect. Belief is the only measure. Because of irresistible grace, though, its not actually up to you whether you believe or not, so truly believing can't earn you a place, your place is yours or not long before you come to believe, but if you are part of the elect, then you will come to believe at some point in your life.

What this amounts to in the lived experience is second-guessing how much you really do believe, since that's basically the only measure by which you might have a clue that you are elect. Indeed, many people who attend services (Calvinist or otherwise) and claim to be true believers will, per Calvinism, only *think* they believe, but not *truly* believe, they just don't know it. 


Its a bit convoluted.


The narrative of an exit from Calvinism is interesting, too. He has stopped believing, which means that, per their theology, he either a) never truly believed in the first place, or b) is one of the elect and will, eventually, return to the faith later in his life (again because irresistible grace.) 

I think that part answers your question: 

&gt; If they realize they aren't, and thus, that they are hell-bound, why do they persevere in going to church?

So even if a Calvinist has come to a place of complete disbelief, there is still a good reason to stay in the church, because you *might* still return to belief, if you are, in fact, one of the elect. Which you can't know. Because no one can know who is or is not elect, and no one can know whether they or anyone else's belief is true.

I hope that answers your questions. Feel free to ask anything you like, though, my SO is a fount of knowledge, having spent many years as a devoted and believing Calvinist. Even now, he'll tell you he still believes Calvinism to be the only complete and water-tight systematic theology that accounts for the whole biblical text as inerrant and internally consistent. And frankly, after reading and researching, I tend to agree, though fortunately for me I don't need the text to be inerrant or internally consistent.

5609,"Yeah, believing in gender essentialism would really make it hard to see reality in any other way. But the data doesn't bare out very well. Men make excellent stay-at-home-parents and women make excellent breadwinners. If you draw out the scores for all men and all women for most measures (height, weight, various intelligence measures, capacity to nurture, tendency toward violence/anger/fear, sexual appetite, earning potential) you end up with two bell curves that overlap for like 80+% of the population. Which means that if you picked a profile at random and looked at a handful of measures, you'd would not be able to to successfully predict that person's sex based on those scores, and the majority of people would fall in the middle and have essentially indistinguishable scores. So the dichotomy really falls apart and a spectrum emerges. I mean, even something that seems as obvious as height is really mostly a matter of perception. There is a statistically significant variation between average heights between men and women globally, but do you know what it is? Just about 1.5 inches. That's..... not a lot. 

And yet its undeniable that many couples function very well in a complementary model. I would suggest that this is the result of two things: 1) confirmation bias - we see truly complementary persons and attribute these to sex-based differences and not just personal differences, and 2) chosen roles. We take away a lot of agency from people when we tell them that their choice to sacrifice their career to stay home with kids (or to miss their children's younger years because they were working outside the home as breadwinner) was biologically predetermined and necessary, and not a noble sacrifice on their part.

5611,"&gt;  If you accept Christ, you accept the Scriptures,

Yeah, well, this never followed for me, personally, nor could I tell you that scripture is inerrant. It's written by people and edited and compiled by people, it's fair to assume that a lot is lost in translation, and a lot is added. I think of scripture as a source of possible inspiration and guidance, but it's not the end-all answer or means of knowing God. It's just a text. Reading the text, listening to others, praying and meditating, thinking for yourself using your own powers of logic and reason, and following your own conscience are a better model. But that, of course, requires us to trust people to decide for themselves what is right and wrong based on what they believe God is telling them, and that would vastly undermine the whole organized church power structure, and we can't have that, can we? (That was intended to be deliberately snarky.) But this model of personal conscience over all else is old and was well-established, and I think we've lost a lot by treating the text as a superior source of knowledge from God than our own relationship with him. 

But I don't speak for anyone but myself. The episcopal church uses the [Anglican Catechism,](http://anglicansonline.org/basics/catechism.html#HN) which is fairly traditional, but does not speak to the nature of marriage or sex or gender roles at all. We just don't police people's private lives the way some denominations do. 

Here is one articulation from an episcopalian that I like, re scripture:

&gt; Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation. This means that God has been fully revealed in the words of the Bible. We cannot add doctrines or rules that are not supported by Scripture. However, this does not mean that the Bible is inerrant, that is, without error, needing no translation or interpretation. The Word of God speaks to each age with a different emphasis, not a different message. We are in the process of learning each day what that Word means to us in our time. All of us, using our reasoning powers to the best of our ability, are part of the journey of discerning and doing God’s will.

Notice the emphasis on ""our reasoning powers to the best of our ability."" We teach that each of us is perfectly capable of reading the scripture and reasoning out for ourselves, with our own minds and relying on our own consciences, what is right for us. 

&gt; So are you saying with this final paragraph on gendered language in marriage being a stand in that gay marriage is ok under your doctrine, or are you just making a point about male and female sameness? I do agree in the idea that God created them both equal in value, but the rest is where we may separate doctrinally.

Yeah, I'm saying that whenever you see verses like ""a man shall leave his parents and cleave to his wife,"" etc, that these are just convenient stand ins and that we needn't read too much into the gendered language and assume somehow that because this is true, that NO OTHER form of spousal relationship could ever be valid. That seems like a huge jump. Especially when we say, in the same breath or even in the same verse, that ""mankind"" refers to ""all people, not just men"" but somehow the other gendered language is specific and deterministic? I just don't accept that. 

You are doing what many people who propose retaining gender hierarchy do, which is to insert a ""value"" caveat, as though that somehow diminishes the disempowerment of a person who is subjugated. Who cares if you are ""valued"" by a third party if you don't have the same rights, responsibilities, and freedoms as others just because of something you were born with? Value is not the point. It's not about lesser worth, its about lesser power. A pedestal is no different from a cage.

Some things we have in common are that we tend to read scripture as a text from a specific historical and cultural context. Some people will say that the patriarchal alignment of Adam and Eve is cleansed and removed with the resurrection. After all, Jesus says that in him there is ""no man and no woman, no gentile and no Jew."" He appears first to women and calls on them to tell the good news before anyone else.

Some of us consider OT and NT justifications for gender hierarchy to be a rhetorical in nature, and an attempt by the human authors to codify existing cultural norms. Some of us consider Paul to be problematic and generally dispense with whole portions of his contribution. Others simply explain that specific passages are directed as specific groups and not meant as rules on the whole. Others will remind you that Paul lived in a time when women were property and couldn't have conceived of females as equals in society with men, but that doesn't mean that God couldn't have conceived of it or didn't want it to happen. 


Jesus himself says little to establish any gender hierarchy. 


But for me it comes down to Genesis: ""In his image, he created them. Male and female, he created them."" This, to me, points to the essential *sameness* of the sexes, and toward egalitarianism, and permits for gendered language in reference to marriage to just be simplified stand-ins and not rules that prohibit any other form of marriage.

5618,"I'm actually writing a short story right now from Jesus' POV which will probably offend the majority of people in here for being too light-hearted and too secular, but one of the things I've had to imagine is how painful that process was, and make it brief but blunt.

--------------------
Here's a snip-it of the story, entitled *""In Which I Actually Do Save the World:""*

---------------------
The whole ordeal, from the arrest, to the sham trial, to that walk-of-shame, is pretty much exactly as humiliating and painful as I had expected. It hurts more than I’d like to admit, how quickly my companions, my brothers, my *friends,* abandon me. That was part of the deal, but it still stings.

So there I am, hanging on the cross, in pretty much the worst pain I’ve ever personally experienced (do you have any idea how hard it is to breathe when you are being suspended by your outstretched arms? Its really an awful way to go) and I’m thinking: what if I made it up in my own mind?

I panic a little bit. When had God last spoken to me? It felt like it had been kind of a long time. I mean, I was pretty sure I could *feel* His presence with me all the time. But when had I last heard Him actually speak to me? I think back to the garden, the supper table, the walk to Jerusalem, the last several stops on our path, the desert, beyond. Really, it had been ages. There were a few times, I think. But not many since that day in the river with my cousin John, and that was three years ago.

Man, has it really been three years? Am I just an insane person, wandering around barefoot, borrowing livestock, and “faith-healing” peasants? Without a mandate from heaven, it’s all pretty sketchy. Am I about to die for nothing? Is this all in my own head? 

My head. It’s heavy. There is sweat and blood dripping down my brow and, absurdly, I’m having a really hard time ignoring how freaking itchy that feels on my face. Like, I would give anything to have someone wipe my forehead right now. How is it possible that an itch on my left temple from a glob of congealing blood is the *most* distracting thing I’m feeling right now? Given that I’ve been whipped, stabbed, and literally nailed to a cross. 

My heart is still beating. How long have I been up here? It probably hasn’t been that long. The crowd has thinned significantly. The two men on either side of me - petty criminals - appear to be much worse off than I, they’ve probably been here a day, maybe.

Because of course, those won't always be decisions about abstract things. Those will be decisions like: whether to have another baby, whether to finish college or drop out to care for a family member, whether to work or stay home with children, whether to go on birth control and what kind, how/what to teach your children about gender roles and sexuality, how money is spent in the home, what kind of medical care to choose for yourself or you child, how to interpret scripture, what to believe about God, and on and on. These are decisions that an adult woman should be free to make on her own or in consultation with a partner, as an equal. To remove those responsibilities from her and instruct her to submit to her husband's will is to infantilize her and to disempower her.

This occurs when the fetus begins to move and the mother feels it, sometime around 5 months. Before that moment, the pregnancy was not considered to be alive in any meaningful sense.

 Viability is not far off from there, and is certainly much closer and much more similar in nature to the quickening cut off than the absurd notion that a fertilized ovum is ensouled. After all, 75% of fertilized eggs never implant, and 50% of implanted eggs spontaneously abort. That's a lot of souls lost, and seems like a really inefficient model. 

For me, viability is about liklihood to survive, not the mere possibility that we might be able to prolong it's suffering. I'm not interested, for the sake of this thread, to debate the problematic line for that.

Even measures as obvious as height are not especially large distinctions. There is a statistically significant difference in the mean height for males and females, but it's only about 1.5 inches. 

So the myth of the gender binary on most things rather undermines this model of complementarianism for me.

5701,"I profoundly disagree. 

Humour is an effective way to communicate with people, to help them let down their guard, and be open to your message. Serious discussion is best and most effectively initiated by lightening the mood and opening the mind and heart through shared laughter. It facilitates intimacy by acting as a pressure valve that relieves some discomfort, allowing people to delve to deeper and more open and honest places within their own psyche's, and to share those with others.

Humour also facilitates empathy, making is easy and pleasurable to relate to others and imagine yourself in someone elses shoes. Its much easier to empathize with the plight of someone if you can imagine being in their position, and one excellent way to facilitate that is through humourous narrative. Its an excellent way to create cohesion in a group and between disparate groups.

Humour also results in laughter, one of the purest expressions of joy that humans (and few other species) are capable of. Laughter actually adds years to your life, improves feelings of intimacy and generosity of spirit between people, bonds people through the intensity of pleasurable joy. Some people even errupt into laughter (or just contagious giggling) when experiencing sexual pleasure, or orgasm, because it's so joyful. 

Nor is the creation or study of humour a waste of time. Humour is ubiquitous to humans, and yet varies so dramatically between different cultures and across different languages, that some people spend their lives seriously studying humourous art forms of other cultures and traditions. Its a serious and challenging academic endeavour to try to understand and explain humour from different periods or different places, and make them accessible to a broader audience.

Humour is also an excellent teaching tool for languages - little children in particular love humour in the form of knock knock jokes and other simple puns because it teaches concepts like homonyms and homophones, rhyme, meter, and metaphor. 


---------------------------

I found this claim of yours quite weak:

&gt; child molesters, rap-ists, murderers, liars, and godless people are never in scarcity of humor, regardless of any other qualities they are deprived of

Can you point to any study demonstrating this? Because typically, persons who engage in antisocial behaviours like violent crimes actually have quite a hard time relating to others, and are often perceived as humourless, serious loners. I'd be interested to see studies contradicting this. Of course, the exception is the sociopath, but the sociopath doesn't actually experience humour at all, they just are skilled at eliciting laughter from others because they are manipulative. 

Regardless, this is a deeply flawed argument. All of those groups of people all probably also ate pasta, watched cartoons, and drove cars - those things are utterly unrelated to any crimes they commit later in life. You've posited co-occuring traits with out demonstrating that they co-occur, and then extrapolated a causal relationship out of nothing. 

------------

Ultimately, I think I understand where you are coming from, but I think you are casting too wide a net. It's not humour, that is so offensive, but cruelty and frivolousness, perhaps? You seem to be speaking from a very sincere place, and I want to reach out to you in love and tell you that cruelty, ridicule, and the debasement of genuine self-expressions of others is indeed wrong. If anyone has mistreated you for being a serious and solemn person, that is unkind of them.

It falls apart pretty quickly anyway, when you start to look at how the Good Book is compiled and edited. Religions are cultural constructs, and the Bible is a text written by people. It may be divinely inspired, but it's not the literal and unchanging truth.  So when you say ""salad bar spirituality,"" I would tell you that every single Christian is doing exactly that, just for different reasons and with different interpretations. The text is too self-contradictory to possibly guarantee a single all encompassing reading, unless its a Calvinist one, and that's pretty awful. We are all just finding that which makes it work best for us and brings us closer to our conception of divinity, and that varies drastically from person to person. So when someone says they accept the resurrection model, but believe that Genesis is a metaphor, they are making a choice about what to take literally and what to take metaphorically. Even people who claim to believe the whole thing as literal truth will turn verses upside down to declare themselves righteous for picketing funerals with messages of hate, they are doing the same thing.

&gt; How can you be sure, out of the countless religions including the different forms of christianity, you have choosen right? 

I can't be. In fact, I don't think there is a ""right"" religion at all. I'm an anthropologist, and religions are cultural constructs. They serve important social functions, like marking transition periods in your life (baby blessing, joining the community as an adult, marriage, death). They can unify groups of people during times of suffering and can redistribute wealth to the poorest members as a sort of safety net. It's a good system, sometimes. But only when it works.

&gt; And do you think, to those who it applies to, your upbringing and/or demographic has had influence on this choice?

This is absolutely the case. I grew up a wasp, and I practice a wasp-y religion: anglicanism.

&gt; Have you given any effort into looking at other religions and their teaching to confirm your choice? Why or why not?

Sure, I have lived overseas and have many friends who practice wildly divergent faiths, and many atheist or agnostic friends. I don't think anyone is right or wrong though, as long as their choice is resulting in net good in their lives. I myself am a secular episcopalian, and I continue to practice regardless of a lack of metaphysical belief because I don't think the potential benefits derived are any different for me than for a true-believer.

&gt; Have you had moments where you question your choice? If so why or what settled these doubts?

I've considered the UUs and the Quakers but honestly I enjoy the Episcopal liturgy and social activism too much to let it go.

&gt; And do you find everything in your religion agreeable, including certain events/passages in the bible? Why or why not?

I assume you an disagreeable. Yeah, loads, but much of that is due to interpretation. I mean, we're working with a text that was written over a few thousand years, and compiled a long time ago, and which is a remarkable cultural artifact. I don't, and didn't even as a believer, subscribe to the idea that unchanging truth is embedded in the text, but rather that we are empowered to draw meaning from it to inform our present reality, as the occasion calls for it. Episcopalians are not literalists. We read it as a text, as metaphorical, allegorical, etc. Last sunday our new reverend connected the reading (Jesus on his way to heal someone, a woman touches his cloak and is healed, and he feels the power go out of him, and turns to ask who it was, blesses her, and then goes on) to the concept of Privilege and our responsibility to know when power is flowing from that privilege, and to use it responsibly work toward great justice for all. And so we celebrated the Supreme Court victory for marriage equality and then turned our eyes forward to more work that needs to be done. 

And that's why I'm still practicing - because when I go to church, I am inspired to live with integrity, to choose love, and seek justice for the oppressed.",2015-07-03 14:13:22+00:00,csr03ka,3.0,t1_csqzmc7,1108.0,Christianity

BUT - permitting sequential marriage licenses is not conducive to equity within a relationship or within society. Permitting a single person to be married to multiple people sequentially in separate contracts is NOT the way to legalize group marriage.

In order to plural/group marriage to work legally, it would need to be a contract entered into by all members at the same time. It would be reasonable for that marriage to remain in effect even if someone were to leave (ie if Jack, Jill, and John are all married and Jill bails, Jack and John are still married). But if a new person is to enter the marriage, it would need to void all previous contracts and replace them with a new contract between all members. And this would be in direct contradiction to the FLDS model for plural marriage.

But this is the only way. Otherwise, the potential for abuse and the inevitable hierarchy of polygyny will undermine equality, and I sincerely hope that holding sequential marriage contracts by a central marital authority (ie - bigamy) is not legalized.",2015-07-02 17:36:34+00:00,csq2i01,1.0,t3_3bvpwg,8195.0,exmormon

&gt; a belief (or disbelief) that is held primarily because it is the belief of one's parents doesn't truly count.

An awful lot of adults fall into this category too, though. That discounts most people, I think. Few people ever critically examine their beliefs and presuppositions. But they still act in the world according to those beliefs, and that makes them real to me. If you believe gays should be stoned to death just because that's what everyone else believes, and you then stone a gay person to death, your beliefs are still to blame, whether you've ever critically evaluated them or not.

Which is at issue here - this kid may just be parroting his parents beliefs, but so what? If he was a little Jewish kid or a Christian kid or a Muslim kid and was being persecuted for it, we would consider that persecution and we would not tell the parents that they are wrong for raising their children a certain way. Whether or not the label is one he would choose for himself, he is actively being persecuted for falling into that belief category, and that persecution is real. 

In other words - he's being persecuted for being an atheist regardless of whether he is one or not. And it's the persecution that is wrong.

Example: I read my daughter the Noah's ark story the other day. She loved it - so many animals! She named them all - weird ones I don't even know, like spoonbills and the tasmanian wolf. 

Then we talked about whether we think that story is a true story, or a fable. She said, it could be true because it does flood sometimes. But she concluded that it probably wasn't true, because ""how would you know how to build a boat like that if you lived in a desert? and why would the animals not hunt each other? these animals are not behaving like wild animals. And how would they know how to get there? and how could the kangaroos swim across the ocean? why would they listen to those humans? They would probably either attack or run away, because that's what animals do,"" and like 17 other good reasons to suspect that this probably isn't a true story. 

Then I asked her why people tell the story if it isn't true, and she suggested that is was fun and interesting, and it makes people who believe in God think that God can be forgiving, though she also said she didn't really think this was a good example of that because he did kill a whole lot of people, which wasn't very forgiving. I suggested it might have more to do with his promise not to flood the world again but she said ""No. Because it still floods."" Lol.

This isn't Kierkegaard here. This is just simple critical thinking, and even a 7 yo can do it. Nor am I indoctrinating her, I'm just asking questions and letting her think it through. She believes in Santa Claus, for example, because she actually has proof for him (reindeer droppings, presents, letters, someone ate the cookie and drank the milk, etc).

So my daughter is indeed from previous relationship. She very much likes my bf, thinks he would make a good parent, feels he is fair and kind and patient, and that he loves me, which makes her feel secure. She also desperately wants a brother or sister, or two, or more (!) and insists that she will help out and will be a great older sister. She also has a half-sister already, so the idea that her future siblings would be half-siblings is neither foreign nor worrisome for her.

As for the way he thinks of her - he's not currently her parent, but the family merger (haha I know that's so unromantic but that's what a marriage truly is) we have on the table would include him legally adopting her. This is both because we want her to be his child, and because I want to sever her bio-dad's parental rights in case something happens to me.

My bf reinforced kind of unintentionally that he is 100% on board with this the other day, when we were talking about what could happen if we got pregnant and my life was in danger. I was like, ""Just to be sure, in case I haven't been clear: save me. We can make more babies, but there is only one of me and I have more work to do."" And he fervently agreed, saying, ""oh, absolutely. I don't want to be alone in the world with [daughter] and a newborn to care for, without you!"" So he's really imagining that she would be his responsibility; that was a given, in that scenario.

Idk if that would change if there was a fully bio-child in the picture, though. I also don't know what would happen if it came to making choices that would preference one child over the other (ie - do we spend this money on a car for our older child or on summer camp for the little one?). But arguably, that would be a debate no matter the bio-origin of the children, when you have a large age-gap. Besides, he wants babies, but he hasn't said they have to be his babies. In other words, if we couldn't have bio-kids, we could try surrogacy or adoption. But he wants to experience raising children from infancy, not just from elementary age.

Since posting this, I've actually spent a few weeks living at his place since he is driving my kid to and from computer camp each day at the university where he works. They get along quite well, and I also feel like *I'm* a better parent and person around him. I think..... we could maybe manage it.

5891,"&gt; In my book, pregnancy is defined by the presence of a diploid zygote in the uterus. 

Well, OK, but that's really just you, then. That's not the standard definition for anyone else, to my knowledge. I'm certainly not making anything up here, I'm just going with the medical definition, derived from studying the human body. Pregnancy refers to a physical, parasitic relationship between two organisms *and* a biological process, and without implantation there is no relationship and there is no beginning of the process. Without implantation, it just passes through the vagina in normal vaginal secretions like 75% of all fertilized eggs. 

&gt; If you take a pill that causes a fertilized egg to die, that is an abortion-inducing pill.

Why do you need that to be ""abortion inducing""? Why can't it just be ethically wrong for you without redefining pregnancy and abortion? You're entitled to your definition, but it has no bearing on the medical definition of pregnancy or abortion, and we're talking about a legal case, in which using the medical definitions really matters. 

There is no scriptural justification for your view. If anything, the people who wrote the Bible would have believed very different things about what constitutes pregnancy, and when the fetus is alive. Your view is all based on our scientific understanding of a zygote, only you are redefining ""pregnancy"" to no longer be in reference to a relationship between two organisms.

Again, I'm not saying *anything* here to refute any claims that that fertilized egg is a life (regardless of my views), I'm just saying, if you have a problem with this form of preventing pregnancy, then find a more accurate way to explain it.

An abortifacient causes a fertilized egg that has been implanted in the uterine lining (a pregnancy) to be expelled when the uterus sheds said lining, the way it does with every period.

5917,"&gt; Church founded by His Son

There was a pretty long delay between his death and the establishment of the Church. All I'm suggesting is that humans are fallible and it's possible that, while they all did the best they could, they are still just people. Jesus didn't exactly leave a lot of instructions behind when he died. The church today looks absolutely nothing at all like anything he did in his life. Even the whole Eucharist piece has become a whole ritualistic re-enactment of his death and resurrection when the verse in question could easily be interpreted to mean: ""reflect on your gratitude at meal times by saying grace.""

Those rituals are meaningful to us today because we have assigned meaning to them, but they would be oblique and recognizable to any person who ever actually met Jesus. That's because, even if Jesus was God, the church that has arison to worship the biblical God is a man-made construct. The robes, the buildings, the songs, the prayers, the ritual Eucharist, the teachings - they are all inventions based on humans interpreting a text that was also written by humans in an attempt to document this experience they heard other people talk about - which was witnessing the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth. Even if you take the NT to be the Word of God, a lot of what the Roman Catholic church invented is completely unrelated to anything in the Bible. 

I think people are just really uncomfortable with the uncertainty that comes with understanding that religions, all religions, as social and cultural constructs. ",2015-06-29 15:42:03+00:00,csmgo22,18.0,t1_csmffl0,2126.0,Christianity

He had also only ever slept with his previous fiance, and waited until marriage with his wife, so he had a lot of sexual baggage *and* years and years and years of sexual repression. I agree, though, that a few positive experiences would do it but I can probably count on my hand the number of times he's ask for sex and it's always when we're already talking about it or I've made clear ahead of time that I want to. Which I suppose I should have done last night, but I didnt, so he just switched off and that was it for the rest of the evening.

The turning me down might be more about asserting himself than anything else, which is why I'm trying to be ok with it. Cognitively I comprehend that it's not the end of the world, I'm just really, really bad at processing the feelings that come with it, and I end up just spiraling into sorrow and pain over what many people deal with all the time. Which is one reason I didn't know if I could come here to talk about it. But you know, I have an unhealthy relationship to sex and particularly to my partners desire for me, and really hang a lot of my self-worth on that. 

I moped about all day because I couldn't snap out of it. I started panicking that my (admittedly problematic) relationship to alcohol is sabatoguing my last chance at happiness. I questioned my purpose on the planet. I nearly rescheduled my GRE session because I despaired being able to concentrate on studying. In other words, I blew it all up into something huge.


He's going to be home soon. We talked throughout the day some, but not like normal. He's with his bf right now (no, he's not secretly gay - as I understand it the bf gets less than a quarter of the sex that I get, even if you adjust for opportunity, theirs is an emotional but not particularly sexually intimate relationship). Idk what is going to happen but I'm going to try to just be nice. He knows I'm still upset and hopefully knows why, but maybe not, idk. It's possible he thinks I'm not that petty and immature and might actually have some reason for being sad and closed off all day. Or he doesn't notice or care and just wants to move on and not talk about it.

5982,"Its interesting that you include cousins though, since that's an extremely recent prohibition in human history. Like, only in the last century really, and it's still perfectly permissible in much of the world. Paternal or maternal cross-cousin marriage is a very well established and nearly universal marriage and kinship pattern. 

For parents/grandparents and offspring you can make a strong case for uneven distribution of power / abuse of power in the relationship, potential coercion, and potential psychological issues *if* they were part of the same household. You can also make a good case for genetic risks.

With regard to siblings - you would have fewer genetic risks and less power imbalance, so I have a hard time making a strong case against this from a public health stand point. Also genetic risks are only relevant if the pair can and plans to procreate.

Aunt/Uncles and their Nieces/Nephews is a kindship pattern that's pretty well known in many places and was practices in parts of Christendom at various times. There are relatively few genetic risks, and if the two persons are close in age (which is often the case in large families) then their is less likely to be a power imbalance. So again, i have trouble making a strong case against it on this basis. Again, genetic risks are only relevant if the pair can and plans to procreate.

Of course, if you base your ideas of what is and isn't permissible solely on a single text, the Bible, then I'm sure you have other opinions on the matter. My point is only that its hard to make a rational case against these, but I'd be interested to see someone try.

6057,"I'm sorry for the situation you are in, and I'm sorry for what happened to you.

My suggestion to you is to tell her, very simply, that you like her, but you're a little shy when it comes to making the first move. You can explain that you are worried you'll come on too strong, or that you aren't sure how she feels about it, or something to redirect the focus and make it about accommodating her, and not you. Just let her know that you really like her, but you don't want to make a move until she does because you want to be sure she's into it too. That's not a lie, I don't think, it's just not the whole truth. I think that's ok, and it leaves the door open for you to share more later. She clearly already likes you or she wouldn't be hanging out with you. For many people, hearing someone is shy but eager is all it takes for them to take the reigns. No one wants to take the risk and feel rejected. If you can be brave and tell her you like her and are attracted to her, maybe she will be brave enough to just kiss you and get things going.

In the long run, I do think you should share your background with you intimate partner. But this might not be the girl. Who knows? I tell all of my bfs and lovers about my assault because I need them to know never to do certain things (like, wake me up for sex without being 100% sure I'm actually awake and consenting). When you are ready, you'll know.

But for this girl, for this instance, just try to be as honest as you can and still feel comfortable. I know I personally would feel very close to someone if they disclosed that they liked me but were shy about making a move. A little emotional vulnerability is how we build emotional intimacy with our friends, family, and partners. And for many people, that kind of emotional intimacy is extremely important groundwork for physical intimacy. In my experience, it makes physical intimacy much more intense and rewarding.

I've explained to her that many people like to think about their loved ones living on in a happy place like heaven, and that sometimes it's really nice to imagine that, but that chances are it's probably not true. But that doesn't mean we can think about it that way to make feel a little better when we are really sad. I've chosen this approach because it think it's important to acknowledge the real emotional and psychological benefits to believers of believing comforting things, and to point out to her how those beliefs seem to be invented solely for the good feelings they elicit, because understanding that help you to be both compassionate toward believers and skeptical of any belief you yourself might be holding on to just because you like how it makes you feel.

She could have chosen psychoanalytics, she could have chosen post-colonialism, but she chose a feminist critical approach because that is the project she has undertaken. She is selecting examples rhetorically to demonstrate the case she is making, formulating an argument based on textual evidence to support a thesis that is relevent to her critical approach. This is what graduate (and honestly, most decent undergraduate) students everywhere do when they do a close reading of one or more texts as part of a work of academic criticism. That's what's she is doing. It's baffling to me that this project is oblique to some people, but if you have never taken a graduate class in critical theoretical approaches to text, then I suppose how would you know? But for those of us who have, *we* know she isn't condemning the games she chooses to explore, and she reiterates that herself. *We* don't interpret her words to mean those games are ""bad"" or thst people who like them are ""bad,"" any more than we think Goeffrey Chaucer, or Raymond Chandler, or Charlotte Brontë, or Edgar Allen Poe, or Alan Ginsburg, or Robert Browning, or C.S. Lewis are bad. Of course those authors, their texts, and their readers are not bad, just because we can explore ideas like social inequity, problematic representations of gender and gender roles, psychological repression, violence, or sexuality, or racism. The text is *more* interesting because there is much there to unpack. This is about Criticism, with a capital C.

Make a plan and after 6 months, either move in somewhere together or just move  in with his parents and continue to live rent free while you go to school.

But ""should"" isn't really the only question - because none of this can happen without funding. 

The question is, will the tax-payer agree to fund the expense and put their money where their mouth is? I think not. In the same way that they do not fund childcare for working mothers, universal public preschool, or even just the cost of hospital care and delivery. They don't fund education and prevention programs that prevent unplanned pregnancies and reduce abortions and STI rates. They don't fund better adoption and foster care systems, they don't pay for clean, safe facilities, and they don't pay for excellent, highly trained employees. They withdraw needed food and medical aide from the indigent and those below the poverty level, calling them ""welfare queens"" and don't fund women's or children's (or God forbid, men's) shelters, while major corporations set up in tax ""shelters.""  The moment that unplanned, unwanted child is born he is forsaken by the system that created barriers to his mother making a different reproductive choice. The opponents of choice generally stand on a platform that is anti-family in every way. They want to restrict family planning, restrict what loving couples can wed or adopt, over-tax the poor and middle class at the expense of the rich, fail to fully educate teenagers about their bodies and how to safely engage in an adult world, and utterly abandon living children to a life of poverty and abuse. That is not a pro-life stance. ",2015-06-22 18:57:13+00:00,csf1kvy,14.0,t1_csf0nzi,1400.0,Christianity
6151,"1) Yes an no. I still probably wouldn't personally have any problem with abortion, but I would still support funding transferring any unwanted pregnancies to those ex-utero incubators if the tax-payer really believes that that is the most ethical way to handle unwanted pregnancy. Sure. I think that would be great - think how much we could learn about pregnancy and developmental embryology from the process of developing those incubators! It would be a great feat of bio-engineering such as we have rarely even conceived. I imagine, however, that it would take a really long time for those to be widely available, so in the interim, women should still have access to abortion. The mere fact that we are capable at huge expense and only for a few at a time, to keep them alive and gestate them, wouldn't change the ethical implications of abortion for me.

2) No. I'm talking about newborns with impairments that will prevent them from maturing beyond the level of a new born, or which will be painful and ultimately fatal in a few months to a few years. Such a newborn, who will spend its life in suffering, or require many painful surgeries (typically performed without anesthesia for one so young) just to be viable enough to survive for a few months, is worthy of the compassion to let them die without our meddling intervention. I do not profess to have a clear line for delineating who does or does not fit into this category. Nor do I consider that utilitarian, I consider it compassionate. Its not about the loss of one person for the good of everyone else, its about allowing nature to take its course when doing otherwise would only prolong suffering, for the good of that person specifically.",2015-06-22 18:12:08+00:00,cseztv5,12.0,t1_csez9wg,888.0,Christianity

6155,"For me, it isn't a life worthy of rights that impede upon another person's rights until it can survive outside of the host. And we can pat ourselves on the back for having pushed back the line of viability a little bit, but we haven't actually pushed it back much at all. There is a pretty firm biological cut-off after which our medical technology is just woefully inadequate by comparison to nature, and we cannot possibly hope to do more than prolong suffering, which I believe to be wrong. Its the same reason why I support withholding life-preserving care at birth in cases of extreme/terminal disability, and I support physician assisted suicide for the elderly and terminal. 

What's always surprising to me is how many Christians disagree with those views. I didn't grow up in the US, and I'm consistently surprised by the people I meet while living here as an adult. I honestly had only ever met maybe 2 or 3 people in my entire life who were opposed to abortion on religious grounds. One was a devout buddhist who believed the souls in question would have to go back an wait in line again, which, honestly, made no sense to me because in that case, there is no real death, just a minor inconvenience. With regard to the ""souls"" of aborted fetuses, if they have a soul doesn't it just go to heaven? I mean, we aren't labouring under the delusion that it needs to be baptised, right? So there still isn't any spiritual death. Bodily life isn't the only kind of life, and certainly isn't the most important, if you buy the Christian narrative. I just don't get it.

Therefore, any religious objection to a change in secular laws is utterly moot. When they immediately start claiming that pastors will be forced to perform same-sex marriages tell them this cannot happen as long as they are acting as a religious leader in a registered house of worship. (If they work at a for-profit wedding chapel that is not registered as a house of worship, then they are still subject to the same laws as everyone else, including bakers). Of course, the best solution for this is for religious leaders to perform religious wedding ceremonies only, and for that to count as a legal wedding, everyone, no matter who they are, has to go down to the court house and sign papers for the state to recognize it. In other words, its already problematic that church leaders are acting as agents of the state when the perform weddings and subsequently sign marriage licenses.

6184,"&gt; Christianity has traditionally strived to come up with a concept of God that reflects the true reality of God, based on His Creation and revelations, and then derive morality from a teleological perspective of the Universe informed by such concepts of God

But...... his ""revelations"" are recorded by men. You're telling me the central text of Christianity is not a product of the cultural and historical context of the people who wrote it? Not a rhetorical attempt to canonize and legitimize and existing system of patriarchal and priesthood authority, right down to rules like how to sacrifice a dove? That the genesis story is not a creation myth like every other creation myth in the world?

No. All religions are man-made attempts to describe and explain the divine, and facilitate growing closer to said divinity. No earthly text or human prophet can truly accurately depict a God who is unknowable and exists outside of our capacity for understanding.

Regardless, I reject your claim that my views are not based on my understanding of a Christian God. Jesus of Nazareth is mute on abortion, but he is a supporter of women's rights, and treats women as equal persons, which was radical then and is still radical today. 

Besides, even the OT case against abortion is just a matter of interpretation. Jeremiah was apparently known to God before he was knit together - but that's a reference to a specific person. The closest we get to anything remotely relevant is the quickening moment in Luke [Luke 1:39-41]. Historically, for the entire history of the church and for thousands of years before, the moment when a pregnancy was considered to be ""alive"" in any meaningful sense was when it started kicking and the pregnant woman feels it. So regardless completely aside from other abortion issues, there is no history of thinking about a zygote as alive or a person, and there is a history of considering a cut-off period within the duration of the pregnancy. Several passages also remark that an ""untimely birth"" (miscarriage/abortion) would be better than a life of misery. And let's not forget that this is the same text that condemns the first-borns of all of Egypt to death. 

So pretending like we aren't all picking and choosing and attempting to make a very contradictory text that doesn't directly address this issue fit our own view of God as we understand him/her is fallacious. ",2015-06-22 14:09:02+00:00,cser8bh,17.0,t1_csepbf7,4427.0,Christianity

Her personhood matters more to me, even if it's at the cost of this other entity. Her right to choose whether she wants to stay pregnant or not is way, way more important that preserving a zygote. She can get pregnant again. Other people will too. The begining of pregnancy is not a rare or magical occurance worthy of so much reverence, it's just a biological function, and most abortion is just a medically induced miscarriage. More zygotes will generate. 75% of all conceptions never implant and only 50% of those that do survive the early weeks. A zygotes future trajectory is anything but certain.

Because data cannot contradict a theory - that's a vast oversimplification of the relationship between a scientific theory and data. Data, once confirmed, can compel the re-evaluation of a theory, but it still wouldn't overturn it until a new theory can be presented which better accounts not just for those data, but for all the other data and resulting conclusions. Its about *overwhelming* evidence, not about unique findings.

Your quote is of limited utility here and poorly worded to begin. That is about the relationship between a hypothesis (which is an educated guess based on prior knowledge) and the *results* of an experiment. A theory is not a guess. A theory is an attempt to explain a large number of different but related phenomena observed and documented by a large number of experiments by many scientists over a large period of time, and to consolidate this knowledge by presenting a unifying theory that both explains all of those disparate results and accurately predicts results of future experiments, which process is involved in vetting a theory.

We might be at an impasse, and its crushing me. 

To compound the issue, we are trying to decide on moving in together (when, and where). As it is, he lives somewhere he's happy and wants to stay another year, and I live in another part of the city (really, another city in a sprawling metroplex) and I can't leave for another year because my kid is enrolled at a school we love for the coming year. We will probably have to wait a year regardless, but even then we don't know yet where we will move. 

We both want things for our lives, and some of them overlap, but not all. But we're, like, frighteningly perfect for each other. Under normal circumstances we would probably be more compromising, BUT I should mention that we are both divorced (him very recently, less than a year ago) and are both really vigilant about wanting to not sacrifice more than we are willing to, to avoid future resentment, while at the same time being very seriously involved very quickly.

And that contextualizes how I feel about kids. I never wanted any, I had an unplanned one, I regret not having an abortion, even though I love my kid and obviously I don't resent her for her existence and I'm doing everything I can to be a good parent to her. I like the idea of having more, sometimes, but it's sooooo hard. Of course, it might not be so hard if we had stable incomes, family support, partner support - things I didn't have last time.

Its.... hard. But it's not like I can just decide later.

6367,"Intravenous drug use is no small thing. Your first move should be to **go get tested for blood born diseases like HIV and Hep C**, because if you've been having sex with him and he's been using (and chances are, he was using long before you noticed symptoms of it) then you are at significant risk for adverse health consequences. You should also stop having sex with him unprotected, and actually stop kissing him - Hep C spreads through saliva and tears, its highly contagious. Until he has been tested and is off of intravenous drugs, you are risking your life by continuing to be intimate with him.


Once you have taken care of your own most pressing concerns, consider your next steps. 

* Does he have any family or supportive friends you could call on to help during recovery?

* Does he have insurance that would cover some in-patient or intensive out-patient care for him? Or is there money in the family that could help pay for treatment?

* Find some local AA or NA groups and print out a list of meeting times. Focus on AA. They are alcoholics, but you will find more long-term sobriety there, in my experience. NA is really hit or miss. Ideally he should attend both throughout the week.

* Find him a medical clinic somewhere where he can go to get tested as well

* Find yourself an al-anon group and/or a private therapist to help you through it.

* Finally, when you've got some resources put together, prepare your approach. You have some options, (approach him in private, in public, with a group of friends, or move out while he's gone and leave him his resources and tell him to call you when he's sober), but whatever you do, prepare for him to be angry, to deny, to minimize, to obfuscate, and to remain obstinately unwilling to reform. 

* Do plan to have another place to stay. Living with an addict who has no intention of getting better is crazy-making. Don't do it to yourself, and don't leave any of your valuables at home that your don't want pawned. But if you are willing, staying with him while he tries to get better (if he does try) can be very helpful for him.

* Prepare for emotional abuse, manipulation, lots and lots of lying, self-justifications, and delusion.

However, specific instances may still be more than coincidental: they may be a result of the Placebo Effect.

That is the mechanism by which people are ""faith-healed:"" faith.

I'm saying that the woman and the drunk driver have the same legal standing in terms of their obligation to sacrifice part of their bodies to anyone who might be affected as a result of their risk-taking behavior. To oblige one differently than the other is unjust. The point of this analogy is to construct the pregnant woman and no different than any other person, and the relationship between the pregnant woman and the fetus no different from the relationship between two strangers.

Obviously the easy response is to say, well, that person wouldn't exist if her birth control hadn't failed. But its not the existence of the pregnancy that is the problem for the pregnant mother, either. Its existence does not affect her, only its dependence upon her body. As you say, if it would be removed and survive in a vat, then there would be no issue. But it is dependent on her voluntary donation of bodily resources, and she has the right to withdraw those in the same way that the drunk driver has a right to refuse to donate a kidney to the victim of his crash, even if the victim needs it to live and will die without it, and wouldn't be in that dependent position were it not for the drunk driver's actions.

So in terms of her state of mind while engaging in sexual activity, it's absolutely no different from the drunk driver.

Since the bible is mute on the subject, it makes sense that doctors and midwives would come up with their own interpretations in an attempt to match the biological reality with their belief in a soul.

6447,"A Point-By-Point Refutation
-----------------------

&gt; She is not fit, strong, and healthy. 

I wasn't aware that was a requirement for womanhood. But its certainly a symptom of income inequality and poor availability of healthcare, long working hours, and limited child care options.

&gt; She is not beautiful. 

If that's not a patriarchal standard for womanhood I don't know what is.

&gt; She is not loyal. 

To whom? She may be fiercely loyal to her family and friends. 

&gt; She does not uplift the spirits of those around her. 

Get back on that pedestal, damnit!

&gt; She has no useful productive skills, other than ""getting paid for doing something or other in an office"". 

So she works, in an office. That's sounds like a job, to me. But maybe you've never had a white-collar job so what would you know about it?

&gt; She can't cook. She can't manage a household. 

Can you? Also, btw, a glaring symptom of income inequality, and lack of resources. People who ""manage a household"" effectively typically don't have to work in order to do so, or if they do, are able to afford to pay for supplementary services (cleaning service, dry-cleaning, lawn-care, pool-care, babysitting, nannies). 

&gt; She waits until the least healthy possible time to have children. 

Define healthy? The healthiest time biologically is the least healthy time financially. 

&gt; When they are born, she feeds them from a plastic bottle instead of her breast. 

Because she has to work, in that office you mentioned, to make money to buy food and diapers. Also, breast milk might not be an option for her because she's on medication, or because she's simply unable to nurse. Historically, breastfeeding was considered a peasant labour, not something the lily-white women on pedestals did. Wealthy women never breastfed, and would outsource to a wet-nurse, would that suit you more? 

&gt; If they are male, she has a piece of their cock sliced off with no anesthesia, instead of fighting to protect them like any decent mother would. 

This is only true for 50% of infant boys in the US today, and that number is dropping precipitously. Also, in my experience, men and male-dominated institutions like the CDC and AAP are the biggest proponents of this practice.

&gt; When they are older, she feeds them food made in a factory and packaged in bags and boxes, instead of fresh vegetables, fruit, meat, and cheese. She gives them carbonated sugar water to drink, and ""treats"" made from corn syrup. 

This is another commentary on poverty, not on women. Healthy food is more expensive, and if you live in a food dessert, you might actually be unable to get fresh foods where you live even if you could afford it. This is a function of income inequality and the associated lack of basic skills like cooking fresh food. 

&gt; Instead of devoting her time to loving them, she puts them in the care of a stranger so she can go back to doing things in an office. 

Because she has to work. How else can they live, or eat? Who is going to pay the rent? Besides, you can talk about ""loving them"" all you want, but it's pretty freaking hard to like people you spend all goddamn day cleaning up after. Daycare can be a really good thing. Only someone who has never had kids would judge someone for not wanting to stay home 24/7 taking care of them. Besides, those ""things in an office"" you keep referring to, that's her career. 

&gt; When they are older, she sends them to public school where they learn to be good, obedient, factory workers and buyers of consumer junk, rather than strong, independent, self-reliant adults. 

So.... are you going to provide the $10k - $25k per year per child to send them to private school? 

&gt; Odds are good she deprives them of their father, if they ever had a chance to know their father at all.

Yes, absent fathers are never to blame for failing to show up to birthdays, remembering to call on Christmas, or making any financial contributions to their children's upkeep. Nope. Also - the absurd presumption that any father is better than no father. This is demonstrably untrue. A child is better off with parents and caregivers who are responsible, invested, and available.

6450,"I really like this approach, actually. But most people would say that the woman is morally obliged to accept the ""inconvenience"" of pregnancy to preserve that persons life. A sort of moral obligation to do everything in your power to save someone if you can (same rule that requires you to stop if you witness an accident). BUT of course, you are under zero obligation to donate blood or organs or any bodily function, and that's where this argument breaks down for me. A woman is not a vessel. A woman is not an incubator. And pregnancy isn't an inconvenience, its dangerous every single time. So I would say, asking a woman to carry a pregnancy to term is tantamount to requiring live blood and organ donations from people to keep complete strangers alive. Most people would agree that that violates their own right to bodily integrity. But they usually fail to make the connection to how a forced pregnancy is a violation of a woman's right to bodily autonomy.

You may also need to stay quiet about your plans to not have children. It sucks not to be able to be honest, but it's better than putting yourself at risk. You, like many young atheists and closeted LGBT kids, should protect yourself first and foremost.

6455,"So there are a few different theories here at play, and even among the multi-regionalists, Africa still plays an important role, since we do know, or we think we know, that recent pre-human ancestors definitely travelled out of Africa. This is the core of the Out of Africa theory of human evolution, and isn't really under debate. The question is, did the earliest modern humans originate in Africa as well (this is referred to as the [Recent African Origin of Modern Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans) theory), or did they evolve after one of those migratory periods and spread out from there to many different regions (the [Multi-Regional Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiregional_origin_of_modern_humans))? After all, we believe that another relative of ours, the Neanderthal, evolved post-migration in the Eurasia. I would refer you to the citations in that entry because I'm not in a position to do much research right at this moment. The multi-regional model posits that modern humans share an ancestor that originated in an unknown, possibly Eurasian location, following the migration of a recent pre-human ancestral population out of Africa. The best support for this is the genetic record we all carry with us, both DNA and mitchochondrial DNA.

There are also some scientists making claims for mesopotamia, though these remain unsupported by enough additional findings so far. And of course, the Chinese government continues to fund research to support an [out-of-Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Asia_theory) theory, though that isn't taken seriously in the scientific community anymore since the 1980s, as there just isn't adequate support for it. 

The point is, not all components of the Out of Africa theory are as established as many people think, at least within the field of anthropology, because it leaves a lot unexplained, and our interpretation of modern human ancestry is still hotly debated today as we try to construct a narrative that best accommodates the data that we have.
