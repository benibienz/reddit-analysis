We (F30, M28) are an open couple, and have been since we met. In practice, that has meant a few flings here and there, but for the most part we are focused on our own relationship. We're engaged and will marry next year, already have a child, will have more. All of that is still on track. 

Recently he's been seeing a new girl. In the past, he's seen girls and guys, and one of those guys became a genuine relationship, for a while. I didn't get on well with that one, but that had more to do with clashing personalities.

This new girl as expressed an interest in meeting me and our daughter and getting to know him well in the context of his family life. On the one hand, that seems relatively innocuous - I know that I feel similarly curious when I'm dating someone who has another primary. On the other hand.... well I just gained back quite a bit of weight this fall and I'm just really uncomfortable about that in general. And I'm wary about having her over to the house, but that's probably the only convenient way to manage it. 

Best case scenario, it all goes just fine. She and I hit it off, partner feels loved and supported on all sides, and we move on.

Any advice on how to remain calm, positive, welcoming, etc, would be appreciated.

This document, written in 1835, claims:


&gt;American women never manage the outward concerns of the family, or conduct a business, or take a part in political life; nor are they, on the other hand, ever compelled to perform the rough labor of the fields, or to make any of those laborious exertions which demand the exertion of physical strength. No families are so poor as to form an exception to this rule.

 That excludes all women of colour who are doing manual labour without pay under Southern slavery, and women of colour doing manual labour with poor pay and segregated living conditions in the North, and women living on any farm, or any working class woman living in a city.

But also, there is this:

&gt; The legislators of the United States, who have mitigated almost all the penalties of criminal law, still make rape a capital offence, and no crime is visited with more inexorable severity by public opinion. This may be accounted for; as the Americans can conceive nothing more precious than a woman’s honor, and nothing which ought so much to be respected as her independence, they hold that no punishment is too severe for the man who deprives her of them against her will. In France, where the same offence is visited with far milder penalties, it is frequently difficult to get a verdict from a jury against the prisoner. Is this a consequence of contempt of decency or contempt of women?

While he's home during the nights and weekends, they want him to refrain from smoking pot or drinking alcohol, of course. And I want to support him, as a problem drinker myself. But idk if I can do it. Caring for him for the last few months has resulted in an escalation of my drinking, and I've been smoking nearly everyday for the last several months. I don't know if I can quit, but I want to help him. I also need to be able to make it through the night, though, and actually get to sleep, neither of which are possible for me without help, and I'm not on ambien at the moment, so I have nothing to fall back on.

I'm worried I'm not going to be able to support him adequately, or that I'll fail and then feel like I need to lie about it to him, which we've agreed I shouldn't do.

I had a new one placed after 5 years. My bf at the time said he could sometimes feel those strings, but when I had the old one removed it was so far inside my uterus it took 40 minutes to get out and after I drove away I had a horrible panic attack (worst one of my life - my spine froze up so that I couldnt look anywhere but up. I took a muscle relaxant and slept, but it was really scary and awful.) I couldn't afford the time off or the cost for the ultrasound to check that it was correctly placed, so I never went back to check.

I've had the new one since Jan 2013. I've never had a period at all before now. But last weekend I felt like for some reason my nipples were really sensitive, and I knew that sometimes residual period symptoms appear, so I didn't worry about it. Then sunday, it got worse. I actually felt cramping. I had sex with my partner and after that felt horrible. Upset stomach, loose bowels, pain in my ovaries horrible. I actually had my bf try to feel the strings but to no avail. He's never felt them. I've never felt them with either device. My cervix points back and down weirdly, apparently, which is due to my kid and her weird delivery, I think. 

So - phantom periods.  Normal? Should I be worried? I was scared of an ectopic pregnancy on Sunday but the pain subsided, so I figure it was just a period, just without the bleeding.

And some chips. And icecream. 

It was like my brain (not my body. My body wasn't even really hungry, but my brain) wanted to sabotage me. I ate more carbs today than I have in months.

It's so hard for me because it's like I forget my goals and my reasoning, but only long enough to start eating. Then I feel bad, and I eat to make myself feel better. And then afterward I hate myself, and decide that the battle is lost for today anyway, and just relent some more. And then it's bedtime and I hate myself and I've only made it all worse. 

It makes me afraid to try, because I'm afraid the psychological backlash will drive me to actually gain weight.

I lost 15lbs earlier this year and kept it off all summer, but I'm up 5 again now, after 2 weeks of bingeing that precipitated this 6 month goal period.

I really need to make a drastic change. How do you guys handle the mind games? Do you struggle with your brain conveniently forgetting the objective, selectively caring, or throwing in the towel?

Any tips? Should I wear a bracelet and snap my wrist when I think about carbs? I live with my parents and brother m-th and my partner f-su so I can't exactly purge all of the fridges and pantries. Maybe a strict meal plan? I actually don't mind eating the same thing every day.

-------------
There is a difference between porn use, porn abuse, and porn dependence/addiction.
-------------

* If he uses it now and then to get off, regardless of how he feels about it, that's porn use. It's something he does sometimes and while it might not be the most healthy strategy for getting off, its an easy short-cut to feeling good and relieving an urge, but just like the beer or eating a second helping of ice-cream - its something he does that might not be great but is a calculated risk he is choosing to take because he's an adult and its his life. It's a temptation he gives into - maybe even daily, for the purpose of getting aroused and getting off, which many people need to do to get to bed at night or to relax after work, and he may or may not feel bad about it sometimes, but overall it's not destroying his life or really taking up much time or energy either way and he helps blow off steam and reduce stress, so on balance its at worst having a neutral effect on his health and happiness. If he really, truly needed to go without (ie - if his smart phone fell into the pool and he was at his parents house with no internet), he could manage.


* If she is using porn for a lot more than just getting off - like, browsing when she's bored or lonely, browsing at work during lunch, spending more money than she has to spare on it, and using it as a form of escape from reality when she's emotionally upset or distressed, and while she can still get off without it and seems to still want to have sex with you when things are fine, she uses it avoid having to be intimate with you when you are fighting, and its mostly just episodes of binging, or a perpetual undercurrent of usage throughout the day whenever she has down time, with spikes when she's truly stressed, depressed, hurt, etc, then she's abusing it: she's using it beyond it's intended use, to self-medicate other issues, and probably not helping to relieve those issues.

* If he's using pornography to excess - all day, basically: at home, at work, driving in the car, all the time, even if he only masturbates like once or twice the whole day - and it's now impossible for him to achieve an orgasm with a partner without porn in the back ground, and he has escalated to much more hard-core forms of porn, including ones he does not want to be using, and if his usage is causing him considerable, clinical distress, and is putting his job in jeopardy (using a work computer, for example) or his legal status in jeopardy (using illegal pornography, for example) or jeopardizing his marriage and custody of his children, and his masturbation is causing him physical injury through over use, and despite many ongoing desperate attempts to quit, using every means at his disposal, from blocking software to accountability partners to destroying his smart phone and he knows any day now everything will crash down around him, or has already begun to and he still cannot stop, then he's an addict, and he needs professional help.

Me [F/29/HL] and BF [M/26/LL]. Not a DB but showing troubling signs. Both divorced, both from previous DB relationships. He's on meds that stifle his drive.

Currently its always on me to initiate and make a point of planning time for sex. This is partly because he was so harmed by his ex constantly turning him down that he feels too unsafe to initiate. So I've started to treat sex like a reverse gate-keeping thing - we can't start the rest of the evening of getting high or watching a movie or whatever until after we have sex. 

Last night, I was turned down for sex again. This doesn't happen often, but when it does, its really, really hard for me to deal with. To compound the situation, I was high and a little drunk, so I didn't handle it well. Last time I was turned down was last weekend and I was drunk then too, and basically emotionally blackmailed my partner into having sex with me. Which I feel bad about. So I knew, when he turned me down yesterday, that I had to just accept it, because he needs to know that he has permission to say no.

I should have made it clear to him, with words, that after being apart for several days (we don't live together) finding time to be intimate was important to me and that I wanted to work it into the evening. Instead, we got high, basically hung out in our own separate worlds, and then at 1030 he decided it was too late for sex. Not too late to spend 30 minutes on bloody facebook before turning the light off, though. Just too late for the 8-12 minutes it would have taken to have sex. 

And goddamnit it's so hard for me to pull out of the emotional nose-dive of being rejected. I turned away from him, I sighed, I didn't want him to touch me, I didn't talk to him for the rest of the night except to say good night and tell him everything way fine, and I got up and left the bed before he was even asleep. I wasn't trying to me mean to him, or punish him. I was in pain. Real physical pain from the flood of negative emotions. I hate this. 

I ended up getting out of bed and staying up will 12:30 looking at porn (the first half of which is the porn he likes, so I can hate myself more for not looking like them, and the second half of which is porn I like but am really, really trying not to use, so now I hate myself even more.)

I shouldn't be complaining. I know I should be glad that he's often willing to accommodate me and that he sometimes genuinely does want to have sex all on his own (though typically only if I've suggested it earlier, and if he's got porn up on his phone) And sure, I hate that he needs porn to get turned on, but at least he's still willing to put it away and be with me once he's ready.

What upsets and worries me about it is that, for him, nothing was missing last night. And honestly, if I stopped initiating, idk if he would notice. I worry that he would notice but be relieved. 

I wish this wasn't so important to me. Here I am the next morning and I could barely talk to him as we got up got ready today, and when he asked me if I was ok I nearly cried but he was already running late and I didnt know what to say anyway.

Her doctor can't prescribe anymore tylenol-3 for her, so for the last month she's been taking 6-8 OTC tylenol a day and was planning to continue for a few months, which is really not good. But she couldn't afford our compound and she didn't think it would be strong enough anyway. But she's in a lot of pain, and her post-op healing is slowed by the fact that she has a 2 and 4 yo at home and no matter what people say, its actually impossible to never pick your kids up. But doing to is really slowing healing after her abdominal surgery.

So i got with my colleague and we approached the provider's office and asked them to consider a stronger pain cream, with a controlled substance in it, and told them we would find a way to make it affordable. This is not our usual modus operandi, but this seemed like a good reason to take the extra initiative. 

And guess what? Not only did the office prescribe her the meds, along with another one she had asked about which they didn't know we had, BUT - her plan paid for them. Both! Which means she now gets super strong pain cream that will actually help her, and she doesn't have to pay anything. She cried on the phone when I told her.

I love my job.

My bf [M26] definitely wants two more kids. I can maybe do one more, but only one. I don't think I can do two more.

The thing is, his desire for kids is not a passing thing, its really serious to him. He left his ex-wife because she didn't want babies (she was willing to adopt older kids but not have babies herself or adopt babies). This is non-negotiable for him. The number might be, maybe, but I don't have a lot of hope on that.

We've got about a year before we move in together, and I'm really unsure about this issue. I know people will tell me that I shouldn't have any children that I don't want, and I know that, but it's hard for me to tell whether the issue is that I don't want kids or I just don't want them if we can't afford them, and I know we can't right now and even in 3 years when we plan to start, it will be really tough to afford. 

Idk.
