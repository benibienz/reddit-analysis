59,"I'm sorry, but that is not the case.  The Japanese at the time still rejected the demand of the Potsdam declaration for Unconditional Surrender.  Unconditional Surrender was the demand that both the German and Italian governments agreed to upon their respected Surrenders.   The Italians tried to weasel out from under that too, until the Americans made it very clear that it was not a negotiable point.  The Soviets demanded it for the Germans, and so it became 100% non-negotiable for each of the three major Axis powers. 

Matter of fact, even after two Atomic bombs had been dropped on Japan the Japanese war cabinet still wanted to continue the war.  Right up until for the first time in Japanese history the Emperor waded directly into politics and order the surrender.  And that night, before the order was widely known, large parts of the Japanese military staged an attempted coup over the Emperors orders.  The Coup was put down, but not without difficulty.  It was only after the Emperor broadcast his order over the radio (another Japanese first, for his voice had never been broadcast before) that the military fully accepted that they had to surrender. 

Of course, the reasons that Japanese military were trying to weasel out of surrendering was that they knew what they had done.  Things like [Unit 731](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731) show that they were actively trying to do evil.  Unit 731 was not some kind of mistake made during the fog of war.... that's active ""Let's be evil"" territory there.

How many Russians died in on the Eastern Front?  Some estimates put Russian deaths at 20+ million.   The Germans then lost ~5 million invading and then retreating from the Soviet Union.

64,"Hey there fellow /r/History moderator.   Yeah, people who want to second guess the use Fat Man and Little Boy at the end of World War Two drive me nuts as well.  They always love to use various things said ten or twenty years after the war as if they were the contemporary consensus thinking in July/August, 1945.  

The fact of the matter is that:

(1) Japan had not surrendered.  
(2) nobody really knew how devastating a weapon those early nuclear weapons were going to be.  
(3) What the scientists knew (or may have known) is definitely not what President Harry Truman knew.  
(4) The war was very much still ongoing and many people thought an invasion of the Japanese home islands was going to be a major campaign with millions of dead on both sides.   For more than fifty years the US military didn't order more purple hearts, they had produced a large number in the lead up to what was going to be the invasion of Japan, and then the war was (to the average person) magically relieving over.  So the Pentagon didn't need to order anymore Purple hearts until the 1990s, and then the driving factor was not quantitative need, but stylistic changes in military award appearances.   In short, Purple Hearts were looking decidedly out of place when compared to other awards so minor tweaks were made.  

Also, imagine this situation.  August, 1945..... Harry Truman gets the reports about the Manhattan project, hears that the Atomic bombs are major weapons that may be too terrible to use.... so Truman decides to not use them.  Then Japan does not surrender and the Allies (95% Americans) invade the Japanese home islands.   Let's keep the death count low for this example, and only 200,000 American soldiers are killed.  Come 1947 Japan finally surrenders.  Then it's discovered that Truman shelved something called Atomic bombs, that somebody claims would have ended the war two years before hand (back in August of 1945).   

What happens to Truman?   What happens to the American Generals and Admirals that allowed Truman to shelve Fat Man and Little Boy?   Best case scenario involves Truman just losing the 1948 election.  And it could be a lot worse reaction wise too.  

And I think it's important to remember the time frame all this is happening during, in the Summer of 1945.  Truman wasn't just working on understanding the Atomic bombs...... he was in Potsdam for the Conferences with Stalin, Churchill (Later Attlee, as Britain swapped Prime Ministers in July, 1945), and lots of other world leaders, Generals, Admirals, all while he was still figuring out where the White House office supplies and bathrooms were located.   Truman and the US Political and Military leadership was looking into lots of different things, and while the Manhattan Project was important and got it's fair share of attention, I doubt that was more than whole days total of attention.  It was a very busy time..... maybe the busiest in the history of the USA. 

Yes, a lot of the players second guessed themselves twenty years later.  But that is because hind sight is always better.   But what was known by the President and others in 1945 was decidedly different. ",2016-10-31 02:18:56+00:00,d9etanu,2.0,t1_d9efjby,18474.0,SubredditDrama
65,"Well, the whole thing where Bernie pretended to be an independent is kind of a joke anyway.   

Bernie Sanders was always a Democrat, even when he claimed otherwise.  For most of his term in Congress and the Senate there has been a formal agreement between Sander's and the Democratic party that (1) the Democrats won't even run a nominal candidate against Bernie, and (2) Bernie agrees with Caucus with the Dems in Congress. 

The last time the Democrats even ran a nominal candidate against Sanders was in 1996.  But even then the Democratic party was raising money for Bernie.  And the then President and First Lady (somebody named Hilary somebody) hosted a fund raiser for Sanders in Vermont.  The President flew in to Vermont and meet with every Democrat running for office in Vermont that year, save one..... the guy who was the nominal candidate against Sanders.  

Bernie was the unofficial Democrat that year in 1996.  And since then the Democrats have never even tried to run against him.  Almost like they are actively supporting him or something.   In my view, that makes Sanders a Democrat.

66,"&gt; Just because a person has money doesn't mean their political endorsements are all about making more money.

Cases to point too: Roosevelt's and Kennedy's.  Say what you want about either Franklin Roosevelt or JFK, neither was using office to seek money.  They already had it.   

There is an old joke told about each of the Kennedy brothers went they were running for their Senate seats.  They got to a manufacturing plant to shake hands with workers as they go into the plant.   Guy walks up to (JFK, RFK, Teddy, take your pick) and says ""I hear you never worked an honest day's work in your life"".   Kennedy says that is basically true.   Next guy in line says ""Don't worry, Senator.  You haven't missed a thing"". 

What matters is does the candidate actually want to help people.  Or do they just want to aggrandize themselves.   I think Hilary Clinton comes out looking not just better than Trump, but better than most politicians.  ",2016-10-31 00:58:50+00:00,d9epnv7,9.0,t1_d9dymrq,36988.0,SubredditDrama

112,"It's hard to not respect Warren Buffett.  He endorsed Obama in 2008, and said he that while he respected McCain that he disagreed with him on too many thing to vote for him.   At the same time he was informally advising then Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson (in W' Bush's cabinet) through the early parts of the economic crisis.  

Paulson was forced to go hat in hand to Nancy Pelosi and ask her to make a deal with him to save the economy.   Cause at the time the majority of the Congressional Republicans seemed to be in favor of splashing it all into the toilet so they could score the equivalent of a Political Field Goal while guaranteeing that the rest of entire season would be lost.   I'm sure Buffett was one of those who told Paulson things were really in danger and that if a few GOP Congressman needed to be embarrassed, then that it was a small price for him to pay. 

In short, Buffett cares about politics but he's not going to let his short term political views prevent him from doing what it is right.

120,"The US has land borders.  That's true.   But in World War Oh-my-God how long do you think it would be before he US invaded and secured Canada and Mexico?  

Why must the assumption for this scenario involve the rest of the World doing everything it needs to do perfectly, while the US doesn't secure it's basic borders while waiting for the rest of the world to attack?

During World War Two the US started building two roads Alaska in the weeks immediately after Pearl Harbor.   The US Army Corp of Engineers didn't wait for permission from Ottawa to start the construction, they had teams in Canada building the roads before Jan 1st, 1942.   Ottawa was only finally and nominally asked it it was okay just weeks before the roads were finished in mid-1943. Ottawa then approved them in less than 24 hours after officially being asked too.   

William Lyon Mackenzie King made the British wait nines days before Canada declared war on Nazi Germany, as part of his efforts to emphasize that Canada was a separate nation from the United Kingdom.   But he then willingly turned a blind eye to the United States not asking for permission before our Army entered Canada to secure Alaska's connection to the Mainland United States. 

In short, at the beginning of World Was Oh-my-God the United States would immediately grab and sit on Canada, Mexico and the entire Caribbean and Latin American regions.  The US wouldn't just sit idly by and wait at the 48th parallel while the rest of the world turned Canada into a giant staging area for an invasion of the United States.  

The Germans didn't have the ability to stop the US and Britain from using Great Britain as such during World War Two, but the modern United States would have the ability to stop the rest of the World from using Canada and Mexico as said staging areas.

121,"One should also mention the many Aircraft carriers the US has in moth balls.  Roughly 10 other old aircraft carriers.  That if World War Oh-my-God scenario was to play out, would be rushed back into service.   That would add roughly another ten aircraft carriers to the US totals.  They aren't Nimitz class carriers, but each of them are still far larger than any other aircraft carrier the rest of the world operates.  

For example, the USS Kitty Hawk is current into the reserve fleet.  The plans are to turn it into a museum ship in a few years, but if World War Oh-My-God came to pass, I'm sure the Pentagon would find the money to put it back into the active fleet.   When it was fully loaded as an active warship in the US navy, it had 80,000+ tons of displacement.  Nimitz class ships are a little over 100,000 tons of displacement.  

Currently the largest non-American Aircraft carrier ever built is the French carrier Charles de Gaulle.  It's a large ship, but at about 40,000 tons of displacement it's about half the size of the USS Kitty Hawk.   And once again, to emphasize.... the USS Kitty Hawk is a carrier the US has currently moth balled as too old and to slow.  

And let's not forget to mention the ships that, to the uninitiated, look a lot like aircraft carriers, but which the US Navy instead classes as amphibious assault ships.   There are nine of those Wasp and America class ships.  They are each about 40,000 tons of displacement, and look a lot like Aircraft carriers, and aircraft do take off and land on them, but they are mostly used for attack helicopters, and then for also used as transport vessels and for rescue missions and other types of operations.  Things aircraft carriers are all very good at, but where you don't want to always use a giant Nimitz class ship for.   

All the US amphibious assault ships are all roughly the same size as the French carrier Charles de Gaulle, and the French have one Charles de Gaulle, while the US has nine Wash and America class ships. 

The US Navy just is the best navy ever to exist at this point.  And with a little work, it could be much larger.  As the World War Oh-my-God scenario would lead to the US putting a lot of retired ships back to service.  Ships that in many cases were only retired because they weren't needed.   They would be needed for World War Oh-my-God, and pressed back into service.  

In short, the rest of the world would need to built brand new aircraft carriers and other large ships. The US has a large reserve fleet and lots of old museum ships that could be pushed back into active service in a year or two.   Modern aircraft carriers take 5+ years to build.  So the US, France, China, Russia, India, Italy, etc, aren't going to build brand new ships the size of Nimitz class carriers in less than a year or even three.   By which time the US Nimitz class carriers are bombing the construction sites.  ",2016-10-08 04:05:29+00:00,d8iumlm,8.0,t1_d8icqab,28167.0,SubredditDrama

At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer. If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad.

132,"When it comes to Iran, a lot of content needs to be remembered.   First off, the Coup and Counter-Coup (yes, two coups) in Iran in 1952 and 1953 happened with the major backdrop of the Cold War at it's hottest.   Stalin had only just died.   Iran had been jointly occupied by the Soviets and British during World War Two.  In 1941 Pahlavi Shah was installed as Shah of Iran by a Coup jointly sponsored by the Soviets and Brits to remove Pahlavi Shah's father from the throne.   Pahlavi Shah father was thought to be pro-German in WW2. 

Then in 1952 and 1953 Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh looked to nationalize the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.  He was thought to possibly be Pro-Soviet or at least Socialist.  The West was really worried about possible Soviet influence in Iran and the greater Middle East.   As such, they wanted to prevent the Soviets from gaining a major foothold there.  

That's the background for why the British and Americans supported the Shah.  

So for 25 years Iran was ruled by the Shah.  One of he few ways dissent could  be safely displayed was in the guise of religion. 

Then later in 1979 came the built up reaction to the excesses of the Shah.  The Iranian people rose up against the Shah while he was out of the country.   For years religious people where at the forefront of criticism of the government.... so when it came time to pick a new government, a lot of folks wanted a religious government.  

Also, remember that Iranian politics is complicated.   A lot of people look at the counter coup that ousted Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh as a major cause of the Iranian revolution later.... but that's not a direct contributor.   For while the then new Islamic Government of Iran hated the Shah big time, demanding that he be returned to Iran for trail and execution, one must remember that the Islamic Leaders of Iran also didn't like Mohammad Mosaddegh, who was the second most hated figure to them.  Mostly because he was a Secular leader who didn't like religion being mixed with politics and if your an Supreme Leading Ayatollah, you really want to mix religion with your politics.  

Now a days the Supreme Leader of Iran works to actively prevent a person like Mohammad Mosaddegh from gaining any power.   Internal Iranian politics is often misunderstood in the West, and simplistically viewed as just Shah vs. Ayatollah, when in actuality it's more complicated than that.   Bear in mind also that the Iranians are guilty of this same thing in reverse when they look at Western and American politics.

[Frances Oldham Kelsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Oldham_Kelsey) was the person who worked for the FDA who refused to authorize thalidomide for market because she had concerns about the drug's safety.   Her efforts are what lead to it being pulled in the European and other foreign markets.  In short, the US based FDA that did the heavily lifting on the issue for the entire world.

* Treat all Hispanics as probable illegal aliens.  
* He went out of his way to point out that the Supreme Court ruling making Japanese internment legal has never been overturned and that he would like to use it against Muslims and Hispanics.   That's more than 44 million people he says he wants to put into internment camps.  And if you think he's going to stop are simple interment, then you stupid.   He'll go full Nazi-death camp on them.   That's more Americans than live in the state of California.  
* He's pro-Torture, even in cases where  **he knows it does not work**.
* He wants to attack ISIS and escalate all the Middle East Conflicts, up to and including the use of Nuclear weapons. 
* He wants to get rid of the minimum wage law entirely, and pay lots of people nothing. At the same time he wants to eliminate what is left of the social-safety nets that help millions of Americans, including millions of American children.

209,"With regard to the post-Stalin era in the Soviet Union, one really needs to read up on Khrushchev's Secret speech in 1956, which he titled [On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Cult_of_Personality_and_Its_Consequences).   It was of such impotence that it was at once secret and at the same time he allowed it to be leaked to the West.   

In short, the Soviet government viewed the excesses of Stalin as not Communist or Socialist, and more as problems that emanated from Stalin himself.  

Also, remember.....even into the 1980s, the Soviets looked powerful to both themselves and the rest of  the World.   Gorbachev didn't think the USSR would disintegrate.   Not until well after there was no-preventing it.    Which is probably why when it did finally happened it went mostly non-violently.  

There was a now somewhat famous meeting of high-level people from the Pentagon and the US Intelligence services where from the late 1980s.   At this meeting, a report was being given about the Soviet Union.  The authors of the paper said something like ""Well, all our analysis would obviously be wrong if something very unexpected were to happen"".    He was pushed for ""unexpected what?"" and he proffered ""Well, if the Soviet Union fell apart into constituent countries or something equally unforeseen"".   At this point then CIA Deputy Director (and future Secretary of Defense) Robert Gates stood up and somewhat angrily yelled across the room ""Those people (meaning the Soviets) aren't going anywhere"".  

A few years later the Soviet Union fell apart.  

You are looking at the USSR from the wrong point of view.   In the 1950s to even the late 1980s, many people thought they might have the better all-around system.   Even those who disagreed with it vehemently were worried that it might well be the stronger and more powerful approach. 

So few people saw the collapse of the USSR coming.   It seems obvious now, but at the time it wasn't. ",2016-07-18 03:17:33+00:00,d5gdy2h,1.0,t3_4t7h71,93723.0,history
210,"Even the Anti-Establishment rhetoric is a right wing talking point.  The first candidate to use it was Bob ""Mr. Conservative"" Taft, then Senator from Ohio.  First used in 1944 when he tried to get the Republican nomination from Thomas Dewey.  He then used it again in both 48 and 52, against Dewey and Eisenhower respectively.  But he real target each time was Franklin Roosevelt (or his memory).  

Then Richard Nixon picked up the whole ""Anti-Establishment"" talking point in 1960, 1968 and 1972.   

Raging against the evil Liberal Establishment was invented  by the Republicans.   The fact that they got Sanders' supporters to adopt it must be one of the far rights greatest achievements.   Bernie Sanders' supporters are tools of the far right wing of the Republican party.

Atatürk was Mustafa Kemal, who was the founding leader of Turkey.

Then at the end of World War One he became the leader of Turkey as opposed to the Ottoman Empire (though by then there wasn't much difference).   He was basically the person who decided the Ottoman Empire, even as a legal fiction, was done. 

He believed in making the new Turkey a secular nation.   With a minimal religious influence or power.    He encouraged Westernization pretty much across the board.  

The Turkish military view themselves as the defenders of the legacy of Atatürk.  It's a role they have taken very seriously over the years.     It's been a while since they have staged a coup.   The last one was in 1980.

221,"&gt;I would agree that US text books, particularly for high school and earlier are hopelessly corrupted with revisionism and whatever the current political emphasis happens to be.

I wouldn't argue that at all.   The issue is that grade school and even high school level history classes (well, social studies) are trying to convey the basic lay of the land without adding so much detail as to be over the head of those they are teaching.  

So, yes.... simple narratives are given.   But they are narratives that one can build on and add too as once gains more experience and information.    This is often emphasized to students..... who since it doesn't effect them much, mostly ignore it.   The kids just want to know enough to pass the test, and so they ignore the qualifiers.   Then 10 or 20 years later they complain that ""I was lied too"" when that didn't happen at all. 

People often choose what to remember from their own lives, and would even sometimes reject video evidence proving X-event from their live happened very differently.   This same thing happens with what people think they were taught, choosing instead to remember an even simpler narrative then what they were actually taught.  

The classic example people like to scream about is Columbus being hailed as a the guy who Discovered the New World.  And yes, that's basically poetic license being somewhat misapplied.   As he couldn't discover someplace that already had people living there.  

So, then it becomes Columbus was the European who first sailed to the Americas.   And that's not even fully true, mostly cause of that pesky Lief Erikson.   But the Erikson journeys were not all that significant in their own time.   And they were brief and didn't really go much of anywhere.   

We know this because disease didn't go rip through the New World after that 1000 CE contact.    The reasons for that are several.... mostly having to do with (1) Northern climate in Newfoundland, which itself was (2) an island (somewhat isolated from the mainland) that was somewhat sparsely populated by natives.    Natives that for the most part (3) stayed away from the Norse who showed up.    Those three factors coupled with the short duration of contact saved a bunch of Native American lives.  

Where as the disease vectors take off pretty immediately when it comes to the Spanish contact in the Caribbean and then in Mexico.   Hot weather, lots of natives, and everybody fairly willing to jump into bed with each other pretty quickly.  And then for the Spanish to then use those disease epidemics to their advantage when it came to conquering the New World.   (Conversations that probably went something like this: ""So, hey there.....   while your coughing your guts out I would just like to make sure were all in agreement on who's is charge around here now?"")

As you can see, these things get very complicated rather quickly.  So, yes.... schools have a tendency to teach very simplified narratives in the early years.    It's not out of malice of trying to push a certain story for political reasons (most of the time), but is just born of the effort to keep things easy to understand.   

The mistake people make is in assuming that they are every taught the full 100% detail about any subject.   They aren't.  This is true for history, math, English, science, health, music, art, even PE.  There is always more detail to learn.

227,"The Anti-GMO People.   I just normally bring up Norman Borlaug with them.   Borlaug was credited with having saved one billion human lives in 1970.  Today the number would be at least 3 billion, probably more.  

[Norman Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug) supported GMOs.   

He saved the lives of billions of people in the [Green Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution).   He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970, when he was already well known for then having saved One Billion lives. 

He was sure that if he had had access to GMO technology back when the Green Revolution was starting, that could have saved millions more.  In his quest to produce pest resistant forms of Corn and Wheat, they needed to produce tens of thousands of manually produced cross breeds.   You have to grow each of those cross breads, determine if they work, and then confirm that they work.  And while corn and wheat grow quickly, they still take weeks to months to grow.  All to find 5-10 individual breeds that met their initial requirements.    Where as he figured that GMO produced strains would have saved his teams years worth of research time.   

And in those years how many millions died of starvation?

Borlaug said a few things that I think are important:

---

&gt;I now say that the world has the technology – either available or well advanced in the research pipeline – to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people. The more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology? While the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low-risk positions, and pay more for food produced by the so-called “organic” methods, the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income, food-deficit nations cannot.

--- 

&gt;Some of the environmental lobbyists of the western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are elitists. They have never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels. If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they would be crying out for tractors, and fertilizer, and irrigation canals, and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things. 

---

In short, I think we need to heed the words of Borlaug.   He not only knew what he was talking about, but he proved it time and time again through his long career.  There is a good argument to be made that he was the single most influential person to have ever lived.  Mexico, Pakistan, India, China, etc. are all net-good exporters today.  In the first three the core-work itself was done directly by Borlaug, in China it was done by Chinese Government officials who were purposely copying Borlaug's work, all while consulting directly with him.    

As a percentage of the human population, there are fewer people starving today than at any point other in human history.   That's because of Norman Borlaug.

Taken for all in all, I would be 99% happy if Bernie Sanders could get the Democratic Party nomination.  But I'm 95% happy with Hillary Clinton.   Anyone who wants to burn the entire country down over 3-4% of little difference is crazy.  To the point that I don't want to support anyone they would support.  

I get the feeling that a lot of them are children who never were told no.   ""We want ice cream for dinner"", and parents gave in.  Continuously for years.    Then along comes the day when they are only allowed to order three Big Macs (instead of the four they wanted) at McDoland's and so they get Dad's gun and kill their parents.  

When they say things like ""After Four years of Trump and America will be ready to elect Bernie"" or whatever are scary.  There are people who need health care and food stamp.   People who will be hurt if Trump kills Obama-care or eliminates the food stamp program.    

Some of these people don't understand that people can easily die from disease and starve to death in four years.   They act like self-entitled pricks and then wonder why the rest of the Democratic Party voted for somebody else.

Bernie Sander's biggest problem as a candidate was his rabid supporters.  A good number of them seem to want to hurt people to teach them a lesson.  A lot of lower class people can't afford to lose their benefits for 4-8 years.    A good number of them are unemployed because they can't work.  Take away their social safety net and they will have to hope the local charities can feed them.  

I have an aunt who has a bunch of medical problems.   She can barely walk from the bedroom to the living room.  When she uses the rest room it's a half-hour process for her.   She can't go get a low paying job at the mall.   She sees lots of doctors and the medicare program and some private insurance they have are something that is a difference between life and death for her.  They are poor enough to quality for some food stamp assistance as well.   

Take these things away from people, and a non-trivial number of them will just die.   I don't see why anyone who claims to be a Progressive Liberal can be okay with that.  ",2016-07-07 18:04:17+00:00,d5341na,3.0,t1_d52xnxc,7810.0,SubredditDrama

252,"I would be willing to beat that they cost significantly less.  But the reason that they spend less money is going to be the same general reason for their high achievement.   In short, Charter Schools get to pick their students, and as such they pick the creme of the crop, the best students.  Most of whom have very active family participation the learning process, parents who can easily take time off from work to attend school functions and help their children with homework, and often hire tutors and the like to help their children with subjects and material they may find more difficult.

Charter schools don't actively recruit the hard to reach students or the ones with special needs.  Kids who need extra-attention for whatever reason are going to use more money from the school budget.   Get rid of the expensive drains on the budget, and you save money. 

Where as the average public school can't just kick the special needs kids out.   And the students with parents who are working two or three jobs to put food on the table at home, they aren't showing up for parent-teacher conferences.   

These are factors that will make a charter school appear to cost significantly less.     But if you require them to accept all applicants, period.....  I would predict that savings would vanish immediately.   I wouldn't be surprised if they turned out to cost more.   

As to why Obama and Clinton and other Democrats support charter schools.... that's mostly because most voters, on both sides of the political spectrum, think Charter schools are better.  Mostly because they have had a dislike for the traditional public school system beaten into them by the press for decades.   

Rarely do you see a news story about charter schools explain how they look better simply because they get to choose their own student body, rather than having to accept all students from the general population.  I don't think it's a conspiracy or anything, as it seems to be something that falls outside he normal feel-good human interest story that is what most of the press attention on charter schools comes from.     

In short, people think charter schools are all great because of a lack of information on the problem of education on the whole.    And some politicians fall into the trap of giving the voters what they ask-for rather than explaining to them what they need. 

This isn't a problem with either of the political parties.   It's human nature.   A lot of the guys who try and explain what voters actually need often get rejected for those same voters.   Politicians have learned, as most other people have, that there are situations where you don't fight back on what they see as smaller issue because then they aren't in the room for other battles that need to be fought later.

254,"To support what you say, I want to note that [Norman Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug) supported GMOs.   

He saved the lives of billions of people in the [Green Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution).   He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970, when he was already well known for then having saved One Billion lives.   Today the numbers would be at least 3-4 billion human lives. 

He was sure that if he had had access to GMO technology back when the Green Revolution was starting, that could have saved millions more.  In his quest to produce pest resistant forms of Corn and Wheat, they needed to produce tens of thousands of manually produced cross breeds.   You have to grow each of those cross breads, determine if they work, and then confirm that they work.  And while corn and wheat grow quickly, they still take weeks to months to grow.  All to find 5-10 individual breeds that met their initial requirements.    Where as he figured that GMO produced strains would have saved his teams years worth of research time.   

And in those years how many millions died of starvation?

Borlaug said a few things that I think are important and which I think address some of your detractors underlying yet unwarranted assumptions.  

---

&gt;I now say that the world has the technology – either available or well advanced in the research pipeline – to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people. The more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology? While the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low-risk positions, and pay more for food produced by the so-called “organic” methods, the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income, food-deficit nations cannot.

--- 

&gt;Some of the environmental lobbyists of the western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are elitists. They have never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels. If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they would be crying out for tractors, and fertilizer, and irrigation canals, and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things. 

---

In short, I think we need to head the words of Borlaug.   He not only know what he was talking about, but he proved it time and time again through his long career.  There is a good argument to be made that he was the single most influential person to have ever lived.  Mexico, Pakistan, India, China, etc. are all net-good exporters today.  In the first three the core-work itself was done directly by Borlaug, in China it was done by Chinese Government officers who were purposely copying Borlaug's work.    

As a percentage of the human population, there are fewer people starving today than at any point other in human history.   That's because of Norman Borlaug.

One could even view it see it as part of the [New Journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Journalism).  Maybe never as [Gonzo journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_journalism), but only because Wiesel probably never started a massive drug collection. 

&gt;“We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.

The UK then joined in 1973.  They originally applied in 1961, but de Gaulle vetoed that early application.

273,"Jack Kemp was always a weird Republican because he courted the African American community.  He regularly went to people he knew actively disagreed with him on just about everything politically.   But he connived them that he actually cared.  As such, Kemp was always able to get about 40% of the African American vote in his district.  And when and East Buffalo resident called his Congressional office looking for help, he didn't say ""They didn't vote for me, so ignore them"". He stilled tried to help them. 

Kemp was the last Republican who was able to work with the African American community with a good relationship and mutual respect on both sides.    

You see, they worked with one another and and built relationships.  You don't want to value these but most people value their friends and relationships.  Even when they disagree with somebody.  

You didn't understand the point I was trying to make before.  Part of that is in part my fault, I didn't think I should have to drive it point-blank home.  You see, I thought you were smart enough to get the point without my driving it home directly. 

But I'll take the hit on that.  Now let me state it directly.  

Bernie Sanders is thought by Minorities to have never done anything for them.   Oh, he may vote for things they like from time to time, but he isn't doing it for them.  They think he's doing it to make himself feel superior.     He never worked with them in the past, and they aren't going to listen to what sound like empty promises.  

Where as Hillary Clinton has courting their votes for years. She has actively helped them for decades now.   They don't view her promises as empty because she has delivered for them in the past. They know they are doing her a favor in return, but it's based on the partners mutual understanding of one another.  

Bernie Sanders wants to fight the good fight and then lose and then say to the African American community that ""I would love to help you if I could but I just can't"".    Where as Hillary Clinton wants to get stuff done, and actually make their lives a little better.  They don't care if she comes off as scheming, political or even manipulative just as long as the work actual gets accomplished.   That progress is made.  

In short, they can't afford to lose.   Sanders and many of his supporters are fine with fighting the good fight and losing.  Sanders is worried about keeping the moral high ground.   But many people, dare I say even the vast majority, just don't have the luxury to care for keeping up appearances.   Appearances don't feed your family.

276,"You know, some months ago, during the lead up to the North Carolina primary, an older black member of the North Carolina State Senate was speaking to a crowd of Bernie Sanders supporters.   He is Baptist minister and just shy of 80 years old now, and has been involved in the Civil Rights movement since the 1950s when the Klan would openly show up at this home and threaten to murder him.   

He was explaining what he supports.   Mostly it was stuff out of the Sanders campaign playbook, especially on issues of income inequality and college tuition needs.   All the kids in the audience was loving everything he was saying.  Right up until the point when he said that those are all the same reasons he has endorsed Hillary Clinton for President.   They all went insane and started screaming at the old man, but he kept on. 

You see, he continued to explain, he's meet both Bill and Hillary Clinton more times than he can count.  He's had dinner at their homes, and had them to dinner at his home.  He's knows them both very well, since the late 1930s.   They help him raise money for his campaigns for the North Carolina state senate.  They solicit his opinions on matters they know he cares about.   They have had and maintained a relationship with him for 30+ years.    Because they have broken bread with him on dozens of occasions, he has had time to get to know them.   He knows and trusts them. 

Then he mentioned that has met Bernie Sanders only twice in his long career.  Both times in the last year, and each time for less than two minutes each.  Sanders never asked him for his opinions on anything.  Bernie Sanders' just assumed that because he politically agrees with him that therefore this old Black Baptist Minister should support him regardless of anything else.   

He's known the Clinton's and knows that they agree with him on most things.   Sanders agrees with him, but Sanders has never once attempted to actually form a real relationship with him or his constituents.   So he's going to support Hillary Clinton.  

You see, what Sanders and you don't understand is that relationships matter.  Sanders was up in Vermont doing stuff for people in Vermont, which is all fine and good.   But he has  never made campaign swings through Southern States helping to elect Black Progressive Democrats to office.  A lot of these Southern States are Republican held territory and it's hard for the Progressive Democrats to break through into office.    Bill and Hillary Clinton have been wading into those fights for years now, often in losing efforts.  But through that time they have made friends and built political relationships.  

In short, as Former Speaker Tip O'Neill said, ""people like to be asked"".  Which Tip O'Neill relates  in his autobiography was something he had to learn the hard way, when his own neighbor didn't vote for him once.   Why, he asked her?  ""You never asked for my vote"" was her response.    O'Neill always went out of his way to kindly ask people for their votes from then on.   

In short, I'm voting for Lord Varys over Lord Stark.   Ned and his honor got his head removed from his body.  He cared more for what things looked like, while Varys actually cares about the realm and doesn't care what people think of him.  ",2016-06-25 20:30:36+00:00,d4nvnmu,6.0,t1_d4ntfzt,3766.0,progressive

But I will bet a hundred thousand donuts that the reason Pallas posted this is much more out of exasperation than anything else.  He probably had twenty++ mod mails to /r/Reddit.com or /r/Spam mod mail so unanswered before he finally got a response.  And another thing, you admins still play the game of ""no, you need to message this other mod mail address instead when you aren't totally ignoring mod mail all together.

Especially since you guys play the game of musical mod mail pointers that often turn into Vogon bureaucracy.

And [this is a spammer I just reported today](https://www.reddit.com/r/spam/duplicates/4poesa/overview_for_salamivodka_this_is_the_20th_time/).

And then we're ignored when we message the admins.  Often by several different methods of commutation.   And then when one guy who reports a lot of spammers losses his cool..... then you want to hold that against him.  Really. 

I'm sorry, but I'm going to say it.... Pallas is right, your wrong.  Period.   And I don't care who down votes me for saying it directly to your face (well, sort of.  As much as the comment system on Reddit will allow).   I've got karma to burn and Pallas is one of the people who I'm willing to burn it for.

That's a loser play, as 4-5 months isn't long enough to win the campaign.   So I would allow for a very outside possibility that they look at the Libertarian ticket of Gary Johnson and Bill Weld.  Both former Republican governors of New Mexico and Massachusetts.   It's still going to lose, but there is always some weird outside chance that it sparks real interest.  

The question would be do they want to lose with only 150 electoral votes that McCain or Romney would get, or go for a 99% chance of getting less than 30 but having a wacky really outside the box type of a win.

301,"The most notable thing about President Hayes is how he was elected.    The only time the United States ever used Extra-Constitutional means to determine the outcome of a Presidential election. 

Hayes didn't win the popular vote either, his opponent Samuel J. Tilden, Governor of New York, had received 50.9% of the popular vote.  

The results from three states were in dispute:  Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina.  As well as one electoral vote from Oregon was also in question.   In total 20 electoral votes were in dispute.  

To win, Hayes would needed to be awarded all 20 electoral votes.  Tilden would have won the White House if he was declared the winner of any of the 20 electoral votes.

Normally what would happen Constitutionally is that the House of Representatives would count the Electoral votes and determine which slates of electors to count.   But it was only a decade after the Civil War and the three whole states in question were each former Confederate states.  So on the whole the House of Reps didn't want to deal with the mess directly.    It was political Kryptonite. 

So instead an [Electoral Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_States%29) was setup for the only time in US-history.   It included five members of the House, five Senators and five Supreme Court Justices.   There were eight republicans on it and seven democrats.  And in the end everyone votes strict party-lines and Hayes was elected 8 to 7.   Well, officially they were only awarding the 20 electoral votes to Hayes.  

Since everyone kind of saw that coming, [backroom deals were struck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1877) ahead of the final ruling.   Mostly to avert unrest when Hayes was finally formally declared the winner.

Say what you want, but Hillary Clinton got four-million more votes than her Democratic Opponent.    The supporters of Bernie Sanders want to tell everyone how great their candidate is, and how can he be great if he lost to somebody they think is all-around bad.   So instead of concluding that Sanders was worse than maybe they thought, a good number of them instead decide that the Hillary Clinton supporters don't actually exist in real numbers, so everything about her instead becomes a giant conspiracy.  

The same is happening with Trump.   Who says often contradictory things.  And sometimes not just changes positions, but often changes them in mid-speech and occasionally in mid-sentence.     They don't want to believe that is happening, so they blow things up into a conspiracy.  

Google is the most popular search platform, so it's the one that the most fake conspiracies are going to exist about in the common political zeitgeist. 

This has been demonstrated to be wrong since it became a thing in the news.   The evidence has always been there that it is wrong.   But the Breitbart people want to believe it and don't care about the actual evidence.  

Everyone claims to desiring high level political debate in this country, but instead most just want to throw shit at their opponents.    I don't like Trump and we'll say a lot of bad things about him, but I can't stand the Drumpf people who attack his name as if that was something Donald Trump has something to do with changing.  That name change happened long ago, before Trump or even Trumps father were born.  It was part of a standard name change that happened in families often back then.  

A lot of people people with the last name of *Kaiser* immigrated to the US and changed the family name to *King* instead.   It wasn't a vast conspiracy, it was just part of the then common practice of Anglicizing their names.   If people had moved the other direction, they might well have Germanified their names from *King* to *Kaiser* in the reverse.  

The reasons to dislike Trump don't really extend to his name.   The reasons to dislike Hillary don't really exist to Google Search results.   People, it seems, often prefer dumb reasons to dislike somebody that they think they understand over good reasons that they might not fully grasp.

My mother was in a hospice situation where she had less than 10 days to live.    Don't worry, she didn't make it those ten days.  

You see, she was in SCREAMING TORTURE style pain.   The cancer had eaten most of his intestines and stomach, and there wasn't much left except a shit load of pain.   The doctors didn't want to give her morphine for the pain.   You see, they were worried she might get addicted.   

I'm now going to repeat the fact that she was in hospice.   She was expected to die.   The doctors were afraid to prescribe the needed pain meds not because they were actually worried about anything, but because there are Federal Government agents with offices in hospitals and no training in drugs who look over prescriptions for things like morphine and give doctors shit for actually making use of it.  

I had to have a shit fit with several doctors and two Federal agents before they all agreed to allow my mother to get the drugs she needed.    And that was only because I threatened to sic the local press on them.   I smartly wrote down all their names at the beginning of a meeting and then said I would be visiting the local newspaper and telling them how they personally all get-off on torturing dying old ladies.

There were events like the [Armenian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide) and the [Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor), but those were largely unknown by the general public except for those who were directly effected by them.

Previous to the Holocaust there was a long string of [Pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom) against Jewish communities in Europe from time to time.   I don't think there is a European country that didn't have one from time to time.   That said, by the late 19th century they seemed to finally be a thing of the past.  

Sadly..... the Holocaust can now be viewed as the worst pogrom ever, but in some ways just another (hopefully the last) in a long string of sad, deadly events.  

Before the 20th century, a lot of events weren't known world wide.   Or maybe it would be better to say only European events were known in some detail on a world wide basis.  But that was because of then European domination around the world.    Sad events happened in China several times, where individual uprising, civil wars, revolts, etc.,normally termed as [rebellions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rebellions_in_China#Qing_dynasty) were often long and very bloody affairs, but are still mostly (with a few exceptions) unknown outside of China.  

But that is widening the scope of your original question to even look at events like those. 

Still, The Holocaust is probably truly unique not in that it happened, but that it's the one-event like that which is so well known.   That is largely true probably more before of when it happened (very recently in history) rather than because it happened.  ",2016-06-10 18:07:05+00:00,d43xbxx,1.0,t3_4nh3d4,6183.0,history

That said, she had already dragged the PUMA people into line months before.    She did that because she viewed Obama as a much better alternative to McCain.  it wasn't even a real choice in her mind.   

If Bernie can't figure out that Hillary Clinton, a person he agrees with on 93% of the issues, is better than Donald Trump, a supporter of:

* Torture, even if it doesn't work. Say what you want about Cheney and the Bush guys, but they had to the where-with-all to think it was sometimes required and they were ashamed of having to resort to it.  Trump wants to torture people even if you prove to him it doesn't help anything.  
* Trump has said the internment of Japanese Americans during World War Two was a good thing.   And that he would consider doing the same to Muslim and Hispanic Americans.   That would be more than 40 million people, more people than live in California.   And if you think he's going to stop at simple internment, then you're crazy.

As one of them, I am just sick to death at watching the left repeatedly commit political suicide because of stupid ass purity tests that they demand Hillary meet, yet even Sanders himself can't pass said tests. 

I'm sorry, but the United States has come a long way on several fronts.  Gay Marriage is now the law of the land.  But it's not because of people like Sanders who demanded it on day-one.   It's because of people like Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.   People the Sanders camp want to tar with the Flip Flopper label, when it actuality they were getting the American people used to the idea.  Until one day it as just approved of by almost all Americans, and even a right winger like Judge Roberts couldn't deny it any longer.  

The Stonewall riots happened in 1968.   But the reason the police went to the Stonewall inn that day was because Most Americans then approved of their beating gay people.   Now such action is pretty much unthinkable. 

We need more politicians who step the American  people up and show them what they need to be showed.  Simply demanding that the Americana people change their minds about things is not actual leadership.  

What we have in Hillary Clinton is somebody a little like LBJ.    See ""All the Way"" about Lyndon Johnson and how get got Civil Rights passed.   He didn't care about the feelings of the various players.   It was political judicious of him to piss off people like Martin Luther King, Jr at times.   Why?  Because he needed votes to get the bill passed through Congress.  And when you need Republican support for something,  you are only going to get that Republican support from the Republicans. 

Sanders is just going to demand that people vote with him.  And when that happens nobody except people who already agree with him are going to vote with him.    And I'm sorry if you don't like this fact, but it's still the fact of the matter.....but that's less than 10% of Congress right now.    You aren't going to get Medicare for all from Bernie Sanders.

Hillary might not get Medicare for all.  But she'll get 10-20 million more people covered.    And I'm sorry, but those people need the help.

And now you are going to question if Trump would be bad as President.

He'll do even worse, as he will put millions upon millions of American citizens of Hispanic and Muslim decent into camps.

Bernie Sanders lost.  Not liking this fact does not change it.  

Many of us are also sick and tired of idiotic Democrats believing bold faced lies made up by Republicans about Hillary Clinton's record and character.     And the only reason many people choose to believe those lies is because her name isn't Bernie Sanders.   Quite frankly, I am going to be point blank about this..... His supporters have made it impossible for many of us to ever support Sanders as a Presidential candidate.   And why should we?  

If Sanders supporters don't want to support Clinton when he has lost, then I don't think the Democratic party is bound to support him either.     He got fewer votes.  He is clearly the weaker candidate.  

There is an agreement between Bernie Sanders and the Vermont Democratic Party.  The Democrats don't run candidates against Sanders in Vermont.   This allowed Bernie to be ""independent"" in a legal fiction, and in turn.... the independent candidate was informally backed by the Democratic party support.  

Well, seems to me that what's good for the goose is good for the gander.    The Democratic Party need to consider breaking this agreement with Sanders and start actively running candidates against him in Vermont.   In effect, why shouldn't the Democratic party work to run him out the Senate entirely?      I know some are going to scream bloody murder of this idea.  But really, at this point.... the real Democratic party shouldn't care what they think.  

If you don't want to support the person who won your parties nomination, then your party is under no obligation to continue to support your candidate in any way.  To quote Isaac Asimov:  ""It’s a poor atom blaster that won’t point both ways"".

When they are presented with it, it's more of a ""This is a funny thing that happened"" story.  And then the anger builds on the humor aspect of it.  Which leads to a feedback loop that doesn't allow for the actual facts to interfere with the entertaining aspects of the story.  

On top of that, there are some people who were actively using the false narrative to try and effect public policy.    Which adds another layer to the false aspects of the story.  There the feedback loop is used to actively cause more false info to be spread.

Or ""Once in a century figure"".     When really, you get a Bernie Sanders type of person in American politics at least once a decade.  

* Ben Bradley, 2000
* Paul Tsongas, 1992
* Michael Dukakis, 1988
* Walter Mondale, 1984
* Ted Kennedy, 1980
* Mo Udall, 1976
* George McGovern, 1972
* Robert Kennedy, 1968
* Eugene McCarthy, 1968
* Henry Wallace, 1948
* Robert La Follette, 1924

And we could add Ron Paul a few times, 2008.   H. Ross Perot in 1992.   Teddy Roosevelt in 1912.    Though none of them are left-wingers, each has a good share of some Sanders-like aspects to there character.  

And there are others that could be added to this list, like some people who were elected President.....  I purposely left Presidential winners off the list.     (TR lost in 1912, he was elected in 1904, and served 3+ years of the second McKinley term.   1912 was his attempt at ousting his hand-picked successor, President Taft, mostly cause he thought Taft had gone soft on some things..... probably more ego than anything real). 

Bernie Sanders like figures wander in and our of American history.   And Sanders himself isn't even the most notable of them.   That would be the RFK-Gene McCarthy combo in 1968....  Both were popular leftists Junior Senators who were against the Vietnam war.    The McCarthy people and the Kennedy people didn't get along.    McCarthy supporters accused RFK of getting into the race only because he saw McCarthy doing well.   The Kennedy people would say McCarthy didn't know how government really functioned.    Kennedy seemed to finally be starting to get a handle on driving at the nomination, but it was still far from a sure thing.   Humphrey was still there, not taking part in the primaries and waiting for a convention fight.....    Then RFK was assassinated and everything went to hell.  

In a span of six months, the Democrats had four people trying to control the party.   In he end, LBJ forced the convention to give Humphrey the nomination, but wouldn't let him come out against the war until there were just a few weeks left in the election.   The assassination,  the riots at the convention....   LBJ doing LBJ-like things when people were obviously sick of him (maybe unfairly) ....  so the country turned to Nixon in an attempt to find some peace.    

It wasn't the American people being crazy either.  I haven't yet mentioned George Wallace in this little write up, you have to understand that even in retrospect (taking all we now know about him) Nixon wasn't the most unpalatable candidate running that year.  

Anyway, this election season isn't 1968.   Or 1912 or 1876 or 1860 or 1824.   In a lot of ways, it's mostly just a more orange version of 2008.

And not over anything important here.  It won't be over Russian troops pouring through Eastern Europe and into Germany and the Fulda gap.   It will be over something really stupid, like ""Putin looked at me wrong"".  

There are stories about his business dealings that are circulating.   He's filed for Bankruptcy four times, and in one of the cases there was a Bankruptcy deal to be had.   He would have been able to keep his ownership stake, and all the employees would have kept their jobs.   It wasn't his idea though, so instead he took a giant loss and nearly all the employees were let go.   That's a self-inflicted wound to him, but he's got money and doesn't care about losing a little if he gets to retain his pride.  But the employees all got fucked good and hard.  Over something that wasn't their fault.  

I put the chances of Trump starting a nuclear war at over 20% in just four yeas.   That's way too high.   Where as even Reagan never took the country into a 1% chance.   And he talked a big stupid game at times.  

A nuclear exchange would kill billions of people.   He'd be a worse mass murderer than Hitler, Stalin and Mao combined.  

I'm sorry, but I am not willing to take that chance.  

Hillary Clinton will be a President a lot like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.   Those are the two best US Presidents in the post-Vietnam era.  If that's not good enough for you, then your standards are totally unreasonable.    

Yes, I would love another FDR, but FDR was only granted all that power and policy latitude because the US economy had totally shit the bed, was experiencing 25% unemployment, Baks were failing left and right, and then there was a World War.   A world war that was the largest single war in the entire history of mankind.    In short, all hell had broken lose.  Presidents aren't granted that kind of opportunity to make large scale policy changes short of everything actually breaking down.

Bernie Sanders is not unique and there has been several people like him previously.  The idea that nobody like him has ever run for President before..... just prima facie wrong.  

A lot of Sanders supporters want to believe something so much that they are willing to lie..... probably mostly to themselves.   Sanders is a good Senator.   But a lot of people just having trouble seeing him as President.  

Myself, I think Presidents need to make tough choices.     And in looking at Sanders career, I don't see any time where he has to make a tough, and unpopular decision.    He's from Vermont, they love his very liberal stance of things there.   He won his last election with 71% of the vote.    Which means as long as he avoids doing really bad things, like killing and eating children, he won't piss off his electorate to the point that he would have to worry about losing his next election.    

I want to see Sanders make an unpopular decision that could cost him his Senate seat.  If he actually still makes the unpopular call, then I'll consider believing some of the hype around him.   

I almost am very turned off by the Sanders supporters who refuse to understand basic mathematics.   Hillary has a little more then 2200 delegates now.   She needs only ~200 to wrap it all up.   Even if she loses California (which won't happen) , there are 475 delegates up for grabs there.   So if she just wins 48% of the vote there, losing the state.... she'll get more than 200 delegates and we're done at that point.  Hillary wins the Democratic Nomination. 

Sanders doesn't just have to win all the remaining states.  He has to basically get nearly every vote remaining.  If Hillary Clinton gets just 20% of the vote in all the remaining states, she still wins.   Sanders isn't going to get 100% of the remaining vote.   

Mathematics matters.  It's as if the Sanders people seem to reject it wholesale and instead believe basic arithmetic is evil witchcraft.   I don't like the idea of people like that being near any actual power.    ",2016-05-07 07:00:46+00:00,d2w4ybf,2.0,t1_d2w1tzd,8825.0,SubredditDrama
478,"I just remember when my mother was in Hospice.   There were just days left to her life, and the doctors didn't want to prescribe pain medicine stronger than extra strength tylenol because of addiction worries.   That's when I found that there were were Federal agents with an office in the hospital to keep an eye on doctors prescribing opiates.   

It's now basically government policy that old woman with painful cancer need to die in screaming hell pain because we're more worried about addiction than allowing people to die comfortably.  

It was only when I had a fucking shit fit demanding that they do something about my mothers pain that they relented and gave her the morphine she needed.    And then only after I threatened to go to the press.  

It's one thing to worry about people becoming addicts, it's all together something else to require sick people to live in pain hell cause were worried about the wrong things.   They and their own doctors need to be making these decisions.   Federal agents should not be involved in deciding if you need pain relief.

479,"Thank you.  You seem to have said it better than me.   I very much agree with veritasabaequitas's political take on the issue.   Water needs to be a right at some level.   Whether that term is ""human right"", ""basic right"" ""needs met"" or some other semantics..... I am not sure.   

I am very much a left wing liberal/socialist something or other.   Those are all terms that mean different things to different people.   I like the term ""liberal Democrat"" because it was Franklin Roosevelt's preferred label.    

Anyway, the issue the Nestle exec seems to be having is:  If water is a human right, then who is responsible to provide the water?   I'm pretty sure he wants to avoid people just deciding that it's Nestle's responsibility.  Where as others would put the responsibility on the local national governments.  

Broadly speaking, using the US government model, if you declare water a human right....  which level of government is responsible?  In most of our country it seems to be at the municipality  or County level.   In some areas it might be a state responsibility.   But it's not really a Federal level issue, except that sometimes Federal monies are allocated to the state or local government to help provide it.   But the Federal government provides money for roads and train service too, and nobody is declaring highways a base human right.  

And I don't know where it would help anyone to declare it a right at the United Nation level.     I don't know if it really ever becomes the responsibility of somewhere other than the US government to provide water to American citizens.   Likewise, I don't think it becomes the US responsibility to help other countries provide for themselves.    Not that it might not help the US to help other governments around the world from time to time.   

The goal of most of the UN declaring water a human right seems to be more focused on getting the Western nations to provide money to third world governments as some sort of political game.     

And while you can say that the Western colonizers really messed up large parts of the third world,  those local governments still have to provide for their own people.   When colonialism ended, China and India were supposed to both go to total pot because over population was going to destroy them.   And the former African colonies were predicted to do well.   And then the opposite happened.    Anyway, at some point you need to acknowledge that the Western nations level 50-70 years ago.   A lot of the issue is no longer the responsibility of the former Western Imperialists.  

Anyway, my comment here is wandering off on tangents.... but I agree with the urge to want to declare water a human right.   But I am skeptical that such a declaration in and of itself would accomplish anything.   

What third world governments need to be doing is building local infrastructure.   Water treatment plants and plumbing services should be one of those things.   ",2016-05-06 23:56:28+00:00,d2vt6c4,6.0,t1_d2vqz9h,3787.0,skeptic

491,"The bigger issue with Sanders is that he's extremely well liked in Vermont. He won his last Senate race with 71% of the vote.   Which sounds great..... if you want to be the Senator from Vermont.  He has a lot of freedom because of all that support.  He doesn't have to worry about one-issue tanking him with his own electorate.  Even if he turns off some people by a position he takes on something controversial, he will still be above 50% come the next election.  (Unless he's actually doing something truly horrific, like murdering cub scout and eating the corpses).   

Where as a lot of Senators come from states where they have close races.  If you won your race with just 51.5% of the vote, then one miss step with your electorate, and you'll lose the next election.  And what the voters think is a miss-step isn't always really one.   Take an issue like the Death Penalty, Abortion or higher taxes.   Pissing off 4-6% of your supporters...... and that changes the outcome of the next election.   

As such, Sanders doesn't have much to worry about.  Just has to make sure he's not hunting cub scouts in the backwoods of Vermont.  Otherwise, even with a couple of major miss-steps he just wins the next election with only 59% of the vote.   Which is still something that most would consider a landslide.   

Sanders has the freedom to be himself.   A freedom a lot of other Senators and Congressmen don't have.   And then Sanders complains that they are cautious and calculating..... when it's the voters who make the politicians cautious and calculating.

Anyway, Bernie Sanders it the clear second place loser in the primaries.    If Hillary can't accept the nomination, why in the heck would the Super delegates choose Bernie Sanders?

They aren't going to vote for Trump, but they are groups that have a tendency to not-vote when they think they are being ignored. 

Assuming Hillary isn't there, it would be a dumb move for the Democrats to nominate Sanders.    It would be smarter instead going with somebody like Vice President Joe Biden or California Governor Jerry Brown, or former nominees like John Kerry or Al Gore.

527,"&gt; Criminal Justice Reform was praised by lots of black politicians. It wasn't a purposely racist policy. It wasn't the Clinton's trying to sell progressivism down the river, it was at the time a popular program supported by lots of people.

No less a person than Bernie Sanders himself voted in favor of it.  While those who voted against it included Progressive Luminaries like:

* Newt Gingrich
* Rick Santorum
* Denis Hastert
* John Boehner
* Dick Armey
* Tom DeLay
* Strom Thurmond 
* Orin Hatch 
* Jesse Helms 
* Trent Lott 
* Ted Stevens 
* Mitch McConnell

Sometimes you can judge the worth of something just based on the list of those who oppose it.    I think this might be one of those times.  

The way the House and Senate voted on that bill can be found here:

* [House](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1994/roll416.xml)
* [Senate](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00295)

In PD the mod-team removes a lot of comments and threads, and bans a lot of users.    The user base there likes that approach.   For a subreddit of 73K users, [the traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/about/traffic/) is very heavy. 

There are also those who prefer /r/NeutralPolitics, which also is heavily moderated.  

Then there are those who just flee the political subreddits that officially take a side, like /r/Libertarian, /r/socialism, /r/Progressive, /r/Liberal, /r/Conservative, /r/occupywallstreet, etc.  There are the candidate specific subreddits like /r/SandersForPresident, /r/hillaryclinton, /r/Obama, etc.

As a child George Takei lived for over three years in a prison camp built and maintained by the United States government for it's own citizens.   He had fought for more civil rights and gay-rights for years.   They are very important issues to Takei and he is right to worried about what President Trump would do.   

Trump has mentioned the internment of Japanese citizens during WW2 as okay.  It's not a big jump from those comments to assuming he might be okay with doing exactly that to Muslim and Hispanic Americans.  

And the hate and vitriol directed by Sanders supporters at Takei.... that's more than a little low.    Comments about him being a stupid actor....but actors who like Sanders are more than actors, their highly paid business-men and business-woman.  But the minute they say it's time to embrace reality..... well, then the Sanders supporters think it's time to kick them in the groin.

He's an actor, but he's also got a lifetime of experience.   He's not stupid.  He's very much got an opinion worth considering.

626,"Lord, Save Bernie Sanders from his supporters.

Sanders is right about a lot of things.  But he seems to want turn everything up side down over night.   And that's not just how one can get things done.   

If you want take the United States to the left, you can't get in your care and drive across the George Washington bridge and declare yourself in Los Angeles.    First you have to enter New Jersey, and control on across the country..... thru Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, etc.  Eventually entering California after several days worth of driving. 

Sadly, the Sanders campaign supporters seem to think they have found a away to grow Star Trek transporter technology in a field behind an abandoned Burger King.   They paid a guy at the corner for the magic beans and they want to use them right away.    They don't like the idea of compromise and making deals and stuff.   Where as the Founding Fathers gave us a country and government that is based on compromise.    

Hillary Clinton understands that she needs to bring Republicans, Independents, Democrats, Conservatives and Liberals, all along for the ride.  Nobody can really be left behind.   That means working out deals that appease are certain number of people n the short run.   

Clinton isn't going to make crazy pronouncements about getting people to the promised land.   Her plan is to get the country to Ohio, and she is going to be happy to settle for the middle of Pennsylvania if that is what it takes.   Then it will become some new presidents job to get the folks through Indiana, Illinois and maybe Iowa.

It takes time to do things.   Change is hard.  The President can't decide that some parts of the country suck and don't get to come on the journey.  They don't get to just sell Mississippi or Idaho off on eBay.   Presidents are not empowered to trade Montana to Canada in exchange for Prince Edward Island and a backup Defenceman who is also a decent goon.    

Sanders people seem to think they are allowed to ignore parts of the country they don't like. Right away that tells you Sanders doesn't want to be President of all of these United States.

634,"[Norman Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug) supported GMOs.   He saved the lives of billions of people in the [Green Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution).   He was sure that if he had had access to GMO technology back when the Green Revolution was starting, that could have saved millions more.  In his quest to produce pest resistant forms of Corn and Wheat, they needed to produce tens of thousands of manually produced cross breeds.   You have to grow each of those cross breads, determine if they work, and then confirm that they work.  And while corn and wheat grow quickly, they still take weeks to months to grow.  All to find 5-10 individual breeds that met their initial requirements.    Where as he figured that GMO produced strains would have saved his teams years worth of research time.   

And in those years how many millions died of starvation?

Borlaug said a few things that I think are important and which I think address some of your underlying yet unwarranted assumptions.  

---

&gt;I now say that the world has the technology – either available or well advanced in the research pipeline – to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people. The more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology? While the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low-risk positions, and pay more for food produced by the so-called “organic” methods, the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income, food-deficit nations cannot.

--- 

&gt;Some of the environmental lobbyists of the western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are elitists. They have never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels. If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they would be crying out for tractors, and fertilizer, and irrigation canals, and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things.

636,"More information presented in a dumb way doesn't help anyone.  Why not require warning labels on foods picked by minorities?   It's just more info, so by your logic it couldn't possibly harm anyone.   Except it was make minorities appear to be evil because why else would you have the warning label?      

It's the [Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide campaign](http://www.dhmo.org/facts.html) writ large. Tell people some select facts about how Dihydrogen Monoxide is involved in a lot bad stuff, like it being a colorless and odorless chemical compound has been involved in every drowning in human history. Add in 20 or 30 other so-called problems with this oh so evil chemical.  For example, it's been a major component in every drowning ever.   All while leaving out the basic fact that Dihydrogen Monoxide is just a chemical name for *Water*.   

Don't take my word for it, take it from [Norman Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug). He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for saving the lives of over a billion people from starvation. Mexico, India, and Pakistan today are food net exporters directly because of his work. For several years he was the only person allowed to directly travel between India and Pakistan without prior approval from both governments. China then copied his work to help feed themselves.  In 1970 Borlaug was credited with having saved the lives of over a billion people.  Today that number would be in the neighborhood of three billion.  

I'm sorry, but GMOs don't need to be labeled. They are safe. Demanding that they be labeled is the same as demanding labels on all meat sold at your supermarket that everything there is human flesh free.   It would scare the shit out of people if every package of hamburger was labeled ""We 100% guarantee that none of this hamburger is secretly ground up human flesh"". Nobody would buy it.   People would assume the warning label was there for a legitimate reason.  

Labeling GMO's is nothing more than a backdoor attempt at a ban.   A ban the courts would probably strike down.   It's a way of making something totally safe appear to be unsafe. 

Anyone who wants GMO labels on food should also demand that everything be labeled as ""Human Flesh Free"" at the supermarket. Even the light bulbs and AAA batteries in the little electronics area in the middle of the store. Otherwise, how are you going to know that the the Light Bulb isn't made from human flesh?

GMO's are 100% safe and even natural.  Demonizing science is always bad.  ",2016-04-20 08:52:25+00:00,d2a3ey1,3.0,t1_d29ypig,13618.0,PoliticalDiscussion

642,"That kind of talk scares the hell out of me.  

The times when there are four or five contenders running for the White House were always very trying times for the United States.   In 1860 there was five candidates.  When Lincoln won, that was considered casus belli by the Southern States.   In 1912 there was just three major candidates, and all hell almost broke lose then. 

And if the House has to make a determination as to who won..... What happens if the current House declares a Republican Winner and then after a new House is seated, they declare a Democrat or Third Party candidate the winner?   Does the Supreme Court even have grounds to intervene in that conflict?  

In 1876 a Extra-Constitutional Election Commission was created to determine a winner.  And there were only two candidates that year.   I think we're beyond the point were anyone would agree with an Extra-Constitutional measure could be adopted.  

Talk of 5-canidate general elections is crazy talk.   Nobody should want that.

658,"The only reason the flawed but workable Obamacare exists is because the Democrats controlled Congress during the time period it was passed. If the President doesn't have support from Congress, it won't matter what said President wold want to do. 

In his autobiography, Tip O'Neill contrasted Carter and Reagan as President.   Carter was a democrat who didn't the support of his own party.  Reagan was a Republican who faced a Democratic controlled Congress.  

Carter believed his ""Outsider"" label to a fault.  He refused to do things like have private lunches and dinners with Congressman and Senators.   He refused to ask people for their votes.  Where as Reagan was more than happy to invite people who politically hated him to break bread and then politely ask them for their vote.  Which, yes.... a good number of Democrats then said no to Reagan.   But he asked anyway, and people like to be asked.  Even when they then politely decline.  Middle of the Road Democrats often ended up voting with Reagan because he gave them attention.   When Congressman went back to their districts they liked being able to truthfully say ""I was talking to the President just the other day"". 

In short, Reagan was willing to stoke egos and Carter wasn't.    That's something a President needs to do.   

Another example is LBJ.  LBJ was able to simultaneously threaten political careers and sweet talk people like probably no other President in American history.   Barry Goldwater's views on the 1964 Civil Right act were well known.  More so, Goldwate'rs personal dislike of LBJ was well known even to LBJ.  At the last minute, LBJ still called and spoke to him for an hour+ to ask Goldwater for his vote.  Goldwater said LBJ almost got him to vote for it.   LBJ knew he already had to the votes for the win, but still he took the time to ask a person he assuredly knew would decline.   

People love it when their President asks them for help.  

I have a hard time envisioning Bernie Sanders taking large amounts of his time asking people he *knows* will say no for their support.   But it's not optional..... it's a requirement for a President.  

I'm sure Hillary Clinton knows these things.   She won't like doing it, but she'll invite Ted Cruz and James Inhofe to the White House for dinner and to ask for their votes on things.

695,"&gt; I think his presidency would probably be disastrous. But not certainly; Trump is a glory hound beholden to no one, so I can see him governing as a moderate if he decides that would bring him most glory. Therefore, he is still preferable over a rigid ideologue like Cruz.

See, I'm a very left wing guy and that exactly the reason I prefer Cruz to Trump.   Trump will base his actions on what he thinks, in any single moment, will bring him the most glory.  And if that action means going Full Hitler, he won't hesitate or back off from it.   

A Cruz Presidency, while disastrous, will be a predictable administration.   We'll be able to plan our future based on what we know of him.   Trump will change his mind based on flights of fancy in his head that day or minute.    Look at his several positions on abortion a week or so ago?   Now imagine instead he's constantly changing his mind after telling Putin or Xi Jinping something he was going to do?  Trump has a history of changing his mind and position.  Would or should any World Leader trust anything he says for more than five minutes?  

That could easily lead to very dangerous situations.   If Trump then thinks he'll look like a hero for winning a nuclear war..... what the fuck happens then?    He won't care about the billions of dead bodies.  He'll care more that the newspaper or history book praises the great leader.  

And so that scares the shit out of me.   Cruz is more predictable.     I pretty much know the scary shit he'll do.   Trump will dream up new scary stuff though.  A terrifyingly known crazy Cruz is vastly preferable to the unknown scary Trump.

That's a point Norman Borlaug himself refuted.   Borlaug made the point that in his quest to produce pest resistant forms of Corn and Wheat, they needed to produce tens of thousands of manual produced cross breeds.   You have to grow each of those cross breads, determine if they work, and then confirm that they work.  And while corn and wheat grow quickly, they still take weeks to months to grow.  All to find 5-10 individual breeds that met their initial requirements.    Where as he figured that GMO produced strains would have saved his teams years worth of research time.   

And in those years how many millions died of starvation?

Borlaug said a few things that I think are important and which I think address some of your underlying yet unwarranted assumptions.

This story was previously submitted to /r/Skeptic: [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/4elaj4/gmo_food_labels_are_meaningless/).   At /r/Biology today is [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/4emxsd/what_makes_gmos_such_a_controversial_topic/).    Both threads are interesting and worth checking out.  

The biggest problem is the GMO's are 100% safe and even natural. It's the [Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide campaign](http://www.dhmo.org/facts.html) writ large. Tell people some select facts about how Dihydrogen Monoxide is involved in a lot bad stuff, like it being a colorless and odorless chemical compound has been involved in every drowning in human history. Add in 20 or 30 other so-called problems with this oh so evil chemical.  For example, it's been a major component in every drowning ever.   All while leaving out the basic fact that Dihydrogen Monoxide is just a chemical name for *Water*.   

Don't take my word for it, take it from [Norman Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug). He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for saving the lives of over a billion people from starvation. Mexico, India, and Pakistan today are food net exporters directly because of his work. For several years he was the only person allowed to directly travel between India and Pakistan without prior approval from both governments. China then copied his work to help feed themselves.  In 1970 Borlaug was credited with having saved the lives of over a billion people.  Today that number would be in the neighborhood of three billion.  

I'm sorry, but GMOs don't need to be labeled. They are safe. Demanding that they be labeled is the same as demanding labels on all meat sold at your supermarket that everything there is human flesh free.   It would scare the shit out of people if every package of hamburger was labeled ""We 100% guarantee that none of this hamburger is secretly ground up human flesh"". Nobody would buy it.   People would assume the warning label was there for a legitimate reason.  

Labeling GMO's is nothing more than a backdoor attempt at a ban.   A ban the courts would probaly strike down.   It's a way of making something totally safe appear to be unsafe.

She will get over 900 delegates out of those three states, adding them to the 1758 delegates already hers.   Which guarantees her well above the ~2400 needs to the nomination regardless of what happens with any other primary.

So we don't have to worry about Sanders getting the Democratic nomination.  It just straight up can't and won't happen.

715,"That right there is the reason I actively refuse to vote for Sanders.  His supporters lack the basic understanding of reality and that makes me think the same must be true for him.  If I was running for office and had supporters who were totally wrong, I would denounce them.  Instead Sanders seems willing to take that dumb support.   

We have been down that road before.  In 2000 a lot of Democrats didn't get out and vote for Gore because he didn't seem exciting enough.   So we got Bush.  I had Democratic friends tell me that people wouldn't let Bush do anything and that in 2004 he would turned out of office.  Instead 9/11 happened and we got the Iraq war, and then a destroyed economy.    

Now we have people wanting to blame Hillary Clinton for the Iraq war, when 78 Senators voted for the Iraq War resolution, and EVERY member who voted against the Iraq War resolution who is still in the Senate has endorsed Hillary Clinton.   Not one of them has endorsed Sanders.   Because they know something about foreign policy.   Sanders tells everyone how he would have voted..... but the people who voted that way back then can't bring themselves to support Sanders.  

Clinton acknowledges she made a mistake in voting for the war resolution.  But the very people who think it was a mistake seem to want to insist that she double down on the wrong decision.   A politician changes their mind for perfectly good and logical reasons, and they can't handle it.    

I want a President that is capable of changing their mind on issues when they see new data.    Only idiots insist that a politician double down on stupid.   Idiots like that are the reason so many politicians do double down on stupid.  

Sanders comes off way too much like W. Bush too me.   At the end of the W. Bush administration he was asked the started question.  Is there anything would change about your Presidency?   Every President previous to him always had something they would have done different.  FDR, Truman, Eisenhower, LBJ, Nixon, Reagan, Bush Sr, Clinton, etc.   W. Bush said he did everything perfectly and wouldn't change anything.    Sanders says the same basic thing about his time in Congress..... that he always made the right decision and voted the right way.    Which I am just going to say is obviously impossible.  Everyone makes mistakes.  Only idiots refuse to accept that.   Yet W. Bush and Sanders both insist they are mistake free.     I don't buy that.  Period.  

In 2000 Gore made mistakes.  But so did the electorate.  They should have elected Gore in spite of his mistakes (He didn't let Clinton get out and campaign for him until there was only three weeks left in the general election).  W. Bush was a very bad President.   

Also, this country will not survive if Trump or Cruz is elected.    Trump, I am 100000% positive, will start a nuclear war and go down in history as worse than Hitler, Stalin and Mao combined.    Cruz will only be a little better in that he'll just slaughter millions of people instead of Trumps billions.    The people who enable that will need to accept their responsibility in the process. 

if Trump wins the White House, I would active support a quick military coup where the Joint Chiefs murder Trump, dissolve the cabinet and congress and assume direct control of the government.  A military Junta would then be the best outcome because Trump would be more than a thousand times worse.  ",2016-04-13 08:08:53+00:00,d20x24d,8.0,t1_d20edit,36085.0,Liberal

729,"Well, New York, Pennsylvania, and California are  going to be giant wins for Hillary Clinton.  And just those three primaries are more than going to give her required delegates for the nomination.  

We know who is going to win which of the remaining states by looking at past history:

* [2008 Democratic Primary Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Democratic_presidential_primary,_2008.svg)
* [2016 Democratic Primary Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries_results,_2016.svg)

Hillary Clinton changed one major thing about her approach to the primaries.  She noted how Obama defeated her in 2008 and went after the Southern states that then supported Obama.  She flipped them to her.   The rest of the map is mostly the same, with the only semi-major difference being at Michigan.    With only New Hampshire and Oklahoma being only other differences.   And NH was expected, it being right next door to Vermont. 

And like I said, NY, PA and CA are all Clinton needs to win.   So we don't even have to worry about New Jersey, Indiana, New Mexico, Kentucky or West Virginia.  Which are states Clinton will most like win as well.   And Maryland is looking like it might change over from 2008, and vote for Clinton as well.  

Really, at this point Clinton will end up with ~2700 delegates if all she wins is NY, PA and CA.   Add in the other major states she won last time, and ~3200 delegates looks like a reasonable final number.  

For those keeping score at home, that's ~1000 more delegates than Obama garnered in 2008.  And we now properly address Obama as Mr. President. ",2016-04-11 20:23:27+00:00,d1ywjkk,2.0,t1_d1yg7qi,21922.0,democrats

I'm a left-wing Liberal Progressive who borders on being a socialist.  I watched [the whole statement Bill Clinton made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW5T4JHZJfU).

Yet there are people out here screaming like Bill Clinton went off on some racist expletive filled rant.

The opinion piece is not from some random blog site or some political site with a major axe to grind (be that a conservative site such as Breitbart or a liberal one akin to Think Progress). 

As such, it has made it through at least a few layers of editorial review.   That's totally not on the same level as peer review, as an academic or scientific paper would be, but that probably does make it an opinion to be aware of.

Jefferson was only elected on the 36th ballot too.  Think about that, the guy who was clearly the Presidential candidate couldn't muster the win for days because Congress was filled with assholes.  And only after Hamilton and Adams had weighted into the fight.... when they finally decided that they hated Aaron Burr a little more than they hated the guy who wrote the Declaration of Independence. 

And I'm not lightly throwing around the tern ""Hate"" here either.    Hamilton and Adams hated Thomas Jefferson.  So imagine what they thought of Aaron Burr.   That actually lead to Burr killing Hamilton four years later.    

The founding fathers were an abusive family with one another.  After they got rid of the English, they turned on each other.

The political map of 2008 vs. 2016 are what to compare:

* [Democratic Primaries 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Democratic_presidential_primary,_2008.svg) 
* [Democratic Primaries 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries_results,_2016.svg)

Clinton went after the Southern States Obama won in 2008.  She learned from that mistake she made then.   Combine the South with the states she won in 2008, and that guarantees her the win.  Even with the minor stumble in Michigan.  The only other difference between then and now, so far, is New Hampshire.  Bernie Sanders is from Vermont, right next door to NH...... so that anomaly is adequately explained.    

I wish Sanders would take a private meeting with Clinton and talk turkey.   I think he would make a great Secretary of Commerce.    A position he could use to work toward regulating the big banks.     He could also maybe ask for Robert Reich to return as Labor Secretary again, which would be something else myself and 90% of the rest oft the Democratic Party would easily support.  

Sanders fought the good fight.  It's over.  Time to beat the Republicans and make sure the country is governed responsibly.

But at the same time it opens a party up to interference from those who don't actually identify with them, and instead want to cause trouble.   

I would argue that the out sized reliance of the primary system itself is the root problem.

When it became clear that Obama had defeated Hillary Clinton for the nomination she immediately ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.  That was a very close primary season, and that didn't happen until early June, 2008.    Obama got about ~2300 delegates to Clinton's ~2000 then.    

Then at the convention Hillary insisted that all the delegates pledged to her should vote for Obama.    Party unity matters to people who want to win general elections.   

Obama is probably the best individual President ever elected by the modern Primary System.    That said, I wouldn't mind getting rid of the whole primary system.  In 1960 there was SEVEN primaries, not 56.

What happened?   The Nazis built a private army that was larger than the Reichswehr.    They then used that private Army, including the SA and SS, to intimidate and drive all non-Nazis from the political sphere, force them into deals with the Nazis that entailed some becoming Nazis.   The message was generally clear to the German people, they had to become Nazis or else. 

The Nazis took over Germany because the whole ridicule an ignore methods free-speech upholders want to use..... that route failed.   And millions of people died.  11 million were murdered in the Holocaust.   But 70+ million died in the war.  

The Free Speech route only works if your opponent also wants to use it.   If they build a private Army, and refuse to engage in reasoned rational discourse, then the only way to stop them is force.   By the time the German people figured out the Nazis game plan, the Nazis were in total control of the German government.  

In short, Germany has some experience with the limits of the power of free speech.   People need to note that only the United States goes for the whole ""Free Speech, even for actual murderous Nazis"" route.

That law only would exist so some anti-abortion lawyer working for the DA (NOT a doctor) can look into why some woman and doctor made the decision to abort a child at the last minute.  99.99999% of the time it would have been a heart wrenching decision made for good reasons, and he comes an giant asshole NOT-A-DOCTOR who turns their lives upside down in order to mindlessly crusade against abortion.  

The NOT-A-DOCTOR has no right to any medical opinion about anything.   It's not their body either.   So they have no right to an opinion about another persons private medical decisions.  In short, no right to an opinion at all in the matter.  Period.  End of discussion.

819,"A good part of it is that the back-to-Africa social movements among African Americans start largely in the 19th and early 20th centuries.   At a time when what Europeans largely knew about African history was Egypt and a bit about East Africa cause it interacted with Egypt and the Middle East.  

Other than knowing of Sub-Saharan Africa's existence, Europeans largely didn't know much about the people or societies that were there.   They knew some general facts, some of which they got wrong..... and not much else.   Remember, the Europeans dominated Africa for a few hundred years, but never really organized their territories there until rather late.  For example, Nigeria was only organized into a formal Colony in 1914.  

That which was accurately known were lists of products you could acquire there to be shipped out.   Some Brits and other Europeans took interest in the people and their history, but they were not numerous.  And a lot of it was viewed from a frame work that they understood European history through..... and some of those general paradigms don't apply as well when used with non-European histories.    And then there were lots of old rumors (a lot of it probably actual fiction) about Africa that some Europeans kept looking for there.  For example:  [Prester John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prester_John).   Stuff they were almost sure existed somewhere in Africa, that some people wasted lifetimes trying to find.   African versions of the El Dorado myth in the Americas. 

It doesn't help that this same general time period also saw a lot of wide spreed interest in things like Atlantis and Lemuria, etc.  With various crack pots writing ""histories"" of those myths.  And the Atlantis people looked at Egypt as weird survivors of the biblical flood who rebuilt civiilization and stuff.....  which allowed some of that to distort pictures of what people thought they understood.

Some people might be mad at whoever runs as a Third Party, but McCain is older and probably near retiring from the Senate.   He could take the heat and maybe accept the role taking a big political hit in order to keep long term damage from killing the Republican party.  

I'm not a Republican, but it's got some good history that I hope doesn't end up totally shit canned.   Once upon a time, it was The Party of Lincoln. ",2016-03-27 04:01:21+00:00,d1ex4y4,7.0,t1_d1ec4jk,37746.0,SubredditDrama

933,"If any candidate has the majority of the delegates going into the convention, then they can't be denied the nomination.   Please remember, a plurality is not a majority.   Even then, still the last time a candidate who had a Plurality of the delegates going into their party convention, then lost the nomination was in 1920.  

The last time there was a convention that went beyond one round of balloting was 1952 for the Democrats and 1948 for the Republicans.  

The primary process is something that came into use ad hoc.  They were used as one-off experiments for potential Presidential  candidates to prove they could win something not their home state.    In 1960 there were seven primary elections before the Conventions.  JFK broke with all previous political tradition and entered all seven of them.   That was became he was a Catholic and had to prove he could win elections in majority protestant states before anyone was comfortable giving him the Democratic nomination.  Many blamed the 1928 Democratic loss on Al Smith being Catholic.  

After that, more states created primaries.  In 1968 there was 13 primaries.  That primary season went nuts, mostly because Eugene McCarthy attracted a good amount of support, but scared the shit out of the Democratic Establishment.  And RFK was assassinated.   Humphrey then went to the convention, where LBJ gave him the party nomination.   Humphrey was the sitting Vice President, but he didn't enter any of the primaries that year.  Most likely, Kennedy was going to be the nominee until he was killed.  As such, everything went nuts and the convention went crazy.  But Humphrey still easily won the nomination on the first ballot.  

The primary process is now how we choose the party nominees.   Anyone who goes into the Conventions with anything more than a good heavy plurality will be given the party nomination.    Party elders and political donors may withhold political support afterward, but at that point they won't deny them the nomination.   

The issue will be over what constitutes a ""good heavy plurality"".  If Trump goes to the GOP convention with 1200+ delegates, but a few short of 1237..... nobody will be able to deny him the nomination.  I doubt they would be able to deny him the nomination if he has more than 1000 delegates.   Does ""good heavy plurality"" stop existing below a number like 1000..... at some point, probably.   The 739 he has now ain't it.   But the four digit nature of 1000 probably makes it the psychological threshold required to be awarded the nomination without a real fight.  

Short of that, and there most likely will be a major political fight.  That said, I doubt the Republicans would end up denying him the nomination even in that case.   It's been almost a century since the leading contender was denied the nomination.  In 1964 everyone knew Goldwater was going to lose the general election in a landslide.  The GOP still gave Goldwater the nomination though.   They didn't have to worry about pledged delegates breaking their word either.  Leading candidates are just not denied their parties nomination...... if only because they are the ones with proven levels, however small, of some actual support.     Hypotheticals make for entertaining discussion, but nobody wants to engage in them during a general election.

The Clinton campaign said that in order to get health care passed the mandate would need to be baked into the law.   Obama denied it.  Obama won the primaries and got the nomination.  Obamacare then contained the very mandate that the Obama campaign claimed it wouldn't have.   Clinton was up front about what was needed to be part of the law.  Obama came to understand that and put it there himself.   

Sanders wants medicare for all.  And that's great, except that it's not going to be possible for a generation.   Everyone, including Sanders, acknowledges that Congress (both the House and Senate) are still going to be controlled by the Republicans when the next President takes office.   Hillary Clinton wants to add another 10-15 million people to the Obama care rolls.   Which is going to be difficult if not impossible to get from a Republican Congress.   But medicare for all...... not only won't it happen, we'd all be extremely lucky if Congress doesn't impeach Sanders just for suggesting it.

The facts show Hillary Clinton has received twice the primary popular vote of Bernie Sanders so far.      In 2008 Clinton got more of the popular vote than did Obama.   This year she is blowing out Sanders.  She's gotten over 8 million votes for far, compared to Sanders 3.5 mllion.   

She also has a big lead in delegates.    She is going to win the primaries in each New York, Pennsylvania and California.   She already has 1680 delegates.   Those three states alone are going to give her roughly another 900 delegates.  She only needs ~2400 for the nomination.

When you get down to the specific problems answers are going to be all over the map.

Those people will mention that the best US Presidents, such as Lincoln and FDR, were chosen that way.  

Others will want to ""Fix"" the primary system and eliminate the remaining party boss element entirely. 

Others will blame weird stuff that makes no sense, like the colors used in the US flag.  You're thinking that would be insane, but you forget that a large number of people are weirdos.   

Others will want to bring in total public funding of political campaigns.  Others will want to eliminate what little public funding we do now. 

Some others will want to get rid of the electoral college system.  Others will want to set Florida afloat in the Caribbean and then conveniently forget it ever existed.  Others will want to refight the Civil War and move the capital to Richmond.

Later, at the Democratic Convention it was Hillary that called for Obama's nomination by acclimation.  

She held out and ran a long campaign.  She ended up with almost 2000 delegates to Obama a little over 2300.   But she lost.   She accepted that reality.  She didn't run around screaming about how Obama was unfair or anything.

Obama then rewarded that when he nominated her as Secretary of State.   He's all but endorsed her in this primary season.  The only reason he hasn't actually formally endorsed her is the long tradition against a sitting Presidents doing that before the party Convention.

1005,"I admit a lot of what I am saying is very far fetched.  I just want it to stay in the realm of fantasy.    Cause when one starts to look at the gaps in how our government works..... one can get worried.   Military Coups are standard in many parts of the world.   Many countries go from Military Coup to Military Coup and never do any actual elections or what we think of as regular governing.  It's all crisis after crisis after crisis.  And those countries do very poorly economically because nobody invests their money in places like those.   The risk is just too great.    

I think I saw a documentary about the Truman library stuff around the firing of Douglas MacArthur.   Yes, Truman has support of Marshall, Acheson, and others.   Still don't want to contemplate MacArthur resisting.   Maybe he just gets pushed into an Airplane and forcibly shipped home.   Maybe he brings his Army home from Korea with him.   The later just is horrific at best.  

As to Pétain..... the whole history about his later years as a Nazi flunky.....  really bad.  His arrest, imprisonment and then all the weird stuff about his body and the laying of wreaths and stuff is all very perplexing to me.    I read that stuff and I just get lost.

1007,"She didn't concede until Obama had won.  She actually got more popular votes than did Obama in the Democratic Primaries in 2008.  But Obama won the majority of the delegates 33 states vs. 23 for Hillary Clinton.   (There are more primaries than there are states).

As to the Health care proposals of 2008 Obama and Clinton..... , the thing Obama refused to acknowledge in 2008 was that a mandate would need to be written into the law.   Clinton said a mandate would be required to get a health-care law passed.   And what did Obamacare contain when Obama signed it?   The very mandate Campaign Obama claimed wasn't needed.  

Sanders is done.   There is no possible path for him to get the Democratic nomination.   Clinton has mortal locks on the NY, PA and CA primaries.   They are not coincidentally the three largest delegate prizes remaining.    Even if she loses all other primaries by 100% of the vote., those three states alone will give her to delegate strength to guarantee her he nomination.

1008,"Right before the Civil War James Longstreet warned that if the war went on for more than four years, that the American people (both North and South) may begin to look for dictators to take over.    It never came to pass then, but probably only because the war started go come to a close.   After Lincoln won reelection, and Grant and Sherman continued to rack up victory after victory..... the South started to contract in itself and the war came to a close at Appomattox.  

Also, the Military ranking system in the US is odd.  The first Four-Star General in US History was US Grant.  He was only promoted to that rank in 1866, after the Civil War was over.   Sherman and Sheridan successively succeed to the command of the Army, and each of them also got a fourth star.  But each of them was a certified military hero of the Civil War.    And it was one 4-star at a time then.   

The US Military then stopped using the 4-star General rank for a generation.  Next it was used three times during World War I.  When US Army Chief's of Staff Bliss and March received it, as well commander of the US Expeditionary Forces, John Pershing. 

Pershing then was promoted to the Rank of General of the Armies.  Which there is some debate about.  At the time it was considered a special type of 4-star Rank.   Pershing designed his own rank-insignia, which was Four Gold Stars.  The normal 4-star rank insignia being Four Silver Stars. 

Then after the several World War Two guys were all promoted to the newly created Five-Star Rank, Pershing still assumed himself to be their senior. Of course, it was then only ceremonial seniority, as Pershing was then very old and long retired.   The WW2 guys looked up to Pershing as the old war horse.  So why not let him think he was senior to them?  It didn't hurt anyone.    

Now a lot of people assume Pershing to be the only person to have served as 6-star General in US History (setting aside Washington, as he only was promoted to the 6-star rank in 1976, long after his death).  Mostly because the 5-star rank is called General of the Army, and Pershing's title was General of the Armies.   

After WWI, they again tried to stop using the four-star rank.  But only a decade went by, and they were using it again.   When the rank was again used by whoever was the sitting US Army Chief of Staff.    So MacArthur was the 8th 4-star General in US History.  Marshall was the 10th.  Eisenhower then was the 11th person to obtain the rank, in 1943.  We're well into WW2 there.     At the close of WW2, another 15 generals would be promoted to the 4-star rank.   

After that, it really starts to proliferate.     At the close of WW2, the US had 25 4-stars. Now the US Army alone has promoted 215 people to the 4-star rank.  

* [US Army 4-Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Army_four-star_generals): 215
* [US Air force 4-Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Air_Force_four-star_generals): 205
* [US Navy 4-Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Navy_four-star_admirals): 221
* [US Marine 4-Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Marine_Corps_four-star_generals): 49

That's a lot of brass. 

Anyway, these guys do have forced retirement ages and stuff, but I don't think any of that is the primary stopper of coups.   The forced retirement is because of how the promotion system works.  If somebody has been around and not messed up, he is expected to be promoted.   But they need have a command, and the number of commands that exist is set in legislation as a hard number.    So there is a complicated game of musical chairs happening so as to not impede the upward career advancement of the lower ranked officers.    If a 4-star ranked officer finds himself without a command, he's forced to retire after 60 days.... unless, as you pointed out, he can get a wavier from the Secretary of Defense or the President.    But the Sec Def and President normally only use those upon on the advice of the Joint Chiefs.   President Clinton was pissed when Wesley Clark was passed over by the Army for a command and forced into early retirement.  He could have granted Clark a wavier, but the Chiefs were really against it and so Clinton didn't grant it.   The Chiefs recommendation isn't required, but most Presidents are super loath to overrule them on things like that.  

MacArthur's issues with Truman were kind of an out of time thing.    MacArthur didn't get that something major had changed.   The White House and the President could easily communicate their orders quickly to him in Japan and Korea.    So the President did what Presidents do, and gave orders.  MacArthur thought Korea and Japan were his to command, because the President had given him those responsibilities.   He thought that meant he would not be interfered with by them.     It didn't help that MacArthur was issuing threats to the Chinese and escalating the Korean War in ways the White House didn't want.

Truman fired MacArthur because MacArthur started to toy with the idea of not obeying the President.   Or at least giving that impression.  But remember how many people hated Truman for that.   His approval rating sank to single digits.    MacArthur though (thankfully) accepted that he'd been fired.  He understood that Truman still had that power.    He went home to Address a Joint session of Congress, got a ticker tape parade in NY City.    There was some talk of impeaching Truman for a little while, though that obviously went no where in the end.  

All that said, imagine if MacArthur had been even more headstrong.  What if he'd openly denied that the President had the power to fire him?   He had been ruling Japan as if he was an Imperial Consul.   He had Five Stars.  He was loved by the American people.   Thankfully we didn't have to find out what might have happened in that scenario.    

Nothing of that nature has ever happened in American history.   That said, what happens if the Joint Chiefs are meeting and they all decide that the President (or Congress or the government) itself needs to go?    They go into a meeting with he President, and they murder the President.     It's a terrifying thought to contemplate.   It's happened in a lot other countries.     

You can bring up factors like what would the Vice President, Congress, the Cabinet, the Security Council, Secret Service, FBI, CIA, NSA, etc.  each do in response.  But really, in such a world where the Joint Chiefs is contemplating murdering the President, I wouldn't want to make assumptions on what those other people and organizations might do.   What they should do might be **very different** from what they would actually do.  

It doesn't happen in the United States largely because nobody anywhere in our governmental system considers it an actual possibility.  The Generals themselves reject the very notion.    

The last time there was a Coup in a major Western Nation was France in 1958, when the French Military demanded that de Gaulle be made head of State.    De Gaulle then legitimated the Coup via a new French Constitution and some elections that were designed expressly for him to win.  And then, in part to placate those who didn't like the Coup..... de Gaulle supported Algerian Independence, which was the very thing the French military had been against when they initiated the Coup.      They tried another anti-de Gaulle coup then a few years later but de Gaulle basically just told them to get bent as by then he'd consolidated his power.  

In historic terms, 1958 isn't all that long ago.    A lot of nations have coups all the time.  Egypt seems to have more Coups than elections.  I know it's a tautology, but it seems to me that it's unthinkable here only because it's been unthinkable for so long.   Break that collective delusion, and a whole Pandora's box of horrors may well follow.

The people who say they will vote for Trump if Clinton gets the Democratic nomination strike me as more than spoiled brats.   Clinton and Sanders agree on 93% of the issues.   So these Sanders supporters would rather flush the entire country down the tube instead of voting for somebody who agrees with them on 93% of the issues.  While Trump is a racist idiot who will use torture and not worry about legality of it.    They will burn the entire country down cause of a few things they lost an argument about.  Clinton is getting more votes than Sanders in the primaries.  In short, they are childish people who seem willing to flush Democratic values down the toilet because others disagreed with them. 

I don't want irrational people like that anywhere near actual power.  As such, I think Clinton is the better choice.   

Especially when you reflect on how she acted after she lost in 2008.  When she lost, she didn't just end her campaign, she also immediately endorsed Obama.  And then when some Clinton supporters then talked about voting for McCain over Obama cause Hillary Clinton lost the primaries...... Hillary Clinton without delay went straight to those people and told them to shut up and get behind Obama.     She was an adult in 2008.

They grew up Republicans and stayed Republicans their entire lives.   The African Americans only started to dabble in voting for Democrats in the 1930s, when they voted for FDR because the entire country fell apart.  But after FDR they mostly returned to voting for Republicans, especially Eisenhower.   It was the Civil Rights legislation that that was delivered by JFK and then LBJ that cemented them becoming Democrats.  

The major issue is hat African Americans think Republicans hate blacks.  That's largely because of the [Southern strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) which epublicans have been using for the last ~50 years.   Which is really driven home by this quote of Lee Atwater:

&gt;You start out in 1954 by saying, ""Nigger, nigger, nigger."" By 1968 you can't say ""nigger"" — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me — because obviously sitting around saying, ""We want to cut this,"" is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ""Nigger, nigger.""

As such, African Americans ran away from voting for the Republicans.    Republicans made a political calculation in the 1960s that they would rather have nearly all of the racist white vote than a little less than half of the African American vote. 

Congressman Jack Kemp always did pretty good at attracting African American vote.   He normally got about 40% of the African American vote in his district.  Mostly because he went to them and genuinely asked for their votes.    Of course Kemp also liked to tell jokes about why he was unpopular on the national Republican stage was because he'd often hung out with a lot of naked black men.  (In case anyone needs to know, Kemp played Football for both the San Deign Chargers and the Buffalo Bills, winning two AFL championships).  

If the Republicans tried..... they could convince a lot of pro-life, very religious Christian African Americans to vote for them.   They could attract about 40% of the African American vote if they wanted too.  But the Republicans think they would lose more votes from White racists than they would gain from Religious African Americans.   So the Republicans don't try for it.

1043,"[List of the Super delegates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Democratic_Party_superdelegates,_2016).    You notice something when you look at the list.  Largely they are people who are currently elected office holders (For Example,  President Barak Obama is a super delegate), or they are Party members who used to be Office Holders (For example, Former President Jimmy Carter).  

Super delegates are a hold over from the past before the modern Primary System came into existence.   In 1960 JFK broke with all previous tradition in Presidential Politics and entered all SEVEN primaries that year.  He had to demonstrate that get could win elections in states without majority Catholic populations.   Before 1960 Presidential Candidates would traditionally only enter one or two primaries, and then only to show they could win an election outside their home state.  Now there are 56 primaries.  

Also, Super delegates have never changed the outcome of a Democratic Convention.  

In 2008 David Axelrod's (the architect of Obama's 2008 campaign for President) told then Senator Obama ""If you win the primaries, the Super delegates will come home to you at the Convention. But if you don't win the primaries it doesn't matter if they come home to you"".

Super delegates are a hold over from the past.  People write about them every election cycle because they are sort of an interesting thing to write about.   But really, at the end of the day these stories are the political equivalent of hearing distant galloping hoof beats and instead of attributing it to horses, one immediately believes a heard of Zebra's or Unicorns are coming over the hill.

1066,"Correct.  Never in the history of the Democratic Party have the majority super delegates have never not supported the eventual winner the nomination.   Never have they, as a group, voted for somebody who didn't already have the nomination via regularly elected delegates. 

This fear of Super delegates is plain irrational.  Who are Super Delegates?  They are already elected officials in the various states, including Congressmen, Senatorss, Governors, mayors of large cities, former Presidents, etc.   As a Current or Former President, Barak Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter are each Super delegates in the Democratic Party.   Sitting Democratic Governors are Super Delegates.  Sitting US Congressman and Senates are Super delegates.  They have each won elections to office already.   

[List of the Current Democrat Super Delegates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Democratic_Party_superdelegates,_2016). 

All Super Delegates are basically is a throw back to the old system that used to be used to select presidential candidates.   The Primaries and Caucuses were one time very rare.   For example, in 1960 JFK broke with all previous tradition in Presidential Politics and entered ALL SEVEN primaries that year.   Now we have 56 Primaries and Caucuses in the United States (50 states, and six territories).   In the old days Primaries were basically a one-off so a candidate could prove some people would vote for him.  Candidates were expected to enter one or two primaries to prove that they could gain some real support.   JFK was Catholic and had to prove he could win multiple states that lacked Catholic Majorities to calm the fears of his party leadership in 1960.    

Now the Primary System is the de facto the entire game.  

The only reason Super delegates are retained is because (1) in the end they don't matter and (2) it makes some people feel important.    And, in the crazy event something crazy does happen and nobody wins the elected delegates (which won't happen), it does offer a bit of a fall back position. 

But there has not been a truly brokered Democratic Convention since 1952.    The GOP have not had one since 1948.   And in both those cases, they were minor issues and each of them went to three rounds of voting.   The last time either party did more three rounds of voting was 1928 for the Democrats and 1920 for the Republicans.   And the last time the front runner didn't get the party nomination going into the Convention was the 1920 Republican Convention.  

People worrying about Super delegates because of some weird ass technical possibilities that aren't going to happen is tantamount to me worrying about being maybe struck by lightening 10 times in next 10 minutes.  Sure, it's possible.....  but it's so unlikely that I don't worry about.   I simply have better things to do with my time. ",2016-03-20 19:43:52+00:00,d170mt3,9.0,t1_d16zny1,1653.0,politics

1078,"&gt; exclusively 

I never said that it was exclusively Egyptian or Arab.  Just that it was largely populated by Egyptians and Arabs.   I'm sure some Romans from Rome were involved, but it was mostly Egyptian and Arab subjects of the Roman Empire that were involved.  

This belief you have the because Rome made Egypt into a province that immediately the Egyptians were no longer the majority of the population of their own country is, at best, flawed.   ",2016-03-15 19:43:07+00:00,d10zz3d,6.0,t1_d10z2qn,1199.0,worldnews
1079,"Those vessels you are calling Roman were then technically Roman.  But a better way to describe them would be as Egyptians or Arabs who happened to be subjects of the Roman Empire.   In the main, they weren't Romans from Rome.    

Then those Egyptian Romans who traded with India, also had major links with the normal Mediterranean trade routes, probably via Alexandria.   

Roman Egypt and Roman Arabia (The province) were both very conveniently located within the Empire to have trade access to both the Mediterranean and Red Seas.  So yes, traders in both would have taken advantage of those links.  

And yes, some Italian Romans did travel to India and we know of even at least one trip by Romans to China.   But the major part of the trade links were controlled by Egyptians and Arab subjects of the Roman Empire.  

As to the trip by da Gama and the Portuguese going around Africa to link, that was largely in response to the Ottoman attempts to cut off Europe from those Eastern Trade routes.  The Ottoman's naturally wanted the profits for themselves, and the Europeans wanted in on the lucrative trade.   Also Portugal, even when Europe was able to get involved in that trade, was at the other end of Europe, so even then things were most expensive for the Portuguese.   So they had a natural interest in looking for a way around Africa where as other Europeans might have primarily been looking for ways to beat the Ottomans in a war.

I'm heavily into Canadian history too.   I like to quote [the JFK speech to the Canadian Parliament](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=8136) a lot.   And I also like to point out the the Anglo-American Alliance of WW2 was really a three-way Alliance where Canada more than pulled her own weight.    Canadian involvement in WW2 is often written up as if it was part of the British involvement in the War.   D-Day, for example involved the Americans taking two beaches (Omaha and Utah), the Brits taking two (Gold and Sword), and the Canadians taking Juno Beach.    Taken for all-in-all, and adjusting for population, Canada did more in the war than either of her larger partners in the Anglo-American alliance.

As such, the Iranian Jewish population fled the country.   Which is pretty much exactly what the Ayatollah's government wanted.   Iranian Ayatollah's are just as bad on the local Jewish populations as any of the Arab Grand Mufti's were or are. ",2016-03-10 20:33:05+00:00,d0v57e2,6.0,t1_d0v4uc7,457.0,SubredditDrama

Since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the vast majority of the Jewish population of Iran has fled the country.   In 1979 there were more than 100,000 Iranian Jews.   Today less than 20K remain in Iran.    Both Israel and the United States have larger populations of Iranian Jews than does Iran.

1131,"Super delegates are normally already elected officials who are members of the party.  For example, siting Congressmen, Senators, Mayors of relatively large cities, etc.   Sometimes they are also long-term former elected officials.  So, for example.... Bill de Blasio, Mayor of NY City..... is probably a Super delegate from New State State.   Probably also the case with the Democratic members of the New York State Congressional Delegation. 

And Super Delegates, in the end, always have supported the person who eventually got the most elected delegates.   Never once have Super delegates changed the outcome of the modern primary system.   

Now they are just a hold over from the old style of elections.  From the era when the Party Conventions actually made decisions.   Instead they now just ratify the winning campaigns policy statements and party for several days.  

You see, there was a time when there were very few Primary or Caucuses.  In 1960, for example, JFK broke with all previous tradition and entered all SEVEN primaries that year. He was Catholic and figured the only way he could get the nomination was to prove he could win an election in the primaries.    Remember, in 1928..... Al Smith lost a landslide to Hoover.   Smith's Catholicism was what many people blamed for his loss that year.   Now we find this weird, but there was a time when Catholics were considered some weird ""Other"" in the United States.  

Well, in 1968 there were 17 primaries.    By 1980 most states has implemented them.  Now all the states and territories have them.  Even non-states like Puerto Rico, Guam, etc. have them, and they send Delegates to the Party Conventions.    So, since every state has a primary (or Caucus), all the Delegates are known before they show up for the vote.  Everyone knows who they are pledged too, and so.... in 2008, everyone knew that Obama had won the battle with Hillary Clinton.   So Hillary released her delegates and they all also voted for Obama.  

The last time the Democrats didn't know who their nominee was going to be before the Party Convention was 1952.  And that one only went three ballots.   Too many party bosses, including then sitting President Truman, didn't want a real fight for the nomination that year.  All the major party officials weighed in favor of Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson (over Estes Kefauver, who was Senator from Tennessee).  

The last time there was a major fight for the nomination in the Democratic Party was in the 1920s.   

So now we have 50+ primaries in place, and Party Conventions are just parties.   Politics itself does not happen at the Political Conventions anymore.   They are now just Political TV shows for the Networks to broadcast.  In short, basically they are reality TV staged by the political parties to get their political message out.  

Super delegates are just a hold over from an old system.   They have never caused any real problem, and it makes a Congressman or Mayor feel important to be called a Super Delegate.   So..... since it's basically meaningless..... they let him continue to hold the old position.    

If Sanders wins more primaries, as he won Michigan last night (For example, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, New Jersey, California, etc.)  He won't need to worry about Super Delegates as he'll be the only person they'll be able to vote for come the convention.  As in 2008, Hillary Clinton would have been forced to drop out of the race before the Convention in such a scenario.    And if he can't win the majority of those states, then he won't be getting the nomination and his delegates will end up voting for Clinton at the convention. 

Our political system presidential candidate selection process is now all based on the primary outcomes.   The only role for the delegates to play an active role in and of themselves is in case something unprecedented happens.   

Every Presidential Election season sees somebody writing the stories about brokered conventions, Super Delegates, Dark Horse Candidates, etc.  And those things are technically possible, but so unlikely...... that they really aren't worth real discussion unless something unprecedented really starts to appear possible.   

Really, these stories get written because most of the real politics is just so boring.    So some writers like to open up the Pandora's box of unlikely but technically possible things.      Most of which are the equivalent of stories about hearing a galloping sound and instead of thinking horses, the author jumps to the ""What if they're Zebras? question instead.  Technically possible, but bloody unlikely. ",2016-03-10 00:24:02+00:00,d0u2pye,1.0,t3_49qoz1,4851.0,PoliticalDiscussion

Henry Ford and Alf Landon would have gladly and proudly defined themselves as Conservatives in the 1930s.   Where as FDR proudly embraced the term Liberal.    So did Truman.

There were Liberal and Conservative wings of both the Democrats and Republicans up until the 1970s.    The Southern Bigots that sat in the US Senate for decades were often actually rather liberal on many issues other than race relations.    A lot of them voted for the New Deal and later, even for the Great Society.   It's sad that they weren't able to embrace better race relations going forward.   They so wanted to remain racists that they shifted to the current right wing Republicans we now see throughout the so-called Old Confederacy.

Fascism is the marriage of the government with corporations.  It's the opposite of Socialism as it still maintains the concept of private capitalism.  

Just look at the 1930s, the people who admired the Nazis, such as Charles Lindbergh and Henry Ford, were from the right-wing part of the political spectrum, in general those who were members of the Republican Party.   And in the case of both Lindbergh and Ford, they refused to apologize for their support of Hitler even after the US went to war against Germany.   Even after the discoveries of the Death Camps and the plans for the Final Solution to the so-called Jewish problem.

Every election cycle somebody gets nervous and writes stories about the possibility of a brokered convention, but then it doesn't happen.   Again.   

Even the close 2008 election session between Obama and Clinton still resulted in a guaranteed first-ballot victory for Obama.   Brokered conventions have not happened in the modern political landscape.    Things are too organized now.   Every state and the several territories have a primary (or caucus) now.     Where as JFK entered all SEVEN primaries in 1960.    And a candidate running in all of the primaries was then unprecedented.  

In the close race the OP describes above, I don't think there would be any stopping the #1 candidate from clinching the votes before the party convention.   People may then walk around saying ""He only barely got the nomination"", but that will still be a unpreventable win for that candidate (in his party contest).

Just that the Soviets were wrong about most of the important foreign policy issues at the heart of the Cold War.    And the Soviets were wrong about a lot of things.  

She's got a lot in common with her husband, whom she agrees with on almost all important policy questions.   She also agreed with Obama on more than 95% of things.

A Super majority needed in the House for some things, like a veto-override would be 290 votes.     The Iraq War, at the time in 2002 and 2003, was super popular.    It was a mistake but at the time, a majority was no in favor of Gay-Marriage either.  

Cheney was against going to Baghdad in the early 1990s.  He changed his mind to be wrong and support an invasion.   He then did it watched it blow up and not work and yet still supports it.

1293,"When you look at Hillary Clinton resume, there is really no question about her being qualified to be President.  

* Graduated from Yale Law School. 
* Served on the board of directors of Walmart
* First Lady who helped to chart administration policy.
* Senator from NY 
* Sec. of State.  

On a pure resume level, there is no question that she's a good candidate.  

Yes, she is a moderator Democrat, but she doesn't really claim to be anything other than that.   As such, she is mostly in line with Bill Clinton politically.  I'm sure there are a few things she disagrees with her husband on, but they are odd-man out situations.   A Hillary Clinton White House will be mostly, from a policy point of view, like the Bill Clinton White House.  

Now, if you want somebody more to the left, that's cool.   Sanders is to her left, and those people who want a more left-wing agenda should vote for Sanders in that case.  

It drives me a little crazy when you see some people criticize Clinton for things that were largely true of the entire American Electorate at one time.    For example, she was against Gay-Marriage at one time.   But so was every other politician in the country.   A lot of people changed their minds on Gay-Marriage.    We went from early 1993 and the very contentious debate about Don't Ask/Don't Tell in the Military, to Gay-Marriage being legal nation wide in 2015.    The whole nation really shifted big time there.... something that even the majority of actual conservative Republicans support.  Though you wouldn't know that to look at the current GOP presidential candidates.   People want to call her a flip-flopper, but all it means is she, like a very large number of other Americans, changed her mind.  

And then there are people who say she voted for the Iraq War.  And she did.  And so did 29 other US Democratic Senators.   Only 21 Senate Democrats voted against it.    John Kerry voted fro the authorization of the Iraq War.   Here Hillary says it was a mistake.  Hindsight is 20/20....and again, people are allowed to change their minds and admit mistakes.   I don't understand all the people who think the Iraq War was a mistake who somehow want to demand that H.C. double down on her mistaken support for it.   People who learn from mistakes are better candidates and would, one hopes, make a better President.   

I remember toward the end of the W. Bush Admin a reporter asked him if he looked back with hind sight and thought he made any mistakes as President, and he couldn't think of even one example.    For the Sake-of-Pete, FDR, Truman, Eisenhower, LBJ, Nixon, Reagan, and Clinton each looked back and owned up to some mistakes during their White House Years, but W. Bush couldn't think of even one thing that in retrospect he would have wished to do differently.    Doubling down and claiming perfection is not a quality I want in an actual President.   Learning from mistakes and the past is important.  

I'm most likely to vote for Sanders right now.   Medicare for All is better than the current Obama-care.  But Obama-care was a good stepping stone area.   And to be honest, if Clinton is elected and adds 10 million more people to be covered by Obama-care, that would be an improvement to the current situation.  Not perfect, but America likes to inch up on things sometimes.  And the Republicans keep wanting to repeal Obama-care.   

When it comes to it, I'll vote for whoever the Democrats nominate.   I am not prepared to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  ",2016-02-04 22:06:17+00:00,czo2wo3,2.0,t1_cznvgf9,10249.0,PoliticalDiscussion

In 1976 Ford was a few delegates short going in to the GOP convention, and in 1984 Mondale hadn't officially cliched all the delegates he needed.  But in both cases they were the #1 choice during the primaries, and in each case it was only like 40 votes short.   What we now call Super delegates put them over the top.   

But a really brokered convention, where there was real doubt going into the convention over who a major party was going to nominate, you got to go back to the 1952 for an good example.    It's just not something that happens in modern politics anymore.   

Thing was, brokered conventions used to be the norm.   All political party conventions were brokered at one point.

Add in 20 or 30 other so-called problems with this evil chemical.  All while leaving out the basic fact that Dihydrogen Monoxide is just the chemical name of Water.  

Don't take my word for it, take it from Norman Borlaug.    He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for saving the lives of over a billion people from starvation.  Mexico, India, and Pakistan today are food net exporters directly because of his work.  For several years he was the only person allowed to directly travel between India and Pakistan without prior approval from both governments.  China then copied his work to help feed themselves.  

I'm sorry, but GMOs don't need to be labeled.  They are safe.   Demanding that they be labeled is as crazy as demanding labels on all meat sold at your supermarket that everything there is free of human meat.    Imagine how it would scare the shit out of people if every package of hamburger was labeled ""We 100% guarantee that none of this hamburger is secretly ground up human flesh"".    Nobody would buy it.  

Labeling GMO's is a backdoor attempt to ban them.   It's a way of making something totally safe appear to be unsafe.   It makes people think it must be unsafe, otherwise.....  Why would it need the warning label?  

Anyone who wants GMO labels on food should also demand that everything be labeled as ""Human Flesh Free"" at the supermarket.

Oy vey.   At /r/History we have an automod rule that replies to comments that claim that with the following:

---

Hi!   
    
It seems like you are talking about the popular but ultimately flawed and false ""winners write history"" trope! 

It is a very lazy and ultimately harmful way to introduce the concept of bias. There isn't really a perfectly pithy way to cover such a complex topic, but much better than winners writing history is *writers* writing history. This is more useful than it initially seems because until fairly recently the literate were a minority, and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that. To give a few examples, Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history, but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources, because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes. Or the senatorial elite can be argued to have ""lost"" the struggle at the end of the Republic that eventually produced Augustus, but the Roman literary classes were fairly ensconced within (or at least sympathetic towards) that order, and thus we often see the fall of the Republic presented negatively.

Of course, writers are a diverse set, and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias. The painful truth is, each source simply needs to be evaluated on its own merits.

1385,"Mayors are normally not responsible for large areas.   There are only a few cities that one could be Mayor of and be considered a possible Presidential contender.  The three most populated cities are NY City,  LA, and Chicago.    And those are probably the only Mayors who have consistent positions on the National Stage.    

There is also the unofficial experience most Presidents have to have before they run for President.   The most common previous positions being:

* State Governor (ie. Polk, Hayes, Cleveland, McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt, Wilson, FDR, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Bush II)
* US Senator (ie. Andrew Jackson, both Harrison's, Pierce, Buchanan, Harding, JFK, Obama)
* Cabinet member (ie. Madison, Monroe, JQ Adams, Taft, Hoover) 
* Vice Presidents who went on to become President (ie. Adams, Jefferson, Van Buren, Truman, LBJ, Nixon, Ford, Bush I).  Normally they had come from the ranks of Governors, Senators or Cabinet members.  Sometimes more than one of those things.  

There have been two Presidents who were primarily military men immediately before they were elected to the White House: Grant and Eisenhower.   They were each special cases, and had large political presences on the national stage.  The average person today could not name the Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs.  Washington might be another case of a military leader who became President, but he was also the major political leader at the Continental Congress.   And it was previous to the founding of the country.   Some other military men went on to the White House, but not directly, instead they chose to go the route of becoming a Senator or Governor.  

There were a few routes to the White House through the House of Representatives in the 19th century, and a few other posts that we'd now considered odd..... but after the modern Presidency emerged, with TR.... the unofficial required experience seems to be the major categories I listed above. 

Also, there are only 43 people to ever become President.  (Remember, Cleveland counts as both 22nd and 24th president, because of non-continuous administrations).   So there really isn't a large sample size to judge things on.  

I would guess that in most cases, people think that a Mayor should seek election as a Governor or Senator before they seek the White House.   But the limited sample size, and the limited major-cities that they could reasonably be expected to come from, might just be skewing the data were looking at.  It might just be coincidence.

Even when adjusting to per capita rates, the number of police shootings of people in the US are off the charts when compared to the UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, South Korea, etc.  

If the numbers are 1 in a million for the US, but the rest of the developed world only experiences 1 in 10 million, then the rate here is more than a little high.

1513,"Norman Borlaug was a big supporter of GMO foods.   He believed that there was no substantial scientific difference between GMO's and the plant breeding programs he used in the Green Revolution.   In his view, it is targeting research that helps to eliminate the need to wander down false-paths where you create plants you don't want to grow because they won't produce the required results.  

For those who don't know, [Norman Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug) was the driving force behind what is now called the [Green Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution).   He is created with saving quite literally billions of lives.    When he started his research, India, Pakistan, and Mexico were all net-importers.... countries with large populations that couldn't feed themselves.  Today they are all net-exporters.   Borlaug went after starvation and made major achievements towards it's elimination.

Silicon Valley attracts a lot of people who are smart about some very narrow field of endeavor, but who are often below-average in other fields.    

Case in point: Steve Jobs.   He died because he thought there was something super powerful in alternative medicine.    

There are a lot of people who forget that there are hard and fast physical laws of the universe.  People who when discussing faster than light travel will say ""They thought the sound barrier was real too"".   Without realizing that man has always understood that there are things that traveled at speeds faster than that of sound.    The issue was that there were those who didn't understand that a plane might be able to be designed to protect a human instead it and travel and super sonic speeds.    But strap that same person to the head of the aircraft nose-cone and you'll find that super sonic speeds will cause humans great bodily inquiry and probably kill them.    The question wasn't that anything couldn't travel faster than sound, but than an unprotected person couldn't.    And toward that, the people who said faster than sound travel for unprotected humans were basically correct.   They just didn't see that protecting people would be possible.   

But the limits on speed of light travel aren't just for people, but for all objects in the universe.  

People forget these distinctions about why people in the past were wrong.  They just say stuff like ""well, they were wrong about X.... when X is now widely available"".   They simply forget that there were a lot of caveats and explanations about why experts were sometimes wrong in the past. 

Another example is the assumption that the accepted wisdom was the flat earth before 1492.... when the spherical earth was commonly accepted then.  The major debated point was how large was the Earth.   In short, how far was Japan from Western Europe.....  Columbus said 2500 miles, where was the Church experts at the time thought it was more like 8000-10000 miles.   Taking enough supplies with you to sail 2500 miles would be difficult, but doable.    Sailing 8000+ miles wouldn't have been doable in 1492.     Columbus got lucky North and South America were where they are, cause the Church experts turned out to be right about how far away Japan was. 

A lot of wealthy people with more money than sense, think they are going to be proven right about something that changes the world.  The forget that a lot of those who ""were proven correct by history"" often were just lucky.   Or were only shown wrong because the problem wasn't well defined.

If anyone cares to note facts about indentured servants being compared to slaves.   Please see these threads and comments From /r/AskHistorians:

If you are going to judge on that level, then you and I have major political pull in Washington.   We're potential voters.    We have just as much, maybe more political clout in Washington than does the entire Planned Parenthood origination.    

But when we judge BS-clout amounts like that, then we're doing a major disservice the word ""clout"".    My non-existent cat has more political pull in DC than us and Planned Parenthood combined.  Somebody there might think he'd scratch 'em.

They have no political clout.  Which is why they are the right wings political punching bag.  They get less money from the Federal government than Lockheed Martin gets paid for just one weapons system.   You want to talk political clout, try talking about Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the NRA, GE, IBM, AT&amp;T, Koch Industries, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, etc.  

Those are people with political clout.  

Total S.A., the FRENCH Oil Giant has more pull in Washington DC power politics than Planned Parenthood.  As does Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia), Gazprom (Russia),  Petróleos de Venezuela (Citgo), HSBC (Britain), Barclays (Britain), BNP Paribas (France), and several other very NON-American cooperations.  

&gt; this money is effectively still subsidizing abortions. 

No, it's not.  And people who think that are irrational.   I would gladly allow 1000 times more funding to go to Planned Parenthood from the federal government.   Especially 10,000 times as much if we would stop buying things from Lockheed, General Dynamics, Boeing, etc.

1559,"I understand the logic of what you are saying, but I don't know if I agree with all of what you say.  

I think France could have made a decent run at being a Nazi-like empire.   (Assuming the French would have wanted that.  Which is itself a big assumption to make).  

Also, France had made claims to things like Low Countries, the areas of northern Italy adjacent to it, the Catalonia region of Spain, some parts of the current German Rhineland area. etc.    Are those areas logical extensions of France in the modern sense?  Not really, but they had each at one point been part of the French Kingdom or Napoleonic Empire at one or more points in time in the past.    Those claims had all fallen to the way-side by the early 20th century, but some Fascist dictator could have tried to revive them in some way.   That would have enlarged the French industrial base.  Especially if they somehow seized the Greater Ruhr Valley Region of Germany, which is (more or less) just across the border from France (assuming they have somehow snapped up the Low Countries).     

Remember in 1939 the world assumed the French Military was the strongest in Europe, if not the world.    Even a good number of German Generals thought that.    During the reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Hitler gave standing orders to retreat if the French moved to stop them.  Because at least in 1936, he thought it was possible they would be able to prevent it.   

So, I think an attempt at a Fascist-French Empire of some kind would have been possible.  Again, assuming the French would have wanted to do that.  

I think the reason for the Fascists coming to power in Germany was that German-people still remembered the Kaiser and his Authoritarian government.    It was only ~15-years since the end of WWI when the Nazis came to power in 1933.     

Where was France had had a Republican government since 1871.   There were not many people who remembered  a monarchy, and then there was the history of the French revolution and stuff to reflect upon as well.   If there was ever a Republican-Monarchy, then one might say that French sort of had those from 1830-1848 and then again 1852-1871.    Of course, that's overplaying the lightness of the touch of that French Kingdom and French Empire.... but when people are getting into patriotic fervor, they will try and make claims like that.    In effect, I think 1930's France was sociologically less likely (than the Germans) to embrace the idea of a Dictatorship. 

In conclusion, I think it's hard (if not impossible) to build an authoritarian war machine without an associated authoritarian dictatorship. ",2015-12-15 23:21:41+00:00,cy0csjs,2.0,t1_cxzjj30,55063.0,history

Not horror movie bad either, but actually really bad shit.   

Schools often avoid truly nasty topics, simplify them a good bit, clean them up and avoid by turning them into passing mentions in an effort to not scare fragile little minds.  Remember, kids in High Schools still often need signed parent permission slips to see a R Rated movie for their Senior Film Class where they see one movie a week and write a short essay on the movie.    The Teacher wants to show the *Godfather* and has to jump through 27 hoops to get the permission from the School Board, Principal, his Department Head and then have all the parents say okay too.   And the *Godfather* is pretty tame compared to what actually happened on the Bataan Death March.  

Now factor in that some of the kids often don't care all that much, and the teachers teach to the test.   If a subject isn't going to be on the Final Exam, teachers sometimes think it's not productive to spent a lot of time on it.

Tribune wire reports:  HONOLULU

A U.S. Supreme Court justice on Friday issued a temporary stay blocking the counting of votes in an election that would be a significant step toward Native Hawaiian self-governance.

Justice Anthony Kennedy's order also stops the certification of any winners pending further direction from him or the entire court.

Native Hawaiians are voting to elect delegates for a convention next year to come up with a self-governance document to be ratified by Native Hawaiians. Voting ends Monday.

A group of Native Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians is challenging the election, arguing Hawaii residents who don't have Native Hawaiian ancestry are being excluded from the vote. They argue it's an unconstitutional, racially exclusive process.

The ruling is a victory on many fronts, said Kelii Akina, one of the Native Hawaiian plaintiffs and president of public policy think-tank Grassroot Institute of Hawaii.

""First, it's a victory for Native Hawaiians who have been misrepresented by government leaders trying to turn us into a government-recognized tribe,"" he said in a statement. ""Secondly, it is a victory for all people of Hawaii and the United States as it affirms racial equality.""

Nai Aupuni, the nonprofit organization guiding the election process, is encouraging voters to continue casting votes, said Bill Meheula, an attorney representing the group.

""Reorganizing a government is not easy and it takes the courage and will of the candidates to take the first step to unify Hawaiians,"" he said in a statement. ""Help them by voting now.""

U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright in Honolulu ruled last month the purpose of the private election is to establish self-determination for the indigenous people of Hawaii. Those elected won't be able to alter state or local laws, he said.

The challengers appealed and also filed an emergency motion to block the votes from being counted. Last week, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the emergency motion, prompting the challengers to appeal to the high court.

""Enormous political, social and economic consequences are at stake,"" the application to the Supreme Court said. ""The delegates chosen through this election will decide whether to adopt a new government that will affect every individual living in the state, as well as hundreds of thousands of individuals identified as Native Hawaiians.""

They argued without Supreme Court intervention, there would be ""no remedy if the votes in this election are counted and the results certified,"" the application said. ""This election cannot be undone.""

1712,"As a mod of /r/Bestof let me address the /r/Bestof question.   At least from the mod-POV.  

To start with, /r/Bestof requires all submissions to use NP.REDDIT.COM instead of WWW.REDDIT.COM.    It's not a great souton, but anyone who has CSS enabled, (most people) are prevented from voting in any thread linked to from /r/Bestof.  Admittedly, people can get around this by disabling CSS or editing their URL destination.  But the subreddit itself has done what it can to dissuade voting in those threads.   

Likewise, any subreddit that does not wish to participate in /r/Bestof just needs to let the mod-team of /r/Bestof know.  We're happy to block submissions to a subreddit per that mod-teams wishes.     

Some subreddits don't like a always-disallowed rule and instead like to play it by ear,  on a per-submission to /r/Bestof basis.    So, any single thread that is similarly submitted but that the mod-team finds causes them troubles, we will remove it post-haste from /r/Bestof per that mod teams request.  

Same goes for the user-account who has their comment highlighted by /r/Bestof.   If it's your comment and you don't want /r/Bestof to highlight it, message the mods of /r/Bestof.    We're happy to remove it.  

Lastly, submissions to /r/Bestof need to actually be something that would qualify as *Best of*.   So, we often use mod-discretion to remove certain things in order to prevent other problems.    If you see a thread that you think is bad in some way, feel free to message the mods of /r/Bestof and we'll be happy to take a look at it.

As for good sources about World War I, I would urge you see the /r/History subreddit [Reading list](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/w/recommendedlist).  

Also, I would urge you to check out [The Necessary War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzTf87yaYMY) a documentary from the BBC.  In it Max Hastings outlines a bit of an alternate take on World War I, which he views as a good war and that many people who think it was a bad war just don't consider the possible alternatives.

[Link to the BBC description of the documentary](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03wtmz6). 

He thinks the reason that people think it was a bad war, or at least an unnecessary one, was that the peace afterwards didn't go well. But he asks how peace could have been made in such a way that peace would have lasted.

I am not sure I agree with him, but I think it's a view worth consideration. World War I is much more complicated than most people consider.  It wasn't just a bunch of idiots who picked sides in 1914 and decided to beat other senseless.   At best, that is a simplistic view.

Even though you can argue that it is all censorship that is still very much missing the point in using words like that. There is a perfectly acceptable word for what you are describing, a word that has been used for years now

- Moderation 

Now there is good moderation, bad moderation and awful moderation. On all three of these you can technically put the censorship label. However censorship is mostly used in a negative context where people want to attach a level of severity that isn't there. It is often implied to be related to censorship from governments or to be on the same level. Which frankly, is offensive to people facing censorship in their daily lives and can't simply avoid it by creating a alt account/moving to another subreddit/etc. To quote the wikipedia definition ""Censorship is the suppression of speech"", which simply is fundamentally impossible because of how reddit works. 

So think about this for a moment. Do you really want to discuss how subreddits are moderated? Or do you want to make it a political issue by equaling moderating (removal of posts and comments) with what some governments do to their citizens (persecuting citizens) ? Because in my opinion the first is perfectly acceptable and I would welcome that discussion. On the other hand if it is the latter I am going to pass.",2015-10-27 22:39:39+00:00,cwf6c84,2.0,t1_cwf2rfu,5281.0,modnews

1767,"Not really impeached.   

Officially the entire House could vote to remove him.  But in practice for that to to happen the Speaker or the Republican House Party caucus would need to support a vote for his removal.   But they are the very same people who put the Committee Chair there in the first place.   

So, short of him committing an unexpected offense, they won't remove him.   Especially since he's doing exactly what they expected him to do.    If you could convince the entire Republican Party Caucus that he needs to go, then you might have the start of a process to remove him.  But since some of them might want to fight even that, since there would be possible blow back on them for putting him there in the first place..... that  would just be a start. 

The major problem here is how the House rules are actually practiced.    In general, the members of the Party in control want their party in control.   They don't want to give the Minority Party any actual power.   They will take a private internal vote and then the winner of that internal vote is who all the members of the majority party then vote for in a floor vote.    So, while officially you just need a majority to vote for his removal, in practice, that majority needs to include a majority of the majority party.  

You don't get to call a vote where 188 Democrats plus ~30 Republicans form a majority.   Because the Republican caucus will come to an internal decision that all members than publicly support.   If the Democrats organized a Discharge petition to force a floor vote.... they would need support from ~30 Republicans.    And those Republicans would be victimized by their own Party Leadership.   They would lose all seniority, any committee chairs they might hold, get the worst offices, etc.  And the same thing would happen if they refused to support their internal party caucus.  

The modern version of this way of doing things in Congress is generally refereed to as the [Hastert Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastert_Rule).   But that's just a really strict definition of it.   In practice it's how Congress has been run for a long time.   It's just that in the past they sometimes allowed the minority party a little more breathing room.  But even then it was rare and would probably only occur when Speakers disagreed with their own party and had the political strength to resist it in a one-off situation.

1771,"There is so much bad history in that thread.  

Britain could only move about 300,000 troops into France by May of 1940.  Which was ten months later.    

There was no way Britain could have moved an Army into Poland in Sept, 1939.... especially when they would have to move them via the Baltic, which was then controlled by the German Kriegsmarine.    Now add the fact the German Army was already there, and the Soviet's were to pour into Eastern Poland just a few weeks later.   There would have been no possible retreat as if from Dunkerque either.  Any forces the British and French would have sent to Poland would have been entirely lost.    

That was obvious even in Sept, 1939.   

As to the Soviet take over of Eastern Europe at the end of WW2.... there was no preventing it.  The entire Soviet military was sitting on top of Eastern Europe come May, 1945.   Short of declaring World War 2.5 or 3 there would have been no dislodging them, and that wouldn't have been a guaranteed victory either.  The Soviet troops by then were battle hardened veterans who had just defeated better than of half the German War machine.    If the Allies had been willing to unleash nuclear weapons on the Soviet military there.....  fat lot of good that would have done the Eastern Europeans.  The bombs would have mostly been dropped on Eastern Europe to dislodge the Soviets.

1780,"The percentage of starving people in the world has deceased every year for the last century with the only exceptions coming the middle of World War Two.   And in just pure numbers, there are fewer people starving today than there were a century ago.   In the 1950's India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, etc. were all assumed to be about to suffer mass starvation and instead each of those countries figured out how to feed themselves.  

Mostly through the efforts of Norman Borlaug and those emulating and building upon his work.  

Heck, the rate of population growth in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan is now only a little higher than that of Europe.   In 1970 they were having 5.5 children on average per family.  Now they are at 2.2 children per family.    Family planning has made major breakthroughs and it's sad that most educated people don't know this information. 

There is still work to be done.   And we're no 100% out of the woods yet.  But these are solvable problems.  And solving them does not involve murder or allowing murder to happen.   These are more fixable than most people understand.   We just need the will to actual fix them.   

In short, we need to stop thinking these are unsolvable and/or insurmountable problems and therefore ignoring them.

He then went to India, Pakistan, China and Africa to help with food production in those parts of the world.  There was a point in the late 60s where he (and those working for him) was the only person allowed to freely travel directly between India and Pakistan because both of those countries wanted his help.  

[Freedom From Famine ~ The Norman Borlaug Story ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdTKUCM_8X4).  

The problems of starvation in the modern world only occur where there is war and food gets used a weapon to murder people one doesn't like.   Where food is deliberately prevented being delivered to those who need it.    Where is could be delivered with ease if it wasn't for war and politics.

And then those same Republicans complain about the costs of these programs because they are taking on large costs to catch the one in a hundred billion guy who is doing some magic trick to convince several teams of doctors that he has no legs.    

They do this because the Republicans want to shut down these programs entirely.   They don't care about sick people who need the help.  They want them to die.    Yes, I fully believe that is the end-goal of the Republican party for the conically sick and disabled:  They want people like my sister to just curl up and die.

1818,"The biggest problem with the idea that all the Generals sucked is that **all** of the Generals had to actually suck.    Not just the British generals, but the French, German, Austrian, Russian, Ottoman, American, Italian, etc.   All of them basically fought on their respective fronts in very similar ways.    You would think the Germans would have changed tactics to win the war, if it was so obviously bad-generalship all around.    But they didn't.  

The problem of World War I was that they were trapped in the 1910-1920 decade.   They didn't have fully working tanks or airplanes like WW2 did, and cars and trucks to use as troop transports were rare.   Horses pulling trailers were still the common method of moving around large equipment and troop transports.   When the troops weren't walking anyway.  And horses move at horse speed and not much faster.    

The Eastern Front in WW2 was even more deadly than the Western Front in WWI, but nobody sits around talking about how it was all bad generals that caused the mass-death.   I think that's because there was a lot of movement.   Generals were able to order their troops to seize a hundred miles of territory...... and because of mobility, the troops could move that hundred miles.   Might not be able to hold it once they were there, but they could get there and fight a battle.   World War One didn't really have the mobility involved.  So everyone assumes the generals were doing nothing when they were trapped in a era where the troops all had decent machine guns but few tanks and trunks to move quickly in.  

One can make the case that World War One generals look like do-nothings before of the limited movement of the era.  Where as World War Two Generals get a lot of glory because they seem to all be doing something....  not because they were actually any better.

Which meant taking all their regular stuff with them to their new home.    So they took cats and dogs and all the farm animals with them.   They were planning to set up farms and homes like they had in the UK and Europe, with hopefully warmer weather.    

On average, they would have thought we were crazy for warning them about cats and dogs becoming a major hazard for their future.   They wouldn't have been able to understand how 10 or 100 cats could breed into a major wildlife problem.      

Which is why they didn't take precautions against it.   They really didn't view it as a real problem.   ",2015-10-18 21:44:48+00:00,cw4fmkv,4.0,t1_cw44967,16820.0,SubredditDrama

Is it that they are large multinational corporation?   A big old $14-billion company.

That Monsanto sues farmers for seed that blew on to their fields?    Ignoring the fact that it just never happened. 

* https://skeptoid.com/blog/2014/06/19/gmo-labeling-consumer-protection-or-fear-mongering/

&gt;They do not sue farmers for seeds blowing into their fields. They have only pursued cases against farmers who deliberately tried to violate their contracts and essentially steal seed.

&gt;Myth 2: Monsanto will sue you for growing their patented GMOs if traces of those GMOs entered your fields through wind-blown pollen.

&gt;This is the idea that I see most often. A group of organic farmers, in fact, recently sued Monsanto, asserting that GMOs might contaminate their crops and then Monsanto might accuse them of patent infringement. The farmers couldn't cite a single instance in which this had happened, though, and the judge dismissed the case. 

There is so much BS-cruft out there about GMOs in general.   Please read the following....  as they expose the myths around GMO's and Monsanto in general.

We just handle it with the right attitude and ban anyone and everybody who needs to be banned.  We don't let screaming racists bully the mod team into allowing holocaust denial.  Or denial of other genocides from history such as the Holodomor, the Armenian genocide, the killing fields of Cambodia, the Rwandan Genocide, the Bengal famine, US Civil War apologia (Neo-Confederates), etc.

The ban-hammer approach to moderation is proven to work.   /r/History is one of the fastest growing default subreddits.   [Growing faster than the most other defaults](http://redditmetrics.com/r/history).

They have let a small but very vocal minority of racist-asshats take over the comment section and the mods who were willing to stand up to stop it where forced out.  

At /r/History we don't allow anti-historical topics. Period. That means Holocaust deniers get their comments removed, accounts get banned and when they argue pointless points in mod mail they get told that we don't tolerate their racism, and when persist they get muted.

Recently we posted a thread about Holocaust denial:

* https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3m329r/holocaust_denial_skeptoid_podcast_episode_485/

It predictably turned into a bit of shit show here and there, but largely the community supports the mod-team.   And that's because we're right. We don't back down in the face of a little criticism from stupid racists.   Instead we loudly announce that the racists are unwelcome, and when we need to, forcibly evict them from the premises.   And yes, that involves a lot of banning. But to not take proper action against them would be wrong.

All the major history-based subreddits mod this way to varying degrees.  /r/History, /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians, and /r/BadHistory each have slightly different approaches, but none of them allow free reign to racist Holocaust denials. 

We used that thread to discuss history. But it had the added benefit of allowing us to (1) remake our point about the History-denial and Holocaust-denial, and (2) used it as a bit of a honeypot to ban a whole bunch of people who needed to be banned.    The list of bans is very large, but only as large as it needs to be.

I still think this is the right approach to modding at /r/Europe. This is always the correct way to deal with racists. Always.

Just don't back down from the racists.   And yes, that's what they have a major problem is at /r/Europe. It takes a bit of fortitude, but it is what the mods there need to do.

Von Braun wanted to work with Rockets.   That meant finding state sponsorship for it.    In the 1930s the only country doing real rocket research was Germany.  After the war, both the United States and USSR governments started major programs into rocketry.   And both basically took any German scientists they could get their hands on.   

In the case of Americans, the German scientists were often surprised that the people from the US Military and OSS agents who were rounding them up for the rocket-science expertise often didn't know who Robert Goddard was.   As they saw themselves building on the work of Goddard in many ways.     They thought it was nuts that the US Military didn't know who their own American expert pioneers in the field were.

You mentioned [Dan Carlin](http://www.dancarlin.com/), both his podcasts are good.   His Hardcore history is very well done.   [He did an AMA here](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1fard6/dan_carlin_here_from_the_hardcore_history_podcast/) in /r/History a few years ago. 

The Mike Duncan podcasts are both great too.   [History of Rome](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/) and [Revolutions](http://www.revolutionspodcast.com/) are very much worth listening too.  [Link to his AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1fff0g/hello_i_am_mike_duncan_creator_of_the_history_of/) from a few years back. 

The [12 Byzantine Rulers](http://12byzantinerulers.com/) by Lars Brownworth is probably the grand daddy of the history-podcast.  As I think it was the very first one.   I'm not 100% sure of that, but it predates both Mike Duncan and Dan Carlin's podcasts.  Both of them reference his as a forerunner in the field.   Brownworth also did [Norman Centuries](http://normancenturies.com/) which is good, but it was slow to come out and it seems kind of forced at times.   [He did an AMA as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1fgvkd/hello_im_lars_brownworth_creator_of_the_12/). 

I also really like the [China History Podcasts](http://chinahistorypodcast.com/) by Laszlo Montgomery.   He jumps around Chinese history and doesn't come just one thing.   But sometimes he will do extended series on one Chinese history topic too.  He did a three part series on Zheng He and his treasure fleets, a Four Part series on John Service and the Dixie mission to China in 19444 and then McCarthy accusing of him being a Communist and all that stuff.     Or a long series on the life of  Deng Xiaoping.   The whole podcast is very good and I highly recommend it.   As with the others, yes.....

I mod /r/History and we don't allow any of the various forms of history-denial.    Just today we had [a major thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3m329r/holocaust_denial_skeptoid_podcast_episode_485/) about Holocaust Denial.   Holocaust denial is the largest form of history-denial around.   But there are others, be it people who support the Lost Cause of the Confederacy (almost always including slavery-apologia), people who deny other genocides such as the Armenian Genocide, the Holodomor,  the Killing Fields of Cambodia, the rape of Nanjing and Unit 731, Ancient Astronaut believers, etc.  

And these are not just the rules of /r/History.  But in general they are the shared rules also of the other major history-based subreddits: /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory.

Likewise, /r/Science and /r/AskScience both disallow science denial.  One of the mods of /r/Science wrote [an article about why they don't allow climate deniers there](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/).

I have been a long time listener of the Skeptoid podcast and this weeks episode is about Holocaust denial.    I think very highly of that podcast and gladly recommend it to others.  

There are a lot of people who try and lie about history and abuse it to try and drive home their own political talking points.   The Holocaust deniers are probably the worst people who do that.   Not that they are alone, there are other groups of history deniers out there.  Often centered around various other genocides, such as the [Armenian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide), the [Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor), the [Rwandan Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide), the extermination of the Native Americans, etc.   Or others who want to deny the effects of the [African Slave Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade),  or attribute great works to Ancient Space Aliens because of some preconceived notion that they see a self evident truth that brown people couldn't have built the pyramids, large temples, major cities, etc.   

One of the major reoccurring themes history-deniers seem to have in common is racism of some kind.  Weather it be hatred of Jews, Africans, Middle Eastern people, etc.  

Anyway, those who deny the Holocaust are a major problem for those who care about History.   In the same way that Science Denial will get you banned from /r/science and /r/askscience.

* Soft Banned domains:  domains that can be submitted, but always immediately goes to he spam filter.   They can be approved by a mod, but will always require mod intervention.   Which discourages their submission in most cases but allows those mods who want to check the submitter out to approve them. 
* (What I have called) Hard banned domains:  domains that can't even be submitted to Reddit.   They generate error messages saying the domain isn't allowed.   Period.  

Examples of domains that I know were soft banned previously are both CBSNews.com and NBCNews.com.

When I have encountered submissions in the spam filter that can't be approved (or confirmed removed), it's always been a Reddit database glitch of some kind.    Where you need to alert the admins to the problem for it to be fixed.

2016,"There is a scene in The Civil War documentary by Ken Burns of Shelby Foote describing an encounter between some Union troops and a single and Confederate solider. 

&gt;Early on in the war, a Union squad closed in on a single ragged Confederate. He didn't own any slaves, and he obviously didn't have much interest in the Constitution or anything else. And they asked him, What are you fighting for? And he said, 'I'm fighting because you're down here.' 

I'm setting aside a lot of other issues about the Civil War, but for a specific solider it's a good enough reason.  

The reason the Iraqi militias are fighting the United States in Iraq is clearly and simply that were there.   It's not our country and were smashing it into little pieces.   The Iraqi people have been forced by the United States to ally themselves with some religious wackos because the wackos are willing to fight.   The United States has no right to be in Iraq and yet were there anyway.   Obama says we pulled out, but we really haven't pulled out.   We've still got a massive military footprint in Iraq.  

So, similar to Winston Churchill, who said ""If Hitler invaded hell I would make at least a favourable reference to the devil in the House of Commons"", they are willing to make deals with the devil to fight the United States.  

They are fighting the United States because we're there.  And we have been in the Middle East for a long time.   They'll stop fighting us when we stop fighting them.   ",2015-09-20 03:10:17+00:00,cv7k8a7,5.0,t1_cv7jmty,1246.0,skeptic

Are any of those things that they may have invented and enabled for the modern world worth all the death and genocide they caused?  

The Mongols lived 800 years ago.  The German Third Reich was 70 years ago and we still have people around directly experienced and were targets of the Holocaust.    You can't really divorce the German Military machine that made the Holocaust possible from the horrors of the Holocaust.

2029,"Actually, most of countries of what we think of as the Western World normally only have two major parties that are considered actual possible choices to form a government.     

Take Germany as an example.   They nominally have six major parties.   But everyone understands that the choice in their Federal elections is between the CDU and the SPD forming a government.    

The other four major parties are only considered as possible partners for a coloration government.   One of the small-majors, the CSU, even has a formal agreement with the CDU to always be their best-buddy.   In effect, the net result is that the CSU is basically the CDU of Bavaria.     The Greens have something of a similar, if much looser, general alliance with the SPD.     The FDP were really hurt in the 2013 election, when they lost all their sets in the Bundestag.   Which leaves The Left, and they are generally considered to be undesirable by all as a potential partner, as they still carry a lot of baggage as much of the former-Communist party of East Germany. 

Likewise, in the UK their is just the Conservatives and Labour who have real chances at forming a government.   The Liberal Democrats were really hurt in their recent election, and UKIP and the SNP are each interesting, but not a threat to form a government.    The SNP only running candidates in Scotland.  And UKIP had broad support, that was so broad that while they got the third most votes, they won only one seat in Parliament.    

The only country that I can think of that has three major parties, each of which, might have a shot at forming a government right now is Canada.   But this is a recent anomaly, and may be because the NDP just might be in the process of replacing the Liberal Party in Canada as the main counterpoint to the Canadian Conservative Party.  Similar to how the UK Labour Party replaced the UK Liberal party in the post-WWI era.

Second, and more important to this discussion, to keep them from being taken out an enemy nuclear strike.     ",2015-09-10 19:55:27+00:00,cux3vms,5.0,t1_cux2b24,2388.0,PoliticalDiscussion

""Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate."" - John F. Kennedy

[Wikipedia article about the deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiations_leading_to_the_Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action).

To start off, the deal is not one between the United States and Iran.   It's a deal between Iran on one side, and on the other the US, UK, France, China, Russia, the EU and Germany.   The US is only one of the nations in the group negotiating with Iran.   

The facts of the matter are this.... ONLY Republicans in the Untied States wish to continue sanctions against Iran.  Nobody else in the world wants that.    This includes pretty much every single US Allie on Planet Earth save Israel.     If the United States does not approve the deal, then our EU and NATO allies, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, etc.  are going to discontinue sanctions anyway.   And so will Russia and China.  Which means the Iranians will be allowed to buy anything they want from anyone except the United States.  

The money you mention ($100 Billion) that is gong to be given to Iran is owned by Iran. It is for the most part NOT currently held by the United States, which only holds $2.8 billion (less than 3% of it) , but by the rest of the world.   The rest of the world that if the deal doesn't get approved will promptly give it back to the Iranians anyway.   In other words, Iran was going to get that money back regardless of the deals approval either way.    

Also, the deal limits the Iranian nuclear program.   Don't do the deal and the current non-limits on their nuclear program will stay in place.   In effect, the Republicans would quickly hand the Iranians a nuclear bomb to use at their leisure.  While the deal prevents them, for a time, from becoming a nuclear state.  The only thing that prevents them from becoming a nuclear power is a sheet of paper called the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty.   Nothing else.   This deal will put a regimen in place that will place other obstacles in their way.  

It's a lot of carrot and sticks.  Make the agreement and the United States will have some leverage over the Iranians.  Don't make it, and have no leverage and watch the Rest of the world implement their parts of it regardless of American disapproval.   The rest of the world just views the entire US Foreign policy in the Middle East as a giant failure they want no part of anymore.  And they are willing to break with the United States if congress rejected the deal.  

BTW, the President gets to veto any attempt at Congressional Disapproval of the deal.  Which is why Congress would need 2/3rds of each house to override the Presidents potential veto.  Which means that since 41 Senators  have stated they are going to vote for approval of the deal, that it's going to be approved since they can not override the veto.  

Reject the deal and Iran wins everything, gets to continue nuclear weapons development and loses only $2.8 billion held by the Untied States.   Approval the deal and get large limits placed on the Iranian nuclear program and keeps the international team putting combined pressure on Iran united.  

Really, nobody in their right mind who knows anything about this deal can be against it.   The only reason to be against it is if you want to invade Iran before the end of the year.  And the United States couldn't even invade and win in Iraq.   Iran is a county three times the size of Iraq in both area and population.   The only way for the United States to beat Iran in a war would be to use nuclear weapons on a massive scale and murder people in such numbers as to make the Nazis and Soviets look like amateurs.

2058,"Years ago, Isaac Asimov wrote an essay claiming that the pro-science Skeptic community shouldn't run from the idea that humans evolved from apes.  Sure, the common ancestor of humans, chimps and gorillas..... all the great apes, wasn't a modern ape or monkey, but to the common person today they would look like a ape or monkey of some kind.  

In doing a little Googling, I suspect the essay was ""Look Long Upon a Monkey"" from 1989.   I can't find a copy of it online right now.  

I don't think we should run from the ""we evolved from monkeys"" label.   Just say ""Yes, we basically are the decedents of monkey or ape-like animal.

A system like that would alleviate the admins from needing to be directly involved.  As some others have pointed out issues with the admins already not always responding to mod-mail or reports on other things.  ",2015-08-27 10:01:34+00:00,cuhaobo,6.0,t1_cugrndm,43777.0,changelog

Thing is, I don't think it would be political suicide.   People are just blindly believing  conventional wisdom.

The phone companies and the cable companies are too big.   All those are are industries where the companies all want to be so big that you have to use their services.   

So, if you think Monsanto is too big, fine.  Break them up for being too big.   But do the same to Chase, AT&amp;T, Time Warner, Lockheed Martin, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Exxon, GE, etc.    The size of multinational companies has nothing to do with the GMO issues.   

Monsanto is a big company.  It's a $14 billion corporation.  And that's not small.   But that's nothing compared to Exxon Mobil $394 billion valuation.   If you are worried about big companies with large legal teams that need breaking up, Monsanto is part of the problem.  But it's not the place to focus your initial efforts on.   Going after Exxon, Time Warner,  GE, Microsoft, or HSBC are going to give you real results.

Just addressing the issues of States Rights, you are going to have to explain to why why the Southern States really didn't care about them until after they lost the war.   For example,  Mississippi, in the declaration of treasonous rebellion, declared that they wanted to force every Northern State to make slavery legal.

Nothing said in the video is in any way controversial.  It's the accepted view of every main stream Historian of the Civil War.     

The reason that the accepted view is that Slavery was the cause of the US Civil War is simple.  All the other ancillary issues people like to bring up, all themselves contain the Slavery Question at their core.    

* States Rights.... to own human beings as if they were farm animals. 
* Southern agrarian economy, which was based on Slavery. 
* Tax Issues..... around profits made off of products produced by slavery labor. 
* Tariff Issues.... on products produced by slavery labor. 

You can't decouple the Slavery Question from the US Civil War.   It's the central core issue that can't be ignored.  

Confederate General James Longstreet was once asked what caused the Civil War.  His response was very direct:

&gt;If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about. ",2015-08-15 01:18:49+00:00,cu3giwu,2.0,t1_cu3coho,7387.0,videos

It happened because Freddie Mercury died.   As people from that generation got older they looked back at Mercury and Queen and got the idea that they missed something.

Which is generally what happens.   People get big, produce some major work that everyone loves, but then the artist keeps making new albums that some people love, but most people go ""meh"".  I suppose the classic example of that is Paul McCartney.    With a few examples, everything done by McCartney since the 1970s is.... well, it's okay, and there are some people who think it's great.   But generally most people think ""It's not like when he was working with John"".  

Thing is, this happens in a lot professions.  It's rare for a mathematician or physicist to done seminal work once they're past 40. 

Since there is no new work from him, people listen to what is great stuff.  And then they wonder why they didn't really take major notice when he was around.   

Anyway, it's a theory.  Probably bad.   Take it for what it's worth.  ",2015-08-09 04:19:23+00:00,ctwktwb,2.0,t1_ctwiz08,4057.0,SubredditDrama

2265,"As a mod of /r/Bestof, let me cut and paste of a comment I made elsewhere about /r/Bestof. 

---

The /r/Bestof mod team has rules that we observe in all situations. 

* We demand No Participation links (np.reddit.com).   Automod enforces this rule. 
* We don't allow witch hunts.   If we find them, we remove them. 
* We don't allow ""bad"" comments to be highlighted.   When we find them, we remove them.   
* If a subreddit requests an opt-out, we always enforce it.  Again, via Automodd.  So /r/TwoXChromosomes is never allowed to be submitted because the mods of 2X don't which to experience the /r/Bestof Hug under any circumstances.    We always respect these requests.  
* There are several *problem* subreddits that the Bestof mod-team has judged to be problems that are not allowed to be submitted.    Mostly these are witch hunty-type places. 
* If a subreddit generally wants to allow most submissions, but finds some to be occasionally problematic, the mod-teams of those subreddits can still request individual submission removals.   This is the route /r/AskHistorians goes.   They will occasionally ask us to remove a thread because they don't like the comment that was linked too from /r/Bestof.   /r/Bestof, as above, always respects these requests.  
* As with the mod teams requesting removals, if a user doesn't like that their comment was submitted to /r/Bestof, they may request it's removal as well.   So if /u/me has a submission and /u/me wishes it removed, then /u/me just needs to message our mod-mail and the mods of /r/Bestof will remove it.   Similarly to the mod-requests, we always respect these individual requests as well. 
* Lastly, we do look through our submissions individually from time to time, and remove anything else we find to be problematic.   Even if it just means falling back on our catch-all rule of:

&gt;The moderators reserve the right to remove posts, users, and comments at their own discretion.

There are other rules we have as well.   Things from our sidebar and a good number of Automod rule-sets.   But i don't know if any of those other rules play a part in your problem with /r/Bestof.   

But to reiterate our basic approach, we don't force any subreddit that doesn't want to be involved with /r/Bestof to play with us.  If you, as a mod of a subreddit submitted to /r/Bestof want a Bestof submission removed because it's causing you problems (as defined by you), then we'll always remove it.   Even to the point of blocking submissions to your subreddit 100% of the time via Autumod.  

Say what you want, but that's not something the other meta-subreddits will generally do.  

If you see something in /r/Bestof that you think is questionable or want our mod-team to look at, then please let us know.   We'll be happy too look into it. 

---

In effect, we strive to make the *Bestof* experience always positive.   The mod team is willing to shut entire threads down over any adverse reactions.

* https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3boun3/the_lost_cause_the_american_civil_war_and_the/

It's a long fight that the four major history-based sureddits on reddit (/r/History, /r/AskHistorians, /r/HistoryPorn, and /r/BadHistory) fight all the time.     The Civil War was about Slavery.  

All the other associated issues that people like to haul into the argument all lead back to slavery itself.  Examples:

* States rights - to own other humans as if they were farm animals. 
* The Southern agrarian economy, which was based on slavery. 
* Tax issues, where all the things being taxed are things produced by slave labor.  
* Tariff issues, where all the tariffs on on things produced by slave labor. 

The Southern leadership was very up front that they were fighting for slavery from the beginning.   The [Cornerstone Speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech) delivered by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens directly states:

&gt;The new [Confederate] Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions—African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization.  This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. 

Note that the Confederate Constitution, which was largely a cut and paste job from the original US Constitution made permanent the nature of Slavery in the Confederacy.   The US Constitution allows for things to be changed via the Amendment process, and the Confederate Constitution largely allowed for the same thing.  With **one major exception**, slavery could never be amended away.    Slavery was going to be a preferment fixture in the Confederacy, even in the unlikely future hypothetical case where every single Confederate Citizen wanted to remove it.

Lastly, James Longstreet, Confederate General was asked in his later years what the cause of the Civil War was, his response:

&gt;If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about. 

I will take the word of Longstreet and Stephens over anyone else.  They were there for the Civil War.  They knew more what it was about than any living idiot who is doing nothing but creating apologia screeds for racism.   ",2015-08-05 01:03:00+00:00,ctrso2y,1.0,t3_3fr0mk,38129.0,skeptic

From [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2pi4qm/how_accurate_is_the_proclamation_that_irish/cmwxmaa):

&gt;The short answer to your main question is that the ""proclamation that Irish slavery in America was as widespread as African slavery"" is totally, even laughably untrue. Something like 12.5 million Africans were transported in bondage from roughly Columbus through the 19th century. While bonded Irish labor was not unknown in the Americas, it was nowhere near as widespread as African slavery. Moreover, historians over the past two generations (roughly) have found in studying both African slaves and European indentures that it really doesn't make sense to think of Irish or other Europeans working in the Americas, even those in some sort of bonded arrangement, as ""slaves.""

And from [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ou972/are_there_any_sources_regarding_irish_slavery_in/ccvpv9s):

&gt;There were no Irish slaves in the New World. Let's define our terms: I'm going to define slavery, for our purposes, as ""lifetime hereditary involuntary servitude.""

&amp;gt;I haven't seen any personally ""nasty stuff"" about Pao

&amp;gt;Nothing based upon her Gender or Ethnicity/Race.

Hey there!

I was curious about this myself, so I did a little bit of research.

Right now 16 of the top 20 posts *of all time* in KiA are about Ellen Pao directly (the post includes her name in the title) or indirectly (either about policies she has made or holding her responsible for things happening on reddit).

Weird, right? This sub is 10 months old but 80% of the top-upvoted posts in the subreddit are about Ellen Pao. Huh.

I know, I know : It's actually about ethics in games journalism.

Here are some choice net-positive-vote-total comments from just the top 5 Pao-related posts on KiA:

2439,"The best run subreddit communities are the ones that have mod-teams that enforce the rules and don't allow any hate-speech and other bullshit.  

For example, /r/Science does not allow bullshit opinions that aren't scientifically valid.    Either as submissions or comments.    So, they will ban you for creationism, anti-vaccine BS and [climate change denial](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) as these are all views that are backed by all the world scientific community.    In short, they want everyone to know that /r/Science is scientifically accurate.  The same goes for other science based communties on Reddit such as /r/AskScience and /r/Biology.  

Likewise, /r/History and other history-based subredits like /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory don't allow history-denial.   So, things like Holocaust denial, Lost Cause of the Confederacy propaganda,  Ancient Aliens crap, Neo Nazis, White Supremacy and other total bullshit views will get you banned.  

There is a large problem with hate-based groups that are trying to *colonize* (their word) Reddit in their attempt to spread their views.  Hate based groups like: White Supremacists, Neo Nazis, Skinheads, Holocaust Deniers, Extreme Misogynists, Homophobes, Racists who view all Muslims as terrorists, Extreme Racists, etc.   It's a large number of groups, and there is a massive amount of overlap between these subgroups.  

These radical nuts run subreddits like: /r/CoonTown, r/GreatApes, /r/European,  /r/Holocaust (holocaust deniers), /r/TheRedPill, /r/KotakuInAction, etc. 

Right now, [/r/CoonTown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org).  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.  

If they don't take care of it, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more [media outlets](http://gawker.com/so-long-reddit-1717315112) will start pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.    

Another point that largely gets  ignored in this debate:  Non-racists generally don't want to hang out with racists.   Racist and hate-group users generally strive to drive out the non-racist users.    

Everybody has a story about the racist family member that they only see once a year at some family gathering,  and we all dread running into that family member.   We really don't want to hang out, even for a short amount of time, with that person.   Well, when it comes to family we make sacrifices, so we (1) try and only talk about the weather or sports with them and (2) are very thankful it's for only one-hour a year.     But when it comes to non-family, you don't make the same allowances.    We just cut those people out of our lives.   

Bad users will drive out good users.  And then more bad users will be attracted to this site.  And it will become a bad-user reinforcement-cycle with more and more bad users driving out, they hope, all the good users.    These groups even know this, and count on the non-racists leaving.  It's why they use terms like *Colonizing*, as they are actively attempted to take the entire site over.  That is their goal.   They are not interested in undirected discussion with anyone.  They want to control the narrative and how any discussion happens.  They are actively trying to turn young people who aren't already racist bigots into more racist bigots.     If you allow them to run wild, 90% of the good users will leave.  And what's left will simply be a Storm Front members wet dream.    

Paul Graham mentions this issue with bad users in [this essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html).

Other web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups. It's high time that Reddit did the same. 

I also want to address the BS that some limits on free speech are inherently bad.   Because the only country that really thinks free speech means ""Anything Goes, including extreme bigotry"" is the United States.     But other nations, such as Germany, France, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Italy, etc.  place some limits on ""Free Speech"" via bans on things like Holocaust denial.    Now..... I'm sorry, but you can't tell me Germany or Canada is any less free than the United States.    The reason the Germans don't allow open-Nazis into the political debate in their country is that they tried it once.   It ended badly. 

In short, you don't allow these people a foot hold because their goal is to make Reddit into a hate-propaganda site.   Hopefully the admins are finally going to do something about these groups.   It's high time the admins took action.

There were often submissions to backwater hate-based subreddits about Ellen Pao that had comment chains which were all comments about her sex and race.  This was well before the blow ups with the mods.

Subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/SubredditCancer, /r/Undelete, /r/KotakuInAction, /r/Redpill, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/GreatApes, etc. all made common-cause in the effort to say nasty stuff about Pao.

That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.  

As such, the admins need to directly address the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/Holocaust and other subreddits that solely exist as propaganda outlets for pure hate.     If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.  

Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more media outlets will pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.

2463,"Web sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google+ have taken to dealing with racist hate groups.   It's time for Reddit to do the same.  

When a site allows racists to run wild, good users will leave because they will not wish to associate with racists.   In effect, bad users will drive out the good users.  Those users who leave are replaced by more bad users who are attracted by the permissive attitude.   By allowing racists free reign, they will proliferate and become an even larger problem.

The same goes for similar groups that espouse holocaust denial, proponents in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Lost Cause of the Confederacy crazies, believers that all-Muslims are terrorists, etc.   One also finds that these other fringe groups all have more than a small amount of overlap with the white supremacist racist groups.

/r/History removes hundreds, if not thousands, of comments on a daily basis.  This is true for several subreddits.  We also ban people a lot for breaking our rules against history-denial.   Holocaust denial is just the #1 form of history-denial.   There are several other types.

The Confederacies own leaders said they were fighting the war for slavery.   The Cornerstone Speech by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens explains point black the the Southern States were attempting to found a new nation based on """"upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition"".  

So Lincoln decided that to win the war for real, Slavery had to be eliminated.   After the war, the former Southern leaders took to rewriting their own history to say that they were fighting for other things.   Normally bringing up States Rights, but also talking about the Southern Agrarian Economy, Tax issues, Tariff policies,  etc.   But each of those alternate explanations for the war are all really just the slavery question in disguise.  

Southern Economy was based on slavery. 

Tax issues, around profits made from goods produced by slavery. 

Tariffs on products again produced by slavery. 

States rights, to own people as farm animals.  

Slavery is the core issue the war was about.    Every other issue involved in the war was, at it's heart, also the slavery issue.  

After the war, Confederate General James Longstreet was asked what the Civil War was fought over.  His response was simple:  ""If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about"".   He knew what his war was about.  Saying it was about anything else is outright lying.  

Frederick Douglass became one of the people who helped turn Lincoln into the *Great Emancipator* after his death.    Douglass understood that Lincoln had figured out that the root cause of the war was slavery and that he then fought to destroy the very institution that caused the war.

The current mod team here continues to remove similar threads every day.   Not that you care really, because facts are actually unimportant to you.  

Racism and hate are a major problem on Reddit.  We know this because the Users of /r/Europe have said it was a problem. See these threads from /r/Europe on the storm front problem:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y0tbb/headsup_popular_neonazi_site_daily_stormer_is/

And it's a problem faced by all of Reddit.   For example, the definitive /r/History comment statement on the problem.  

* https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2puapu/alfred_hitchcocks_memory_of_the_camps_very_nsfw/cn0a25e?context=3

The history-based subreddits of /r/History, /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians, /r/BadHistory, etc. all ban users for racist and hate-filled opinions every day.  Be they racism, holocaust denial, NeoNazis, NeoConfederates, Pro-Slavery or simple history-fact denial.    World War Two happened, denying it will get you banned for that alone.   And no, the mod teams don't care if you agree with how we mod the subreddits.   If you don't like it, then you are free to unsubscribe at your earliest opportunity.  

Back to the issue of subreddits going private, /r/History was taken private after a long discussion among the mod team.  We were the fourth default subreddit to go private.  Only a few minutes after /r/Movies did so.   I was the one who made the setting change to take it private.   

We then made it available again after the Admins had made statements in various backroom mod-only subreddits.   /r/Science had already decided that it was time to come back, and we followed suit because the admins will giving the stated mod-issues the required attention.

In short, mods doing their jobs are important for Reddit.   Mod tools have not been updated in several years.   Tools like /r/Toolbox which were created by people like /u/Creesch and /u/Agentlame are stop gap measures that they themselves have asked for the admins to copy their work for the benefit of all communities on Reddit.

2565,"My sister ended up renting the whole conference room area at a major hotel for the wedding.  It included a weekends worth of rooms for the her and her now husband, the wedding party (ushers and brides maids) and both sets of parents.  About 10-12 rooms.  Included a stocked bar for the reception after the civil service they had performed.   All for cheaper than the church wanted for one day in mid-October in the North East.  

And it was at a Church she is an active member of too.   You would think that they would give a break for people who are really members of the Church.  

I'm sorry, but everything about it was crazy.   They got more space, more time, hotel rooms, didn't have to have a cash-bar, etc.   Way more than her own Church could have provided and it was cheaper.

2574,"""If [the Civil War] wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about"".  - Confederate General James Longstreet responding to a question as to the cause of the Civil War.  

Coupled with the [Declaration of Causes of Seceding States](http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/amgov/secession.html) and things like the [Cornerstone Speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech) by  Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens.... the cause of the war was Slavery.   

All the ancillary other factors that people like to bring up, be it tax issues, tariffs, states rights, the Southern agrarian economy, etc.  Each of those other contributing factors contain slavery at the core of their being.  They can not be discussed in any logical way without directly discussing slavery.   Slavery can not be decoupled from the causes of the American Civil War any more than violence can be decoupled from war itself. 

This means the confederate flag (or the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia if you prefer that name) is all about being a believer in slavery as if it was a good thing.

2628,"All the other reasons for the Civil War that you can come up with all lead back to Slavery.  

The Southern Agrarian Economy.... based on slavery.  

Tax issues.   Based on funds raised by working slaves on Southern Plantations.  

Trade issues.... around crops that were farmed by slave labor.  

States rights.... to own human beings as if they were farm animals.  

Not a one of those other issues does not lead directly back to slavery.    There is no other issue involved in the US Civil War.  It's 1all 100% of it about slavery.    Every other issue in relation to the causes of that war is actually the slavery issue in disguise.  ",2015-06-19 11:43:40+00:00,csbr4qo,8.0,t1_csbohkf,10966.0,TrueReddit
2629,They believed in so much freedom that the one freedom that was totally and forever to be banned by the Confederate Constitution was that Slavery could never be banned.  The one and only state right that they were totally fighting for was itself to be limited from the very beginning.   Slavery was to be a forever pact of the Southern States that seceded.    Advocating for change on that front was to be banned forever and ever.  Plus a few more years.  They considered slavery so important that they really drove it home in their treasonous rewrite of the Constitution. ,2015-06-19 11:40:38+00:00,csbr2ud,6.0,t1_csbo5b1,12234.0,TrueReddit

2637,"It was never all that true.   The mythology about it is mostly something that admins let develop because countering it with reality would have involved doing something, like typing out a few comments.    Mostly the admins were very interested in something other than talking to users.   Which is mostly still the current modus operandi.

They think they have a god given right to attention.   I'm sure they write angry letters to the TV Networks demanding to know why they aren't regularly interviewed on the morning and late night talk shows.  ",2015-06-16 08:17:53+00:00,cs865kw,3.0,t1_cs7uaqy,26523.0,SubredditDrama
