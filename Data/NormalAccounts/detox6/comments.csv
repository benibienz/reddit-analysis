2,"Not to show hate towards gross gore, but I believe he deserved this and had this coming. Twitch and streaming are considered jobs. When an individual is in the workforce, they are accountable for their own actions and comments. There are many companies that enforce the protection of workers from harassment. I just watched the full video of gross gore's rant and what gross gore is saying about febvien and krepo is considered ""workplace harassment"". Work placeharrasment is when an individual is engaging a vexatious comment or conduct against another worker. Therefore, if he is working in a company building and says is exact dialog from this rant, he would be fired on the spot, similarly to how twitch is banning him. 

Not to mention that this isn't the first time gross gore has been warned from twitch.

Thus, do I feel pity, no. Does derseve this? I believe so",2016-04-20 03:00:34+00:00,d29u2q8,1,t3_4fkh1c,12150,leagueoflegends
