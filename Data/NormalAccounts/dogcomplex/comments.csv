3,"Well, to be fair, we've never had a voting system that could capture people's true preferences on ""sound policy"".  We've been corralled into a system of choosing between two parties which each (effectively) internally choose the candidate they want to run, with the policies they want to put in.  We have some control over the rhetoric of those policies (they have to appeal to voters) but only insofar as they distinguish themselves from the other side - which isn't much wiggle room.  In effect, we don't live in a true democracy, we live with a choice between two oligarchies, run by a propaganda-filled media, entirely game-able by those with enough money to influence both parties.  Blaming the people is like blaming rats for choosing to eat cheese because their scientist overlords only give them a choice between cheese and carrots.  That's what the 1% ordeal is - it's much more about opening up control of the country to the people (and away from those able to influence or monopolize it through money and political connections) than privileged people whining for more free stuff.  It takes a certain blindness to see the problem as merely people not voting intelligently (as it does to say it's *just* the 1%'s fault).  It's a mix, but those protesting the ""mainstream"" news-media narrative that it's the voters' and the consumers' fault rather than the political and financial elite is rather creepy - so of course you're going to see a counterculture pushback calling to bring down the establishment.",2016-11-21 00:16:07+00:00,da8udtm,2.0,t1_da7t75r,72176.0,GoldandBlack
4,"I admit it sounds good, but I still have doubts.  It's one thing to support welfare as a societal rule that you know everyone will have to pay a (relatively) equal percentage to provide.  It's another to volunteer personally to pay towards that service, knowing you can opt-out and go without communal welfare if you don't need it (i.e. middle class and above - the ones with money).  I have doubts that individual charity can even come close to a mandatory communal tax, and we wouldn't be able to sustain the same level of safety nets that we have now - not without those who donate paying huge amounts, further de-incentivizing the whole thing.  It's much easier to espouse noble ideals when you know you'll only have to pay a small fraction of the burden.  When you tell people they have an inherent moral right to their property and don't need to share if they don't want to, suddenly that burden becomes much larger for the few who remain.",2016-11-21 00:02:56+00:00,da8tt10,6.0,t1_da7rvbr,73817.0,GoldandBlack
5,"Ahhhhh, very interesting take - thank you so much for that!  So from one perspective it was a ""greedy banks making bad loans"" thing, but from another (which, as you put it that way, makes much more sense) it was a greedy government centralizing mortgages and taking on bad risk for political/economic short-term gain, with the banks more than happy to follow along because they profited off it.  I like it.  So, then assuming this wasn't just pure ignorance and they knew what they were doing, it's more the government/lobbyists who made this happen's fault (Bill Clinton and co? who else?) than the bankers - but they were complicit too (and/or pushed the idea in the first place...).

10,"Ahh, I'm beginning to come around.  You're thinking more like neighborhood-level law-sets - so people can switch lifestyles easier depending on the region, without fear of oppression from the lawman.  And yeah, I guess it all depends on how contracts are set up to prevent someone from e.g. joining a law set just for the welfare benefits then bailing after - they'd have to have some clause that forces a 10-year commitment or something at least.  That's the main problem I see with this: What happens if you're a poor person that's not particularly ""wanted"" by any law-set, due to being generally a drain on social security?  Does this not quickly create a hierarchy of wealth - where people quickly leave for more insulating law-sets as soon as they're rich enough (e.g. super low tax law-set), and/or find it difficult to enter such sets when they're very poor?

13,"First off thank you for the long reply!  That's an interesting take - that it's the lobbying that's the problem, not the rich inherenty, and I pretty-much agree.  Your solution, though, sounds a lot like... well... nations!  Or at least, nations with the accepted motto ""if you don't like it, leave"".  It would be more interesting if we could remove geography from which law we accept, and it seems like this system would benefit from some global structure that ensures free switching from one nation/law-set to another, but sounds like it's not too far-off.  Problem I see is what happens when two nations/law-sets are in conflict?  War?  What happens if the most popular law-sets are corrupted, and the people in them are indoctrinated with propaganda to continue thinking they're the Greatest Country In The World (*cough*) - and all you're left with is escaping to a fringe law-set that has limited collective resources and deals daily with issues caused by the larger law-set that it can't change without its cooperation?

I'd also add that I don't think you're advocating for an end to democracy - those are strong words - I think you're advocating for an end to the concept of a single-law-set.  Democracy could still be useful as a decision-making tool within a law-set, with the ultimate choice of abstaining and changing sets (Moving to Canada, heh) - that you usually would still rather not employ because of inconvenience of switching.  (Note: not FPTP democracy - that system's always retarded)

So in this context, I think your system is entirely possible and encapsulated by the current world and its nation states.  Unfortunately, the inconvenience of switching nations is pretty big right now, and we don't have particularly good meta-laws that ensure fairness between nations - power and diplomacy prevail.  I'm sure you also imagine a future with borderless law-sets and multiple law-sets per person (choose a set in each issue) probably with more set options than the 195 countries in the world.  But even assuming you had that, I don't see how you could have peaceful, fair, meta-laws (laws between sets) that are also easy to change between (necessary for switching from unjust law-sets, but allows exploitation by benefiting under one set then switching to another when it's time to pay up e.g. welfare).  

In short: I don't see how you could have law-sets without having meta-law so extensive that you're essentially under one big law-set with a few deviations just for fun.  If that's the case, then I find it just as likely (if not more) to hope that people generally have the same sense of right and wrong deep down and we've just failed to agree well because of past injustices that cause generations of grudges or failed reasoning, as well as a deeply corrupted system - and if we just calmed down and reasoned it out we'd get a single law-set that's mostly alright with everyone.

23,"Also, while I'm at it, we need to get our policies totally in-line with intelligent economics.  For all my love of Bernie, he faced some real criticism from economists on the feasibility of certain plans.  It's fair, since his campaign started largely about pushing the Dems to the left and was meant to be about inspiring better values rather than concrete plans, but it turned off the economic center.   We can be authentic, non-corrupt, maximally progressive, but *realistic* economically - at least to the point where it's a legitimate debate among economists.  We should aim to have *no* policies that are overly-idealistic (without admitting so, as values to strive for) and attempt to build a political discourse of truth and accuracy as much as progressive idealism. 

Actually, that would be a very interesting approach to a political movement: aim for factual, evidence-based policies that can't be disputed with off-hand arguments.  The age of soundbyte politics is ending, as people tune out of the media for its ridiculous bias, and the age of value-based left/right tribalism is ending too, as it's clear populist movements on both sides dominated the race.  A party that aims for smart policies that are broken into explainable pieces and uses a new era of *network politics* can bridge traditional left/right camps and become the obvious truth to millions of americans.  Think about how long this last election seemed to go - and how much time it spent being bombarded into the minds of americans.  If they spent even a half hour of that time understanding an ELI5-version of an intelligent, realistic policy instead of just deciding who they hate more, people would immediately fall in love with the ""underdog"" intelligent candidate and think they decided it themselves.  This is something Trump has NO defense for - and nor do the traditional Corporate Liberals  (but if they try to match - all the power to them!).

24,"Thank you.

As a Bernie supporter who lost faith in Hillary as her manipulation of the primaries was revealed and her scandals hit, I'm sorry too.  We didn't fight for her like we fought for Bernie.  I'm sure plenty of us still voted for her, but it wasn't enough - and we weren't the inspiring, phonebanking force that we were during the S4P days.  I think, had the primaries gone more respectfully to the Sanders camp - had the media and party collusion not been so evident, especially when delegates stormed out of the building and Wikileaks hit, had the S4P community not been scattered to the wind, and had she shown a hint of remorse or empathy - we would have respectfully bowed our heads and worked almost as hard for Hillary as we did Bernie.  But... politics is a nasty business, and those who play dirty soon lose all respect.  We disrespected Clinton - we threw her under the bus - and her loss is on us too... for reacting with anger and revolt, when we needed to be above that if we really cared about beating Trump.  But for many of us - she was just as bad, if not worse - with her subtle but wide net of globalist moderate power.  Not supporting her was unfortunately a choice in the end - and every one of us who didn't will have to live with that choice.

Regardless, we understand your choice - and we know this election outcome was hard to see.  Clinton seemed like a solid candidate to many - especially those who hadn't seen the side we had - and she was worth a shot.  It wasn't your fault - it was systemic, and it was a race against time to beat an overwhelmingly strong opponent.  We wish it could have gone differently, too.

What's important now is that the liberals, progressives, Hillary supporters and Berners realize what we have to do:  realize that the old corrupt politician approach will not work anymore, nor will an apathetic and dispassionate party of people voting for the lesser evil.  We need to rebuild the movement, and become the de-facto opposition - kicking these failed politicians in the teeth - and then we need to bring down the obvious evils that are the GOP and Trump.  But we need to do so by being authentic, by being truthful, by being idealistic but not alienating to the people who voted for Trump because they wanted someone who spoke a language that wasn't just lies (lol), and by being the answer to both an age of failed Corporate Liberalism and the new age of Authoritarianism.  We need to avoid overusing simplifying slurs like ""racist"", ""homophobe"" and ""biggot"" to refer to a swath of people that obviously aren't those things - but no longer care if they're labelled it, because they feel so disenfranchised and frustrated by a world that seems so upside-down.  We need to realize that the people - the actual people - really aren't that different, even on the fringes of left and right wings.  There are problems / people we can all unite against, there are solutions we can all agree on with the right information and plan, and there are conversations we can have with our neighbors that make us realize we may come from different ideologies but deep-down share the same values.   If we run an authentic campaign, with a focus on unity and not fear, we can win over the right and we can take this country back to a height it's never been at before.  We're all responsible for this mess, and we're all responsible for fixing it.

57,"I get all that.  Trump is awful and no one's savior.  (Though Clinton is also a monster)  

&gt;For that matter, why did they think they had to choose Trump or Cruz?

That may very-well be attributable to Clinton's collusion with the media pushing ""pied-piper"" extremist candidates in the Republican party so they'd appear as serious contenders.  We always wondered why the media was so deadset on reporting Trump stories back then.  They were probably profitable, but they were also probably asked to.  (Coupled with plenty of legitimate support, and plenty of trolling too.  Who knows what proportion.)

Need I point out - if that is indeed what happened, there's no reason the next election won't have a similar boogeyman Republican for Hillary to face.  Of course, there's no reason to hope Trump would solve anything - aside from the glimmer of hope that the bastard hasn't been funded by Goldman Sachs and co.   It is a small glint, at that.

58,"Were the ""monsters"" just the two people, I'd be inclined to agree. The ""monster"" that is Clinton is her entire network of propaganda, corruption and collusion which has certainly been around for ages, but is rarely so exposed as it has been here.  That monster is arguably far scarier than any one man can ever be - and far, far harder to weed out (or even see.  We are experiencing a rare window through the propaganda).

Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that ousting Clinton wouldn't just win Trump an invite to that network - and it would just use its new crazy-face to do whatever it wants.   On the other hand, if a Trump win got a criminal investigation of Clinton and her whole network - destroying their political power for good - any ""sociopath"" damage or rolling-back-the-progressive-clock he does would be well-worth it (and would foster a huge counter-movement among progressives that would oust him by 2020).

Neither deserves an ounce of trust.  The stability Hillary brings is the stability of a world run by profiteering unaccountable sociopaths (as they have for decades, but now exposed enough to smash and grab what they can).  The chaos Trump brings is a world run by a crude ignorant authoritarian sociopath.  Take your pick.",2016-10-31 08:18:03+00:00,d9f3lzq,4.0,t1_d9f37w2,1433.0,WikiLeaks

69,"I had to look up Priebus: he didn't endorse Trump until long after he was already the presumptive nominee and leading in the polls, and gave him plenty of criticism throughout the primaries.  He did not need to be involved in any conspiracy - only had to do what was best for the party, which was to encourage unity behind one candidate (no matter how shitty), and that appears to be what he did.  That doesn't preclude that he may have had back-door incentive to do so - e.g. republican funders putting pressure on - but I don't know and it's not necessary.   

Media collusion, working to elevate Trump at the request of Hillary's campaign - and more accurately, at the request of the media owners funding her campaign - is a factor though.  As is who was funding whom.  Jeb Bush's campaign was the most well-funded among ALL candidates in the primaries, largely from financial institiutions, but as Trump outpaced him in polls he spent what was left before the third state and dropped out, without any new funding.  They made an investment in him, he flopped, they switched gears.  It was then looking like Trump vs Hillary - Trump most likely to win the Republican nom but least likely to win the general.  Thankfully, they already had investments in Hillary.  So they double-down on her, do what they can to help Trump clinch the republican nomination, and ensure an easy matchup for her in the general.

No mind control powers.  Her puppet masters just play both parties.  It's not fucking rocket science - there are only a handful of options.  These guys invest on FAR less predicable markets than that. ",2016-10-22 23:59:23+00:00,d93mn7n,6.0,t1_d9327ho,32851.0,Libertarian

71,"I'm interested in the libertarian answer to this too.  My guess would be some sort of proof-based reporting where there's an artificial tax-fueled market incentive for reporting where all evidence is documented and shared online (with usual viewer-based incentives on top of that, for making the information presentable).  This is why it's ironic that the best reporting these days seems to be organizations like the CBC and BBC, due to the public funding protecting real (principled) journalists from market forces and (some) top-down corruption.

PS: CNN, NPR, CNBC - all corrupt (pro Clinton at the moment), FOX notoriously corrupt (Republican side).  Really they're all just owned by whoever's trying to hide their stories and sway election results and can pay though.

Edit: nevermind, my idea's stupid.  It's not the initial finding of the material for good reporting that's hard - it's getting it to the mainstream viewer en-masse.  As long as market forces both force companies to report what's profitable and enable them to make backdoor deals for additional profits (or losses, if the deals come from the company owner) in exchange for content control, there's no platform that will report certain stories that everyone will see, unless they're profitable AND they're not going to piss off the benefactors.",2016-10-22 08:46:23+00:00,d92ux4i,2.0,t1_d92dt52,37032.0,Libertarian

83,"Saved.  This is exactly what I've been thinking lately, finally put into perfect words.  I've been looking around expecting people to care about all the Clinton corruption, about the very levers of democracy being taken away from the people so someone who ""knows better, who has experience"" can take charge and win against the the ""bad guy"".  I thought that the problem was people just didn't know it or believe it, but after an argument with some close friends on the wrong side I realized: it's because people don't care.  They really are so used to it being an oligarcy, or at the least two tribes battling, that they really don't care that the people themselves have little say anymore - or are so easily manipulated.  They think its so self-evident that the people are too stupid to have any real choice that they're actually happy these oligarchs are making the decisions - or at the very least, they don't see how they could or should stop them.  There's no better future to imagine.  There's maybe a candidate with less corruption - because that's embarrassing and weak, and a sign they may be a mean leader - but other than that they're happy to accept anyone who can take over the government and propagandize the media as much as they want, as long as they don't rock the boat too much.  They don't believe in people - never did.  The elites will handle it.

This is the real core of what I suspect the majority of democrats actually believe, if you can drag it out of them.  It boils down to this: Is the problem with the world that people are stupid, or that the system is corrupt?  (Or somewhere along the spectrum?).  And those who support Hillary have wholeheartedly answered: because people are stupid.  To me, that's terrifying.  Because how do you ever climb ouf of that?  The people themselves dont believe in their own power.

I mean, obviously it's both and a chicken/egg sorta problem, so - let's say theyre partially right -how should the system work to deal with it?  I find this oligarcy system so disgusting I imagined that everyone must see it that way, but if we had direct democracy - would it really be better at this rate?  Certainly not with the state of the media these days - able to convince enough people by sheer volume of screen time who to vote for.  Beneath all the outrage at how a system like this can still exist, perpetuating power in a select (undeserving) few through a ritual of social legitimacy, one has to wonder if we're even right about people being able to handle real power and choice?

Personally: yes.  yes we fucking can.  Even the majority of Trump supporters are a lot smarter than we give them credit for.  We might fuck up, but NEVER on the scale of evil that's been done in the past, and we'd learn - we'd get so much better and more united and engaged in our actual society if we just HAD A SAY.

89,"Well, nobodys saying ""pick something other than IRV or dont bother at all"", but it's hard to escape the reality that voting reform is rare and any change is going to take several elections to get used to -lettalone reformed further.  It's much more likely a bad change results in public support for changing the system back to the old FPTP way - which is a disaster if so.

Range and Approval have fewer real-world-politics examples (but are everywhere in the *real*-world.  see most online rating systems), but few systems have many.  I suspect its the philosophical difference - people are used to ""one man one vote"" and interpret that as ""either my vote goes to this guy, or this guy, or this guy..."" so IRV is the first thing they think of.

I'm in Canada, we've got a committee working to recommend a voting reform system by december.  I submitted a brief and attended the local open mic.

109,"&gt;I already replied to this, not sure if to you or someone else. I said that only one problem would be solved by expanding the space of IDs and that's solving the hashes for all possible IDs. There's still the problem of solving individual hashes that this wouldn't address.

Ah, thank you, I hope you'll forgive my misunderstanding.  And there's no way to tie the decryption of individual hashes to the decryption of the combined hash because if you could do so then you wouldn't be able to access them with a single keypair.

What if we just required a pair of keypairs though?  All voters must have two accounts - both are secret, you require the private keys of both to unlock either.  Guessing passwords just became exponentially harder (2^n, or n^2 I'm not sure) while the password length just became twice as long.  Repeat * t til keylength m = n*t is reached (not sure what complexity is of the top of my head.  Somewhere &gt;= n^t though).  Now each user gets three accounts to vote from, which they can build UI's over to hide it as one or use the three differently - up to the voting system.  Final result: exponentially increased complexity to guess any particular account, for linearly increased password size.  How is that either not possible or solvable in a reasonable amount of time? 

&gt; No, because then we introduce a vulnerability by allowing someone to poison the poll with fake votes.

Wouldn't this solve the expansion problem as well since if you double the number of Votes you just double the IDs per person too?

&gt;Yes, it would be anonymous to someone who didn't had the key. There are still two problems here caused by the fact that it wouldn't be anonymous to someone with the key: the government has all the keys and someone could coerce you into giving them your key. Remember, you don't have to address just the problem of selling votes for favors but also the problem of ""selling"" votes for things like not getting beat up. You have to consider dozens or hundreds of millions of people who live in all kinds of places around all kinds of people. In Romania people sold their votes (paper votes) for 10 EUR. People with lost of money bought lots of votes. Think about that: a million votes would cost only 10 million EUR. That's pocket change compared to the power one could gain with a million votes.

One problem at a time.  But yeah I admit that's a very difficult issue - even if we can solve the private key anonymity problem.",2016-10-09 04:00:49+00:00,d8k2xi6,19.0,t1_d8jysyy,7042.0,Futurology

111,"So you're saying it's impossible since we aren't able to solve the (pure-digital) Sybil attack problem without breaking anonymity?  More specifically: creating one account id per person is impossible without an attacker either being able to create multiple fake accounts or link them to the people they're issued to (in a reasonable amount of time)?

If so, why exactly can't accounts be issued from a large enough space that deciphering them can't be done in a reasonable time? (a rebuttal above said hiring 1000 amazon servers for a day would crack the account links - why can't they just be hashed with larger password domains to outpace the decryption?  

And if you're right and it is impossible to do this without essentially replicating physical ballots: isn't it still an improvement if it enables people to create a voting id that can be renewed every few years (or when they feel paranoid) instead of having to show up in person for every single vote? 

And isn't the core problem here really just Identity? If everyone had a public id (with a private secret password) that is guaranteed to be unique (one per person - probably government issued) wouldn't we be able to do your grab-bag solution anonymously?  I mean, sure - people could show each other their accounts and their votes after (and e.g. sell their votes) but couldnt it be anonymous to anyone without their secret key at least?  Is there no cryptographic mechanism that can take a domain of Voter Keypairs and Identity Keypairs of the same size, match the two to each other, and verify that all keys were matched exactly once *without* revealing the exact mapping?  Are you saying that map is **always** reverse-calculable in a reasonable amount of time?  We can't just increase the domain of both with fake vote keys and id keys by a factor of 100000? (I maybe get it - those wouldn't be fake.  But the passwords to actually use them could still be blind-generated with huge nigh-unguessable keys, right?

113,"Oh wow thank you - I'm glad you appreciated the post!

I'm afraid I have neither the evidence nor philosophical skill to substantively link religion to modernism et al, and I meant those more as allegorical characterizations of each outlook.  Although, I do associate the two in terms of eras: modernism was most prevalent during a time when monotheism was still the overwhelming norm, postmodernism when many of society's norms were being heavily questioned (in the 60s and onwards in the US) including religion and existence of God, and post-postmodernism reflects the spirituality movement that grew from that upset.  But I think the three stances can apply to religion or a-religion just as appropriately:  Modernism is classic monotheism in religion, but can be an atheistic positivist stance that the world is systematic and understandable - with no God needed - as well.  Postmodernism could be more of a ""we're all gods"" stance  - or we're all animals.  Post-postmodernism could be an ""All gods are cut from the same fabric"" stance or a ""Though we're all just animals, we're united by language, culture, and a common consciousness"".  

In that sense, I'm pretty sure the three can be applied to nearly anything.  Choice of ice cream:  the modernist believes there's only one correct scale and Macadamia Rocky Road is the top, the postmodernist has his personal preference but knows there is someone out there who likes Earwax flavored ice cream and his preference is every bit as true, and the post-postmodernist would probably posit that though the Earwax and Macadamia Rocky Road lovers appear completely opposite if they were in each other's shoes they'd see where the other was coming from and admit they share a commonality of taste.",2016-10-03 20:59:33+00:00,d8cn402,,t1_d8ci6rb,6118.0,philosophy

Your OP did its part, like the first line of a case.  Even with the context of the whole forum, of your whole *life*, you place it on the chopping block when you create a new topic and preach just the first form of a case.

Embrace or not.

Wanna downgrade from preacher to teacher?  Show your sources!

&gt;Zen teaches not falling into causality, not ignoring causality.

Your source - Wansong:

&gt;Not falling into cause and effect is forced denial, a nihilistic view; not being blind to cause and effect is finding the wonderful along with the flow.

What's the context?  Why should I agree?  It sounds like gospel, and it sounds like a single statement with one interpretation of right and wrong.  I dunno, man.  I don't see no Zen.  But it doesn't quite disagree with me either.

&gt;Baizhang is the master in the fox case. Huangbo is clever but not there yet. The fox monk in Baizhang's story is not enlightened.

Now, why do you have to say that?  Can the verse not speak for itself as to who the master and the enlightened are?  (But note: it doesn't.  There are controversies pinning it, according to the fox case wikipedia article.  Know why? because it's artfully written to preserve the multiplicity of interpretations!!!  Jumping on the one you like most isn't helping anyone - especially yourself.  Also note, that's the ol' Dogen interpretation so key to everything else he preaches.  What are your thoughts on ol' Dogen?)

Quote, wikipedia:

&gt;Traditionally, interpretations since the time of the Mumonkan have stressed the nonduality of the two understandings of causality expressed within the case. Dōgen, regarded by Sōtō adherents as the founder of their practice, recast the kōan in the later part of his life as an affirmation of the fundamental importance of acknowledging cause and effect. The significance of this debate goes to fundamental issues in Buddhist thought, especially the meaning of enlightenment with respect to cause and effect.

Pretty sure that's what I noticed, as an off-the-cuff reaction to the fact that I don't see Zen in your bland interpretation, but I see it in the case still.  Didn't know this was all controversial before that, but I can see why.

You can butter me up about how I follow causality like a sane man instead of that scary ol' ewk who can't say two words and admit they're connected - but I'm just following ordinary mind.  I don't care about your causality debate, or even these cases (I hadn't read them in a while - totally forgot how they went!) - I just reacted to what you posted (yep, sparked my ""preacher"" alarm).  But you are a-preachin'!  Look!

&gt;""Not falling into causation."" Why was he turned into a fox? ""Not ignoring causation."" Why was he released from the fox body? If you have an eye to see through this, then you will know that the former head of the monastery did enjoy his five hundred happy blessed lives as a fox.
&gt;
&gt;Not falling, not ignoring:
&gt;Odd and even are on one die.
&gt;Not ignoring, not falling:
&gt;Hundreds and thousands of regrets!

Once again, Wumen preserves the multiplicity.  Man had *style*.

It's like this verse:

&gt;The Layman was sitting in his thatched cottage one day [studying the sūtras]. ""Difficult, difficult,"" he said; ""like trying to scatter ten measures of sesame seed all over a tree."" ""Easy, easy,"" Mrs. Pang said; ""like touching your feet to the ground when you get out of bed."" ""Neither difficult nor easy,"" Ling Zhao said; ""on the hundred grass tips, the great Masters' meaning.""

You're just picking the ""Neither difficult nor easy"" as the *correct* answer to the problem of causality and proselytizing it.  Quit it - it's weird and pushy.  Just go for Zen and quit being such a crusader teacher preacher!",2016-09-17 18:15:20+00:00,d7qseiv,20.0,t1_d7qa8ay,43406.0,zen

Say what you will, you play the teacher.  Ain't my teacher.  Ain't a particularly responsible teacher either - agitating the water with your interpretations that come before the text.

I wasn't aware I had to stand anywhere - it should be self-evident.  ""Causality"" in the cosmic sense of *everything causal* is something I don't hold to though - show me everything first, and then you can show me everything's causal.

There's no picking and choosing in Zen, there's no ""sides"" to stand behind.  There is what is - what stands and what doesn't.  Someone more artful than yourself gets to the heart of this through showing, not telling, because they realize they're forcing an unwanted element into the conversation - their own opinion, their own beliefs, their own interpretation that pays no respect to the multiplicity of interpretations.

Mockery is sometimes kindness.  I learned to mock long before I found Zen, and I learned sincerity long before that.  The Zen masters don't just mock - they show ultimate kindness.  Where did you learn to lead?  To guide?  To ""help others""?  Where in the Zen texts do they talk about doing that?  When did you think you were doing something *good*?  If you can't show people what you want them to believe - and only tell - then why do you keep taking up the mantle?  You're being just another preacher, sharing The Word.  That's fine - everyone preaches from time to time, sometimes accidentally.  I preached partially in these responses because I'm not artful or practiced enough to avoid doing so all the time in long writing, though I try to avoid it in meaning.  But the preaching itself - it ain't Zen.  If anything, Zen is noticing the preaching.

Here's a shot:  The eye discerns.  Gaining the eye is tough.  Almost as tough as explaining the eye once one has it.  The eye is never lost, though it may not always be seen through.  Seeing through it is like seeing through sky.  Difficult, difficult.  Easy, easy.  Not difficult, not easy.",2016-09-17 04:16:10+00:00,d7q7e38,14.0,t1_d7q5ids,3740.0,zen

The Nazi rejection of art that degenerated from the accepted norm is exactly what I mean by Modernism - it's having a culturally-accepted norm of beauty, where any deviation is considered ugly in a fundamental way.",2016-09-10 19:29:18+00:00,d7ha0ua,3.0,t1_d7h14ky,13380.0,philosophy

204,For truth to be unknowable if it exists it must exist?  I think I meant the postmodernists - at best - believe that Truth is subjective and objective truth doesn't exist or will never be experienced.  It's easier to see this opinion in terms of morality: I think you'd be hard pressed to find a postmodernist that believes there is a single universal morality.,2016-09-09 23:10:18+00:00,d7gb5hc,7.0,t1_d7g6fkn,7023.0,philosophy

207,"Thank you for this - I would have written the same thing, though not nearly as well.

As for the rest:

Just to clarify I wasn't giving a rigorous definition but rather a pastiche impression or characterization.  As the terms I was throwing around:

Victorianism - the pre-1950s culture that considered certain social values to be Good that everyone must aspire to.  Moreover, they applied this universal Goodness to everything in life.  Those who could not aspire to such values were simply not as Good. This is just Modernism on society.

Religion - at least monotheistic religion - similarly purports one Good which followers must either aspire to or are heathens.  Modernism in spirituality.

Rationalism - There is a best practice (the most rational) that is sometimes impossibly hard to even determine but it's there (the rational Truth).  The (Victorian-era scientists were big into this too).  Modernism in intellectual pursuit.  (Note: I'm bastardizing ""rationality"" here by making ""rationalism"", the quazi-religion aka ""Science!"" that solves everything by just being really really really smart andyoushouldtoo!)

Positivism - basically what I just said above. ""Science!"" that throws away metaphysics because it believes the universe is solveable and we're just not done yet.  Modernism in metaphysics.

As for hipsterism - /u/technicalthrowaway caught it nicely.  Thanks!

Hope that makes my characterization clearer.",2016-09-09 20:43:58+00:00,d7g54po,4.0,t1_d7femp0,44326.0,philosophy

You probably disagree with that, in which case the argument for it is going to be too long and I might as well just point you to someone who can give it better than I.  I was loose with those definitions (which is why I call them characterizations) because I was trying to give the overall pastiche impression of each rather than a rigorous definition.",2016-09-09 20:12:10+00:00,d7g3oog,3.0,t1_d7fi2ya,30792.0,philosophy
210,"Interesting, it sounds like you're giving a postmodernist-angled critique - skeptical that individual subjective experiences can ever lead to Truth - in which case it's a long and difficult argument to say properly, and make the leap from pomo to post-pomo.  It's easier to see it if you're talking about a Platonic Good rather than Truth, but I got greedy in my definitions without including the arguments that Good is above Truth - but I digress.  Gist of the argument as I understand it is that experiences may be wildly different but there are clear commonalities.  A class reading each others essays may disagree on some, but overall there's often a common consensus on the best ones.  Though everyone may have their own subjective aesthetic, the overlap is conspicuous (particularly when the subjects share a common experience - e.g. a class, a culture, a common understanding of the medium).  One can neither exaggerate that every opinion is completely different (even with completely opposite lives.  postmodernism critique) nor say there is one single aesthetic that is being approached - because you will always find counterexamples (modernism critique).  

That's the shortened argument for Good.  Applied to Truth, it's that at some level you always have to rely on statistical sampling to say anything about reality.  If that class of people were instead conducting an experiment - they may get different values, but they'll likely have a commonality.  Theyre different, even in as controlled an environment as you can get, because theyre each different experiences which inevitably deviate and at the smallest level the world is effectively random (in relation to our ability to measure it.  modrrnism critique). It's still irresponsible to say they're all completely different though and there's no common Truth that's being reached towards through each experiment (postmodernism critique).  

I however rrally shouldnt take it upon myself to defend post-postmodernism here though as I doubt I can do it justice and it's imo a very difficult one to make that takes the slow arguments of long, well-written books (my gateway was Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, but I'm sure there are others).  So take the above as an incomplete cliffnotes version of one of the arguments - or just leave it and look into postpomo yourself.",2016-09-09 20:04:17+00:00,d7g3bx8,3.0,t1_d7fi59c,30158.0,philosophy

218,"Interesting critique!  Glad you liked the first two.  I wonder where in the post-postmodernism characterization I start to lose you?  You might be right in that I'm describing the path away rather than the destination - but to be honest I haven't quite read much that really *gets there* (also, it's easier to describe each of these as a rejection of the previous norms).  Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (&amp; sequel) was the core of my post-postmodernism path, but I reckon you took another and we might end up describing the same thing here once I see what perspective you're coming from (which would be an example of [my conception of] post-postmodernism in itself! haha).  I'll take a shot though - looking at the New Materialists description, I see a common thread to what I consider ""post-postmodernism"" in that there's a new branch of ethics (re: common meaning) being explored that's neither the unified collective top-down one-size-fits-all ethics of modernism nor the individualist free-for-all of postmodernism.  Looks like they emphasize non-human perspectives and such too, which I don't know much about but I can see how that would be a byproduct of looking for meaning after a postmodern world.  I wonder what you would characterize it by in terms of the mannerisms and - I dunno - general style of post-postmodernism?",2016-09-09 07:32:25+00:00,d7fdnvs,3.0,t1_d7fbivq,5994.0,philosophy

224,"I'm gonna respond to this because I don't think most people commenting so far understand what's meant by ""post-postmodernism"" vs ""objective truth"" - though it may fall on deaf ears so low in the comment thread.  This is just as I understand it.

So to begin, ""Modernism"" in this context isn't just a reference to the pre-1950s cultural stance (or the ""Victorians"") but a philosophical belief that there were correct answers to everything; that the world had a knowable structure - made evident by science - which extended from the practical (math, physics, engineering) into the social (art, society, social class, philosophy).  This was the belief that there were objectively-beautiful, objectively-correct things (a fine landscape painting, a perfect mathematical equation) which are aspired towards (but not necessarily reached - we don't know everything about the universe *yet*) and recognizable by anyone who isn't deviated from the Correct Way.  It's been called ""positivism"", it's been called religion, it's been called rationalism, but it's basically: belief that one way of looking at the world is the Right Way that finds the Truth and anyone who doesn't see it has simply deviated somehow - and if they correct themselves they will see it too.  (The philosopher should beware of Science!-ism that pushes such a view).  It is characterized by honour, dignity, respect, rationality, precision etc.

""Postmodernism"" is a rebuttal to Modernism, often characterized by artistic movements in mediums that break the conventional Modernist aesthetic and do ""weird"" things (this happens in almost every medium at some point). Philosophically, it's the belief that there is no Objective Truth - that each person experiences the world in his/her own way that's equally as True as the next.  It sees ""science"" as merely one interpretation of the world amongst many - which is useful when in sterile environments applicable to the experiment conditions, but often falls apart when applied to one's own experience in every aspect.  It rejects science as a source of absolute Truth and meaning, but it also rejects any other source - as it recognizes that at best Truth is relative and subjective, as people will never be able to experience the world in exactly the same way.  It's related to ""nihilism"" (at least the popular interpretation of it), the Christian Purgatory, and is often called ""meaninglessness"". Religion-wise, it's closest to atheism or agnosticism (or satanism etc, for a stronger rejection of oppressive rationality).  (A scientist who recognizes his work is interesting within the scope of his field but does not believe in its universal applicability to the real world - who sees it like writing one novel amongst many - may be a postmodernist).  It is characterized by irony, individuality, intentional weirdness, rejection of the norm, hipsterism etc.

""Post-Postmodernism"" is the debateable followup to Postmodernism.  Often it is just mistaken for Postmodernism, because it still claims no Objective Truth and accepts that all Truth must be experienced subjectively through the lens of culture and there are many equally-valid Truths.  However, it rejects the ""meaninglessness"" aspect of postmodernism where just because everything is subjective there is no collective Truth to aspire to.  It sees Truth rather as a dynamic, living thing that can take many forms but isn't just equal everywhere - that each person can aspire to experience meaning, and this meaning can be shared with others even if they come from a totally different subjective reality.  It recognizes that the cultures of the world are diverse in detail but similar in their cores - that people may experience Truth completely differently, but they are looking at different reflections of the same light.  Applied to science, it's recognizing that many pieces (if not most) of our collective understanding are flawed and nobody can possibly understand it all; that any understanding is just one interpretation amongst many - and it isn't Truth in itself and never will be - but it still all points to the Truth (in useful, replicable ways).  It recognizes that only being able to point at the Truth is an inherent limitation of language - but it's there - and it can be found from a variety of different ways (a poet and a physicist may each have their own way of seeing it).  The meaninglessness of Postmodernism is brought back as a depressing hopelessness - but a necessary step to take away from modernism - while the authority of Modernism is brought back as just one (often sterile and limiting, but culturally conventional) path to the Truth.  (As for what Truth is, that's for each person to discover for himself).  Religion-wise, it's closest to paganism, God Pantheons, Tarot cards, and multiplicity of meaning - but with an emphasis on meaning existing.  Its characteristics are tougher to see as it's rarely the majority philosophy of any culture, but: authenticity, individual aspiration (""following your heart""), openness to adventure and new experiences, comfort with limited structure, etc may be recognizable attributes.

So as you can see, post-postmodernism is somewhat of the blend of the previous two and hard to distinguish.  There are theories that societies tend to cycle through each of these - and that the multiplicity of meaning to post-postmodernism may eventually be encompassed into some new philosophical structure and become the new Modernism.  Positivists who think the universe can be knowable and objective are often more than happy to try and accept that multiple subjective interpretations of the world fit into their model (and thus aim for that new modernism out of post-pomo) - but I think they'd be hard-pressed to explain the precise point where their model leaves the constraints of language and describes the world in itself in such scenarios.  But I digress - I just wanted to share these rough definitions/characterizations so anyone interested in this stuff has a nice jumping-off point.  I think these three represent the major stages of our culture (of any culture!  I have an interesting headcanon of how TwitchPlaysPokemon went through them) and make for useful concepts to play with.

252,"I see what you're saying.  I disagree with the severity of it, or the moral ""wrongness"" of it - mostly due to this being Zen where the typical ideals of kindness get torn up frequently, especially when they're used to cushion someone in their own crazy hut.

Ewk does a very good job of tearing down those crazy huts.  Specifically - pointing out Zen from Buddhism.  And it's a thing that needs doing, since at least 90% of popular ""Zen"" ain't Zen.  He also has a stick up his butt about it, and is more concerned with preventing people from adding renovations to the Zen hut than ""helping people"", but thankfully there are people like yourself to do so!  

&gt;Once you say henhouse you're defining what that means. And you're saying that he's chasing false people away, and you're saying that he's not false.
Not quite - he can be just as false now and then.  As can anybody.  Thus the Benny-Hill chase scenes we keep seeing around here.  I do enjoy the laughs, but I somehow doubt those really help - but what is one to do, when pulled into the undertow of karma?

&gt;As to damaging people, you have a lot of people arriving with intense experiences, whether its from taking LSD, or because they are awakening spiritually and having non dual moments, or they are seeking out of depression, or intellectualism. It doesn't matter.  Many people are vulnerable. And, they find the Zen texts.

Which is all the more reason not to get them mixed-up in crazy-hut extensions and chains-upon-chains, like at least half the regular posters in here espouse.  If they get their hand slapped by an overzealous school teacher now and then it's not the end of the world.

&gt;If you come here looking to learn more about Zen and have conversations about it, and are confronted with someone telling you to AMA, read a book, and attacking you for being a troll, attacking you for having learned things in other traditions, attacking you for having read buddhism, and then you are attacked for wanting to talk about it, that's bad. If you're berated for it, and especially if you are berated with arguments that do not correspond to what is in the texts themsleves you can be damaged.

This response is just writing itself now.  Every ""AMA!"", ""Read a book!"", or accusation of trolling I've witnessed (without additional details giving precise answers of why they were wrong) has been to someone who persistently pushed some Dogenesque extra zaniness spouting it as Zen and got angry when told the Lineage Texts didn't reflect them.  Also, ""attacked"" is a strong word.  Poked, prodded, berated maybe even. But come on.

&gt; Even the fact that you're saying ""don't go chasing waterfalls"", talking about the name on the door, describing it as a coop, all of this is because of the one alpha dog who has set those patterns. And none of them have anything to do with what is in the texts.

Come on.  Zen and Not Zen isn't an ewk invention - though it is his industry.  

But overall I guess I just don't share your deep fear for humanity's fragility that one dick telling people when they're making stuff up is going to break their little minds (certainly not the repeat posters - those soldiers know what they're getting into).  If we're going by ""right and wrong"", it's more right to have him here knocking down walls than worrying about the fragile occupants.   And if you don't like it, why not be the one to catch them and slowly hold their hand through their delusion-destruction instead of just being yet another ewk pesterer with no substance when questioned other than ""he doesn't warn people not to ignore causality"".

You worry about a false God King, but you're becoming quite the vocal little Prince yourself here.   One has to wonder if all this wisdom you're so eager to dispense comes at a cost.  Beware the well-meaning, they say.  I think it's much easier to see the danger in a grumpy bear-king who yells at people to read a book than this new Hero who says *almost* all the right words and calls on the townsfolk to follow him hunting.  

But whatever, ewk doesn't need a defense and nobody needs him.  It's just perplexing to see you so tied up in it.   Then again, here I am too - adding to the spectacle",2016-09-06 00:35:03+00:00,d7awh03,17.0,t1_d7au1sk,4017.0,zen

Eh, hearsay for me.  I reckon ignore ""causality"", don't go chasing waterfalls maybe.

Where did you get all these tools from?  What's the point?  Ewk calls ""ewk ewk ewk"" to the birds that pester him when they're ignoring the rest of what is said.  It would be a different thing if he was the one chasing them to scream their names - but he tends to find something else to scream at.  Who chased who first? - I'll never know - no patience for comment histories.  Who cares.  See what's being said.

""secular"", ""religious"" - as I've seen, just tearing up of ""magic"" and indoctrination.  If you're concerned that there's nothing magical (magicky? special? pretty?) left, well - he tears up ""causality"" too, so it's an even playing field.  

Still don't know why this ""subject-object split"" gets all your attention, but I digress.  These are all tools of language, none of them pointing to concepts that are Zen, so why are they so important?  Why is it you always seem to have something to say about Zen, but only after copious back-and-forths with someone else taking away each of your toys (which to your credit, you seem to gladly give away - albeit temporarily).  Ewk always has something to say about Zen, but he doesn't play with such toys.  Much less fun but always an answer and usually short &amp; sweet.  No cult, just an eye.

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (HPMOR) takes the Harry Potter universe, asks what would happen if Harry was raised with a science background and intellectual curiosity, and sets him loose.  Ravenclaw, extreme time turner mechanics, evil genius Voldemort, unfettered transfiguration, magical army training, and more.  Only slight hesitation to recommendation is the author may come across as smug at times.  It is worth it though, especially because of the spinoff fanfics that arose from it - particularly Following the Phoenix (my favorite), Significant Digits (exceptional too, on a world scale), and Draco Malfoy and the Practice of Rationality (addicting too, very Slytherin-y).
You may want to check out [other stories like HPMOR](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3f9gly/list_of_stories_similar_to_hpmor/) too.  Pokemon: Origin of Species, in particular has been quite good so far, though it's just starting out (Cerulean city).

Main non-fanfic recommendation though - and one of the best reads of my life:  [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/).  Absolutely fantastic realism/gritty/grounded superhero story in its own world where thousands of people gain powers every year.  Superbly written, good characters, addicting stories, almost-mystery-style revealing of plot elements, fulfilling payoff, but so freaking long you may be at it for months.

Then your privilege just shines through - and you start sounding really White Power.  You can't say you're about individual autonomy and then say people shouldn't have abortions when they need them (I hate to wonder what you think of rape-response abortions), or that everyone who wasn't born with the same advantages as you should just suck it up.  Theres a brand of libertarianism that believes in personal freedom and autonomy tempered by offsetting initial disadvantages.  You wouldn't just leave people in wheelchairs to fend for themselves,  and similarly you don't leave a high financial burden on one gender just because theyre the ones who have to buy the birth control to prevent an even larger burden they may not be able to provide enough care for (certainly not in your world where undoubtedly child support programs have been gutted.  I wonder what happens to orphaned kids).  And dont go saying that's on the girl not being a ""cumdumpster"" (watch your language, that is fucking shameful) when there are countless incidents where girls have trusted the guy and thought he would be an equal part of the burdens (of birth control or family) and he walked out - it is not an easily predictable risk, and it's bad enough without it creating a huge financial burden because the state doesn't want to help.  I'm also extremely skeptical that even costs much of the federal budget to support.  There's probably some compromise solution there like an insurance industry but I digress.

Long story short: your beliefs would actually be largely supported by ""liberals"" who hate the system if you'd drop the sexist (and probably by extension of those ideas, racist) stance that everyone should just ""got theirs"" and be autonomous, ignoring the problem that people are often not at all on equal footing to begin with and you're leaving a systemic disadvantage that specifically white male christians benefit from most.

We could de-facto give Bernie as much power by being in charge of this movement as Hillary's presidency.  It's worth continuing the fight.  This is like losing any primary - corrupt, should-have-been-won, but we mourn and carry on.

I'd like to see - if we do manage to pull together, and we do manage to do what Sanders says and support Hillary - an extremely ""practicality only""-vibed sort of support, where we make it 100% clear on every call that we advocate Hillary only as the best current means towards getting the progressive values we want in the upcoming vote.  No excitement, full honesty, appeal to intelligence and console voters that the decision is an awful one - but if they're looking for hope, come to the Sanders sub and see the political tide that's rising.  It won't change this election, but it may change every one after it.  I feel like if we did this honestly and begrudgingly we'd be nearly as successful (who the hell CAN be excited about this choice?) while taking the fire out of future Trump insults and paving the way for the actual wave of change.  Just get everyone on the same page - our page.  To not do so would be giving up, and letting them destroy us.

321,"Electoral reform to use Approval Voting or anything that doesn't perpetuate 2-party dominance (Range Voting or Proportional Representation being even better).  Til then voters are at the mercy of the Democrats and Republicans.  If their primaries used Approval voting they'd be very different too: Sanders might have done far better (as plenty of people approve of both but many strongly disapprove of Clinton), and Trump's initial lead would have been far lower (as many of the candidates would have gotten similar approval ratings rather than people having to pick one - which favors the most famous candidate).

We should start using an internal voting system that follows this, and that enables Delegative Voting - where you can choose representatives recursively, your vote adding to their vote.  Due to Sybil Attacks (bots creating fake accounts) this is a difficult thing to keep fair, but some tech solutions are just starting to surface involving cryptocurrencies.  If we research into that and jump on a good system, we would both act as a killer app to kick it off the ground and we'd get to experiment with direct democracy.

327,"Glad to hear!  I agree, I think we'll see some huge activity as CA and the convention draw near and [less engaged] people come around to the idea of making a big show for Bernie rather than just lying down and letting Clinton have her coronation. 

This is somewhat of an oddball idea but I wonder if there might be a greater variety of volunteer tasks needed than the current crop.  At this point if you don't have a suitable environment/lifestyle/social-skills for frequent phonebanking, don't live nearby an event, and already facebanked your network there's not much else obvious to do.  It seems to me a lot of people probably have plenty of computer time to give (at work or procrastinating on work) but can't or would rather not use it for loud things like phonebanking. Just having those people contribute on other tasks - like knowledge acquisition / reporting - could be a very interesting compromise.

For instance, maybe we could start assembling some amateur reporting teams, researching into things like mainstream media bias &amp; funding by compiling arguments/events as evidence against them, researching their funding network and pinpointing the most corrupt or honest individuals - that kinda thing. Much of this would take just filling in a Wiki and a lot of slow investigative work, but if broken down into smallish tasks a big swarm of volunteers could do it pretty effectively.  The results could then be verified and handed to a second Media Team who takes them and makes them into short presentations (Youtube video, Bernie-favoring-celebrity Tweets, etc) so they can get notoriety and get passed through the network.  Essentially, we'd be using our massive network to bring attention to the topics we want to *ourselves* rather than relying on mainstream media's reporters.   It's a very ambitious task, but I wonder if it's occurred to anyone else.  We'd also ideally want someone (perhaps a full-time professional from the official campaign?) spearheading it who has led big teams professionally before and can handle the pressure.

Other topics include:

1) Vetting congressional hopefuls for dirt/corruption (or likely future corruption) so we know who to support on /r/GrassrootsSelect .  For those that pass the bar, providing these volunteer resources to their campaigns to help them know how to win

2) Demographic and local issues analysis.  Not as sure how this would work, but I imagine it takes a lot of manpower to figure out what people care about on the local level in the states Bernie's moving into or the districts the above congress hopefuls are operating in.  A swarm of eyes and ears could help compile that and get it to those that can use it.

3) A general on-the-spot knowledge provider service - where volunteers can ask urgent questions and get quick research.  This would be more of an on-call service

4) Research into the current workings of congress, analyzing the bills being passed and dumbing them down into the need-to-knows for anything we can protest or take action on.  Essentially making the acts of congress accessible to the progressive (and suspicious) viewpoint without relying on mainstream media (some other media should really be doing it, but who? TYT?)

5) An on-demand Ask A Berner service so people curious about Bernie can just directly talk in chat with Bernie supporters.  (This must exist already, but I haven't seen it)

But in summary: anything that seems daunting to 1-2 professionals but easy for a swarm of amateurs is something we can and should be doing for the campaign. Something tells me there's much more that needs doing than just phonebanking, and I think we'd gain a new class of volunteer who's willing to work on this kinda thing that wasn't before - especially if the system was gameified well.  You'd be actively helping the world just by being an internet nerd who researches things and shares his opinion: that's like the Reddit dream.",2016-05-12 04:54:03+00:00,d32bxf5,3.0,t1_d32723e,8872.0,SandersForPresident
328,"Let me speak in the language of the enemy:  /r/SandersForPresident is a brand.  Every brand can be marketed mainly for short-term gains or long-term gains.  Short-term involves creating a sense of urgency, excitement, panic, immediate value, fear of the competitor, and hyperbolic greatness of the brand.  Long-term involves a slower, more-honest, less-urgent, community-based connection with the customers - trying to build genuine trust and interest so those customers see it as quality.  

There are times for both.  Around the beginning, it was mostly all the long-term gains, and everyone who came here could quickly see just how high-quality Bernie was.  Then the challenges came, where we had to push like crazy, and we went for the short-term gains of Activism Mode.  That would be fine, except we never really went back.  And instead of splitting the brand into two subreddits so at least the long-term stuff could keep building on its own (e.g. /r/berniediscussion ) we capitalized 100% on every customer here, and never relented.

Putting this in another analogy: at first we tilled the soil and let things grow.  And it was damn good soil.  But then we kept harvesting and harvesting until it was almost devoid of life.  Instead of letting an ecosystem grow at its own pace we picked a power-crop and just grew-and-harvested it til oblivion.

We probably turned a lot of new people off of /r/SandersForPresident because they didn't feel like there was room for their voice in this subreddit due to all the activism and hyperbolic titles.  Not being able to post new threads, and not being able to vent or be concerned about the likelihood of Bernie's victory without being called a concern-troll likely turned off anyone wondering whether we were a bunch of extremists or not.  We didn't even manage to keep the negativity away, as trolls would just hop on Megathreads and post fast enough that they'd be seen no matter how many downvotes and reports they'd get.  As a result, we just looked authoritarian and unrealistic: not the image you want to create if you're trying to inspire either anti-establishment rebels (Trump supporters) or left-leaning pragmatists (Clinton supporters).

Regardless, what's done is done.  We will likely lose this election - that is the unfortunate truth - and we'll never know what could have happened if we played it differently.  Perhaps we just needed *more* Activism Mode? Who knows.   But going forward, I think we need to think longer term.  We need to let this place re-grow into a thriving community where we can branch out from purely focusing on the next goalpost into organizing a massive progressive movement to take back the country.  To do this, we need to have greater ability to participate in rational discussions that are allowed to be somewhat negative/pragmatic or stray from immediate concerns.  We need to be able to post inspiring ""fluff"" news even if it's not activism-related.  We need to help spread and share the media best talking about the issues we care about, and bring down the media sources that don't.  Whether Bernie wins or loses, we need to have a strong focus on congressional elections, perhaps merging with /r/GrassrootsSelect as soon as the election is over.  All this culminates in limiting Activism Mode - either to just a few stickied topics, or at most just a few days on the most urgent times, and overall following Bernie's lead of talking about the issues first and not getting swept-up by the competition.   We need to be a source of knowledge about what's wrong in America and how to change it, and inspire people to keep fighting for years to come - even if we don't get a President Sanders to spearhead it.  Making this sub do-or-die is a powerful sacrifice for short-term pushes, and it was probably needed at times, but it's a dangerous game to play for the long-term.",2016-05-11 20:31:54+00:00,d31sis7,1.0,t3_4iur0z,27617.0,SandersForPresident

332,"&gt;Nothing in there leads any objective observer to the belief that it's better, just that it's different.

No objective position exists on this topic.  You're making a choice in values.  That was an objective analysis in the sense that it's a relatively-unbiased accounting that shows pros and cons, yes.  But if you value a system that more-closely represents the people's desires, then that was evidence of MMP being one.  If you instead value a stronger power structure with a winner-take-all approach that creates majority governments even when there's not a majority in favor of them, then you probably like First Past the Post.  What are your values of a system, anyhow - now that we've come this far?

&gt;Honestly, this whole desire to have a King-like figure to look after the interests of the people is ancient and our government was specifically designed to prevent that sort of figure. And yet here we are.
Well, if the President's supposed to represent the states, then I don't see the difference in being a figure of the people too.  When his position was envisioned, governance was a lot more local too - with people mainly involved with their state.  The president simply being a leader chosen by the parties ruling those states makes sense in that case.  But with the modern scenario, where everything is hyper-globalized and you have news and internet media updates instantly, having everything fed through the same power structures seems ridiculous - especially when they're ""corrupt"" in the sense that their rules heavily favor their insider decisions vs the democratic choice.

Keep in mind this is a system which also neglects to check-and-balance the ""corporate arm"", which has used concentrated ownership of news media and campaign financing to ensure that nobody in ANY branch can get in without heavy corporate support and funding for advertisements.  We're only now beginning to overcome that imbalance with the internet and crowd funding.  The system doesn't make sense.  That the Executive branch is being seen as a position representing the soul of the people is not unexpected and not much of a deviation from the original intent of the office, imo.

And that this should be inherently tied to a two-party system, caused by First Past the Post, is laughable to me.  If your argument is that it's not the people being represented but the states, confining the state's choices to two parties - across the whole country - is also incredibly stupid.  Why should Wyoming have to choose between the Democrat and Republican parties when they both seem to care more about New York, and they're better represented by the MidWest party?  Same problem arises for those states as people: you're trapped into accepting a limited set of issues that poorly represent you just to avoid the other party that represents you even worse.  This is easily solved with replacing FPTP with Approval voting.",2016-05-04 23:19:22+00:00,d2t45l0,17.0,t1_d2t2p7h,2186.0,SandersForPresident

334,"Well, to be fair everything kills the middle class.  Capitalism moving to a more automation-based economy kills the middle class.  Corporate subsidies that don't create a proportional number of well-paid jobs kills the middle class.*  Big banks and hedge funds that mitigate their risk by becoming too big to fail and expecting government bail-outs kills the middle class.  Continuous systemic wealth inequality for 30 years that stops wages from growing at the same rate as corporate profit kills the middle class.

*With welfare subsidies that enable Wal-Mart to pay its workers less than a living wage included here.

Sure, Bernie may have a few typically-liberal stances like the above Free College Solves All, and a minimum wage increase that might push things too far (personally, I think it'll just cause corporations to roll out their automation that much faster.  Though some kind of pay increase *is* sorely needed, I prefer a Basic Income).  But Bernie's also fighting a very necessary battle against corporate interests strangling democracy.  If there's no force to work against corporate control, then the American people are truly doomed.  And I'd argue that - sure, some of the above has the risk of being expensive or unsustainable, but those are just goals for the right direction and are all things the people need.  Making them fiscally responsible and sustainable is part of the follow-through.

357,"So, conventional means of winning are looking almost extinguished.  There, I said it.

We need to figure out how we're going to react to this.  The hope is drying up fast - many people are going to either tune out of politics or think they have to begrudgingly vote Hillary.  But even if we're not going to get a delegate majority, the progressive movement is still very much alive.  We need to start talking grand strategy of: 

1) How to keep Bernie's support all the way up to the convention for maximal bargaining power (and a slim chance at a superdelegate saving grace - *highly unlikely*), 

2) What is truly the best strategy IF Hillary wins?  If we want the most Bernie-like candidate to lead the country, with enough support in congress to actually fix the country - what is the best strategy?  Voting Hillary means 2020 will be a very hard battle to oust her, with Republicans chomping at the bit to takeover too.  If, somehow, it was Trump though - now that would be interesting.  Out of panic, the democrats would sweep congress in November, preventing him from doing too much damage, and in 2020 he'd be a far easier incumbent to topple than Hillary - meaning the true race would be the Democrat primary, which Bernie (or his endorsed heir) would have a real shot at.  All this together, it sounds like a Trump win gives a far better shot at revolution in 2020 than Clinton.  This isn't my idea, but read it from someone on the sub and it strikes me as almost crazy enough to work.  Could it actually be better? 

3) I think we need to focus more on education - especially if Bernie has indeed lost.  Every one of his supporters needs to go down the full rabbit hole, and educate themselves on the corruption of the media, politics, and specifically the democratic party.  We can NOT lose this and have people walk away from politics thinking ""well, the more-left guy lost - guess I should probably vote for the most 'left' one left"".  They need to be aware of the systematic political trap that's been weaved out of the Democrat/Republican party system, so that even if we lose this attempt to break out - everyone remains vigilant for the next chance.  Some of you may think every Sanders supporter thinks this way.  Some of you may think this is borderline crazy conspiracy theory shit.  I say: those who know don't prove it, and those who don't see proof don't believe it.  Only a small subset of Sanders supporters see the full picture.  We need to make a serious effort to gather all the cases of electoral fraud, media bias, etc and make them easily digestible to the rest of the American public - especially those who are fresh converts or still Hillary supporters.  We should have been doing this for ages - but activism has overshadowed it a bit.  But the emphasis now needs to be on creating an informed public - who can see all the tricks the establishment uses and work together to escape them.  The internet's been great for this, and we're the nucleus of it all.  We can do better, though.

Any choice in voting system is a moral choice.  A voting system that best represents the wishes of its people is a pretty good moral metric though.  Alternatively, we could have a dictatorship - or yes, religious leaders because they're more stable and we like Strong Leaders.  Again, a moral choice.  I'd personally go with the system that most accurately represents the public opinion (Range voting), 4 year terms for now, but accessible methods for reform down the road for eventual online direct democracy participation.

361,"I actually really like this idea.

Not to try and derail anything - I'm no activism expert, and please nobody take too much out of this - but sometimes I wonder what things would look like if all the bernie activism and poll-watching was put into making and sharing quality media related to the underlying issues.   This sub has been great for deep discussions of the issues, but they're much harder to find since activism mode and I wonder if it's off-putting.  When both Twitter and here are much more shouting-matchey about the latest polls, scandals or Clinton attacks rather than into the issues, it seems counterproductive and even contrary to Bernie's original message.

It's an empty criticism, as I don't even really know what would change, but I just imagine this community as one that cares more about exploring the issues with well-researched articles and videos rather than the gotcha partisanship of mainstream media.  If we became more convincing and focused on how things should change if they could - with an emphasis on convincing some of the harder-nosed Clinton fans - maybe we'd see better results.  We could go state-by-state, bringing attention to the corruption and messed-up things party politics have caused.  It would just be a very interesting way to use such a plethora of engaged intelligent eyes - we seek out and reward the best journalists, writers, reporters and artists who can bring light to the issues in an unbiased manner.  Give anyone with important issues related to Bernie's a platform to share their stuff, and create a collection of sources for all the junk that needs fixing (with well-argued solutions).  Like a thousand little John Olivers.

Just an interesting thought.  I think/hope we do this already quite well - but it's never been a main focus.  The world camera's on us though - maybe we should point it to the issues more.

368,"Answered my own question somewhat:

Assuming each delegate roughly corresponds to the same % of the population (it doesn't but meh):

55 of the delegates are in odd districts, 108 in even.

So to win by over 50% in the 55 odd districts, while losing by less than 16.6% in the even districts, your total % of votes needs to be greater than 

    50/100 * 55/163
    + 41.667/100 * 108/163
    = 44.5%

And it would net a total of 86 to 77 (+9) , With the statewide delegates split 37 to 47 (-10), giving a narrow loss of -1 delegate: 123 to 124.

Still, not bad with only 44.5% of the popular vote.

By the sound of it, any more than that just takes raw popular vote - preferably in the 7 districts.  To gain one more delegate takes a win of over 57.14% in one of the 7-delegate districts.  That then needs a popular vote of 45.1%.  

**So: 45.1% popular vote needed for a tie under optimal delegate distribution conditions, assuming delegates are roughly proportional to population.**

370,"I agree, the electoral college is a mess, and FPTP systems are inherently flawed in that they force 2-party systems that poorly represent the population.  But as long as we're aiming to replace the system - I would not choose STV.  Approval or Range voting - especially if made into a proportional representation system - would be far better.

Here are all the arguments against STV:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issues_affecting_the_single_transferable_vote 

But to bring attention to the ones I think are most important: any STV system where you order your candidates best to worst and eliminate those with the lowest votes is open to some really weird voting strategy where it's optimal to choose candidates you know have no chance of winning as your first choices so they'll be eliminated and their vote will carry-on to your actual favorite.  Moreover, voting honestly can sometimes even hurt your preferred candidate - where they'd be better off if you didn't even vote.  Those are some weird paradoxes, and unnecessary.

http://www.rangevoting.org/CompChart.html

The far better - and simpler - system in my opinion is Approval voting: simply yay or nay for every candidate, rather than just one (FPTP).  It avoids these strategic voting weirdnesses and makes voting incredibly intuitive: just approve of who you like.

Range voting would be even better (give a score 0-10 for each candidate) but I suspect Approval would be a much more intuitive first-step into electoral reform for America as it barely even changes the ballot - but it would suddenly change the face of the entire race.  Just look at the Republican primary: if voters didn't have to choose only one candidate the landscape would be very different, as suddenly nobody's splitting each other's votes.  That's another thing this system solves (which STV doesn't) - third parties would no-longer be biased against strategically by the system.  People could vote for - say - the Green Party without hurting their vote for the Democratic Party, cultivating a multi-party system instead of an eternal cutthroat Democrat vs Republican face-off.

So yeah - I think voting system reform is incredibly important - both in America and most of the rest of the world - and more people should care about it.  It's great that you do.  And as long as you care - then you might as well take a look at the other systems too so we're fighting for the right one.  I'm fairly sure after many years looking into it that Approval / Range is the best way to go, but I'm a bit rusty on my sources and may not have been convincing enough yet.

Highlights/notes/ideas:

* survival-based now.  Can't grow food since zombies eat and tear up anything outside.
	- animals are eaten on the first night (for emotional scarring purposes), as well as any crops (for survival difficulty purposes).  greenhouse is destroyed, if available, since somewhat OP

- only your supplies can keep you going
- need to feed yourself and any other villagers, at least once per day
  - 3 days without food and someone has a chance to starve every day after
- can only grow food if it's surrounded by fences and the zombies are kept at bay
- each night they accumulate (pawing at the door, at the walls, at wherever), and gradually deteriorate your defenses
	- can break into your house if they get past your fortifications
- everyone is holed-up different places
	- Saloon: Gus, Pam, Shane, with shotguns
		- Shane of the Dead references
	- Kent the soldier takes care of his family
	- Adventurer dude is MIA.  Only his buddy with a rocking chair and a shotgun remains, but he doesn't say much.  Gives you a book he left detailing zombie defense
		- Find him deep in the mines, trying to stop the zombie plague.
	- trip to the Wizard tower: ""I am so sorry _Farmer_"", as he's ripped to shreds by a dark spell cast by an unknown entity (not the witch, too simple). He somehow started this or failed to prevent the beast from getting out.
	- trip to sewers: this is where they're coming from.  Zombies from the sludge.  Krobus is nowhere to be found.
		- maybe he, or his people, did it?
	- mines are overrun with skeletons and very powerful shit
		- dwarf is found dead, deep in the mines, whilst helping Adventurer dude
	- train doesn't run anymore, or comes by on fire(?)
	- TV indicates (in early days, before it's dead air after first week) that this is happening around the world
	- bus to escape (with Pam) runs into a mini quest where you hit a huge herd of zombies and have to fight your way to the roof of the casino, leaping to the skeleton cliff and back to the RV (with Sandy). Mr Qi stays behind to go down with the ship (big explosion behind you).
	- Clint, if secured, can fashion weapons and reinforced doors to help with defense
		- guns!
	- Willy catches his own food, and has barricaded the dock
	- Joja mart has been ransacked and the owner eaten.
	- Abigail and Caroline are in the store
		- Trade you seeds for supplies
	- Marnie still has animals and defends her shit well.  She's fine, but needs more resources like metal, hay and such. (will trade in exchange for animals. Expensive though).
	- Robin and co can fortify defenses, build safe barns etc for food and resources.	
	- sacred forest is free of zombies (pure) but has very powerful slimes/other monsters now
		- special zombie-cure ingredients here
	- Linus the hobo has developed a way to blend-in with the zombies, and can trade you for zombie-repellent (super costly though)
		- acts like a zombie too, so you think he's gonna eat you on first appearance
	
- walls can be placed anywhere, but always have a chance of being torn down.
- zombies are hard to fight.  They take a lot of hits, barely respond to pushback, and if you're bit you're done (but you get to live the rest of the day, become a zombie, and see the rest of your group get eaten).
- zombie cures are available later on as you discover how (adventurer guild + wizard tower combined knowledge + special ingredients, minimum)
- any/all of the 8 marriageable people (minus Harvey) can stay at your house with you, if it's large enough and they like you, and contribute to defense. They must be led safely to your place and won-over.
- all the usual friendship/love mechanics are in play still, though the cutscenes are all different.
- if anyone household's defenses are broken they fall back (if they can) and lose a person or two.  Sometimes you fight villagers in random encounters if they're zombies and haven't been killed yet
- if anyone's bit, they can infect the others unless treated or ""dealt with""
- rebuilding the greenhouse and keeping it defended, or keeping a fenced-off area of your fields defended, is the best way to grow crops to survive.
	- but it takes a lot of food to keep people going. You may have to decide who to help or not.  Not to mention travel is dangerous.
	- ore, metal etc are tough since mines are super dangerous now
	- wood is tough since you can't easily fence off areas indefinitely and there are lots of wandering zombies
	- same for forage
	- fishing's pretty good as long as you can secure a spot
- herds of zombies (i.e. big packs) come through periodically and severely test your defenses (i.e. need iron fences or better usually).  Sometimes they'll take out a town building if it's not well-stocked.
- endgame: deep in the mines is the lair of the dark spirit that killed the wizard and unleashed this all.  The adventurer dude dies to him.  Major-ass boss battle.  Defeat him and the zombie menace subsides.  
- new set of bundles from the community center to protect areas of the town, and/or revive the fallen if we're being really generous

You awaken bright and early to a crisp winter's day.  Snow softly falls upon your fields, dormant now as they await the promise of another year.  You head to the barn, tend your cattle, check your savings, and decide to visit Marnie's ranch to expand your herd by one more head - maybe you'll get another pig this time.  You could use some truffle oil to help out at the community center, after all.



You stroll down through the snow, eyes scouring for forage in the pristine forest, when you notice something.  A splash of red in the white snow.  You get closer, and examine the markings.

A chill runs down your spine, but you collect yourself and resolve to find out what happened.  After all, you've lived in this town for two years, and nothing bad has truly happened.  It must have been an accident.


You head East, to the town.  Villagers are meandering through the streets.  You ask Evelyn if she saw anything, and she replies:

""Ah yes, I saw Pierre running to the hospital looking like he'd seen a ghost!  He was clutching his arm...  Is he alright?""

You head up to the hospital, and enter to a scene.  Abigail, Caroline, Mayor Lewis and Harvey, the resident doctor, are crowded around a hospital bed where Pierre lies with a bandaged arm.

Harvey: ""Well Pierre, it looks like pretty bad dog bite, but I've cleaned and dressed the wound and I'm sure it'll heal in a few days.  Just stay off your feet for a while.""

Pierre: ""... Thanks Doctor...""

Caroline: ""Are you sure he'll be alright?  You never know what those things are carrying these days...""

Harvey: ""Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine.  But just to be sure, someone should stay with him tonight""



Overhearing this, you're faced with a choice: Offer to stay, or Stay Silent.

Offer to stay:

Mayor Lewis:  ""Oh, _Farmer_!  You're offering to stay with Pierre?  That's very thoughtful of you.""

Pierre: ""...""

Mayor Lewis:  ""But you have so much to do on the farm.  It's okay, I'll stay with him""

Caroline: ""Oh Lewis, you don't have to!""

Mayor Lewis:  ""No, no, it's my job to look after the town's citizens.  It's no trouble, really""

Caroline: ""Oh, thank you so much Lewis.  You really do take your job too seriously sometimes though.""

Abigail: ""Yeah, bye dad""

*The two walk out the door, Abigail looking at you before she leaves*

Harvey:  ""Well, it sounds like that's settled then.   Let me know if you need anything, or his condition worsens""

*Harvey heads upstairs to retire for the evening.  Don't ask why when it's only morning - these cutscenes have never made temporal sense.*

Lewis: ""Oh, _Farmer_!  Sorry I just remembered I could use a quick visit to the little boy's room.  Would you mind taking over just for a few minutes before I start my shift?""

*Lewis heads up to the bathroom*

*silence falls, and you walk up to Pierre*

Pierre: ""...""

*more silence*

Pierre:  ""It wasn't a dog.""

Pierre:  ""People would think I'm crazy, but...""

Pierre:  ""It wasn't a dog...""

*Pierre turns away from you in his bed*

*Lewis returns from the bathroom, smiling*

Lewis:  ""Thanks so much _Farmer_!  I'll take it from here!""

*Lewis takes your side beside Pierre*

Lewis: ""We're going to have so much fun tonight!  Did I ever tell you about the story of how I...""

*you back out the door, leaving the two*

(Choosing to stay silent is a similar scene)


With that excitement over with, you head out on the town to finish the odd chores.  Pierre's shop is closed, of course, but Joja Mart still has the oil you wanted for a couple recipes.  You head back home after a day's work, more concerned with your chores so you can build a greenhouse than this latest drama.  You go to sleep around midnight, and in the darkness you hear a distant moaning howl - the same as you thought you'd heard months ago in the forest on a rainy day by the Wizard's tower.  Weird.



**Day 0. 14th of Winter, Second Year.**


The next day, you complete your chores and head to town again, but something seems terribly wrong.  The streets are empty, and the door to the hospital is wide open.  You approach to investigate.  In an instant, the picture-perfect town you've grown up in for 2 years is shattered, as you gaze at the carnage inside.  Mayor Lewis's remains are scattered around the hospital bed, blood everywhere, as Harvey is bent over his torso - feasting. 

Harvey:  ""UNNNNNGHHHHH..""

 At your entry, he perks up, and shambles towards you.  You fumble with your tools, barely able to pull out your pickaxe in time to swing at him and knock him back a few feet - but the damage is minimal and you barely knock him back.  You back out the door, drawing your sword, and keep swinging - barely able to keep him at bay.  After your tenth swing you finally connect a critical hit, and Harvey's body slumps to the middle of the village square as his head rolls to a stop.  You vomit on the cobblestones, and black out.


*...*

Leah (or most compatible remaining partner):  ""Oh my god.  What have you...""

Distant Voice:  ""uuhhhhghhhhhhh.....""

Leah: ""What was that??""

Distant Voice:  ""UHhhhhhggghh""

Leah:  ""S... stay back!""

*you come to, but the world is grayer. It's getting dark.  Leah is standing over you, looking out into the darkness*

You get up, but shapes in the distance start to descend on you.  At least 4 figures are shambling towards you and Leah from the South and East.

Leah: ""Pierre..?""

""UHHHHHHGHHHHH""

Leah:  ""_Farmer_!  We have to get out of here!""

You run towards the farm, pulling Leah with you.  The creatures close in on you.  You run past the bus as more join from the road.  You just barely make it to your front porch as at least 8 of them swarm the two of you.  You slam the door just in time.  It creaks as they push against it.


Leah: ""_Farmer_, we need to barricade the door!""


You grab the nearby table and place it in front, backing away with your sword drawn.
Ghoulish hands appear at the windows.  You move furniture to block them too, and wait.  Leah stands close by your side.  The creatures' moans subside, but never stop.


Leah: ""What.... what were those things.""

Leah's terrified stare says it all.

You hold her, as the moans continue and the night closes in.

431,"Bernie supporter here, and I can't believe I watched that whole thing.   However - completely agree.  The media distorts his words, which - seen in the proper context - are generally fine contributions.  Major points:

- Illegal immigrants a problem because they bring in higher % of criminals? Fine, valid issue - let's discuss how to solve that.

- Could Mexico have more responsibility towards preventing this illegal immigration? Probably! Wall is hyperbolic, but yes - valid issue.  I question whether the price of an actual wall is worth it though.

- Temporary immigration ban on Muslims: not a policy I'd go with personally but clearly it's something worth discussing.  Does this mean people should hate on all Muslims? No. Problem is some people interpret it that way - be they overzealous supporters or the media pointing to them - and Trump might not have done enough to curtail that - which is concerning.  I think the policy itself does more harm than good though, as it polarizes everything, but it's not an unprecedented idea.  It does strike me as dangerously close to exploiting racism and fear mongering though, which the liberals (rightfully) oppose, even if the context was exploited by the media.

Overall: I see the exact same trend the Sanders campaign faced - the media is more than willing to misrepresent Trump and blow things out of proportion.  I don't blame people who don't see the full story, but I do blame a cruddy media institution that obfuscates the truth so easily.  It's shady, and it's almost certainly an establishment tactic.

I don't believe Sanders took many mischaracterized swings Trump's way, but I will be monitoring it from now on.  I'm concerned if he has a biased idea of Trump, as it's easy to do so unless you watch closely (same thing for Bernie - so watch closely).  However, I guarantee he would 100% support the idea of campaigning on the issues, straight-talked, with integrity, without turning everything into a sound-byte for the media circus.  I think a Trump / Sanders face-off might be the first honest debate between the Republican and Democratic ideologies in a long time, and I strongly believe Sanders would treat it respectfully and make it be about the facts, rather than two liberal/conservative circlejerks.  I really hope it happens because I'd love to see that.  If the two could come to a compromise (on anything, really) it would be fantastic to see too, and I bet the potential is there.

Bernie's the obvious choice to me in terms of policy/integrity - but I love what Trump's doing to the Republican party and hope we see him in the general.

(Edit: to be clear on my stance - Trump's hate on immigrants isn't good, and he's got a few other standard Republican stances that imo are pretty dumb.  But they're all that way, and his burn-it-all attitude just makes me smile, in all its gleeful crudeness.

In short, he's the reformer candidate of the Republicans.

451,"""I feel like we've been here before"", she said with a soft smirk.

Nero just glared, leaning heavily on his staff, a look of consternation on his face as the waves on the beach masked his panting. 

""And yet, I feel like we've only just begun"".

Nero swung his staff up - and a thousand tiny perturbations of the earth's mantle billions of years ago coalesced into a shift in the earth's crust.  Two plates collided with such persistent force over millions of years that the little island the wizards stood on was instead the central peak on a vast mountain range.  

Nero frantically surveyed his work, whipping his long white beard back and forth.  ""This outta be different enough...""

""Oh, hi there"" spoke the voice that put a chill down his spine.

She appeared over the mountain's edge, long hair flowing from the hood of a furred parka.  She looked different - her complexion darker, her height a little shorter - but the same bright blue eyes shone at him.

""Fancy meeting you, all the way up here"", she grinned, taking off her pack and sitting on a nearby stone.  She unscrewed her canteen and took a long drink.

Nero just gaped at her.

""How do you keep following me??"" he burst out, his sweaty white hair flailing around in rage. 

The girl smiled sweetly, lifting up the canteen and pouring out a steady stream onto the mountaintop.

""I'm afraid you must be mistaken - I've never met you before in my life""

The water trickled down the stone, slowly flowing past Nero to the edge of the mountaintop, where it began to spill over the steep side.

""Though I guess you might say - all rivers eventually meet the ocean""

Her blue eyes locked with Nero's.  He gripped his staff tighter, but he remained transfixed, even as his throat gulped in thirst and fear.

""You look like you've had quite a journey"" she said as she put the lid back on the canteen and held it out.  ""Any chance I can convince you to take a rest with me?""

Nero's eyes narrowed.

""I know who you are""

The girl inclined her head, leaning back on the rock.

""You're Death.  You've come for me""

The girl snorted, breaking into laughter.

""Is that what you think?  Mr I-can-change-whatever-I-want-forever?  You think I'm Death?""

Nero looked indignant, still glaring at the girl.

""No, I'm not Death.  But it is your Time.""

Her stare hardened. Nero raised his staff in fright. 

""The past is over"".

He brought his staff down, and countless generations of blue-eyed girls were removed from history as their parents were never born.

""The present is here"".

Said a blind nun behind him, the monestary window-light reflecting off a blue jewel around her necklace.

Crack. And the human race was obliterated in a meteor impact years ago, sparing only one man.

""And the future is ahead of us""

Said an illusion in the ocean mist, as Nero wept in the sands of the little island - his frail hands clutching a withered staff.

""There is so much for you to see""

I think he's just playing that to get the Republican base though and is much more centrist normally (face it, anti-immigrant/muslim hate/fear speech plays well).

457,"I like this plan so I'm gonna delurk and suggest some stuff:

1. If the goal is for this to plausibly be used by a futuristic society (or even modern non-mainstream tribal society, etc) then you want to make it rely minimally on language.  See https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/ as a great example: uses only 1000 (or ""ten hundred"" different words.  That plus tons of pictures and some sort of language/math intro and I figure it would be plausible to figure out even with 0 knowledge of the english language.   Though I think realistically you should focus on making it interesting to the modern viewer instead first anyway - because even if the farfetched hope that it seeds a post-apocalyptic civilization goal is your dream, making it a best-seller would do way more towards that regard than truly targetting it toward that (then again, the more mysterious it is the more likely everyone would want it on their coffee table.  Who says English is the best language anyway?)

2.  Not history-centric inventions, connection-centric inventions.  What you need to get up to our level as fast as possible - with emphasis on the starting stuff, and developing the badass late inventions that can enable skipping many levels.  For this, see James Burke's Connections series or Day the Universe Changed series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sb7bOljBAQ  for a well-researched (and entertaining) run-through of everything you're looking for. (Also, great way to get thinking about this casually while still formulating the whole thing).

3.  Crowdsource it as much as you can / are comfortable with.  Hell, make a subreddit even.  There's a lot of material - too much to study yourself - and getting it minimal and ordered right is so subjective that you might even appreciate the arguments from opinionated individuals with nothing else to do except argue about the civilizational value of chemical fertilizer.  That is, unless you want to keep the credit yourself and do it alone-ish - in which case, god speed bruddah.

4. Organize, plan, and write for free, maybe even illustrate for free if you're lucky, then Kickstart it or take it to a publisher for the rest.  Personally I think you've got an idea that could spawn a good Kickstarter provided you can prove you're far enough into it that it's gonna happen and the goals are realistic.

459,"&gt;  The impersonation attack is catastrophically bad. I would require authenticated messaging for such a system. Then scheduling can work as a layer on top of that, keeping everyone at a dull roar.

Would authenticated messaging prevent the impersonation attack entirely (at least a network-scale one)?  I figure someone could get backdoor access to people's private keys here and there, but they can't brute-force the identities from a whole network at least.

So ideal defensive network might be something like:  HMAC scheduled authenticated messaging, bans, and difficulty recreating a node.  Assuming this network *is itself* a consensus protocol, could that itself be used to authenticate a new node?  So maybe there's an ""unauthenticated node"" status that they graduate out of after completing the difficult computation problem and it propagating through the consensus protocol, and only then can they participate as a regular node again.  Still, I don't see anything preventing an attacker from just making thousands of these before his attack and happily sacrificing them.  Maybe nodes die-off if they're not used enough at least so the nodes-to-computation-power ratio is kept even - but that sounds like it would be inconvenient for regular users too (would it? meh).  Overall I'm unconvinced nodes can be treated as anything more than potential Sybil attacks waiting to happen.  But I guess I can see how with the proper structuring they might be able to contain some value as a limiting factor.

460,"Perfect. Thank you, this is exactly what I was hoping for.

My apologies for being ignorant of this (admittedly fairly basic and definitely look-up-able) stuff. I've basically just been guessing from first principles but your walkthrough confirms perfectly.

So, it's likely that an attacker can flood a node faster than its messages can be validated - but if the difference is some constant (1:2, 1:4, or even worse) it still means a limitation in the total number of nodes one attacker could shut down.  Or more generally, it limits the amount of processing power he can lock-down from nodes trying to participate, and costs him (probably less) processing power to do so.  So if the ratio is 1:4 then an attacker with 10% of the processing power can shut down around 40% of the good nodes, but can't deny the remaining 50%.  

This is more complicated when you consider nodes are discrete - and an attacker could potentially target one node with 10x the average node's computing power and get a larger payoff in his attack, but let's assume all nodes have relatively the same amount of processing power, or that nodes can be quickly destroyed and recreated, thus making it more dependent on processing power than which nodes are down.  

Besides, can't nodes just be re-created quickly anyway using virtual machines or something? If an attacker's node is banned, can't he just make a new node and move all this processing power to that pretty quickly anyway?  I imagine his network route could be changed easily enough to prevent identification, and there's no way his physical hardware could uniquely identify him, right?  Granted, there'd probably still be a time delay for this swap that's bigger than the scale we're using (ms) - but still.  So I guess the only way to make nodes mean something and thus bans mean something would be for the network to hinder the creation of a new node somehow and up that time limit to something unreasonable (if not limit it permanently).

And hmmm...  So, there might be some ways to structure the network to get the ratio in the defender's favor if HMAC and scheduled messaging was used, and bans meant something?  Or is this moot since the impersonation attack is way worse - forged messages able to ban the whole set of good nodes at low processing costs (just maxing the allowed messages)?

Regardless, I think my question on whether the ratio is linear or not is answered.  (Re-stating this because I did it wrong earlier by calling it ""constant"") If the defender's total processing power is D and the attacker's is A, the ratio is O(D/A), and not some crazy O(D/A^2) or some instant-win when the attacker just fills up some hardware limitation (filling up the pipe).  Meaning the attacker may have an advantage, but that advantage probably doesn't compound as he takes out nodes (it doesn't get subsequently easier, right?) and he can't just insta-win against a defender with far greater processing power.

As long as that's the case, then there's some worst-case linear ratio that can be approximated (which it might be able to be improved upon), but it can be used to approximate the safety of the network.  For instance, let's say our ratio is around 1:4 in favor of the attacker: then as above - an attacker with 10% can shut down 40% of the good nodes and vote with 10%/50%.  If it was a 1:1 ratio, in order to takeover the network, then, he'd need over 1/3 the total computing power: shut down &gt;1/3, vote with &gt;1/3 which is a majority - same result as classical Byzantine Agreement.  With 1:4 he'd need 1/6th, or the solution to 100%-x-4*x &lt;= x.  

Note though: it's slightly more complicated since ""voting"" isn't defined.  Since I'm assuming node creation is easy here, voting needs to cost processing power too, so it gets a little harder for the attacker:
- 1:4 ratio, he needs 100%-x-(4-1)x &lt;= x, so x &gt;= 1/5  (the good nodes minus the bad nodes, minus (4-1) DDoSed nodes must be less than the total bad nodes) 
- 1:1 ratio he needs 100%-x &lt;= x, so x &gt;= 1/2
(I'm also assuming a ""vote"" using processing power is possible, and that more than 50% means your side wins.  Bitcoin/Ethereum's ""vote"" is just a search for a new block - though it still fits here as it means someone who can DDoS some of the competition AND still beat the rest in a computation battle on average ""wins the vote"".  Matches the above formula so checks out)

General formula then, for completeness: ratio of one attack to one defense = D, % of total processing power bad = B, % of bad power used to DDoS = X, then 1-B-(X/D)B &lt;= (1-X)B, or **1/(2+X(1-D)/D) &lt;= B**

Sorry, I'm writing a thesis right now, I get carried away with these things.  But this is interesting.  Theoretical bounds on DDoS abilities (whatever they are) mean certain security guarantees - or failures.  What do you think the actual DDoS ratio is for the Ethereum or Bitcoin network?

If so then it's a constant:constant ratio (with respect to processing power).  What that ratio is exactly then depends a lot on the stuff I'm trying to wave away.  I guess in that case I'm just interested in what the worst-case attacker vs the best defending architecture would be, but that's probably more than we can answer.

And no, I'm assuming the defender can't tell the difference between an attacker and a valid message from a neutral party - though he might decide to throw out messages once the attacker sends too many.

476,"Well yeah but I mean - the only thing a republic adds is a constitution that is difficult to change.  It *can* be changed though - by any government - and with enough support they won't even get in trouble for it.  There's nothing inherently keeping those in power from picking on the minority except some laws we all think are cool, and the threat of pun.  A more direct democracy doesn't change that.  You can add a time/inconvenience delay to direct democracy too, or increase the required consensus to change a constitutional law to 90%, but in the end any group in power can change the laws - but presumably they won't, for the same reasons we don't change the constitution often now.  There's nothing special here about having representatives do it all - aside from you know who to blame afterwards.  (This liquid delegative democracy doesn't change that part either - as most decisions are made by people with many votes in their favor.

477,"Uh, in what definition of republic?
Dictionary.com:
&gt; 1. a state in which the supreme power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by representatives chosen directly or indirectly by them.
&gt; 2.any body of persons viewed as a commonwealth.
&gt; 3. a state in which the head of government is not a monarch or other hereditary head of state.
&gt; 4. (initial capital letter) any of the five periods of republican government in France.
&gt; Compare First Republic, Second Republic, Third Republic, Fourth Republic, Fifth Republic.
&gt; 5. (initial capital letter, italics) a philosophical dialogue (4th century b.c.) by Plato dealing with the composition and structure of the ideal state.

But let's just ignore semantics.  A pure democracy is just as capable of creating or destroying laws or constitutions which agree on fundamental rights that may not be violated by anyone.  Those don't just come from nowhere - some group must decide to idealize them into law and perpetually enforce them.  We could require 50% or 100% approval and we'd still be using some democratic mechanism.  Without it, with representative democracy, you're allowing a smaller group decide - presumably with the consent of their constituents, so &lt;1% decide instead.  If they fail to enforce the laws, then ultimately the major consequence is difficulty in re-election - so it's if &gt;50% of their constituents are made mad enough to do something about it (vs those who are actively willing to keep the politician).

482,"&gt; Now wait a minute -- you skimmed the paper, looked at section headings, and arrived at the conclusion it's not a scientific paper? You'd have to reads it more carefully to know if it's science, or not. I'm assuming you saw words like ""freedom"" and ""property"" and concluded it's philosophy because those are things that philosophy talks about.
Nope, those words are fine in scientific papers if used correctly - but they very rarely are, and so are usually good indicators of a hack piece.
Moreover, reading the entire thing is not a necessity of science.  Finding flaws in your argument or distrusting baseless claims is - and it doesn't take a meticulous eye to see those.  

Okay, I read your first two sections slightly more closely (I did in fact read the definitions as well as headings before - what I skipped was your unnecessary rhetorical preamble).  Here's the problem: I don't trust you.  And you give no reason for the reader to.  
You begin making unreferenced assumptions to the ""four types of property"" - why are those the four types? What about land to live on?  What about water? Where are you getting those from?  Don't tell me you just pulled those from ""science"".  You go on to define slavery in terms of these.
&gt; Logically, if all people controlled their own property, and never controlled the property of another, then all forms of stealing and slavery (1.12) would vanish.

Really? That's what you lead to? How about slavery (using your definition) brought on by everyone else owning all your potential property? No land or resources to ""apply labor"" to?

You go on to define property better, pulling Locke's definition.  Good, that's good - there's something concrete then.  Then you redefine it in terms of interactions between people - a product of the social contract.  From there you start defining everything in terms of this fundamental particle that is ""property"", saying property &amp; coercion make the basis of morality.  It gets more extremist from there.  You go on to say human rights are a dated concept and should be replaced by property rights as they're ""scientific"".  You go on to define terms of Right and Wrong as whether they stem from reason, and whether they interfere with a person's property.

Your entire argument rests on your definition of property being a fundamental concept and somehow scientifically and morally sound, so let's address that.  First off, this is what makes it a philosophical paper rather than a scientific one - because you're not making claims to truth, you're making claims to ""Truth"" in the absolute ""Moral"" sense.  To someone who believes property should define morality and is the fundamental right of humanity - sure, they're bound to like the rest of what you've written.  But let's take a step back - because you did nothing to argue the *why* of how you chose that.  Did you consider criticisms of Locke's definition of property?  They're not hard to find - Rousseau, Hobbes and Marx had plenty in that era.   But I don't intend to go hunting them down and having a philosophy war with you - too much work.  The point is, you're making a moral claim without proving it convincingly, and pretending it's all ""science"" from there, while shoveling as many simplified examples of why your ideas are right on top as possible.  You're being disingenuous by calling that all ""science"".  The whole thing has a strong tone of arrogance - and it's because you *are* being arrogant.  You refuse to cite other sources of these ideas, you claim they're your own, you claim the titles of ""scientific"" and ""logical"", you talk down to the reader using trivial examples of why the current state of affairs is stupid and thus your solution will fix everything.  I think you fail to grasp that just because you *have* logic in your paper doesn't mean people can only disagree with said logic.  There are plenty of philosophical claims you make which deserve way more discussion and discretion than you give them, and the language/tone you use throughout the paper is - as /u/inviolinable put it - in need of editing, as it comes off as extremely condescending and ""culty"".

I see what you're trying to do.  You want to set up some definitions or property, morality etc and show that everything flows logically from there to a decentralized OSG system. If so - then you need to be clearer and more humble about that.  Say straight-up that you're not intending to make claims to morality (or else be prepared to defend them and pay proper homage to the philosophical discussion that has gone on looooong before you stepped in), and just say ""if we accept this, this is what happens"".  I don't doubt your arguments from there can be made logically sound and interesting - but it's all hidden by this grandiose claim that you've solved the world's problems and it all inevitably makes sense - because science.",2015-11-24 20:55:28+00:00,cxbteys,3.0,t1_cxb5zob,49667.0,ethereum

484,"I skimmed this paper - and by skimmed I mean scrolling through it all and reading just the titles and small excerpts to see where you were going with it - it took almost an hour.
This was not a scientific paper nor a white paper - but you know that.  Someone might define it as a philosophy paper - in that it tries to explain a moral stance, using examples from the world and logical arguments.  I would recommend you call it that.  I would also recommend you investigate and define the moral stance you're arguing for and present that at the top/summary of the paper before leading people down a very long rabbit hole just to discern it on page 200.  (Something like ""Libertarian free market idealism enforced by decentralized contracts"").  Otherwise you are just reinventing the wheel by trying to build a moral philosophy from the ground up.  
I'm not an expert on that stuff - I just know it when I see it - but I expect posting this to someone who has read a number of these (perhaps on /r/philosophy) could give you some challenging critiques that your stance faces - assuming you indeed care to investigate the real truth and this isn't just designed to convert people to your cause.

Personally, I find fault with your conclusion that the best form of democracy is ""economic democracy"" - aka ""voting with your wallet"" will solve all - especially when it appears to be based on rhetorical claims / self-evidence (""direct democracy is cumbersome"" and ""representation democracy no longer functions in the US"" therefore economic democracy) rather than a logical, well-explained argument.  I also questioned your bias when seeing global warming compared to tribal scare mongering about the storm gods - though perhaps you have a less-politically-biased reason for that which I didn't see in the paper.

TL;DR:  In its current form, this is free-market-based ethereum utopia rhetoric (poorly) disguised as a scientific paper.  Clearly you care about the subject and your respectability as a writer enough to have spent this long on it.  As such, I recommend you look at what other writers have done when presenting a moral philosophy and its practical applications, reference the work/criticisms others have done on the subject, and tighten your arguments to prevent unfiltered bias from seeping through.  You are not the first to write a manifesto on this stuff and try to justify it with ""science"".  But before the actual internal logic can be addressed you need to be honest with the reader.  This should not hold the scientific/white paper label - but with some improvements / references to the literature this could maybe be a philosophy paper.

488,"Hmmm... interesting...

1) Yeah I guess I see the writing on the wall as far as desktop/phone security goes.  And two-factor isn't much of an improvement since it just relies on the two not being simultaneously hacked right?  I guess I'm just amazed that there's no other clever solution to keep things secure using the existing technology.  But you're right, a wallet's not that bad - though it might take a while to get adopted.  I wonder if we might see hardware wallets built into smart phones one day - with the memory/software stored separately in the hardware so hacking the phone OS could never gain access to it, but you can boot up the wallet using some of the same hardware if necessary / use it with a physical button.  If this made it into the new android and iphone within a couple years we could count on everyone having one pretty soon.  ('Course, keeping everything on your phone might be a bit risky too - but they're just such good multi-tools that I can't imagine it not going this way unless there are physical constraints.  Plus, it could just beep at you when you have more than $1000 on your phone wallet, telling you to upload to your main storage/safe/bank/whatever - risk averted)

2) Ah, I see what you mean.  Yeah, needs the centralized system at a minimum anyway. Hmmm...  So batching could help if you care about securing lower-value items, but it's not strictly necessary.  Maybe could be a user-configurable thing then, where they can set the minimum item value to secure on ethereum and the transaction fees come from their account (not Valve's), with default values at some sane level (e.g. transaction fees &lt; 10% of item value).  Interesting stuff though - it comes so close to being too much trouble for Valve or users to care about, yet it's a good answer to the problem. Hmm.

489,"I'd just like to say: this is an excellently-conducted and well-written study into what-I-now-think is a fascinating problem.  This should be a relatively simple use case of ethereum, yet your proof of concept betrays some interesting complexities that arise from ethereum itself.    While you seem to have proven there's a place for this system for high-value items - the downsides of transaction speed (especially for crates), physical wallet, price-per-interaction and simultaneous centralized and decentralized systems are sizeable.  The fact a simple use case like this still runs into such tradeoffs even in a theoretical proof of concept makes me question the practicality of ethereum itself.  Very interesting.  Thanks for posting this - and writing it in such laymans terms.

Now I'm wondering two things: 

1) Are we really doomed to hardware wallets, or is there any hope for secure desktop/cell phone wallets?  I guess this has been answered by others, but your use case really made me notice how big a barrier this might be to mainstream adoption.  I mean, Steam could just send people a hardware wallet when they score big-ticket items, or we could hope on a future where everyone is responsible and has a secure ethereum account they use for all sorts of different apps, but it seems like this would never be done if just left to the discretion of Steam users.  (barring a few die-hards, but not worth developing a whole system for)

2) Could we not combine transactions for smaller items / statistic interactions into local packets/blocks, only paying to upload them to the ethereum contract (and thus pay the transaction fee) when their value or quantity has exceeded some customizable threshold?  That way, Steam could still offload everything to this one system, with the only minimal risk to users being losing this buffer of low-level items/data in event of a hack/crash.  That seems fairly acceptable (if possible) and at least removes the ugliness of having Steam maintain two systems - one decentralized one centralized - just to secure a 15% profit on this black market.

Wow. Burning flames 15k. Unbelievable.  Yikes though - if Steam could get 15% of every sale for things like that still - that's some nontrivial cash.  Would it be illegal even though? Why the $400 limit in the first place?

490,"Let's be clear: there are some good things in the TPP, and something like it is probably inevitable if not necessary.  However, there's plenty of shit amongst it designed to give the industries and politicians who crafted it more power and control - and bring all countries in it closer to the deregulated market ideals of the US at the cost of sovereignty.  

Due to the nature of the agreement (Accept it or be left out. No changes) and the incentives of individual politicians (lobbied by the corporate powers who wrote the TPP) there's a huge incentive to overlook those flaws.   If they can even present the TPP to the public as a ""reasonable agreement with some flaws"" without sparking a major public protest then that's more than enough to pass it - since ""there's no point in throwing the baby out with the bathwater"", and ""every country has to have *some* disagreement with it! That's how trade agreements always go!"".  It's a divide and conquer technique that plays right into the hands of the corporate powers who wrote it (because the division is over countries, and they span them).

493,"Thank you so much, this is exactly what I've been hoping for.  I'm still looking over the different options and trying to get a handle on exactly what's being done there (not much of a statistics background I'm afraid) but so far I'm leaning towards the Hodges-Lehmann and/or Huber estimators - though even just knowing the theoretical underpinnings of t-truncating or taking the median is very helpful already.

My apologies, there is no contradiction but I did not formulate the problem very clearly.  There are n nodes, n-t of which are good and t bad.  The adversary must pick at least n-2t good nodes and at most t bad to be in the final sample - which is all we can see (and n, t, and the min/max possible value range are known).  So those n-2t good nodes are not (necessarily) iid from the n-t original good nodes.  This may add an extra layer to the problem, since even if these M-estimators can minimize error from the t bad nodes in this (n-2t + t = n-t) sample then there's still the original error from the adversary (in worst case) truncating the highest or lowest t nodes from the original n-t good nodes distribution that we're trying to determine.  I have some ideas to reduce that total error (e.g. detecting if the mean would have shifted the estimator right, and if so - compensate by shifting left - so the adversary can never shift right in both the original pick of n-2t good nodes and by setting his t bad node values), but none with strong theoretical underpinnings.

Just to clarify, this original n-t values doesn't necessarily conform to any known distribution (uniform, normal, etc) and it's just data - specifically opinion/sensor data from n-t people/nodes.

After a moderate look into it, my answer is: yes!  HOWEVER - has democracy always been that way? Not quite!

You can see it when you study how things got corrupted in the first place* and the treatment of radical leaders**.  So really, even if the state of things might suck now - even when we make the best of our 2-3 choices - democracy is probably still our best weapon against this shit.

Also, I have hopes for a gradual adoption of more online voting / direct democracy sort of stuff - but interestingly enough that's just on the cutting edge of being securely possible (not hackable) so give it a few more years to get it right.

- I read somewhere that the first online currencies were open to the rule of law and had a centralized system, but the legal requests and attempts at government control brought them down.  Might have just been post-justification for other failures, but I could see how government/legal interference could be a problem, especially in countries more easily corruptible - which might be the best markets for early blockchain services.  Doesn't this add centralization and therefore a weak point?

1) Could you link or explain to me how to deal with 33% safety violations - what's this ""known verifiers"" solution?  ""bonding rules""? (Similar to Stellar's locally-trusted quorum slices?  If so - is Stellar good enough overall, would you say?)

2) What's your take on the current state of BFT assumptions being used - i.e. static adversary (vs active), full-information adversary, requiring cryptographic private channels, (a)synchronicity (or weak asynch, like assuming message delays won't grow faster than time), safety guarantees but usually not liveness, (non-)determinism

I'm researching this stuff myself, trying to pin down both: what assumptions are being used in each protocol (Stellar, Tendermint, etc) and which ones are needed ideally.  I realize some solutions are simply missing - e.g. strong, active, full-information adversary with no cryptographic assumptions in an asynchronous system has no known solution guaranteeing resilience against 1/3 attackers (deterministic or otherwise).  Do you think the research is sufficient yet for permanent BFT blockchains?  Is someone doing it right yet?

(At the moment I'm thinking: active adversary with full-information and no cryptographic assumptions asynchronously would be nice but might be stronger than we need.  I'm still figuring out if Stellar's model is safe enough - are Quorum slices resilient to 1/3? - but I like the federated local trust thing - seems to solve this ""trustless"" stuff you're talking about.)

Hard part seems to be making a registration service that can securely issue that token in the first place, and keep it 1-per-person.  Centralized government service presumably could do it (and does it now) in-person, but that kinda ruins the spirit of cryptocurrencies. 

As for vote selling - one approach is to allow a person to vote any number of times and only the last vote is counted, discouraging instantaneous vote-buying.  Doesn't do much for vote-first-then-payment though - since they can still confirm it.
Ooh - maybe combine these two ideas.  ID service can issue you multiple IDs, but communicates with the voting protocol so only the last vote used with one of those IDs counts.  Then you could trick any would-be vote buyer by creating two secret IDs, charging for your vote with one, and silently voting differently with the other.  Trick is then outsiders couldn't be allowed to verify two IDs belong to the same person -&gt; therefore verification is broken.

507,"I'm not so convinced society would just crumble if everyone was just watching tv, reading, playing games, eating and sleeping - so long as production for all those things (especially food and internet) was being fulfilled (automateable task).  I'm also not entirely convinced that lifestyle would be covered entirely on a basic income, but let's say it is.  Are you really going to do that for 12 months a year, perpetually? I highly doubt it.  I predict those binges are a psychological response from working a stressful job so long where you felt powerless.  Speaking as a freelance programmer, there's a point where the slacking off enjoyment lessens (and believe me, I've matched your binges and then some) and you feel like you want to accomplish something again.  When that happens - and especially when you're actually interested in a project - the process reverses and suddenly you kinda actually *want* to work (and then feel really weird about it!). 

But even if everyone *was* just consuming media forever (books, video games, tv shows) - is there no value in that?  You're learning, you're probably thinking about the materials (whether you think you are or not), you're probably talking about them with others and contributing to their understanding and enjoyment of the topic.  Isn't school a lot like this - except more regimented towards what you *should* watch?  Is it not conceivable that a lifestyle like this might lead you to be inspired into making some of this media yourself, or developing an expertise in some area?  Is that not valuable?

There will always be some tasks that need doing that people don't like - but the monetary compensation for that will still be there.  They'll get done.  The question is whether we want our society to be filled with people spending the non-essential time free to learn, heal, and develop themselves, or to provide cheaper labor for jobs not deemed worth doing (or else they'd freely do them).

508,"Because a Basic Income provides enough money for the bare minimum - not for a ""good"" lifestyle by anyone's standards other than hobos and college students.  If everyone would live that frugally, then yeah - maybe there'd be a problem making the numbers work (though I'd argue that it'd be way better for society from an environmental standpoint), but that's just not at all the case now.  Even the average middle class family will need to supplement their BI with an income to stay comfortably above the poverty line - the difference is, they won't have to do as much, and will have more freedom in job selection.  You'll still have to sacrifice if you don't want to work or need to re-tool your education to try something different, but the safety net is there now - or at least, isn't lined with barbs to keep you in it anymore.

Right now our entire education system and social consciousness is oriented towards the idea that people should work for a reason greater than mere survival.  We already have a (crappy) welfare safety net and a general public opinion that people are lazy drains on society if they don't work.  In other words - there are still plenty of motivational forces to work besides fear of survival.  People are going to want to feel valued, to build a life that's above the baseline, and work on things they enjoy - same as they do now.  If jobs can't provide one of those reasons, or a large enough monetary incentive, then they'll lose employees - same as they ever have. 

The people who feel like they hate work and just want to do ""nothing"" for the rest of their lives may seem like a lot of us now - but as the boot gets off your face you and you've had some time out to look at your life there may be some things you realize you actually do want to contribute to.  Some of those things might not be compensated for with money as well as you'd like, but that's okay - part of the value of BI is that people don't have to follow this imperfect financial valuation of things that contribute to society.  Just living lightly, being a help to your friends, studying and contributing to an area of interest, and doing some part-time labor for extra money on the side might be way better for everyone than having you work 9-5, neglecting your friends and interests and overconsuming to compensate for the enormous daily stress. 

Regardless, this is a question that needs to be tested through trials before being implemented on a large scale.  This is just the BI-proponent prediction though - and there's little reason to believe the cynical ""nobody will work and the world will burn"" hypothesis is any better.

If anything, you could say the nazi and french revolutions were caused by these mini-revolutions NOT happening, until it got so desperate that the entire population was ready to roll heads (literally) and overturn their entire societies.  ""Good, [slow], healthy change"" is an invitation for the ""level-headed"" rulers to maintain their power - and when they don't have the public's best interest in mind there are plenty of opportunities to load the game in their favor - so I still prefer a politically-active, angry populous to a passive, patient, ""level-headed"" one.  Revolutions, strikes, other forms of protest - they are the public's last (and possibly only) tool against being trapped by rules they can't control.  As soon as that's lost (and it can only really be lost by public sentiment against it) then there's nothing that can be done in an unfair system.

Obviously, if there was a clear fair mechanism for change (that actually worked) and people had a choice of using it rather than getting riled up and angry at relatively-inconsequential things, then that'd be better (your ""level-headed"" approach).

510,"Hey, let's be fair - Donald Trump is a Holy Angel sent from heaven to Usher America into a New Age.  He's the best candidate the Republicans have produced in a century, and his shining hair piece will lead us all to Salvation.

But yep, a singular vote is quite manipulable - just as a singular person is.  An institution of voting might do better though - more as a thing for people to gradually pay attention to and develop opinions on than a trust in the voting process itself.  You may be able to manipulate a few people, or even the entire public perception for a span of a few months, but gradually the balance shifts back - at a speed that is sometimes generational - but it's there.  (Of course, we only figure out the old manipulation by that time, but haven't developed immunity to the new ones - e.g. Obama The Hope of Mankind).

Though this is glossing over the fact that our voting algorithm itself is horrible.  In the US and Canada, First Past the Post is used to game the system into only accepting 2-3 viable candidates - who are then each co-opted by corporate interests - and the public has no choice but to pick the one closest to them or risk wasting their vote. (Here in Canada we think we're better for having 3 choices, but it has just enabled our Conservative party to get a majority government despite having only 40% of the popular vote and *everybody* on the other sides hating them. Ridiculous).

Donald Trump's success may actually be a byproduct of this system - since any candidate with recognition amongst a sea of relatively unknowns is way more likely to get votes when people are told to ""choose exactly one"".  If people were voting with their actual preferences (e.g. saying who they'd approve of, or rating each candidate 1-10) then Trump's polls are much more believable. Ref: http://rangevoting.org/Trump2015.html

As a sidenote: Voting system algorithms are my thesis topic for a masters degree I'm working on right now, so I've done my fair share of reasoning why FPTP is a poor choice for a true democracy.  If you're curious - I think Approval Voting is the most realistic best choice (since it's so simple to implement) and Range Voting is the ideal (as it's much more expressive).  However, it's pretty likely that voting system reform is going to be fought tooth-and-nail by any and all parties in power.

511,"For a lot of things, this ""free-market"" approach is our solution - and it works!  For any commodity people want, it's the perfect solution.  For smaller organizations (you don't like this team, make your own) it's a reasonable approach.  But as soon as required level of organization becomes too big, it becomes a problem.  Creating a competing football league using the ""new rules"" means building a massive, massive organization from the ground-up - while being held-down in every way possible by the existing league.  The power imbalance is so one-sided these competitors would never have a chance - their players would be stolen for much higher salaries, and they'd have to fight tooth and nail just to get stadium time (though they're mostly owned by the state, the traditional league would have deep pockets and high-level contacts).  Put into a political perspective, this mechanism of change would require a massive imbalance of popular support in favor of the new rules for people to weather this battle and still support it. Sure, you might think the new rules are better, but do you really want to spend years attending games only on off-hours, with the players rejected by the major league, while the old league badmouths you through advertisements the whole time?  Moreover, from a group perspective this is hugely wasteful - even if this new league succeeded, by that time you've basically had to rebuild the entire structure to replace the old one, costing millions of dollars in administration, advertising, creating a sports news network, etc. (This is assuming you dont have to build your own stadiums - yeesh).

In short - I don't think the ""free market"" approach can work for such large undertakings. There are some things we are forced to cooperate on as a society, because making a copy is just too expensive.  Imagine this football example with 6-7 competing camps and you've got a problem.  Still, for things like this the solution is typically to make all the big expensive stuff into easily-interchangeable infrastructure and make a mechanism of easy-replacement (e.g. the government, which can be replaced every 4 years). For instance, stadiums would have to become much more open to competing leagues.  This doesn't solve the money/power imbalance problem - which still warrants a huge swing of common support to make up for it - but it greases the wheels at least.  We'd also have to make some protection against the negative tactics used by entrenched powers so these new groups couldn't be easily silenced with attack ads.

Also, see my Facebook example above in my reply to /u/macallen - there are some things that just need a massive change all at once to work.  For this, free market just ain't gonna cut it - it takes intense organization to do.  From a game-theory perspective, this is the tragedy of the commons.  If we could marry free market and political organization into one simple process and make it easily apply to different things - e.g. football - then we might be getting somewhere.  That's like the libertarian wet dream.

But until then, I guess all I'm saying is I understand the FJW approach - and it might be the only real viable option there is for opposing unyielding structures.  Though yes, it has some negative side-effects, and it'd be nice if there's a better way to make change.

(As for the nazis, there are a ton of different factors there. I might agree there's a little bit of GJW fault there - people being outraged - but they had some good reasons (crumbing economy and worldview).

512,"Couldn't agree with you more! (and awe- thanks!)  Injecting politics into everything creates a fairly toxic environment - even if it's [currently somewhat] necessary for change.  And I'd see anyone who has just fallen to this level as their first-resort as deeply wounded and not entirely healthy.  e.g. if one of those football critics leapt to immediately notifying the media and gathering troops to change the local highschool's rules over some incident - without even approaching the principal &amp; coach in question first and asking kindly/respectfully and rationally presenting the argument.  However, as an outsider, it's also very hard to gauge whether that's the case - these people might have tried to do it kindly, but fall-back to this more forceful way when met with unyielding resistance.  I don't have to like it, but it's hard to judge them for it.  Similarly, judging the topic - say, football - as a trivial thing to try and change isn't really fair either, as it just tacitly supports the old way - and these things can be really important to some people.  So I have a lot of sympathy for the FJW-like people, though I too wish there was a better way.

As a sidenote to that - my argument seems to be leading to the idea that if we had a way to vote [online] on these things and discuss the issue through a formal process, and everyone actually used it, then this need for FJW justice would drop - as suddenly these guerrilla tactics become more of a hindrance since they turn-off a lot of people to the cause. These groups might then turn to just positive reinforcement - trying to recruit people one-on-one the same way you try and recruit people to a political candidate.  Oh God, I just reasoned the political process is a good thing, didn't I?  The key phrase here is ""everyone actually used it"" though - that ain't easy.

Also similar note: the problem of changing institutions like football etc is pretty-much the same problem as trying to leave Facebook: you might hate it, many of your friends might hate it, but unless everyone leaves it en-masse you're stuck with it because that's just the way it is - even if there are plenty of better social networking alternatives.

514,"I'm not really talking about football here, but let's continue the metaphor.  Let's say someone comes along with a valid criticism of football from a historical perspective, or the perspective of football vs other popular sports and concludes there are improvements which could be made - saying the problems are not anyone's fault in particular but that the industry as a whole has some (solveable) issues.  This person makes some videos of these criticisms, making it clear that she's just commenting from an academic perspective and opinion, and posts them on a personal site.  In an effort to get those ideas noticed by the higher-ups, she then creates a petition to the same effect and post it on her site.

It turns out a lot of people share these opinions. Links to her videos and petition are spread throughout the internet, with people for and against them battling in forms ranging from respectful discussions to flame wars to simplistic memes on Tumblr.  People start taking notice, these criticisms are seen as a political movement to disrupt or even destroy football.  Everyone's riled up on both sides.  

Demographically, it turns out many of the people supporting this critical side don't even watch football regularly (though they express that they'd like to, and say it's the violence/offensiveness that stops them).  The other side are mostly all regular viewers, and their argument follows the same lines as yours - ""no one is forcing you to watch. No one is forcing them to play.  It's a free country. If you don't like it, stop watching"".

Now, who is being arrogant here?  The criticism was just someone speaking their mind relatively-privately on the industry as a whole, and people agreed on it - how can she be at fault?  And clearly there are some arrogant people on both sides (in the flame wars) but overall the critical side is hardly arrogant just for existing.

Now let's say that the football establishment refuses to comply to any of these criticisms. What do these critics do?  Believe it or not, it is not always a free country.  They can't just make their own football league, when players, stadiums, and international competition contracts are all effectively-monopolized by these established interests.  Creating an alternative is next to impossible.  Sure, these criticisms don't need to be followed entirely - they aren't like, threats from some terrorists - but the refusal to listen to them and the resulting fight of us-vs-them poisons the waters and makes all discussions (even from the most even-handed) seem like attacks to those who feel fine about football as-it-is.  Football fails to change, the moderate critics detach from the discussion (and stop watching football), feeling dejected, and an internet culture of putting-down any remaining people who express such cricisms becomes acceptable, pointing to the remaining more-extreme activists as examples of the side's stupidity.  FJWs, they call them.

Now - who's in the wrong here?

Let's take it further: these FJWs, realizing the soft movement to get things changed failed despite considerable support, examines their options. Since there is no formal mechanism for them to change things (there is no vote) - they take a more-general political approach.  They go around making petitions, bothering people of importance to try and see their side, and actively pursue smaller systems that they can change.  They petition school football games to adopt a set of new, ""safer"" rules. They bring attention to the worst cases of ""injustice"" where the old rules have resulted in serious injuries and harm by means of social media - often to the detriment of coaches/principals/schools who are just ""following the old rules"" but end up taking the blame.  The waters continue to get muddier for these critics - while they gain followers outraged by these extreme examples, others are turned-off by the militant approach that's being taken and turn away.  Meanwhile, the football establishment continues to ignore these criticisms and fervently sticks to the ""old rules"".  Casual football watchers are now all aware of the criticisms, and though some agree logically they now refuse to join the ""other side"" since they see it as extreme.  The groups polarize further and shift as people come and go.

It's easy to blame the FJWs here, as they are causing such a fuss in the system to relatively-innocent people/institutions - only guilty of following ""the way things are"". However, without a formal mechanism to express their complaints, and an industry-at-large that refuses to enact change from the top-down, isn't this bottom-up approach their only choice?  What would you do instead?  If they are guilty - is everyone who wants this football-change guilty, or just those who resort to pushy tactics?  Should they feel ashamed for wanting things ""their way"" when the ""normal way"" might not necessarily have a majority support if/when everyone is aware of the whole situation/argument, the replacement system's been studied/tested by the industry, the ""us-vs-them"" tribalism has settled down, and there's a fair formal way to vote on such changes?  Isn't this just the unfortunate side-effect of politics?  Is this so bad because we believe things like football (which are close to the heart of a lot of people) should never change and never be questioned, or because we just dislike the way this change happens? Is this not an incentive for those at the top to provide ways for these criticisms to be discussed, measured, and enacted without igniting such a war from both sides? (Isn't that why we invented democracy?)

518,"""Hipster"" is a loose-fitting term identifying individualistic behaviors/interests that stray from other labels.  I say individualistic because when the style is replicated by a group intentionally it becomes a new label: ""yuppie"", ""punk"", ""clubber"", etc.  This is probably happening to ""hipster"" right now too as its style (noticeable for its out-of-the-norm look) has since been replicated by major fashion companies (or was originally by them all along - who knows) and is thus becoming the new normal.

The word's usage, however, is typically to shame people who partially identify in opposition to another culture (i.e. ""normal society""), and who typically fall into the 20-30, college/university, liberal, intellectual crowd.  They are also likely to share certain political/economic beliefs in support for local businesses, hand-crafted goods, organic produce, and overall: quality over marketability.  They also typically share some level of anti-corporate/anti-capitalist sentiment, thus their possessions are often ""ironic"" - intentionally or otherwise (e.g. a hipster might use an old typewriter instead of a computer as a statement, use hand-knit wool handwarmers, etc).  If one was to view words as having a purpose in our society, the label ""hipster""s purpose (and its negative connotation) might be to discourage deviation from easily-marketable consumer profiles amongst young people.  It has since been attached to all cases of perceived anti-social individualism which is seen as elitist or distancing from the perceiver (e.g. two people sit down on a bench - the third person sits on the armrest and rests a foot on the remaining spot ""just to be different"" - hipster).  This degenerates further to just - anyone different from you.

One sentence answer:  A hipster is someone who pushes individualism outside the bounds of typical (and easily marketable) group labels - ironically becoming a new label.

519,"So I got around to reading [vitalik's multichain post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/13/scalability-part-3-metacoin-history-multichain/) after posting this - seems there could-well be a future of multiple blockchains loosely corresponding to provide joint security.  Consensus protocols might be different still, and in-turn the cost associated with them, so the question stands whether specific-use-case-oriented protocols could be better in certain cases.  Are you saying the cost of interoperability (these third-party servers) would add too much trouble for these specialized coins to be worth it, and thus the generalizable ETH is strictly better?

521,"This. So much this.  Ever since Bill Clinton's re-election campaign the game has changed to a series of micro-optimizations to appeal to certain demographics of voters - aka the ""I'd like to have a beer with that guy"" appeal.  Hillary may not have the ""outsider appeal"" Bernie has, nor the well-thought-out mandate, but that can only go so far.  Hillary has a massive team helping her optimize every other detail, and will have learned from Obama to appear as a Savior of Change.  She may even try stealing some of Bernie's mandate and try to appeal as a bring-down-corporations candidate if it's successful enough, so we can't rely on that either.  (Though if she did, we should consider that a very nice consolation prize - I'm betting it was Bernie's most realistic goal here.  Even if it ends up as mere lip-service...)

In short, Bernie needs to play some of the Washington game.  He's not going to be able to teach everyone, and not everyone is going to get him.  Clearly there's a big ""market"" for his anti-corporate stance (to put it in their terms), and nobody else can match his authenticity, but a good product isn't always enough - not when there's someone else who can outperform in every other market and even make a pretty-good imitation in his.

http://rangevoting.org/Trump2015.html


Trump's success is a by-product of a dumb voting system that disproportionately rewards fame.  If people could choose more than one candidate or rank candidates this wouldn't be an issue, but First Past the Post makes it easy for well-known-but-barely-liked candidates to get initial votes and then keep the momentum as everyone is forced to strategically accommodate them.  If anything, this should be a huge red flag to the Republican party to change their primaries voting mechanism to Approval voting.

A solitary tune by a fisherman, though, can be an invaluable treasure.

Elegant beyond words, he chants his songs night after night.
