I'd argue that the system as it stands is not - mainly due to the influence of money on politics, enabling lobbyists to own candidates, pass laws giving their companies monopolies or advantages, hedge risk on government bailouts while reaping the rewards, control media and advertising, and prevent competition  (in other words - wealth begets wealth).  Not all rich people are guilty, obviously, and it's the statist system as a whole that's the problem, but to what extent can we blame the class of people that continue to use this infrastructure for profit and control at the expense of the voting public's ability to affect the system?

I ask here because - other than the few statist Dems and Republicans who don't seem to care so much about this as that the other side's racist or racist-blaming - this anti-establishment, anti-wall-street sentiment seems to be a uniting issue among many political groups, seemingly with the exception of you guys.  And I'm trying to figure out why exactly.

I understand lack of faith in groups pushing an anti-wall-street agenda because their policies don't necessarily make sense either (e.g. Bernie's comped tuitions, when the market is flooded with degrees from overcharging universities as it is), but I can't help but think you guys are equally anti-establishment, anti-corporate-control-of-government and anti-wall-street (as it currently stands) too.  My guess is you don't support things like ""tax the rich!"", or ""regulate Wall Street!"" because on principle they violate individual rights to property and a free market, but I don't see how you can justify that the financial elite are not [a large part of] the problem with the system as it stands - and therefore those are fair reactions to the current state of affairs (though maybe not good prejudices to keep after it's reformed).

I'm concerned people in this subreddit are recommending it over better alternatives like Approval or Score Voting.

Ranked Choice voting doesn't actually escape the 2-party strategic trap that FPTP has had.  It *seems like it should*, but it doesn't.  Approval voting is another simple system that avoids these flaws and gets us a third-party-viable system.  Ranged Voting would be even better (0-5 stars per candidate), and proportional representation would be nice for any senate/congress elections, but yeah - Approval is a big improvement that's easier for the public to understand than ranked and is actually mathematically superior.  Go for Approval instead!

They placate our leader, edit our booing, and disrupt our means of communication (come on, if that wasn't intentional timing I don't know what is, right when they needed the sanders crowd to shut up and tow the line.  They got to the s4p mods. easy enough).  They expect we'll dissipate long enough to not affect the primary, and most of us will join in with Clinton.  Hell, it's not even the worst deal anymore - they won over Bernie, and he says they'll even try to get Glass Steagall repealed and break up the banks.

But this is the way they do it.  This is how the revolution is broken and bent to their purposes.  They funnel you into a choice between a corrupt system and mindless anarchy - neither embodying the hope or change that fueled you.  They remove your options, corrupt whats left so you distrust your peers (shills!), and scramble your channels of communication until you feel alone and burnt out on politics - unwilling to care so deeply again, only able to tow the party line or quit entirely.  Those who still retain their anger are swept up by the bulldozer that is the Trump campaign - their feelings used to power a machine beyond their control, which will never hold the intelligent policies or hope for real change Bernie did.

This is the way it's always been.  There is a pattern.  They know how to manage it.  We are not unique.  We're merely an anomaly in just how powerful we've been, how well we've done, how big we've gotten.  We scared them.  But we're being managed now.  We lost.  And now the pattern is we dissipate, to wait for another big leader in some big event to spur us.  They know this.  We know this.

We may continue, winning congressional elections, building power in the Democratic Party, shifting things left little by little.  It's still in our best interests to do so.  The Democrats may even begin to mimic our values, if we become a valueable enough resource.  But we arent an imminent threat anymore.  We are a Climate Change, we are a rising tide.  They will escape, Hillary will use us to win or blame us for the loss.  We are the landscape now - an environmental hazard at best.  Our imminent power is gone.

He who wielded it is one of them.  He knows the corruption - he always has.  He makes the best choice he can with what power we can give him - he always has.  If we think he continues to believe in what he always has, then we should give him more power.  If he continues to believe the alternative of Trump is a false one, we should believe him.  If he decided to endorse Hillary, we should mourn him but understand his compromise.

This is how the world is.  We don't have to like it.  We don't have to believe in it.  We can do every little tiny bit we can to boo, convince, uncover corruption, pressure liars, support heroes, understand Trump supporters, decry Trump policies, decry Hillary supporters, understand Hillary compromisers, fund revolutionaries, spotlight corruption, teach alternative voting systems, yell, scream and rage at the unfathomable evil of the system and every person that has been corrupted and compromised within it.

But this is the system.  This is what it is and always has been.  If you try to sit it out, you enable it.  If you try to fight it, you win small or you lose.  If you play within it, you compromise and are compromised.  If you try to replace it, you become the enemy.

Bernie became part of the system today - for better and for worse.  We will scatter, supporting him or abandoning him in various ways.  We may yet still provide a new landscape of power that enables the next election, or the next generation, a higher climb.  But we lost.  Some of us will be broken by this realization.  This enables the system.  Some of us will continue to rage - the system will survive it, or Trump will use it for fuel.  Some of us will continue to try and change the system - we will meet more loses and more small wins and the game will continue.

This is how it is.  But never forget it.  We saw how it really is this year.  We saw it proven how they operate - what and who they control, how they spin, what scares them, what they can get away with, what they can't.  New battlefronts have opened.  We won a LOT more than ever before.  They were small wins.  They didn't change the loss in the end.  They changed the landscape.  More people know how the system works than ever before.  More people are angry about it than there have been since Vietnam.  They won't change the system.  But they might fuel the wrecking ball.  And they will change the landscape of the next round.

We will do this again.  And again.  Some of us will get smarter and more organized, some of us will get dumber and more manipulable.  We will win one day.  It will seem like a big win.  It will be followed by more losses and more wins.  The game will continue.

We will get used to this.  We will make participation faster and easier.  We will get everyone so used to this game that they understand the pattern intuitively - that we become players.  They will try to prevent this.  They will succeed some and fail some.  They will watch us.  They will corrupt some and remove some.  The system will keep going.  The landscape will change.

Based on Super Tuesday's most recent new totals:  Clinton 587, Sanders 397

4,763 total delegates - 794 superdelegates = 3969 total delegates

Bernie needs (3969/2 - 397) = 1588 of the remaining  (3969 - 587 - 397) = 2985 delegates to win a majority.  That's (1588 / 2985) = 53.2% of the remaining states needed for a majority in pledged delegates - not considering superdelegates.

Assuming we need a large enough margin to avoid superdelegates blatantly deciding the race, say 55% of the vote, then that's (3969*(x/100) - 397) delegates needed out of 2985, where x is the percentage-win needed.  Obama won in pledged delegates by only 51% before he got enough superdelegates to switch sides and finish the race.  That's (3969*(51/100) - 397) / 2985 = 54.5% of the remaining delegates that need to be won by Sanders.   But if Sanders needs a bigger margin, let's say 55%, then he needs (3969*(55/100) - 397) / 2985 = **59.8%** of the remaining delegates.  Adjust as you see fit for whatever margin you think is necessary to convince superdelegates to not go against the popular vote. 10% margin = 66.5% needed.

(And pessimists who think ALL the superdelegates will vote Clinton as the establishment throws its collective weight at us: we'll need (3969/2 + 794) / 2985 = 93.1% of the remaining delegates, so - best hope that doesn't happen.)

As far as speculation goes then:  it doesn't sound *impossible*, but it sounds daunting.  I guess let's hope the remaining states really can be swung heavily in Bernie's favor.  Better yet, I wonder if there's any way he can pry superdelegates from Hillary's jaws before the popular vote is done.",SandersForPresident,Bernie probably needs 60% of the remaining delegates to win,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/48lovo/bernie_probably_needs_60_of_the_remaining/

Anyway, I'd just like to say this Facebanking tool at: http://www.berniefriendfinder.com/ seems like the perfect solution for me and anyone who is either not a US citizen or just needs a less-intrusive way to contribute.  I would love to see this as the first response to anyone who wants to help, in hopes it encourages that huge swath of people who need a low barrier of entry to participate.

Here's my message:

&gt;Hey, sorry to bother you but I thought I'd do my part in the slightly-intrusive task of reminding fellow Bernie Sanders supporters to get out and vote tomorrow.  The turnout of young people will make or break this campaign (as we tend to have upwards of 80% support vs Hillary), and the nomination could still go either way right now.  As such, any small part you can play in helping to push your friends and family out to the polls can make a big difference.
&gt;
&gt;We share a mutual friend, found through http://www.berniefriendfinder.com/, as well as mutual support for Bernie, so I hope you don't mind the reach-out.  And if you see this message, I hope it helps motivate you to get out and vote tomorrow!  Here's all the info you'll need to do so:
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;We're projected to ""lose"" tomorrow, but don't get discouraged. Even without a majority, by just outperforming the expectations we will still be in a very good place to take the nomination when more Bernie-leaning states come in.  Remember, the delegates are proportional - so every vote counts.  Actually, tomorrow your vote might count for more than any other part of the political process: in South Carolina, for instance, only 7% of the population voted in the Democratic primary, giving those few who voted a ton of influence as far as these things go.  A group of friends and family - with their friends and family - and you have the power to actually change a chunk of this big political game.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, hope you get out and vote tomorrow, and we take this nomination.  Winning this season relies almost entirely on young people getting involved in this political system - as broken and convoluted as it might appear at times.  For the first time in decades, we have the numbers to decide these elections, if we rise up and use it.  Let's not wait another 8 years - let's get the candidate we want Now!

Hope this can help in any small way.  Fingers crossed for tomorrow

I nervously flicked between feeds and news sources, trying to inform myself - or maybe just to distract myself - as the numbers trickled-in and the race got closer.  I desperately wanted each new result to be the one that finally overtook Hillary - that finally proved it's Bernie's time, that change was coming.  I found myself calculating the % of remaining districts needed to win, looking-up the demographics of undecided precincts, trying to hold out hope for a win.  I wanted this to be the moment - the inflection point - the change.

Truth is, it was.  But it wasn't flashy - it wasn't some big win that forces the media to finally recognize our side. It wasn't some euphoric victory filled with inspiring speeches like the Obama campaign.  We tied.  We lost.  We took another small blow.

But we'll keep going.

I realized after a certain point of staring at the results that it didn't really matter if we won.  It would be seen as a tie either way.  If we won by 5%, it would be a ""narrow win for Bernie"", emphasizing Hillary's lead in the general polls.  If we trounced her completely, it would be a story explaining her already-pledged delegates.  That moment when the world realizes - when everything changes all at once - it's never going to come.

But change *has* come. 

And it's building, at the slow even pace it always has.

We may never feel like it's here.  Even if we get Bernie to the presidency, and we spend a brief moment reveling in the victory, the next day the story will be about the mountain of work involved ousting a republican congress.  There will always be a mountain to climb.  We will always be battered with rocks and buffeted by storms, we'll reach the top and see yet a higher peak, we'll slide down a slope and hike back up.

But that's the change that has really happened.  The days of seeking the ""win"" are over.  Those days expecting it to change things - expecting someone else to change things.  Real change doesn't come from cheers and speeches and words and laws.  Real change builds - and it does it slowly, individually, personally.

I've changed, since the days when I saw politics as nothing more than a corrupted system that should be replaced.  From the days when it took someone of Obama's caliber to make me even tune-in to such a tiresome system.  I pay attention now, I see the patterns, I watch the game, I learn the rules.

I dont know how these attacks work well enough to know if the defender's processing power even matters (if it can simply ""fill up the bandwidth"", jamming all communication), and I don't know whether this DDoS merely gives the miner a low probability of receiving his message soon (so the delay is not strategically perfect).  I suspect that naively all pings sent will be received eventually by the defender, who will read them in order, so the only way to delay their block propagation message (""good message"") is to send as many pings before it as possible. If so then the processing power + bandwidth of the attacker vs the defender's processing power should matter - since if the defender could read the pings faster than they're sent it doesn't matter.  I also expect it depends on the pinging algorithm being used and message filtration, but let's just wave our hands at that for now.  Likewise, ignore server/network stuff and just assume these two are directly connected (equivalently, the server is also a mining node). Then in general:  is this a O(1) to O(1) ratio between the processing powers?   Does it have some ratio?  And how good could we get it in the defender's favor?

e.g. An attacker has &lt;50% of the total computing power, but mines with perfect efficiency - never repeating the same nonce twice by incrementing it each time.  He also doesn't bother updating the transactions in his block or the timestamp - he just wants to calculate as fast as possible.

Meanwhile, the &gt;50% regular users are completely unorganized and just pick random nonces each time and try those (no mining pool in this case, or changing their timestamp/transactions so frequently it's effectively random).

My question is how much of an advantage does this get the attacker?  I'm assuming it's not stopped by something (e.g. mandatory timestamp interval for submitted block), but even if it is - how bad is the above theoretic situation?

It's an important question since before the blockchain online anonymous voting - where the participant can verify and trust the system works and their vote was counted correctly - was believed to be impossible (at least, you can have max 2 of ""online"", ""anonymous"" and ""verifiable"". e.g. German pirate party's LiquidDemocracy creators seem to think this).  I'm betting  the blockchain changes it though.  

Particular problems:

-- Even supposing we have an ID service that can link 1 person to 1 vote, how do you keep this anonymous?  How do you prevent people from using this as a way to confirm their vote to others for vote-buying/coercion purposes?

-- How do we handle the reality that individual PCs are very susceptible to hacking (actually for that matter - how is that handled by cryptocurrency transactions in general?  What stops some hacker from taking over my PC and waiting for me to sign a transaction, then silently changing the address/amount?) 

-- How do you design the system so the voting method is fully open and verifiable (contract?) and all participants have voted correctly and one-vote-per-person (ID service confirming all IDs are unique to different people?)

- {Mihai Alisie, founder of Ethereum.org}

If this is true for Ripple - and more generally, for most/all other coins - what is the cost comparison?  To enable the same features Ripple does, for instance, in an Ethereum contract - what would be the comparative cost?  Vitalik has predicted there won't be One Currency to Rule Them All - there are tradeoffs with each one.  Are some of these other currencies going to be inherently more efficient at certain tasks than Ethereum?

If so, why not just have ""hard-coded"" coins for each task (as we generally kinda do already).  Sure, these coins wouldn't interact with each other like Ethereum contracts do, but could that be an overestimation of the need for variety and interact-ability of contracts?  If some task is needed - e.g. online crypto storage - that uses Ethereum contracts and has a large enough market, then why not create a hard-coded coin that does just that - ditching unneeded flexibility in favor of efficiency?

And if Ethereum might be more efficient than a lot of these coins - despite (or because of) its turing-completeness - then how can we calculate this / compare these fairly?  

(It's also possible my concept of ""efficiency"" isn't really relevant - since a bigger coin like Ethereum would probably still be more profitable for miners/users than a smaller coin that's more ""efficient"", even if a greater percentage of funds are needed for each transaction in the big coin)",ethereum,Question on Cost-Effectiveness of replacing other coins,http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3i5x6l/question_on_costeffectiveness_of_replacing_other/

**Q: By what means is the root-practice to be performed?**

A: Only by sitting in meditation – for it is accomplished by Dhyana (Ch’an) and samádhi (ting). The Dhyana-paramita Sutra says:

‘Dhyana and samádhi are essential to the search for the sacred knowledge of the Buddhas; for, without these, the thoughts remain in tumult and the roots of goodness suffer damage.‘

**Q: Please describe Dhyana and samádhi.**

A:

When wrong thinking ceases, that is Dhyana;
When you sit contemplating your original nature, that is samádhi – for indeed that original nature is your eternal mind.
By samádhi, you withdraw your minds from their surroundings, thereby making them impervious to the eight winds, that is to say, impervious to:

Gain and loss,

Calumny and eulogy,

Praise and blame,

Sorrow and joy.

By concentrating in this way, even ordinary people may enter the state of Buddhahood.

How can that be so?

The Sutra of the bodhisattva-Precepts says:

‘All beings who observe the Buddha-precept thereby enter Buddhahood.’

Other names for this are ‘deliverance’, ‘gaining the further shore’, ‘transcending the six states of mortal being ‘overleaping the three worlds’,’ or becoming a mighty Bodhisattva, an omnipotent sage, a conqueror’!
