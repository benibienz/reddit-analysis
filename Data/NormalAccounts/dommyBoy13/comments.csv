56,"While I agree that the Bruno experiment hasn't worked out. It was a low risk/high reward move (like Bennett) and I'm ok with that.

Saying Carroll is a disappointment is kind of unfair to Masai, Carroll fills a huge need for us, and was probably the best available in free agency to do it. It's not Masai's fault he was injured in the *one* season we've had him so far. I want to see how he plays this year before I call him disappointing. 

Lowry/DeMar and JV were Colangelo's guys but Ujiri got them to stay at good contracts (We'll see about DeMar's). He also turned Bargnani into a good draft pick for us, and Vasquez into Norman Powell (who has been a pretty good decision by him) and another first rd pick. 

Biyombo and Scola were low risk/high reward pickups who turned out to be vaulable. Biyombo for his defence, Scola as a veteran leader who then led us to our best season in franchise history. He also got a winning PG in Cory. 

At the time he traded Gay we were a mediocre at best team, and the plan was to go for Wiggins, who would have been a legit marketable star. When the scrapped Lowry deal to NY and the loss to Brooklyn happened, he made the decision to tank but to try to win games and made moves accordingly. 

He's made a couple bad moves in his tenure but I think overall he's done a lot more good to get us to where we are. ",2016-10-23 16:58:45+00:00,d94ehbo,3.0,t1_d94cdtu,2978,torontoraptors

I did try out Android in a tablet and I wasn't a huge fan. I had a Galaxy Tab 2 and the OS seemed very clunky to me. I like the simplicity of iOS much more.

I do understand the outrage though, it just doesn't really apply to me. 

I've never tried bluetooth headphones so I was more wondering about those. I know it's all speculation but what do you think would give better quality, a medium-high end pair of headphones plugged into the lightning-3.5mm dongle or a digital bluetooth pair? Would the digital sound transfer through the dongle, or would the headphones have to be digital for that to work?

468,"Again, I'm not trying to say that JV is a better defender than Biz, because he isn't. The original comment I replied to was saying that Biyombo is playing better than JV. I said he's playing better defence, yes. But let's wait until our guys get some games together before we start thinking about a trade. 

When did we last have an opposing centre kill us that we had the option of the two? I don't really think it's happened since before JV's injury. I would hope Casey would put in who the better fit is, if it's a back to the basket big man JV is a better choice, if it's a quicker more athletic 5 then Biz should play.

Of course DeRozan's defensive numbers will get better with him not having to guard the LeBrons and Jimmy Butlers of the league, that shouldn't be a question. But in this case, both JV and Biz have had a lot of opportunity to start games so they've both played extensive minutes with essentially the same personnel around them. The only way we can really accurately differentiate the two is by the numbers. Two people can look at the same play in different ways, you might say JV wasn't quick enough to a spot, I might say the defender in front of him got beat too easily, it's all a matter of perspective which explains a lot of grief against referees. 

I think JV earned his contract with his play. He was 2nd in the league in FG% last year, averaged 16 and 12 last yer per 36, that definitely warrants a good contract (and pretty team-friendly considering the cap increase). Sure he's a fan favourite but Toronto fans (for the most part) like certain types of players. Ones that play hard and give 100% (Amir Johnson, Charles Oakley, JYD, Mo Pete etc...). When Vince gave up, we turned on him quickly, when Bargnani wasn't living up to the expectations we turned on him, even when Ross was in a shooting slump this whole sub basically turned on him. I remember Bargs getting drafted and everyone was mad that we took him, then we were promised the second coming of Dirk and for a while he looked like he might be so we embraced the idea, then when we realized what we were actually getting, everyone wanted him out. I can't think of many players that were more hated by fans because of lack of consistency in his days here.",2016-01-04 22:36:16+00:00,cym1xnx,11.0,t1_cym08lm,2441,torontoraptors
469,"It's hard to compare any 2 players on different teams defensively because of schemes, the players around them and the competition they face. But when they're on the same team it's a little easier. Biz looks better because he's more athletic and plays with more energy but JV is quietly putting up similar numbers. For whatever reason, the team is better with him on the floor. What he provides offensively trumps what Biz brings defensively. I'm not saying by any means that JV is as good a defender as him by any means. But JV isn't as far off as you're making it seem. JV right now overall is a better player than Biz, and that's why he's making a few extra dollars.",2016-01-04 21:48:17+00:00,cylzx7o,9.0,t1_cylzfp0,672,torontoraptors
470,"I agree that he's a better defender, but ""it's not even close"" is a bit of stretch. 

Biyombo's DRtg is **100**, JV is **103**. Biyombo averages **2.2** blocks per36, JV is **1.2**. Biyombo also averages just one more rebound per 36 (**13.7** vs **12.6**). Other than the blocks, it's pretty damn close in terms of defensive stats. And even blocks aren't the best representation of a player's defensive abilities. 

On offense JV is much better and it's not even close. **117**Ortg vs **112**, **23**pts per 36 vs **12**, **54%** shooting vs **49%** and **77%** FT vs **67%.** And that's without taking into account JV is **+5.1** vs Biyombo's **-1.7**.

So while Biyombo is definitely more athletic and *APPEARS* to be leaps and bounds ahead of JV defensively, it's pretty close, but JV's offence is way more valuable to this team. Especially when people complain about Lowry and DeRozan ISO ball, it's good to have a reliable big man to throw the ball into and know he can score for you. Biz is good at what he does, but JV isn't too far behind. I'll take above average defence and good offence over good defence and bad offence any day.

I really don't want to sound like Wenger, but our guys coming back from injury (Alexis, Wilshere, Welbeck) will be almost like new signings up front.

Or at least relevant in the West, they're finally getting the players again, hopefully management can make the right decisions for them.

I think that might be a good thing for JV and either DeMar or whoever we get to replace him if he leaves in free agency. I'm really interested in seeing what Masai does this season/off season, we have some money and picks but a borderline superstar to try to re-sign.

When Patterson wasn't hitting a shot and air balling 3s people were more willing to forget that. Ross is still very important to our team, his defence has been very good this season for the most part. His passing has gotten much better over the last couple weeks and the threat of his 3point shot helps immensely with floor spacing. It's not really his fault that he doesn't actually get the shots very often with Lowry and DeRozan on the floor.

If your problem is the fact that they paid him $11 mil, that's not his fault at all. If someone offered you more money than you used to get and probably more than you thought you would to do your job, any of us would take it. Blame Masai if the contract is what you're angry about, not Ross. 

Am I happy with the team? Ya, I am. I don't think we're a contender because of how good the top of the west is but in the East we definitely are. We've beaten the Cavs, Spurs, Thunder, Clippers, Pacers and took the Warriors to the limit twice (with Ross getting playing time).

581,"There's a pretty simple calculation you can do to get a really good idea of the range. You want to be between 55-65% of your heart rate reserve.

220 - Your age (let's assume 25 for simplicity)

220-25=195 (max HR)

195 x .55 = 107            

195 x .65 = 127

So for a 25 year old client, the target heart rate range would be between 107bpm and 127bpm for the most effective fat burning. These numbers are just a general idea for the average person, for a trained athlete it could be higher and for a beginner it could be a little lower.

583,"If you're planning on using a treadmill to lose weight (specifically fat), you're much better off walking than running. The body needs oxygen to burn and process fat so you will burn a higher percentage of fat per calorie when you have more oxygen.

For example:

Let's say you walk on the treadmill for 1 hour and burn 500 calories, around 60% (300) of the total calories you burn will be from fat storages in the body. If you run on the treadmill for an hour and you burn 650 calories, somewhere around 40-45% of the calories (260-290) will be from the fat stores. If you want to maximize the efficiency of FAT burning, you want to stay in your target heart rate which is around 65% of your heart rate reserve (the gym should have a chart or someone to help you find the number). Keep the treadmill at a walking pace but increase the incline if you need to increase your heart rate, lower the incline if you need to decrease it.

607,"Ok, so I was a big fan of Ross coming into the season, I look at the tools he has and I always said to myself that he just HAS to be good NBA player. A SG at 6'7 that has good lateral quicks and a legit 3 point shot should be playing a major part of a teams success. I don't see anyone really denying the talent.

His problem that we can see, is his mental toughness and mentality overall. It's definitely what seems to be holding him back, but sometimes a player just takes a little bit longer to become more mature. Ross is 24, it's still possible that he turns it around. 

Remember James Johnson? The guy who everyone praises right now and calls for Casey's head when he doesn't play was not always the most mature of players. At 24 he was suspended by the team for an ""incident causing the team plan to be delayed"". Demarcus Cousins at 23 amassed 16 technicals to get suspended. Gerald Green at 24 was bouncing around Europe/China/D League, and has now made himself into a good bench player. 

I'm not saying that Ross definitely will turn into what these players have become, I'm just saying that there is still a chance that he matures and becomes the player we know he can be. He's missed a few games this season, and we know last season he wasn't 100%. Let's see what he can do if and when he gets to 100% because he does have the tools to be the quintessential 3 and D guy off the bench for us. I really hope he does because we need his 3 point shooting off the bench, his D has been pretty good this season for the most part, maybe the shot will come around like Carroll and Pat's have. If not, then he still turned out better than Hoffa ",2015-11-24 03:32:53+00:00,cxazs7l,1.0,t3_3twqxk,77790,torontoraptors

I didn't want him to be retained, but when I look at it I understand where Masai was coming from. He's on the last guaranteed year of his contract, we can let this play out and make a decision on him in the off season. It could be a good pitch to Demar (if the plan is to sign him to a big money deal) to allow him some sort of say in the coaching situation for next year. We brought in good offensive assistant coaches to help with ball movement and creativity, but it doesn't do much good when you spend more time on the road and don't get to practice new things. 

From what I've seen and read, Masai and the majority of the team seem to be happy with Casey and chemistry and continuity is very underrated in this league. Firing coaches every 4 years doesn't help create a winning culture, just look at Sacramento. 

Again, I'm not saying that Casey is the coach we need, because he still has a lot to do to be a great coach in this league. But from a business standpoint and creating the winning environment that Masai keeps talking about, it makes sense to see out the season with him and then make a decision on his future afterwards.

If he wins us 5 games with his defence (and I would bet it would be more than that) then we're up around that 50 win range again. Hawks are still well coached and play the best team ball in the East but it's hard to go on another run like they did last year. The Wiz have Wall and Beal who can be a really tough 1 and 2 to defend, but I think losing a veteran in Pierce will prove to be a big loss. The Heat, I really don't know what to expect, but I'm not sold on a bench relying on Gerald Green, Amare and a rookie to score points. The Bucks I think are close, but they're just a ""potential"" threat. If they all reach their potential then they'll be fighting for a top 4, but if not I wouldn't be shocked to see them fighting for 8th. 

Lowry looks legit right now, like pre all star break Lowry and IF he can stay healthy and maintain that level of play for the whole season I could see us pushing Chicago for the number 2 spot. ",2015-10-16 21:19:28+00:00,cw2b360,7.0,t1_cw2a01j,1750,nba

And it might be the homer in me, but if Lowry's weight loss means he can sustain the first half of his last season for a whole season I think we're neck and neck with the Hawks. 

The nice thing is, even though we're not guaranteed a top 4 finish for winning the division anymore, we still get to play the Knicks, nets, and 76ers 12 times a year.

It could have just been JV not protecting the ball, you can see there was an initial cut by Demarre and for all we know, the play could have been a read and react off of that.

797,"Ok, let's say Wade is rested (because of past injury) and not injured, he still hasn't played more than 69 regular season games in the past 4 years. It's still games he's missing that will affect the team. It's the same thing that the Spurs rest Duncan/Manu/Parker at times, they're conceding a higher seed to be more ready for the playoffs. When he's on the floor he's great, I'm not denying that. 

I still think Whiteside is a question mark, we saw a really good young player in basically half a season. I want to see him do it over a full season before I'm willing to call him legit. Remember Jeremy Lin and Tyreke Evans took the league by storm when they came in too. 

Dragic and Bosh are really good, I think they could definitely be All Stars in the east. Deng is solid as a 3 an D guy but he's just about average at that position now. 

I wouldn't say their bench is unreal though. Other than Chalmers, they're either unproven or on the decline. Nobody knows what we're going to get from STAT night after night. He's played a combined 60 games in the last 2 seasons and averaged 20 minutes. Chris Andersen isn't going to put up points but he'll play good D. McRoberts isn't exactly going to be a huge scorer either. He'll be a good stretch 4 but that's about it. Haslem brings energy but isn't anywhere close to what he used to be. Gerald Green might be their best player off the bench in terms of consistency and production and that's not anything to get TOO excited about. Winslow has the potential to be good, but it's hard to project how well a rookie is going to do. 

I think they'll be better than last year, and they have potential to be a top 3 seed I think if everything goes well for them. But I'll take the Raptors, Wiz and Hawks over them right now. ",2015-09-16 18:43:33+00:00,cv3s662,3.0,t1_cv3n9q3,7171,torontoraptors

Winslow has a high ceiling, but still a rookie who might be relied on heavily if Wade goes down.

807,"We only have 2 real sports programming channels, TSN (owned by Bell) and Sportsnet (owned by Rogers). These channels have sub channels, TSN 2,3,4,5 and Sportsnet 1, World and 360. What we're talking about is that curling is being put on the main channels where other sports (NBA and MLS especially) are being moved to the channels that you have to pay for and therefore are not as available to as many households. This has little to do with the advertising because either way, TSN and Sportsnet are making their money off of advertising for the sport.

I guarantee if the roles were reversed and the Raptors or TFC were put on TSN 1 and curling was moved to TSN 2 their ratings would drop based on the sheer number of people that wouldn't be able to watch it. 

I'm agreeing that they're being kept on those main channels because of the ratings, but they're getting the ratings because they're put on those channels.

That might be enough to entice a good player in free agency. There's gonna be a bunch of teams going all in for Durant and all but one are gonna miss out. 

I'd rather keep a winning team on the court and if Durant becomes a viable option then we make moves accordingly. I'm pretty sure he'll want to help out OKC with a sign and trade if he does decide to leave (which I don't think he will) because of everything the organization has done for him and he seems to be very loyal. Then it's better to have the assets to be able to facilitate a deal like that. And a big expiring like Demar could be attractive, as well as a young, cheap player with potential like Ross. I don't think we need to rush into any trade right now. Masai has done a good job getting us flexibility and picks while still staying competitive.

997,"By out of position I mean he was asked to defend the bigger, stronger wing on the opposing team. He's quick, but not nearly strong enough to match up with some of the ""3s"" in the league. Once it became clear that we would put DeMar on the weaker wing I think we should have put a defensive stopper (James Johnson) in the starting lineup. I don't think he should be starting if he and DeRozan are the wings, which is why it's probably better suited for him to come off the bench. Hopefully his mentality changes. It's happened before, but now he's gotta stop living on potential and actually do it. Call me crazy, but I think he can",2015-07-08 16:49:28+00:00,cswcm6s,11.0,t1_cswbfai,1790,nba

1000,"I'm actually a huge fan of Ross. I think his skill set is well suited for our 6th man role. He CAN shoot, CAN drive and has shown he CAN play defence. His head isn't where it should be and maybe its because he was playing out of position, maybe because he was the 4th/5th option on offence in the starting 5, but I think a guy with his athleticism and shooting stroke could benefit from playing against other bench players instead of starting wings. Worst case scenario is he's a really cheap option for now  ",2015-07-08 15:16:58+00:00,csw8zl2,9.0,t1_csw8pbq,450,nba

My hunch on the Knicks is just basically a gut feeling. More of a bold prediction than anything, I just see it happening. ",2015-07-08 15:05:34+00:00,csw8k3u,7.0,t1_csw827b,822,nba
