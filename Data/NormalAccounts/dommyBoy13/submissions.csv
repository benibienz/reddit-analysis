When they look at the replay to see when the whistle was blown, could they not see that the ball was released [BEFORE 0.7](http://imgur.com/jQvGlc5) seconds? They should have at least given us 0.9 if they claim that we called the timeout before the shot. 

I usually don't like arguing about refs, especially in a game we had no business being in but I really don't understand what their logic was.  ",torontoraptors,Not to be THAT guy but cmon NBA.,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/3xavet/not_to_be_that_guy_but_cmon_nba/

I was having a talk with a friend last night while playing some FIFA about the lineups we use. And I'm curious to hear some other lineups.

So let's assume you're playing online with the current Arsenal squad. What's your preferred formation and lineup?

Here's mine:

Cech

Debuchy   Kos    Mert    Gibbs

Wilshere     Ramsey

Walcott   Ozil   Alexis

Giroud
