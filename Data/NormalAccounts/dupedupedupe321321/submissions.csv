I messed up on one spot so I pressed undo, ctrl+z. I accidentally pressed it twice, and for some reason it undid all 30 minutes worth of work. Why did it get rid of so many tris? It treated the entirey of the extruding/filling as one action, because the second thing it undid was switching from edit mode to object mode.",blender,Lost a crapton of work from 1 undo?,https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/3z0avs/lost_a_crapton_of_work_from_1_undo/
