20,"Here you go @FERNLY:

I mentioned my mentor, Bruce Metzger, in a recent post.  In this blast from the past, I reprint a post I did almost exactly four years ago, in response to a question that I was then asked about how Metzger, a devoted Christian and minister of the church, responded to the fact that I (one of his closest students) lost my faith.   The question generated a series of posts on related topics, but here is the one where I actually answer the question:

*************************************************************************************

I have come now, by an unusually circuitous route, to answer the question that got me started in talking about my relationship with Bruce Metzger, my work for the NRSV Bible translation committee, my view of the NRSV as a translation, the textual problems of Luke 22:19-20 and 22:43-44 and, well sundry other things. The reader’s question was how Metzger responded to my loss of faith. When I first got to know him, I was a strong evangelical Christian. In the years before he died, I had become an agnostic. How did he respond to that.

After all that I’ve written in these posts, I’m afraid the direct answer will be a bit of a disappointment.  The answer is: I don’t know.

Metzger and I never talked about either my faith or his.  He was my teacher and I was his student, and we talked almost exclusively about scholarship:  New Testament studies, the history of earliest Christianity, the textual tradition of the New Testament.  We did not have a pastoral relationship but an academic one.   I don’t know if Metzger ever had…

I don’t know if Metzger ever had a pastoral relationship with any of his students, but I somewhat doubt it.   He was their teacher, not their pastor or counselor.

I know this seems weird to outsiders, since, well, isn’t faith the point?  Well, it’s not really the point for academics, whether they are Christians or not (except for fundamentalists and very conservative evangelicals).   I taught for four years at Rutgers University and have now taught for twenty-four years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and have been an adjunct for years at Duke university, all twenty-eight years in  departments of religious studies with faculty colleagues who were experts in various religions and various aspects of religion.  Some of these colleagues have been Christians, some Jews, some Muslims, some agnostics, some – a variety of other things.  In all these years, I have never, ever, had a conversation with a colleague about my personal religious views.  Never.   Why?  I suppose because we are not a church but a secular institution of higher learning, and faith commitments are irrelevant to scholarship.   I know, it may seem weird, but there it is.

One might think that it would be different with Metzger.  He taught in a theological seminary that trained Christian ministers – a very different environment from a secular state university.  True enough.  But in his relationship with the students he was training to be scholars, he interacted in view of scholarship, and it was the research that mattered, not the personal faith commitments.

And this is not unusual to Metzger.  Just as an example:  over the years I have co-authored a book with Gordon Fee, a well-known Pentecostal preacher and evangelist who is principally known as a very, very fine evangelical Christian scholar of the New Testament; and I have written one book and co-edited two editions of another with Michael Holmes, a senior and very well established New Testament scholar who teaches at an evangelical college, Bethel (Minnesota), and who is himself a committed, conservative evangelical.  I have known both of these people over twenty-five years, and have worked very closely with them (Mike and I have not only written and edited together; we have played golf and spent lots of time at conferences together and so on; we are close).  And we have never, ever had a conversation about my faith.  Or loss of faith.  It just isn’t an issue.

You may wonder: how could it NOT be an issue?  Well, simply because it is irrelevant to our shared interests.  We haven’t talked about my father, my favorite novels, or my political views either.  Our shared interests are things like the manuscript tradition of the New Testament, the quotations of the New Testament in the Greek church fathers, the interpretation of the biblical texts, and so on.  These are academic issues, not faith issues.

I assume Metzger did know that I had a transition in my faith.   I don’t know what he thought about it.  I do know that he read Misquoting Jesus, and he told me, at least, that he liked it very much.  Whether he was just being nice, I don’t know.  He himself was a faithful Christian to the end.  In all the years I knew him, I don’t know that he changed his theological views one iota.  As with many conservative Christians, he was more invested in his relationship with God than with his doctrines.   And he had no problems acknowledging the mysteries of the universe that could not be solved and were best left in God’s hands.  He may have thought that the faith of his students and colleagues were best left that way as well.  So the short answer – after all these posts – I don’t know what he thought about my faith, either before or after I lost it.",2016-09-19 09:47:54+00:00,d7sxxue,2.0,t1_d7soiar,24109.0,atheismplus
