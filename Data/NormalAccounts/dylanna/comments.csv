5,"They were very good friends. They were both in a literature/writing club called The Inklings, and Tolkien is credited as the one who converted Lewis to Christianity (though Lewis did not join the same church).

The whole ""C.S. Lewis hates the LOTR"" rumor is patently false. His essay [""The Dethronement of Power""](https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=GEWXQbASXZUC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22the+dethronement+of+power%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjflcuw9KrQAhVJnJQKHTd8DaQQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20dethronement%20of%20power%22&amp;f=false) is a glowing review and strong defense of the trilogy. Of the characters, he wrote:

&gt; ...no individual, and no species, seems to exist only for the good of the plot. All exist in their own right and are worth creating for their mere flavor even if they had been irrelevant. Treebeard would have served another author (if any other could have conceived him) for a whole book.

He then goes on to say that

&gt; I have no doubt that the book will soon take its place among the indispensables.

So yeah, Lewis loved the LOTR.

As for Tolkien's dislike of the Narnia books, that seemed to stem from [his dislike of allegories](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/411971-i-cordially-dislike-allegory-in-all-its-manifestations-and-always). He thought direct allegories were too limited, where one thing in the book is a parallel for another thing in the real world. There was no room for layers of interpretation. He didn't deny that allegories could be found in his own work, but he didn't write it that way. Readers can find their own parallels.",2016-11-15 14:42:04+00:00,da1a0v2,2.0,t1_da126ti,20188.0,tumblr

I think the main similarity between us is the tendency to idealize love to a dangerous degree. Like, she insists on forcing her relationships into this intensely romantic narrative that she's dreamed about her whole life and it keeps biting her in the ass because real life is far messier than a fairy tale. I just wanna shake her because I've been there, done that, burned the t-shirt. It seems you have, too.

92,"**Article, for those who don't wanna click away from Reddit:**

&gt; For years, the University of Augsburg in Bavaria, southern Germany, has played host to a very special visitor: a little ginger cat whose only mission is to give students soothing snuggles.
&gt; 
&gt; To be clear, the cat hasn’t been hired by the university’s staff. She just started popping on to campus when she was one year old, realised she liked hanging around with students, and has been paying the university a visit every day since then.
&gt; 
&gt; Her owner lives just nearby and has no issue with the cat spending her days helping out the students, who call the cat Sammy or The Campus Cat.
&gt; 
&gt; Sammy now knows many of the students, and will always run to them to sit on their lap and cuddle up.
&gt; 
&gt; During each daily trip to the campus, Sammy enjoys lounging outside in the sun. But her favourite spot in the library, where she can check in on stressed out students revising for exams and offer support.
&gt; 
&gt; In short: Sammy is the hero everyone needs right now. We all deserve a Sammy.

&gt; Why should a man be scorned if, finding himself in prison, he tries to get out and go home? Or if, when he cannot do so, he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison-walls? 

The prisoner has already tried to get out. He didn't just sit there wishing and then gave up the dream of freedom when he found that he couldn't.

Do you think that social change happens because people came up with an idea out of nowhere, carried out the idea, and *immediately* succeeded? No. Every major revolution happens at the end of a long parade of people who have already struggled against the system and *lost*. Those first generation dreamers fought for their dreams and failed, but they didn't just curl up and surrender. If they couldn't win, they kept dreaming and talking of victory, passing on the dream to others, refusing to just accept the impossible.

My country was under Spanish subjugation for 300 years. When we learn about our revolutionary heroes, we also learn about the stories that they read that inspired them. Our national hero, Jose Rizal, was a lover of myths, legends, and folktales--stories of magic. He collected them, even translated and illustrated them. Whatever hope he got from those stories, he used it to fuel his fight. He was executed long before our country was freed. He was a prisoner who tried to get out but failed--but he kept dreaming and he was able to pass on the dream of freedom, and that made all the difference.",2016-11-09 22:00:58+00:00,d9tg9j6,4.0,t1_d9teduw,2268.0,Fantasy

*Nowhere* in those quotes do Le Guin and Tolkien say that because you read fantasy you can't be proactive in the real world. I read the complete essays and they don't say that there either. Le Guin is an activist and has participated in peace marches, but beyond that she made the deliberate choice to populate her stories with people of color and varying sexual and gender orientations. Tolkien fought in a freaking war. Point out to me where they advocate being passive.

Also this?

&gt; Yes, exactly. First you need to dream. Then you need to do something about it. Which was my point.

156,"The conversation is already open, and the quotes are about reclaiming the word ""escape"" from its negative connotations. The Tolkien quote had to be shortened by a lot, but I included the link for people to read it in full because the whole passage is quite insightful:

&gt; I have claimed that Escape is one of the main functions of fairy-stories, and since I do not
disapprove of them, it is plain that I do not accept the tone of scorn or pity with which
“Escape” is now so often used: a tone for which the uses of the word outside literary criticism
give no warrant at all. In what the misusers are fond of calling Real Life, Escape is evidently
as a rule very practical, and may even be heroic. In real life it is difficult to blame it, unless it
fails; in criticism it would seem to be the worse the better it succeeds. Evidently we are faced
by a misuse of words, and also by a confusion of thought. Why should a man be scorned if,
finding himself in prison, he tries to get out and go home? Or if, when he cannot do so, he
thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison-walls? The world outside has not
become less real because the prisoner cannot see it. In using escape in this way the critics
have chosen the wrong word, and, what is more, they are confusing, not always by sincere
error, the Escape of the Prisoner with the Flight of the Deserter. Just so a Party-spokesman
might have labelled departure from the misery of the Führer's or any other Reich and even
criticism of it as treachery. In the same way these critics, to make confusion worse, and so to
bring into contempt their opponents, stick their label of scorn not only on to Desertion, but
on to real Escape, and what are often its companions, Disgust, Anger, Condemnation, and
Revolt. Not only do they confound the escape of the prisoner with the flight of the
deserter; but they would seem to prefer the acquiescence of the “quisling” to the resistance
of the patriot. To such thinking you have only to say “the land you loved is doomed” to
excuse any treachery, indeed to glorify it.",2016-11-09 20:47:46+00:00,d9tcm5d,6.0,t1_d9tc6mb,519.0,Fantasy

160,"&gt; Fantasy can create a platform to explore ideas and possibilities that the reader wouldn't normally have access to. 
&gt; 

True. If you would forgive a personal anecdote:

I grew up in a *very* conservative family and culture and my parents and teachers never talked to me about sex (except to tell me not to do it until I'm married), let alone the intricacies of sexual orientation and gender identity. My first encounter with the concept of sexual/gender fluidity was in *The Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K. Le Guin which I read in my early teens. That idea, found in the alien setting of a sci-fi story, caught me at my most receptive mental state, because when I lose myself in a book, I'm very willing to ""just go with it."" I think if I'd learned about non-binary people through, say, the gossips in my neighborhood, my small town ass would have struggled with the concept more. As it was, by the time I went out to the wider world and actually met a non-binary person, I already had the very beginnings of acceptance, and more importantly, an openness to learn more. Fiction can be disarming that way.",2016-11-09 19:14:27+00:00,d9t7xz1,4.0,t1_d9t6adc,2017.0,Fantasy
161,"&gt; In fiction, we can try on new selves, test out solutions to problems we are struggling with, see what it would feel like to handle them one way or another. 

In addition to this, fiction can also help us see reality from a fresher perspective and reveal truths about our own world that we are unable to see until we encounter them in a different setting. C.S. Lewis writes:

&gt; ""But why,"" some ask, ""why if you have a serious comment to make on the real life of men, must you do it by talking about a phantasmagoric never-never land of your own?"" Because, I take it, one of the main things the author wants to say is that the real life of men is of that mythical and heroic quality. [...] The value of myth is that it takes all the things we know and restores to them the rich significance which has been hidden by the veil of familiarity.

That's from his essay [""The Dethronement of Power,""](https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=GEWXQbASXZUC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) which is a review of Tolkien's LOTR. I don't think Lewis was saying that Tolkien intentionally put direct parallels between the real world and Middle Earth. Maybe some authors do that, and some don't. The point is, we as humans can't help but find those parallels in the stories we love, and we bring back whatever we learned into our reality, whether it's done consciously or not.",2016-11-09 18:43:16+00:00,d9t6erf,2.0,t1_d9t3nup,3306.0,Fantasy

The hands off approach seems nice in theory, but it's unrealistic and irresponsible. If there are only a few hundred individuals in a species left, you can't just do nothing and hope for the best. That's why conservationists take male and female pairs and try to breed them in controlled conditions, where they can be sure that the maximum number of offspring will survive. Meanwhile there's other work being done in lobbying for legislation and increasing awareness so that when the time comes to reintroduce the animals back into nature, there will be a safe habitat for them and laws preventing them from getting hunted.

315,"**Cheetah conservation status:**

&gt; The status of the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) varies widely in the 32 countries listed in this report. All populations are classified as vulnerable or endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and are regulated by the Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) as Apeendix I. There are 13 countries listed in this report where the cheetah has become extinct during the past 40 years. The wild cheetah is nearly extinct in Asia, with approximately 100 cheetah surviving in small pocketed areas through Iran.

**Threats to cheetahs in the wild:**

&gt; The cheetah is threatened by habitat loss through agricultural and industrial expansion; moreover, the animal apparently requires a large area to live in as indicated by its low population densities. The cheetah appears to be less capable than the leopard of coexisting with humans. As such, human interference can disturb the activities, such as hunting and feeding, of cheetah. With 76% of their range consisting of unprotected land, the cheetah are often targeted by farmers and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock. However, cheetahs typically do not prefer livestock for prey. Game hunters may also try to harm cheetah as these carnivores can deprive them of valuable game. Roadkill can be another threat, especially in areas where roads have been constructed near the natural habitat or protected areas. Cases of roadkill involving cheetahs have been reported from Kalmand, Tūrān, and Bafq. The threat is posed by infectious diseases is minor, given the low population densities and hence the minimal chance of infection.

346,"**Excerpt from the article:**

&gt; In recent years, inspired by success at the San Diego Zoo, a number of other zoos have begun raising puppies and cheetah kittens together to help combat the big cats’ stress and focus their wild energy.
&gt; 
&gt; The combination works because the chosen dogs, usually rescue mutts but sometimes pure labradors or shepherds, are a calming influence and are tolerant of kitty play—including tooth and claw.
&gt; 
&gt; Dogs are also great teachers, offering up social cues the cheetahs need to thrive and would normally get from their mother and siblings.

------------------

**More info from [here](http://endangeredspecies.about.com/od/endangeredspeciesconservation/a/How-Dogs-Are-Helping-Cheetahs.htm):**

&gt; 
&gt; Cheetah cubs are paired with canine companions at about 3 or 4 months of age. They first meet on opposite sides of a fence with a keeper walking the dog on a leash. If all goes well, the two animals are able to meet for their first ""play date,"" although both are kept on leashes initially for safety.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We're very protective of our cheetahs, so the introduction is a painfully slow process but a lot of fun,"" Rose-Hinostroza says. ""There are lots of toys and distractions, and they're like two cute little kids who desperately want to play. But cheetahs are instinctively hardwired to feel uneasy so you have to wait and let the cat make the first move.""
&gt; 
&gt; Once the cheetah and dog establish a bond and prove to play well without leashes, they are moved into a shared living space where they spend almost every moment together, except feeding time, when the zoos dogs get to gather, play, and eat together.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The dog is the dominant in the relationship, so if we didn't separate them, the dog would eat all the cheetah's food and we'd have a really skinny cheetah and a really chubby dog,"" explains Rose-Hinostroza.

There's something about his unpolished, imperfect voice that just *utterly* makes sense for a scrappy, out-of-place kid making his determined way among the aristocrats and elites. Hamilton doesn't belong, and he keeps pushing and pushing against his limits, and is there a more perfect way to communicate that friction other than with Lin's voice singing with more technically masterful singers? 

Chris Jackson, for example, is a strong and effortlessly powerful singer, and when he duets with Lin, Lin sounds really young in comparison: eager, but untried. Their voices work so perfectly together for the Washington and Hamilton dynamic. And Leslie, as we all know, is a smooth motherfucker, which only helps cement Burr's frustration that Hamilton is surpassing him when Burr knows, he *knows*, that he can more than compete.

Personally, I'm so glad we have Lin's voice on the cast recording. I know the other Hamiltons are better singers, but hearing Lin just helps me understand the character more.",2016-10-19 16:54:15+00:00,d8yy7hj,1.0,t3_5890vt,35043.0,hamiltonmusical

I’m also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I’m in the seventh year (I’m seventeen). I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about.

Things like that. They like to play with the idea of predestination--both fulfilling it (finding your soulmate and living happily ever after) and subverting it (being happy with someone *not* your soulmate, or having a platonic soulmate).

The ""name on the wrist"" thing is one of the subtropes. So in this alternate universe, if people had the name of their soulmate on one wrist and the name of their nemesis on the other, Alexander Hamilton would probably have Aaron Burr's name on both wrists since their fates are so intertwined (*""my first friend, my enemy""*).",2016-10-18 04:34:03+00:00,d8wthov,2.0,t1_d8wt2bb,801.0,hamiltonmusical

I saw [an insider report](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-inside-story-of-donald-trumps-comedy-central-roast-is-everything-you-thought-it-would-be_us_57fbed42e4b0e655eab6c191) about his 2011 Comedy Central roast that said that that was one of the topics he absolutely demanded as off limits. They weren't allowed to joke that he's not as rich as he claims. The other one is his bankruptcies. He's thin-skinned as hell but those are his biggest sore spots.

Which is why I dearly hope he has somehow seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qdq5R80H7A) of Seth Meyers taunting him after his tax scandal (back when I thought that was the worst shitstorm his campaign would have to weather). Tbh I think Seth Meyers' jokes would stick in his craw worse than the sexual assault allegations, and it's even more delightful because Seth Meyers was also at that Correspondent's Dinner.

&gt; Sometimes they leave a bottle of whiskey too.
&gt; 
&gt; Quite possibly the tamest war ever, yet USA and Sweden have tried their best to make the sides hate each other.

707,"It might be difficult, but trust me when I say that setting firm boundaries is so, so necessary for this type of person. I learned that the hard way.

I had a roommate who was just brimming with mommy issues. To be fair, those were legitimate--every interaction I saw between her and her mom convinced me that the mother was narcissistic. I have a pretty nurturing personality, I guess, so she latched on to me, hard. Waited for my lead on pretty much everything, wanted to go everywhere together, parroted all my opinions and views. Even started doing baby talk around me. It was exhausting, but I had no idea how to create distance because I didn't want her to feel abandoned.

Then she and her mom had a big fight and all the hostility and rebellion that she couldn't express towards her mom got directed at me. She would veer wildly between being needy and self-pitying and open antagonism, even trying to destroy my reputation with our friends. It turned into a shitshow and it took me a while to recover from the fallout.

So trust me, OP, even if it gets awkward to try to push away someone who is clinging too hard, it's really healthy and necessary. Even if you do sympathize with her, no one can stand the heavy toll of being the center of someone's world, and you shouldn't feel bad that you can't. Other people have given good suggestions here, but I just wanted to reassure you that it's okay to assert your need for space.",2016-10-10 08:02:29+00:00,d8lmwvl,1.0,t3_56o5il,40995.0,relationships

926,"Lots of incorrect and half-correct information here, so I finally looked it up and here's what I learned:

* The mosquito injects saliva into the puncture as an anti-coagulant. It keeps the blood flowing freely and stops it from forming clots in the blood vessel or in the mosquito's narrow proboscis.

* The itchiness is due to the body's allergic response to the foreign substance (saliva) in it, like some people have already said. Histamine floods the area and widens the blood vessels to make room for white blood cells to rush in and fight the invader. The resultant swelling disturbs the nearby nerves and causes itching.

* The saliva isn't a numbing agent, nor do mosquitoes suck it back up when they're done feeding. So feel free to smack away. Squash 'em dead.

935,"#Source: [I Have an Opinion on Every Song in “Hamilton”](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elizabeth-logan/i-have-an-opinion-on-ever_b_8223496.html)

I also liked what she said about **""It's Quiet Uptown""**:

&gt; This is the saddest song in the whole show, and it used to be my least favorite, but now it’s my favorite, so let me explain.
&gt; 
&gt; When I first heard this song, I thought it was inexcusably lazy lyric writing. We are told, often, that the Hamiltons’ pain is “unimaginable,” but isn’t it the job of a writer to imagine? Isn’t that what theater is, imaginary struggle made manifest? The phrases “working through” and “going through” and “trying to do,” which are repeatedly paired with that word, “unimaginable,” may rhyme, but they are completely non-specific. This is one of the “moments that the words don’t reach,” it’s something “too terrible to name,” but all I wanted was for Miranda to reach it, to name it, instead of copping out with vague language. The song asks, “can you imagine?” and I wondered if Miranda was asking us to imagine it instead of doing it himself. Overdramatic schmaltz, I said, and put this song aside.
&gt; 
&gt; I. Was. Wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; I had overlooked the essence of Hamilton’s character. He’s a writer. Words are his fiercest weapons, his stock-and-trade, the source of his power. It’s not Miranda who can’t put the sadness into language, it’s Hamilton; that’s how depressed he is. Our guide, our word-playing, rhyming, subtle, subtextual, double-meaning beacon of logic and reason is utterly unable to comprehend the death of his son, rendered speechless. By telling us that he can’t tell us about it, Miranda shows us Hamilton’s despair. Brilliant.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, the choice of “unimaginable” is no accident. Because the death of a child is, actually, quite imaginable. Young people died before their parents all the time in those days. Alexander knew Philip was going to a duel. But Hamilton, who often imagined his own death, who had seen his friends pass on the battlefield, who was obsessed with imagining every possible scenario and outcome so he could control his future (“Hurricane”), never imagined losing his son, of all things.
&gt; 
&gt; This song will break your heart with its callbacks to “Dear Theodosia,” “That Would Be Enough” and the moment when Alexander’s voice breaks as he begs Eliza to let him stay with her. They move uptown and he finally puts her first.

945,"One thing I love so much about *Hamilton* is that the antagonists aren't some irredeemable villain stereotype. Of course, it helped that they're real people, but Lin took a lot of care to paint Hamilton's enemies in shades of grey, not black. He made sure we sympathized with Burr, that we saw him as a human being with his own loves, fears, and dreams just as much as Hamilton. And Jefferson very clearly loved his country and was trying to do his best for it. 

No person living their life wants to think of themselves as the villain. From their perspective, they're the hero. Hamilton clearly has that point of view, but Lin made an effort to also show the audience both Burr and Jefferson's side of the story so that we can see how they might plausibly believe that *they're* the good guys and Hamilton is a threat that they have to stop. As a result they all come across as complex, flawed, heroic human beings, and it's both interesting and tragic to see them pitted against each other--more so than if they'd all been some black and white good guy/bad guy cliche.

&gt; In person, Mr. Diggs displays none of that braggart sensibility he brings to both Jefferson and Lafayette. He’s quiet, with a shy laugh and a tendency to cough politely before answering a question. He claimed his favorite song to perform in the whole show is “Wait For It,” in which he merely sings backup for Leslie Odom Jr.’s show-stopping number. “He sings the hell out of the song, and I just love listening to it every night, and I love being up there,” Mr. Diggs said. “And it’s a moment where all of us—the whole cast—is onstage, creating a dramatic tension for this one man’s song. And when it works, it’s kind of the most beautiful thing.”

&gt; Asked how he was able to find an “in” to such an alpha character, Mr. Diggs discussed his process. “I think by trying to figure out how we can make him an appropriate foil to Hamilton, when Hamilton always wins in our show and he’s always a couple steps ahead, and he throws Jefferson off his game. But there has to be some tension there, so we decided that Jefferson wins via charisma.

954,"Cool! 

Did you know that crocodiles and some turtles and tortoises (as well as a few other organisms) have something called *negligible senescence*? That means they don't age like most organisms (including humans) do. No matter how healthy a human being is, our bodies deteriorate with age and at a certain point we lose some functions (producing pigments for hair, ability to reproduce, etc.) until we die. Not so for turtles, tortoises and crocodiles (and some others). They suffer no ill effects from advanced age, and a 300-year-old tortoise is just as healthy as a 3-year-old one. ([Remember that 100-year-old tortoise that saved his species by sexing up every female in sight and fathering 800 babies?](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/16/galapagos-tortoise-fathers-800-save-species-newser/90475418/)) Give these creatures enough food and optimal living conditions and prevent them from becoming ill, injured, or eaten, and they can effectively live for centuries, or until some far-off expiration date that humans have been too short-lived to figure out yet. Also, they don't stop growing! That's how we get those terrifyingly enormous crocodiles like [this one](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q6yXTP-5eeA/maxresdefault.jpg). The biggest (heh) problem these guys have (barring humans) is finding enough food to sustain their size, and if they can't, they starve, and that's what gets them eventually. Awesome, huh?

storage place in the cellar or during surgical exercises, he was refused a diploma. Eventually, however, because of the dire lack of medical personnel, he was placed in
charge of 300 wounded Prussian prisoners (some accounts say 400) who had been
stricken with typhus. When Napoleon fell in 1814, the soldiers requested that their
eighteen-year-old aide du camp, who by now spoke German and whom they found both
entertaining and extremely solicitous of their well being, be put in charge of their
repatriation to Berlin. Upon their safe arrival, following several attacks by outposts of
French soldiers who were pacified through the diplomacy of Vattemare, the Prussian
authorities recognized his service by awarding him the ‘Croix de fer’.

&gt; Around the age of seven he discovered that he could make his voice speak as though it were issuing from outside of his body, at a great distance or up close, and that he had an uncanny ability to imitate
&gt; all manner of sounds: human, animal, and mechanical. He could become a barking
&gt; dog, a querulous old man, a silly young girl, a banging door or the whine of a saw.
&gt; One can only speculate about the psychological origins of this gift that allowed him to
&gt; change character at will, first tried out on his family and on the villagers of Lisieux, the
&gt; town to which his father had retired during the revolutionary years to practice law.
&gt; Later in life he would describe many of his most successful tricks, some of which can be
&gt; seen as the expression of a repressed self creating farcical situations for its own release:
&gt; cries of a drowning man being swept away by the current that brought crowds of
&gt; Lisieux’s inhabitants with barges to drag the bottom of the river; cries of a voice in the
&gt; chimney and cupboards and haystacks of neighbouring farms that the superstitious
&gt; rustics believed to be the Devil or souls trapped in Purgatory; cries of a dead relative
&gt; out of the embers of a fire that inspired the local curate to sprinkle the hearth with
&gt; holy water. 

Also apparently he trolled his father a lot:

&gt; He was in the habit of occasionally deceiving his father, by imitating the
&gt; voice of a letter carrier, who usually called every post day: often, when the
&gt; old gentleman expected correspondence of consequence from Paris, was he
&gt; suddenly summoned by the well-known and welcome voice of the man of
&gt; letters, and greatly was he chagrined, surprised, and enraged at the

1080,"Hi! I know I'm late to this thread so I'm hoping you still see this. I've always had this question about reality shows and you may know the answer.

In contest type shows, Master Chef for example, we get footage of the cooks in action, then it occasionally cuts to the person sitting in front of a camera talking about how they're feeling in the moment. Like, somebody's baking a cake, then it cuts to them bragging about how they're so sure they're gonna win the challenge because their cake looks great or whatever. But then the judges actually taste it and it's awful. My question is, when are those sit-down confessionals filmed? Because if they're filmed after the contest, why wouldn't the cooks take into account the results of the challenge when they're telling the story? Like, maybe if they know they're gonna mess up in the end, why not lessen the bragging so that it's not so embarrassing when they fail? But they all tell their story as if they have no idea what's gonna happen next, and since they're not actors, I wonder how producers get them to sink back into that ""in the moment"" mindset so that their interviews seem spontaneous and immediate.

I'd be so happy if you could tell me anything about this aspect of your work. Thanks so much!",2016-09-12 14:14:45+00:00,d7jjvz2,4.0,t1_d7cozbs,439022.0,realitytv

&gt; A developing queen bee is fed royal jelly exclusively—not pollen and honey like her proletarian sisters. Some describe withholding royal jelly from worker bees as nutritional castration. These bees don’t get the special Food of the Gods. Or, perhaps, food of genetic monarchies. And so, we thought, their ovaries shrivel, and they don’t become a queen.

&gt; It turns out, it’s the other way around. Not feeding an immature queen pollen and honey is what makes her royal, not her exclusive access to royal jelly.

&gt; We’ve known for a while that bees’ diet is involved in building different kinds of bee bodies. Science is still figuring out just how that happens. Queen larvae are surrounded by royal jelly; they float on a sea of sugary bee gland snot in enlarged cells. Worker bees eat beebread (a type of fermented pollen) and honey. Nurse bees mash this into a “worker jelly” and add glandular secretions as a garnish. Workers don’t get the special stuff in queen jelly, and their ovaries shrivel.

&gt; Beebread and honey are derived from plant materials, and like many plant materials, they contain a variety of phenolic chemicals. We eat them all the time; flavonoids are the plant chemicals that give plants their unique flavors (and help plants discourage plant-eating insects, among other functions).

&gt; Royal jelly, however, has no detectable phenolic acids. None. From previous research, the researchers knew that flavonoids increase immune responses of adult worker bees. That’s a good thing; it has the side effect of helping bees detoxify pesticides faster. The scientists wondered how developing bees would react to phenolic compounds.

&gt; To find out, they fed two groups of bee larvae diets with and without p-coumaric acid, a common type of flavonoid. Then they looked closely at differences in gene activation between the groups. The results were startling, unexpected, and nifty.

&gt; Bees reared on the p-coumaric acid diet had ovaries significantly smaller than those reared without that compound. That’s the kicker, because what makes a queen bee a queen? She’s the only bee in the hive laying eggs. Fourteen genes known to be involved in worker-queen differentiation were upregulated, or increased in expression.",2016-09-12 05:31:26+00:00,d7j8fuk,1.0,t3_52ct5l,482.0,todayilearned

I don't know that you can say that. In the train test, the trainees were tested about their loyalty to their sponsor specifically and Kingsman generally (Eggsy wasn't asked to give up Arthur, but Harry Hart). In the dog test, Roxy was handled by someone else (you can hear her take the shot in another room), so it's definitely not obedience to Arthur that they're evaluating. It's more logical that they're being trained to be loyal to Kingsman and its ideals and not just whoever is in Arthur's seat.

The rest of it may or not be true, but the point is, *Valentine* doesn't know that. He has no reason for complacency. He doesn't strike me as a particularly trusting person that would just believe Arthur if he said pinky promise my agents won't get in your way.

1145,"There's a great fanfiction site, [Archive of Our Own](http://archiveofourown.org/), with an amazing sorting, filtering, and tagging system. You can see just from reading the tags exactly what you're getting so that there are no nasty surprises, from kinks to character deaths. Sometimes authors will mark that they've refused to use archive warnings in their works, so you can choose not to risk those or just be wary when you're reading. You can also exclude some search terms to avoid anything you hate (put ""-bloodplay"" in the ""Search within results"" text box). Honestly if you master the sort and filter function and read the tags you're golden. Sort by the number of kudos or comments to find the top rated fics if you're just starting out.

1213,"The novelization apparently reveals what exactly woke R2 and it doesn't exactly contradict this fan theory. Here's how that part of the novel is summarized in [this article](http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/star-wars-force-awakens-novelization-highlights/) (because I didn't read it myself):

&gt; #BB-8's map triggers R2-D2's awakening

&gt; One of the more confusing aspects of The Force Awakens is what prompts R2-D2 to awaken from his self-imposed electronic exile. As far as we know, droids can't be Force-sensitive, so it's not like R2 sensed Rey's presence and realized that it was time to guide her to Luke. What, then, woke R2 up?

&gt; According to the novelization, R2 overhears Resistance leaders discussing the map to Luke—which is really a map to the first Jedi temple—including Rey saying that the First Order ""extracted it from the Imperial archives."" Because R2, according to Abrams, ""downloaded the archives of the Empire"" onboard the Death Star, he had the map files that Kylo mentioned to Rey while interrogating her.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As this strategy session plays out in the novelization, ""no one noticed that a light had come on atop a small R2 unit shoved back among the rest of the equipment in the room.""
&gt; 
&gt; In the movie, the first mention of the Empire's files near R2 comes much earlier. Abrams says that it ""triggers something that would ultimately wake him up,"" meaning that, unlike in the novelization, the wake-up process in the movie is slower. But at least both Abrams and the novelization agree that the mention of Imperial records is the key moment.",2016-09-02 16:33:10+00:00,d76xhvy,1.0,t3_50t11y,13665.0,tumblr

And I am. I've helped more than one girlfriend plan surprises, helped my friend understand the woman's perspective during any fights, and never crossed any boundaries that might cause trouble for them. None of his girlfriends have ever had a problem with me, and I've stayed friends with two of them after they broke up (he's a good guy so his breakups are mostly amicable). I see posts like this where girlfriends have a justifiable problem with their boyfriend's female BFF, and it irks me. If you're really a true friend, wouldn't you want your friend to be happy?

1367,"&gt; she, being a conventionally-attractive girl, normally would have been of high status on her own

Except Olive doesn't have this high status. Yes, *she looks like Emma Stone*, but the narration at the start is all about how she's invisible, you know, the usual Hollywood shtick where we're supposed to suspend our disbelief that this genetically perfect human somehow gets ignored by other teenagers. Then she gives herself a sexpot makeover and pretends to sleep with loser guys, which elevates their status but lowers hers. How is that not the double standard? A girl and a boy are assumed to engage in the exact same act, and they are judged differently for it. And it's not about social status, because the proposed gender-flipped situation doesn't ring true.

In *A Walk to Remember*, Landon the popular guy kisses Jamie the outcast, and this disturbance of the social hierarchy causes *Jamie* to get bullied.  It's the girl who suffers for daring to reach above her station, as it were, while the guy would have faced no consequences until he decided to turn on his friends himself. Same situation in *The Cinderella Story*. Also, more recently, *The D.U.F.F*. I'm sure there are more, but they all tend to blend together in my head. It's the same double standard in action. So if a male Olive counterpart starts sleeping with loser girls, I'm sure it would just slide off his back while the girls would suffer the brunt of the social pressure to back off.",2016-08-26 15:00:41+00:00,d6xkah8,4.0,t1_d6xi2ne,3032.0,TrollXChromosomes

It’s the third-biggest live-action opening of the summer behind X-Men: Apocalypse and Captain America: Civil War.

Also:

&gt; they are reduced to the same stereotypes and cheap jokes that we were trying to avoid.

From where I'm standing, I saw no unreasonably skimpy costumes or sky-high heels, no tits-and-ass shots, no fat jokes, no bitchy catfighting, no lesbian stereotypes (the lesbian in the movie isn't angry or man-hating or slutty), no one was given a magical makeover into a femme fatale, no shoehorned romance, no women stuffed in the fridge, no one had to seduce any guys for the plan to work. The movie passes the Bechdel test spectacularly, and while I would've loved it if the black character was one of the academics, that only shows that we should make more movies like this until we get it right rather than never making them again. 

And, by the way, your first comment?

&gt; It won't work because it just doesn't work. There was never any sense in gender swapping Ghostbusters.

What's unrealistic or nonsensical about women, those women, being badass at the same job that the original team of men was able to do? It makes perfect sense.

&gt; There's no sense in gender swapping anything. Create something new.

&gt; If you think an erection lasting more than 4 hours is a problem, try one lasting more than 99 million years.
&gt; 
&gt; That's how long the penis of a newly discovered arachnid fossil has been standing at attention. The harvestman, a spider relative also known as a daddy longlegs, was encased in amber during the Cretaceous in what is now Myanmar. Its distinctive penis, with a heart-shaped tip and a bit of a twist at the end, was erect at the time.
&gt;

So I did, and we all began taking the exam scheduled for that day. My dad's reply came in halfway through the test, and I wanted to call Prof. Tan's attention. Only my brain was still floating in exam-space and the last thing I read was my father's name on my phone screen, so instead of raising my hand and calling out, ""Professor Tan?""

(I constantly have to remind myself that it's unfair to compare her to Tolkien, and even Tolkien had moments where he wrestled with some aspect of his worldbuilding and eventually settled on ""fuck if I know"" for an answer.)

1741,"First of all, congrats on getting into grad school! That's a wonderful achievement, and it's a testament to your talent and determination. Good job.

Second, this might be a stupid suggestion, but check your privacy settings. I once read about a prank where this guy got into somebody's facebook and changed all the settings so that nobody could see their posts, and watched them wonder why they were suddenly being completely ignored. So just check.

Third, take a couple of hours to unplug from social media and do whatever self-care habits you've found to be most efective. Drink some tea, take a nap, or watch a fun movie--whatever works. When you've got a bit of equilibrium back, call up a friend and give the happy news that way. You can gauge the sincerity of the reaction better that way. If they're genuinely excited, then maybe after the well-wishing you can share a bit about how you're feeling and hopefully get some reassurance, and maybe plan a celebration. If they're jealous or dismissive, then you know that the friendship isn't as real as it should be, and you can stop wasting your time.

Listen, I've played the role of the ""endless giver"" before, somehow always ending up in the supportive role without being supported in return, and I know it hurts to feel ignored and taken for granted. The most toxic thing you can do is to suffer in silence. If you speak up, you can either get your needs met or, if they're not willing to do that, turn your attention towards finding more balanced friendships. Which, I promise you, are out there. You're going into grad school! That's exciting. You're just finding out now how many people deserve to be part of that upcoming chapter in your life.

1885,"No (also, calm down). The first comment was this:

&gt; He was making sure nothing happened during the journey where they had the opportunity to kill or take Harry and use his hair to plant a fake Harry to spy on them.

I assume by ""use his hair"" he meant use Polyjuice Potion. And we know how Polyjuice Potion works, it isn't a split-second transformation, and it doesn't copy the clothes of the original. It would take more time than Voldemort had to pull off replacing Harry Potter with an impostor *on the air* right under Hagrid's nose.

None of the examples you mentioned are really relevant. You can do any crazy thing you want in a universe, as long as you follow its internal logic. And J.K. Rowling already set out the rules for Polyjuice Potion. She can't suddenly say that *just this time*, Voldemort can use it instantaneously and on the fly.

So I was saying it doesn't make sense for Lupin to think that Harry was replaced *during the ambush*. There was simply no time and no opportunity. Time and opportunity, however, were both present when Harry was alone at Privet Drive before the Order arrived. So he could have been replaced *then*. Which brings me back to the question: are we to assume that Polyjuice Potion will still work with hair taken from a fake body?",2016-08-16 01:54:42+00:00,d6j5f84,6.0,t1_d6j0un9,6859.0,harrypotter

Second, I think you're right. There's a reason why there's such a strong sense of nostalgia for the nineties, and that's because people shared so many common experiences back then. Even if you resisted a certain trend, you can't help but be aware of it because it's constantly in your face for a sustained length of time. These days, even if your thumb is constantly on the pulse of pop culture, there's still too much happening to keep up. There's a reason why mainstream media reporting on internet trends feels so cringey--it's because by the time they're aware of it, it's already old news. We're no longer all doing just one thing together the way we all did the macarena, all over the world.

Marriage won't change that part of that personality, so if you really want to be happy with this man, take this chance to address the bigger picture of his relationships with other women instead of just focusing on your wedding plans.

Look, I have a lot of guy friends, so I'll be the first to refute the belief that opposite-sex friendships are inherently problematic. But I do know that these friendships can and SHOULD be conducted with the principle that each other's SO's should always take top priority, even if the friendship has been going on for far longer than the relationship. I'd be the first person to smack my buddy upside the head if I ever learn that our closeness is making his SO feel uncomfortable and he's doing nothing about it. And verbal reassurances are not enough, because words are cheap. His actions should make it clear that the woman he loves and wants to share a life with comes first for him, always.

&gt;I don't want him to give up his friends, but when he compliments, praises, gives gifts to, and says the same things to these girls that he says to me, I honestly don't feel like we share any special emotional intimacy. I feel like the only thing that distinguishes me as the fiancee is the fact that we have sex.

This? This is not okay. He is giving pieces of his heart to others that should exclusively belong to you. And I know it sucks, but in a way it's a good thing that you're being forced to confront this problem BEFORE the wedding. If your fiance is being willfully oblivious of the hurt and insecurities his ""friendships"" are causing you now, then a signed contract will only make him feel like he can get away with worse.",2016-08-11 03:11:14+00:00,d6crl5f,1.0,t3_4x5bhv,9990.0,relationships

1978,"Okay, so SPOILER ALERT to anyone else who's reading.

.

.

.

A Jesuit priest who's also an astrophysicist travels with a space exploration team to the Phoenix Nebula, which is the remains of an exploded star three thousand light years away from Earth. When they get there, among the clouds of gas, they discover that one planet from the dead star's solar system remains more or less intact, probably because it was the farthest away from the blast.

When they land on the planet, they find that just beneath the surface there's buried a huge repository of records about a civilization that got obliterated when the star exploded. These people lived on a planet close to their dying sun, and they had mastered just enough of space travel to get to other planets within their own solar system, but were not yet able to get to a different system to save themselves from the oncoming death of their sun. So, knowing that their apocalypse was coming, basically, they hauled meticulous records of their civilization and took them to an underground vault in the farthest planet they could get to, the one least likely to be vaporized. They knew that extinction was imminent, so they spent the last remaining time of their existence making sure that they left *something* behind, hoping that someday, other beings might come along and discover that they once existed there. It was a desperate attempt at a cosmic ""we were here"" grafitti, if you will.

So now there are all these astronauts from Earth, sorting through what the dead civilization left behind, and they realize how very much like us those people were. Their histories, their culture, their lives, were no less complex and valuable than ours. So now the team's totally depressed, coming to terms with how this beautiful world full of beings who lived and loved and made music and art was just...destroyed. Every single one of them, just like that.

As for the priest, he's having a worse struggle than any of them. See, he calculated the time the star went supernova, the distance of that star from the Earth, how long it would take for the explosion's blaze of light to reach the Earth, and he realized the significance of it all. On Earth, the death of this star would've shown in the night sky around the time that Jesus was born. Its brilliance in the east had been the Star of Bethlehem. So he's having a crisis of faith, understandably. All his life he's believed in a merciful God. And yet:

&gt; Oh God, there were so many stars you could have used. What was the need to give these people to the fire, that the symbol of their passing might shine above Bethlehem?

2107,"The Mesopotamian folk tale **""The Appointment in Samarra""** seems to be a mind-fuck for many students that I've read it to. Here it is in a retelling by Roger Hurn:

****

&gt; Once, many, many years ago, when the world was a very different place, a rich merchant lived in the city of Baghdad. One day, the merchant decided to hold a feast for his friends so he sent for his most trusted servant.
&gt; 
&gt; “Ahmed,” he said. “I want you to go to the market place and search for food and drink that will astound and delight my guests when they come to dine with me tonight. Buy only the finest produce. My friends will expect nothing less than the best.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Don”t worry, master,” said Ahmed. “You can rely on me not to let you down.”
&gt; 
&gt; Ahmed bowed and hurried off but he wasn’t looking forward to his task. The day was hot and he knew the market place would be filled with bustling crowds. He was right. People were pushing and shoving each other to get at the best bargains. Ahmed sighed and plunged into the seething mass of humanity.
&gt; 
&gt; Suddenly, he felt a hand tug at his sleeve. Ahmed frowned and turned to see who it was. To his horror, a face he had hoped never to see stared at him. Ahmed gasped in fear and took to his heels.
&gt; 
&gt; He raced back to his master’s house and burst into the room where the merchant was counting his money. The merchant looked up in surprise. “You’re back soon,” he said. “I expected you to be hours yet. I hope you haven’t just bought the first things you saw.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I haven’t bought anything,” replied Ahmed.
&gt; 
&gt; The merchant frowned. “Why ever not?” he asked angrily. “You had better have a good reason for disobeying me.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I do,” said Ahmed in a very shaky voice.
&gt; 
&gt; “Well, tell me what it is,” said the merchant. “And be quick about it.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I went to the market place as you ordered,” said Ahmed. “But when I was there someone grabbed hold of my sleeve and pulled on it.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Well, that was a bit rude of them I suppose,” said the merchant. “But surely it was no reason for you to come running home.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh yes it was,” replied Ahmed, “because the creature that grabbed me was Death herself!”
&gt; 
&gt; “No!” gasped the merchant.
&gt; 
&gt; “Yes!” said Ahmed. “And Death glared at me in a most horrible way. I was terrified!”
&gt; 
&gt; “Of course you were,” said the merchant, “you poor man.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I didn’t know what to do, so I ran away.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Quite right too,” agreed his master.
&gt; 
&gt; “Look,” said Ahmed, “I can’t stay here now. Please lend me a horse and I’ll ride to Samarra and hide at my friend’s house. It’s the perfect solution. Death will never find me there.”
&gt; 
&gt; “That’s a good idea,” said the merchant. “Take the horse and go immediately. You’ll be safe in Samarra, it’s miles from Baghdad.”
&gt; 
&gt; Ahmed saddled up the merchant’s swiftest horse and galloped off to Samarra without further delay.
&gt; 
&gt; After he was gone, the merchant decided to go to the market place. He was angry with Death. “Ahmed was my best and most trusted servant,” he said to himself, “Death had no right to scare him.”
&gt; 
&gt; The merchant strode into the market and sure enough he soon spotted Death standing by herself in a shadowy corner.
&gt; 
&gt; He marched up to the creature and said in a very firm voice, “Hey, I want a word with you.”
&gt; 
&gt; Death turned to the merchant and said in a voice as cold as the north wind in winter, “What do you want with me, mortal?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Well,” said the merchant, “I want to know why you frightened my servant this morning. You had no right to glare at him.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I didn’t glare at him,” replied Death, “the look I gave him was one of surprise.”
&gt; 
&gt; The merchant was puzzled. “Why were you surprised to see my servant Ahmed?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Because,” replied Death, “I didn’t expect to see him here in Baghdad. You see I have an appointment with him tonight at his friend’s house in Samarra!”

2108,"This story contains a passage that's so deeply embedded in my brain that I will never be able to forget it, and it just captures perfectly for me why I like some stories (books, movies, shows, etc.) and hate or get bored by others:

&gt; “The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual,
&gt; only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain. If you can't lick 'em, join 'em. If it hurts, repeat it. But to praise despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to lose hold of everything else. We have almost lost hold. We can no longer describe a happy man, nor make any celebration of joy.” ",2016-08-06 15:21:19+00:00,d66q562,2.0,t1_d66plhf,1023.0,AskReddit

From [this article](http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/16/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-episode-2):

&gt; When Millie auditioned, she had long brown hair down past her shoulders. But Eleven was written as having hair “buzzed almost to the scalp.” Millie and her parents were understandably hesitant to chop it all off. Would it look ugly? Would it cost her other roles? Fortunately, Mad Max: Fury Road was about to come out, so we pulled out a magazine photograph of Charlize Theron as Furiosa and showed it to Millie. “Charlize looks totally badass, right?” Millie agreed; Charlize looked badass. And that was it: She agreed to buzz it all off.
&gt; 
&gt; When the day of the haircut finally arrived, Millie’s mom brought out a camcorder, while her dad ran away with tears in his eyes, unable to watch. It was a pretty dramatic scene. But also very quick. Within 10 minutes we had shaved it all off and slapped a fake “11” tattoo on Millie’s wrist. Millie looked at herself in the mirror, gave her best Furiosa scream — and Eleven was born.",2016-08-04 02:34:58+00:00,d63eil0,3.0,t1_d63bdq5,4747.0,tumblr

You've gone on and on here about how selfless and wonderful she is. This is such a relatively small thing to do to prove that you deserve her.

Speaking of gripes with fans, my problem is when someone brings up a criticism of  poor decision a character makes or a stupid, overused plot cliche, and some fans would be like ""but it makes sense for the character/the story!"" Like, you get that this is fiction, right? That didn't happen organically. A group of people sat in a room and decided to write a scene where a woman is killed to give the hero motivation for the eleventy billionth time, to give a common example. That didn't *have* to happen; it wasn't inevitable in the plot--the writers made that decision, and it's fair to call them out for it.

2374,"&gt; they need to accelerate a bit to fit everything into the season

This can be done without making things *feel* rushed, though! Like, idk if you watch *Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D*., and it's not a perfect show, but one of the things I like the most about it is that when bad things happen, it *matters*. Cases in point:

**[ SP O I L E R S A H O Y ]**

* When Fitz gets brain damaged due to hypoxia, they actually show him struggling with his new limitations not only mentally but also emotionally. Sure, we get to see a bit of Hollywood magic in that he seems to recover later on, but that's plausible at least, and he *earned* his way there

* Bobbi Morse gets kidnapped and tortured by Ward, and it actually takes her a considerable amount of time and effort to recover, and the psychological change that it causes in her is also addressed

* Everyone deals with Ward's betrayal in their own ways

* Jemma's struggle at getting back to normal life after being stranded on Maveth

* Coulson violates his own moral code and he doesn't get off scot-free. It comes back to haunt him, literally

* Poor ~~Skye~~ Daisy :'(

These are just a few examples, but they really allow me to get invested in this show. When the characters are in danger, I feel tense, because I know that if something bad happens, they're really gonna suffer the repercussions of it. And, you know, I still watch dumb, lighthearted stuff like *Hawaii 50* where they're pretty spotty about depicting believable consequences, but I have to dial down my logic even more to enjoy it because *AoS* has shown me what's possible.

2385,"I don't really watch iZombie, but my problem is when the lie or the omission shapes the life and the relationships of the character that's left in the dark, while the character who knows the truth just lets them flounder about in ignorance for ~drama.

Like in *Ant Man* **[ S P O I L E R     A L E R T  S P O I L E R     A L E R T  S P O I L E R     A L E R T ]** where Hank Pym lies to his daughter about his wife's death for *years*. She's smart and she knows he's keeping the truth from her and their relationship has suffered greatly for it, so why didn't he just tell her sooner? The safety of the world hangs in the balance, yet he would prefer to depend on a complete and total noob rather than let his adult, competent, badass daughter decide for herself what danger she can and cannot handle. I get it, he was afraid of losing her like he lost his wife, but you can be a parent and have those fears and still respect your child as an adult who can make up their own mind as long as they have all the information. It's in character for Hank Pym as an asshole, but every narrative cue in that movie wanted the audience to forgive and indulge him.

There are countless other examples of problems caused by poor communication skills and lack of transparency (*Star Wars* and *Harry Potter*, anyone?), and I mostly think it's lazy writing because come on, can't they think up a couple of more interesting conflicts that can't be solved by a five-minute honest conversation?

***
(**EDIT:** Just wanted to add a Marvel show that actually did this trope really well: *Daredevil*.

Again, **S P O I L E R S.**

Like Hank Pym, Matt Murdock spent years lying and keeping vital information from the most important person in his life. Unlike in *Ant Man*, however, this is treated with the gravity it deserves. *Daredevil* spends an entire episode on the confrontation between Matt and Foggy, and the fallout of that deception is felt in their relationship for the rest of the season and into the next. The repercussions don't just get hand-waved away because the character who lied happens to be the hero. Also, the narrative completely justifies Foggy for his reaction--he isn't portrayed as unreasonable for being hurt that Matt lied to him for so long about things that directly affect Foggy, no matter how compelling Matt's reasons are. I think it was really well done, and they both felt like real people having believable and very human reactions to the events. Of course, the Netflix format allows the show to give this kind of character building more attention, but the point is that it can be done.)",2016-07-23 20:10:36+00:00,d5nyhj2,3.0,t1_d5nwikr,3342.0,tumblr

2442,"Lmao, yeah, kinda like that. Last Friday night I went out with a bunch of friends, and one of them turned up with a coworker in tow. They were both in suits, because apparently they came straight from a work event. Everyone went straight to giving our friend shit for his (highly uncharacteristic) formal attire, just good-natured teasing, and the new guy was just kind of awkwardly sitting there. So I looked at him and said something like, ""Hey, are those purple arrows on your tie? That's so cute!"" and he just sorta stammered at me in response. I guess our friends realized then that they were being rude, so they turned to New Guy and started talking to him to make him feel welcome. I thought that was that.

Except since then he's been messaging me nonstop and pestering my friend to get my number, even after I politely turned him down the first time he asked me out.

He was referring, of course to Men and Elves, and contemplating the weight that the concepts of death and immortality have laid upon them. So yeah, I don't think that when Tolkien talks about death he's expressing some sort of nihilistic or depressive sentiment--he was just being philosophical.

This is not to say, of course, that he does or doesn't have PTSD or depression. I don't really know.

I don't know if OP's boyfriend has become a better person since then, or if the relationship can be saved.

2472,"I don't know about PTSD, and I don't have any context for that quote, but I do know that in Tolkien's works, death isn't necessarily a grim and hopeless thing. In the Silmarillion, he makes a very specific distinction between the fates of Elves and Men:

Elves, when they die due to some physical or spiritual wound, spend some time resting and recuperating (in spirit) in the Halls of Mandos (on the northern shores of Valinor). In due time they are reincarnated and live again amongst their kin, or they can choose to stay in the Halls until the world ends. 

For Men, on the other hand, death is final. When they die, after however long they've lived, their spirits also go to the Halls of Mandos for a time of waiting, and then they leave the bounds of the world entirely for some mysterious fate. In Tolkien's mythology, this is supposed to be a *gift*, given by Eru the Creator. The Elves are tied to the world for however long it lasts, but Men get to discover something *beyond*. Unfortunately, Morgoth corrupted Men to think of the Gift as a Doom, something terrible instead of a blessing, which is how a whole lot of trouble began. However there remained a few who understood death's true meaning and didn't fear it, surrendering themselves willingly to what comes next after the end of their mortal lives (see: Aragorn, for example). 

This is not to say that Tolkien dismissed grief as a natural reaction to death and loss, of course not. I'm just saying, without knowing the rest of what he said in that interview, that it's possible that that quote may not be as grim and depressing as it sounds, if you consider his philosophy both as a writer and a Catholic.",2016-07-17 16:40:58+00:00,d5fr5v0,1.0,t3_4t9qn3,9550.0,tolkienfans

Although, full disclosure: my attention during the movie was split between watching it and enjoying my friend's snarky remarks, so some of my thoughts about it may be conflated with ideas from the book that were not in the onscreen adaptation. So, here goes:

***

**THE 50 SHADES OF FUCKED UP STORY:**

Christian still has the same background, a victim of abuse turned abuser. Anna is still the same sweet, soft-spoken, *innocent* girl she was introduced as--in other words, perfect bait for a predator. To Christian, Anna is a blank slate that he can mold to his desires. To Anna, Christian is an urbane, rich, magnetic billionaire that sweeps her off her feet and leads her into an intense sexual awakening beyond anything she's ever dreamed of. 

Let the story start fairy tale perfect, with Anna brushing off warnings from her friends and family about how fast everything is progressing. Then, because Anna is a smart girl (supposedly, lol), she starts to notice the cracks in Christian's facade, the control, the manipulation. But by then she's addicted, she's in love, and she rationalizes Christian's obsession with possessing her as true love. IRL, there are many smart, capable, *experienced* women who fall in love with abusers, so it's hardly implausible for this to happen. But the important thing is for the narrative to throw every cue at the audience that Anna is in danger, that she has to get out, out, *out*. Let the audience fear for her instead of fantasize of being in her place. Show the conflict in Anna as she struggles with her love for Christian, her instinct that this is *wrong*, and her hope that maybe if she loves him enough, if she gives more of herself, then she can fix him somehow. Show the cycle of abuse that every victim knows, from the hurting to the apologizing to the love bombing to the calm and back to the hurting and so on. Show Anna trying to escape the cycle but falling back into it over and over again. Show that Christian does, on some level, maybe try to ""be better"" for Anna, except mental health doesn't work that way, because people have to change for themselves, and it will take actual years. If we want to end the movie with hope for Christian's redemption, maybe he realizes how severely fucked up he is and lets Anna go himself. And then therapy for everyone, and an ambiguous but hopeful ending.


**THE HAPPILY EVER AFTER VERSION:**

Christian still has his history of abuse, only in this world he's been in therapy for years. He's even accepted his sexuality and his desire to dominate and is an active member of a healthy BDSM community. He practices his kinks safely and consensually, and he's made peace with that part of himself, despite his past trauma. But he's never been in love, preferring to keep his sexual encounters friendly but casual.

Enter Anna. She's smart, spunky, and self-assured--and she may be a virgin but she has a latent submissive streak a mile wide. She's drawn to Christian and his dominance, and he in turn is drawn to her, and is terrified of it. Because although Christian does fine with his casual partners, now he's emotionally invested, and he's scared shitless that his past trauma might trip him up and cause him to mess Anna up somehow. So he angsts it out with a trusted friend in the BDSM club, talks to his therapist, and they tell him to just take it slow and communicate *a lot*. Anna, meanwhile, because she has a brain, researches the fuck out of this brave new world and learns that being submissive doesn't mean being powerless (the opposite in fact), and just because you submit to someone in the bedroom doesn't mean you can't have a relationship of equals. So the two of them talk it out like fully functioning adults, and they embark on a long, delicious *slow* burn of  learning to trust each other and themselves, discovering each other's buttons and boundaries, and finding and creating their own balance. And they live happily ever after, with whips and chains and nipple clamps.

If they just *explicitly* acknowledged that this is *not* a healthy relationship, this is *not* a happily-ever-after romance--with the stalking and the lack of respect for boundaries (which actual BDSM people complain about)--then there's a story to be told there. A dark story, but it could be worthwhile.

Alternatively, fix the abusive aspects of the relationship (let Christian actually listen to and respect Anna's boundaries) and then heighten the freakiness of the sex--and you can tell the story of how even the kinkiest sexual acts in the bounds of a loving, healthy relationship can be as romantic as anything fucking Nicholas Sparks can think of.

Also, if she can't even share one day with you, a day that's supposed to be about *both* of you--what does that say about her preparedness for a lifetime of compromising and adjusting to each other's needs?

2624,"Hi Mr. Kay! I know I'm horribly late but I learned about this just now (dammit), so I hope you still read this.

My favorite thing about your books is how you can depict both world-changing events and tiny, intimate, human moments and make both seem profound and real and important. A quiet moment by the fire in a kitchen just before dawn feels as vibrant as armies of thousands meeting on the battlefield.

Another thing I like is how you aren't afraid to paint all the shades of gray a person can have. For example, I don't think I've ever read as horrible an act (committed by a human) as having an entire place and all its history erased from common memory as in *Tigana*. That just seemed like such a deeply cruel violation to me, yet despite all that, I learned to love Brandin when I got to know him. I feel like you must be extraordinarily empathetic to be able to create a character like that--to see his flaws and his cruelty and still tell his side of the story and why he's worth loving.

My question is has to do with the second point: has there ever been a human character in your books that you found emotionally difficult to write because you just plain didn't enjoy seeing through their perspective? Alternatively, is it easier (or even fun) writing a character (not necessarily human, like Maugrim) who is just unrepentantly evil and destructive with no redeeming qualities whatsoever?

Thank you for your time and your stories, Mr. Kay!",2016-07-01 02:09:56+00:00,d4utudp,1.0,t3_4qnz7h,18564.0,books

Even if I failed to save myself, it is important to me to have done something. *Anything*, no matter how feeble. I've made a promise to myself to never again be a passive victim. A situation where I am an unconscious victim and thus have *no choice but to be passive* is an amalgamation of several different nightmares. Nope.

Your analogy is a mess and I'm not dealing with it.

I'm aware that I may have no choice what my ""human wiring"" decides to do in such a trauma. For all I know, I could be fully conscious and still have my brain block out the memories as a form of selective amnesia. That is a truly horrifying (to me) scientific possibility.

Having a past that explains current behavior doesn't *justify* it. It may help you understand why he's become a bully himself, but in no way does this excuse his abuse towards others he considers weaker than himself.

He needs therapy. But that will only be effective if he does it for himself, not just to appease you, and first he must acknowledge that his rage is a problem and want to change.

It's still, STILL, all about what YOU want, and how you can get it no matter who you trample on. ""I can't help myself""--that seems to be your mantra, as if that excuses anything. That's a child's reasoning.

**You want Lily back despite the pain it would cause Jenny.**

**You want Lily back despite the pain it would cause Lily's boyfriend.**

**You want Lily back despite the pain it would cause Lily herself.** Because let's be honest here, you have no clue how to truly love someone. Real, grown-up love requires a measure of selflessness, a willingness to prioritize someone else's well being, and you have no clue how to do that. And Lily deserves someone with the same capacity for deep love as she has. (Btw, you're lying to yourself if you think you'd be satisfied with friendship. If she lets you in even a little bit, you'll soon push for more.)

Right now? You can't be a positive presence in Lily's life, either as a friend or a lover. You can't make her happy. You can't even make Jenny happy, because you're lying to her about your level of commitment. And the sad thing is, despite the hurt you cause others in chasing your own happiness, you will fail in that, as well. Selfishness never leads to happiness, because it's never ever satisfied.

For what it's worth, I don't think you're irredeemable. But you have a lot, a LOT, of growing up to do, because right now you're that kid at the toy aisle who doesn't care what other toys you break as long as you get that one toy you *swear* you want. Then once you have it, you'll get bored with it after a week and start wanting other toys, only to regain interest once someone else picks up the toy you discarded. So yeah, dude, fucking grow up.

2694,"How do you act around her when you're not trying to have sex? Are you affectionate and warm towards her when you're *not* trying to get her into bed? Are you thoughtful; do you still make an effort to make her feel special and secure?

I'M NOT SAYING BE NICE TO HER JUST TO SEDUCE HER. Just maybe check yourself: Nine months in, have you lessened the efforts you put into your relationship? That's pretty normal, by the way, most people relax once the courtship stage comes to an end because no one can sustain that heightened state of emotions for very long. It's also normal that the frequency of intercourse lessens at this point. But my theory is that you've stopped putting in as much effort but you're still expecting the same level of sexual intensity as there was in the beginning, which is unreasonable. Then you get grumpy because you're disappointed, which further drives her away, which makes you even grumpier, and so on....

It's important to remember that sex is not a separate thing from the rest of your relationship. If you're feeling close and connected to each other emotionally, it will be reflected in your sexual intimacy. But it needs to be genuine. So definitely DON'T start treating her nicely while expecting her to put out in return. Just take a good honest look at the health of your relationship, get an attitude adjustment, and learn how to communicate with her about your problems in a way that isn't all about you and your needs and your dick's needs.

&gt; A demisexual is a person who does not experience sexual attraction unless they form a strong emotional connection with someone. It's more commonly seen in but by no means confined to romantic relationships. The term demisexual comes from the orientation being ""halfway between"" sexual and asexual. Nevertheless, this term does not mean that demisexuals have an incomplete or half-sexuality, nor does it mean that sexual attraction without emotional connection is required for a complete sexuality. In general, demisexuals are not sexually attracted to anyone of any gender; however, when a demisexual is emotionally connected to someone else (whether the feelings are romantic love or deep friendship), the demisexual experiences sexual attraction and desire, but only towards the specific partner or partners.

I mean. Five years of inside jokes and secret confidences, without a thought of how she might feel if/when she finds out? Then she finds out through facebook? And when she's hurt by it, she's called a drama queen? It's all Heather's prerogative, of course, but please don't act like Alyssa's insecurities and feelings of exclusion have no basis in reality.

When I told my sister that I was jealous of how close she was to our brother, *she didn't tell my brother*. She helped me become closer to him, started becoming more aware of the times when they were unintentionally excluding me and tried to become more inclusive, and basically set an example for our brother not to take my efforts for granted. It was one of the most touching things she has ever done for me, and it helped cement *our* bond. Also my little brother never found out what an emotional mess his big sister had been over feeling left out, which helped me save face on that front. 

So I think you may have messed up a bit, dude, blowing the whole thing wide open in front of Heather without Alyssa's permission. Maybe if you had given her a bit more time, or talked it through with her, she could have at least sorted out a way to communicate her thoughts better. Alyssa feeling insecure about her place as a sister and Heather feeling angry that her coming out had become so dramatic are really two different issues that should be dealt with separately, but now it's all tangled up.

2821,"&gt; Alyssa's taken this big milestone in Heather's life, and made it all about her and how she thinks everyone should be reacting, Heather included.

This is absolutely one aspect of the problem, but I can't help but feel like this whole thing is just the straw that broke the camel's back, if you pardon the cliche. I bet these feelings and insecurities have been  building up in Alyssa for the past five years *at least*. She had to have noticed how much closer Heather and OP are to each other than to her, had to have struggled with feeling excluded by them, but had no way to pin down the cause or broach the topic. It's unfortunate that this is all coming to a head after a revelation that's such a hot button topic for both Heather and Alyssa, but I can see how it happened. I can also see that Alyssa is *trying*, at least, to be supportive, and without the rest of the drama she probably would've muddled her way through adjusting into being the kind of ally that Heather needs. But feeling rejected is a powerful thing--it can make a person want to just curl up and hide, and that makes it difficult to access mature and logical thinking.",2016-06-12 16:17:07+00:00,d463tnj,2.0,t1_d45ysp6,8673.0,relationships
2822,"I am a big sister, too, and I can relate to Alyssa. I've played a sort of ""mothering"" role towards my younger sister and brother, like making them food, asking about school, giving advice, etc. I know they appreciate it, but as with any long-term relationship where these things are the norm, sometimes these actions get taken for granted. I get that. I'm guilty of doing the same thing to our parents sometimes.

But when I was in my late teens, I was so jealous of my sister and brother's relationship. My sister never ""mothered"" our brother, and they had the typical immature sibling fights over food, chores, etc. But they were also closer to each other, probably because my sister never stood in a position of authority with our brother (I was often made responsible for them both by our parents). I understood the logic behind our dynamics, but it still hurt. I felt excluded and wounded that I put the most effort into caring for them yet I still seemed like the outsider. 

I did confide this to my sister, and we cried on each other and hugged each other, but if she had tried to deny the truth about what I observed in our relationships, it probably would've made things worse. It would've felt patronizing, and denying the reality of how things are is no way to fix them.

I bet Alyssa feels the same way. Heather and /u/fr00gn may mean well with their protestations that they are all equal, but it only comes across as saying meaningless sentiments to placate Alyssa. Just acknowledge the truth of what Alyssa can see with her own two eyes, don't try to deny that her reaction is valid, and work from there.",2016-06-12 15:49:43+00:00,d462oyk,2.0,t1_d45zi2j,5524.0,relationships

2830,"&gt; ""Magic"" isn't something you just ""cast"". It's hard to explain, but it's definitely deeper than that.

From what I understand it, ""magic"" isn't a skill in Middle Earth, it's a state of being. Everything made by the Elves has some sort of enchantment, for example, even the most mundane objects, purely because it was the Elves who made them. They can consciously perform magic, but most of the time it's just an outpouring of *what* they are. But when creatures who were not created magical dabble in them (such as hobbits and men with the rings of power), it (almost?) always ends up harming and twisting them.

I agree with your reasoning that Gandalf has limited license to act. He's like an ambassador from a powerful kingdom who was sent to aid a less advanced country. He has power, but his assigned role limits him in what he's allowed to do with his power.

2839,"""Normal"" families aren't perfect. They're not made up of parents who never make mistakes or kids who never cross the line. When people love each other, and are close to each other, there are so many ways to cause pain, intentionally or not. 

I've hurt and disappointed my parents so many times, and we've struggled through some tough times, but I've also heard the powerful words ""I forgive you"" and ""We won't speak of this again, it's forgiven"" and I knew every time that they meant it. For my part, I'm now an adult (30 F) who is able to see how very human they are and how they also have their failings. I'm the eldest child, and I can see that there were some parts of how they raised me that they later on realized were wrong and changed for my younger siblings. (For example, I was spanked as a punishment, but my little brother never was.) I used to be bitter about these things, but I've had good examples in forgiveness, so I learned to let them go. No matter what my parents did wrong, I never once doubted that I was loved. I never will.

My sister (27) is now one of my best friends. We were very, very different people growing up, but as we grow older we find more common ground. We still sometimes fight like teenagers, though. Old hurts are dredged up, long emotional emails are sent back and forth, and some arguments will never be resolved. But last year, we were having a big fight just as I was about to leave for a trip, and she came to me asking for a hug and said she didn't want me to go without saying that she loved me. We're still complicated, my sister and I, and there are some things in the past and some people that we are very careful not to talk about, but by now I have no doubt that when it comes down to it, we are on each other's side. We've got each other's backs. And we share a language of inside jokes and references that nobody else speaks, so I miss her badly when we don't spend time together.

My brother (18) is very different in temperament, and the age gap means we have a very different relationship with him. He's very shy, very private, and 80% of the time I don't know what's going on in his head. He's a weirdo, an average student, and a hardcore introvert. I am achingly proud of him. I worry about him, and I wish he would open up more, but we've all agreed not to push and to just wait until he comes to us. As an overly-affectionate sister, it's hard sometimes, but the more I respect his boundaries, the more he approaches me to talk, and I cherish that like nothing else. I bookmark /r/nosleep stories and those creepy/paranormal threads in /r/askreddit for him, because he never wants to read them himself, he just wants to listen to me read them out loud. I HATE SCARY STUFF. I am a coward of the highest degree. But my brother likes them, so I wait until it's daytime and start browsing.

That's my family. I've focused more on our differences and conflicts rather than the ridiculousness that goes on in our lives because I wanted to show that yes, ""normal"" families have arguments, and differences, and moments of high drama. But unrelenting chaos is not the norm, and it shouldn't be. They're lying to you, OP.

2846,"That's because most of Iron Man 1 was for all intents and purposes unscripted, and they were all basically making it up as they went along. Jeff Bridges said he just pretended they were making a  $200 million student film, and talks about it more in [this interview](http://www.incontention.com/2009/12/01/interview-jeff-bridges/):

&gt; “They had no script, man,” Bridges exclaims. “They had an outline. We would show up for big scenes every day and we wouldn’t know what we were going to say. We would have to go into our trailer and work on this scene and call up writers on the phone, ‘You got any ideas?’ Meanwhile the crew is tapping their foot on the stage waiting for us to come on.”
&gt; 
&gt; Bridges, director Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. would literally act out sequences during primitive rehearsals, Downey taking on Bridges’s role and vice versa, to find and essentially improvise their way to full scenes, the actor recounts. Bridges says that the entire production was probably saved by the improv prowess of the film’s director and star.
&gt; 
&gt; “You’ve got the suits from Marvel in the trailer with us saying, ‘No, you wouldn’t say that,'” Bridges remembers. “You would think with a $200 million movie you’d have the shit together, but it was just the opposite. And the reason for that is because they get ahead of themselves. They have a release date before the script, ‘Oh, we’ll have the script before that time,’ and they don’t have their shit together.

The Nazis were real. They were a real thing that existed and caused millions of deaths, and their ideology is still very much alive right now. The pain they caused and are still causing is real, with mass graves and museums full of grisly evidence to show for it. Those very real (and at the time current) monstrosities were the reason Captain America exists at all. From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America):

These are common in very, very rural areas or in tribal lands. Some farm owners already have more permanent dwellings closer to town and the bahay kubo is just a temporary shelter for whoever's working the fields.

I've never heard of homelessness in the countryside. Even if you're all alone by some tragic circumstance, someone will take you in or let you build a kubo on their land or take you on as a farmhand. I can't imagine anyone being homeless in the rural communities I've seen. There is a lot of poverty, yes, but people are kind and will share what little they have.

In the cities, the same can-do attitude applies, and the poor will forage about for whatever materials they can use to build a shelter. There won't be building materials literally growing on trees around them, but take a look at any shanty town in Manila, and if it doesn't break your heart, you can almost admire the creative use of random scraps of wood and metal to make homes.

2943,"&gt; you know full well that literal bayanihan that I mean that is no longer a norm was because of the housing implications (ie its no longer common to see moving houses in the philippines even in rural communities)

I'm saying, *again*, that this is still a norm both in the general sense (helping each other) and in the specific (lifting a house together) in some communities. My family is very actively involved in community literacy outreach to indigenous people (I won't say which tribes since it's a huge clue to my specific location) and they don't have plumbing in the mountains, or even electricity apart from one single generator for the entire barangay. And yes, I've seen these people move each other's houses when they move to a new *kaingin* farm (almost every year someone does this), and I've seen them take turns harvesting each other's fields before the rains come so that they can get the grain to dry as soon as possible. When I say rural, I mean *really freaking rural*, and I suspect I have much more exposure to these communities than you do, so just...chill. Okay?

&gt; it's not eastern/western centric, and not at all difficult for even individualistic people to understand

What I said was that bayanihan *illustrated* a community-oriented (when I say community, I don't mean the literal neighborhood, but any group a person belongs to, like a family or a clan or a region) attitude that may be foreign to individualistically oriented people. Not that bayanihan itself is difficult to understand, but that it's my go-to example when talking to Western friends and helping them comprehend how closely Filipinos intertwine their lives around each other. Like, for example, an American friend (Jason) was having trouble understanding our Filipino friend (Rio) who spent most of his salary sending his younger siblings to school and thus had to delay his own plans to start a family. It was just...incomprehensible to Jason that Rio's individual advancement could be sacrificed to that degree for the sake of his family's well-being, but it's an attitude that's easily understandable to most Filipinos. Also, Jason is not unique in how he feels. As a nearby example, go to /r/relationships and see how ""putting yourself first"" is commonly agreed upon as a healthy thing to do by most American commenters. AGAIN, I'm not making a value judgment. I can see how both putting others first and putting oneself first has pros/cons.

Anyway, I had to explain to Jason the Filipino point of view by using *bayanihan* as a talking point PRECISELY because volunteerism and helping each other was something he *could* understand. I started there and went deeper. 

&gt; My argument was that it wouldnt be difficult talking about bayanihan to any westerner at all.

*That is the point.* Literally what I said was that *bayanihan* is a good example to use to explain our psyche, because it's EASY to understand. I have no clue why you're arguing with me.",2016-05-12 20:14:32+00:00,d334wd7,8.0,t1_d333414,2301.0,interestingasfuck

2952,"*Bayanihan* is absolutely still a norm in rural communities in my province. It is not just about moving houses. It's literally a community coming together in united effort (like a clean-up drive). Talk about hasty generalizations.

And I'm not talking about individualism as in ""refusing to help others."" I'm using them in the sociological sense, as in an [individualist vs a collectivist](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20080814/news_lz1e14brooks.html) society. In individualistic cultures, value is placed on independence and personal achievement, and people see themselves as individuals first, and part of a group second. In collectivist cultures, it's the opposite. People identify themselves with the group the belong to, and the utmost value is placed on having harmony within the group. That's the barest bones of what I meant, but perhaps an example would make it clearer: 

Watch two Americans meeting for the first time, and they'll ask each other ""What do you do?"" as one of the first points of interest, because individual achievements can say a lot about a person in that context. Whereas for two Filipinos meeting for the first time, a typical ice breaker would be: ""Did you say your last name was Tayag? Any relation to the Tayags in Pampanga?"" because knowing what group/clan a person belongs to makes us feel like we have an understanding of that person. Or ""Your hometown is in Dumaguete? Hey, I know someone from Dumaguete. Do you know anyone named Serrano there?"" because identifying that intersection of the two strangers' groups will make them feel closer to each other (and also because Filipinos tend to assume that when you live someplace you must know everyone there).

So no, I wasn't making a value judgment or saying Westerners don't care about each other. It's merely an observation that people from different countries have different ways of looking at the world.",2016-05-12 19:03:29+00:00,d331mtu,6.0,t1_d330mif,1323.0,interestingasfuck

If you're asking about traditional Philippine homes, there's actually quite a bit of variety. In the far north (Batanes) where multiple annual typhoons are a fact of life, they have stone houses like [these](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Batanes_Town.jpg).

But the most common by far, in the countryside, are the typical [*bahay kubo*](https://trevorkloeden.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/10-nipa-hut-4629.jpg) with roofs made of woven nipa or coconut fronds or cogon grass, walls made of thin strips of bamboo or woven into a mat called *sawali* or *amakan* (both those things are bamboo, just prepared differently), and floors made of bamboo slats or wooden boards. All of these materials are easily found in the environment, and if you have the know-how, you can build a house without paying for anything. The Philippines doesn't really get cold, but it does get quite hot and humid, so all these materials are also chosen for good ventilation.

There is a certain type of photographer for whom the skill and the challenge lies in capturing the moment, using the camera to crystallize reality into art. For them, post-processing should be merely a tool to enhance what is already there, or else it's kind of ""cheating,"" I guess. Most nature photographers, for example, fall in this category.

Others think that post-processing is now part of the art itself, not just a tool, but another equally important stage in the process. Most modern portrait photographers do this, on varying levels.

There are still others for whom photography is merely the canvas they use to let their photo manipulating skills come out to play--the ones who make no attempt at realism at all and are more concerned with seeing where their imagination takes them. See: surrealistic artists like [this one](http://www.visualnews.com/2013/05/13/mind-bending-photo-manipulations-from-erik-johansen/).

3075,"I actually sort of understand how you feel. I had a boyfriend once who was so, so different from me in background and interests, and when it was just the two of us, those differences were exciting. But it did make socializing rather odd, since our two friend groups had nothing in common with each other. His friends were all big, tough, hard-partying jocks and mine were geeks and academics. The contrast was rather hilarious.

Our friends were good people, so each group did their best to make each of us feel welcome, but it was still awkward. What did we do? We sucked it up. In a relationship, there are some things you normally wouldn't do that you choose to anyway because it will make the other person happy and your life together easier. I didn't go and memorize sports statistics just to have a topic of conversation with his friends, but I made an honest effort to get to know them and even their girlfriends. And he didn't go and read all the works of J.R.R. Tolkien to talk Middle Earth trivia with my friends, but he did this thing where he ""connived"" with them to put together a surprise for me, and that was how they bonded. It made me feel so loved to see all the important people in my life getting along.

(EDIT TO CLARIFY: This doesn't mean we were constantly around our friends. Some of the time I just sent him off to go have fun with them without me cramping their style, and I also didn't invite him to my friends' coffee shop get togethers where the conversation was sure to turn unbearably nerdy for him. But when we did hang out with our friends, there was no half-hearted politeness in our attitudes. We really were open to getting to know the people who were important to each other.)

Because the thing is, your girlfriend is right. Your relationship doesn't exist in a vacuum. If you're going to merge lives then that also means your social circles are going to converge. You're making it harder for the both of you by creating this wall between you and her friends, like you're saying ""I like you enough, but right there is just how far you can go. Don't come any closer."" That's your choice, and that's fine, but your girlfriend is gonna see that as you resisting to merge your life with hers.

Should you tell others? That's entirely up to you. There are many reasons a couple might want to keep a new relationship private, and that's also a valid choice. As long as you've talked about it and are on the same page, there's nothing wrong with wanting to keep your private life private. Just keep checking in with each other, see if you're still both feeling the same way about the secrecy, and if one of you expresses a desire to come out, then that's an important conversation to have.

3077,"It can be difficult to navigate this tangle of relationships, so I definitely empathize with you. But for what it's worth, it seems like your sister does care about you, otherwise it wouldn't have mattered to her that she wasn't able to attend your graduation. Think back to the time before that. Did you have one-on-one conversations with her, or did your calls always involve your mom? If your mom was always involved, that may be the reason why she was always so short with you. Your mom seems to be the very definition of ""give her an inch, she'll take a mile,"" so your sister has to protect every inch of independence she's gained. This must be very painful and frustrating for her, and she wouldn't be doing it unless it's vital to her own mental and emotional health. Obviously it's painful for you, as well, and your feelings are absolutely valid, but when you start setting up your own boundaries with your parents, you might be able to see where she's coming from. There's also the possibility that she's cutting you off because she doesn't want to make you choose sides, or to ruin your relationship with your parents by telling you the depth of her hurts.

It sucks, but I'm glad you're thinking of how to move forward and gaining your own independence. I do hope you seek counseling for that, because it won't be easy. Even if you and your sister make up and become each other's support systems, you are both still too emotionally involved in the situation to see it clearly.

3078,"Your sister cut off your parents from her life for a reason. It's obvious that she and you have very, very different relationships with your parents, and there must have been a lot of hurt on her part to necessitate going low contact or no contact. I don't know if their conflicts were hidden from you or if you were just oblivious, being the favored child, but it seems like you were simply collateral damage in the fallout. You seem very close with your parents, and that will always make it difficult for her to have a good relationship with you. She is trying to set boundaries and you happen to be standing on the side of the people she wants to keep out.

Now I don't know what went down, but there are some clues in your post. The biggest one?

&gt; My mom wants to “make a point” that you don’t need an invitation for these things, that family can just show up.

That doesn't sound at all like a mother who is longing to celebrate her daughter's special day. That sounds like a entitled woman who only wants to get her way and doesn't care how many boundaries she's crossing or disrespecting. If your mom has always been that way, I fully understand why your sister felt she had to protect her boundaries, hence the estrangement. This confirms it:

&gt; Also, my mom has a habit ignoring my sister’s wishes when it comes to these things.

Your instinct is right. This is a terrible idea. Another thing you may not have considered: if you go along with this ambush, you can say goodbye to ever having a relationship with your sister. You will appear to be completely on your mother's side, and she won't be able to trust you. If you still want to repair your bond, your only hope is to be a neutral party, but even then, it will definitely take some time and effort. (For starters, you can refuse to take part in the graduation ambush, warn your sister of your mother's plan, and send a congratulatory email/invitation to coffee/dinner with just the two of you.)",2016-04-02 14:42:11+00:00,d1mzq16,1.0,t3_4d1k0w,3200.0,relationships

MORE IMPORTANTLY: **Do not attempt to collude with your mother over this.** Your first attempt at communication after five years is over her golden child manipulating money out of your nana? Not good. She will learn three things: 

1. That you will do just about whatever it takes to keep your nana from awkwardness or discomfort. That she is your weak spot.

2. That you are the one who's financially comfortable. You are now the new target.

3. That you are willing to cover for your sister's misdeeds for your nana's sake.

I've learned from both experience and observation that you really can't show any kind of weakness in front of these type of people.

That's gonna make it difficult to get to the place of vulnerability that therapy requires.

**Best case scenario:** she's a decent therapist but she's just not a good match for you. 

**Bad case scenario:** she's fucking incompetent and is talking out of her ass. 

**Worst case scenario:** she's actively manipulating you, making everyone in your life a villain so that she's the only one left on your side.

The wrong therapist can be just as damaging as any other kind of unhealthy relationship. I know someone who has been burned by their therapist before and now has extremely negative views towards counseling even though they acknowledge that it can be helpful for others. Choosing the right therapist is extremely crucial.

So yeah, my advice is to find someone else who makes you feel safe and is a better match.",2016-03-21 04:55:50+00:00,d17jlab,1.0,t3_4b9ra9,21116.0,relationships

You seem like you think you're doing her a favor by staying by her side.

Let me get this clear: BIRTH CONTROL IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BOTH PARTNERS. If she has backwards views about it, *so do you*, since you expect women to be solely responsible. That's utterly immature. The two of you were both present when you were having sex--there is literally no reason for you to not be proactive about it. Just because you say girls in your country are vigilant about birth control, *that does not excuse you in any way*. Quit absolving yourself of blame. She didn't steal your sperm and put it in her uterus. You were right there. She was reckless, yes, but oh boy, so were you.

Look, I wouldn't care, since it's not my job to educate anyone about sexual etiquette, but I'm making an effort here since you said you love this girl.

3158,"Dude, is she Catholic? Because let me tell you, the Catholic church here in the Philippines is very, very, very against what they think of as ""artificial methods"" of birth control. More than 80% of Filipinos are Catholic and are deeply influenced by this attitude. Seriously, it has been a STRUGGLE to get reproductive health laws passed because the church has been actively campaigning against it. We've even had Catholic senators make speeches about how harmful birth control is; one even testified about how his wife taking birth control pills once led to her having miscarriages. Apparently birth control is unnatural and sinful and if you don't want kids then you should just abstain or practice the calendar method. I can't impress on you how very widespread this thinking is. There is no sexual health education in schools. Nada.

No matter how ""enlightened"" your girlfriend seemed, it's possible she's been influenced by this, even if only subconsciously. I talk to many educated, professional people who believe the Catholic church's edicts unquestioningly. And if birth control is this HUGE SIN according to the priests, abortion is even more so. It's a taboo topic here and is actually illegal. If a doctor is caught having performed an abortion, they can be imprisoned. For real. These attitudes go deep into the Filipino psyche.

So yeah, it may not necessarily be that she planned this whole thing like some sort of mastermind. I can definitely see this situation being a product of ignorance and religious influence.

But if you stay with this girl for much longer, you'll carry the damage she causes you for the rest of your life. It will take years of therapy to deal with it, your ability to trust people not to be parasitic users will be broken, and any future relationships will be affected.

He messaged me apologizing and saying that he now understood, and that he didn't know how to deal with it. At that point I'd already moved on in a happy relationship so I was like, *okay, first of all, I appreciate the apology. Second of all, I'm not gonna be the one telling you how to fix your mess, lol, are you nuts? Ask someone who hasn't lived this nightmare because of you and leave me to my schadenfreude.* It was a bit surreal, that conversation.",2016-02-13 22:43:37+00:00,czywtdw,7.0,t1_czywdxu,748.0,relationships
3329,"*Hugs you*

Oh, honey, I know this hurts. But you know what you have to do, and putting it off will only make it worse. I've had two bad breakups in my life, relationships that saddled me with baggage that still weigh on me long after they were over. In one of them, my ex cheated on me. The other was this one. Honestly, I have *less* regrets about the cheating ex than I have about the one who just plain lost interest. The cheater disrespected our relationship, that was on *him*. But it was *my* choice to stay as long as I did in a relationship where my needs weren't being met. After the break up I kept asking myself where my self-respect went, and why I didn't leave sooner, why I wasted so much time. It took a while to restore to myself the belief that my optimism and faith in people I love weren't necessarily weaknesses--it was just bad luck that the man I was with turned out to be the wrong person to be given those gifts. At first it seemed like he was, but people change, and it wasn't my fault that he did. I would've hated myself more if I'd attempted to play coy power games where I pretended to be disinterested in order to keep his interest. That's not me.

I'm sharing this with you so that you'll know you're not alone, and that you can get over this. It will hurt like a bitch at first, maybe even for a long time. You'll miss him, and you might even wonder if maybe it wasn't so bad, maybe you can learn to live with half-measures if only you can have him back. But eventually it will feel like a relief when you no longer have to keep fighting for something that should've been offered freely by someone who's supposed to love you. You'll get there. You deserve better.",2016-02-13 21:17:34+00:00,czytxvb,5.0,t1_czyrn0t,4136.0,relationships
3330,"I can see where you're coming from because I've been there. People are criticizing you for not just outright asking him to spend Valentines Day with you, but I get why you did it. You've asked him again and again to make an effort; you've tried your best to communicate plenty of times before. It would have been nice--even if it's JUST ONCE--if he would give you affection that you didn't have to plead for, something that just came wholly from him. You wanted him to CHOOSE you without prompting, because you know that on your part, you would choose him, every time, no question. Just one gesture, right? You just needed something that you can hold on to that would reassure you that he still feels for you the big sweeping feelings that you feel for him every day. God, this is taking me back.

When I broke up with the guy who made me feel this way, I was still madly in love with him. And I was aware that he wasn't a bad person. He wasn't even maliciously trying to hurt me. It's just that he'd lost interest, somewhere along the way, and he wasn't motivated enough to work on rekindling it because at that point, my happiness just simply wasn't a priority for him. There just wasn't anywhere else to go from there, because as much as I was willing to do the hard work of keeping a relationship alive, I couldn't fight alone. I was losing my self-respect more and more every day. So I just had to let go.

In contrast, I have a friend who is also in this situation yet refuses to let go. I'm friends with both of them, actually, and the guy isn't just as invested as the girl is. They've been together ten years now. Our social circle is aware that they will stay together for as long as the girl's endurance lasts. The guy isn't gonna be the one to break it off, because why should he? He's comfortable. This woman adores him and would do anything for him. He's number one in her life. It's a good place to be. Meanwhile the girl has convinced herself that she can live without being priority number one or even number two (he also puts his friends and hobbies ahead of her) as long as she's somewhere on the list.

So even if she were hiding from everybody in her day to day life, you may have felt ""safe"" for her to keep talking to, since there's a sort of distance. I know that when my friend withdraws from everybody, she still sometimes goes on reddit or tumblr (none of us know her accounts, she just told me that this happens) where she can have ""low intensity"" interactions, of a sort. Those people aren't aware that she's having problems, so she can act like she's okay, have some sort of escape from her own dark thoughts. It's not even anything serious, just mundane stuff and normal conversations that she can't have with us because our awareness of her depression feels like the biggest thing in the room, according to her. I just think, whatever helps her cope and not retreat completely into isolation.

IMPORTANT NOTE: It took us years to get to the point where she can confide these things. Where she can accept a gesture of concern as absolutely requiring no response from her until she's ready. In the beginning all attempts to reach out made her feel guilty if she didn't have the emotional energy to respond, or to put on her ""brave face."" So I guess what I'm saying is: tread carefully.

It's not uncommon for her to crash right after something amazingly good and wonderful has happened to her.

We've learned to deal with it and give her space and love her the way she needs to be loved. (Not pressure her to come out, occasionally leave fruits outside her door, and when she comes back to the land of the living she's always dealing with the guilt of having disappeared so we try to treat her as normally as possible.) She's the most amazing, selfless, caring, and genuinely generous friend when she has the emotional energy (it hits her extra hard when she has to be selfish because that's not how she wants to be) so it's totally worth it. But it took time to learn how to love her that way. At first I was frantic with worry and showed it, but that only made her feel guilty and weak and ashamed.

3379,"You're right, I'm actually rethinking the career path I want this guy to take. Been reading up some more on composers after I got my fill of researching music school life, so I'm getting a clearer picture of what's reasonable. THANK YOU so much for giving me those names, those are going to be a big help, esp. since my guy is around 25, so really, really thank you.

To clarify, I'm not trying to make this guy recognizable to the average man on the street. I guess I'm aiming for a level of success among other musicians, those who also exist in this world. Like, if any of his dad's peers (the dad is a conductor-composer as well, let's say in one of the big five orchestras) found out what he (the son) is up to, they'd be impressed. It's a redemption story, and he has his doubters, so I kind of want a RARE something for him to have, an accomplishment that will silence those people. I mean, realistically it's probably a slow and steady climb most of the time, considering how many ambitious and talented competitors there are, but, you know. It's fiction. I already made this guy fantastically talented. Might as well go all the way, you know what I mean? Hope that makes sense. hahaha",2016-02-03 17:08:14+00:00,czmfhzn,,t1_czl9y6g,80233.0,classicalmusic

I'm still at the very basic stage of sketching out the details, so even with your disclaimers, you're already saving my ass. haha. I've been treating the studio interest thing as sort of a placeholder to indicate that I want my composer (yes, contemporary classical) to have the kind of buzz a really freaking good college athlete might have, one that all the major league teams want on their roster. Except he's kind of an even bigger deal in this world, since this dude used to play for paying audiences as young as ten years old up to mid teens, then he suddenly disappeared entirely from the public eye while his famous composer dad firmly protected his privacy, so there are all the buzz-making factors of prodigy, legacy, mystery, and notoriety at play--not to mention the talent he's been displaying in school. Now I just have to figure out how to communicate all that. 

How about if an up and coming ensemble expresses interest in doing a concert of his works?

Or, or...how do those competitions work? Do you get scouted, then invited to submit your work?

I'm not all that excited about grad school, tbh, because I need to get him away from the school and out into the wider world. But not so far away that he has to live in Europe or something. Oh, and I mentioned it in another comment, but it might be relevant here: his current fictional school is somewhat based off the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, with a few liberties taken. Like the fact that it's in Massachusetts. (I can't change that location, the story has to happen there.)

Sorry if I keep on coming up with more and more questions. This is all just so helpful to me, including the vocabulary tips for the right lingo.

Oh, and as for the rehearsals, some of them would be one-on-one, since he has a violin sonata for the freshman, while there would also be group practices for the other pieces.

My composer's this total wunderkind, one of those once in a generation talents. Also he's got impeccable musical pedigree, like his parents are pretty famous and the world's been watching him since he was a child. Anyway, things happen, blah blah blah, his teenage years are a disaster, he drops off the face of the earth for a while, then shows up at music school in his early twenties to redeem himself. Now he's in his senior year of undergrad and he's actually been obsessively composing the past four years, not to mention working on some things he wrote while he was out of the public eye. He has quite the portfolio, and maybe some studios have been watching him, showing interest in recording an album of his originals when he graduates. But first he has to put together a final exhibition of his works. And he meets this first year violinist, thinks he's got something special and wants him to be part of it.

3425,"&gt;  I can't for the love of heaven think why women find this offensive.

I can't believe I have to be the one to break this to you, buddy, but the male gaze carries with it an *implicit potential threat* that just simply isn't present when it's another woman looking at us. Now we can argue until the cows come home about the purity of your intentions (you just want to fap to it, after all) and you can choose to be offended that a stranger would choose to believe the worst of you, but there are literally thousands and thousands of years of bitter, horrifying history that have made us feel this way. Look up any statistic of violence committed against women, sexual or otherwise, and it's *overwhelmingly evident* that the threat comes from men. So yeah, we're allowed to get creeped out when a man we don't *know* or *trust* is staring at us, because we have learned the hard way that *being desired or even just noticed by men is not always safe*. Again, you can get butt hurt if you wish, but when rape prevention campaigns focus more on ""hey ladies, here's what you need to do so you don't get raped"" instead of ""HEY GUYS, HOW ABOUT YOU STOP FUCKING RAPING WOMEN"" then we get the message, clear as day, that we have to always be on the defensive because we can't afford not to be.

&gt; Which country is this?

The Philippines, ta daaa! I literally learned about this Steve Harvey clusterfuck because I came to visit my aunt and uncle and when I approached their house they were all out on the street having an impromptu goddamn neighborhood party over our third Miss Universe in history. The struggle, apparently, is real.

&gt; If you are a woman without jealousy

Of course I have felt envious, but that envy is NOT why anyone would choose to watch a beauty pageant, which may I remind you is the claim I am contesting in the first place. You said:

&gt; As pretty, thin, sexy women is deemed a threat and targeted for elimination. Thus women pay inordinate attention to females fitting the above description. And such females are aplenty in the pageant and hence women are interested

Dude. DUDE. No. Think of it this way: a casual tennis player who plays maybe once or twice a month is not gonna be sitting on her couch watching Wimbledon and eyeing the Williams sisters as a threat. The fucking Williams sisters are not her competition because they are hilariously, ridiculously, out of her league. These beauty queens have spent actual years of their time polishing what the good lord gave them and learning how to be goddesses of everything feminine, and we can appreciate that in an uncomplicated way because we sure as hell ain't about to try to ""target them for elimination,"" hahahaha oh my fucking god.

&gt; Of course you will be cheering for the contender from your state or your race, but that is beside the point.

No no no no no no no. *NOT* BESIDE THE POINT. **It is the *actual point*.** Just...trust me on this one. Trust me that the conclusions you've arrived at as an outside observer cannot be further away from the mark, because I'm sitting right in the thick of it. I'm only the tiniest bit exaggerating when I tell you that my aunt and my cousins may need actual fucking therapy to deal with the trauma of Miss Philippines not getting to do her victory walk. Steve Harvey better stay far, far away from my country in the near future, or the people might sic Manny Pacquiao on him.

&gt; Can you show me a shred of evidence supporting your claims

SOURCE: Actual woman right here, talking about female experiences.

I thought they were all gathered there for mating season or whatever, idk, I just took photo after photo. Will post in a bit (no dead fish though).

**EDIT 2:** [Now I know what these guys are doing.](http://imgur.com/0lrwreU)

There were hundreds of them, in several separate small groups by the bank of a stream. These ones were hanging out on some damp, decaying wood and palm fronds. I regret deleting the pics I took of those clustered around actual puddles, because I thought they weren't very photogenic. Dammit, past me.

Well there was this girl, she was in her twenties, and her shtick was that for every recipe, she would share a childhood memory related to that dish. Schmaltzy hallmark moments kind of stuff, and she was super earnest about it, too. At one point they were each given a super short amount of time to present a recipe in from of a live tv audience, like something less than ten minutes, and she wasted all her time waxing poetic about her idyllic youth instead of actually giving instructions.

&gt; 
&gt; **When you guys quizzed each other on Tolkien trivia, what answers did you stump him on?**

&gt; It was at a party at my house, most of the cast was there, and I'm sitting down with a glass of wine. Pete comes up and says, ""Oh, Stephen and I had this hilarious idea that you're going to have a Tolkien-off with Stephen Colbert."" And I had heard how good he was. Somebody said, ""Ah, you'll take him,"" and I said, ""I don't think so. I think this is going to be really bad."" And we were probably the only two people in the room who knew if we were getting it right or wrong! [Laughs] Afterward, there was one where I thought, ""No, he got that wrong."" And he actually wrote me a very sweet letter afterward, and he said, ""I think I got one wrong.""
&gt; 
&gt; **Which one?**

&gt; *Who built the Argonath?* And I also got him on, Which of the dwarves is not related by blood to Thorin Oakenshield? He got me on all the great elvish questions. In my defense, I hadn't been able to read The Silmarillion in like the last fourteen years, because we don't own the rights, and so we've deliberately kept away from a lot of that stuff.

3611,"Oh, hun. I'm sorry to say you're not doing yourself any favors with those links you posted. 

1) The first one is decidedly NOT a scientific study, and even the author acknowledges that it's just his own take. 

Quote:

&gt; Here’s **my** stab.

So, nope, unacceptable.


2) The second one is literally a magazine article. I would've hoped you knew this, but a magazine is not a scientific journal. ALSO, HILARIOUSLY, IT DISAGREES WITH YOU. (Remember you said it would be IMPOSSIBLE to fall in love with more than one person. Don't try to squirm out of it because it's right there.)

Quote: 

&gt; But is it actually possible to love two people at once—or are the tortured souls who think they do just kidding themselves? 

&gt;The answer is a resounding yup, says Ramani Durvasula, Ph.D., clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology at UCLA. “We assume love comes in one flavor, but it’s really much more Baskin Robbins than that.” In other words, chocolate chip mint and strawberry are different, but they’re both damn good. If only love were as easy as ice cream.

&gt;“We are complex and complicated beings, and it’s very possible that two different traits in two different people can both appeal to us,” says Durvasula. As you grow and develop as an individual, you might find yourself drawn to people who complement different aspects of who you are. 

3) Again, oh my god, YOUR OWN SOURCE DISAGREES WITH YOU. I'm actually dying, lmao.

Quote:

&gt;Empirical evidence clearly suggests that humans are capable of loving and having sex with more than one person at the same time. Indeed, most people I interviewed for the book, In the Name of Love: Romantic Ideology and its Victims, said that they can romantically love, and actually have loved, a few people at the same time.

But again, sweetie, this is NOT a peer-reviewed study, sorry.

You literally could not have failed any harder at reading comprehension, oh my god. This is priceless. Also, you can keep on begging for me to prove my claims, but you'll be sadly disappointed.

3616,"Oh, we're still doing this then? Fine. Okay. Let me make this as simple as I can for you:

The burden of proof (look it up, I can't spoonfeed you everything) rests on the one who made the assertion. *This* assertion:

&gt; Its scientifically impossible to be in love with two people unless those two people desire you as well.

Remember that? *You* said that. Now, the phrase ""scientifically proven"" carries some weight for any educated person. It means, if someone asks you for the source, you can point to a peer-reviewed study or research that supports your claims. Not a blog post from a random person or a yahoo.com article or even your personal diary, but actual published work by reputable academics. There's really no wiggle room in that. Sorry, those are the rules. I'm not the one who makes them.

So when you burst forth with your own flood of feelings? IRRELEVANT. Not scientific. Not what I was asking for. *Not what you implied when you invoked science.* You wasted your time typing that, honestly, because I asked for scientific data and that's not what you gave. I'd feel bad for you, but I honestly didn't think my request was hard to understand.

When you're asking for my personal experiences? ALSO IRRELEVANT. Not to mention I'm not the one who needs to prove anything. Again, burden of proof, remember? You're the one who made the original assertion. The only reason I would have to pour my heart out would be to help OP, but I've already done that, and she's gone from this thread (see the [deleted] right next to the post title?) so she's not really going to see it.

There's an oft-repeated phrase here that applies: if someone shows you who they are, believe them. This girl has proven that she can be selfish to the point of cruelty, and if OP takes her back, it will only show her how far she can push him. She says she wants another chance, but the sad thing is if you do give her what she wants, there's no way she'll respect you for it. It's hard to respect someone who doesn't respect himself.

If I were you, OP, I'd take this incredibly painful thing that happened and use it as a kick in the pants for a much needed life-change. Don't deprive yourself of the wealth of experiences out there just because you're still wasting time and energy on someone who doesn't deserve it. I know it's terrifying, but if you power through that fear and step out of your comfort zone, there might even come a time when you look back and see this heartache as the luckiest thing that ever happened to you.",2015-12-14 20:16:06+00:00,cxz0fso,2.0,t1_cxyju8e,33101.0,relationships

But yeah, the collective unconscious is one of my favorite, favorite things that I've ever learned. I came across it while studying Jungian psychoanalysis and just latched onto it as a lover of stories--it explains how distinct cultures distant from each other have strikingly similar myths and folktales. We're all drawing from the same ""soup,"" as Tolkien would say. Thus we have Prometheus bound to a rock and pecked daily by an eagle, Odin hanging on the world tree wounded by his own spear, and Jesus Christ nailed to the cross with his side pierced by a centurion. There are [flood myths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flood_myths) from all over the world, where a great deluge serves as both punishment and cleansing that only the worthy survive.

[**The Act of Creation Will Be Your Salvation**](http://archiveofourown.org/works/401961) by [scifigrl47](http://archiveofourown.org/users/scifigrl47/pseuds/scifigrl47)

&gt; One of my absolute favorites. Main focus is on Tony in his capacity as robotics genius/engineer, and his relationship with his creations (lots of love for the bots and JARVIS). Covers the time from when he created Dummy as a teenager up to his post-Avengers life with the team living in the tower. Lots of artist!Steve, too, and awesome teammates being awesome. Mutual pining, angst that resolves into warm and fluffy feelings, clever dialogue, and some of the best writing in the fandom. It's a self-contained story on its own, but if you can't get enough, it's only the start to an amazing [series](http://archiveofourown.org/series/18990).

Another incredible fic by the same writer is [**Four \(Or Five\) Reasons for Kidnapping Tony Stark**](http://archiveofourown.org/works/391599), but it's very action/adventure and they spend most of the fic apart (the slowest of slow burns, I tell ya). It's actually part of another [series](http://archiveofourown.org/series/18228) with some pre-slash fics coming in before this (along with some that are not Steve/Tony centric), but it can stand on its own. The actual payoff to the slow burn comes in the follow up, [**Dating the Long Way Round**](http://archiveofourown.org/works/525371), which is also very action-y but with Steve and Tony actually together this time. Awesome, awesome read.

[**Homefront**](http://archiveofourown.org/works/520775) by [copperbadge](http://archiveofourown.org/users/copperbadge/pseuds/copperbadge)

&gt; After those novel-length recs, this is relatively short, but still very worthwhile. Set post Avengers with the team living together, and Steve is shown dealing with the losses he's suffered and the upheaval of being in another time, while Tony tries his best to help. Steve is portrayed as very human, and Tony is shown with that huge capacity for kindness that he hides under the snark. Copperbadge writes some of the best Steve and Tony portrayals I've ever seen, and I want to rec basically all his fics, except he doesn't do slow burn very often and that's what you were looking for. Give his other works a look, though.

I lived in a tiny dorm room on the fourth floor with one other roommate. Our windows were screened and there were no trees or other nearby buildings outside, but one night around 3 am I suddenly woke up when my roommate Amy threw her pillow at me. I sat up and was about to ask her what the fuck, then I saw she was huddled on her bed against the wall looking scared, and there was a little black cat on the floor between our beds. Then I did ask her what the fuck, where did the cat come from, weren't we forbidden from having pets? Apparently she just woke up and it was there. Our windows were closed. Our door was locked. And Amy was afraid to put her feet on the floor to let the cat out. 

I was still kind of groggy and just wanted to go to sleep and deal with it in the morning, so I got up, opened the door, led the cat to the hallway, and let it out the fire escape. It went willingly enough. Then I went back to bed and gave Amy back her pillow.

It kept happening like once or twice a month during that first semester. Just that same cat reappearing in our room in the wee hours of the night, but never when we're staying up late.

Yes, absolutely, there would be a difference, because it acknowledges Rosalind as a powerful threat in her own right, and not just as something you take away from the hero to hurt him.

Rosalind? Coulson slept with her *once*.

* to emphasize a theme (the cruelty of fate or whatever, if this were that kind of show)
* they had no further purpose in the plot (Agent 33 is an example of this, that never got my hackles up)
* etc.

Bad reason to kill off a character:

* to get a reaction out of another character

I mean. They actually explicitly said it in the dialogue. When Ward called Coulson, Coulson said something like, ""You killed Rosalind because she was going against Malick?"" And Ward replied, ""No, this is personal. I wanted you to feel the pain, etc etc."" 

That was just lazy, weak writing. We've seen this arc eleventy billion times before.

4261,"&gt; One or more of the stories had the settlers genetically modified to suit their new environment.

This is called [pantropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantropy),  ""a hypothetical process of space colonization in which rather than terraforming other planets or building space habitats suitable for human habitation, humans are modified (for example via genetic engineering) to be able to thrive in the existing environment.""

A writer named James Blish named that concept, and he wrote one of the more notable anthologies of sci fi stories featuring the trope. It was called [*The Seedling Stars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Blish#The_Seedling_Stars_.28Pantropy.29). 

If that's not it, there's also the short story [*Desertion* by Clifford D. Simak](http://bestsciencefictionstories.com/2009/05/17/desertion-by-clifford-d-simak/) with the same trope, though it was written before Blish named it. If that's the story you remember, then it shouldn't be too hard to find anthologies which contain it.

But if he's this unkind and mercenary in other areas of your life together, then it's basically a lost cause.

4477,"There's a theory called **""5 love languages""** that proposes that most human beings primarily understand and express love in 5 different ways:

&gt;**1. words of affirmation**

&gt;**2. quality time**

&gt;**3. acts of service**

&gt;**4. gifts**

&gt;**5. physical touch**


I'm guessing yours is *words of affirmation*. You express your love verbally, are generous with praise and compliments, and you also feel the most loved when your SO does the same for you. It can get tricky if your SO's love language is different. For example, my love language is *quality time*. If I got into a relationship with someone whose love language is *words*, he could tell me that he loved me ten times a day, but if he never has time to just sit and spend time with me--I'm always going to feel like something's missing. It's like he's telling me ""te amo,"" and that's great and all, I do understand a bit of Spanish, but it's not gonna have the same visceral impact as ""I love you."" We're speaking different languages.

People whose love language is *gifts* are not necessarily materialistic. For them, receiving a gift is not about its material value--it's evidence that their loved one is thinking of them and *knows* them, knows what will make them happy. You can tell it's not materialism on their part because they're just as excited about *giving* gifts as they are about receiving them. My sister, for example, is like this. She can't go shopping without picking up little things here and there that remind her of someone she loves--a bookmark, a figurine, a key chain. I've observed her present a gift to someone and I can see the anticipation on her face as she watches for that person's reaction--she gets as much joy out of it as when she's the one on the receiving end. That's how she speaks and understands love.

There's no ranking of which love language is better or has more impact. There's only the necessary effort to figure out which one your SO has and learning to speak it. For example, if your love language is *physical touch*, but your SO's is *acts of service*, maybe try making dinner or offering to back up their files in addition to your usual repertoire of hugs and kisses. Watch them respond. It's likely they will be more receptive to learning your love language in return.

**tl;dr:** People have different ways of self-expression. Why should it be different when it comes to love?",2015-11-06 22:53:47+00:00,cwr7pyw,2.0,t1_cwr3fmy,6576.0,AskReddit

He was just hanging out with our tight-knit group of friends who were all supporting me and basically got to watch the break up happen from my side. He even got to read the last email I sent Kent for closure (a bunch of them were looking over my shoulder before I hit ""send"" like the overinvested dorks they were).

Jack said he fell in love with me during that time. He got to see me while I was obviously hurting and still trying to be fair and kind to the person who was breaking my heart. He said the way that I handled myself and acknowledged my own part of the problem really made an impression on him, though of course he didn't act on anything until a few months later when I was in a better place.

My father and my prof were in the same department, and, like I said, they were friends.  That day in class, Prof. Tan was supposed to tell us about this symposium that all physics students had to attend, only he forgot the details like the date, venue, etc. So he asked me to please text my dad for the info (he didn't have his phone) so that he could make the announcement by the end of the class. So I did, and we all began taking the exam scheduled for that day. My dad's reply came in halfway through the test, and I wanted to call Prof. Tan's attention. Only my brain was still floating in exam-space and the last thing I read was my father's name on my phone screen, so instead of raising my hand and calling out, ""Professor Tan?"" I raised my hand and called out, ""Daddy?"" instead. I don't even know how I finished that exam.

4555,"&gt; Your friend is not owed your time at work. 

True enough, but come on. The friend was in a terrifying (to him) situation, and he needed someone that he trusted to be there. Plus, it was only LATER THAT SAME NIGHT when they talked. There was still a lot of residual emotion, and OP's responses were not as tactful as they could have been. I think we all can give the friend an allowance for his deeply upset reaction here and not assume that he was being too self-entitled and unreasonable. They're *friends*. That carries a certain expectation of being there for each other, and he's reacting from a place of hurt that she wasn't there for him.

I'm NOT saying OP should disregard her boundaries and treat people she's not comfortable treating from now on. She **should** uphold that boundary, but at this point I think her focus should be in extending a heartfelt, non-defensive apology, if she wants to keep this friend. Sure, she didn't understand how bad his anxiety was, and there were other misunderstandings at play, but the issue won't be fixed by cold, uncompromising logic at this point.

(Yeah, you just clip it. In it's natural environment (growing on trees), an offshoot will just grow heavier and heavier as it grows until it lands on another part of the tree trunk/branch and take root there, and the connecting shoot between it and the mother plant will just decay or snap off on its own. What I'm saying is there's not exactly a set amount of time before you need to remove the offshoot from the mother plant, just use your best judgment. As long as it has its own roots which look reasonably sturdy, it'll be alright.)",2015-10-24 15:13:04+00:00,cwb6wtd,3.0,t1_cwb6k5k,729.0,botany

4693,"Got everything to do with how white people colonized the country for 350 years and very effectively brainwashed the people to think of their own culture as inferior and primitive, presenting the white way of doing things as the only civilized option. Before colonists came to the Philippines, there was *no* Philippines, just a bunch of  tribes and sultanates with their own governments and cultures. So basically the foundation of the Filipino national identity was laid down by invaders whose best interest dictated that the natives see themselves as second class citizens and the white man as their savior.

4713,"OP, I'm so sorry, I know this sucks and you're frustrated and hurt. But there's no way to turn back time and redo the day, so let's deal with how to move forward.

From your responses, it seems like you have a wife who's awesome and fairly reasonable--except for this strange behavior. Like most people here, I'm betting this anomaly is just the tip of the iceberg. There's probably a whole mess of insecurities lurking beneath the surface, but you may not be able to drag it out into the open right now, especially since she's on the defensive. If she opens up and agrees to therapy, that's awesome. You absolutely need to follow through on that. But if she doesn't, the best thing you can do for your marriage is to cultivate a pattern and style of communication which will help you avoid conflicts like this in the future and make her feel safe enough to let you in on the most vulnerable parts of her heart that she's been protecting with her tried and tested defense mechanisms. You can start on that by having a calm discussion about how to handle your friends and family asking about the wedding album. Help her understand how hurt you are and how important this was for you, but when it comes to talking to other people about the matter, have her back. You won't be devaluing your feelings, but you'll be setting a tone for your marriage that as far as the rest of the world is concerned, you're a team. The more she feels safe and secure with you, the more communicative she'll be.

In the meantime, while she's in therapy (or in the process of wrestling with the fact that she needs therapy), I suggest you deal with her anti-photography stance as your ""price of admission"" to the relationship. No matter awesome your partner is, there's always gonna be something about them that will drive you crazy, that you will just have to deal with and forgive, in order to enjoy the other wonderful things about them. Focus on the positive. So you don't have photos of your wedding--you still get to be married to the love of your life and remember her as a stress-free and happy bride. Maybe someday you can have a photoshoot on an anniversary or even sooner, but for right now concentrate on making happy memories instead of capturing them.",2015-10-06 13:24:12+00:00,cvq1j2w,1.0,t3_3novni,10396.0,relationships

A little later he started twirling a straw wrapper around his finger, and after a while I took his now-curly straw wrapper and tried to curl it into a tighter spiral. Then I lost interest in that and reached over for the unused paper napkins by the side of his plate and started tearing those to shreds. Then I took his empty coffee cup from in front of him and just kinda played with it and my own cup. All of this was very absent minded, you see, most of our attention was on our conversation. I actually only realized what I'd been doing when we both stood up to leave, checked the table to make sure we didn't leave anything behind, and laughed because we both noticed what a mess my side of the table was, while his was bare.

Like, if I suddenly wanted to build a boat, I would not only know everything about how to design it to be the best fucking boat ever, but also stuff like the entire history of boats and even the chemical reactions happening inside the wood and stuff as the boat is exposed to the environment. Anything from theoretical shit like the multiverse theory to international events like the Syrian refugee crisis to the most mundane puzzles like what's making that weird sound in the air conditioner--I could educate myself about all the facts and nuances of anything I'm interested in, all in a split second.

4861,"Your girlfriend's concerns are valid, dude. It's not only the fact that she's your ex, there's also the matter of you having a history of cheating on an SO. Not saying you're gonna do it to her, but you can't undo the past. It's completely understandable why your gf is very, very uncomfortable with this.

&gt;I just don't know what to do my ex and I were best friends for so long it doesn't feel right to just tell her I don't want to be friends any more for no reason.

It's not for no reason. Your wonderful, amazing gf is actively being hurt by your friendship. You say your relationship doesn't have any major problems except this, so this is obviously important enough for her to make it a big deal. And honestly? It's not an unreasonable request that she's making.

This is where ""you can't have your cake and eat it, too"" comes in. You're gonna have to make a choice between your relationship and your friendship. The two obviously cannot co-exist, so ask yourself which one you want to keep.",2015-09-29 21:18:33+00:00,cvik6as,1.0,t3_3mvpnw,1781.0,relationships
4862,"I am NOT saying abuse isn't possible, but the examples you give point more to immaturity and insecurity than anything else. Not just on her part, but yours as well, since some of these issues seem like they stem from the lack of serious conversations where you set boundaries, such as how you divide your time between each other and your other friends. Even her negative comments, especially about other women, point strongly to a whole lot of insecurity on her part, which is understandable given her history. 

The only thing that made me stop and think was her blowing off your concerns and calling you too sensitive. But since you weren't very specific, I don't know. Could be abuse, could be immaturity, or hey--maybe you are really too sensitive. It happens.

**You may have other concerns that you haven't shared that might undeniably point to abuse. If so, I strongly urge you to talk to someone qualified and not rely on a pamphlet.** 

But based on what you've shared, she just comes across as insecure and clingy, but not to the point of being abusive. Her baggage probably has a lot to do with it, as well as her age, and she just needs to heal and grow up.

4979,"I have an uncle, my father's cousin, who is one of the strangest men I have ever met. I don't know him or his parents that well, but my dad stayed with them for a few months while he was in college. He's in his early 50's and appears to be of sound mind and body, but seems very...young, for some reason. He's egotistical and spoiled, yet intimidated by so many things around him, and can hardly make a decision by himself. His conversation is chock full of phrases like ""Mama thinks that..."" or ""Papa said that..."" My dad told me that he was raised very, very protectively by his parents--never allowed to play basketball with other boys, never made to do any chores, never encouraged to have any hobbies apart from accompanying his mother to church activities with her other conservative, devout Catholic friends. My impression of him, the few times we met, was of a man who has been...emasculated, for lack of a better term. Yet he just got married a few years ago to a gorgeous, younger woman, who moved in with him and his parents (they all live in the same house). His parents never relinquished their control of his life.

I was talking about him to my dad, and he sighed and said that his older brother had been so different. I was surprised. I never even knew there was another son. Apparently, his parents had put a ban on ever bringing him up. He had been confident, bold, independent, according to my father. He resisted his parents' control, and had just graduated college and was on the brink of accepting a job offer in another city. This caused no small amount of conflict in their family, with the parents forbidding him to go. A week before he was supposed to leave, he just...died. We don't know how. He was in perfect health. His parents said he just collapsed suddenly and was dead on arrival to the E.R. There was a quick funeral that most of the extended family was unable to get to, since they lived far away from other relatives. Then word quickly got around that nobody was supposed to bring him up, or risk upsetting the elderly parents who both had cardiac conditions. He died more than 20 years ago and last month was the first time I ever learned that he existed.

**tl,dr:** My weird uncle's brother may have committed suicide to escape controlling parents. Or he may have been killed by them. Nobody knows for sure.",2015-09-24 17:04:55+00:00,cvcqt05,1.0,t3_3m6z28,15237.0,AskReddit

5082,"Okay, /u/sexy_mummies. You're just going about your day, being sexy, being a mummy, and you decide to drop by on an ask reddit thread and express a harmless opinion. You didn't ask for what's about to happen. But it's 4:42 am where I am, I just rewatched Pacific Rim, and you're probably the only person who's ever gonna read this, so there's a torrent of flailing coming your way. I am deeply sorry.

**Here, in unnecessary YET STILL INCOMPLETE detail, is why I love Pacific Rim:**

**SPOILER ALERT HOLY CANNOLI SUCH SPOILERS MUCH ALERT**

• Okay, so **Raleigh Becket**. Terrible tragedy makes for compelling back story, everything's going as expected. He drops out of everybody's sight, gets all scruffy and broody, wears the battle weary look really well. Stacker Pentecost comes to drag him back to the war and I fully expected him to carry his angst as an armor around himself and  be the dark, dramatic, asshole type because HE KNOWS PAIN, DAMMIT, it was in the first fifteen minutes of the movie. But then. BUT THEN. He gets to the Thunderdome and is actually respectful to everyone??? And nice to the Kaiju geek who was accidentally insensitive? And holds his temper when the hotshot ranger is rude at him and is all humble when Mako Mori criticizes him? HOLY CRAP ARE WE GETTING AN EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT HERO? WE ARE, YES WE ARE. Apparently he worked out all his shit while, I dunno, welding rivets or something (do you weld rivets?) at the wall and now he's here all accepting of the burden of his regrets yet willing to put himself back out there again. And it's not just physical battle that he's being asked to do, it's to lay himself bare once again, total emotional vulnerability in the drift. He's shown as ready and open for what's to come, and then the narrative shifts its spotlight to someone else.

• The someone else is **Mako Mori**. She lost her family at a young age, spent her formative years learning how to be a badass, and is now all gung ho to rain down sweet, sweet revenge upon the kaiju. She's the one with the immediate, compelling journey to take. She isn’t the prize at the end or the motivation for the broody male hero to tear down his walls and let go of his emotional hang ups. IT'S THE OTHER FUCKING WAY AROUND. Raleigh is in the perfect position to help her keep her shit together so that she can finally avenge her family and they can all overcome and triumph and kick massive amounts of alien ass. Also, ALSO, did I mention she's ASIAN? And that her ethnicity is respected and honored yet--wonder of wonders--not fetishized??? Honestly I could cry.

• I'm taking pity on you now, pal, so I won't go through the entire roster of characters. Probably three bullet points is enough. So: **the worldbuilding**. Take a look at that sweet, sweet worldbuilding. There is kaiju poop disposal happening in Manila. Kaiju cults popping up everywhere. Kaiju game shows on television. A thriving black market for people who need alien monster bones to help their own boners along. Hannibal Chau exists! I want to know more about Hannibal Chau. I want to know more about the Chinese triplets, and the Russians, because they live in a world that feels real and believable and fascinating. It's not just New York with a damaged Lady Liberty.  And yet, for all that we get a really deep sense of how the kaiju have changed and ravaged this world, there are no gratuitous scenes of civilian casualties. They duke it out in the middle of the ocean or through empty streets. The writers don't need to show us innocent people being squashed beneath falling buildings to get us to care about the outcome of the battles. That's because they've done a fantastic job building this world and the audience wants to see it survive.

So yeah. That's why I, and probably your friends as well, are nuts about Pacific Rim. I'm not gonna ramble on about the fight scenes or the effects because well, you saw them in the theater. And if it was just cool battles or awesome CGI I would probably have forgotten this movie already after a week. But it just gave me so many things that I've stopped expecting or even hoping for from a big blockbuster, and I honestly haven't recovered from the surprise even now.

If you stay, your own efforts may keep this relationship limping on for quite a while longer, but don't expect him to ever meet you halfway. You'll be bitterly disappointed every time.

It's about the youngest daughter of a king/sultan who was being watched by the Prince of the Sky from above. He came to her and they fell in love and got married. Then he was gonna take her back to his home in the sky, but the journey was fraught with danger. They set off on his white horse and there were like three obstacles that they had to go through, but I only remember two of them. One was a forest full of sharp, cutting leaves. The prince told his bride to hang on, took out his kris, and swung it left and right to clear a way for them. The final obstacle just before his palace was a rainbow bridge. The prince told the princess that she must hold on to him, close her eyes, and never, ever open them until he says it's safe to do so. She agreed, and they started to cross the bridge, and instantly there were all these voices coming from below the rainbow, calling out to the princess and pleading with her or tempting her to look down. She resisted, until one voice turn out to be her dead mother's, calling out her name. She couldn't help it--she opened her eyes and looked, and she let go of the prince and fell down, down, down and was never seen again. The prince sadly traveled on to his palace and never came back down to earth.

But in a critical situation like this, the well being of my loved one is going to be the first fucking priority, no question. I can't wrap my head around it, either.",2015-08-21 20:51:14+00:00,cub3lbu,5.0,t1_cub37eg,609.0,relationships
5221,"His rules aren't even all that weird, to be fair. What's weird is that he can't weigh them against the reality of the situation and insists on clinging to them at the cost of the well being of the actual human being he says he loves.

5222,"""She's feeling pressured?"" Seriously? Feeling pressured is getting nagged, or hearing snide comments, even receiving lectures. This woman is experiencing actual physical attacks that she can't escape because she has no job and no money. Her insane parents are taking precedence right now  because they are the ones holding power over her. This is not a brat throwing a tantrum, this is someone desperate for a way out.",2015-08-21 20:22:37+00:00,cub2i1q,4.0,t1_cuawlsx,8926.0,relationships
5223,"Then there's really nothing more to be said, is there? Your idea of the way it should be is that important to you, which is your prerogative to decide. But that puts her in an untenable position. She has no job and thus can't live away from her family home, so she has to bend to her parents' will in order to survive. That's her reality, no matter how painful it is. You've already decided you can't give up your ideals for her, so the only other thing you have in your power to do is let her go. Have some pity ffs.",2015-08-21 20:17:37+00:00,cub2b4i,3.0,t1_cuavlqb,10076.0,relationships
5224,"You know what, I think your reading is right. In that same comment he refers to her as his ""leading lady."" This guy  seems to have a script for how he wants his life to go, and that's more important to him than anything else, even the woman he says he loves.  [I quote](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3hvafx/my_29m_girlfriend_25f_wants_me_to_marry_her_like/cuavlqb):  

&gt;I think I'm at a great age and have found a great leading lady. I just really, really don't wanna do this any other way than the way I feel is right, and it seems that I care enough about it even if it means sacrificing the relationship.",2015-08-21 20:06:59+00:00,cub1wg2,2.0,t1_cuaw3uq,8712.0,relationships
5225,"Read again what you wrote. She is in an actual abusive situation and you don't seem to feel any urgency about helping her get out. Frankly the woman sounds desperate. She loves you and she has her own wishes for her engagement and wedding, but she is at the point where she'd rather break it off with you and lose everything just so she can get some relief. But you have this pretty little list that you want to check off before actually taking her out of the toxic situation she's in. 

All your rules are fine and wonderful, OP, and if this is just normal nagging and snide comments from her family, nothing would be wrong in standing your ground. BUT SHE IS ACTUALLY SUFFERING. She is being attacked, she is under unrelenting stress and violence. You typed out those words yourself, but your attitude is that this is something you are perfectly willing to ask her to endure longer until you get everything just how you want it. The fuck? I would have thought someone who's really in love would be rushing to get her out of that toxic situation no matter what. That's what I don't get.

You are stubbornly clinging to your fantasies, OP, while your girlfriend is being battered by the real world. It's like someone is dying of thirst but you won't give her water to drink from the tap because you're too busy trying to get champagne.",2015-08-21 19:55:56+00:00,cub1gv2,5.0,t1_cuazp35,2734.0,relationships
5226,"This. It's a legitimate condition, OP, and it may not make sense to you, the way that repeated washing of hands (as a well known example), won't make sense to anyone who doesn't have OCD.

This girl you say you love is *literally* physically and emotionally suffering in a toxic situation that you can help her escape, but you're actually prioritizing the opinions of other people  who are not even all that close to you. I can't wrap my head around this. Break up with this poor woman, OP, at least the family's abuse will abate. She is going through a lot for you, and you can't even put her well being over your selfish whims.",2015-08-21 18:02:22+00:00,cuawyd9,3.0,t1_cuavdkp,2286.0,relationships
