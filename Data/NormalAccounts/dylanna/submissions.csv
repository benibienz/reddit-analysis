Le Guin, in [*The Language of the Night: Essays on Fantasy and Science Fiction*](https://books.google.com.ph/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=ksOjjuy3issC&amp;q=soldiers#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fantasy%20is%20escapist%2C%20and%20that%20is%20its%20glory%22&amp;f=false) writes:

&gt; There is an area where SF has most often failed to judge itself, and where it has been most harshly judged by its nonpartisans. It is an area where we badly need intelligent criticism and discussion. The oldest argument against SF is both the shallowest and the profoundest: the assertion that SF, like all fantasy, is escapist.
&gt; 
&gt; This statement is shallow when made by the shallow. When an insurance broker tells you that SF doesn’t deal with the Real World, when a chemistry freshman informs you that Science has disproved Myth, when a censor suppresses a book because it doesn’t fit the canons of Socialist Realism, and so forth, that’s not criticism; it’s bigotry. If it’s worth answering, the best answer is given by Tolkien, author, critic, and scholar. Yes, he said, fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is imprisoned by the enemy, don’t we consider it his duty to escape? The moneylenders, the knownothings, the authoritarians have us all in prison; if we value the freedom of the mind and soul, if we’re partisans of liberty, then it’s our plain duty to escape, and to take as many people with us as we can.

*******

The Tolkien reference is pointing to his influential essay ""On Fairy Stories,"" which is also a really, really good read for any SF fan ([PDF here](http://brainstorm-services.com/wcu-2004/fairystories-tolkien.pdf)).

&gt; I have claimed that Escape is one of the main functions of fairy-stories, and since I do not disapprove of them, it is plain that I do not accept the tone of scorn or pity with which “Escape” is now so often used: a tone for which the uses of the word outside literary criticism give no warrant at all. [...] Why should a man be scorned if, finding himself in prison, he tries to get out and go home? Or if, when he cannot do so, he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison-walls? The world outside has not become less real because the prisoner cannot see it. In using escape in this way the critics have chosen the wrong word, and, what is more, they are confusing, not always by sincere error, the Escape of the Prisoner with the Flight of the Deserter.",Fantasy,In defense of escapism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5c0ncp/in_defense_of_escapism/

141,2016-09-25 17:00:43+00:00,self.movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/54fz5x/some_of_my_favorite_bits_of_behindthescenes/,False,"I don't have much time but I just wanna share a few of these:


• The first scene they ever filmed was the one in the Fire Swamp. While Cary Elwes (Westley) and Robin Wright (Buttercup) were delivering their lines, Rob Reiner (director) kept calling cut because he could hear a ""strange incantation or chanting"" weaving faintly through the audio. They gathered around to replay the tape and they could all hear it. Cary writes:

&gt; The ADs spread out and began searching the swamp, listening for the sound. I think it was Rob who eventually discovered Bill (William Goldman, writer) standing behind a giant toadstool, rocking back and forth, with his fingers crossed in his mouth, mumbling under his breath. 
&gt; 
&gt; “Bill, what are you doing?” Rob asked quizzically. 
&gt; 
&gt; Embarrassed, Bill stammered as he removed his hands from his mouth, “Oh,  I’m, er... I was just praying. Why?” 
&gt; 
&gt; “You can’t talk on the set, Bill. Not while we’re filming. The microphones pick up everything.” 
&gt; 
&gt; Bill lowered his head. “Oh my gosh! I’m sorry,” he said. “I was just a little excited, I guess.”

• The second scene they filmed was the one where Buttercup's dress catches on fire and Westley puts it off. They had a big safety meeting before they started filming, which Bill Goldman missed because he stepped out of the set. He returned right in the middle of the first take. Cary writes:

&gt; As soon as he saw Robin on fire he naturally thought there had been some sort of an accident. Thus, he yelled out something to the effect of “OH, MY GOD! HER DRESS IS ON FIRE! SHE’S ON FIRE!!!” effectively ruining another take. After yelling “Cut!” Rob calmly turned to Goldman and said, “Bill, it’s supposed to catch on fire, remember?”

William Goldman recalls:

&gt; I remember turning to Rob and saying, “You’re setting fire to Robin on the first day?! What are you nuts? It’s not like we can replace her!”

• In the scene outside the Fire Swamp where Humperdinck orders Count Rugen to take Westley away, they couldn't make it look convincing when Rugen hits Westley on the head with the hilt of his sword and knocks him out. So Elwes just told Christopher Guest to actually hit him lightly so that they could get the timing right. They didn't have a rubber sword, but Elwes insisted that using the metal sword would be okay. So Guest hit him with the hilt, a little harder than he intended, and Elwes actually passed out. He woke up in the emergency room, still in costume, with his scalp getting stitched up. That was the take they used in the movie.

• Mandy Patinkin on playing  Iñigo Montoya:

&gt; It was 1986. My father died in 1972. I read that script and I wanted to play Inigo because my mind immediately went, If I can get that six-fingered man, then I’ll have my father back, in my imaginary world. He’ll be alive in my imagination. So that was it for me. It was like, I’ll become the greatest sword fighter, and my reward will not be to be in this movie that ended up being what it’s become to all these people; my reward will be that my father will come back.


• The introduction of the story, with the kid and the grandfather, apparently resonated a lot with Cary Elwes because he had a very close relationship with his grandfather, who used to tell him stories of all his adventures in faraway places as a British spy. Cary was excited about doing the movie because his granddad knew the book and was thrilled that he got the role of Westley. Unfortunately, his granddad fell ill while they were making the film, and the day after they finished filming ""the Greatest Swordfight of All Time,"" Cary went to visit him in the hospital. He writes:

&gt; When I went to visit him in the hospital he was only semilucid. Age and the medication the doctors had given him had sapped his strength. Nevertheless, as I sat by his side and held his hand, I told him all about the shoot and how fun it had been. About André the Giant. About the swordfight, and how much he would enjoy watching it on the big screen one day. And then it dawned on me. It seemed as if the roles had been reversed. Here I was, the grandson recounting tales of adventure to the grandfather. At the end of it, I kissed him tenderly on the cheek. Then, unable to fight back the tears, I told him how much I loved him. I realized I was actually having my “As You Wish” moment with him. It appeared that he understood what I was saying. I’d like to think so, anyway. Sadly, he passed away in the early hours of the following morning, surrounded by his close friends and family.

• The last scene Cary and Robin filmed was The Kiss. It was supposed to kick the asses out of every other kiss in history, and they did their best to live up to that standard. They got it right the first time. Cary writes:

&gt; After the first take, Rob called out, “Cut and print!” 
&gt; 
&gt; “Ummm, I’m sorry, I didn’t quite feel right about that one, Rob. Can we try again?” I asked sheepishly, stifling a laugh. 
&gt; 
&gt; Rob just smiled and said, “Sure, Cary. Why not?”
&gt; 
&gt;  After the second take, again Rob said, “Print that!” 
&gt; 
&gt; Then Robin asked for another. “Yeah! We need to go again, Rob, please.” 
&gt; 
&gt; Then I asked for another. So it went, three more takes, all of which concluded with the same directive from Rob: “Cut and print!” We ended up shooting six takes of that kiss. After printing them all, Rob finally turned to Ceri, our script supervisor, and said after the last one, “That’s a beauty! Print that, too.” He then walked up to us on our horses and said: “Uh, guys? I think we got it!”

Robin Wright recalls:

&gt; It was so beautiful, the true love for Westley...Cary was so perfect in that role. He was so dashing and funny and goodlooking. And we will always have a special relationship because of this film.
&gt; 

There's so much more in the book, guys. Awesome deets about the making of the swordfight between The Man in Black and Iñigo Montoya, *lots* of great stories about Andre the Giant that I just don't have the time to summarize right now (he was really well-loved by them all), hilarious anecdotes about the making of the Miracle Max scene, and heartwarming tales of how the cast and crew became a found family while filming on location. It seemed like such a great, positive experience for all of them, which is wonderful to know since I love the movie so much. 

I might add more trivia later if I find the time, but I do recommend reading [the book](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21412202-as-you-wish).

**But first, a disclaimer:**

I'm fully aware that **Kingsman: The Secret Service** is a (super) fun action movie and I'm not supposed to overthink it. So this plot hole doesn't really take away from my enjoyment of the movie. But. Well. It's a pretty big plot hole, if we can't explain it away.

**So, a refresher:**

#SPOILERS AHOY

In the first half of the movie, [Harry Hart/Galahad confronts Professor Arnold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj2-VWJotuQ) about his ""kidnapping,"" and just as Prof. Arnold is about to reveal crucial information, the chip that Valentine implanted in him explodes and kills him (and causes Harry to fall into a coma). In a later scene, Valentine complains to Gazelle about losing the professor (""He made me kill Professor Arnold! I goddamn loved Professor Arnold!"") and it's revealed that the implant is also a surveillance device that can record audio and transmit in real time.

In the second half of the movie, after Galahad's ""death,"" it's revealed that Chester King/Arthur has gone over to Valentine's side. He [tries to manipulate Eggsy](http://cdn1-www.superherohype.com/assets/uploads/gallery/kingsman-the-secret-service/kingsman0010.jpg) into joining him by telling him of Valentine's plan, and when that fails to convince him, he activates the poison that he put in Eggsy's glass. Unknown to Arthur, Eggsy switched the glasses after noticing the implant's scar behind Arthur's ear. Eggsy makes a quip about being light-fingered, and Chester dies after cursing him out.

**The plot hole:**

How come Valentine doesn't know about this crucial turn of events? As the treacherous head of the spy agency whose agents are trying to stop Valentine, Chester King should warrant very close surveillance. Someone on Valentine's team should've heard what went down through the implant, and maybe even realized when Eggsy took it out of Chester's dead body. But Valentine had no idea, and Eggsy was able to use the Chester King identity to stroll into the mountain bunker uncontested, while Merlin was able to hack into the implant to explode heads into fireworks. For a man of Valentine's meticulous planning and paranoia, this is an uncharacteristic lapse in security. So what gives?

The local college sends three professors: a structural engineer, a chemical engineer, and a literary critic.

The structural engineer suggests building a concrete dam to stem the river, and the mayor calls in a construction company to do the job.

A week later, the dam is completed, but in a few days the river’s current becomes more intense, and the dam crumbles.

Next, the chemical engineer suggests adding a gelatin solution to the river, to solidify the whole thing.

The mayor calls in a favor with a multinational chemical company, and they deliver a half ton of customized gelatinizing solution.

They add it to the river near the source, and the whole river turns to gelatin.

But a few days later, the current of the river becomes even stronger, and the water pressure at the source starts to break the gelatin apart

Then, out of nowhere, an awful thunderstorm appears over the town. the heavy rain starts to make the river flood.

In a last ditch attempt, the literary critic steps up to the river bank.
He coughs softly, purses his lips, takes a momentary glance at his fingernails, and says “I suppose this river is… adequate.”

And suddenly the flooding stops.

The two other professors rush to the critic’s side and ask, “How the hell did you stop the river from flooding?”

And the critic replies, “Simple. I dammed it with faint praise.”",Jokes,How to dam a river,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4zhgqy/how_to_dam_a_river/

To transport Harry from Privet Drive to the Burrow, Mad-Eye Moody made a bunch of people take Polyjuice Potion made with hair that Hermione took from Harry's head right in front of everybody, creating multiple Harry's.

Later on, after they've been ambushed by Death Eaters and it's apparent that someone leaked their plan, Lupin reacts by shoving Harry against the wall and making him answer a question to prove that he's the real Harry Potter.

*[\(""What creature sat in the corner the first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts?""\)](http://www.homeofthenutty.com/harrypotter/screencaps/albums/DHPart1/HPDH1-0678.jpg)*

**My question: Why does Lupin think it's even possible that this Harry is an impostor?** Several people drank Polyjuice Potion made with his hair and they all turned into Harry Potter. Does this mean that if a person is wearing a fake body and someone else makes a potion from *that* body, the potion will still work (that is, copy the fake body for the drinkers)? Or are we just supposed to handwave this away as Lupin being emotional and not thinking too clearly?",harrypotter,A question about Polyjuice Potion and a scene in Deathly Hallows 1,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4xvwbt/a_question_about_polyjuice_potion_and_a_scene_in/

I have a cellist music student in this story I'm writing (well, researching to write). Can you tell me what kind of chamber music ensemble it would be impressive to put him in? Where the cellist would be the star, in a manner of speaking. I've googled ensembles with cellos in them, but I can't parse which ones have more prestige for the cellist, if I may say that. The setting is a music school, by the way, if that matters. A little help?

I hope I'm not out of line here. I'm writing a story about a freshman in a fictional music school (which happens to be part of a bigger university) whose primary instrument is violin. It's still in the research stages, and the problem is I don't really know what midterms are like, or finals, for both the fall and spring semesters. I'm combing through all kinds of websites right now, but I thought I might get better answers from people who've actually gone through them rather than the short descriptions in curriculum pages. **I'm most interested in any performance requirements, how it all goes down, who would be watching, and what are some typical compositions that might be assigned at this level**--that kinda thing. I know a lot of this would depend on the school, but if anyone (even if your primary instrument isn't violin) would like to share their personal experiences or knowledge, that would really, really help me out.

Thanks so much in advance, you guys.

Send someone to jump in, find It, then pull him back with the rope around his waist. A rope and a pulley, guys. It's not rocket science.

For that matter, how come It never tried to get back on its own? Portals have been regularly opening all over that planet for thousands of years, determined by the alignment of the ~~moons~~ stars. Sure, It may not have the skill or gadgets to predict when/where it will happen, but it occurs at least once every few months*. After millenia, how hard could it be for It to chance across one portal and just...jump in? I feel like It is fully capable of dealing with whatever's waiting Earth-side.

About 20 years ago when I was a kid, my dad came home with a dirty white piece of rock about as big as a strawberry that he kept inside a jar full of water. Whenever we took it out of the jar, it would spark and emit tendrils of smoke. (I talked about it to my dad last night and he said he once saw it bursting into actual flame.) My parents and my siblings all remember it, but we have no clue what it was, and we lost it during a move a long time ago. My father says he got it from my uncle who lives by the sea, who in turn got it from a diver who found that rock/coral/whatever from under the ocean.

For the record, it wasn't a talisman or anything--we just treated it like a piece of curiosity that we played around with occasionally. My family isn't superstitious, but even if we were, there's no lore or beliefs regarding a self-igniting rock in my community anyway. The thing was found in the Philippines, if that matters.
