2,I sent a new 9550 in to Dell for repairs twice (the on-site technician couldn't replace the keyboard the first time and the second time I didn't even bother with on-site) and twice I got it back in worse shape than when I sent it out. ,2016-04-15 16:24:10+00:00,d245bev,1,t3_4ex77t,3660,Dell

Why is a separate partition for data important? Just for organization? If the partitions are on the same disk does it perform any better?",2016-04-14 02:27:51+00:00,d222krr,2,t1_d21v0tr,10764,Dell

13,"Steve Alten (or his PR) ran an embarrassingly bad and obvious campaign to spam Amazon with 5-star reviews for his book Phobos a few years ago. The book was garbage, I know because I read it. It was so bad I became really curious why it had so many 5-star reviews.

13 of the 17 5-star reviews (at the time I took the notes below) fit a profile. The reviewer had only reviewed ""Phobos"" or had multiple glowing Steve Alten reviews. 6 of the reviews were clustered on the same date. One was posted by Alten's Amazon account, (since deleted) but he didn't identify himself as the author in the body of the review.

Many reviews specifically mention Alten awkwardly by name, and/or his other works. The language is otherwise questionably enthusiastic. The phrase ""does not disappoint"" comes up 3 times, ""keeps you on the edge"" twice, Alten has ""done it again"" twice. Variations of ""worth the wait"" come up 3 times (this is the final book of a trilogy.) Two reviews compare him to Michael Crichton.

He's garbage for doing it and I'll never pick up anything of his again.
