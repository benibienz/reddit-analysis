5,"Riot are making themselves look so bad in this fiesta. That's not to say they didn't look bad before. It feels like they're a corporate monopoly strangling the advancement of league as a spectator sport so that they can make all the money off of it. Pro league of legends would be leaps and bounds ahead of what it is now of it had stayed out of the control of riot. It would be fucking lit to say the least. I could just imagine it with how much money would be going into it from sponsors and investors. Sad thing to see really, hope something changes soon.

33,"Usually the recommended build paths are fine. And since you are at a really low level I would suggest focusing on your mechanics and general understanding of the game more than your items. But every game is different when it comes to items, it's all about what the other team has as damage threats and countering they're builds. Good idea is to go on a build website like champion.gg, probuilds, or lolking and look at what people build in certain situations. Knowing what to build will just come in time and practicing the game though and then it will be second nature. ",2016-02-08 18:28:30+00:00,czsgo3a,2,t1_czsetto,2542,leagueoflegends
