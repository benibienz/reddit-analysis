Elizabeth is a young woman who's locked in a tower, except the magic spell behind her imprisonment is in the tower itself.

Oh, and her biological father turns out to be her adopted father from a different timeline.

37,"&gt;If they'd released that film into theaters I think people would be more excited about it.

Isn't the Ultimate Edition, like, 4 hours long? Does anyone really want to spend that much time on a single movie in the theater?

The thing about The Dark Knight trilogy is that it had the same problem as The Force Awakens. The minimum standard set for The Force Awakens was that it had to be better than the prequel trilogy, and I would argue that it went beyond that and turned out to be really good in spite of the expectations placed upon it. Similarly, the minimum standard set for the Dark Knight trilogy was that it had to be better than ""Batman &amp; Robin,"" and it more than delivered.

But, with the DCEU, its first mistake was the decision to start it in the same continuity as ""Man of Steel,"" creating the added burden of having to address the controversy around the ending of a movie that's otherwise, at worst, just OK.

By far, its biggest sin encompasses ""BvS,"" ""Suicide Squad,"" and ""The Killing Joke"": taking an idea for a movie that should be awesome, and ultimately fumbling it. ""BvS"" was based, in part, on ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" a much-beloved storyline. ""The Killing Joke"" was even worse - it was an adaptation of a much-beloved storyline and featured voice actors from the much-beloved animated series (including, but not limited to, Mark fucking Hamill), but they still managed to fumble it.",2016-11-03 12:58:26+00:00,d9jvo3d,3.0,t1_d9ju82n,2781.0,fixingmovies

And I can understand that Lorde herself isn't too proud of the song, as evidenced by the following quote:

*(BTW, that is an oddly specific type of phone to use in that example)*

226,"&gt;I don't think autists or their behaviors should ever be considered normative. Their behavior is just an indicator of an underlying disease that should be fixed.

There's no way that doesn't come across as being reminiscent of the Nazis. I don't think you are one, and I certainly hope you're not one, but in my experience, that way of thinking comes from not fully understanding the condition in question.

It has been suggested that people with autism don't isolate themselves from the world because they can't understand it. They actually do understand it, so much so that it simply overwhelms them. For example, when I watched ""Airplane"" for the first time in my late teens, and got to the part where the flight attendant plays guitar and accidentally knocks into the bedridden woman's IV tubes, I didn't think to laugh. My reaction was ""Holy shit, can someone check to see if that woman is OK?""

I'm an ""autist"" myself, you see. I was tested inaccurately at the age of 2, and my parents were told that I would essentially grow up to become Dustin Hoffman's character in ""Rain Man."" Mind you, the doctor who diagnosed me wasn't a bad person; I actually reconnected with him around the time I graduated high school. The resources he had at his disposal were just not as effective as they should have been. But as time went on, more was learned about the condition, and it's seen less as being ""broken"" and more as something that can be managed.

So, to clarify, you actually think that ""autists"" are broken beyond the point of becoming productive members of society?",2016-08-14 04:51:03+00:00,d6gqr0k,1.0,t3_4xkd29,36744.0,changemyview

267,"I have, in fact, heard of the Bechdel test - a movie passes if two named female characters talk to each other about something other than men. One of the characters in the original comic says the last movie she saw according to those standards was ""Aliens,"" because two named female characters talk about a Xenomorph, which is effectively genderless. However, in the original comic, there's no insistence that everyone has to hold movies to those standards, nor is there any suggestion that movies which don't meet those standards can't still be good (e.g. The Godfather, Jaws, The Dark Knight).

617,"When the ""Magnets"" track came out, the only reaction I had resembling a complaint had less to do with her discussing ""adult"" topics (because apparently society is still paranoid about female sexuality) and more to do with how it differed from her previous work. Nothing inherently wrong with that in general, but in Lorde's case, her appeal stemmed from her being a non-conforming underdog type who made relatable songs about being a teenager. There's a reason she was called the ""anti-Miley': whereas pop stars like Miley were upfront about their sexuality, Lorde was more subtle. Also, as others have pointed out, Lorde was 16 when she started making it big, so the ""upfront"" approach wouldn't have worked out quite as well. Not that it would've stopped anyone; I went to see a Lorde show once, and a guy behind me shouted, ""She's 18"" (even though she was a few months away from turning 18 at the time).

644,"I loved the show during its first 3 iterations, but considering the direction that it's taken since Omniverse, I will feel almost nothing as I respond to this post.

A while ago I uploaded a Ben 10-based meme to Cheezburger.com, which was a freeze frame of Gwen looking skeptical coupled with a caption that basically read, ""Oh, you think Ben 10 is a stupid show? Tell me again how Jersey Shore is better.""

When people commented, the general reaction was essentially, ""Ben 10 is, in fact, a stupid show.""

Now it might just be that I felt instinctively defensive about my opinions and felt upset when someone disagreed with them, but keep in mind, this is a website with sections dedicated to My Little Pony, Doctor Who, and Pokemon (among other franchises), so I thought some of the people on the website might feel similarly or at least understand my perspective.

Point is, I totally agree that Ben 10 is a great show, but that's still an opinion, and won't matter much unless enough people share that opinion.

Also, the problem with your analogy about The Last Airbender is that the movie was based on a source material that people loved, which made it even worse because it was essentially that fandom's version of the Star Wars prequels. There were 2 live action movies based on the Ben 10 franchise, but they were made-for-TV movies, so it's not exactly the same.",2015-08-29 22:34:46+00:00,cuk5gke,1.0,t3_3fdxjz,2473639.0,Ben10

646,"I'm gonna focus more on that theory you had.
Asperger's Syndrome is a form of autism. You may have heard the term, ""autism spectrum,"" and there's a reason why it's called a ""spectrum."" Every case of autism will exhibit varying symptoms, and some cases will be more (for lack of a better term) severe than others. In my case, I'm what's called ""high-functioning,"" so while I do have trouble reading social cues, my diagnosis isn't as severe. If you met me, and didn't know anything about me (including my diagnosis), you probably wouldn't be able to tell that I was on the autism spectrum.
That being said, I can't validate your theory for a very important reason. Keep in mind that not everyone with autism will get an accurate diagnosis. Either people with autism get diagnosed with something else, people with something else get diagnosed with autism, or people with autism don't get diagnosed at all.

And treating symptoms of autism, like many other conditions, involves medication, so taking the wrong medication entails very serious consequences. Any statistics on autism (like how many people have it) should be taken with a grain of salt, so I can't say for sure whether or not your theory is correct.",2015-08-23 13:12:47+00:00,cucrmp2,4.0,t1_cucpf5i,8289.0,IAmA
