There's a rebel base responsible for distributing supplies among the rebel side, and the player serves as the head of the base.

In addition to keeping track of supplies, employees and the like, the player faces the added pressure of ensuring that the base remains ""off the grid"" as much as possible.

Also, there are files and other pieces of information scattered around the base, and the player can explore and search for said information.

While it's optional, exploration is strongly encouraged because, whenever the player is presented with a decision, the possible answers will be different depending on what and how much information the player had uncovered through exploration.

Not only is it appropriately challenging, but it encourages the player to make decisions on the best and most amount of information possible.",gameideas,Base management game with exploration-dependent decision-making,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/5e02m5/base_management_game_with_explorationdependent/

I didn't really get all the hate towards her after she rejected Ben in the original series.

First of all, Ben and Kai were both 10 years old, and for every one good decision Ben ever made at that age, he made 5 or 6 bad ones.

Secondly, that was the only episode in the entire series where she had any speaking lines, so it seemed harsh to hold on to any resentment towards her when the show had clearly moved on.

Alien Force and Ultimate Alien came and went, and I had tuned out after the Ultimate Alien finale. So when Omniverse was announced and the first set of footage was released, I could not have cared less. Then I heard the show was bringing back Kai (and her original voice actress), and I thought, ""Okay, the previous two series never made any mention of her, so she has a lot of potential to be reintroduced as a cool character.""

Sadly, that was not the case.

The show made her into a Lara Croft clone, right down to her f@!#ing clothes, but that could've been overlooked if she was well-written enough. The problem wasn't that she was badly written; rather, she just felt like a waste of potential. She would've made the whole show worth watching for me if she was allowed to do more than just be Lara Croft.

Here's what I mean. You know how Lara Croft is essentially Indiana Jones as a British woman? Omniverse Kai Green is essentially Indiana Jones as a Native American woman.

She goes looking for lost treasures and she works in a museum. She might as well just rip off a scene from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" while she's at it.

Oh wait, she did.

In that ""Secret of Dos Santos"" episode, there's a metallic thing on a stone platform so vaguely defined I don't even remember what it looks like, let alone what it was supposed to do. Kai walks up to it and takes out a bag of sand, conveniently glossing over how she actually got that bag in the first place. At least in ""Raiders,"" we saw Indy fill the bag with sand before going into that cave with Satipo. Then while she's getting the bag ready, Rook is behind her, rubbing his fingers like Dr. Octopus did in ""Raiders.""

Like I said, that could've been forgiven if the show let her do more than just rip off Indiana Jones and hook up with Ben faster than it took her reject him the first time around.

That's another thing. The show was apparently so quick to hook them up, they forgot how to make any part of it remotely sensible. You know that guy in ""Fight at the Museum"" who came from the future to tell Ben and Kai that they belong together? Why didn't he think to warn Kai that someone was gonna try and rob the museum? And at the end of the episode, when Kai thinks the thieves got away with an artifact, instead of telling her that he still has it, why did the future guy have her wait, what, 20 years before she could find it again?

In short, if Kai's appearance in Omniverse is any indication, the rest of the show (and the series as it currently stands) is full of wasted opportunities that don't get fully realized because they're inexplicably set aside for some dumb plot points.

However, I worry that, in recent years, a lot more emphasis has been put into making strong female characters for its own sake. Like, people will promote a movie and say the female lead is a strong female character, but there's little in the actual movie to prove that (a ""Faux Action Girl,"" to borrow from [TV Tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl)).

Let's say a female character gets captured. If a movie has a female character who insists she isn't a damsel in distress, but doesn't seem to bother trying to escape on her own when she gets captured, the movie's basically saying, ""Hey, we heard you people like strong, independent ladies. So we got one for you right here! Are we cool now?"" That's what I hear anyway; I personally haven't seen ""The Legend of Tarzan.""

But if the character is already well-written and engaging enough, and the audience has already connected with her, then she shouldn't have to outright explain that she can take care of herself since the audience would already know she can. Say what you will about Rey from The Force Awakens or Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite (I know it's a video game - deal with it), but at least they make the effort to escape capture, and the audience is happy when they do.

So, again, if a character's already engaging and well-written, then it shouldn't matter whether they're a strong female character or not.

They have the actors help them defeat this evil alien named Sarris and blah blah blah.

The movie has a lot of comedy elements, as it's meant to be a parody of Star Trek (and, going by the plot, ""Seven Samurai""), but it does a pretty good job of walking the line between parody and playing it straight. Although nothing less could be expected from a movie that was said to have been originally developed by Harold Ramis.

I remember having seen ""Galaxy Quest"" when I was much younger, but I only remember a few parts of it towards the end of the movie.

And the latter has said that complaining about political correctness isn't a viable substitute for taking action against real-life problems. I disagree, however, on the point that society has become too politically correct, as if it was bad that we've been changing our attitudes towards certain derogatory terms as society has grown more and more accepting of certain demographics.

What's the word?

It's on the tip of my tongue; it's a synonym for experiencing something.

Anyway, he sees a murder in a train station bathroom.

When Harrison Ford's character, a cop, finds out that one of his colleagues had a hand in the murder, he goes into hiding at the Amish kid's house with the kid's recently widowed mother.

Aside from the admittedly nit-picky question of how accurately the movie portrayed Amish people (specifically, whether they can use locks), the main gripe I had was with the [ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdW1BlDtcyU).

In a word, ""anticlimactic.""

In two words, ""very anticlimactic.""

Harrison Ford just shouts, ""It's over,"" and the guy just lets him take the gun out of his hand.

Sure, he couldn't just shoot him since there was a crowd of witnesses - oh, THAT was the word!

The movie could've ended on a more exciting note, is what I'm saying.

We're told that Private Joker wrote for his school newspaper, which is why he's assigned as a 4212 (military journalist). So he's not prepared for combat, nor is he the best at training either, but he's good enough. Over the course of the movie, especially during the second half, we see Private Joker become more and more aware of the reality of the war, and thus take the whole thing more and more seriously. Also, to add some additional personal conflict, he's a pacifist, so he's struggling to balance his views with the war around him.

Here are some examples of how it would play out:

- In the scene where Sergeant Hartman asks Private Joker whether he believes in the Virgin Mary, he would instead ask whether he believes the Vietnam War is a just war. Private Joker would say ""no"" and Hartman would call him a ""commie hippie,"" or something along those lines.

- Being made Private Pyle's personal instructor is, in theory at least, meant to have Private Joker connect with Private Pyle. In the scene where everyone attacks Private Pyle during the night, Private Joker hesitates to hit him at first. This is partly due to them having become close friends, and partly due to Joker's pacifist views, but ultimately he relents (a.k.a. fore . . . wait for it . . .)

- In the scene where Private Pyle shoots Sergeant Hartman before shooting himself, it's very emotionally distressing and intense for Private Joker, who watched the whole thing happen right before him. The audience would be seeing the training from Private Joker's perspective, which means seeing him connect with Private Pyle. So when the bathroom scene plays out, we're basically Private Joker, because we've seen Private Joker (the protagonist, i.e. the character with whom the audience is supposed to relate the most) connect with him up to that moment.

- At the end of the movie, when Private Joker is deciding whether or not to shoot the sniper, he's already spent the entire movie coming to terms with the cognitive dissonance between his aforementioned pacifist views and the reality of the war around him (. . . shadowing). So the scene has a lot more weight to it.

But, just like the original BioShock, there are also some philosophical themes in the game, with one example that comes to mind.

You know the scene where Booker meets Elizabeth for the first time?

He falls through the ceiling, she starts throwing books at him, and when she finally calms down, what's the first thing she asks?

""Are you real?""

Kind of an odd question for her to ask.

Why would she think Booker isn't real? 

Doesn't she know what a human looks like?

Well, maybe not.

Remember, she's been locked in a tower like a Disney princess for 20 years, and the closest thing she's had to contact with the outside world (and other humans) is the Songbird and a whole lot of books.

I'm reminded of Plato's Allegory of the Cave, which you can see illustrated [here](http://stevewatson.info/courses/IntroductionToPhilosophy/slides/plato_knowledge/images/cave.jpg).

Basically, if a person spent his/her whole life watching shadows in a cave, they'd regard the shadows as real. But if that person were to leave the cave, they would be overwhelmed.

It should be noted that the person in the allegory is a prisoner, as they are chained by their neck and legs so they can't move or turn their head away from the shadow-projecting wall in front of them.

In the game, Elizabeth is that prisoner, which may explain why, upon meeting Booker for the first time, she asks, ""Are you real?""

And on the subject of Ancient Greek references (of which the BioShock games have plenty), what book is Elizabeth holding when Booker first meets her?

The Odyssey, a story of a war veteran going on an epic journey to reunite with his family after being separated for 20 years.

Similarly, Booker's narrative in the game is that (SPOILERS) he's a war veteran going on an epic journey to reunite with his family after being separated for 20 years.

That's one of the game's many foreshadowings of the big twist, but the connection goes a little deeper.

In ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" Luke gets his right hand cut off by the guy who turns out to be his father, but gets it replaced with a mechanical prosthetic.

While Elizabeth didn't get her whole right hand cut off, she did have her pinky finger severed when Booker was trying to keep Comstock from taking her (so the thimble serves the same purpose as Luke's mechanical prosthetic).

Since Booker and Comstock are revealed to be the same guy in different timelines, he's responsible for her severed finger, in much the same way that Darth Vader is responsible for Luke's severed hand.

As the title suggests, in ""The Dark Knight,"" The Joker knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman.

So why doesn't The Joker just use one of the videos he made to reveal Batman's identity, instead of challenging Batman to ""take off his mask and turn himself in""?

Well, in the interrogation scene, he tells Batman, ""I don't want to kill you. What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers? No, you complete me.""

As you know, in comics, the heroes tend to keep their identities secret for the well-being of their loved ones.

If/when their enemies found out the heroes' secret identities, the first thing they would do is target the heroes' loved ones.

If The Joker publicly revealed that Bruce Wayne was Batman, then he'd probably have to stop being Batman for the well-being of him and his loved ones.

That's why The Joker released a video where he says, ""For every day that you don't reveal your identity, I'll kill another person.""

Batman's mission is to protect Gotham, so The Joker figures that Batman would go to any lengths, even revealing his own secret identity, to ensure the safety of the city's inhabitants - at least in theory.

In practice, he's lucky he's rich enough to pay for all the property damages he caused throughout the movie.

But Batman isn't gonna just give up his secret identity if he thinks there's another way to save the people that The Joker is targeting.

So The Joker is essentially playing with Batman, which makes Batman's job all the more difficult since he spends the entire movie wondering when he can stop being Batman and let someone else worry about protecting the city.

Also, Batman works closely with the police department in the movie, which is why The Joker warns him that, no matter how much he'd like to be, he's not a cop that actually works with the police department.

In the interrogation scene, The Joker tells him, ""To them, you're just a freak, like me. They need you right now, but when they don't, they'll cast you out like a leper. You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these 'civilized' people will eat each other. See, I'm not a monster; I'm just ahead of the curve.""

And remember how Harvey Dent put together a press conference and told everyone he was Batman, after Batman saved Rachel when The Joker threw her out the window?

In the interrogation scene, The Joker says, ""You know, for a while there, I thought you really were Dent. The way you threw yourself after her.""

Obviously, Andrew Ryan was the game's analogue of Ayn Rand, and Rapture was the application of her objectivist philosophy on a mass scale.

In Ryan's speech at the beginning of the game, he calls Rapture a city where, among other things, ""the scientist would not be bound by petty morality.""

As an example of this, part of the game's big reveal is that (SPOILER ALERT) Jack, the protagonist, was Ryan's son, genetically modified by Fontaine Futuristics as an embryo to basically turn him into a sleeper agent that Fontaine could use to take down Ryan. (/SPOILER ALERT)

It's a sinister plan, sure, but how did Fontaine come up with that?

And not to suggest that scientific research isn't important in any way, but what made Ryan become so obsessed with it?

Well, recently, I was reading Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World.""

The book is set in a society with a permanently limited population, which is maintained, in part, by:

* Replacing natural reproduction with in-vitro fertilization

* Using psychological manipulation to discourage critical thought and individual action

The book was written in 1932, which, given that the game is set in 1960, means that people in the game would have been familiar with it.

Whether or not the book was written specifically to warn about the dangers of a society such as Rapture, perhaps Andrew Ryan's vision for Rapture drew more than a little inspiration from the book.

Heck, the book mentions speeding up a person's physical development, while Jack is said to be 4 years old, yet has the build of a grown man.

Sure, it seems like Ryan would have had issue with the part about discouraging individual action, but we've seen what he does to people who disagree with him.

If Fontaine also used the book as inspire for his agenda, then what we have is a case of Fontaine using Ryan's own philosophy against him.

The problem is that a lot of these porn parodies are shot from a 1st person perspective, much like the actual game.

In other words, just about every BioShock Infinite porn parody is straight-up incest.

Right now, the predominant complaint is over the particular style of animation, but I think something else should be considered.

The original series followed Ben as a 10-year-old (of course).

Alien Force and Ultimate Alien followed Ben as a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old, respectively.

In case you don't see what the problem is with a 5-year gap in between the original series and Alien Force, I'll explain.

Puberty starts, on average, around the age of 11.

Even if Ben, Gwen and Kevin had already gone through puberty by the end of Ultimate Alien, they're still teenagers.

You know how, in the first Sam Raimi-directed Spider Man movie, Peter Parker started out as a high school student, and then he was a college student in the second movie?

The idea behind the change, at least in my mind, was that it allowed the audience to see Peter Parker grow as a character, as opposed to the Spider Man reboot that figuratively pressed the reset button and moved Peter Parker back into high school.

Similarly, it would have been interesting (and arguably better) to see how Ben, Gwen and Kevin handle growing up and everything it entails.

I realize that these are more mature topics and wouldn't be especially welcomed in a program meant for younger demographics.

But Ben and Gwen are both 15 in Alien Force, while Kevin is 16.

All I'm saying is that the show ought to have been made so the age of the show's target audience reflected the age of the show's protagonists.

Cain is the oldest of Adam and Eve's two sons in the book of Genesis, chapter 4.

He spent him time farming, while his younger brother, Abel, was like many other Biblical figures (i.e. a shepherd).

Once, they each made an offering to God.

Cain presented the literal fruits of his labors, while Abel presented God with some lamb meat.

God (who apparently has a soft spot for younger brothers) liked Abel's offering better than Cain's.

Out of jealousy, Cain killed Abel.

God punished Cain by promising that ""when you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."" (Genesis 4:12)

Oddly enough, Cain worries that, while he's out wandering the Earth, someone might kill him.

So God gives him a mark of protection.

Now, for some speculation (and the theory in particular). 

Cain was a farmer, which means he probably had tools.

Perhaps he killed Abel with one of these tools, specifically one meant for cutting things.

But since he could no longer do anything as a farmer (what with the curse God gave him), he might have been given a new job that had to do with dead people (since he created the first dead person in the Bible).

Additionally, the Bible doesn't exactly say what the ""mark of Cain"" looks like, but perhaps Cain felt so guilty about what he did that he hid the mark under, say, a robe.

What I'm getting at is that Cain turned into [this](http://images.buycostumes.com/mgen/merchandiser/grim-reaper-deluxe-with-vinyl-hands-child-costume-bc-33886.jpg).",FanTheories,"The Fate Of Cain (a.k.a. the ""brother's keeper"" guy from Genesis)",https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3x5hhp/the_fate_of_cain_aka_the_brothers_keeper_guy_from/

If you use Possession on the vending machine, the two guys will scream and cower in fear.

The same thing happens later at the Worker Induction Center.

Keep in mind that no one else in the game up to this point reacted that way to your Possession vigor.

For example, when you use Possession on vending machines at the fair and raffle, no one screams and cowers in fear.

This reaction from the Finkton workers may provide insight on how the workers are being treated (which is to say, terribly).

Since Possession works like a mind control drug (even though it's advertised as what is essentially a date rape drug that's inexplicably sold on the open market), it suggests that Fink used Possession on disgruntled workers who sided with the Vox Populi, or were uncooperative in general.

Fink even talks over the loudspeakers throughout the level about how workers complain to him all the time.

And the audition Fink put up for Booker in the Good Time Club?

Perhaps the Possession vigor wasn't doing enough to placate the workers.

The show was terrific, needless to say.
However, there were 2 low points, although they had less to do with her and more with my dad, who drove me to the event.
Just so you know, he has the sense of humor of a frat boy who gets off on schadenfreude (in other words, the adult version of that kid who picked on you in grade school).

The first low point was he told me during her set that she had personally offered to be my ""first time.”
Her.
Tori Kelly.
A Christian woman who I'm presuming is saving herself for marriage, at least based on the line, ""I'd really like a soulmate/And God'll give him to me someday/And I know it'll be worth the wait.”
Sure, it’s clear that he was only picking on me, but still, that’s kind of a douche thing to say.

The second low point was after the show ended around 10 pm; there was a crowd of people (myself included) who waited outside the building by her tour bus to get pictures and autographs.
After waiting for about 15 minutes, my dad started telling me to hurry up so we could leave. I told him we'd leave if she didn't show up by 10:30. I had no way of knowing how long she would be (although she did say, “If I said I’m gonna make you wait/I don’t mean it, but I’m always late”), but while I didn't want to keep telling my dad to wait a few more minutes, I still wanted to get a picture with her. Unfortunately, after a handful of disheartening false alarms, she didn’t show up by 10:30, so we left.

To be clear, I don't blame her for any of that. I'd understand if she was taking so long because she was reapplying makeup or something.

Consider the season 5 episode of Omniverse, ""An American Benwolf In London.""

Neither Chadwick nor Ben can draw the Excalibur from the stone, but when the room flooded over, Kai grabbed onto it and was able to make it budge.

This could just be an example of what I call the ""pickle jar lid"" theory, where the combined efforts of Chadwick, Ben and the water eroding against the stone loosened the sword enough that Kai could move it.

It certainly makes more sense than the explanation for how a teenage Navajo girl would be the fated ruler of England.

Or does it?

See, according to Arthurian legend, the Excalibur was presented to Arthur by the Lady Of The Lake.

Descriptions of the Lady Of The Lake are vague, at best (if anyone bothers to describe her at all), but basically the theory centers around the idea that the Lady Of The Lake (SURPRISE!) was an alien.

She presumably spent most of her time underwater, so more likely than not, she wouldn't have been human.

So this female alien presented a powerful weapon to a human deemed worthy enough to yield it.

Sounds a lot like what Xylene did in the original series, I know, but here's the kick.

The show makes it clear that humans and aliens can interbreed, and the offspring of those pairings inherit certain traits from their alien parents.

Several of such offspring can be found in the Plumbers, so it wouldn't be a stretch then to say that it's possible Kai might also have alien heritage.

What I'm getting at is, Kai is descended from the same race of aliens as the Lady Of The Lake.

That explains why she would be able to yield the sword (especially in the future).

Also, consider that some of Kai's more notable appearances had something to do with water.

There's the scene in ""An American Benwolf In London,"" obviously.

But in the ""Benwolf"" episode from the original series, Kai is carried away by the flash flood, and then saved by Ben.

No, actually.
If the BioShock wiki is to be believed, Elizabeth was born 2 years after the baptism. That means she would've had to go back in time and kill her father before she was even conceived, which you'll notice is the premise of the grandfather paradox (or in this case, father paradox).
Even if all they ended up doing was just stopping the Comstock timeline from ever happening, it would still be a paradox.
Elizabeth got her powers from getting her finger caught in a tear while she was being sold to Comstock. If Comstock never existed, then she wouldn't have had her powers.
So either she ends all of Booker's possible timelines and creates a paradox, or just ends Comstock's timeline, which gets rid of her powers and creates a paradox.

You know how there's a Pokemon fan theory about Ash falling into a coma in the TV pilot?
This is like that, but with Ben 10.
In the pilot episode, Ben is on a camping ground during a summer trip with Max and Gwen.
While he's taking a walk, he sees what he initially thinks is a shooting star.
This is immediately after he wishes that he wouldn't have a boring summer, and in a way, it comes true.
The shooting star suddenly turns sharply towards Ben; fortunately, he manages to get out of the way before it can fall on him.
It turned out that the shooting star was a capsule containing the Omnitrix.
So the shooting star wasn't a ""light at the end of the tunnel.""
But what if it was?
I'm not saying Ben was killed by the impact, or even that the impact happened at all.
Instead, he tripped on something, or something fell on him, and he fell unconscious.
Here's my evidence (at least, for the original series):

1. Max and Gwen don't go looking for him immediately after the incident. Consider that, in the show, the object's impact was clearly loud and bright enough to have been noticed even though it was deep within the forest near their campsite. If Ben simply tripped or had something fall on him, then they wouldn't have been able to hear it or see it.

2. Despite the fact that the summer vacation lasts, at most, 3 months, Ben, Max, and Gwen are all wearing the same clothes throughout the series. This might normally be explained by the fact that cartoon characters are almost always seen wearing the same clothes because drawing new clothes on them for every episode would be even more time-consuming than it already is, but this explanation works just as well.

3. In ""A Perfect Day,"" the Forever Knights sedate Ben so they can take the Omnitrix off of him. While he's sedated, Ben is being made to think he's having a perfect day, suggesting that something like this can, in fact, happen.

4. Ben's a fan of comics and video games, and some of the aliens resemble characters in comics and video games that would've been familiar to Ben. For example, Heatblast seems to be Ben's version of Iron Man. Heatblast's face looks like an Iron Man mask, and Heatblast can shoot flames out of his hands in a way that looks like Iron Man shooting lasers out of his hands.

5. Max and Gwen seem to be affected as well. Remember that Ben wishes that the summer he would spend with them wouldn’t be boring, meaning that Ben finds Max and Gwen boring. What better way to account for that than for Ben’s coma dream to make them more interesting to help him fight bad guys? Max, as it turned out, was in an intergalactic law-enforcement organization called the Plumbers (instead of just being a plumber). As a Plumber, his interactions with other alien species would have familiarized him to different tastes in food, and his work with alien technology provided him with the ability to completely trick out the Rust Bucket. Not to mention, when the Rust Bucket gets destroyed, it somehow manages to return to its normal condition by the next episode. The bookish Gwen, meanwhile, would be a martial arts expert who studies and practices magic.

6. Why else would Ben have to fight the same bad guys over and over again unless Ben wanted to keep fighting them in his coma dream?
