805,"Christianity explicitly declares that no food is forbidden twice.

Mark 7

14 And he called the people to him again and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand: 15 There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.” 17 And when he had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable. 18 And he said to them, “Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, 19 since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled?” (Thus he declared all foods clean.) 20 And he said, “What comes out of a person is what defiles him. 21 For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, 22 coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. 23 All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.”

Acts 10

9 The next day, as they went on their journey and drew near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about 5 the sixth hour. 10 Then he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance 11 and saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth. 12 In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. 13 And a voice came to him, ""Rise, Peter; kill and eat."" 14 But Peter said, ""Not so, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean."" 15 And a voice spoke to him again the second time, ""What God has 6 cleansed you must not call common."" 16 This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.",2016-10-28 13:06:10+00:00,d9bckse,9.0,t1_d9bbco0,2356.0,ukpolitics

1894,"Final Fantasy X's battle system lends itself to a style of boss battle where you have to be as efficient with your turns as possible before the enemy acts, such as maximising your damage output or raising your defences. Half-arsing it will get you crushed.

Final Fantasy X-2 is incredibly fast-paced ATB. If you hesitate, you die. There's a reason why it has a built-in turbo button function.

Final Fantasy XII is very tactical. The Gambit system allows you to automate basic actions like attacking, buffing and healing. While the gambits do the donkey work you have to watch out for the bosses actions to subvert your gambit scheme, like throwing a crap-ton of status effects.

Final Fantasy XIII is a blend of X-2's pace with XII's tactics. This time round, you receive what are essentially six pre-assigned gambit schemes called ""paradigms"". You create up to six combinations of three paradigms which you can switch between at will during battle. Like in X-2, you have to be really on the ball and stay one step ahead of the boss. XIII-2 gives some improvements and changes to the system while in the third game, Lightning Returns, there is only one playable character and there is no automation. Lightning Returns also has the most visually spectacular final boss fight I have ever seen and its very challenging.",2016-09-30 23:29:09+00:00,d88ym5y,1.0,t3_557u01,36923.0,Gaming4Gamers

I'm more worried about them inadvertently having someone declare war on them, like Russia.

&gt; The UN is inherently toothless/ impotent due to the nature of the permanent security council members.

The UN is so much more than the Security Council - it's one branch out of five. I'd say the Security Council helps reduce a lot of conflict by forcing the world's major powers into negotiating.

&gt; why a 'united states of europe' is particularly different from a more modern USA

First of all, there are far too many cultures to smash together. The USA was mainly formed through the merger of three major spheres -  the Thirteen Colonies, the Louisiana Purchase and seizing some of Spain's colonies. In addition to that, the process involved imperialism in all but name, from the subjugation of the native population already crippled by a plague to overthrowing a Pacific kingdom.

Not being sure about leaving the EU or not being too bothered about leaving the EU, or being complacent about leaving the EU, are not at all indicators of supporting the most extreme changes that alter the fundamentals of Britain's place in the world and involve the most possible risk.

They. Didn't. Say. Anything.

&gt; 37% of the electorate voted for ""Leave the EU"" and 34% voted to ""Remain in the EU"" .

You should see what the percentage of the electorate votes for the winning party in GEs.

&gt; Anyone who suggests that the ""democratic"" outcome is full Brexit, leaving the single market, is totally off their fucking rocker, and is a complete snake who doesn't give the vaguest shit about any kind of democracy beyond imposing their own will.

3834,"Galatians 5

For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.

2 Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. 3 I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law. 4 You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. 5 For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness. 6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.

7 You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? 8 This persuasion is not from him who calls you. 9 A little leaven leavens the whole lump. 10 I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine, and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is. 11 But if I, brothers, still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offence of the cross has been removed. 12 I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!

13 For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. 14 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.” 15 But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.

16 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. 17 For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 19 Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, 20 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, 21 envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. 24 And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. 26 Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.",2016-08-16 13:56:19+00:00,d6jodw9,3.0,t1_d6jlaxs,5571.0,ukpolitics

4066,"Bible literalism has never been the default, *even within the Bible itself*.

&gt; Galatians 4:21-31 English Standard Version (ESV)

&gt;21 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law? 22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. 23 But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise. 24 Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. 25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. 26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. 27 For it is written,

&gt;“Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear;
    break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor!
For the children of the desolate one will be more
    than those of the one who has a husband.”

&gt;28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. 29 But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. 30 But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.” 31 So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.

Cecilia Malmström, Trade Commissioner

Our head of state has only ceremonial powers and is seen as our cultural, not political, leader. The monarchy has a mainly diplomatic role which is embraced around the world.

The House of Lords (the name is just a historical relic nowadays) is only a reviewing body and cannot pass legislation by itself. The Commons have the ability to bypass them extreme circumstances. There are only 26 Lords Spiritual out of currently 800 - less influence than the UK has the EU Parliament.

Single member constituencies ensure complete responsibility for MPs. If there were more than one, they would inevitably try to ""delegate"" each other on matters they don't like. We had a referendum on introducing Alternative Vote, which would have required candidates to achieve a majority, not just a plurality. It was rejected by over 60% of the population because of dirty campaigning.

As for your KINGDOM complaint, [look at how many monarchies there are in Europe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchies_in_Europe) and find them in [this ranking of national corruption](http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015/results).",2016-06-22 19:08:39+00:00,d4jring,7.0,t1_d4jq1k8,1822.0,ukpolitics

6628,"Midnight rant warning.

I had huge computer issues which delayed my simulations and limited the time I could run them. This delayed the writing of my dissertation and deadline by about a month.

My supervisor explicitly stated that I should write my dissertation as if I were to submit it to a journal and that he didn't want to be directly involved in its writing as he would be marking it.

Due to the frankly terrible results, I had relatively little to discuss and I struggled to write more than 6000 words. I have a concise way of writing so I expected my dissertation to be on the short side and soldiered on. I felt like I had written as much as I could and managed to wring out some inspiration from my supervisor.

My supervisor said to get a fellow student to be a beta reader. There were only four of us as the department was brand new and two had already finished their dissertation. The one available student also had technical difficulties and had his deadline extended like mine. The issue? He's dyslexic. Nobody else had the specialist knowledge to give good feedback.

In what in hindsight was probably a massive moment of overconfidence, I printed two copies of my dissertation and got them bound (£17 in total) and gave one to my supervisor.

Hours later he calls me to give quick feedback:

1) He didn't have much of a problem with how short it was and said it is probably worthy of being published (though we had no intention of doing so)

2) This really got my goat - he said that I had to write it to appeal to a wider audience and not assume any specialist knowledge. I've read countless papers during the literature review, I got well acquainted to their writing style and tried to emulate it on his prior advice. I wrote with the intention of making a highly focused research article, not a more general review paper.

I have two days to take in his advice in addition to creating and printing an A0 (841 x 1189 mm to those not familiar) poster summarising my project.

Nuclear power stations are expensive to build but the energy it produces is really cheap and even with decommission costs incorporated in the strike price it's around the same as mature renewable tech. We have the largest stockpile of plutonium in the world and we're doing nothing with it; it can't be trusted in private hands and no other country will accept it.

I hate the focus on wind energy; it's stupidly intermittent. Extensive wind power isn't going to work unless a national energy storage system is created.

Hydropower is only really viable in the Highlands where hardly anyone lives.

Solar energy... go have a look at how much sunlight we get. It's only going to be of residential use. I do love the technology itself; I took a course in organic electronics for solar cells.

7919,"That was actually Powell quoting a constituent.

Powell said that the man told him: ""If I had the money to go, I wouldn't stay in this country… I have three children, all of them been through grammar school and two of them married now, with family. I shan't be satisfied till I have seen them all settled overseas."" The man finished by saying to Powell: ""In this country in 15 or 20 years' time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man.""

This is what Powell says after quoting the man:

&gt; Here is a decent, ordinary fellow Englishman, who in broad daylight in my own town says to me, his Member of Parliament, that the country will not be worth living in for his children. I simply do not have the right to shrug my shoulders and think about something else. What he is saying, thousands and hundreds of thousands are saying and thinking – not throughout Great Britain, perhaps, but in the areas that are already undergoing the total transformation to which there is no parallel in a thousand years of English history. We must be mad, literally mad, as a nation to be permitting the annual inflow of some 50,000 dependents, who are for the most part the material of the future growth of the immigrant descended population. It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre. So insane are we that we actually permit unmarried persons to immigrate for the purpose of founding a family with spouses and fiancées whom they have never seen.",2016-04-24 12:16:22+00:00,d2f9tca,11.0,t1_d2f9j7g,977.0,ukpolitics
7920,"During an interview with the Birmingham post, a fortnight after his Rivers of Blood speech, he was asked whether or not he was a racialist, he replied ""What I would take racialist to mean is a person who believes in the inherent inferiority of one race of mankind to another, and who acts and speaks in that belief. So the answer to your question of whether I am a racialist is 'No' - unless perhaps, in reverse. I regard many of the peoples in India as being superior in many respects - intellectually for example, and in other respects - to Europeans. Perhaps that is over-reacting."" - Shepherd 1994, p. 364

In a television confrontation with David Frost in 1969, Frost asked him if he was a racialist, Powell replied that ""first of all one must define the word and that if by being conscious of differences between nations some of which coincide with race then we are all racialists, I would have thought, but if by being a racialist means despising someone of a different race or believing one race is superior to another race then the answer is emphatically no."" - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdr96F5PfMg)

The Labour Party MP Michael Foot remarked to a reporter that it was ""tragic"" that this ""outstanding personality"" had been widely misunderstood as predicting actual bloodshed in Britain, when in fact he had used the Aeneid quotation merely to communicate his own sense of foreboding.

Thirty years after the speech, Edward Heath said that Powell's remarks on the ""economic burden of immigration"" had been ""not without prescience.""

In an interview for Today shortly after her departure from office in 1991, Margaret Thatcher said that Powell had ""made a valid argument, if in sometimes regrettable terms."" - Christopher Sandford: ""To See and to Speak"" in Chronicles: A Magazine of American Culture, June 2012",2016-04-24 12:02:29+00:00,d2f9kpl,15.0,t1_d2f943s,1653.0,ukpolitics

8393,"&gt; Nope, he's saying that because a fundamental tenet of The Red Pill is that you, not the women who reject you, are responsible for you being rejected. Blaming women gets you nowhere. Only changing yourself works.

You can change yourself all you like but ultimately you can't force people to like you.

&gt; Having sex with people you want to have sex with is hardly a dark agenda.

Being able to control our base instincts is what separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. There's more to life than spreading your seed.

&gt; Why?

A libertarian capitalist probably wouldn't understand.

&gt; Of course not, but it helps if you're in shape.

That doesn't necessarily mean ""be the ripped jock"". Many women hate jocks. What most women admire is confidence and self-esteem; fitness is just one of many contributors. Don't be a braggart, though.

&gt; Friends is not what TRP is about.

Romance without friendship is just lust.

&gt; They are the only competition that matters.

Rather funny coming from a capitalist.

&gt; Yes there is and it is simple; be attractive.

8397,"&gt; Nobody blames women or hates them for the way they are or the way the dating game is, or the way the marriage system/family court is set up to destroy men.

You're just saying this because you assumed nobody would go to see it for what it is; a congregation of insecure men who see women as nothing more than a goal in life.

&gt; It's about finances, fitness and health, social skills, controlling your career, your future, and self-improvement in general.

That's what friends, family and professional advisors are for, not strangers with a dark agenda.

&gt; It's really not hard. If you want to get the girls, go to the gym and put on muscle and take care of your body. Be the ripped jock who gets laid all the time in the teen movies, not the weedy nerd who looks on in jealousy. If you want to command respect from fellow men, be taller and stronger than they are so they're scared to fuck with you.

It's this ""alpha male"" mentality that pisses us off. You don't have to be a ripped macho man to get a girlfriend. I could be well described as a ""weedy nerd"" but I still manage to make friends with the ladies. Relationships are not a competition.

South Korea and Mexico don't have to pay to trade with the EU. The EFTA make payments because their agreements are beyond just free trade.

As for exports, manufacturers will only have to abide by EU regulations if they sell to the EU, not anywhere else in the world.

NATO is independent of the EU and it would be in everyone's interests to cooperate and share intelligence when necessary regardless of our memberships, especially with recent events.

The Bible is a collection of diverse texts, written by many people, covering thousands of years. It never claims to be the literal word of God but quotes him frequently, neither does it always claim to be infallible except for prophecies IIRC.

The Quran is a singular text that emulates the Bible's structure, supposedly dictated to an illiterate warlord by an angel. It claims to be the literal word of God and infallible. Would you agree that such claims demand a higher standard of trust and evidence?",2016-04-04 00:53:54+00:00,d1oqm78,3.0,t1_d1opc46,1935.0,AskReddit

9204,"&gt; The time based dependence, like I've said, makes zero impact on gameplay in 4-9 except for the fact where if you refuse to act or act incredibly slowly, which is even harder with cursor memory, you're turn can be skipped, it's still a turn though and it plays the same no matter the order shit plays out. You're just waiting for your turn to arrive or gaining or losing turns. Zero significant difference.

Just because it was poorly used or implemented it doesn't make it inherently turn-based.

&gt; gambits exist and characters actions can be totally automated

Automation doesn't make it turn based, it just makes the process quicker.

&gt; Actions are also changed on the fly when variables like deaths and status ailments enter the game and the input or task a character was going to complete prior to action is now changed because of a higher priority gambit.

I don't see how this is an argument for ATB being turn-based. If you cancel a charging action you have to wait longer and the enemy has a greater chance of acting before you.

""Do you know what it felt like to watch them die? Right before my eyes? It was the only thing we could do. It was the only choice we had. I gave in, I accepted, I believed. I allowed it to be true. I thought I'd be able to go through with it without ever doubting myself. But I... It hurts so much.""

―Lightning, Final Fantasy XIII

""Time is our greatest obsession. Who has not dreamed of returning to the past, of changing the future? Imagine the power. To see how our choices affect our lives, and then return to undo them. Endless possibilities. Imagine the freedom to cross time and journey through the ages. The freedom to change the past, and bend history to your will. What would you do if you had that power? Could you eradicate the mistakes of history, and build a perfect future? Or would you be subject to fate, and be swept down the river of time... powerless to change your course?""

10780,"Both faiths began as the teachings of a single man and both witnessed exponential, almost miraculous growth in just a few centuries. However the method by which the two faiths spread could not have been more different. For the first three centuries AD, Christianity had spread by peaceful conversion. Then once it became adopted as the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th Century AD, Christians had sufficient power to dominate, intimidate, and supress other religions. The followers of Islam on the other hand used military force from the very beginning of their history, even during the life of Muhammad himself. Towns were brought under Islamic rule by conquest, and their main churches and temples were usually converted to mosques. Christians and Jews were treated a little fairer than followers of other religions as they were considered Abrahamic Faiths and would be tolerated as long as they paid the Jizya, a special tax that Jews and Christians had to pay the Islamic state in order to practice their religion. In the first few centuries of Islamic rule, there is no evidence of forced conversion of Christians or Jews, nevertheless there were considerable economic and social pressures to convert to the ruling religion.",2016-01-25 19:24:11+00:00,czbjuz8,6.0,t1_czbima2,1718.0,ukpolitics

12009,"When I was halfway through (UK) college my father was arrested for producing child porn. He almost ripped two families apart in the fallout and my father has been disowned by everyone. The only close family I had left was my mother. My siblings are much older than me and had already moved out. In between college and university my mother moved back to my home city where our extended family lived. While I'm now almost finishing my MSci my mother is barely making ends meet while my sister has had to move back in due to financial issues herself.

I was an emotional bedrock for my mother; I don't know how she could have coped living alone. I had too much to do to breakdown. I quite like the lyrics of Last Cup of Sorrow by Faith No More:
&gt; Like a snake between two stones
it itches in your bones.

&gt;Take a deep breath and swallow
your sorrow
tomorrow.

&gt;So raise it up and lets propose a toast.

&gt;To the thing that hurts you most.

&gt;It's your last cup of sorrow.

&gt;What can you say?

&gt;Finish it today.

&gt;It's your last cup of sorrow.

&gt;So think of me
and get on your way.

&gt;It won't begin
until you make it end.

&gt;Until you know the how the where and the when.

12070,"Don't do a year abroad in university unless you have amazing mental strength and are willing to take a hit in your average.

I'm from England. My university has a standard assessment scheme for each department; strictly no midterm tests but regular small assignments, often one end of module test and always a final exam either in January or May/June. Class organisation is a lot freer e.g. times could be Tue 10:00 and Fri 14:00. The day began at 09:00. All course notes and lab equipment was free.

I decided to do a year in Canada.

If it weren't for my amazing friends, I wouldn't have finished my course. There was no cooperation between course conveners leading to dramatically different courses for the same degree scheme. One course had *three* midterms and a final with online course notes consisting of scanned chicken scratches. You have to pay through the teeth for physical copies of course notes, replacement lab equipment and even your safety gear. The mental juggling required just overwhelmed me.

I was raised in a Catholic family and went to Catholic school, so I wasn't a ""proper"" atheist. As I progressed through school I became more cynical and felt like I was in a morose cult. I then attended a secular college and basically felt liberated from a bunch of masochists.

There was a Baptist church down the road that did a weekly lunch and chat. The pastor was intelligent and spoke well; not using the bullshit arguments you often hear from fundies. He didn't antagonise our scientific knowledge and kept it strictly philosophical. Late in the year a group of university students visited and they invited me to their events. Their combined effort in explaining the gospel overwhelmed anything Dawkins could offer. The difference between Baptist worship to Catholic groveling was astounding. It's a celebration and pep talk every week! Let's just say it's one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. Going to that church was like going to a social club.

12436,"Exhausted.

I don't think I've experienced a weekend like this before. I was at a 24h LAN party at uni and at the halfway point the power went out except for backup lighting. We quickly found out that the whole city had a blackout and was flooded like crazy. My friends and I just resorted to playing regular party games through the night and we also took the opportunity to take a walk around campus in complete darkness because it wasn't something that would ever happen again in our time at uni. Morning broke and we packed away and took home our gear.

After a short nap I discovered that almost all of my food was wasted, including a £20 turkey. Needless to say the house mood was one of annoyance. I went to the centre of campus to find out information. The university won't regain power for three days. We weren't allowed to stay in our residences due to the safety measures not working in them. Anyone who couldn't return home had to sleep in the Great Hall as if Sirius Black was the one who blew up the power substation.

The campus businesses and chaplaincy tried their best to provide food to everyone. The university called in emergency transport as many roads were closed and local rail was suspended. Thousands of students were swarming on the coaches and I was lucky enough to get on one to a nearby city with stable transport connections. My mum just happened to be at church and one of her friends was graceful enough to pay for a coach journey as I didn't have enough money. I'm currently waiting for my last connecting coach home at 03:39 with pretty much 2h sleep for a crazy weekend.

12943,"&gt; Jeremy Corbyn rose to his feet in the House of Commons on Wednesday to the sound of a party falling apart. No jeering or heckling, just sullen silence from ranks of Labour MPs who believe their leader is taking them into a political abyss.
&gt; 
&gt; The gap between Mr Corbyn and the MPs he aspires to lead has this week widened to a chasm, as the party comes to terms with the national security, and electoral, implications of having a pacifist as its leader.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Corbyn’s initial refusal on Monday to endorse a shoot-to-kill policy for British police confronted by a terrorist trying to kill people plunged the Labour leader into what one MP called a “horrible” confrontation with his parliamentary party.
&gt; 
&gt; One shadow minister told the Financial Times that the PLP meeting, at which Mr Corbyn was heckled by MPs, had made him feel physically sick: “I just don’t know how much longer I can do this,” he said. “It’s truly terrible.”
&gt; 
&gt; On Tuesday Mr Corbyn fumbled his lines several times during his response to the prime minister’s statement on Paris and Syria. MPs from both sides of the Commons were talking over the Labour leader by the end of his speech.
&gt; 
&gt; What happened next was even worse. A series of Labour MPs pointedly spoke in support of the prime minister’s approach to national security, undermining Mr Corbyn from the backbenches where he spent 32 years.
&gt; 
&gt; “The content and tone of the prime minister’s statement spoke not just for the government but for the country,” said Mike Gapes, the former Labour chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee.
&gt; 
&gt; Other Labour MPs condemned the words of the Stop the War Coalition, which Mr Corbyn once chaired, which claimed that Paris was “reaping the whirlwind” of western military intervention in the Middle East. Mr Corbyn is billed as a special guest at the group’s Christmas dinner.
&gt; 
&gt; Labour’s front bench gradually emptied as he made his statement, leaving Mr Corbyn almost alone. One Labour MP said: “He looked like a broken man.” Another said: “The only think that’s keeping us cheerful is that he’s so useless.”
&gt; 
&gt; But the hostility shown towards Mr Corbyn by his MPs — of whom fewer than 20 backed him for the Labour leadership — is matched by a sense of impotence: “It can’t go on,” said one senior MP. “But how’s it going to end?”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Corbyn is sustained by the knowledge that 250,000 ordinary party members and supporters backed him, creating a dangerous gap between the parliamentary party and the Labour grass roots.
&gt; If MPs mount a coup the party membership could still re-elect Mr Corbyn: his allies are seeking to clarify the rules to ensure that he would automatically end up back on the ballot sheet.
&gt; 
&gt; “He’s still very purposeful,” said one friend of Mr Corbyn. “He’s quite relaxed about all of this. People are still rooting for him. All that support that was there for him still feels like it’s there.”
&gt; 
&gt; Even Mr Corbyn’s critics admit it could take several years before the “Corbynistas” realise their alleged mistake and in the meantime the Labour leader is trying to tighten his grip on the party.
&gt; 
&gt; Grass roots members of the Momentum pressure group are telling dissident MPs to keep quiet or face deselection at the 2020 election; Seumas Milne, a leftwing former Guardian journalist, has been hired as his new media chief.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Corbyn wants Labour MPs to abstain in a vote on Trident next week when the party’s official stance — endorsed by this year’s party conference — is for Britain to maintain its deterrent.
&gt; 
&gt; For now, at least, Britain’s official opposition has no policy on whether the UK should remain a nuclear power.
&gt; 
&gt; Ultimately Mr Corbyn’s fate will be determined at the ballot box: he needs to show his critics that his “new politics” appeals beyond a hard core of supporters. The Oldham West by-election next month, where Labour is defending a majority of almost 15,000, will be a crucial early test.",2015-11-19 14:53:54+00:00,cx5q87r,1.0,t3_3tfrt7,414.0,ukpolitics

There is a small Baptist church next to it which at the time had a very intelligent and charismatic pastor. He ran a weekly free lunch club for students and I liked debating with him afterwards (he always had the upper hand on me). A group of university students visited the church for a fortnight and they talked about their faith which I had never encountered before. They melted my cynical heart and invited me to join their activities in the area. It felt *good* to be a Christian for the first time and satisfied in a new way. Unfortunately, the pastor moved on in life and his replacement was less nuanced in his preaching. I felt alienated as, although the old pastor is a man of science, the patronage was completely fundie and the new pastor encouraged it. They were friendly but I felt I couldn't stay.

15409,"My primary school experience can be summed up as ""the long grass gets cut"". I'm not one to toot my own horn but I was remarkably gifted, though I had schizotypal tendencies. The teachers didn't know what to do; I found the work too easy, got bored and misbehaved and they punished me heavily while they did little to stop the bullying. Let's just say they succeeded where the Dursleys failed and stomped the gift out of me.  
When I got into secondary school my mental issues and distrust of teachers carried over. I clashed heavily with teachers when the subject didn't interest me and I resisted writing essays as long as possible, eventually almost being kicked off GCSE English. Meanwhile the bullying continued, though I managed to build a small social circle.
The teachers never seemed to understand that low motivation kills learning. I got an A* in the GCSE English creative writing assignment because I *enjoyed* it. I hated bullshitting about Great Expectations and subliminal messages in shampoo adverts and in the end I got an average of a C. I got A* in Maths and Science and now I'm in university doing Natural Sciences (Chemistry formerly alongside Maths and Physics).

* Food costs around the same with a few differences. E.g., veal is popular so it's cheaper than in the UK. Good luck getting cheap bangers, though.
* Telecoms is crazy expensive due to the duopoly between Rogers and Virgin. You're looking at $40 per month for a decent mobile plan.
* Can't really comment on property and utility prices as a student but the uni accommodation was way cheaper.
* Fuel is much cheaper, my friends were incredulous when I told them how much it cost here.
* Buses aren't very different in quality but you can go long distances on them. Imagine going from London to Manchester on two buses. Rail is sparse.
* The government is as crooked as ours but an election's coming soon.
