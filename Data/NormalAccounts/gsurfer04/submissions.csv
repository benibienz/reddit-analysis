When the referendum happened, traders shat the bed and there was a seemingly permanent shift for the GBP, though the FTSE indices etc. soon rallied again. World leaders had their concerns and sometimes expressed their annoyance. There is potential for economic downturn though effective trade diplomacy will ameliorate this. PM May has been stubborn in regards to A50, much to the chagrin of many, but that could be an asset in the two year process. Overall, nobody is really thinking the sky is falling due to Brexit.

On the other hand, the USA just elected an incredibly rich and morally ambiguous man with no political experience as their head of state. Nobody, not even the traders, know how to respond. There has been a severe knock on international markets from NIKKEI to Brent crude. The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar have taken a hammering. We don't know if Trump's actions and words during the campaign truly reflect his policy plans. Duterte, of all people, has backed Trump.

I am especially frustrated by the polarisation from the referendum. 

On one side you have the extreme EUphiles that cannot stand to see *le projet* criticised. They shit on any good news and often have seething hatred for the majority of the population. More concerning is their willful ignorance of the aims of the EU. In unison they give each other upvote pats on the back and downvote dissent into oblivion.

On the other side you have those who think this whole Brexit business is gonna be sunshine and rainbows. They relentlessly mock the 48% and think we'll have a plethora of FTAs waiting for us in two years. Sorry guys, I may have voted Leave but I'm not that bloody naive. It's going to be a painful few years.

The worst part is when one of these sides dominates and you find perfectly reasonable comments at -10.

**1) How did you vote in the EU referendum?**

**2) Do you believe that the EU wishes to create a ""United States of Europe""?**

Unfortunately, I only got 215 responses, so take this analysis with a pinch of salt.

Firstly, the responses to the questions:

http://imgur.com/H6Tw1e1

http://imgur.com/apxN12E

It's clear that the sample wasn't representative of the population in regards to the referendum, but that isn't actually important for this analysis.

Overall, there is significant support for the belief that the EU wants to create a federal state.

The next step is to take the referendum answer groups and analyse how they answered the second question.

**Leave (111)**

http://imgur.com/G6ASfez

Unsurprisingly, there is an almost unanimous belief amongst Leave voters that the EU has federal desires.

**Remain (83)**

http://imgur.com/PaQk4UT

This may be very surprising to some here. A clear majority of Remain voters believe that the EU wishes to create a USE. Granted, a significant number may be federalists themselves and fully support the creation of a USE. If this were a more thorough poll I could have asked whether people supported a USE.

Did Not Vote (21):

http://imgur.com/kTYpmNR

This is just for thoroughness. It's pretty much identical to Remain but I'd say it's coincidence in the absence of a significant sample size.",ukpolitics,Poll Results: Perceived Intention of the EU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/554x7d/poll_results_perceived_intention_of_the_eu/

From my experience way back with Forza 4 it was never problematic to just chuck all the upgrades on and have a competitive car. However, in FH3 my classic engine builds have been really slow compared to the drivatars with little reason as they have around the same PI. If the drivatars are out accelerating me then the logic of balance would suggest they'd be rubbish in the corners but they're really not. I can't shorten the gears as I'm already almost buzzing on the limiter on the longest straights.

The stat scales are really wonky. My Barchetta has 796 PI and a Braking stat of 9.6 while only having 5.6 Speed. It has a decent Acceleration of 8.6 so how can I be left in the dust out of the corners?

We need to come together to heal the divisions exposed by the vote. We have to respect the decision that has been made, hold the government to democratic account over its response, and ensure that working people don't pay the price of exit.

Neither wing of the Tory government has an exit plan. Labour will now ensure that our reform agenda is at the heart of the negotiations that lie ahead. That includes the freedom to shape our economy for the future and the necessity of protecting social and employment rights.

One clear message from last Thursday's vote is that millions of people feel shut out of a political and economic system that has let them down and scarred our country with grotesque levels of inequality.

I was elected by hundreds of thousands of Labour Party members and supporters with an overwhelming mandate for a different kind of politics.

I regret there have been resignations today from my shadow cabinet. But I am not going to betray the trust of those who voted for me - or the millions of supporters across the country who need Labour to represent them.

Those who want to change Labour's leadership will have to stand in a democratic election, in which I will be a candidate.

Over the next 24 hours I will reshape my shadow cabinet and announce a new leadership team to take forward Labour's campaign for a fairer Britain - and to get the best deal with Europe for our people.",ukpolitics,Jeremy Corbyn's discussion of the current situation on Facebook,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/4q0ay0/jeremy_corbyns_discussion_of_the_current/

I'm at a serious impasse regarding this question. I've answered all but this question in my assignment and it's frustrating that the course notes give no help in this.

I wasn't taught what the μ notation means nor about the structures of ferritin models. I'm guessing μ denotes a bridging ligand?

I know that oxygen binds very well to Fe, hence why it needs to be carefully controlled around it. The chelating nature of L can't be ignored.

Is the symmetry of the structures important? I know that natural ferritin has 3 and 4-fold symmetry.",chemhelp,Synthetic Ferritin models,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemhelp/comments/40dgkm/synthetic_ferritin_models/

Since yesterday this not-so-quick fix no longer works.
I'd be very grateful if anyone could tell me if it's a hardware issue because I know my computer's taken some punishment in the past.

My specs are:

* Windows 10 Pro 10240
* AMD FX-8350 4GHz 8 Core
* NVidia GTX 670 (Palit)
* 2x4GB G.Skill F3-12800CL9-4GBXL
* ASRock 990FX Extreme3 motherboard

The dump analysis from WinDbg for my latest BSOD is as follows:

    SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e)
    This is a very common bugcheck.  Usually the exception address pinpoints
    the driver/function that caused the problem.  Always note this address
    as well as the link date of the driver/image that contains this address.
    Some common problems are exception code 0x80000003.  This means a hard
    coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but this system was booted
    /NODEBUG.  This is not supposed to happen as developers should never have
    hardcoded breakpoints in retail code, but ...
    If this happens, make sure a debugger gets connected, and the
    system is booted /DEBUG.  This will let us see why this breakpoint is
    happening.
    Arguments:
    Arg1: ffffffffc0000005, The exception code that was not handled
    Arg2: fffff800d12bb204, The address that the exception occurred at
    Arg3: ffffd00023616558, Exception Record Address
    Arg4: ffffd00023615d70, Context Record Address

* Our very own /r/ukpolitics: gets a bit shouty but that's politics for you. Overall, diverse but with a dearth of Conservatives. Probably loads of shy Tories. Good news source.
* /r/UnitedKingdom: Our red-at-heart brethren. The main news source but any sniff of politics gets the shit hitting the fan. UKIP supporters like myself are periwinkle pariahs when we try to defend their policies; Tories are little better off. In the absence of politics it's really quite friendly.
* /r/britishproblems and /r/BritishSuccess are essentially the twin offspring of /r/unitedkingdom. Don't let the no politics policy fool you, it gets ugly in the comments sometimes.

I haven't been subbed to others in the UK category apart from /r/INGLIN (dark times) but I have an idea which I think will help: a news subreddit in which politics is explicitly forbidden.

Our political landscape lately has been quite chaotic and as such /r/unitedkingdom has been inundated with political articles, particularly involving a certain Labour leader candidate. Quite frankly it's a left wing frenzy and I actually would like to get my non-political news from a more sensible place.

There is another generic UK news sub: /r/UKNews. It looks nice but it's pretty much a ghost town compared to /r/unitedkingdom. What would you think of reviving it into a politics-free zone, with the mods' approval of course?",ukpolitics,[META] My experience of British subreddits and a proposition.,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3hwrcs/meta_my_experience_of_british_subreddits_and_a/
