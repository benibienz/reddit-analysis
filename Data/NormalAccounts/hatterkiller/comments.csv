##Facts

‚Ä¢ Level 36 Steam Profile

‚Ä¢ 23 Steam friends

‚Ä¢ 164 hours on BH

‚Ä¢ Very unused reddit account. This is OPs first post on /r/Brawlhalla 

## Hatter's opinion:

‚Ä¢ Seems ok, but be careful of scams (applies to both buyer and for OP). I can offer middleman service if needed. 

‚Ä¢ Key trading, as always, is fishy and risky.

##Facts

‚Ä¢ OP has been posting a lot for trading codes. Claims to have [metadev code on previous posts, yet later asks for a metadev code](http://prntscr.com/d96oko), so there's some contradiction there.

‚Ä¢ -8 comment karma (negative eight). 

‚Ä¢ No link to steam profile, can't find more info.

42,"I agree with pretty much every thing you said. I shall exaggerate slightly in my response. 

‚Ä¢ Passive players are the most irritating thing. BH is a fighting game, not a run-away and poke game (which is all I see now). 

‚Ä¢ Jump lag better be implemented in actual gameplay. It feels **soo** much better. 

‚Ä¢ Safe sigs, I personally don't have much of an issue. It's just the newer legends get so many fancy ass sigs, and the older ones are just stuck with not-so signature signatures, like ada's ssig being very similar to cassidy's gun ssig and thatch's gun ssig and pretty much every old legend's gun ssig. 

‚Ä¢ Hammer OP. I can confirm. 

‚Ä¢ Blasters are indeed balanced, and are risk reward, not norisk-reward like some weapons are (hammer I'm looking at you)

‚Ä¢ Katars, I still don't know how to play them. Nair? Same for axe. Dair?

‚Ä¢ Gadgets are imo still useful in ranked, when used as a space covering option to bait out passive players. With passive players removed, then I see no point in gadgets. The horn is good though. Me likey horn. 

‚Ä¢ This comment is probs gonna get downvoted by people so obsessed with taking away people's internet points.

Nailed it right there. I main Teros (and Ada/Orion). This axe ""nerf"" (more like increased consistency with the actual axe sprite) is just more reason for me to get better at the axe. Not a reason to pour all the salt onto the Devs who actually did something good. 

Also, thank you /u/Antipop_BH for saying that ""I believe you've become way too accustomed to the crazy hitboxes that axe had and are now struggling to adapt"".

130,"Some comments building off of OP

-------
Spear was worse (meaning kinda over powered) before, with the *dlight* having a much larger hitbox etc. Now it's better, but it is evident that issues do exist. 

I feel like an increased recovery time of *spear nlight* would alleviate the issues with whiffed *nlights*, and would also make dodging *nlight* more successful for the attacker. 

By increasing *nlight's* recovery time, spear players will now think twice before whiffing the *nlight*. 

Another suggestion would be (like OP said) to increase the time to hit of the *dlight*. This would mean that the spear users have to plan when to use the *dlight*, as opposed to it being used often as a parry move. Since this would make the *dlight* very hard to hit, and basically only risk-risk, increasing the damage of the *dlight* would make this move more risk-reward",2016-09-18 02:01:56+00:00,d7r9wks,1.0,t3_537sqb,36039.0,Brawlhalla

I'm an SEA main, but I barely play ranked. Nowadays I play the game called IB instead of Brawlhalla.  I think I'm some place in Plat, but I mostly just spar and play customs with friends. 



I was going to post a more lengthy post, but almost all my points are more or less the same as /u/OnTilt_ 's, although there are some differences in our opinions that I would like to state:

(PURE Opinion)

----
**Weapon Throws** - Agreed that the weapon throws in the current Meta (in SEA, not sure about other servers but it seems like it is the same) are ridiculous. It gets annoying that people continuously throw weapons at you during ladder matches. I use large weapons as a means of getting around, covering my landings or ascents, which is why I agree with your suggestion to add some sort of cooldown to weapon throws. 

In my opinion, weapon throws should be used as a strategical move, instead of bombarding the enemy with weapons. 

**Bombs** - Disagree. I understand your point, but to me, bombs are another level to the strategy of the game. I feel as if bombs were meant to be used strategically. For example, you can toss a bomb up to limit the possibilities for the enemy's movement. Random cheese deaths are not too difficult to avoid if you  just catch the bomb and use it to your own advantage. Overall, the bomb/mine system is fine as it is, with their many tactical applications, although catching bombs could be a bit easier (BMG's recent addition to the bomb training room helps newer players practice this skill)

**Bow** - I can't say much about bows... I don't really see many bow players in SEA. 

**Passive play** - Oh god. This is an issue. Like OnTilt said, BMG has done quite a lot to help fix this issue while not completely destroying the passive play. I do agree that passive play is still a bit too rewarding, but good aggressive play can counter good passive play (to be honest, ""good passive play"", in my opinion, just becomes parry play. Once you get to a certain level, they're quite hard to distinguish)

Spear has been nerfed quite a lot recently. No problem here for me. 

Blasters (guns whatever) are often used passively by an inexperienced player, but I do feel as if aggressive gun play is much more rewarding than passive gun play.

Axe: The recovery and GP are basically the new ex-lance (for reference, the lance nAir used to have a circle hitbox, instead of the ring hitbox it currently has). 

To be honest, every weapon is the same in terms of passive play. No weapon ""promotes"" passive play. Instead, passivity is just something that exists with every weapon. It's just that people decide to play passive. 

----

Overall, I agree with some of your points, but others I disagree. 

For the ones I did not mention, my opinions were basically the same as /u/OnTilt_)

306,"Deranted Version:

Contrary to popular belief, I believe that Hattori is not over powered. The main issue with Hattori is that her moves are fast and have little punish windows, which makes it difficult for newer players to punish her. I know many new Brawlhalla players that have quit this game in sheer frustration from playing against Hattoris. 

I also feel that there is no need to insult other players post game. If they found a playstyle that works against newer players and they lose a game, they should not insult the winner. Brawlhalla is not supposed to by synonymous with Ragehalla, but in some cases it seems like it is. 

To the developers of this wonderful game, do you keep extensive statistics about the frequency of the legends in game? I would suggest some sort of popularity nerf if the distribution is too skewed.

307,"Nai Spear Sig Overview:

---
###nSig: 45¬∞ upward spiral snake punch thing
Completely vulnerable from the back, and to an extent the front. Jhala's sword sSig could punish this move.

###sSig: Horizontal gtfo snake shove
Completely vulnerable from above and behind. 

###dSig: Jump up and launch a snake that covers a shitton of area
Just jump above this. Or be really close to Nai. This sig has an area between the hitbox and the nai that is safe. 

----

Nai spear sigs are basically stationary sigs, meaning she doesn't move much while doing them. Jhala isn't the fastest, but Nai is slower. If you generally stay out of range of the sigs you will be fine. The sigs are slow, so they can be easily countered if whiffed.  ",2016-07-01 02:11:55+00:00,d4utwvw,1.0,t3_4qozju,5500.0,Brawlhalla

355,"I would firstly like to say, welcome to Brawlhalla! I always love seeing Smash players try this game. 

BlueMammoth Games (Brawlhalla creators), are still relatively small. They currently have 6 main server areas, and only 6. Those are:  [US-E] [EU] [SEA] [BRZ] [AUS] [US-W]. If you are not near any of those 6 regions, then unfortunately, you will lag. For me, I live in SEA, so I never had issues with lag, other than times when I was using up my internet in other ways alongside Brawlhalla. I'm sure as the game grows and gains more popularity, the server accessibility will grow as well. The game is also in Beta, but I'm not sure if that correlates to lag or not. 

I wish I could agree to your comment on aggressive being the best style ever. As of now, the game is struggling on buffing the aggressive play to counter the ever increasing passive/parry players. Adding more defence mechanisms would further worsen the passive problem. 

On the topic of priority, /u/Iybraesil posted a link to Berthen's video somewhere in this thread. 

I don't see any issues on how hitboxes work. Many of Brawlhalla game mechanics are novel as opposed to how other games work. Yes, it may seem as if bullets are appearing mid-air, but that is how the ~~guns~~ blasters in Brawlhalla work. 

For elo, I personally think it doesn't matter what the ranking system is called. In my opinion, the word ""elo"" is not restrained only just to the rating system that Arpad Elo created. Yes, Brawlhalla elo is a modified version of Arpad Elo's elo, but it would be redundant to call it ""Modified Elo"" instead of the plain ""elo"". 

I don't touch Thatch so I don't have any opinion on that. I'm sure there are other Thatch players who can comment on it. 

Adding on to what I mentioned before, the developers are still finding a method to further benefit aggressive play while still keeping the game balanced. I hold strong belief that the developers will do something about ‚Äìto put it simply‚Äì the current passive meta before going out of Beta. 

Regards,

Hatterkiller

363,"# ALL OPINION BELOW. 

I agree with Magma here. Basic spear is easy to pick up, but advanced spear play is not that simple. 

Furthermore, I do not agree with the notion of the spear and sword being a ""noskill pleb weapon"". A considerable amount of skill and effort is needed to play aggressive spear (Take note that aggressive is **not** synonymous with parry. They look similar, but aggressive people strike first, parry strike in response). 

In response to passive spear play, it's not that hard to counter. I find that rush down play works to counter passive spear people that I encounter in Strikeout. 

I do not agree with a spear nerf. I think the spear is fine as of now. The sair is easily punishable if you know when to attack, and it is the same for pretty much every sair in the game. On the other hand, I do agree that other weapons should get a slight spacing buff. 

tl;dr: Spear is not a ""no skill"" weapon. All weapons take skill to master. Passive spear is easily countered. No more spear nerf, but buff spacing of other weapons.

411,"I have some plausible solutions. Please don't start ranting about how my opinion is wrong. It's an opinion. Not a fact. 

Sorry for the technical math-y stuff below. 

## Unmoving spot dodge players
One idea is that there should be a minimum amount of movement someone has to do to have the match ""count"". As of now, you don't get your xp/gold if you afk during a match. 

Something similar to this could possibly be implemented, and if you do not move enough, you don't get your elo, etc. 

To find the minimum boundary, I am thinking of a ""data collection week"" where the developers take a random sample of `x` amount of games a day. For the `x` games sampled, the mean and standard deviation of the distance of the player's movement should be calculated, along with the duration of the game (in seconds). Since different games are different lengths, the ratio of `distance/time` should be computed (i.e., speed). With this, it is possible to find the mean ""distance/time"" ratio of the random sample, as well as an appropriate lower range of the ratio. 

I don't think the game currently tracks the distance you travel in your matches, an implementation of this would possibly slow down servers. One way to reduce the consequences of this problem is to announce to the players that ""this week is a sampling week"", and that the servers may be slower. Because some players may get mad, it should made clear that this sampling is to be done in order to help balance the game more. 

This is just one way of tackling the issue of people just staying in one spot the entire game and spot dodging. 

## Dodge Parry
I personally think adding more risk to the dodge would ruin the game, as it would hinder those who use dodge aggressively, among other reasons. 

Instead, the focus should me made to buff the aggressive playstyle instead of nerfing the passive playstyle. One example of this was the momentum dodge, which highly diversified the aggressive side of Brawlhalla. With this, it should be easier to counter the passive dodge counter playstyle. 

Yet this poses another problem of not being able to counter the aggressive playstyle. I fully respect the devs not being able to find a solution to this, because more than likely there isn't. It is a problem of the balance between passive and aggressive, and finding the balance point is like finding the holy grail. Almost impossible. 

I do not know a solution to the dodge parry playstyle yet, but I am almost absolutely certain that the solution is in changing the aggressive playstyle, and not nerfing the parry playstyle.

431,"There was this one guy, whom I will never forget. I'll just say his name is Marco. Because why not.

So I'm a tour guide in the super kawaii city of Kyoto in Japan. Golden temple and what not. One day, I get a reservation with a group of 5 tourists from France. A half day tour around the city of Kyoto. So far so normal. 

The day of the tour comes, and I go to the designated meeting point 30 minutes before, to get ready and put on a good first impression for my touring company. The meeting point was in the lobby of an undisclosed hotel. 10 minutes before the meeting time, I  hold up my tour company sign, and sit there and waited for the group of 5 French people to arrive. 

The thing is, they never came. Well, one guy did. Marco. Marco was, to put it simply, generic. He's around 5 foot, brown hair, generic face. He looked like an ordinary tourist. He didn't have any personal belongings on his body (e.g., bag), so I didn't know that he was going to be part of my group. He exited the elevator, and headed straight towards me. At first, I did not know that Marco was to be in my tour group, as he was all alone, but his course stayed sturdy. It didn't matter who was in front of him, he just plowed through the entire lobby. After a while I realised that his destination was me, sitting in a plush sofa while holding up a tour sign with one hand. He approached me and promptly asked, ""Are you the tour guide?"". 

""Yes"", I responded, ""Where is the rest of your group?"". 

""I am the group"". 

That set me back a bit. He is the group? ""What do you mean?""

""I am the only one in the group. There are no others"". 

I asked him who bought the 4 other tickets. He did. Marco, the lone frenchman, just decided to buy 5 slots to a tour in Japan just for himself. I don't know about anyone else, but to me that's just plain odd. I was hoping that the rest of the tour would be the same, but no. How wrong I was. 

This was just the beginning. I walked him to our van, patiently waiting outside. The driver looked at me questionably, and I just replied with a shrug. Honestly, I was as confused as he was. For some quick background detail, this van is one of those Toyota vans with 4 rows, including the driver's row. Marco decided to sit down in the third row of the van. He opened the curtains of the window, and stared blankly outside. 

And that's how he stayed the entire time, on every van ride. I sat in the passenger's seat, and after a few moments of awkward silence, I decided to start some small talk. Sorry, I tried my best. Marco never replied. He just sat there, looking out the window of the van like some human statue. Writing this, I remember that he could have been the centrepiece of a statue appropriately named: ""Man looking outside van window"". 

So anyways, the day went on without a word from Marco. As we neared lunchtime, our final destination was this shrine. Like many other shrines in Japan, this one had a bell and a rope. You shake the rope and the bell makes this gong sound. Or a measly chink, depending on where you go. Upon arrival, Marco made a beeline towards the bell. Going through the gate clearly marked ""exit"", Marco got some nasty glares from the shrine security guard. I raced to catch up to him. Mind you, there's a lot of stairs to get to the bell, but Marco just vaulted over the stairs like his inner Olympian switch just turned on. I on the other hand, was visibly panting a quarter of the way there. 

Much like he did in the lobby, Marco barged through the crowd of tourists taking pictures and selfies and approached the bell. Once I got to the bell, I just saw Marco standing blankly in front of the bell. Some awkward silence ensued, and after some period of time, Marco looked up at the bell, and yelled the following words at the top of his lungs. This is word for word what he said:

""CLINK CLINK BITCHES""

He started to furiously shake the rope of the bell, consequently creating a distorted ringing sound. Then he ran straight back down the stairs to the entrance of the shrine, and left. 

I never saw him again. 

After a shitton of apologising, I went back to the hotel. I asked reception if Marco was back. After some typing, they looked at me with this strange look and said, ""We don't have a Marco"". 

So that basically marked the end of my trip with Marco. I still never heard from Marco ever again. ",2016-05-10 09:16:46+00:00,d2zpyol,1.0,t3_4ioa2z,2828.0,AskReddit

In addition, it simply isn't possible to prevent our ideas from being seen by people other than ""your 10 friends"". People can look over your shoulder. People can screenshot an embarrassing picture. People can copy and paste a highly controversial rant that you posted on Just10, and it can continue to spread to other social media. 

Furthermore, an ad free alternate to Facebook already exists today. It's known as Facebook with Ad block installed. It's a great idea to make a website ad free from the start, but I see no point as many people already have Ad block (or any other counterpart) installed.

554,"If I were you, I'd play Hattori because she is free this week. 

In all honesty, you cannot ""find"" your main unless you spend a considerable amount of time with the legend. Ada was my first legend, and I stuck with Ada for a very long time. Ada is my main not because of her weapons, but because I am now very familiar with her **entire** moveset. The more you play a character, the more familiar they become to you, and the more of a ""main"" they become. In your case, just play Hattori for now. Check out some sick [combos](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlhalla/comments/3ggkys/1151_updated_combo_list) in the training room, and try them out in FFA or even 1v1. 

The spear is a versatile weapon, and I personally find you can play passively or even aggressively, depending on what you find best. Hattori's spear sigs are pretty neat, and they have a variety of different uses (e.g., nSig for anti-air punishment).

The bow, on the other hand, like bluetiger6001 said, is more of an aggressive weapon. If you use the bow ""correctly"" (there really isn't a ""correct"" way, but I hope you get what I mean), with combos and what not, it can be a great damage builder and frustrate the crap out of your opponent.

Finally, in my opinion, I find Koji's sword sigs to be **extremely** punishable. Consider the dSig. It's target marking star thing shouts: ""Hey! By all means please punish me at that exact location!"". In my opinion, Hattori's sword sigs are much more useful and versatile.
