Bit of background. I mainly play two games, Brawlhalla and Overwatch. I've been very active in the Brawlhalla community, and started a community for Brawlhalla Artists and such. 

After around 6 successful months, the Brawlhalla artist Discord server grew pretty big. Now I believe is a good time for the server to expand to other games. 

I have also snooped around the Overwatch community for a while, and realised that there isn't a place for Artists and Content Creators to mingle, share tips, and give feedback. 


So now I present you the Gaming Artists discord server. It is a place for Artists, content creators, and others to come together, talk art, and share ideas and advice! Non-artsty people are welcome as well! Some may be inspired to become artsy people themselves. 

We also plan to expand our reaches to other games other than Brawlhalla and Overwatch! We are hyped to see where this leads.

I'm not sure of the steps I would take to find it. I've always thought that the range is all reall of *y* except for the horizontal asymptote, but it's wrong sometimes?

Here is an example of what this looks like, to clarify what a ""quadratic over quadratic"" is

[E.g](http://prntscr.com/d9g9zn)

^ Thats a screenshot of a random quadratic over a quadratic I made in Wolfram Alpha. Not a textbook question. It's similar to a homework problem, but I want to know the general steps to find a range of a quadratic/quadratic equation.

Stem cells: Stem cells originate from human cells. Hence, Stem Cells=Human Cells

Mitosis: The splitting of one cell into two genetically **identical** cells. 

[Definition of Cloning](http://prntscr.com/d5tnee)

When you use stem cells, you inject them. Then the cells replicate themselves through mitosis. 

Henceforth, through stem cell use, you are cloning human cells. But the catch is, this cloning (duplication) occurs naturally. 

After talking to an advisor, the POV of Singapore slightly changed. The delegate of Singapore is against whole organism cloning, and artificial cloning (like making cells. Red cross was wrong, there are artificial cells.), but is for the use of cell cloning to develop effective stem cell uses.

I just took a unit test and oh boy we all got ~~raped~~ destroyed.

The test was also designed to that we couldn't finish it (Paraphrased from the teacher). 

wtf. 

It was on Sequences/Series and Induction, and the problems were tons harder than the past papers I looked at. Example: [2015 Paper 1 HL TZ2 Q13](http://prnt.sc/cfycdw) was nothing like the problems we did on the test. 

I was wondering if any of you folks have some insanely challenging math problems for all IB Hl topics, separate from the textbooks (because those are nothing compared to the test that we just took) 

I would like to be better prepared next time so I can save myself from being ~~raped~~ destroyed in the future.

Anyways, I have over 450 hours in Brawlhalla. I have never touched Katars until I reached around 300 hours. Why, you may ask. 

Katars never made any sense to me, and they still do not. This is why I am asking for someone to get me better at katars. If I manage to get my 750 ~~Lucien~~ Ember to Gold with your help, I will be giving you a CC. 

I recently got the basic combos but that's pretty much it. I would like to learn some advanced strings and the ""mindset"" for katars

I got this CC quite a while back from some meh design work. I have never used the code before, but there is a **slight chance that the person who gave it to me might have accidentally given it out to someone else as well.** Fair warning. 

I main SEA, so I guess it'll be easier if you are SEA as well (timezones, ping etc). 

So that's pretty much it. I got 1 CC to spare (idk if it works), I want someone to get me better at katars, get my ~~Lucien~~ Ember to Gold, you get the CC. 

Oh also it will help you get better at katars because teaching someone a skill improves your skill as well.

**What is the Gaming Artists Discord?** The Gaming Artists Discord is a place for artists to share advice, give feedback, and enjoy making/producing art. This is the server for both experienced artists and novice artists alike. You don't have to be an artist; you can join just to see art in action, or to chat with some of the many artists in the gaming community. 

This Discord Server fulfills what the Slack channel lacks in post longevity and publicity. In the long run, the Gaming Artists aims to become the main congregation of art fans of not just Brawlhalla, but other games as well. 

The Mods of the Server are also planning some Art events that will be coming real soon!

Once again, anyone can join!! Here is the [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/hnkvVjw), and hope to see you guys in the Gaming Artists Discord!

Easiest way: Don't trade. 

Riskier way: Read below. My trading experience is at the very bottom. This guide is also my opinion and what I use when I trade. 

Take note: All of this is at your own risk. I am in no way responsible for any losses that you have. 

Propper mindset: Never trust anyone. 

# Buyer/Seller:
Check for profile level. Never trust someone under level 10 unless they are a highly reputable person in the community (e.g., /u/Diffensive -Level 6). Again, at your own risk. There is always a chance that even a highly reputable person will scam you. There are basic ""levels of protection"" that you should look for. 

1. Number of hours in the game: It is very suspicious if the seller is offering CCs and they only have 20 hours in the game. 
2. Profile level: Level 0-5 accounts are red flags. Scammers are more likely to have low profile levels, but high level scammers do exist. 
3. Number of PAID games: Scammers also tend to have little or no paid games. 
4. Reputation comments: Many pages of +rep comments tend to indicate a generally trustworthy person. Be wary of the time that they posted the comments. Make sure the comments are not fabricated. 
5. Friends list: Check their friends list, and also ask their friends. Check if any of the friends are reputable people in the community. 

Take note once again that even though you follow these steps, the person may scam you, and even though they do not fit these steps, the person may be trustworthy. 

# Trading Experience:

At least 45 +rep comments, 100+ reputable friends.

Feel free to message me in Discord @Нatterkiller 🎩 if you have any questions or concerns. I can provide some guidance if you are unsure of a trade, but please do not take my word as a certainty. There is always a risk of a scam, even from your ""best friend"". 

Thanks, and good luck!

This saves many players time when practicing combos. Now, a teleport bot back to designated location in training room feature would be an appropriate addition to make in the next major patch. I think this will pair extremely well with the hp reset option. 

This would help players who are trying to learn some more advanced ledge cancel combos, like the insane ones on Great Hall. 


This could possibly be implemented by having a ""Set Position"" button where it registers the (x,y) position of the bot where it is, and another ""Reset Position"" button where it moves the bot back to the registered (x,y). In terms of UI, these two buttons could possibly be aligned inline-block (i.e., side by side on one row) in the training room settings. Different fills would indicate whether a position is set or not.  

Possible issues may include the bot being stuck, but this can probably be resolved by rounding the stored (x,y) value to the nearest value that does not have it stuck in the ground or on a ledge.
