Was a huge drinker for years but finally quit and it has been great! Lost weight, been working out, feeling more positive and being more productive. 
Over a year ago I started a business from home and it has made to the point were I don't need my bartending job anymore.  So since I have been with this bar for 8 years, they are going to expect some sort of party when I quit. I am dreading being the square in their eyes but I already made it up in my mind I am not drinking.
Anyway, wanted to say ""hi"" everyone. My name is hooger0000 and I have been the sober bartender for 2 months.",stopdrinking,2 Months Sober Bartender,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/55xuit/2_months_sober_bartender/
