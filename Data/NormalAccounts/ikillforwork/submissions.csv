Im coming out now due to some recent problems with some of the staff. I have another article about the giveaway i won and never received, but thats another story. So i decided to help Mock It stream, free of charge just to help them, I later won another giveaway in which i was denied because i was ""staff"". Anyway long story short a couple fridays ago i had told them that i no longer wish to stream for them any more. They began attacking me, calling me a quitter, pussy etc. I told them i would continue the stream that evening because i knew it was short notice. well later that evening we had 5 teams sign up for the OW tournament. Luckey decided to make every team play every team, which in turn increased the wait time between games. Well Luckey didnt like this he began cursing at me and the caster because the wait times were too long, neither one of us made the decision to do a round robin. I had finally had enough and just turned the stream off and left the server. Today i tune into the twitch channel to see some rocket league play and i decided to ask about my giveaway, they quickly banned me and again no answers. This time peoples heads turned and began whispering me on twitch trying to figure out what the hell was going on. i can tell you they lost 15 subs tonight alone from this. Still no answer on the giveaway still a shady company thats out for the money. please do them a favor and no longer support them . follow PRL instead

edit #1 I have talked to Luckey, he says he will have me some info by tomorrow on tracking etc, but it was not shipped yet. despite being told that it was shipped on 6-24-2016. will update again when more comes
Here is a bold face lie about the hoverboard https://gyazo.com/d3f3e7ab64cf8c5e6f7d238ec548dd2b if he didnt know why not ask, why not say hey we had problems with shipping before i made this reddit

Its now 7-8-2016 and i havent received anything. On 6-24-2016 i was told the hoverboard had been shipped and tracking would be sent to me shortly. Still no word. I'm very disappointed in this so called Esports Company. I was a HUGE supporter, i even streamed the Overwatch tournaments for them for some time. If you see a Giveaway from Mock It, just proceed with caution, you might never get what was promised. I personally will no longer support this company, i will do everything in my power to make sure no one else does either.
