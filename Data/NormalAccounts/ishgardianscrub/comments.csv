It's dirty as shit but so is everywhere in China (been to Shanghai, Changsha, Yiyang, Feng Huang, HK and Macau). Coming from a small English town, BJ is really interesting. There is so many different areas and things to see, and it's not expensive to get around. I like the modern areas like Xidan and Sanlitun. Moreover the main thing I like about China is just how safe it is compared to places in England. Sure many people think England is ""super safe"", it must be it's a modern country! But in reality you can't walk around at night in a lot of towns/cities in England because the type of people walking around at night are the type of people who will start shit with you 70% of the time. In BJ the city is busy until quite late so it never feels dangerous.

Plus, being white means almost everyone I have ever interacted with in China has been friendly and helpful. Sure people stare at you but it's kind of nice, makes you feel like a famous person lol.",2016-01-16 22:43:02+00:00,cz0ug9k,2,t1_cz0qsyg,5848,AskReddit

81,"It's not the gameplay that is bad. It has the same gameplay as TPP which is some of the most fun 3rd Person Shooter gameplay ever made. The problems come from the SEVERE lack of content to keep you playing. On consoles we have been playing the same 3 modes &amp; 5 maps for 3 MONTHS. It get's very repetitive very quick. On top of that there is no ranking system other than the generic ""level-up"" style shit from CoD. 

I haven't played myself in quite a while because it lacks and real incentive to keep playing. Hopefully Survival &amp; Tournament modes aren't too far away and having a clan system in game like MGO2 would certainly help the social aspect of the game. Plus I REALLY REALLY HOPE that when the PC version launches for real it launches alongside a content patch to add new modes &amp; maps. 

And as an additional note, I know people will probably moan about this but at least for the first content patch, I'm not paying a penny. I'm happy to pay for DLC if it's considerable but the launch of MGO3 was so goddamn bare bones that I'm not willing to pay money for the first content patch, especially if the maps are just recycled single player environments which seems like they might be (Motherbase is going to be a map).

Edit: Oh and another gripe. As an MGO2 player, being able to customise your guy in so many ways was part of the fun, this has largely been stripped away to a bare minimum in MGO3. The options for customisation are severely lacking. There is hardly and equipment available and most of the interesting/unique pieces/colours cost Mother Base Coins (a hell of a lot of them).",2016-01-13 22:30:59+00:00,cyx73tq,1,t3_40s2be,31665,mgo

146,"Hey I don't know how long you've been playing but I only started recently and after reading a fair amount about the game, optimised my idle build and now I'm reaching 1000+ easily every run for 50,000+ HS with HZE of 1300.

1. First, try to join a clan that kills the raid bosses. The extra souls are great.

2. You can't do much about this, but above all else you want ""Chance of Primal Boss"" on your 4 relics, which caps at +4%.

3. You want to put all your gilds onto a single hero. If you can reach level 2500 with Samurai in a single run where every dies instantly then it's time to move the gilds onto Atlas. If you can reach level 1500 with Atlas with everything instantly dying, it's time to move gilds to the next ranger and so on.

4. On a run, level every hero to ~200 to unlock their skills but no more, and then only level the hero who has gilds in them.

5. Only spend rubies on Quick Ascension and nothing else, it's the best value.

6. http://hsoptimizer.github.io/ancient/ use this calculator specifically. It's not complicated. If you're on PC you can import your save file. If you're on mobile just manually type in your anicent levels and hero souls on hand. It will tell you the exact level to level all your ancients to. If you follow it exactly you'll have the most optimised build possible.

6. Stop levelling Chronos, he's not that useful and you don't have Morgulis, you need him. So get him as soon as possible.

7. With Mercs it's all random, I just send mine on the best possible reward each time, usually for HS. I believe there is some form of calculator for the PC version which will tell you the best mission each time to avoid them dying but it may be considered cheating.",2016-01-09 18:53:24+00:00,cys0dba,1,t3_4077l2,4126,ClickerHeroes

186,"I'm 24, been wearing glasses permanently since I was like 9 or 10 years old, I have Astigmatism in both eyes. It sucks. Here are my reasons.

1. I suffer from frequent headaches/migraines and my eyes can often be the cause of this. When they're really bad, I am basically incapacitated and usually vomit.

2. Having to spend money on new lenses for the glasses every 1-2 years is expensive and you often want to buy new glasses because wearing the same exact pair every waking minute of your life results in wear and tear. Usually costs hundreds of pounds for new lenses + frames that don't look shit.

3. Constantly having to clean them because a slight smudge on the lens can be frustrating and cause a headache.

4. Not being able to swim in a pool or the sea without being blind.

5. Not being able to do any kind of sport or intense physical activity while wearing glasses incase of injury to eyes/glasses breaking.

6. Lying down and watching something on the TV/Computer is uncomfortable because the glasses push into your face.

7. I feel like people who wear glasses are immediately less attractive to other people generally. Like most females just don't find someone who has to wear glasses attractive.

I see so many people wearing these fake glasses or wishing they needed glasses because it's fashionable. It fucking sucks being this blind. When I was a kid I could get away with not wearing them unless I needed to read the board in class. Nowadays I literally cannot see anything a foot in front of my face without glasses on. Being blind fucking sucks ass.

P.S I used to wear contact lenses for a few years because I wanted the freedom of not wearing glasses and I wanted to look not weird. They are great for that but personally after wearing them for 8-12 hours everyday it really gets painful, your eyes get red and sore and it can lead to headaches. Plus they're pretty expensive.",2016-01-07 02:48:13+00:00,cyovp21,1,t3_3zr67g,29037,AskReddit

Sometimes I do consider pulling out and just selling the whole lot but then I think about the effort I've gone to acquire this many and feel like i'd end up at a loss.

Like I said in my other comment, I really hope Nintendo adds some actual value to Amiibo to give collectors something to actually do with them.

[Garuda's Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqJRnD5HuZw) (this was my favourite before Heavensward came out)

[Sohm Al Dungeon Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCXfzpTUu8I) (this one is so epic, 1:09 is when the tears come out)

[Heavensward Dungeon Boss Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECNRH3-j5WY) (just flat out one of the best battle themes in the series, 1:23 is when the hype kicks in)

[Fractal Continuum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EaPDO6pPuE) (hype)

788,"As someone who has a 50 year old dad who has been obese for my entire life I have no sympathy for fat people. All fat people want to do is make excuses about why they're fat when there is only one simple reason behind it, they are greedy. 

My dad has been lucky in the sense that he has never had any major health issues, he's never had a heart attack or a stroke, he's not immobilised or disabled by his weight in any way.

The only reason he (my dad) and this boogie guy and many many others are fat is because they choose to be. This isn't something they're born with, it's not something that was forced upon them. It's something that they chose to do. When you eat 6 meals a day, 6 heaving plate fulls of food plus snacks, more food than any person ever needs to eat in a day then what do you expect to happen? When you sit on your ass all day and never even attempt to exercise, what do you expect to happen?

Fat people are much like drug addicts in that the people around them constantly offer support, constantly try to help them but these people never want to help themselves. And it's not because they can't, or because they would suffer. It's because they are completely lazy. They don't want to work hard. I'll give you a huge tip fat people, just don't eat 6 meals a day, what about that? Just don't eat twice as much as everyone else when we go out to dinner. Just don't eat enough snacks for the whole family while you're in bed trying to sleep. Just walk sometimes instead of driving to shops that are 3 minutes from your house.

And to those of you who know these fatties. Stop pitying them, they don't deserve pity or acceptance. Being fat is not something that was thrust upon them, it was something they actively chose to do. It didn't happen over night, it happened over many many years of gluttony.

Fuck fat people.",2015-12-10 00:04:48+00:00,cxthh61,1,t3_3w44pz,16135,videos

Tokido/daigo, I feel like while daigo can be a bit inconsistent he's quite consistent with shutting tokido down. I do really like tokido tho and to be honest i'd be really happy if he went top 4, 2 or even won.

They are praised and lauded for what they create when more often than not their entire game is a carbon copy of a classic NES/SNES game, usually from Nintendo. 

I have not played Undertale myself, and likely never will but that doesn't stop it from being a good game. What I find silly however is that it's beating these games so outright. If it wins against Fallout 3 it will battle Super Mario World, then Pokemon R/B and then Super Mario 64. The rally it has received through Tumblr has given so many extra votes that it is likely to beat these games and possible win the whole contest.

I enjoyed listening to the show to hear all the crazy stories of a rich guy and even took a lot of his advice to heart. But as I continued to listen week after week I found myself starting to hate Choe. He would tell the same stories over and over, you can hear stories he told as early as the KGB era that he still regurgitates in even the most recent DVDASA episodes. You start to question the legitimacy of anything this man says, does he really live this crazy life or is it all just a show? And then eventually you start to see just how self centred, egotistical and arrogant he is. The way he plays his pawns against each other, manipulates people, belittles them. The final nail in the coffin was the episode of the shittier new series of DVDASA when he was so overly harsh to Bobby Lee. It didn't seem like a joke at all, it reminded me of some school yard antics, where one guy just mocks a guy over and over to make people think he's funny.

People shouting at the top of their lungs no matter where they are. People having no regard for other people, cutting into lines, pushing people. I enjoyed my trips to China and some may say this is racist, but for the most part Chinese people are really rude, selfish, dirty and unfriendly (unless your white).

*Edit: oh yeah and the pollution. Fuck me, I have been to Yiyang, Changsha, Fenghuang, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macau and it's crazy how polluted some places are. In the winter in Beijing the air is like being at a petrol station, it stinks of gas/smoke and it's sometimes hard to see more than a few hundred yards in front of you. On top of the pollution smell you have the stank of all the trash/street food that stinks like literal shit (stinky tofu i'm looking at you). Not so nice.

I invited her to my house and we spent the day watching movies in bed and drinking beer, the whole time I was waiting for the chance to get it in her. Finally we were lying on my floor in the dark and I started kissing her, got naked, put on a condom and stuck it in her. Lasted a couple minutes before rolling off her and immediately texting all my friends that I'd lost my virginity, during the whole thing and afterwords we didn't say a word to each other because I felt embarrassed and truthfully I wasn't even attracted to her.

2094,"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.

I am 23 years old. I have played every single Metal Gear game on release since Metal Gear Solid ('98, PS1). I first discovered the series through my dad. He bought MGS1 and over the course of a few weeks, he, my brother and I would sit there every night as he played through the game. I remember thinking it was the best game I had ever seen. The story, the voice acting, the characters, the music, the graphics. It was perfect. From that point on we would always pick up the games on release and play through them, ever new title bringing heaps of interesting elements to the ever expanding lore.

So in 2012 when the first hints, teases and trailers started dropping for a new Metal Gear we collectively shit our pants. Over the next 3 years we clamoured for any and every drop of information about the game. And if Kojima knows how to do anything well, it's tease us. Every single trailer that came out was better than the last. Every time we heard new information about the game it just sounded more and more perfect. This was it, the missing link, the back story behind the franchises most mysterious character. We were finally going to discover how Big Boss turned from a lovable hero into a detestable villain. It was perfect.

At this point I was literally counting the days, they'd finally dropped that it was coming out on September 1st. Every single fucking hour of my life was spent waiting, painfully, for the game to finally be in my hands. And then finally, it was. About 5 days before release I got the game, it felt surreal, I couldn't possibly be holding it in my hands. All the drama between Kojima and Konami, knowing for a fact that this would be the last time in my life I play a new Metal Gear made by Kojima. I popped it in my PS4 and I played endlessly. 5 days of non-stop playing. Every moment, taking it all in. It started so well, I was so excited. The Hospital Scene was breathtaking, one of the greatest moments in gaming I have ever experienced. And then, as things progressed I started to feel a little disappointed, like the story wasn't fulfilling...

Skull Face, this sadistic psychopath presented to us in Ground Zeroes was hardly present, maybe 3 times we encountered him. And suddenly, before I knew it, in some ridiculous fashion, he was squashed by a falling piece of metal. Credits roll. ""No that can't be it, there's more surely"" and I was right. CHAPTER 2! Oh my god, there is more! 

So here we go into Chapter 2, and what's this? Replay old missions with higher difficulty? Erm, I don't want to, I want to continue the story...Eventually we reach Shining Lights, great mission, killing those singing soldiers, great. A Quiet Exit, awesome cutscene, oh this mission is quite annoying but I want to see the story. Oh Quiet, the one single character who has had any development in the past 50 hours, she's dead now. She's actually gone, I can't use her as a buddy anymore, great. Roll credits, again. I knew it wasn't over, nothing had wrapped up. Where was Zero? ""MISSION 51: TRUTH"". OH SHIT BOYS, DIS GUN BE GUD. Okay, so, oh it's the beginning again...oh...OH, we're not playing as Big Boss...erm...what? I didn't ask for this, no one asked for this...this is Big Boss' descent into evil! Where's Big Boss. So I play the mission, and it obnoxiously is EXACTLY the same as the first mission, down to even containing the tutorial button prompts and everything, same dialogue, same scenes, same gameplay. And then we see Big Boss, he's gone, he just left. 

I sit there, at about 5am after a very long play session alone, just crying. Thinking about how everything this game was supposed to be. All the excitement I had felt leading up to it's release. The way those trailers made me feel. And this is what we got. None of our questions answered, no appearance of characters we were dying to see, David, Zero, Frank, Naomi, BIG FUCKING BOSS, none of it.

I turned of my PS4 and went to sleep. I'd avoided all spoilers up to this point. I bought the Collector's Edition so I thought I'd pop in the DVD to see what that was about. MISSION 51: The Phantom Episode...what? They cut the ending. They cut the ending to the game and put it on a DVD in the CE. I watched it, wow, that looks cool. Why isn't it in the game? Because fuck you ishgardianscrub, fuck you Metal Gear fans, fuck your 20+ years of love for this series and it's lore. FUCK YOU.

I still haven't recovered. Every ~~night, I can feel my leg... and my arm... even my fingers. The body I've lost... the comrades I've lost... won't stop hurting... It's like they're all still there. You feel it, too, don't you? I'm gonna make them give back our past.~~ day, I still think about it. About how I had never felt this level of excitement for anything in my life. That isn't hyperbole, my life is boring, empty, this is a series I have literally grown up with, and this is how it all ends, not with a bang, but with a whimper.

The game is dying because as the community shrinks, the potential income to be made on the game also shrinks which at some point means Konami are paying developers to produce content they're not going to make there money back on. Which in turn means the game will stop receiving support and will then proceed to die entirely.

I have no doubts that the people on MGO community sites are the main people playing the game as the more casual market has better games to play. For example, on Xbox, Halo 5 launches soon which has always been a very popular online game. Next month, many will pick up Fallout 4 which will keep people away for longer, and after that Star Wars Battlefront which is yet another online game that will be better than this. On top of that you have CoD which of course will remove a hell of a lot of potential players. By then, MGO will be an after thought to most people and if substantial changes/content hasn't been introduced no one will return.

Yes, it was a huge disappointment but it is also understandable that it took a long time, but I agree they could have done a lot more than they did in ~5 years.

In regards to MGO, I feel like that whole team was designed for something else. They are potentially the people who are going to continue the MGS saga. This was like their test project. I mean, realistically why would Konami pay an entire extra studio in LA just for a shit-tier multiplayer component to a game that almost everyone who plays (MGS) it doesn't care about?

On top of that a completely broken mess of a game, a beta was needed but it's quite obvious why they didn't do one, no one would have wanted to play this shit if they had a taste earlier on. I don't have anything to back up my claims but I would bet a lot of money that they were just trying to push it out at this point so they can quickly sweep it under the rug. You can tell this by the lack of promotion the game received pre-launch while TPP was advertised to hell and back. Then after TPP launched they continued to remain silent until the game was out.

2780,"It's funny looking at the results of the favourite character section. 

Most people's favourite character was Quiet. Really? Okay, I love tits and ass too, but what is there to like here more than that? Quiet literally has no backstory at all. You are never told, her name, where she comes from, how she came to work for XOF, why she wants to kill big boss, what her past is, why she falls in love with Big Boss other than he's some burly dude who kidnapped her. 

Then we have Venom. Why the fuck would anyone think this guy is the best character (not that there is one) he literally speaks a handful of times and at no point does he add anything to a scene of any relevance. He is as empty and emotionless as any player made character in any game. 

Then Ocelot? Seriously, besides the other games in the franchise that actually gave us reason to like Ocelot, what did MGSV do to add on to Ocelot, further develop him? Scratch that, tell me one thing Ocelot even did in this game apart from spew pointless tutorial-esque shit into our ears every 5 seconds. 

Then Huey, oh fuck, a character in MGSV who actually shows some kind of emotion, motivation and development. Huey was the only fucking character in the whole game who ever actually brought anything to the story. Huey gave us new respect for Otacon, Huey was fairly good. 

Skull Face. Ground Zeroes showed us this despicable, sadistic broken man. It promised us so much with this character. And what did we get? We got 3-4 appearances, most of which boiled down to ""Hey, it's Big Boss, you're gonna die now, get him Man on Fire"". And then what, he died, he died like a fucking comic relief villain. Skull Face is as irrelevant to MGSVs plot as he is to the whole series. In 10 years when we talk about the greatest villains of the series, no one will even remember this guy existed. What a waste. 

Oh Kaz. You started so promising, a truly broken, abused man. He wants revenge, he is bitter, he is the driving force behind Diamond Dogs. And then...he just, doesn't do anything, for the entire game, he just whines and whines and whines. He never shows any reason to hate Big Boss until one tiny post credits sequence where he randomly says he hates him. 

Code Talker. Besides being and endlessly spewing sack of bones about vocal cord parasites, who is he? What does he bring to this game? Nothing. Fuck you and fuck your Diné. 

Eli. Oh god...of all the characters in a Metal Gear game to see no development, they chose one of the most important, underdeveloped characters to completely shit all over. In MGS1 all we here from Liquid is how much he detests Big Boss, how much Big Boss's time with Liquid had made him the villain he became. And what does MGSV do with Eli? We here him speak, in his cheesy British accent maybe 3 times. We see him do some naughty things. And that's it. Not one scene where Venom even directly speaks to him. Nothing. What a terrible set of characters.

Quiet 38.8%

Venom Snake 22.3%

Ocelot 14.6%

2782,"What bothers me the most about the disappointment of MGSV is how everyone I have seen is giving Kojima a free pass. It's all ""FUCK KONAMI, YOU RUINED KOJIMA'S VISION!"". Sorry, but I don't agree. Sure, due to budget constraints, it's quite blatant that development was cut short and much of the later half of the game was removed. But was Chapter 1 good? Because I don't think it was. I think almost every aspect of this games story was terrible and that has nothing to do with Konami. 

Kojima wrote, directed and left his touch on every aspect of this game. None of the new characters were interesting or developed. They lacked backstories, motivation for their actions, emotional investment and any character development throughout the game whatsoever. Many fans had a certain expectation of what this games story would entail. Nobody, and I mean literally nobody on earth who is a Metal Gear fan asked for this story. EVERYONE wanted the story about Big FUCKING Boss descending into villainy. That's it, that's all we wanted. We could have been given 10 hours of well directed, linear gameplay with a cohesive, MGS lore relevant story but instead we got 100+ of bloated ""open world"" gameplay with sparse, poorly told story.

This is not the game that fans wanted. This is not the game fans expected from the man who created 28 years of thrilling story telling.

I think when the dust settles and we've all had a good few weeks to break it all down and process the game's story, many of us are going to feel disappointed. Maybe it's just my opinion, but this game's story did not reach the peaks of any of the previous games. It is by far the worst storytelling of all the games, including Peace Walker. The tone is great, and the cinematography of the cutscenes is really really good, but the actual content of them is so spread out and minuscule that it really kills it for me. I am only on mission 31 so I still have some left to experience but knowing the true ending was cut has already diminished some of my hype to finish it off.",2015-09-06 03:40:07+00:00,cus60xr,3,t1_cus5ob5,799,metalgearsolid

A little backstory for those who don't know:

If you bought GZ physically on release (PS4 / UK) you received a slip of paper in the box that says some like ""Mother Base Staff Code"" this code is for PSN. When trying to enter the code before Sept 1st it said it wasn't valid. Many people said ""wait until release"" so we did. Come release it still doesn't work. So I emailed Konami support asking about it, they told (paraphrasing) ""We don't deal with these codes, please contact Sony to resolve your issue. Also please check out MGO on October 6th."" That's what it said basically. Just completely brushed me off instead of actually facing up to the blatant fact that the codes do not now and will not ever, actually work.

People like to throw all this stuff in your face like ""have you levelled every job, have you levelled all crafting and gathers"" etc. That isn't content, it's tedium designed to extend your playtime without any need for SE to provide ACTUAL content. HW was a disappointment, it didn't add a single new type of content. **The game lacks depth in it's systems and breadth in it's variety of content**.

On top of what I just said, I made these kind of topics several times before HW launched discussing my worries about how HW wasn't adding anything new, just more of the same (and not even much more). People always downvoted me and told me I was wrong, quit the game etc. Always becoming hostile when I criticise the game. It's not perfect by any means and I want improvement in the game, not accepting mediocre content forever. One of the biggest things people would say is ""we get these huge new environments"" and I would always say, so what?

3681,"I would hazard a guess to say Arin and the boys in A7X weren't on the same page in terms of what they like musically. Arin is a fair amount younger than them and just looking at the band Arin came from (Confide) I would imagine his personal tastes were quite different to the classic metal (Iron Maiden, Metallica, Black Sabbath) that A7X are inspired by.

No offence to Arin but this news doesn't really bother me, as we never got to know him like we have the rest of the band. What does worry me is that A7X will never find a new permanent drummer and they will continue this cycle of using new drummers for each following album. I would like to see them find someone who really riffs with the band and is a good fit but I have no idea. Joey Jordison comes to mind as I always thought his and Jimmy's styles weren't too dissimilar. 

We can only hope that this news doesn't impact the progress of a new album and they'll still be on track to hit the studio this year. A7X album cycles have always been long (3-4 years) but if they're going to spend ages searching for a new drummer before even hitting the studio we might be waiting for a while. It's a shame because Hail to the King, while a great album, was really not as memorable or interesting to listen to over and over like their previous works. I'm hoping the new album can tap back into their older style and bring us something heavy yet experimental and new. 

Guess we'll have to wait and see.",2015-07-23 18:26:32+00:00,ctdmvbh,1,t3_3ec59t,8112,avengedsevenfold
