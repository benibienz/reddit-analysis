We got BT Infinity 2 Fibre Optic Broadband about midway through 2015 and so far it hasn't really had any issues. We get about 50mbps down and 10mbps up most of the time. For a while our Home Hub kept messing up but we got it replaced for free and since then had no issues at all.

So that brings us to the past couple days. For whatever reason our internet is fucked right now. We are getting speeds MUCH lower than we should be, it's been as low as 1 down and &lt;1 up at certain times the past few days. 

I called BT up yesterday to complain and after being on hold for 30 mins I spoke to a non-english gentlement who assured me there was nothing wrong with our line and simply told me to reset the router. Funnily enough the second he told me to do so the speeds were back up to 50 down and 10 up. Shortly after hanging up it was back to shit. Over night it was working fine but right now I'm experiencing the exact same drastic drop in speeds.

* I will be using the PC for gaming obviously. I am happy with 1080p 60 FPS, obviously more is never going to be bad but that's the level I want it to not go below. I want to be able to play FFXIV: Heavensward, upcoming games I want to play are Street Fighter V, Dark Souls III and (assuming it comes to PC) Final Fantasy XV. Generally I don't play a whole lot of new games but I want to be able to run them. On top of that I want to be able to stream while I am playing these games. So **TL;DR Play modern games at 1080p 60fps while streaming.**

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* I live in England so I am going to talk in £s and hopefully the build will be built around the fact I live in England. Maximum I want to spend is £1,000. I am willing to go over that slightly if it's for a good reason but want to stick pretty tightly to £1,000.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* As soon as possible.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

* I have nothing currently. I use a MacBook Pro and my phone for all my internet needs and play games on PS4, so I will need every single part of the PC.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* England, West Midlands.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* I own a HD (720p) TV with a HDMI port which I guess could be used as a monitor but it's not ideal. I also own cheap (&lt;£20 Mouse &amp; Keyboard).

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Sorry, I am a noob and don't really know what this means or what it entails.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* I just want to be able to play modern games while streaming without any issues.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* No preferences other than that it will protect the computer and hopefully give it a long life.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* I do, whatever you personally think is the best version to get.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

Hello /r/kappa,

Out of sheer boredom I have gone ahead and made a short survey on google docs to determine just *who is* /r/kappa (you can thank me for the free research /u/fgcdrmike [](/4Head))

The survey covers everything from whether you're obese or not to who you want to bang.

I'll post the results after a reasonable amount of results have been gathered.

P.P.S: I'll try to stop adding new questions to the survey now but if anyone thinks of a good one then let me know and I'll add it in.

So Amiibo are just over 1 year old now. The first ones came out in November 2014. Here we are just over a year later with well over 50 different Amiibo available/coming soon.

Back in the Christmas period last year Amiibo was a craze, people were queueing up for hours, they were sold out everywhere, websites were crashing, sca  lpers were hoarding and prices on reselling sites were very high.

Nowadays it's a lot easier to get a hold of most Amiibo. With older ones being restocked, prices on the older waves falling below the initial retail price the amount of new ones coming out being a lot fewer.

How do you feel about them now compared to 1 year ago? Are you still going strong? Do you have them all? In box or opened? What do you do with them? What's your plan going forward? What do you want to see happen with Amiibo.

Just share your general thoughts on the past year with Amiiibo :)",amiibo,How have your thoughts and feelings changed over the past with Amiibo?,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiibo/comments/3xs2yj/how_have_your_thoughts_and_feelings_changed_over/

Here's the table from my previously stickied topic. As you can see the numbers aren't great: 

* PS4 is fluctuating randomly everyday **+35 since yesterday**. 

* PS3 seems to be trapped and numbers aren't moving for 4 days! 

* XBONE got as low as 37 but is now heading back up to higher than it's been since 26th November.

* XBOX 360 has been trooping on but it seems likely it's impossible to get those last couple dozen Nukes.

* PC somehow is taking out literally hundreds of Nukes everyday despite the fact many PC players claim they can't even find Nuke holding players to invade.

I have never been on board with neverbegameover, they're over presumptuous ""ruse-cruise"" or grasping at straws to try and make any piece of coincidental evidence enforce their delusion.

But tonight, for once, I actually had hope. There were actions leading up this event that actually gave a hint that maybe, just maybe Kojima would appear and make a statement about something, about anything.

I think there's nothing left to be said, the truth that we've known for months have officially been concreted. It really is over. 

After everything that happened leading up to launch, and how the game turned out I was really distressed but when they finally revealed the Nuclear Disarmament event I gained a second wind and found myself desiring to push forward to see what, if anything, was waiting for us.

But now, I just don't care. Anything that happens from now on is just Konami trying to ween whatever remaining money they can out of this game.

Some of you may be aware of the site GameFAQs. They are currently hosting a contest entitled ""Best. Game. Ever"" in which 128 games face off, leaving only 1 winner.

The 128 games were decided by a few weeks of users submitting their personal top 10 games. Every 24 hours new battles begin, battle winners are decided based on user votes. 

Dark Souls has currently made it to the 3rd Round beating out Civ 5 and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It's next battle is against The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. This will be one hell of a tough battle. If Dark Souls loses it will be out of the contest. It would be awesome to see how far Dark Souls can make it in the contest. For me at least, Dark Souls is THE best game of last generation and easily one of the greatest games ever made.

I'm trying to organise some kind of Rally so that it can stand a chance at winning this battle. Other than this Reddit community I don't really know where I could share it to help out. If any of you would like to help in rallying then let me know :)

**You can VOTE HERE: (Dark Souls battle against Link to the Past will begin at 05:00AM GMT on Friday 4th December)**

**TIPS**

We are getting very close to achieving Nuclear Disarmament. I would like to ask everyone who is capable of doing so, to go out there and dismantle as many Nukes as possible. Regardless of platform you can do your part. Here are some tips:

1. If you own a Nuke or are building one, dismantle them as soon as possible.

2. If you know people who own Nukes, message them and explain the situation, you may be able to persuade them to dismantle it without having to steal it from them.

3. For those capable of stealing Nukes, you're already doing great work, don't give up, knock as many of those bad boys out everyday.

4. If you are able to invade a base that owns a Nuke but lack the skill to successfully steal it, consider not invading. By invading a player who holds a Nuke and failing to extract it you are giving that player protection from further infiltrators in the form of a blockade. Consider holding off on invading until you have more practice in FOB infiltrations.

5. While invading a Nuke holder's FOB, destroying anything (UAV Drone, Cameras, IR Sensors) or extracting anything (Resources, Soldiers) as well as killing anyone will trigger a blockade on that players FOB whether you succeed or fail in extracting their Nuke. If you would like to do these things, make sure you acquire the Nuke before you start stealing their staff and resources and causing damage to their base.

6. Try to spread the word of what we are trying to achieve in Nuclear Disarmament to players who might not be aware. Not everyone checks Metal Gear specific Twitter accounts, Subreddits or other sites. Try spreading the word to your friends, family or community through Tweets, Facebook messages, Reddit posts, Twitch streams, YouTube videos etc. The more people become aware of our mission the faster we can achieve it!

**HOW TO EXTRACT AND DISMANTLE A NUKE**

1. First and foremost, in order to infiltrate an FOB that holds a Nuke you **must have 150,000 Heroism**. Owning a Nuke prevents anyone with &lt;150,000 Heroism from invading them. If you would like to boost your Heroism quickly, it is recommended to **farm Mission 23: The White Mamba** and extract all of the child soldiers. This can net you a good chunk of Heroism.

2. Once you have attained Hero status you can head on over to your iDroid and go to ""**FOB Missions**"". There is a tab specifically displaying targets who own Nukes. You will (hopefully) see a list of players who own them. Keep trying to invade them, you can expect to be notified that the player is already being invaded many times.

3. Once you're in, you need to get to the Nuke. The Nuke(s) will be located at the **side of the main Command Platform**. You need to fulton the Nuke in order to extract it. It is not required to complete the FOB mission once you have extracted the Nuke.

4. Next you want to dismantle the Nukes you have procured. It may take some time (possibly several hours) for the Nukes to appear in your ""**Resources**"" tab on your iDroid. From there you can **turn the Nukes into Nuclear Waste** which costs 100,000 GMP per Nuke. Congratulations you have dismantled a Nuke!

**Use this post to track your own progress! Tell us in the comments below how many Nukes you managed to disarm today! If you have any more tips, let me know and I'll add them to this post!**",metalgearsolid,Tracking Nuclear Disarmament,https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/3uv3nn/tracking_nuclear_disarmament/

Now that we can reacquire [Quiet] (/spoiler) and with the recent reveal of how to achieve the Nuclear Disarmament I want to play again.

Legitimately we have received nothing but indie games all year and I find it annoying that people actually defend this and say we don't just get indies every month, because we quite clearly do.

I've had this 50"" Samsung TV for a long time. I did a google search and the model came out in 2007 and I may very have had it since then so it makes sense that it's finally gone bust.

The thing is, it's never actually had any problems at all. Just randomly a week or so ago I turned it on but there was no visuals. You can hear the TV playing but you can't see anything, the screen is just black. And it's not illuminated like there's no input, it's like the screen is completely dead all of a sudden.

Is there any hope for it?

Here's a link to Samsungs web page for the model.

**Dark Souls** had it's first battle against Civ V which it won and will next face off against MGSV:TPP.

**Bloodborne** is currently in it's first battle against FFXII. At the moment it's got ~45% of the votes with 6 hours remaining. If it loses this battle, it's out.

It's just like a pen shape with battery/tank and I put some liquid in it that costs £5 for 10ml.

The problem I have is that I must have gone through 5 of these things over the months. The battery wears out to a point where you have to charge it every couple of hours. The charger is straight up broken. The tank part seems to eventually taste like burning and not the amount of smoke you get out of a ""hit"" is so weak and unfulfilling. In addition, the little bit you put your lips on has snapped off every single one I've bought.

Even though they're cheap (£25 for the whole thing) I've gone through so many that I may aswell just buy a really good one or something that will last forever.

For the most part they are cheaper than anywhere else, deliver products usually by the next working day and preorders often come before official release. All good.

I had Chibi Robo + Amiibo preordered from them for £28.85, the lowest I had found for this bundle. Today I received confirmation of dispatch and account charge. To my surprise I was charged **£34.85**. I called the helpline to ask why the price was raised and they told me it's because of DPD next day delivery. The problem is, I didn't ask for DPD next day delivery, they applied it to the order without my consent.

Many of us, after just over 2 weeks are growing tired of what MGO3 has to offer both in terms of content and gameplay experience. In the future, we hope to see more maps, more game modes and new equipment to make our experience more varied and interesting.

What worries me, is that all that ""new content"" isn't going to be free. I mean, realistically, why would it be? Other games charge ~£40/$50 for a ""Season Pass"" of map packs. Let me just say I **hate** this practice, but that is the modern day games industry.

I feel like the fact they are charging us for minor cosmetic items when the game offers so few in the first place indicates that nothing they put out will be free barring patches to ""fix"" the game.

So I'm asking you, MGO community, if they do charge us to play new content are you going to stick around?

Personally I wouldn't. I don't feel happy to pay for new content when they game itself is so lacking content wise. I also think charging for maps will divide the already small community into such small groups that it will die even faster.",mgo,"If new content (maps, modes, weapons, items etc.) isn't free, will you continue to play the game?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mgo/comments/3ps5gs/if_new_content_maps_modes_weapons_items_etc_isnt/

By the end of 2015 there will be around 90 Amiibo on the market with more sure to be announced in the coming months.

So, I want to have a discussion with all of you Amiibo fans. Where do you see the future going with them? Nintendo will discuss it's plans for their next home console (NX) in 2016 with a launch likely to follow in 2017. Do you think that the NX will support Amiibo in the same capacity as the Wii U? As far as we know the 3DS isn't going anywhere anytime soon but have Amiibo really been a focus on that platform?

By the end of 2016, how many new Amiibo do you think will have been announced/released (not including the ~90 we already own/know of)?

Personally, I think we can all see very easily how successful Amiibo have been for Nintendo. Wikipedia claims they have sold over 14 million Amiibo worldwide. I can't see them stopping to be honest. I think Amiibo will remain a part of Nintendo for the next 5+ years, with every big Nintendo franchise getting plenty of new Amiibo. Just as a completely fictional example, when they run out of ideas they could always create 1 Amiibo (or Amiibo card) for every single Pokemon, which is well over 700 new Amiibo.

They are related to actual user experience, they are problems that are inhibiting players from having an enjoyable time playing this game. Things like lack of host migration, game breaking lag, frequent disconnects, game crashes. 

I check Robert Allen Peeler's Twitter and Metal Gear Online's Twitter frequently and since release (and pretty much forever before) they  have been very quiet in regards to the actual game. They are just retweeting compliments and occasionally answering questions about how to redeem DLC. I have not seen any response or comments in regards to an upcoming patch to fix issues or to add additional content to what is frankly a very barebones game.

I do have some hopes for this game despite Konami showing full well they don't have the fan's best interests in mind and the LA team proving they're not the most capable bunch. I want to enjoy this game but they're not making it very easy. I know no one here can tell me a real answer, but don't you also think it's frustrating that they're not really acknowledging that the game is a mess? 

It's worrying to be honest, because if this was any other multiplayer game, the developers would at least be trying to do everything in their power to improve the experience before users get sick and move on. There are countless other (better) multiplayer games out there and coming soon, people need a reason to stick around.

""Best Metal Gear in the series""

""Best stealth game ever made""

""Seamless, organic open world""

""Kojima's Magnum Opus""

**WE ARE NOT DISCUSSING ANY STORY ELEMENTS IN THIS TOPIC. NONE WHATSOEVER.**

I am just wondering. I am a lifelong Metal Gear fan. I started with MGS on PS1 when I was a kid, sitting with my dad as he played, enjoying the epic story. Since then, me, my brother, my dad, we've all played every Metal Gear on release, always been excited to see what happens in this grand story.

I can tell you without a doubt (and I'm sure many of you here will agree entirely) that I have never been as excited for a game as The Phantom Pain. I am 23 and I have been gaming since I was just 3 or 4 years old and I cannot remember being anywhere close to this excited for a game, even previous Metal Gear games.

When my copy finally arrived last Saturday I was so over the moon, I jumped right in and I have not been able to put it down. The gameplay is so fun and addictive. But I have a gripe. I am 45 hours in, 35% overall completion and just about to start Mission 30.

The trailers for this game are without a doubt the most epic, exciting and cinematic trailers I have witnessed for a video game. Each one outdid the last. The music, the dialogue, the scenes shown. Everything was so epic and dark. 

Here I am having played the game though and feeling somewhat dissatisfied. Many story elements are set up in a &lt;1 minute cutscene and then rarely and sporadically returned too. I am about to start Mission 30 (NO SPOILERS) and from the description I feel it's going to be somewhat of a conclusion to some things. Yet I still feel the game is ""setting up"" I don't know enough about the new characters, especially a certain villain. I don't even hate this villain because I feel they haven't done much to make me hate him. On top of the new characters I feel many old characters never discuss what should be very important things. For example, right after the Mission 0 I would expect a long discussion or at least some kind of tapes discussing many things. But there was none, Snake doesn't have a lot to say about being in a coma for 9 years, Ocelot just strolls in and never really explains why he's there. Miller is angry the first time you meet him and again in cutscenes but between that he has nothing to say.

Overall I feel the story set up from the trailers was portraying a much darker, deeper, cinematic story than what the game is actually delivering. I know this may sound harsh, and I haven't calculated it. **But in 45 hours of gameplay I feel I have seen less than 30 minutes of cutscenes.**

Without discussing the story itself. Does anyone, feel the same?",metalgearsolid,(No Spoiler Discussions) Does anyone else feel the trailers made the story elements seem much more interesting that the game actually portrays?,https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/3joj7h/no_spoiler_discussions_does_anyone_else_feel_the/

With Dark Souls III likely launching in March 2016 (Dark Souls II and Bloodborne both launched in March and Dark Souls III is estimated for Q1 2016) that gives us a 7 month window to expect the DLC to drop, as I would expect they want it out before Dark Souls III as to not overshadow it.

What upcoming events could we possibly see it revealed at? My first guess would be Playstation Experience, but that's not until December which would leave only around 3 months until Dark Souls III.

I've ordered the CE from GAME.co.uk. I used to use GAME (a couple years back) for everything as it would ALWAYS come the day before release, then things started coming AFTER release and I moved off them. But the CE was only available from GAME so I'm worried it won't arrive by next Tuesday.

I normally buy all my games from ShopTo because in my experience every single game I've preordered from them has come the day before release and it's always slightly cheaper than other places. I have also ordered the Day 1 Edition from ShopTo (for my brother) so hopefully that arrives before Tuesday.

The problem is, Monday is a bank holiday which means nothing is going to ship/dispatch/arrive on Sunday or Monday. Meaning the earliest it could arrive is Saturday but then it would have to be dispatched on like this coming Thursday.

I've made a few topics a few weeks back about how it was strange we hadn't seen anything so close to release. Then the news of the delay came.

I just think it's quite clearly not going well with development, hence why the game hasn't been shown at all (out side of a single, scripted trailer).

Here are some of my worries:

* The game is not being developed by Kojima Productions, but instead a team in LA who did not work on MGO2.
* The game has not been shown in a real time capacity, no gameplay demos whatsoever.
* There has been, and likely won't be a beta test.
* No one is talking about MGO, news sites, Konami, Kojima, no one is talking about it.

My biggest worry, is that the development really isn't going well and they're going to push the game out in whatever state they can and that will be it. With Kojima Productions likely disbanding, MGO may see no further development after launch, events, patches, extra content etc.

I know some people don't care that much about MGO and that's fine.

Personally, while MGS is my favourite game franchise of all time, it still remains a fairly niche one. I can count on 1 hand the number of people I know in real life who even know what MGS is never mind having played the games. With the large amount of lore related baggage each title carries it can seem very inaccessible to people wanting to get into it for the first time.

I don't have any official source for the sales figures but I know that in 2013 Konami had a press release that stated the entire franchise as a whole has only sold 33 million units.

Does anyone else find it very disappointing? I would love, ideally if they could perhaps record a single game in MGO including all the LA team, narrated by someone.

This is really pissing me off but the AI keeps scoring own goals. I've seen it happen on my own and the opposing team. I'm not talking about accidents while we're all fumbling around near the goal, I'm talking about where the whole teams down one end and then the AI gets a straight shot at it's own goal and just ploughs it in.

2) Some times it seems like I am going through the ball without touching it, like clipping. Sometimes it's like genuinely on top of me as I go under it and it doesn't react whatsoever.

3) This is one isn't a huge gripe but it's kind of stupid. It's so FUCKING easy to score goals right at the start. I just scored 6 goals in a row in 1 game all from the start. You just speed at the ball and knock it in, goes straight over the other team and into the goal, every time.",RocketLeague,Few issues with the game.,http://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/3chlr4/few_issues_with_the_game/
