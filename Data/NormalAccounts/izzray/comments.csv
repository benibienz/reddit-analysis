120,"June 2nd 

Tried to patrol dz 06. Killed an npc and got a green cache.

Went down to dz 04 extract. Found two players. Told them I'm with the dzpd and was here to protect them. They killed me and took my green.

Went back to dz 01 and started farming.

Saw two players being bullied by two new rogues. Decided to engage. I call out to the rogues ""Halt! I am a dzpd officer on patrol and this type of bullying is frowned upon. Cease and desist or I will be forced to respond with adequate force.""

Turns out they were a four group drawing people in by going rogue on each other.

Office down. They killed me and took my loot.

Saw them extracting at the nearest extract. DZ 01 south west.

As they loaded my things onto the rope I thought about cutting it and taking it back. ""Wait,"" said my conscious ""is this who you are? Would you forsake all your morals and values as a dzpd officer, cut the rope and disavow your solid creed to fight rogues? Becoming the same kind of evil doer you signed onto the force to protect innocents from?""

In that moment I realized I was wrong for considering cutting the rope. I waved to the four group as they were extracting. They killed me and took my keys and dz funds.

I spawned back into the check point and thought about another successful day patrolling the dz. Sure I may have gone down once or twice, but my incredible moral victories will be what the players I encountered today will always remember.

Take that rogue scum.
