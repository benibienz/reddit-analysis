I think both these arguments have validity. You shouldn't press 1 button and get end game gear but you should have a way to progress to it.

Right now end game gear comes in two ways. Incursion and 204 weapons/bp. (This is considering gear sets and not basic gear as end game, though savage gloves and reckless chest I think are best in slot, until they patch reckless)

The issue I see here is you get 1 chance a week for a 240 drop. In a game with stat roll rng that is no where near enough. If you don't do challenge mode you have 1 chance for a 214 drop. 

The issue here is this. I've gotten to 230k/71k/19k at gs 190. As a player I'm not fully endgame yet, and to advance literally all I can do is the incursion. Already did my weekly so I can only get the basic drops.

The problem with this is your stats are so integral to how you fare in this game. You will get steamrolled by players and npcs until you get decent gear. In pve this is very important. In pvp this is mandatory.

What I propose is multiple pathways to endgame gear. The chance to farm pieces over and over if you really need a good roll to succeed. There needs to be more places endgame gear drops or can be inquired to supplement the incursion.

I would say or you can raise the weekly time gate for drops in the incursion netting you 4 drops a run but tbh the incursion is a chore even after you get it down and can run it consistently. The only mechanic is place the bomb and the rest is hiding in a hole. I don't have fun any time I complete it.

This is my destiny tracker page. My overall kd is 1.18. Measly, I feel. I put in a lot of time when I sucked and have had to grind. My monthly kd's on my titan (current main) tell a better story: october 2015 1.29, november 1.33, december 1.66

I've cleared the oryx fight in hard mode 4 times so far, mostly with pick up groups, and I've come today to talk to you about a strat that is destroying fireteam runs from the inside out. Let me, rephrase. I've come to talk to you about an epidemic. A plague. A god awful bane on our destiny community.

The ""no knight"" strat.

Browse LFG or R/fireteams right now and you will see requests specifically for this strat. Some people don't even want to fight oryx without using this strat. Some people want to name their children after this strat.

It's not that good.

""But noooo pro_altitude the no knight strat is the safest most best strat all time that there ever has been! We beat it after only 500 wipes and I got my first 311 auto rifle!""

Stop. You've been led astray. You've been told to worship of false ideology of unfulfilled promises. Let me explain.

Let's start with why people like the ""No Knight"" strat. 
Here it is:

- ""I don't have to shoot/kill as many things.""

That's it. People like this strat cause they don't shoot 4 knights. Which actually causes even more problems but I'm gonna get to that further down. People like this strat cause you don't have to keep track of as much. I get it. You want an easy clear. You aren't making anything easier by running this strat. You're actually making it more difficult.

I'm going to present the problems with this strat and then, once we've called this cancer to the game what it finally is, I will describe the strat you should be running, and why in comparison it is superior.


PROBLEM #1: YOU ARENT KILLING THE OGRES

What does an ogre do when it's not dead? It shoots at guardians. What does an ogre do when it's low health? It shoots faster.

Look at your platform. Do you see any cover? Do you see a walk you can crouch behind? No. It's fucking open season on your ass. You don't want extra shit shooting at you. You're letting a threat live. 2 on each side.

Crouch on the back of the platform. There's 2 ogres. If random chance decides to fuck you 2 will shoot at you and you can't cover both. If acolytes eyes spawn as well god help you.

You die. Maybe if you're a sunsinger you res. If not you wipe. If your res wasn't up you wipe. This was avoidable. You just fell victim to the no knight strat.


PROBLEM #2: YOU ARENT KILLING THE KNIGHTS

""But pro, killing knights is work! I don't like work!""

Then you're gonna hate having to do this fight 500 times cause stupid wipes that not killing knights causes.

The idea behind the ""No Knight"" strat is that all 6 guardians are going to down all 4 ogres at the exact same time. You can try countdowns call outs and whatever else. The reality is most of the time the ogres do not all die at the same time. The fireteam is a single sentient being with 6 heads. It's 6 seperate people. People are gonna kill the ogres at unexpected times no matter how you count it down because people can't all share a brain. If 3 people see one ogre has extra health and think ""I'll just weaken him a bit more"" and all shoot at the same time the triple unexpected damage can kill it. This happens a lot.

WHY THIS IS BAD

The knights still spawn. If you down the ogres at a staggered pace the knight will spawn, run into a bomb and detonate it before you can get there. Maybe even 2 bombs. You will miss bombs in this strat.

When you miss bombs the runs goes long. When the run goes long there's more chances to mess up. If the run goes too long oryx will enrage and it will cause a wipe. Missing bombs is bad. No Knight strat pretty much always misses bombs.


PROBLEM #3: YOUR 4 DETONATORS MUST JUMP INTO A HELL PIT OF ABSOLUTE SHIT TO GET THEIR BOMBS

Acolytes. Acolytes eyes. Centurions. Thralls. Oryx. These are all things that can kill guardians. All 4 guardians will be in the muck for a good 10 unprotected seconds and OFTEN OFTEN OFTEN people will die. This will cause a wipe.

OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU DIDNT KILL??? THE KNIGHTS.

They have swords and going straight for you in your bombs in addition to all the shit I listed that was already trying to kill you.

Guardians die. Oryx doesn't. Team wipes.


THIS CONCLUDES THE PROBLEMS WITH THE NO KNIGHT STRAT


""But pro, you're being a pessimist. You're taking our goose that lays golden eggs of oryx completions and poking holes in it. YOu're just making it worse!""

No mother fucker I'm gonna give you a better strat, chill.

Here's what you should be doing: Killing every ogre and every knight.

There is a strat that makes this easy and achievable and multiple reasons why this will ultimately work and be fool-proof. Explaining now.

1 runner. 3 platformers. 2 floaters. Your floaters will be titans. Here we go.

Runner: Do your runner thing. You jump so good. Damn. What an A+ fireteam member.

Floaters: You are titans. You will have blessing and weapons of light. 1 for each of you. You will stand between the 2 daughters platforms with touch of malice and pop both. You will proceed to rek 4 ogres in the face. I actually love this part of the strat. You feel very powerful reking 4 ogres as soon as they stand up.

Platformers: You will take postitions 1, 2 and 3. 1 is where oryx slams. 2 is the platform counter clockwise from 1. 3 is the platform counter clockwise from 2. You will change platforms everytime oryx moves.

Next shoot the ogres next to your platform until he dies. Then look across the gap for the knight that spawns. This is your knight. Kill him too.

Runner will now call that he has relic, and you can safely leave your platforms. Run directly to the titan bubbles and wait until the aura of safety arrives.

FLOATERS, you are responsible for the 4th knight. Kill it now.

Next Oryx will slam and open. Team shot til he staggers.

AFTER HE STAGGERS DO NOT RUN IMMEDIATELY FOR BOMBS. Take the 30 seconds you have and shoot the adds on the front and back side of the arena till all centurions, acolytes, and acolytes eyes are down. 

Once those adds are clear someone can call to go to bombs. 1 floater will be responsible for the 4th bomb. Everyone go detonate bombs, get back to safety in the aura and shoot oryx.

Run from mines or kill shade accordingly.

Boom shoot oryx dead yay done.

This is the best strat for killing oryx.



In time I genuinely believe the no knight strat will go away, but for now it needs to become more widespread and known why this isn't the strat you should run. It puts a lot of extra chances for wipes that aren't under your control into the mix and it will baffle and frustrate you and turn fireteams against each other. Instead use the better and ultimately easier strat I've detailed in this post.

Oryx isn't that hard. You can kill him.

Go well guardians,

- pro out

(this is the longest post I've written in my life)

edit: I'd like to add one thing. yes you can technically beat it with many strats and or rock band drums. slayerage four-maned it already. the point of this post is to address problems with the strat 1 that make it much less efficient than strat 2. don't make it harder on yourself if you're having trouble. this post is based on experiences with 10+ groups. yes I tried the strat I'm talking about and that's how I know these problems exist and wiped us a lot. the main problem I see is no knight is the predominant lfg strat, and that's gotta change bros. most lfg groups need all the help they can get right now. the front page post today with this strat in it is better. if I had seen that post I may not even have written this. in time it will become the predominant strat and no knight will fizzle out.",DestinyTheGame,"The Plague of the Oryx Hard Mode ""No Knight"" Strat and Why It Must Be Stopped",https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3qm617/the_plague_of_the_oryx_hard_mode_no_knight_strat/

I'd like to offer 2 short counter points to this.

The first is the most obvious. This is their fireteam. They can do what they want with it. You don't have to join it. If it's really a problem you can even make your own fireteam. I know crazy huh?

The second is a bigger issue. This is revolving around the king's fall raid. I've been in groups that have finished the raid, and I've been in groups that have failed. I know what it takes to beat the raid, and how this raid differs from simpler raids before it.

The key difference between king's fall and past raids is now, at least at oryx, every single member of the fireteam has a job. Yep. All 6 people hold 6 necessary positions. It takes 6 competent guardians.

In Crota and VOG the battles were set up so that if one person did very well another could slack and the team could ultimately still achieve it's goal. Bungie specifically set out to make sure that wasn't the case in the new raid. People complained about being able to solo Crota. ""That's not a raid."" They said. Bungie listened, and we now have king's fall.

The thing that ultimately disappoints me about this is if you are a good player you will have no problem finishing the raid. 5 people in one group will not stop you. You will find a group of equally talented guardians and you will succeed because you can do what needs to be done. When someone has a problem with fireteam requirements being that someone can know the fight and perform, who does that blame ultimately rest on? All they're trying to do is complete the raid. As we all are. It takes work to do.

So I leave you with this. Please think about this backlash. No everyone doesn't need to be 310. Does being 290 affect damage done on oryx?Yes. Yes it does. Consider all the factors. Join groups that are right for you, and enjoy playing the game.
