jonpak here to offer some coaching for anyone! My blurb can be found on my dotacoach.org page. I would like to offer free 1 hour sessions with people just so you guys can see if you want me as your coach or not. I coached a few people with 100% positive feedback so far!

**Why would you choose me over other people?**

I personally have real world teaching experience which can translate into teaching people about dota.

Find me at [dotacoach](https://dotacoach.org/jonpak) and we can chat !

Thanks for taking a look at my post guys.

Looking forward from here from you!
