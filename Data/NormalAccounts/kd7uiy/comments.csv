&gt; 21.1.4 	
&gt; Adoption and Foster Care
&gt; 
&gt; Members who are seeking to adopt children or provide foster care should strictly observe all legal requirements of the countries (and their governmental subdivisions) that are involved. They are encouraged to work through licensed, authorized agencies.

Also somewhat related is the following, from https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/families-and-the-church-in-gods-plan?lang=eng#1.3.3

&gt; All members, even if they have never married or are without family in the Church, should strive for the ideal of living in an eternal family. This means preparing to become worthy spouses and loving fathers or mothers. In some cases these blessings will not be fulfilled until the next life, but the ultimate goal is the same for all.

24,"Absolutely! You can specify age preferences, number of kids, temporary/ desire to adopt, etc. You can specify being a home that they will drop kids off for a few days until they have a more permanent situation as soon as the kids enter, to only kids entering adoption, and anything in between. There is also respite care, where you have kids for anywhere from a day to a week to give the foster care parents a chance to de-stress or otherwise take care of something they couldn't do otherwise. Basically, the foster care system is in so much need of help that, within reason*, they will take what they can get (* Assuming you can pass a background check, and are willing to take the classes, meet safe home requirements, and otherwise meet the requirements of being a foster parent)

That being said, there is generally speaking more need for people willing to take in older kids, with special needs, and who are interested in being involved in the entire process from start to possible adoption if it comes down to it. Most of the time they want people who will be willing to be their home for at least 6 months, although people who are willing to take a kid at any hour of the day for a few days to weeks is extremely helpful as well. They also prefer people who are willing to take in multiple kids at a time, especially sibling groups.

For me, we started with an informational meeting that was held once a month in the city that I then lived. Look around for your specific area, there usually is an open house of some kind or anther discussing such things on a regular basis, especially if you live in a reasonably large city. They will explain the process, including training, home inspections, and placements in your home.

There's also something called a CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) that you could do, essentially you would become something like a Big Brother/ Big Sister, sticking with that kid or family throughout their entire foster care process and possibly beyond, but you wouldn't be responsible for them on a day to day basis.

Lastly, if you want to, you could contact a local foster care agency and simply express the desire to help out kids in need in the program. I pretty much guarantee if you offered to do something like, say, purchase Christmas presents, pay for an extra-curricular activity, buy new cloths, etc, they'd be more than happy to talk to you!",2016-11-11 15:12:14+00:00,d9vw6w2,5.0,t1_d9vv1oc,1705.0,AskReddit

* CD- You can't access it immediately, but it will give you a higher rate than savings. Most of your money here would be a good thing. You can touch it, but it's not easy, so it might be a good idea for saving for later years.

I'm not really thinking of a fully customization ship, just the interior of a ship. So there will be a number of ship designs. When you get it, you can set up the inside how you want to within reason. Right now I have a side view of each level of the ship. I've found there to commonly be 3 levels, the top of which usually only has the Captain's cabin and maybe another thing or two, the middle has the kitchen, crew quarters, and some cargo, and the bottom has almost entirely cargo.

139,"Culture comes from a lot of things. In this case, there's a number of things that it could be coming from. These include the following:

Many activities that many people partake in are different than those that people outside of the church do. Drinking, dating at earlier ages, pre-marital sex, all have their role, and it's easier to obey these things if those around you are. This doesn't mean to shun those who have different beliefs, but to be careful about who you hold in your innermost circles. This is taught, and could be the reasoning behind everything you mention. For the exact teaching, see https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/friends?lang=eng . ""As you seek to be a friend to others, do not compromise your standards. If your friends urge you to do things that are wrong, be the one to stand for the right, even if you stand alone."" is perhaps the most direct quote about such teachings. However, I believe the church encourages friendships among those who aren't members, especially as they keep the standards that the church has set out.

Historically, Mormons have been very persecuted. This could lead to some extent to a general mistrust of outsiders, passed down through the generations. No proof of this, mind you, but it could be the case.

Also, there are a number of activities throughout the week, especially for high school and college aged students, that are for those ages. Many friendships are formed through those activities, which naturally leads to more connection with those who also participate in such activities, and perhaps less with those who don't.",2016-08-29 18:06:29+00:00,d71hr1o,9.0,t1_d71f3lw,3398.0,IAmA

147,"There it is!

After 5 long years, at last we are about to arrive to investigate the mystery. Soon, humanity will know. 

It all started that fateful day, 5 years ago, when the Mars Water Radar continually was receiving strange results over a particular area on Mars. Eventually, a radio transmitter was found. No lander was known to have attempted to land there, however. Photographs were soon taken, and a large structure was observed, clearly steeper than any natural object is on Mars. The object was about 10 meters across, and from the shadows, about 30 meters tall. No one could offer an explanation for that object. Eventually, it was decided that humanity must visit it, in person.

It grows larger, as you decent. All you can tell is that it is as tall as was expected, but dust covers it up, hiding it from view. You continue on your rover trip to visit the mysterious object, having confirmed that it is still emitting radio waves. Wait, you see something odd, it looks like a solar panel, near the top, is slightly uncovered. That might be the power source for the radio waves! But strange, it looks, well human.

The object, with no explanation, was thought to be of alien origins. The people of Earth demanded answers The Mars Intrepid rover was sent, but it wasn't able to get close enough to the object to get any answers. It was decided a human mission must be sent. 

As you approach the object, you notice something buried in the ground nearby, flapping. You approach it, and get out of the rover. It looks almost like cloth. It is very fragile, with many holes in it, but it clearly was a rectangle, and might have been a dark red color, with another color you can't identify in the dust. It reminds you of a flag.

You continue on foot the rest of the way to the artifact. It appears to be rusted, almost as if it was made of steel. Who would make a spacecraft of steel, given the power to come to this planet? You circle round the artifact. You then notice something even stranger. There is a ladder. You decide to ascent it. On your way up, you knock off some loose dust, and then you see it, a Soviet flag. Wait, a Soviet flag? This object was human, and old. Confused, you decide to enter.

Entering, you see something is amiss from the beginning. A thin black film covers everything. Going further inside, you notice a burned panel, it is evident a fire burned the console. Still, you see nothing else amiss.

Finally, you decide to look around a bit more. You notice a small mound a few feet away. You decide to investigate. It's a body! You quickly dust it off. In it's hand, you see a note. ""Landed on Mars. The spacecraft stopped working. I couldn't communicate with Earth. After running out of food, I die here, on Mars, looking up to the Sky.""",2016-08-16 23:05:27+00:00,d6kdvaa,1.0,t3_4xzr87,31159.0,WritingPrompts

262,"Your problem (I suspect) is that you don't actually do anything if the player's health is below 0 during his turn. You never actually check to see if the player is alive before awarding the win. The player must be alive to win. It is only checked at the end of a round. I made the same change to my code, with your input values, and had the same problem you did.

There's a couple of ways to do this, I personally use a script very similar to yours, with the exception of checking if player health &gt;1 for the while loop for hard mode.  My code tells me your optimal value is around 1300, FYI. I think you could also do it by checking to see if the player's health is greater than 0 for a victory condition.",2015-12-25 04:10:49+00:00,cyaofng,1.0,t3_3y4nql,17692.0,adventofcode

270,"My approach was fairly simple, although it took me some time to come to the conclusion. It was based on a few insights:

1. The time in which the 3 effect spells is cast doesn't matter much (Aside from not happening at the same time, and to ensure there is mana/health.
2. The number of drain also doesn't matter.
3. Magic missiles effectively are a default.

So basically what I did was write a script that first used regenerate if required, then poison, then shield. It would cast these in specified numbers (IE, one round would only allow 2 poison spells to be cased). If I ran out of mana, I assumed my path was poor.

This didn't require any complex logic, and in fact simplified things quite a bit. Most of my logic was to show the effects of the spells, and keep track of the mana, which I probably could have done better if I tried harder. The code is somewhat ugly, but to test only requires 375 test battles, not bad at all.
