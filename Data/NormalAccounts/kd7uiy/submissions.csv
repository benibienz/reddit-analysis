And by far it was the hardest one so far, as the stats will attest. I started Part 2 with a solution that probably would have worked, but like many, I found it better to work from the input back to e than the reverse. Also, I was beating my head for about 40 minutes, seeing my run take forever, then I made the very small simplification of sorting the list by length, and testing the long pieces first. Lastly, the exhaustive solution probably isn't needed to fully answer, if you get a guess by this manner, try it, it might just work. My program was far from finished, but I tried the first answer that came, and had success. Needlesss to say, it worked much quicker then, allowing me to finally get to sleep.

I'm personally having some serious difficulties getting the 7th code (Teleporter). So far I've figured out the following:

1. I have taken the assembly code in the function and written my own varient of the code, which seems to work.
2. I tested a few cases of r7 (Along with custom starting r0 code), which allows me to do testing.
3. I have a method for shortcutting the verification process, and putting in my own r7 and r0 values such that they pass the checks.
4. I have attempted to optimize the code, by focusing on the number of ones that appear each time that r1 would be set to r7. This seems to follow a consistent logic pattern, which I have attempted to follow. For instance, 3 1 turns into 2 2 2 (Assuming r7=1), although there is more to the pattern than that.
5. I think I know what the out condition is supposed to be (r0=6), by examining the code. I have a function that loops through every r7 value, and figures out what the r0 should be. I'm not sure how accurate my function is, however, as verification would take a very long time to perform even on a few simple types...
6. I then take the r7 value, feed it back into the teleporter program, skip the verification, and have a key that spits out. In fact, I spit out a range, to make sure it comes out right.
7. I've tried several times to enter the code that appears, with no luck.
8. I should also mention that I changed the input condition from r0=4 to r0=3 to do some spot checking of my offline program. It seems to work, but I seem to be missing something still...

What I'd really like to see is a few instances of what r0 should be given r7, to make sure my code is right. I know I'm close, but I'm missing one small piece of the program, so... Any tips?
