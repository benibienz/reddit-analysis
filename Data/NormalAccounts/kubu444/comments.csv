I mean I dont think I could get that high with some crappy xhair placement, but I dont think its very good either. Any recommendations how to get better @ that?",2016-08-28 12:19:45+00:00,d6zvdju,4,t1_d6zv957,336,GlobalOffensive
3,"Well, ppl in esea/faceit tend to go with me and try to trade the kill if i fail the duel. But that never happens in MM, they just get to scared and run back. Or even worse, they wait 10 seconds, enemy throws smoke and then they rush out.  

As CT that is exacly what I am doing, get in an offspot, rush with strange timming, get a kill, drop a flash/smoke and run back to a safe spot. The problem starts when i get tilted, that makes me lose the idea how to play and i try same thing over and over and I cant seem to notice what im doing wrong.

BTW. Is my ESEA/Faceit elo a good representation of my MM rank? I feel like there is a huge gap between those.",2016-08-28 12:02:06+00:00,d6zv0i3,2,t1_d6zurqu,831,GlobalOffensive
