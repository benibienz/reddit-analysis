I have always tried to play that aggresive style of game, since it was working much better for me, I have tried to entryfrag at T, played aggresive corners as CT etc. I have noticed that if it goes good at the beggining of the game I get going and I steamroll my oponents, but I get tilted as eassily and that makes me lose my confidence (I start to play slowly and i suck at that). 

Have you got any advices what should i do/how should i practice (both game and mind wise) to get rid of that flaw?

PS. If you have some neat advices/guides/tips'n'tricks for entryfragging please leave them here aswell ;D",GlobalOffensive,Some help for a lost soul,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4zyx9q/some_help_for_a_lost_soul/

All the opions in CS are set to low, res 1600x1200, all shaders, AAs etc are off. And still i can't get more than 120fps (even when i get 120 it is very unstable). Have you got any tips how to boost that or any ideas what could be wrong with the game?

PC spec:
i5 4570,
2x MSI GTX 760TF (working on SLi bridge, not overclocked),
8gb of ram 1900mhz,
Z87-G45 MSI motherboard,
SSD drive.

All the drivers are up to date, game is working on fullscreen, SLi is active, temp is low (I have just cleaned the PC and changed thermal paste), all other programes are switched off, MSI settings are set to gamming mode (it switches off windows aero packet, boosts graphic card power etc). 
I can get stable 60fps playing Witcher 3 on ultra details, with hairworks active, and the temp never gets above 65C. ",GlobalOffensive,FPS problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4paddd/fps_problem/

Each time i minimize my game and try to make it full screen again the game crashes, no error informations, it just switches off. It doesnt matter what I do when it is minimized, or for how long it is in such state. Before the last update everything was fine. I really need an option to ""tray"" the game.

I used to play Tera some time ago, i still have got warrior on Killian (lv. 60). It was my first character and I was quite good with it. I used to get 1st place on BGs (the one with castle) quite often. Then i stopped playing for some time, today my friend convinced me to start over again, and here stands my question. Is the warrior still any good? I like mobile classes, with high skillcap, hard to play and with big DPS/crits. Can anyone of you tell me if it is worth to play this class or it was nerfed/is not viable in the patch and I should reroll?",TeraOnline,Comming back to game and need some advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/44mm45/comming_back_to_game_and_need_some_advice/
