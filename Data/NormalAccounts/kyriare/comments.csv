Also, the reason why I don't think that someone ""better"" asked her out, is because only a few hours earlier, my friend overheard her and told me (this all happened before me asking her out) that she was talking about how her [female] friend was forcing her to go to it.

Also, why in the world would she fake saying yes? She sounded genuinely happy, looked me straight into my eyes the entire time, and literally pulled me into a hug and gave me her number. Why would she do that and then lie to me? I mean it just makes more sense that she's telling the truth.

So who knows. Fuck. Do you really think she'd have added on that ""we could hang out"" part if she wasn't interested? I mean it did sound like what she would say if that really was what happened. But still...

I don't know. I like to be optimistic. But how would I find out if she really does like me? In a way that doesn't involve texting. UGH. I hate this super anxiety/terribleness I'm feeling.

Idk though, I just feel like she's so unique and that I wouldn't end up asking anyone like her out ever again.

Also, she did say that she has a ton of stress and studying she has to do, so that's probably something that plays into this.

But IDK, I don't want to seem desperate. I really want this to work out. And I'll follow your advice on letting her talk if she wants to.

I'm just a wreck right now. I have a test to study for tomorrow (that I've heard is very difficulty), and I can barely focus on it. I don't want to think about her or it right now but it's all I can think about. It's like full-blown anxiety 24/7 today, and most of yesterday. I can't control it.

But I don't know, how could I push it forward? I really want to at least see if she's interested in me. 

And what makes it even worse is that she drives a car, and I can't (at least not till November/December anyway). This could make things pretty awkward if we were to hang out.

I hate this feeling. It's just terrible. All I wanted to know was an answer for whether she likes me or not. I guess I'll settle on saying hi to her tomorrow then acting based off of that.

Anyway, the thing is, I have no idea what exactly I want to write about. I mean, I'm interested in human nature but I don't even know what kind of aspects I can discuss. Political philosophy would be interesting (as in, who should be able to vote, how should the government be run, etc...), or even metaphysics (it sounds like a cool word though I don't know what it means) but I have no idea if that would be too advanced for me.

So I guess my question is: what do you think would be something good (or eas*ier*) to write about, to the point of being able to write a 3500-4000 word essay on?
