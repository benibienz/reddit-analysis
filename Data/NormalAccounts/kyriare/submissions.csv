Here goes...

So I'm 17 years old and a senior in high school and I'd never asked anyone out in my life. However, month or so ago I decided to do something about that and asked my crush out to homecoming. Mind you, we'd barely talked before though I thought she liked me back. Anyway, she said yes, and I remember that it was a very cheerful yes. However, she texted me an hour later saying she'd forgotten she'd made plans with some friends on homecoming and that she couldn't go with me. As you can imagine, I felt like complete shit.

Well anyway, after a few awkward texts to each other, I kind of just stopped texting her and we kind of just ignored each other in class. This was all a month ago but my brain would not let go of it. I had been imagining that she doesn't like me and that she probably actually kind of hates me because of all that happened. It felt kind of like a loose end and it really weighed down on me.

So a couple of days ago, I went up to her, and basically told her to forget about homecoming and to just be friends. I'd expected her to say something along the lines of, ""Yeah, sure, that sounds great!"" Or something like that, because I really didn't think that she liked me back. Instead, I got something along the lines of ""No no no, don't think that! What happened at homecoming was just a misunderstanding, I had already made plans with my friends and I couldn't leave them"" I didn't really know what to say, but I did manage to respond something like, ""Yeah, but it feels like it's very awkward between us and that even though we have a lot in common we don't really talk that much..."" She responds, again, a little unexpectedly, ""No no it's not awkward at all! Stop overthinking it! It's just a misunderstanding."" And then we had to part ways because we were going to different places.

I have no idea what the fuck to do. I fully expected her to be okay with friend-zoning me basically. But instead, what I got was probably her thinking I'm trying to friend-zone her. That now, I only want to be friends with her and not date her, which isn't true at all. I feel really confused and I don't know what to do...

My plan right now is to just stop kind of ignoring her and actually talk to her again normally like an actual human being. But I _did_ kind of just put up a friend-zone barrier like a fucking idiot and I don't know what to do about it. I don't think that just talking to her normally would change that She probably thinks that I have no interest in dating her now, which is the complete opposite of the truth...

I really want to get to know her (which is why I even asked her to be friends in the first place, I thought we couldn't go any further) and, if possible, date her till the end of senior year (or even further if that's possible...) But I completely fucked up by being pessimistic about things and I don't know what to do. I don't want her thinking that I only want to be friends with her... This is one of those things that keep me turning at night and that I keep cringing about.

Please help me out. I feel like such an idiot.

I've also been slacking off and barely doing anything. And almost every moment is just filled with anxiety, loneliness, and unhappiness. Nothing has been able to make me truly feel happy. Not videogames, not anything. I've also recently contemplated cutting myself in the hopes that it would make me feel better.

Yesterday, I asked out a girl I had a crush on for 4 years to homecoming. I didn't really know her to well. She says yes. Like, an enthusiastic yes. And she gave me her number. So, I thought that she may have actually liked me back.

Then it all starts going downhill. An hour later, she texts me something along the lines of, ""I'm really sorry but I was so excited (because I never thought that someone would ask me out [or something like that]) that I forgot that I had promised my friend to go with him."" and something like she really would've liked to have gone, and something about how we could hang out sometime.

So my hopes are still up.

Then, I try to make conversation with her over text. She responds super slowly (sometimes takes hours) and at one point, I messaged her at around 8 pm and didn't get a response till next morning, 12 hours later, with an excuse that apparently she sleeps super early.

The entire rest of the conversation I feel like I was initiating and she was just responding. And she wouldn't ever initiate it on her own. I last texted her about 8 hours ago and she's yet to respond (it wasn't a question or anything, but still... if she liked me back, wouldn't she text more often or something?)

I really don't know how to feel about this.

But I do know that it makes me feel like utter and absolute shit. I was extremely happy when she said yes, but after I got that text, I really didn't know how to feel anymore.

I really want to talk to her (right now through text), but she doesn't seem like she cares to, seeing as I'm the one who keeps initiating these texts.

Honestly. I just wanted to know how she feels about me. And her response to me when I asked her out seems like proof that she likes me back. Like she seemed really happy and even hugged me and was beaming the entire time. But everything else points otherwise.

I've never asked anyone out before, and she's the only person I like at my school. Really, if this all ends up not working out, I'm not going to try dating anyone else. So I really do want this to all work out.

Also, this is all new to me. I have never asked anyone out before nor texted someone who I actually like.

I feel pathetic because I only did this now in my senior year of high school.

I can't stop thinking about it, and I can't stop thinking about her.

I really want to not think about this entire thing. But I can't. I can't focus on school, I can't sleep well, I can't do anything really. All since yesterday.

I just wanted to know whether she actually liked me back or not. And this makes me feel so conflicted, anxious, paranoid, and absolutely like shit. And so I came to reddit, where I could type out my feelings without worry of being judged because this is all anonymous.

1) Any advice?

2) I have class with her tomorrow, what should I say? Should I just not say anything and pretend like nothing happened? Or what? I wasn't really close friends with her anyway. Or friends in the first place, for that matter. I have had class with her four years in a row though, but we only really talked extensively like once or twice.

3) I'm feeling so low that I would love to just lie down and cry... But I can't and I won't.

4) And lastly, do you think that she actually likes me back? Or am I getting curved?

I really hate this. I regret asking her out in the first place. At least I felt way better about simply wondering whether she likes me or not. But now it's on a whole new level.

Yesterday, I asked out a girl I had a crush on for 4 years to homecoming. I didn't really know her to well. She says yes. Like, an enthusiastic yes. And she gave me her number. So, I thought that she may have actually liked me back.

Then it all starts going downhill. An hour later, she texts me something along the lines of, ""I'm really sorry but I was so excited (because I never thought that someone would ask me out [or something like that]) that I forgot that I had promised my friend to go with him."" and something like she really would've liked to have gone, and something about how we could hang out sometime.

So my hopes are still up.

Then, I try to make conversation with her over text. She responds super slowly (sometimes takes hours) and at one point, I messaged her at around 8 pm and didn't get a response till next morning, 12 hours later, with an excuse that apparently she sleeps super early.

The entire rest of the conversation I feel like I was initiating and she was just responding. And she wouldn't ever initiate it on her own. I last texted her about 8 hours ago and she's yet to respond (it wasn't a question or anything, but still... if she liked me back, wouldn't she text more often or something?)

I really don't know how to feel about this.

But I do know that it makes me feel like utter and absolute shit. I was extremely happy when she said yes, but after I got that text, I really didn't know how to feel anymore.

I really want to talk to her (right now through text), but she doesn't seem like she cares to, seeing as I'm the one who keeps initiating these texts.

Honestly. I just wanted to know how she feels about me. And her response to me when I asked her out seems like proof that she likes me back. Like she seemed really happy and even hugged me and was beaming the entire time. But everything else points otherwise.

I've never asked anyone out before, and she's the only person I like at my school. Really, if this all ends up not working out, I'm not going to try dating anyone else. So I really do want this to all work out.

Also, this is all new to me. I have never asked anyone out before nor texted someone who I actually like.

I feel pathetic because I only did this now in my senior year of high school.

I can't stop thinking about it, and I can't stop thinking about her.

I really want to not think about this entire thing. But I can't. I can't focus on school, I can't sleep well, I can't do anything really. All since yesterday.

I just wanted to know whether she actually liked me back or not. And this makes me feel so conflicted, anxious, paranoid, and absolutely like shit. And so I came to reddit, where I could type out my feelings without worry of being judged because this is all anonymous.

1) Any advice?

2) I have class with her tomorrow, what should I say? Should I just not say anything and pretend like nothing happened? Or what? I wasn't really close friends with her anyway. Or friends in the first place, for that matter. I have had class with her four years in a row though, but we only really talked extensively like once or twice.

Could be anything about human nature, or even on existentiality. I just need a starting point and I'll try to make my way up from there. However, any other, easy to write on subjects within philosophy would work.

Basically, for the IB diploma (kind of like AP and is for highschool, but is available internationally rather than just in the US. Though I do live in the US.) I need to write a 4,000 word essay, and I chose to write it on philosophy. I have to discuss what the philospher believes on the subject and then apply it to something else. However I could be pretty flexible on what I choose to do. The philosophical application could be on anything; a work of fiction (or nonfiction) such as a movie or a television show, even a book or another work of philosophy.

However, I need to have a topic and somewhere to start with. And it needs to last about 3500-4000 words, so it has to be something substansive.

I'm not very educated in philosophy, and I'm using this essay as a way to learn more and explore different philosophical works. Thing is, I have no idea how to even start, and I don't really have that much time everyday to spend on this essay.

I was originally thinking on writing about Kant, however I was told by a teacher that Kant's text is pretty complex and would require lots of work to understand. I was also thinking about Locke and discussing his ideas, however I don't even know where to begin there.

Any sort of help would be very appreciated. Thanks in advance!",askphilosophy,I need a suggestion for what to write on a philosophy essay,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/4iy6pb/i_need_a_suggestion_for_what_to_write_on_a/

I can compare two different works/philosphers, go in-depth and analyze one, etc... i.e. I can get pretty out there on this if I have to.
