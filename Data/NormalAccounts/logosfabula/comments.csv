108,"I'm not American, so I cannot possibly understand all the rules, the habits and the specific symbolic values behind the Memorial Park. But  I can try and relate. 

I'm not a veteran, I'm not a kid either. In my country I took the option to serve as a civil servant when I was drafted, mainly because it was more consistent to my beliefs and I wanted to do something meaningful and helpful in a time when in Italy drafted soldiers more or less just spent 10 months in activities that weren't useful at all. 

I am a gamer and I think that defending constitutional rules is a *duty* that we ought to keep doing, even and possibly more likely so when it takes courage and guts. However.

What strikes me the most is how indifferent are these kids towards the *suffering* these persons had to endure. Not to mention the despise which he says ""old"" with. It's not about being a veteran, it's not about being a good old person. Respect to suffering doesn't have to be *deserved* or *motivated*. These people know it well, because they shared experiences that immature kids don't know yet (do you really think the liberty they fought a war for, the right for which they risked their lives, the values that inspired them to such perils, was something even slightly similar to this?).

It's the values at stake here that make a difference, in my eyes. Playing Pokemon with friends or letting some fragile lives in the end of their days try and find a tiny spot they can call a safe harbour for sparse glances of peace of mind that you probably have and will have in abundance in your long future?

It's about what is more valuable, not who is right.

141,"&gt; I apologize for the vast range of English slang, I needed an insult that rated at about 5 out of 10 for rudeness and bell end is a perfect 5.

I couldn't be this accurate with my repertoire 

&gt;The issue is here in the US there is a battle for what is good and what is legal.

That's the point, although I believe the difference from an Italian point of view can substantially differ from a British one, because (correct me if I'm wrong) both American and British legal system are based on common law - whereas Italian is based upon Roman-Napoleonic. My perception is that deep in the culture of Americans the individual's consciousness takes ultimately precedence over the laws. This speaks volumes to us because it isn't novel to European culture.

We would basically never do something like this, but I appreciate both the police officer and the person for doing this, basically, for the better. Notably, there's a huge difference between, i.e. UK and Italy: in my experience, UK police officers are state of the art (and not only they, but all officers in general and people in general, be it London or Lake District, are exquisitely polite and no-nonsense), whereas in Italy is not always the case. Nonetheless, here, who did something like in this video would be immediately tagged as an exaggerated fussy person and probably an extremist (a harmful individual).

In fact, I would interpret:

 ∃x(S(x) ∧ ∃y(M(y) ∧ ¬A(x, y))) 

as:

*Some students* ***don't*** *love* ***some*** *subjects*.

which I interpret differently than:

*Some students* ***don't*** *love* ***all*** *subjects*.

My competence of English tells me that *not all* is equivalent to *some*, whereas *not some*, in English, has no other equivalent phrase and is almost absent in the natural language, but sounds like an ambiguous way to say either *some* or *not any*.

E.g.: Carl didn't eat some apples. (Did he eat no apples? Did he eat some apples?)

218,"Nice example of gamification. There are a couple of flaws though. The first one regards your use of experience points. XPs (and levels) are cumulative only and cannot be lost. You should devise another idea for that, for instance negative ""buffs"" that hinder XP gain - or simply assign the immediate penalty and that's it. 

Secondly, one of the core principles of gamification theory is to use its techniques in order to reinforce intrinsic motivation and not to produce behaviour change based on an extrinsic motivation. Why? As Gabe Zichermann says: after you substitute intrinsic motivation with extrinsic motivation, as soon as the underlying extrinsic motivation is extinguished, the corresponding behaviour is also extinguished. I'm pointing at the rewards you give to the player, which correspond to the extrinsic motivation. They are (mostly) unrelated to the rationale of your goal as a designer: to have players free themselves from smoking. Reward design is one of the most difficult tasks in gamification. What I mean is that when you quit giving them this kind of rewards they will feel unmotivated to keep playing (and trust me, you must keep playing at the non-smoker game all your life once you have been a smoker, there's no such thing as a free-from-smoking status, it's a condition you have to deal with forever). You should instead devise rewards that reinforce the instrinsic motivation of quitting cigarettes (something for which quitting is worthwhile. Power hour? Nope, you can power hour the hell out of your time - with even more fun - if you keep smoking). ",2015-07-24 12:35:16+00:00,ctehqia,1.0,t3_3eekr7,32712.0,gaming

4) By converting the exponential for into logarithmic form, I obtain **log*_e_*(b) = y**

I came up with this sequence, too:

1) I want to demonstrate that **e^log*_e_*(b) = b**

2) I get the logarithm on base *e* of both sides **log*_e_*(e^log*_e_*(b) ) = log*_e_*(b)**

3) since **log*_a_*b^c = c** I simplify the left hand side and obtain **log*_e_*(b) = log*_e_*(b)**

4) Finally I convert it to exponential form, obtaining **e^log*_e_*(b) = b**
