I live in Venice, Italy, and one of my hobbies is Korean. I'm not a good Korean speaker at all, but I like keeping on learning it slowly at my own pace. 

I found that one of the best ways to learn languages was hosting gents with couchsurfing.com. I only had the chance to host one person from Korea though. It was summer 2015.

Now, I tried and search Korean travellers heading to Venice, but there's almost none! I guess either Koreans are not interested in Venice anymore or they switched to another platform. 

Is there a site similar to couchsurfing.com where I can host travellers from Korea?

He talked about an important tradition in his country, that I nicked *relay pilgrimage*. Essentially, a community from one village sets off to carrying their sacred orthodox icon to another village, which can be hundreds of miles away, led by a cult minister.

Upon arrival the icon is given to the local church and the community sets down there, while a/the community that has been living there sets off to another village with their icon, so on and so forth. This handover is thus a permutation of communities of the same cult.

Can you help me find more about this tradition? I'm not an anthropologist myself, yet I'd love to gather more information for a friend who has been settling a little community in the Dolomites in Friuli (Italy) and has found a lot of positive motivation by this ritual.

I can't seem to devise a proper recursive-only solution for the following problem.

Given an array of distinct positive integers, each of which stands for different coin values and a positive integer sum, I have to count all the possible combination which the given sum can be count with the coins in the array.

The function sign ought to be like this:

    int count_combinations(int v[], int n, int sum);

For example: 

    count_combinations({5, 2, 1}, 3, 6) 

ought to return 5

as 6 is:

I'm trying to devise an efficient way to manipulating strings without the language's built-in functions (not even ""string"".Length nor ""string"".Substring() nor ""string""[] and so on).

Let's say I want to substitute a letter of a string at the 3rd position.
    
    ""string"" -&gt; ""strong""

How can achieve it, without the aforementioned functions? My solution is generating lists of chars and by concatenating each of them, comparing them to the initial string. This way, starting from ""A"", ""B"", ..., ""aa"", ""ab"" I will eventually arrive at ""string"", which will return true to ""string"" = ""string"". At this point I will have a list of chars that correspond to the desired string, but... it is really expensive, computationally speaking.

Are there any other approaches? Can you think of or suggest me other solutions?
