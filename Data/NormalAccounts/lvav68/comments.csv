I.e I went for 13 months for surgical tech.
I was semi lucky and started pay @ 17.??.
6 years later it's about 23. I work 12 hour shifts 3 days out of the week, giving me free time to 1 find another job or just chill/take care of stuff. (There are also 8 and 10 hour shifts.) So you can have a 5 or 4 day work week.
Overtime , call/ critical pay is good. 
Benefits are also well, you can work at a hospital or medical center ( work week will definitely be no weekends).
Medical centers can pay more, or after experience you can be a travel tech.

5,"The first death of a loved one was my grandmother when I was in my 30's (2006?).
Which I find myself at odds because I didn't do what i think should have been a good mourning ( I didn't cry, maybe because I helped her a in the years before with driving her to groceries when my sister said no, and my Grandma would ask in advance). 
Well I was the one that found her passed away in her bed, when my mom and sister where home. Small things changed but nothing life altering. 
Oddly she died a few months after I graduated from surgical tech school, been at that for a few years now and I really enjoy it.
I've had a few dream with her in them.
But to say I miss her and cry, not done that.
So I attribute it to spending time with her, or not being there at the exact hour. 
Cause I think that's why some people cry for loved ones, some feel that they could have done more for them but always put it off and finally, there is no more chance to put if off.

Causing a hole in my head. Parkland hospital doc said it was a brain contusion with a skull depression. (But really a hole).
I was discharged after 3 days there. 
So far no after effects and I still have the original bur hole. This was back in 1998.

26,"Yeah, everything is great in my life, I sometimes feel the need to cry. 
There are many mistakes or should haves that I go get remorseful over but i don't and think positive in that they are still obtainable goals ( getting an associates then bachelors) 
I can't seem to date, I attribute that to maybe being unfiltered that most people can't deal with it, it just have a hard time making friends.  At 40 I gotta wonder.
Sometimes I can't make friends because i don't watch football so I can't relate or comment with male coworkers about the game. 
I tend to like obscure pieces if knowledge such as Cerberus, and the Gordian knot. 
Small philosophical things, 
Like I read that at death the brain has a few seconds of life and your life ""flashes before your eyes""...so what if right now you ARE experiencing that ""flash"" and don't know it. It could be a never ending loop.
Or how math is the closest we get to the language of God. Or self analysis, such as why I would get jealous and discovered for me it's down to an insecurity of lack of self confidence and part loosing that girl.
And sometimes I get tired of people and their small talk , like I care about my coworker's life outside of work. Or even work gossip about other co workers. Sometimes it's good to know to prevent future headaches.
Like this one coworker is always avoiding work and hides all the time, a total lazy phuck, yet breeds putt bulls to sell for 2grand. A pup. ( His bitch has had so many that they have to be c-sectioned out)
I have no respect for this guy.  So my dislike for him may be a partial reflection of how I am. And I strive not to be that way.  
I do my best to live by a few philosophies , the only time you can look down on someone is when you are helping them up.
And if good men do nothing, THAT is Evel enough.

31,"I'm gonna tell my story, which if things went wrong, I wouldn't be here to tell it.
It was Sept 16, 1998, i was looking for work when my cousin came into town, he was a trouble maker of sorts , liked to get into fight , short fuse, had a bad childhood ( we grew up side by side sometimes). He was working an odd Job in a hard wood flooring company and wanted me to come along to get some money in my pocket. We crashed at his ex brother in law's the night before. I couldn't sleep a wink, I wanted to stay and sleep and he insisted I go. 
I end up meeting the owner of the small business and rode in a gutted work van, it was a rainy day and we're headed to a far off work site.
We took I-20 in Dallas headed toward fort Worth.
The boss drove, another guy rode front passenger, my cousin and I in the back with left over stuff from the day before. 
Someone lost control and hit us, we bounced off a couple of cars and felt like we stopped , then an 18 wheeler hit us. ( Cops told my mom that they were headed to a car accident call before mine, but when they heard a rig was involved by their experience, the go to pick up bodies, they were surprised that I was the only one injured.)
My head hit the bolt that holds the spare tire to the wall, the spare was there. 
Parkland doctors called it a skull depression a brain contusion. (They went in to relieve pressure and clean up the dirt.)
But during that fray, I was semi calm and I with my whole being asked God, to keep us all safe , but if someone had to die, let it be me.
I'm not sure if that's what spared me, but I came away with virtually no injury, no brain damage, and my hospital stay was 3 days!!
What I find odd is that the staff wouldn't stare at my head with a piece of skull removed to ease the swelling but at the I.v lines coming out of my carotid. 
It's almost gonna be 20 years ago, and life is and has been normal. 
I've since then lost contact with my cousin. I really hope he's doing well. 
People hate Parkland cause it takes forever, but I can't complain, I worked there once and saw a girl in surgery who had similar injury ( her friends convinced her to car surf) , the delay in treatment caused swelling which in turn caused permanent brain damage, she was 16/17. 
I can't imagine as a parent, what they are going through, and I'm thinking that could've been me....
So be good to everyone you come across you don't know how tough or easy their battle in life is. 
Plus as people say karma is a bitch only of you are. most people ask what are they meant to do here, I'm also still asking what mine is....
But I try and pray everyday.

Secondly, you shouldn't worry about what they say, the minute you can pay bills with that, then care. 
Tertiary, there are women who WANT to take that (may be a control issue though).
So the time will come when it does.

You partially know what NOT to do. 
Encourage your daughter,  find things that make her independent, strong and strong willed but not overtly strong willed. Things that will giver her confidence. 
I'm sort of in a similar boat, my parents some of college but never really pushed hard for it. And the other part is me being a lazy butt. The potential and smarts were there I just never found how to unlock nor instigated it. And part of that is goal setting. 
They valued good ethics, and hard work, but not how to be smart about it. Relax about trying to get it perfect, there is no perfect parent nor perfect parenting. 
There are good and great guidelines,such as do your best to eliminate ""no"" and any vocabulary that will imprint a ""hold back/can't mentality.
Let them fail and then ask them what they could have done different to bring a better result. I think part of the reason some people don't try is fear of failure, if only people knew that failure IS part of success.

She had an hour glass figure and was a house/industry model. ( Not runway stuff, but fabric display to major buyers). 
She loved to dance.  
So I if I find out a woman can't cook, she is undatable for me. 
I lost my virginity at 21 and she was a thicker girl, so I look at curvy hour glass figured women as the ones I want to date and have sex with. I'm not big on super skinny women.

And that coupled with other things I will hold against her if she ever wants to try and date again ( she did leave that door open, but I can't and won't go back).

133,"My story may have been a cathartic. 
I get where you are coming from emotionally.  I rarely date,  and for long relationships at 39  I've only had 3 including my divorce. 
My last one was a co-worker ( second time breaking the rule, because I felt something different from her).  We dated for near three months. Broke up after Easter. Long story short she brought her A game, and made me grow in many ways, she showed me that I CAN be in a relationship. ( I was resolved long  ago to being single for a long time). 
She helped my patience and understanding grow a lot. I felt many things I never felt with others ( including my marriage!). I will never tell her but she is the standard that all other women will be tested by from now on! She had a profound affect on me and my outlook. 
I was getting close to  falling hard for her, then she changed attitude and made  a lot of passive aggressive actions that made it hard to be her boyfriend. 
She said work and school stress plus adding me to the mix was to much. Everything that made us a good match now we're her excuses as to why it  wouldn't work. I was too techy, and "" annoyingly positive "" ( she has a life long battle with depression.) 
So I cried  a bit when we broke up, I didn't want to I wanted to keep the relationship. 
She didn't. 
There's a lot more to my story, but it's been a month and I still miss her. 
She helped me see beyond the physical ( she wasn't a perfect ten and in my eyes she didn't have to be!!
I saw a lot of potential with this relationship. 
And now I have to see her at work ( we did work the same schedule, not any more since this week. ) I needed to switch for my emotional health. 
There is no animosity from either side. But I can't be friends with her, she violated a piece of trust that can never be again. ( it was the way she forced me to break up with her passively). She didn't have the courage confront it. 

I don't get her, after the break up she was more friendly at work and tried to start a conversation ( forced in a way because there was literally nothing in the break room to have any sort of conversation about. But she  paused and was looking for something to talk about. A loaf of bread she made , she is a phenomenal cook. I try to steer clear of her, and have minimal professional contact with her.
 But I'm not gonna lie, I miss the fucking shit out her, her voice, her eyes her not so hot but wonderful figure.  She meant a lot to me, and now I have to move on.  I was at a plateau and she brought me to whole other level. Then left me hanging, wanting more. 
But I learned a lot of what I want and what I will and will not accept.
I'm sure she wants to keep open an opportunity, but I can't ever let her back in. 
I can't allow to be hurt and be minimalized as she made me feel at the end. 
If she can learn to  handle stress and be cured of her depression, she would be an a class woman. ",2016-04-30 03:38:52+00:00,d2mz3q4,3,t1_d2mwyj1,3740,sex
134,"Everyone copes differently. For me I grew up with my Grandma in my mom's side my entire life. I did stuff for her , took her on grocery runs when she asked my sister and she rudely said no because she stayed up late ( not even because of going out). I was helpful to her when I could , because God knows my parents could only do so much. 
Well any way, I had at the time this unspoken thing with a woman, ( I was a recent grad, and waiting for my certification and interviews, so looking for work and on unemployment) . I'd go spend my weekends with her when I didn't have my son the other weekends.
 So I'd make it a point of when I came back, to greet my grand ma as I returned. Usually on Sundays. Well on a whim I stayed an extra day with Esther and returned on a Monday. I walk in to find my mom sleeping in the sun room, and my sister sleeping in her room, so I proceed to walk straight to my grandma's room, I  being out, with my mom and sister at home. I'm the one who finds her in her bed peacefully passed away. So for a fraction of a second I didn't want to believe, but I can see how she looked. I hugged her for a bit and then fly downstairs to tellmy mom then my sis.
I oddly kept my composure and they are the ones that break down really bad!! 
And I'm feeling guilty as shit for feeling that I traded a night of sex for not being there for my Grandma, and at the same time a resentment towards my mom and sis for ""sleeping on the job"". My grandma was not ill by any means, just old age and peritonitis ( according to family doc) got her. 
And for a long time I didn't feel up to it. And if the occasion did rise there was a tinge of guilt. And I feel odd that she passed away 6 months after I graduated surgical tech school. 
So every once I a while I get a feeling in my stomach that I'm gonna find my mom the same way, she grew up destitute and malnourished in Mexico, and it has had a life long affect on her health.
She took over my grandma's bedroom after her passing, so that feeling creeps up everyone in a while when I walk up the stairs and open that door. 
I feel that I never fully grieved for my Grandma, not sure how to either... But over the years looking back I've noticed that I'm the one that finds pets/ animals and then my grandma. I knew it but it didn't really sink until I found a peacock practically at my feet, in front of this floor to ceiling window where the computer was at, at that time. Of all places to die, it died close to me. 
Over the years it's been mostly dogs. 
I still haven't figured out why I'm the ""designated deceased body encounterer"".

She passed away in 2011, and I try not to think about it, because she unintentionally raised me, because my grandmother wasn't able to raise her kids, she had to work in America to support them and they lived in Mexico.  ( she missed out on parenting and my sister and I became surrogate kids to her)
My parents where there but , she wanted to do my laundry, cook meals for me, spoil me with what ever meals I wanted ( but I was never a brat about it). She took over the house duties my mother as a home maker would normally do. 
 But going back to grieving, making out with you may have been to help him cope, not as in a bad distraction but a respite from the pain.  You guys share an intimacy on many levels. And it seems like you have a lot more than just a fwb. So tread carefully, don't pressure him for anything right now. Just be there when he needs you. 
One may not have a lot of friends to lean on during such times. 
I know I didn't. But I've put myself in that position. I don't  attempt to make friends easy, I have an inherent distrust of everyone. 
I was a painfully shy kid , and became outgoing near the end of junior high. 
I'll turn 40 this year and I don't really have someone I can call on for help.
So just support him the best you can. And sometimes the distractions are good. You can be the light that guides him in this time of darkness. ",2016-04-30 02:20:17+00:00,d2mwd1t,1,t3_4h2lun,2338,sex

149,"I have never used not had t mobile, I WAS a sprint subscriber for a good 13 years. And touted them as good, then I tried Verizon, and loved their service. 
Now here's my opinion, the reason t mobile has great customer service is due to lack of great network. ( I mean think about it, people have to call in a lot to get such a good rating, which means , a lot of people are CALLING IN!).
I rarely had bad billing issues with sprint, and from what I experienced also rarely had bad service. I would call them every once in a while to check up on deals, or when they had retention dept get deep device discounts. Switch plans ( I once had the 500 min free incoming calls from their nextel acquisition).
Then last year switched to Verizon, and I have seen the drastic difference from sprint to VZ on call and data quality. And NEVER had to call them for service issues, only to keep my 10 extra gigs from a holiday promo they had( glad they let me, it's been a life saver!) But I have seen people have bad calls throttled data and poor service from T-Mobile.
And here for me is the weird part I worked for sprint, att and contract for Verizon. 
As a former wireless sales rep from pre 9/11.
Sprint had ghetto customers, att port overs complained about their former carriers bad service or billing, and VZ customers paid bill on time. 
I had a lot of sprint customers pay late , and had to wait for service to be cut back on. You see sprint had an awesome idea to give everyone a 0 deposit line activation. So they got a boat load of shitty credit customers who couldn't pay their bills on time at least. 
While Verizon had or has a more stringent credit policy. ( but the cools thing is if you had a deposit, if you paid on time, it would be returned with interest!). 
Att has or had a similar policy.
That's where sprint fucked up. They got a bunch of customers who couldn't pay on time and waited till service was cut off and then bitch about it because they didn't want to pay their total past due with late fees. And it's easier to pay 100 than 400 or 500. ( 3bills plus late fees).
Hence years ago they restructured they payment system to get people to pay on time. They just service at one month or two, to get people to pay only 1month past due vs 3 or 4.
Plus all carriers try to one up each other on better wireless service, which is mostly true from VZ, remember when att had commercials saying least dropped calls from any network, and after a while they stopped? 
Turns out that Verizon presented them with hard data that that wasn't the case. What company would quit such boastings if they were a true honest  selling point?",2016-04-13 05:22:03+00:00,d20tr1a,1,t3_4ejdyf,12897,technology

177,"Lay off the porn!! It almost had me where you are at.  You need to find a way to find real home grown local women attractive. Porn mostly gives you a distorted sense if hyper pretty women. 
My change pattern started with during porn I thought about that last woman I was with or the last good one. And way less masturbation, it desensitised me and that's what made it hard to physically feel how good it was. And add some ""taboo"" idea like wanting to ""get her pregnant"". The allure of the"" danger "", is what I find erotic. 
From there it will get better, but you HAVE TO lay off the porn.  Let your testicles accumulate semen, that will help also. Once you leave the porn, direct it toward real in your face women. 
My last girlfriend wasn't a 10, a little thick, but I enjoyed her because she was vocal and  had a very slight similar look to Jena Malone ( sucker punch movie).  As if she was her thicker sister. 
So for me the turn on was her faces and vocality during sex.

Line 1 if awake go to 2 
Line 2 restroom /activity if restroom go to 3

Create a routine and you can add subroutines.

My best advice is to use it the daydream and make daydreams about the goals you want to complete, in full detail, like if they are about women finding you sexy. Turn that to hey women find men who study sexy, they find goal accomplished men sexy. Or men who do outside of work hobbies sexy.

183,"Well there are verbal ques(SP?), the prime example was the one you mentioned in the post, she wasn't looking for serious. She wanted a one nighter or a fwb. 
If she says. ""Seeing what's out there"". Is a 'testing the waters"", statement to you. women don't want to appear easy , but want sex as much as the next guy. 
In your end , you can use the exact same statement, or say "" I'm not sure"", a blatant one can be ""looking for fun"" or. ""I wanna date, but not looking for something serious right away"".  
But, honesty sometimes you can ""pick up"" when they wanna just bang. But if you do, DO NOT make it obvious. Play the mellow go with the flow kind if guy, but always treat them nice, make them feel comfortable. In short ""you gotta wrap your tongue around her mind"" a guy told me that last century way when I was a virgin ( lost it at 21!)
I was on okcupid a while back and met a girl who said she worked I.T. for a college in Dallas and went on a few dates didn't feel promising but on the third/fourth date she mentioned that she was a blogger and reviewed sex toys, and I banged her in the car that night. It was her que that says let's have sex.  She talked a little about her toys and bad sex partners. And actually brought them on one occasion.
So the dates before her big reveal, I was a nice well behaved gentleman, she was nice and well behaved.
As many women won't admit to liming sex as much sometimes keeping it on the down low and as a ""I thought about it , but it's not expected. It if doesn't happen , it doesn't!"" 
Most women WANT and NEED to know that you will not disrespect her not treat/perceive her differently after the sex.
Now that's not to say sex then cuddle, cause cuddling is relationship territory. But once you guys finish , have a conversation with her.  Or during ask her what she likes and what position, be vocal about it feeling good, not vulgar but that you like it. Make very sure she comes at least once. Your finger can find that g spot and she will thank you for it. You don't have to lick clit, but understand if you don't lick ( for trust /taste reasons, she won't go down). Once done, ask her if it was good, and a simple (if your place) ""do you wanna stick around?"" And hers ""want me to stick around? Or offer to eat/get food.  At some point there she will let tell you if it's a one nighter fwb or is looking for more. 
Then you can ask to call her or if she wants to do it again sometime. Now for your profile make it seem (if you are not) a fun out going guy. Put it in words a couple of pics of you and friends. You pic have to convey what you want also. Certain pics will let her "" see"" what you are looking for. 
I hope this helps. 
And importantly engage her in good conversation with a bit of flirtiness.

It's a generational thing as was hip hop clothes/ grunge wear in the 90's.
I wouldn't be to surprised if the flapper look came back in style in these 30's.
Personally for me I love the 3 piece tailored suit look, I  wouldn't mind that coming back. But I'm a surgical tech and o.r. scrubs are where it's at for work wear. (pajamas all day!!!!) It's not fashion but a fashion trend and every one knows trends come and go.

For American I feel Inception ( different types of action and it's also a cerebral movie, that's how I like them). John wick is good revenge flick. I am ok with the expendables type ( again not very cerebral).  But 300 is great!!  
Predator is awesome!! But for strong females lead aliens!!!!  Dune with Sting, exceptional for its time!!!!
Now foreign action,   man from nowhere (Korean,  think a better ""man on fire""! And I like that one.) 
District 13,(French)  not be confused with district 9 ( filmed in Africa). 
Gen y and gen x cops maybe. I like strong female leads, so that is another  category ( Sucker Punch!)

It was a nice light blue and blue console with matching controller.  So you may luck out on a great deal. They have ps3 and some ps4, gonna pick up a 3 later on. (i have been of the Sony camp for years, but like the 360 so far).  I hope that helps. 
Oh also the attendant added a 6 month warranty at no extra cost!! All in all for not heavy research nor help, I feel that I got it at a great price! Me, my son and niece are thoroughly enjoying it.

As. A guy who has been single most of my life and for some reason I feel inadequate for not finishing college ( plan on going back, just never start). Make your mental  approach toward women in the "" I'm gonna make a friend "" vs "" I want to get her number to date her"" makes it easier and less pressure fore you and her ( many women get hit on quite a lot, so they are om the defense as soon as they step outside thier door).
When I took that approach,  i was able to hold conversation easier cause I wasn't in the "" next line to feed her"" mode.
You like comics? Go to a comic book store! ( i met a total cutie but I think she was too young.) 
Like anime?  Hit up an anime convention!
Read books? A reading group. 
Or get on your pc and check out the myriad of groups on meetup.com, i joined but went to few, but since everyone there is for the same thing, it's already a ""no pressure "" environment.  go to a meet and ask her what got her into (......)? and how long she as been in the group?
