Any how, I've realized that growing from spawn is easy, actually making the spawn is when it will get a little trickier. You'll start dealing with more contamination and things will get frustrating, but you'll figure out how to deal with that in time too. I've never done the cloning with cardboard thing, I've mostly used agar so maybe that way is easier. I don't know I'm just a novice.

1687,"Great! Thank you so much. I've read your stuff I here before and like your approach. Thank you for offering to help. I've personally grown more and more interested in mycology recently and wanted to make the step from foraging to cultivation. It's something fun my son and I kind of do together so when he got a pretty open-ended sixth grade agriculture project we figured we'd give this a shot. 


Our plan was to take the grain spawn (looks like a gallon or so by volume not for sure, I'll check tomorrow), and grow it on wood and straw and document which grows better. This evening we packed several buckets with straw that are soaking right now. We had planned to fill the mylar bags we bought with sub and put them in my old pressure cooker then distribute the spawn within and put it in a Tupperware bin under the house until it started pinning or whatever then put the bags in my yard under the tree where mushrooms always grow. 

This is my tentative plan. I want to learn this so badly. I've read so much but this is my first attempt. Thank you for all of your help.",2015-09-03 00:20:51+00:00,cuoragl,3.0,t1_cuoowhv,4470.0,MushroomGrowers
