0,"I think the way to do this is to try to figure out who the Avengers will be in Phase 4.

First of all, Captain America and Iron Man. These guys have been the focus of eight movies already. Even if the actors weren't expensive, we are going to want to shift the focus to younger actors who can lead their own franchises in the future.

Captain America is going to have a role in the newly reformed SHIELD. Perhaps Jeffrey Mace steps down as Director of SHIELD and Captain America becomes Director of SHIELD. He would take over the role in the movies previously filled by Nick Fury. They might even be able to finally get a Captain America cameo on Agents of SHIELD.

Tony Stark in the comics became Secretary of Defense. 2016 was an election year and if President Ellis did not get re-elected then Thunderbolt Ross is probably not Secretary of State so Tony Stark could take over that role. It does seem silly though making the one person who needs the most oversight the actual overseer.

Black Widow is supposed to be getting her own movie in Phase 4. Most likely it will involve aliens or time travel or aliens and time travel and it will set up the next major Avengers movie. If Ghost in the Shell becomes a franchise then she could be busy. Expect a Black Widow movie, if it happens, to be a one off, not because she isn't popular but because there aren't a lot of good Black Widow stories from the comics.

Captain Marvel's movie, if successful, will become a trilogy. It is very unlikely that they will introduce her and immediately kill her off so expect her to be around for a while.

Ant Man and the Wasp will also be in the New Avengers. Marvel likes making trilogies so imagine Ant Man 3 will have Taskmaster as the villain (if he is not already slated to appear in Ant Man and the Wasp). Another possible villain would be Egghead. Better yet, they could have Egghead be the villain for the flashbacks with Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne and then have Egghead appear at the end as an old man and have him be behind whatever problem they face in present day.

War Machine will stay in the Avengers. In case you missed it, Rhodey was walking at the end of Civil War and even if he is limping for the rest of his life, he doesn't need his legs to operated the War Machine suit.

Falcon, likewise, will remain in the New Avengers. I don't expect Winter Soldier to return. He is a bit of a one note character, what with his metal arm and all. Yes, it might be good to see him redeemed but he also deserves a chance at a normal life.

Tom Holland is signed on for two more Spider-Man movies after Homecoming but the actor is still young so I suspect he could do as many as nine Spider-Man movies when all is said and done, not including Spider-Man centric Avengers movies. Most likely though the MCU will get rebooted after he's done just six solo movies so they can do more movies with Spider-Man in high school (and with what will by then be a cheaper actor).

Nova and/or Quasar will probably be introduced during Infinity War. If they are both introduced then they will complete the roster of the New Avengers for now, although obviously they could add characters like Ms. Marvel later.

Dr. Cho and Prof. Selvig will remain as supporting characters. Jane Foster and her friends won't be seen again.

Thor will probably stay in Asgard and it makes sense for the Hulk to also stay in Asgard. The Hulk is probably still wanted for what happened in Johannesburg. Most likely if Hulk and Thor appear again it will be because Doctor Strange went to Asgard to get them.

Doctor Strange 2 is supposedly going to feature Nightmare. Doctor Strange 3 may very well have Dormammu return and Doctor Strange will call on the help of the Avengers including Hulk and Thor. It would be good if they could also have Namor appear. If you've read any Marvel comics from the seventies then you know why.

Valkyrie is going to appear in Thor Ragnarok along with Thor, Hulk and Doctor Strange. She is also a major character from the seventies.

The New Avengers are a bit crowded so I can see Hawkeye hanging out with Doctor Strange. First of all, I can see Hawkeye, as a SHIELD agent, being asked to look into this magic stuff that Doctor Strange is doing. Expect a lot of reaction shots from Jeremy Renner when Doctor Strange does cool stuff.

Similarly, the Black Panther is the king of Wakanda. He isn't going to hang out in New York with the New Avengers. If anything, Doctor Strange will go grab him when he is needed.

She-Hulk is a character that can join Doctor Strange's Mighty Avengers. Basically, the Leader will use Bruce Banner's blood to make Hulks but Jennifer Walters will fight on the side of good.

Scarlet Witch may seek out Strange's help to control her powers. It isn't clear if her magic is really different from Doctor Strange's magic. Presumably he and Wong can teach her to do new things.

Tina Minoru, if she didn't die off screen in Doctor Strange, could potentially be one of the Mighty Avengers. She would take the place of Clea and could potentially be a love interest for Doctor Strange. She could also be the guardian of the Hong Kong Sanctum and thus Strange's equal. We also don't know who the new guardian of the London Sanctum will be. It could be Doctor Druid or it could be Brother Voodoo. My vote is for Doctor Druid and have Brother Voodoo show up in some other capacity.

Sif, Heimdall, the Warriors Three and the Guardians of the Galaxy would show up as supporting characters in future films.

Future MCU storylines could involve a Fisk presidency, an Osborn presidency, the Skrulls, Korvac, Avengers from the future coming back in time or a Kree / Xandar war.

There's also the question of who gets what Infinity Stone after Avengers: Infinity War. I imagine Strange keeps the time stone, Asgard gets back the stone from the tesseract, Captain Marvel keeps a stone, the Guardians keep a stone and the other two stone would most likely be guarded by Tina Minoru (if she's still alive) and Doctor Druid. They could also rebuild the Vision and have him guard the Mind Stone. I think killing the Vision in Infinity Wars and then using the Infinity Stones to rebuild the Vision creates the feeling that there are no consequences. You would also have to ask why the Scarlet Witch would bring back the Vision and not Quicksilver.

It would be cool if Gaurdians 3 ended with the Guardians using an Infinity Stone to freeze the Kree and Xandar armies and then send them back to their respective planets so that they can give negotiations a chance. Of course, that begs the question as to why they were fighting in the first place. Why were they fighting in the past? What were the issues?

Eventually, the current actors will become too old. There's no need to panic however. Feige seems bound and determined to tell all the old Avengers stories from the past. The TV shows are rapidly becoming their own thing. The most likely TV / movie crossover would be to have Wilson Fisk and Norman Osborn working together. Or maybe they will be trying to take each other out. Just don't expect a movie with hundreds of characters because it just wouldn't be worth the effort.",2016-11-21 15:17:23+00:00,da9kdoe,1.0,t3_5e1d9i,50160.0,marvelstudios

8,"Giordano Bruno (Italian: [dʒorˈdano ˈbruno]; Latin: Iordanus Brunus Nolanus; 1548 – 17 February 1600), born Filippo Bruno, was an Italian Dominican friar, philosopher, mathematician, poet, and astrologer.[3] He is remembered for his cosmological theories, which conceptually extended the then novel Copernican model. He proposed that the stars were just distant suns surrounded by their own exoplanets and raised the possibility that these planets could even foster life of their own (a philosophical position known as cosmic pluralism). He also insisted that the universe is in fact infinite and could have no celestial body at its ""center"".

Beginning in 1593, Bruno was tried for heresy by the Roman Inquisition on charges including denial of several core Catholic doctrines, including eternal damnation, the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, the virginity of Mary, and transubstantiation. Bruno's pantheism was also a matter of grave concern.[4] The Inquisition found him guilty, and he was burned at the stake in Rome's Campo de' Fiori in 1600. After his death, he gained considerable fame, being particularly celebrated by 19th- and early 20th-century commentators who regarded him as a martyr for science,[5] although historians have debated the extent to which his heresy trial was a response to his astronomical views or to other aspects of his philosophy and theology.[6][7][8][9][10] Bruno's case is still considered a landmark in the history of free thought and the emerging sciences.[11][12][13]",2016-11-19 23:19:59+00:00,da7iknq,1.0,t3_5dtbti,22802.0,AskReddit

14,"We literally have no idea what Avengers 4 is about.  There has been some speculation about the Avengers forming a new team and that the title would be New Avengers or Avengers Initiative.  Others have pointed out that the movie could deal with the fallout from Infinity War and deal with the question of what to do with the Infinity Stones and the title could be Avengers: Infinity Watch or Avengers: Illuminati.  Or it could be a combination of the two with the title still undetermined.  In any case, I would not expect Daredevil to appear in Infinity War.  Why?  Because when Thanos attacks Earth they are not going to be looking for the help of an ordinary human with enhanced fighting skills.  Thus Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Elektra, the Punisher and Colleen Wing will all sit Infinity War out.  

On the other hand, there's the question of whether or not the Defenders Netflix series features an event that would place the Defenders under the jurisdiction of the Sokovia accords.  Even then, an Agents of SHIELD / Defenders crossover seems more likely than an Avengers / Defenders crossover.  The real problem is that ABC TV isn't going to pay to have Daredevil and the Black Widow both appear on Agents of SHIELD.  I think Scarlett Johansson's view is that if they have her appear on Netflix or ABC then she's missing out on the big paycheck that comes with a movie appearance.  Maybe if they gave Black Widow her own movie then she would agree to appear on either Netflix or ABC TV.  That would be easier than trying to shoehorn Daredevil into a two hour movie.

30,"Episode 9

The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) return to Washington and are surprised to see Marc Spector. Thunderbolt Ross tells them that Spector has overheard intel concerning a plot to bring a nuclear weapon from Kazakhstan to the U.S. He says that the information is limited so the Thunderbolts are going to be on call until the CIA is able to investigate the veracity of this information. He tells them that they are to enjoy a little bit of R&amp;R but to not go too far away and stay in touch.

So, yeah, it’s anti-hero’s night out. Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Marc Spector, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter all go out together for a night on the town. And it isn’t the slightest bit suspicious because they are three men and three women. Shippers will be wetting their pants and, yes, Elektra and the Punisher do get a hotel room and end up in bed together as do Spider-Woman and Marc Spector and Bobbi and Hunter. Bobbi and Hunter are married so it’s no big deal. Jessica and Marc discuss how they are both compelled to do things and how it is making each of them a little bit crazy.

Episode 10

Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Marc Spector, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter are called in by Thunderbolt Ross. Apparently he has new intel.

The big bad is Igor Stravinsky. His group is known as Leviathan. 
They had ties to the KGB and the Black Widow program and perhaps even the Soviet Winter Soldier program. He tells them that they will need to expect to face enhanced individuals. Their weapons may be useless. They need to train as they have never trained before.

Bobbi organizes time in a gym. The Thunderbolts are trained in hand to hand combat. As most of them are ex-military. this is nothing new to them but Bobbi tells them that the object of this exercise is to have everybody learn from each other.

Thunderbolt Ross calls them in again. The CIA has credible intel as to the bomb’s location are to be shipped out ASAP.

Episode 11

Igor Stravinsky was, of course, a member of Hydra and was involved in the Winter Soldier program. Sebastian Stan appears as the Winter Soldier. We see the Winter Soldier sent out on a mission by Stravinsky. Scarlett Johansson may cameo as the Black Widow.

Years later, after the fall of Hydra, Igor joined Leviathan. They wanted Igor to provide them with super soldiers of their own. They have many recruits. Not all of them survive but he manages to produce a six member team of super soldiers who are all capable of surviving conventional attacks.

Episode 12

The Thunderbolts arrive in Kazakhstan and meet with the local CIA team. They explain to them exactly where the bomb is being hidden and how it is being protected. The CIA operatives explain that they will assist them in penetrating the facility.

The Thunderbolts get past the Leviathan guards. Now they must face the Leviathan super soldiers.

Episode 13

As Ross predicted, guns, knives and batons are not effective against the super soldiers. Venom blasts turn out to be very effective, however, but even at close range they do not kill, only weaken, and Spider-Woman needs time to recharge. Thus the battle rages on for most of the episode.

Ultimately, the Tunderbolts are successful and the CIA takes possession of the nuclear bomb. Obviously the bomb will have to be turned over to the Soviets but the actual terms under which the bomb is returned will have to be negotiated. After all, the Soviets don’t want to have it come out that they allowed a nuclear weapon to fall into the hands of domestic terrorists.

The Thunderbolts return back to Washington. Drug lords in Colombia are dead, hostages were rescued in South East Asia and Africa, terror threats in Egypt and Kazakhstan were eliminated. And yet their names stayed out of the newspapers. Officially, they are all in prison. That means they have done their jobs.

31,"The Punisher series ends with the Punisher going to jail. 
Meanwhile, Elektra is brought back to life in the Defenders and Bullseye is introduced and imprisoned at the end of Daredevil Season 3. Each series ends with Thunderbolt Ross propositioning them to join the Thunderbolts.

Episode 1

The episode begins mid res. Elektra, the Punisher, Bullseye and Marc Spector are fighting drug lords in South America.

One week ago, Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye and Marc Spector were recruited by Thunderbolt Ross. They were to be his special ops team. Under no circumstances were they to ever tell anyone who they were working for: their actions overseas will violate international laws and perhaps even be considered acts of war by the US government against the local countries. In particular, their actions could be seen as violating the Sokovia Accords because their abilities are arguably superhuman, But fuck the accords because they were just a way to rein in the Avengers and SHIELD. The United States always has and always will carry out covert missions overseas.

Their first mission: to take out a group of drug lords in Colombia.
The drug lords are easily taken down. It’s like a video game in which guys with guns pop up and are immediately put down.

The episode ends with Thunderbolt Ross talking to an ex-Hydra scientist. The scientist explains to him how Hydra was able to control its operatives. He brings Thunderbolt Ross into a room in which a woman is tied up and sedated. Her name is Jessica Drew. Hydra scientists were able to give her special abilities and use mind control to get her to work for Hydra. Thunderbolt Ross asks if he can fix her. He explains that by “fixing her” he means reversing the mind control. He further explains that by “reversing the mind control” he means getting her to work for him.

Episode 2

Some time ago, SHIELD was able to get intel on Hydra and identify all their active bases. The US government sent troops to all these bases in a coordinated attack. It was not without casualties , however. Jessica Drew aka the Spider-Woman was able to take out several government agents single handedly.

Jessica was recruited by Hyrda and given an experimental formula based on spider venom. Most of the test subjects didn’t survive. Jessica, however, gained the abilities to climb walls and shoot blasts of “venom”which were actually static electric charges that built up in her body over time. She could release the blasts at will most effectively when she came in contact with a person, in which case the blasts could be lethal.

Her costume was bullet proof. Ironically it was tasers that brought her down. She and the other survivors of the assault were imprisoned. Eventually she was brought to Washington. Thunderbolt Ross wanted to get her to work for him.

She was showing signs of progress. She was able to remember her name and who she was. Her back story was similar to that of the Scarlet Witch in that she was from Eastern Europe and her parents were killed in an American airstrike, Ross tells the ex-Hydra scientist to make her forget about that part of her past. Have her instead remember how Hydra turned her into a weapon. Make her believe that it is her job to eliminate similar threats to justice and freedom.

Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye and Marc Spector return from Colombia. He introduces the newest member of their group, the Spider-Woman.

Episode 3

Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye, Marc Spector and Spider-Woman are sent to Madripore, an island in the South China Sea between the Philippines and Malaysia. When they arrive they are greeted by Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter who explain their mission. 

Apparently, Thunderbolt Ross recruited Morse and Hunter after they left SHIELD and sent them to Madripore to determine the degree to which local Muslim terrorists are a threat to Western interests. They requested back up and they got the Tunderbolts.

The Muslim terrorists apparently now have Western hostages, including Americans, Europeans and Japanese. They were apparently on a tour of the area. (God knows why: Boracay would be right next door.) Their orders are to go in and take out the terrorists and rescue the hostages.

Of course, things go wrong: Bullseye kills one of the hostages for fun. The Punisher then kills Bullseye by shooting him in the forehead.

Episode 4

Thunderbolt Ross is pissed. Not only did one of the hostages die but one of the team members is dead. He wants to know what happened.

The whole team vouches for the Punisher. Bullseye went off the deep end, they all say, and he killed one of the hostages. The Punisher saw him as a threat no different from the terrorists. He made a call and the other Thunderbolts all support his decision.

Thunderbolt dismissed them. He talks with the ex-Hydra scientist. The ex-Hydra scientist tells him that the group has shown signs of bonding over the incident. He says they have actually exceeded expectations: he wanted a group of mercenaries but he ended up with a team.

Thunderbolt Ross calls them back in. He tells them that their next mission will be in Egypt. Muslim terrorists again only this time operating from a location that could be a threat to Western interests in Europe.

Episode 5

Marc Spector wakes up in a tomb. A statue of the ancient Egyptian god Khonshu is there with him. He passes out again.

The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Marc Spector, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) were sent to Egypt. They attacked the local Muslim terrorist cell but there was an explosion and Marc Spector took the brunt of it. Locals dragged Marc Spector’s body away and placed it in the tomb. Perhaps they thought the Egyptian god Khonshu would bring the foreign soldier back to life.

Marc Spector wakes up again. He hears a voice in his head. We don’t hear it but he does. He believes it is the voice of Khonshu telling him that he is going to be working for him from now on, that he will be the knight of the moon, the Moon Knight.

Marc Spector wanders out of the cave. He has lost contact with the other Thunderbolts and has no choice but to go to the American embassy. Thunderbolt Ross arranges for him to return to Washington where the rest of the team is waiting for him.
When he arrives back in Washington, Marc Spector tells Ross that he wants out, that he doesn’t want to work for Ross anymore.

Episode 6

Marc Spector tells Ross that he has no ill will with Ross or the rest of the team but that he “just can’t do this anymore”. Ross says he understands, that Spector has been through considerable trauma recently and that if he feels it is time for him to retire them the US government will provide him with a healthy severance package. He is provided with a new name and identity: from now on he will be Stephen Grant, resident of Long Island New York. Marc Spector assumes his new identity and moves into his new home. He also gets a job as a New York taxi driver using his real name and a made up resume. People call him “Frenchie”.

Meanwhile, Thunderbolt Ross tells Bobbi that she is now in charge of the Thunderbots. She accepts the new position. He tells her that they are to ship out ASAP for Africa.

Episode 7

The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) travel to Lagos, Nigeria and meet with their local mission specialist, Jerico Drumm. In the comics, Jerico Drumm is known as Brother Voodoo but here is just an expert on ancient African religions. Apparently, local girls have been kidnapped by one of these cults. They are being used as sex slaves. The government isn’t equipped to deal with them. 
Thunderbolt is sending the Thunderbolts in exchange for valuable trade benefits for the United States.

Meanwhile, Marc Spector goes to work driving his taxi in the worst parts of New York. In his taxi, hi picks up drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes. He hears things. On some nights, he doesn’t go out as Frenchie. Instead, he goes out as Moon Knight. He doesn’t have a cape: he just has a white suit and a white mask. He also doesn’t want to drive one of Steven Grant’s cars so he drives his taxi and hopes that nobody ntioces Frenchie wearing a white suit. He then pulls the taxi over, gets out and puts on his Moon Knight mask. Some criminals are going to get their ass whooped.

Episode 8

Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter are being briefed by Jerico Drumm. Apparently they have learned where the cult is keeping the young girls. Bobbi Morse tells the team that this is to be a stealth mission. She doesn’t want a single hostage to lose her life this time.

Marc Spector is driving his taxi again. He picks up Russian men. Marc puts on a thick French accent. The two Russians get into the cab and start talking as though he wasn’t’even there. Marc hears something about a nuclear weapon in Kazakhstan. They say that they are investigating different options as to how to smuggle it out of Kazakhstan and use it against the United States.

The Thunderbolts rescue the young girls and the young girls are returned to their parents. Of course, a lot of cult members get killed: they get stabbed, shot, blasted and hit over the head with batons. But it all happens so quickly that none of the girls get hurt.

Meanwhile, in Washington, Spector shows up in Ross’s office. He says he wants back in.

33,"Yeah, if only Marvel could do what DC is doing and have characters from four different shows come together and form a team. :)

Seriously though, I think we are going to see some Netflix / ABC TV crossovers soon.  The problem is scheduling: Netflix series drop all at once so it would be hard to have a story that crosses from Agents of SHIELD into, say, Defenders and then back into Agents of SHIELD.  

Did you hear the rumor that Marvel TV asked Nicholas Cage to reprise his role as Johnny Blaze and Nicholas Cage said ""No""?  That makes me wonder if they can't do a Johnny Blaze / Blade crossover series on Netflix as a spin off of Agents of SHIELD and bring back both Nicholas Cage and Wesley Snipes.  Wesley Snipes has talked about reprising his role as Blade but having him be a mentor.  I would be up for one last hurrah with Johnny Blaze and Blade in which they pass the torch to younger characters like Robbie Reyes.",2016-11-17 02:11:44+00:00,da3nh08,2.0,t1_da3c0rp,15663.0,marvelstudios

""Marvel director Scott Derrickson told IGN what he'd most like to explore in a Doctor Strange sequel.

""When asked what elements from source comics he’d most want to feature in another movie, Derrickson said:

""“I really like the character of Nightmare and the concept that the Nightmare Realm is a dimension. [...] That’s early – that’s like the first Strange tale. I think that’s in the introductory episode of Doctor Strange, and I always loved that.""

""Nightmare did, indeed, first appear alongside the debut of Doctor Strange in Strange Tales #110 (July, 1963). He is the despotic ruler of the Dream Dimension, where humans visit while sleeping, has green hair and a black, horned horse named Dreamstalker. Who wouldn’t want to see that in a movie?

""Derrickson also went on to say why the character wasn't used as a villain in Strange's first cinematic outing:

""“We decided not to do that because that’s a bit of a complex idea to try to introduce everything we do introduce and introduce the idea of nightmares themselves as being a dimension. I hope somewhere down the line we do get to explore that because I think that’s super cool concept.”""",2016-11-16 04:12:06+00:00,da2bqyr,2.0,t1_da2a8s4,2250.0,marvelstudios

That's plenty of time to allow for not only interbreeding but also natural selection.  After many generations, farmers selectively adapt to resist sun burn.  

Another consideration is cosmetics.  Look at Asian kids.  They are darker than their parents, especially their mothers.  My wife literally goes through bottles of skin whitening cream.  Some women even pay to have their skin ""bleached"".  Because dark skin is associated with a rural lifestyle and lower income and education, light skin is considered the standard of beauty in Asia.  Asian people tend to react negatively to black people even going so far as to think they look dirty.

Some women buck the trend.  For example, Asian women visiting America have noticed that Asian women with tans get more attention than those who don't and thus they might want to hang out at a beach or go to a tanning salon.  They may be criticized back home when returning from an overseas vacation with a tan.  Women in Asia tend to use umbrellas in the sun.

Marvel Has Plans for Possible Ghost Rider Netflix Series or Movie

Ghost Rider has made a big comeback thanks to Agents of SHIELD season 4, with actor Gabriel Luna making the new Robbie Reyes version of The Rider a household name. Marvel fans have been so pleased with the reboot that there have been continuous calls to see the new Ghost Rider branch out wider into the Marvel Cinematic Universe - with the most common suggestion being that the character should headline his own Netflix series. 

We here at Comicbook.com had the opportunity to speak with Gabriel Luna (see the video above), and ask about whether a Ghost Rider getting his own Netflix series was even a possibility. According to Luna, it's more than a possibility: there's already structure in place to make it happen. 

Ghost Rider Marvel Movie Netflix Series Gabriel Luna
Regarding how Ghost Rider transitions from Agents of SHIELD to his own solo venture, Luna told us, ""I don't have a preference. People talk about 'Ah man he'd be great as a feature,' which is [an] idea too... It could be in the cinema, it could live on Netflix, whatever it is.""

Getting a little bit more concrete, Luna revealed to us that Marvel Studios has (of course) plotted out the potential for a new Ghost Rider franchise, and has those pathways already structured:

""It's been talked about, there's definitely deals in place for that potential. But I just take it one day at a time. I have so much fun now I just want to make sure I get these episodes right. If they throw more episodes on my plate, I will do my best to do well with those stories as well.""

Marvel fans, would you like to see Luna's Ghost Rider get another shot at a movie franchise? Or (like us) are you hungry for a dark and violent supernatural superhero series on Netflix?",2016-11-14 12:50:39+00:00,d9zq72y,3.0,t1_d9zfrxv,29096.0,Defenders

Actually, they are using the experimenting-on-himself explanation as opposed to the gamma bomb accident as the origin in the movies now anyway.

So they actually could do Supergirl without Superman.  The Supergirl series isn't set in Metropolis so they didn't have to introduce any Superman supporting characters like Jimmy Olsen or Lucy Lane.  They could have changed Supergirl's origin so that she was the only known survivor of Krypton.  No need for Superman.

Same goes for Wonder Girl, I guess.  She doesn't even have to be from Paradise Island. She can just be a gymnast with a black belt in some martial art.  But why call somebody ""Kid Flash"" or ""Aqua Lad"" if there is no Flash or Aquaman?  I suppose you could ask the same thing about the Legion of Super Heroes: you have characters like Lightning Lad and Cosmic Boy when they could have cooler, more adult names.

98,"They literally had four cracks at bringing a Teen Titans / Young Justice show to TV.

Inspired by Smallville and before Gotham became a thing, Grayson was going to explore the journey of an ex-trapeze artist named Dick Grayson who became a vigilante after his parents were killed.  There was also talk of a show called Amazon but neither show made it to the pilot stage.  There was an Aquaman pilot for the CW - and similarly a Wonder Woman for NBC - that never made it to series.

The last season of Smallville introduced Conner Kent who then went to live wit Martha Kent at the farm.  This could have been a backdoor pilot for a Superboy series or it could have been a way to continue Smallville without Tom Welling.  Tom Welling didn't want to wear the Superman suit so Smallville had to end when Clark Kent became Superman.  This prevented any in-universe spin offs.  When Arrow debuted a year later it was basically a reboot of the Smallvile continuity.  

When Smallville was in its final season, there was talk of a series simply titled Raven.  It would follow the life of a girl named Raven going to high school and learning that she is actually the daughter of the extra-dimensional being known as Trigon.  It never made it to pilot.

Finally, there was going to be a TNT Titans series with Nightwing, Starfire, Oracle, Hawk and Dove.  It made it as far as there being a script to the first episode but TNT canned it before a pilot could be filmed saying it ""wasn't for"" them.

Introducing the Teen Titans or Young Justice in live action is problematic.  Look at the Supergirl series.  The existence of Supergirl implies the existence of Superman and Warner Brothers eventually reluctantly agreed to allow Supergir to have its own version of Superman on screen.  Introducing heroes like Nightwing, Wondergirl, Aqualad and Kyle Renner on the CW would similarly imply that Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Green Lantern exist on the CW.  Warner Brothers is dead set against a live action Justice League on the CW.  (Nobody tell them about the cross over in two weeks!)   This severely limits the availability of not only the Justice League members but their supporting characters as well, including side kicks.

101,That's like saying an after credits scene in a movie is part of the movie.  Sometimes it is and sometimes it is just a trailer for the next movie.  Take for example the Ant Man movie (which has been out long enough that I'm not spoiling anything).  It had two after credit scenes.  One was arguably part of the movie and at the same time arguably a set up for Ant Man and the Wasp.  The other was just a scene taken out of Civil War.

Last minute changes to the script to accommodate a premise for the Punisher solo series?  Seriously, it seemed to me that they had wrapped up the Punisher storyline.  When I have time I might go back and listen to what Clancy Brown's character said before he was killed.

Without looking, just going by memory, I think he was just saying that Clancy was angry with Frank Castle for disobeying orders and saving all those men and making him look bad.  This was a call back to when he appeared at Frank Castle's trial and related the story and claimed that he respected Frank Castle for what he did.

Remember?  He said something to the effect of ""He disobeyed a direct order and saved everybody.  I know because I was his commanding officer and it was his order he disobeyed.  But I'm glad he did because I am alive now because of him.""  I'm pretty sure that when he said ""I never forgave you for what you did in Afghanistan"" that he was referring to the story he had already told at the trial.",2016-11-07 13:39:13+00:00,d9pi7rx,2.0,t1_d9pd248,14803.0,Defenders

The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) return to Washington and are surprised to see Marc Spector. Thunderbolt Ross tells them that Spector has overheard intel concerning a plot to bring a nuclear weapon from Kazakhstan to the U.S. He says that the information is limited so the Thunderbolts are going to be on call until the CIA is able to investigate the veracity of this information. He tells them that they are to enjoy a little bit of R&amp;R but to not go too far away and stay in touch.

So, yeah, it’s anti-hero’s night out. Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Marc Spector, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter all go out together for a night on the town. And it isn’t the slightest bit suspicious because they are three men and three women. Shippers will be wetting their pants and, yes, Elektra and the Punisher do get a hotel room and end up in bed together as do Spider-Woman and Marc Spector and Bobbi and Hunter. Bobbi and Hunter are married so it’s no big deal. Jessica and Marc discuss how they are both compelled to do things and how it is making each of them a little bit crazy.

Episode 10

Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Marc Spector, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter are called in by Thunderbolt Ross. Apparently he has new intel.

The big bad is Igor Stravinsky. His group is known as Leviathan. They had ties to the KGB and the Black Widow program and perhaps even the Soviet Winter Soldier program. He tells them that they will need to expect to face enhanced individuals. Their weapons may be useless. They need to train as they have never trained before.

Bobbi organizes time in a gym. The Thunderbolts are trained in hand to hand combat. As most of them are ex-military. this is nothing new to them but Bobbi tells them that the object of this exercise is to have everybody learn from each other.

Thunderbolt Ross calls them in again. The CIA has credible intel as to the bomb’s location are to be shipped out ASAP.

Episode 11

Igor Stravinsky was, of course, a member of Hydra and was involved in the Winter Soldier program. Sebastian Stan appears as the Winter Soldier. We see the Winter Soldier sent out on a mission by Stravinsky. Scarlett Johansson may cameo as the Black Widow.

Years later, after the fall of Hydra, Igor joined Leviathan. They wanted Igor to provide them with super soldiers of their own. They have many recruits. Not all of them survive but he manages to produce a six member team of super soldiers who are all capable of surviving conventional attacks.

Episode 12

The Thunderbolts arrive in Kazakhstan and meet with the local CIA team. They explain to them exactly where the bomb is being hidden and how it is being protected. The CIA operatives explain that they will assist them in penetrating the facility.

The Thunderbolts get past the Leviathan guards. Now they must face the Leviathan super soldiers.

Episode 13

As Ross predicted, guns, knives and batons are not effective against the super soldiers. Venom blasts turn out to be very effective, however, but even at close range they do not kill, only weaken, and Spider-Woman needs time to recharge. Thus the battle rages on for most of the episode.

Ultimately, the Thunderbolts are successful and the CIA takes possession of the nuclear bomb. Obviously the bomb will have to be turned over to the Soviets but the actual terms under which the bomb is returned will have to be negotiated. After all, the Soviets don’t want to have it come out that they allowed a nuclear weapon to fall into the hands of domestic terrorists.

The Thunderbolts return back to Washington. Drug lords in Colombia are dead, hostages were rescued in South East Asia and Africa, terror threats in Egypt and Kazakhstan were eliminated. And yet their names stayed out of the newspapers. Officially, they are all in prison. That means they have done their jobs.

I also have an idea for Season 2 but it requires Kingpin to run for President and win in Daredevil Season 4.  The Thunderbolts have to fight against the US government to take down the entire Fisk administration.  Thing is, who would believe that a corrupt businessman would win the Republican primaries and have a chance to be US President?

150,"Here's my pitch for a Thunderbolts Netflix series.

The Punisher series ends with the Punisher going to jail. Meanwhile, Elektra is brought back to life in the Defenders and Bullseye is introduced and imprisoned at the end of Daredevil Season 3. Each series ends with Thunderbolt Ross propositioning them to join the Thunderbolts.

Episode 1

The episode begins mid res. Elektra, the Punisher, Bullseye and Marc Spector are fighting drug lords in South America.
One week ago, Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye and Marc Spector were recruited by Thunderbolt Ross. They were to be his special ops team. Under no circumstances were they to ever tell anyone who they were working for: their actions overseas will violate international laws and perhaps even be considered acts of war by the US government against the local countries. In particular, their actions could be seen as violating the Sokovia Accords because their abilities are arguably superhuman, But fuck the accords because they were just a way to rein in the Avengers and SHIELD. The United States always has and always will carry out covert missions overseas.

Their first mission: to take out a group of drug lords in Colombia.
The drug lords are easily taken down. It’s like a video game in which guys with guns pop up and are immediately put down.
The episode ends with Thunderbolt Ross talking to an ex-Hydra scientist. The scientist explains to him how Hydra was able to control its operatives. He brings Thunderbolt Ross into a room in which a woman is tied up and sedated. Her name is Jessica Drew. Hydra scientists were able to give her special abilities and use mind control to get her to work for Hydra. Thunderbolt Ross asks if he can fix her. He explains that by “fixing her” he means reversing the mind control. He further explains that by “reversing the mind control” he means getting her to work for him.

Episode 2

Some time ago, SHIELD was able to get intel on Hydra and identify all their active bases. The US government sent troops to all these bases in a coordinated attack. It was not without casualties , however. Jessica Drew aka the Spider-Woman was able to take out several government agents single handedly.

Jessica was recruited by Hyrda and given an experimental formula based on spider venom. Most of the test subjects didn’t survive. Jessica, however, gained the abilities to climb walls and shoot blasts of “venom”which were actually static electric charges that built up in her body over time. She could release the blasts at will most effectively when she came in contact with a person, in which case the blasts could be lethal.

Her costume was bullet proof. Ironically it was tasers that brought her down. She and the other survivors of the assault were imprisoned. Eventually she was brought to Washington. Thunderbolt Ross wanted to get her to work for him.
She was showing signs of progress. She was able to remember her name and who she was. Her back story was similar to that of the Scarlet Witch in that she was from Eastern Europe and her parents were killed in an American airstrike, Ross tells the ex-Hydra scientist to make her forget about that part of her past. Have her instead remember how Hydra turned her into a weapon. Make her believe that it is her job to eliminate similar threats to justice and freedom.

Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye and Marc Spector return from Colombia. He introduces the newest member of their group, the Spider-Woman.

Episode 3

Elektra, the Punisher, Bulleye, Marc Spector and Spider-Woman are sent to Madripore, an island in the South China Sea between the Philippines and Malaysia. When they arrive they are greeted by Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter who explain their mission. Apparently, Thunderbolt Ross recruited Morse and Hunter after they left SHIELD and sent them to Madripore to determine the degree to which local Muslim terrorists are a threat to Western interests. They requested back up and they got the Thunderbolts.
The Muslim terrorists apparently now have Western hostages, including Americans, Europeans and Japanese. They were apparently on a tour of the area. (God knows why: Boracay would be right next door.) Their orders are to go in and take out the terrorists and rescue the hostages.

Of course, things go wrong: Bullseye kills one of the hostages for fun. The Punisher then kills Bullseye by shooting him in the forehead.

Episode 4

Thunderbolt Ross is pissed. Not only did one of the hostages die but one of the team members is dead. He wants to know what happened.

The whole team vouches for the Punisher. Bullseye went off the deep end, they all say, and he killed one of the hostages. The Punisher saw him as a threat no different from the terrorists. He made a call and the other Thunderbolts all support his decision.
Thunderbolt dismissed them. He talks with the ex-Hydra scientist. The ex-Hydra scientist tells him that the group has shown signs of bonding over the incident. He says they have actually exceeded expectations: he wanted a group of mercenaries but he ended up with a team.

Thunderbolt Ross calls them back in. He tells them that their next mission will be in Egypt. Muslim terrorists again only this time operating from a location that could be a threat to Western interests in Europe.

Episode 5

Marc Spector wakes up in a tomb. A statue of the ancient Egyptian god Khonshu is there with him. He passes out again.
The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Marc Spector, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) were sent to Egypt. They attacked the local Muslim terrorist cell but there was an explosion and Marc Spector took the brunt of it. Locals dragged Marc Spector’s body away and placed it in the tomb. Perhaps they thought the Egyptian god Khonshu would bring the foreign soldier back to life.

Marc Spector wakes up again. He hears a voice in his head. We don’t hear it but he does. He believes it is the voice of Khonshu telling him that he is going to be working for him from now on, that he will be the knight of the moon, the Moon Knight.
Marc Spector wanders out of the cave. He has lost contact with the other Thunderbolts and has no choice but to go to the American embassy. Thunderbolt Ross arranges for him to return to Washington where the rest of the team is waiting for him.

When he arrives back in Washington, Marc Spector tells Ross that he wants out, that he doesn’t want to work for Ross anymore.

Episode 6

Marc Spector tells Ross that he has no ill will with Ross or the rest of the team but that he “just can’t do this anymore”. Ross says he understands, that Spector has been through considerable trauma recently and that if he feels it is time for him to retire them the US government will provide him with a healthy severance package. He is provided with a new name and identity: from now on he will be Stephen Grant, resident of Long Island New York. Marc Spector assumes his new identity and moves into his new home. He also gets a job as a New York taxi driver using his real name and a made up resume. People call him “Frenchie”.

Meanwhile, Thunderbolt Ross tells Bobbi that she is now in charge of the Thunderbots. She accepts the new position. He tells her that they are to ship out ASAP for Africa.

Episode 7

The Thunderbolts (Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter) travel to Lagos, Nigeria and meet with their local mission specialist, Jerico Drumm. In the comics, Jerico Drumm is known as Brother Voodoo but here is just an expert on ancient African religions. Apparently, local girls have been kidnapped by one of these cults. They are being used as sex slaves. The government isn’t equipped to deal with them. Thunderbolt is sending the Thunderbolts in exchange for valuable trade benefits for the United States.

Meanwhile, Marc Spector goes to work driving his taxi in the worst parts of New York. In his taxi, hi picks up drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes. He hears things. On some nights, he doesn’t go out as Frenchie. Instead, he goes out as Moon Knight. He doesn’t have a cape: he just has a white suit and a white mask. He also doesn’t want to drive one of Steven Grant’s cars so he drives his taxi and hopes that nobody notices Frenchie wearing a white suit. He then pulls the taxi over, gets out and puts on his Moon Knight mask. Some criminals are going to get their ass whooped.

Episode 8

Elektra, the Punisher, Spider-Woman, Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter are being briefed by Jerico Drumm. Apparently they have learned where the cult is keeping the young girls. Bobbi Morse tells the team that this is to be a stealth mission. She doesn’t want a single hostage to lose her life this time.

Marc Spector is driving his taxi again. He picks up Russian men. Marc puts on a thick French accent. The two Russians get into the cab and start talking as though he wasn’t even there.

What happened is that someone in the Chinese government literally turned on his TV and there was nothing but cheaply made Chinese mystical / occult crap.

249,"1. Reciprocity (The Golden Rule)

2. The Golden Rule can be stated many ways but the most common way it is phrased in English is ""Do unto others as you would have them do to you.""

3. There is a problem with the golden rule, of course.  If you would like people to surprise you when you are walking home and beat you over the head then ""Do unto others as you would have them do to you"" isn't going to work well for you.  People have to follow a certain internal logic.  Perhaps the golden rule would be ""Do unto others as they would want you to do to them.""

4. I think reciprocity works and there is a solid mathematical basis for it called ""Game theory"".  Basically, it can be shown that people who cooperate are ultimately more successful than people who compete.  A real life example would be the astronauts who survived the Apollo 13 mission: they were able to survive by working together.  In business, if you try to undermine your competition then it will ultimately hurt your bottom line.  A zero sum game is a game in which there are winners and losers.  By cooperating instead of competing it is possible for everyone to win.

5. A corollary to the golden rule is that you must always be honest to people.  After all, who wants to be lied to?  Any moral system which would allow people to lie to each other is bound to lead to conflict.",2016-10-09 17:08:43+00:00,d8kmb58,1.0,t3_56lk7j,26832.0,DebateAnAtheist

Willa posts selfies that look as though they were leaked but they were actually posted by her to instragram.

Incidentally, Katy Perry didn't take selfies and she reportedly got angry when her husband (at the time) posted a candid picture of her to social media.

If your religion is based on a religious text rather than concerns over Care vs Harm, fairness vs cheating, liberty vs oppression, in-group loyalty vs betrayal, authority vs subversion and sanctity vs degradation then it cannot truly be called moral.

Given that theists are highly skewed towards a backward orientation from which consideration for fairness, liberty and loyalty are almost entirely absent, how can we construct a stable society in consideration of all individuals? In other words, given the diversity among the different religions of the world, we can only expect them to lead to conflict rather than help form stable societies from a diverse group of people.  In order to truly attain peace we must present moral views that appeal to humanity as a whole as opposed to fundamentalists.",2016-09-27 06:28:25+00:00,d83tdut,1.0,t3_54n6pk,30595.0,TrueAtheism

343,"Well, I wouldn't say it is my ""own work"".  I'm trying to make it flow organically from what has happened before.  The Daredevil series has a bad habit of ethnic stereotypes (Russians, Irish, Mexicans, Japanese, Chinese, etc.)  It's as if Trump were writing.  

In any case, you can go too far worrying about the color of people's skin.  Osama Bin Laden wasn't a good guy just because he wasn't white.  Is it morally wrong to send navy seals to another country to kill someone?  Maybe.  Is it technically an act of war against the local country?  Definitely.  But nobody seems to worry about this even in real life.

There are reasons why I would say this all flows organically.

1) There have been people calling for a Moon Knight series.  This is probably the closest we are going to get.

2) In the comics, Spider-Woman started out as a Hydra agent.  That ship has sailed unless she is introduced using flashbacks.

3) Elektra was a SHIELD agent for a while in the comics.  I wouldn't be against her appearing on Agents of SHIELD along with Bobbi and Hunter.  

4) We are getting a Punisher solo series but I am sceptical about a series with the Punisher killing people for 13 episodes straight.  I would think it would get old after the first episode.  This would be the logical way to continue using the character / actor.

5) Bobbi and Hunter were going to be getting their own show, Marvel's Most Wanted.  They were presumably going to be fugitives.  I think I saw that show.  It was called Nikita.  In any case, having them declared criminals qualifies them to be put on a team with Bullseye, Punisher, Elektra, etc.

6) People have been asking for a Thunderbolts series, especially after Thunderbolt Ross appeared in Civil War.  Thing is, they don't have access to Deadpool and the idea of them rushing to bring back Venom after Spiderman 3 has me going ""God no!"".  

7) Elektra is someone else who could warrant her own series and this is the closest we are going to get to that.  

8) The Punisher and Elektra actually were in the 2012 version of the Thunderbolts.  http://www.craveonline.com/site/195861-punisher-deadpool-venom-and-more-in-thunderbolts-1#!  The Thunderbolts could be seen to naturally flow out of Daredevil and Agents of SHIELD.

9) I don't think the idea of Thunderbolt Ross using superhuman assets is out of character.  In the Incredible Hulk, Ross says ""As far as I am concerned that man's body is the property of the US government.""  He didn't just want to stop the Hulk: he wanted to control him.  This is basically how Emil Blonsky became the Abomination.

10) I really like the idea of the Punisher shooting Bullseye in the forehead.  It is a nice homage to the fact that in the comics the character literally has a bullseye on his forehead.  If they actually went for a comics accurate version of Bullseye's costume it would be screaming for the Punisher to deliver the deserved headshot.",2016-09-24 06:22:17+00:00,d7zvgvm,5.0,t1_d7zdr43,33639.0,marvelstudios

358,"I really have no idea why you aren't doing porn.  You said porn involves having sex with strangers.  Well, working at MacDonald's involves selling hamburgers to strangers.  Basically we come back to the whole idea that sex and porn are somehow wrong and evil which I suspect is a purely religious notion.  If you were Buddhist or Hindu you would object to selling cow meat.

If I were living in California I would want to get into porn.  A lot of guys do, except they aren't looking for guys, they are looking for women like you who they can put on box covers and sell DVDs.  It's hard to believe but we actually do look at the girl's face.  If she is pale and has a big nose and acne scars... ugh.

What you should do is tell a guy you know that you are auditioning for porn and ask him to come with you.  Right there you have overcome your first objection, namely having sex with a stranger.  Have them film a scene with this guy you know and maybe you will both break into the industry.

You should know that most porn stars, male and female, are bisexual.  This is for the convenience of the casting director.  If they are shooting a girl-girl scene or a girl-girl video then they don't want a girl to object.  Same if they are shooting a gay porn video: they want a guy who has already been tested for AIDS and not some random guy off the street.

I, personally, would never do gay porn because I would never want a dick in my ass.  That, apparently, isn't a problem for you.  Nor is it a problem for you to put a dick in your mouth.  If you can put your tongue on a man's dick then you can put your tongue on a woman's pussy.  I imagine a lot of guys here would love to see that.

As for the submissive thing, yeah, that can get a bit boring, but remember that in sex one person is always being dominant while the other person is being submissive.  Have you never been on top?  Because that is an important skill: when guys watch you have sex they actually want to see you have sex, not just see some guys ass move up and down with you on the bottom.

Basically, if you are going to be dominant in a scene then that requires acting.  Again, I think you have that covered.  If half the time you are depressed and putting on a brave face then surely you can do it for half an hour at a time.  You taking a break and crying in the corner will be less of an issue: they just won't film that.  Just  remember you can't slow down the production.

Every man's fantasy is to be with twins so you will find yourself doing scenes with other black women.  Other common themes involve cheating on your husband or seducing your friend's husband or fucking your stepdad, stepbrother, boss or teacher.

385,"I'm a white guy and I like porn in which Black guys bang Asian chicks so I could see why a guy might want to see some black guy bang his Asian wife.  I think there are things to consider.

1) Is the couple in a truly committed relationship?  A guy isn't going to hand off his girlfriend to a guy with a bigger dick.  What reason would she have for coming back?

2) Is the girl into a certain type of guy?  Maybe she always wanted to bang a black guy and her parents would never have approved of such a relationship.  Think of it as a gift.  What is she going to get HIM when it is HIS birthday?  Some guys might fantasize about banging another girl in front of his wife but most girls wouldn't go for it.

3) Maybe the wife wants DP.  Maybe the wife wants a dick in her pussy and her mouth.  I couldn't imagine anybody only watching while his wife got fucked.  At the very least he is going to masturbate.

4) As other people have said, there may be a taboo about interracial sex that makes people want to experience it.  Confession time: I have only ever been with a white woman once.  Every other time I have had sex it was with a black woman or an Asian woman.  I didn't enjoy the white girl at all. 

5) It is not as easy for a man to get as aroused as you might think.  Young men suffer from performance anxiety: they are thinking too much about whether they are doing it right to maintain a hard on.  Older men simply get tired.  Watching your wife get fucked could be a way of living out an orgy fantasy without having to have a lot of people show up.  

6) Furthermore, men rely a lot on visual stimulation.  They are aroused by what they see.  A lot of men are going to think of heir favorite porn star, actress, singer or supermodel while having sex with their wife.  Watching their wife have sex may mean a man will actually think about his wife next time they are having sex.",2016-09-10 01:54:35+00:00,d7gh5zn,1.0,t3_51yt67,27757.0,DreamFuck

It is also possible to know you are dreaming and still have a nightmare which kind of makes the nightmare a lot less scary and more like a form of personal entertainment.

I wish I could just change the channel, so to speak, but it isn't that easy.  Taking control of my dream usually causes me to wake up.

402,"&gt; It caused me to lose my job.

Okay, I know this is none of my business but how did your depression cause you to lose your job?  Did you not show up for work?  Was there an incident at work?  I ask because if you are getting therapy then that would be with a doctor and he could write a note saying you are getting ""treatment"".  Most people would respect this and consider taking you back.

To be honest, most black girls [and most white girls for that matter] are a bit chubby.  You are definitely somebody who could attract attention.  If you can't go back to the club where you were working then perhaps you can go to another club with a different clientele.  It could even mean more money.  You can say you worked at another club and you didn't like it there and that it drove you crazy working there.  You wouldn't be lying.

Now, be honest, was dancing at a club CONTRIBUTING to your depression?  Did you feel worthless having men stare at your naked body?  I wonder because you were reluctant to say that you had gotten a job at a club as if you were ashamed.  Seriously, you were ashamed to tell US who (I confess) are really only here to see you naked.  I wonder if you didn't want to see your friends and family because they didn't know what you were doing and you were afraid they would ask if you had a job.  Further evidence is that you say you would like to do porn but you don't just go to a porn studio and do porn.  Are you afraid your friends and family would find out if you did?  

&gt; I am considering entering therapy and possibly trying a psychiatric medication. (After a bad experience with a particular psych med about a year ago...)

See, now, this confuses me.  If you have never had therapy then it sounds as if you were taking psychiatric medication without consulting a doctor.  This is dangerous.  Even if you don't plan to overdose you can easily accidentally overdose because the medication isn't working for you so you decide to take more.  You should only take medication on a doctor's advice, you should only take the dosage that the doctor recommends and if you consult more than one doctor then you should tell them about what medication you are already taking: don't lie to your doctor just so the doctor will give you a larger prescription because that's another way you can overdose.",2016-09-05 04:50:24+00:00,d79xv2v,1.0,t3_517d1q,7786.0,DreamFuck

So you are making the analogy between emotional strength and physical strength.

We get physically tired when we have exerted ourselves.  By analogy, we would get emotionally drained when we have a lot to worry about.  A lot of people not only have to worry about themselves but also their friends and family, their job, their hobbies, etc.

As I have already said, you really don't have that much to worry about.  By your own admission, your problems are all in your head.

People develop physical strength through exercise.  By analogy we expect people to develop emotional strength through hardship.

428,"You said ""in this case"" cry for attention means... and then you gave your own personal definition of what a cry for attention means.  Don't pretend to be a professional psychologist.  Besides, you originally said that depression ""doesn't have to be a cry for attention"" so you originally acknowledged that depression often is a cry for attention.  In reality, people who say they are going to commit suicide are seeking attention: people who genuinely want to kill themselves are not going to tell everybody they are going to do it; they want people to talk them out of it, obviously.  The danger, of course, is that they might actually commit suicide just to prove that they were serious.

Stop being a total prick.  If she really needs help then she should consult a professional.  All we can do is give her the attention she wants.

499,"Favorites

Kurea Hasumi - First, there's the ass.  Then there's the face.  I like that she doesn't look like a young girl.  Too much Japanese porn is devoted to schoolgirls and she tends to play the teacher.  She's not old.  She's just the right age.  And then there's that slutty attitude.  And she always laughs when someone cums as if it is a complete surprise to her.

Ai Uehara - Again, it is the slutty attitude.  I'm sorry but she isn't really all that physically attractive.  She is pretty, yes, but she looks a bit young by Western standards.  I like it when she makes a guy cum and she keeps going as if she expects him to cum again.

Yui Hatano - It really comes down to her facial expressions.  She isn't really all that attractive to me.  She actually errs on the side of looking too old.  But she is a consummate entertainer.  The look on her face is one of pure ecstasy.  If watching her fuck doesn't make you cum then you are either gay or dead.

Yuki Jin - I can stare at that ass for hours.  In fact, I have.  I can stare at that ass after I have already cum and then come again.  And when she actually has sex with a guy my reaction is ""On my god she is actually going to let this guy fuck her!"" and it gives me hope that I could also fuck her.

Haruki Sato - She is kind of plain looking but she is a good actress.  Too many Japanese pornos have guys pulling down their pants and the girls treat it as another day at work.  Which it is.  But that's not acting.  If Haruki does a scene she looks surprised when the dick appears which adds to the realism.  There's no point the movies having a plot if the actresses aren't going to take things seriously.

Minori Hatsune - I'm sorry but hers are a perfect set of tits.

Aika - I like brown skin.  And she has a pretty face.

Naomi - Physically, she is just perfect.  I can't comment on her performances, however, because I tend to cum a few minutes into her movies.

Least favorites

Hitomi Tanaka - The tits are way too big and they sag which makes her look old.

Anri Okita - Her face is way too puffy.  When she was in a movie with Kurea Hasumi it was as if she wasn't there.  I was completely focused on Kurea.",2016-08-08 13:06:48+00:00,d68y7ey,1.0,t3_4wn0tg,53427.0,JavDownloadCenter

I mean, let's face it, the story wasn't finished: at the end of Winter Soldier, Captain America and the Falcon discussed going after the Winter Soldier.  That was an obvious set up for Captain America 3.  We also know that Feige wanted to use the title ""Civil War"" for Captain America 3 but there was some concern as to how closely they could follow the Civil War story from the comics.  

Remember that Robert Downey Jr. had signed on for six movies, namely three Iron Man movies and three Avengers movies.  It was understood that Robert Downey Jr. wouldn't be coming back for Iron Man 4 because his contract would be over with Infinity War Part II.  So how could they do the Civil War storyline?  Ike Perlmutter even went so far as to tell Feige not to have Robert Downey Jr. in Captain America 3 because he would be too expensive and it wasn't until Feige successfully lobbied to Disney to have Ike removed as Feige's boss that Feige was able to do an actual adaption of the Civil War story from the comics.  So to say that they were ""talking about doing Civil War ever since they finished Captain America 2"" is completely wrong on multiple levels: they were talking about Captain America 3 long before they finished filming Captain America 2 but there were a lot of obstacles preventing them from doing the Civil War storyline.  And I'm not even talking about them wanting to use Spider-Man.

It really isn't that hard to understand.  We really have no idea when Feige got the go ahead to use the title Civil War for Captain America 3.  It is entirely possible that the Serpent Society was a real possibility at one point.  We literally have no idea.  We have no idea exactly what was said in private and we rely on interviews that have come out after the fact.  For all we know Feige was using the announcement of the Phase 3 line up to not only generate excitement for the Phase 3 movies but as a way to pressure Ike into agreeing to have him make the movies he wanted to make.  We now realize that it was Ike that wanted the Inhumans movie and as soon as Ike was out of the picture Inhumans was dropped from Phase 3.",2016-08-07 06:03:57+00:00,d67j7w8,13.0,t1_d67hhyz,4088.0,marvelstudios

533,"""Don't tell me about your problems.  Tell me about your solutions."" -- Popular saying

Obviously the Punisher needs to be treated as a stand alone series and its production and scheduling should not delay Daredevil Season 3 (which won't come out until 2018 no matter what we do because the cast will be busy filming the Defenders series).  It's frustrating.  Maybe we will hear more when the Luke Cage series comes out in two months time.

""For whatever reason, Marvel has opted to produce only one project at a time, with minimal overlap.""

It's not a big mystery.  Marvel hires the same crew to shoot each series.  The director of photography has been the same person on each series so they can't possibly shoot series at the same time (although they can be in production at the same time).  They need to hire new people without reducing the quality of their output.  They might have to shoot in locations outside of New York.

""I'm told DD season 2, which I haven't yet watched, left a number of dangling plot threads that need to be addressed,""

You need to watch Daredevil Season 2 before you watch Defenders.  The Defenders promotional material strongly suggests that the Defenders will pick up where Daredevil Season 2 left off.  

""LUKE CAGE s1 has been finished for some time now but Marvel and Netflix have opted to sit on it until nearly October, which just increases the time its cast and crew will have to wait before work begins on any second season.""

Iron Fist is still filming and it will imeediately be followed with the filming of Defenders which will immediately be followed with the filming of Jessica Jones Season 2.  As the same actors are going to appear in all three series (given that cameos are to be expected at this point) they can hardly up their schedule.  The only leeway they have is with the Punisher: Frank Castle hasn't even been confirmed to be in Defenders.

""its crew will have been left idle for nearly a year-and-a-half""

You are assuming that the crews for Iron Fist, Defenders and Jessica Jones are all different.  This is not the case.  While the crews are busy filming other series, the writers are busy writing a thirteen episode arc and that takes time.

I suspect there is a lot riding on the Punisher series.  If the Punisher can be put into production soon and the quality is as good as the other Marvel Netflix shows then Netflix will allow Marvel to produce more shows.  Wesley Snipes said ""The ball is in Marvel's court.""  It's not.  Netflix wants to know that the quality of the shows can be maintained before they order any more.",2016-07-30 07:15:04+00:00,d5wy5cs,1.0,t3_4v29jc,131749.0,Daredevil

579,"I know what he is saying.  He is saying that the original Sumerian myths were rewritten so that there was one god rather than many and when necessary the other gods were referred to as angels and demons so that God would be the only actual god in the story.  Examples include the Sumerian myth of the gods (plural) creating the first man (Adama) or the myth about a god created the great flood and another god warming Noah that it was coming.  There's also the character of Nimrod who was a fallen angel in the Bible but a demigod in Sumerian myth and King Gilgamesh in actual history.  The best example is probably Baal which is a Hebrew word meaning Lord.  It was used to refer to the Sumerian god Tammuz who was said to rise from the dead every spring.  In the Bible he was a false god and a demon.  In history he was the husband of the Sumerian queen Ishtar.

(Empire Strikes Back gets mentioned.) Towards the end, the guy in the metal flying suit crashes into the ground and you think he is dead.

First, Ghost Rider and Blade are existing franchises whereas Midnight Sons is not.  It is better to reintroduce Blade and Ghost Rider in their own series.  This would also avoid confusion as to whether the series are a continuation of the movies.  They need to retell the origins of Blade and Ghost Rider.  I would bring back Wesley Snipes and Nicholas Cage in supporting roles and have new actors play Blade and Johnny Blaze.  Wesley Snipes has all but said that Marvel is going to recast Blade while he would be in a supporting role.

I would want the show runner for the Punisher to work on Moon Knight.  Punisher Season 2 could pit the Punisher and Moon Knight at odds.

Meanwhile, Blade and Ghost Rider would meet in the Defenders Season 2.  Imagine if Blade and Stick were to hunt for Ghost Rider with the Defenders in the middle and then when all the misunderstandings are cleared up Mephisto appears and Blade.

613,"It's a lot more complicated than that.  For example, Smallville couldn't use Barry Allen because WB had plans for a Flash movie.  

Incidentally, the CW came into existance in 2006 when the UPN and WB networks folded.  They each had hit shows, namely America's Next Top Model and Smallville.  The 2001-2006 Seasons of Smallville were broadcast by the WB and the 2006-2011 Seasons were broadcast by the CW.  Alfred Gough and Miles Millar were the showrunners for Seasons 1-7 but then they quit working the show.  Reportedly, this was because DC was giving them a hard time over the portrayal of characters on the show, especially their Jimmy Olsen who was supposed to be much younger than Superman and not almost the same age.

Arrow has also had trouble obtaining rights to characters.  For example, they were allowed to use Deadshot, Bronze Tiger and Amanda Waller for Seasons 2-3 but when the Suicide Squad movie was greenlit these characters all had to be killed off on Arrow.  Fortunately, the Flash is a hit show because otherwise it would have been cancelled to make room for the movie.  WB was also reluctant to let the CW use the Justice Society because they feared that viewers would confuse the Justice Society with the Justice League and expect to see Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc.  

We still don't know if Superman will appear in costume on Supergirl or if he will just be Clark Kent.  Another big question is Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern.  Smallville wasn't allowed to use Alan Scott in its Justice Society two parter so the CW still might not be able to use him.

Meanwhile, Valkyrie probably cannot lift Thor's hammer as few people would be ""worthy"" enough to lift it.  It would make much more sense for the Vision to use it.

As for Captain America, killing him off wouldn't make sense either because the current Avengers line up are going to need to train a younger team of Avengers including Spider-Man, Nova, Quasar, Kate Bishop, White Tiger, Ms. Marvel, Patriot, She-Hulk, etc.  It makes sense from Marvel's point of view to keep Chris Evans and RDJ around and put their names and faces on posters even though the younger stars are going to be doing all the action scenes.",2016-07-08 04:20:56+00:00,d53uk04,1.0,t3_4rs8kw,8941.0,Avengers

687,"Punisher has been confirmed to be filming in 2017 so the actual release date may be 2018. How can they start filming without having cast the other characters? Do they even have a script? Are they using the same film crew that has done the other Marvel Netflix shows? What about locations? They need to scout locations before they can begin filming.

Daredevil Season 2 came out in March and Luke Cage will come out in September so that means Iron Fist will come out in March and Defenders will come out in September. Defenders may be a shorter season but they are likely to face a supernatural threat and that means more time spent on production. Nevertheless, a shorter filming schedule would give them more time to film The Punisher so it could come out early in 2018.

HOWEVER, Jessica Jones is already confirmed to be filming in 2017 after The Defenders wraps. That could push the filming of The Punisher back UNLESS they hire a whole new crew to film the Punisher in which case they could film Jessica Jones and The Punisher at the same time. That would still push back the release of The Punisher because they announced Jessica Jones already and announced that filming on Jessica Jones would begin as soon as filming on The Defenders wraps.

715,"Um, no, Marvel is going to go ahead with Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 and Spider-Man 2 and probably Ant Man 3, Dr. Strange 2, Black Panther 2 and Captain Marvel 2.  Then they will probably have Black Widow, Valkyrie and She-Hulk movies.  The Avengers in Phases 5-6 will probably be Spider-Man, Valkyrie, She-Hulk, Ms. Marvel, Nova, Quasar, White Tiger, Patriot, Stature, Kate Bishop and maybe Miles Morales and we may see Ms. Marvel, Nova, Quasar and White Tiger movies.  Marvel would be crazy not to do an Iron Man 4.  The Scarlet Witch could have her own Dark Phoenix arc in Avengers 5.  And we haven't had any time travel in the MCU yet.  They have decades of stories to tell.

Similarly, the X-Men franchise is definitely doing Wolverine 3, Deadpool 2, New Mutants and X-Force and may be doing Gambit and X-Men: Reboot (set in the 1990s).  X-Men: Reboot is supposed to be the start of a new trilogy and will presumably involve Proteus and Mister Sinister.  X-23 is being introduced in Wolverine 3 and may appear next in New Mutants and/or X-Force.  If Mister Sinister appears in X-Men: Reboot then we might see Madelyne Prior in the sequels.  I don't want to see the Shiar or Dark Phoenix again.

So the MCU and the X-Men franchise are doing well enough on their own.  That doesn't mean they can't have a crossover.  The obvious choice would be to have Mojo be the villain... but... I would rather they didn't have an Avengers / X-Men crossover than they made a shitty movie for the sake of a crossover.

732,"Powers

Enhanced Human: Patsy Walker has a near-superhuman level of physical prowess, including strength, speed, agility, endurance, and reflexes. Originally the Cat costume was designed to enhanced the natural prowess of any woman who wore it. Over time, Patsy discovered that her physical abilities remained heightened even outside of her Cat costume.

Titanian Enhancements: Patsy once possessed enhanced psionic abilities, due to the mental stimulation of Moondragon's Titanian technology. She could move small objects telekinetically, resist mental control, and on one occasion was able to generate a psychokinetic force-blast. Moondragon has since used her own advanced psionic powers to undo the effects of her psychic augmenter. Since then, Walker’s psychic abilities have returned but to a far lesser degree than at their peak. She no longer has any psychokinetic ability, but she is still sensitive to certain psychic phenomena. She can see into the infrared spectrum, detect mystical energy from a distance, and see through certain glamours or illusions.

Costume Summoning: Since returning from the dead, Hellcat has had the ability to summon her Hellcat costume on command, magically exchanging it for whatever clothing she was wearing at the time. She could also customize the costume design when it appeared.

761,"No, I just think that the movie needs to acknowledge the fact that Bucky is still on ice there.  It is a good jumping off point that can lead to different conflicts.  Having Everet Ross find out about Bucky and calling for his extradition is one way to go.  It would also lead to other conflicts.  T'Challa would be under pressure from his own people to hand over Bucky.  Then there's Ulysses Klaue.  We don't know how he will factor in.  Logically, it would be the Avengers who would go after him, unless of course he comes back to Wakanda.  I'm not sure why he would do that, unless of course it is because he knows a doctor who can give him a prosthetic hand and he can only be found in Wakanda.  Anyway, I'm not sure how the different plot points could fit together.  The final battle should be a show down between Klaw and T'Challa.  Maybe Klaw with his money can hire other mercenaries and we can have a proto-Masters of Evil.  I don't know.  I imagine the bulk of the film will focus on T'Challa himself and there will be plot points that will be picked up in Avengers 3.  

Personally, I think it would make sense if T'Challa decided that the will of the Wakandan people was to have Bucky turned over to the Americans and Avengers 3 started with Bucky on trial for his crimes.  In fact, T'Challa could strike a deal with General Ross and have Captain America and the others granted amnesty in exchange for him turning over Bucky.  That would be a win.  So Captain America and the others could return to America and see Bucky get his day in court.  That could be the B plot of Avengers 3 while Thanos is gathering the infinity stones.  The big action piece of Avengers 3 would have to be the part where Thanos rips the mind gem from the Vision's head.  Presumably he would have one more gem to get and him getting that last gem would be the B plot of Captain Marvel.  And then Thanos would have the completed Infinity Gauntlet at the beginning of Avengers 4.   At that point it is hard to predict how things will go down.  That's why they haven't announced any Phase 4 movies: we know that Thanos is going to be defeated but they want us to think that he just might be able to destroy everything and everyone and win.",2016-06-15 08:55:25+00:00,d49yd0y,5.0,t1_d49xfqk,3147.0,marvelstudios

The Caretaker tells Johnny about a prophesy that a boy was born on Earth and he is the son of Mephistopheles.  The Caretaker tells Johnny to go after the boy and kill him unless Mephistopheles agrees to lift the curse.  The boy is Danny Ketch.  Johnny can't bring himself to kill Danny.  Mephistopheles starts torturing Johnny.  That's when Danny turns on fire.  Danny and Johnny fight Mephistopheles and defeat him.  Danny has it in his power to destroy Mephistopheles.  Now the deal is that Johnny gets to live a normal life and be with the woman he loves and Mephistopheles agrees but Mephistopheles double crosses Danny because now it is Danny who must become the rider whenever he is in the presence of evil.  The series ends with Danny as the new rider.  

In Ghost Rider Season 2, Danny tries to make a go of things.  After all, he is much more powerful than Johnny ever was and he can make short work of evil doers and turn back into Danny before anyone knows he is gone.  Thus he tries to live a normal life.  In Defenders Season 2, Danny meets Patsy Walker and they become an item.  So now Danny is an amalgam of Danny Ketch and Damien Hellstorm.  As the son of Mephistopheles, he is able to grant her heightened strength so that she is now almost as strong as Jessica.  She assumes the identity of Hellcat.  Jessica does not approve so she and Danny fight.  Patsy has to separate them.  The three of them end up teaming up to fight the big bad, someone powerful like Nightmare or Mephisto or Dormandu but someone who can be defeated easily enough by Danny who is, after all, the son of Mephistopheles.

790,"""This is an accord that deals with the Avengers and the Avengers alone.""

""But we're not the Avengers any more.""

""Say what?""

""We're the REvengers.""

""Oh.  Okay then.  Carry on.""

Obviously the Sokovian Accords apply to any superteam.  It isn't clear how the Sokovian Accords would apply to Daredevil in Season 1 though.  I mean, when Daredevil arrested Kingpin at the end, it was a citizen's arrest of a known fugitive.  Very cut and dried and perfectly legal.

Daredevil's activities in Season 2 would have been covered by the accords.  Stick clearly had a lot of people working for him and he was operating in different countries.  Elektra killed a few people.  And the final battle had ninjas who were stabbed or shot in the head and at least one which was decapitated.  

Jessica Jones needn't worry.  She is a private investigator and she has no secret identity.  If Danny and Luke form Heroes for Hire like in the comics then they would be registered as a business and they would surely be covered under the accords.  Daredevil would not be allowed to work for them, however, unless he revealed his identity.  The same goes for Spider-Man.

I don't think Tony Stark even read the accords because something tells me that hiring a minor and bringing him overseas on an Avengers mission would have been a no no.  He may even have been violating both existing child labor laws and Geneva conventions against using children as soldiers.  Geez.

As a bare minimum, the government needs to know who you are and what you can do before you can be approved to go on missions.  Imagine if Tony recruited a ""hero"" called A-Bomb Man who then decides that the way to defeat Thanos is to nuke him from orbit.  That would kind of violate the spirit of the accords.

The accords can't just apply to the Avengers.  They have to apply to any organisation that can hire super powered people.  It isn't clear how they would apply to vigilantes like Daredevil or Spider-Man but if they were to join the Avengers or SHIELD or Heroes for Hire then Thadeus Ross would want to know who they are and what they can do.",2016-06-12 02:23:03+00:00,d45kaq7,1.0,t3_4nldf9,46696.0,shield

Luke Cage loses the fight and the story appears on TV which then gets the attention of Captain Marvel or Namor or Valkyrie who goes after the troublemaker.  Thus Luke Cage's appearance is part of the plot and not just a cameo.  Details like that have to be ironed out when the movie is first being pitched: the story needs to flow.

806,"Whizzer (Rober Frank)- No.  I don't want Marvel to revisit the 40s.

Namor the Sub-Mariner - Sure.  For old time's sake, I would want to see a Doctor Strange movie in which he enlists the help of him and the Hulk and perhaps a few other characters.  They couldn't call themselves the Defenders though.  Or maybe he also enlists the help of Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist and then Marvel can have it both ways and literally have the Hulk and Namor join forces with Doctor Strange and the Defenders.

Black Knight (Dane Whitman) - I don't know.  Visually, the character looks cool in the comics but in live action he would look silly.  I just can't imagine how Marvel could make the character work.

Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew) - Sure.  Most likely on Agents of SHIELD.  Holden Radcliffe is a High Evolutionary type.  He might be the one who creates Spider-Woman because her father asks him to save her life like in the comics.  

Alpha Flight - Alpha Flight are almost certainly optioned by Fox.  Yes, Marvel could use Department H and they could have a team of Canadian heroes but Fox could easily complain that Marvel was using Alpha Flight without calling them Alpha Flight.  I suppose it could be a similar situation with Quicksilver where Quicksilver has been a member of the Avengers but also a member of X-Factor and the X-Men.  But having two different actors playing Quicksilver is one thing and having two different versions of Alpha Flight is another.  A similar situation occurred with the CW and WB both wanting to do the Suicide Squad with the CW caving in to make room for the movie version.

Moon Knight (Marc Spector) - Well, there are rumors.  Perhaps the show runner who is working on the Punisher is also working on Moon Knight.  There could also be somebody secretly working on Blade and Ghost Rider.  Netflix might be waiting to see how Punisher turns out.  These shows aren't cheap and right now Netflix is only committed to two shows a year.  If the rumors are true, Marvel would want Netflix to double their commitment.  Right now, we don't even know when they are going to start production on the Punisher.

Fantastic Four - Reportedly Marvel has contingencies in case Fox hands them back the Fantastic Four.  I know they wanted the Silver Surfer. 

Hercules - ""Another 'God' character such as Thor""  Yes, which is why introducing another pantheon of gods just so that they could introduce a character similar to one they already have would be pointless.  Most likely Valkyrie is being introduced as a replacement for Thor after Infinity War.  After all, Thor has no reason to stay on Earth if he and Jane Foster have split up.  The next Thor movie may not even have Thor coming to Earth.  Thor will return for Infinity War and maybe in another Avenger movie or two down the road but if Odin is dead then Thor will have no choice but to be king of Asgard.

Spectrum (Monica Rambeau) - There are literally thousands of Marvel characters.  We don't need to add a character simply for diversity sake.

Starfox (Eros) - Well, Kurt Russell would make an excellent Starfox but there are rumors that he will be playing Starhawk instead.  Either character would make sense as the father of Starlord.

Shang-Chi - Shang Chi has ties to Heroes for Hire and to SHIELD.  I expect him to show up on Netflix or on ABC but I'm not holding my breath.

Nova (Richard Rider) and Quasar (Wendell Vaughn) - Yeah, as Robert Downey Jr and Don Cheadle get too old to play Iron Man and War Machine there is going to be pressure both in story and in real life for them to be replaced with younger characters played by younger actors.  Presumably, Tony will modify technology he finds on Xandar and on the Kree homeworld and build new suits and he and Rhodey would train Richard and Wendall to use the suits because they are getting too old to carry on as Iron Man and War Machine (until the next Avengers movie).

Demolition Man (Dennis Dunphy) or Swordsman(Jacques Duquesne) - No.  With Spider-Man and Valkyrie, Marvel has begun the process of introducing new young characters.  That will be their priority for Phase 4.

Darkhawk (Christopher Powell) and X-51 (Machine Man/Aaron Stack) - They are just too similar to Iron Man and Vision.  Now, granted, Vision might not survive Infinity War Part 1 but we want Iron Man to stick around for a while.  Tell you what, wait another 30 years and the actors playing Nova and Quasar will themselves be getting old and a new generation of young Avengers will be needed.

Hyperion (Marcus Milton) - ""Essentially Marvel's Answer to Superman""  No.

Young Avengers - Besides Nova, Quasar, Spider-Man and Valkyrie, they need to add more young characters.  Other people have mentioned She Hulk, White Tiger, Jocasta and Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan).   They could also introduce Clea in a future Doctor Strange movie.  They also need a new character and actor to replace Captain America and Chris Evans and that might as well be Patriot.  Similarly, Hawkeye and Jeremy Renner would be replaced by Kate Bishop played by a younger actress.  Eventually Cassie Lang can follow in her father's footsteps and become Stature.  Hell, one day they will even replace Peter Parker with Miles Morales simply because Tom Holland will be getting too old.  They can go on for decades this way.

836,"The dagger dates back to the 14th century BC and is one of very few iron artifacts ever found from the ancient Egyptian culture, which isn't thought to have developed iron smelting until the 8th century BC — later than neighbouring countries, Comelli told CBC News in an email.

""The problem with iron working is related to its high melting point (1,538 C). Because of it, early smiths couldn't heat ore enough to extract iron and couldn't forge the iron into weapons,"" she wrote.

Earlier iron objects were typically ornamental or ceremonial and made of meteoritic iron that was considered more valuable than gold, the researchers wrote.

It was shaped by hammering, Comelli said. King Tut's dagger had been suspected to have been made with that type of iron, but it had not been confirmed.

""In this context, the high manufacturing quality of Tutankhamun's dagger blade is evidence of early successful iron smithing in the 14th C. BCE,"" the researchers wrote in their paper.

They added that the finding also provides insight into Egyptian descriptions of iron that appeared around 100 years later, which use the term ""iron of the sky.""

850,"Here's what we know.

1) The Punisher is coming. It has a show runner.

2) No date for the release of the Punisher has been announced. No details as to casting (other than Jon Bernthal) have been announced. No plot has been announced.

3) Blade, Moon Knight and Ghost Rider shows are only rumored. However, Wesley Snipes has said he was approached by Marvel to appear in a Blade ""project"". He said that Marvel was concerned about his age and he said that they were considering for a supporting role. He may be playing a version of Whistler (the Kris Kristofferson character from the movies). This makes me wonder if they could get Nicholas Cage to play The Caretaker / Carter Slade.

4) The Defenders is being filmed in New York. So far, the New York crew has been busy with Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Daredevil Season 2, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, the Defenders and Jessica Jones Season 2. Each show has different writers, producers and stars but it is the same crew that shoots all the Marvel Netflix series in New York and they are busy with the series they are currently making. They will need to hire a new crew if they are going to film Punisher, Blade, Moon Knight and Ghost Rider. Marvel may be scouting locations outside of New York. Hiring an entirely new crew in New York and then filming in new York may be prohibitively expensive.

5) Marvel Knights is not an official title. Most likely Defenders Season 2 will include other characters besides Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist.

6) There will be a Jessica Jones Season 2. There might be a Daredevil Season 3, a Luke Cage Season 2 and an Iron Fist Season 2. There might even be a Jessica Jones Season 3 before Defenders Season 2.

7) Right now they are just putting out two shows a year. They would probably continue to do that for the shows they are doing now and continue to film them in New York in the interest of maintaining quality. They could put out four shows a year but it would obviously be with a new crew filming the new shows. The quality of the new shows would not necessarily be less than that of the quality of the current shows. Compare Flash Season 2 which was shot in Vancouver to Supergirl Season 1 which was shot in Los Angeles.

880,"Somebody needs to pitch a Marvel / DC crossover movie.  Of course, it wouldn't be canon.  Here's my idea.

Who Framed Rocket Racoon?

So, in the movie, Rocket Racoon is an actual talking Racoon who was hired to play Rocket in the movie Guardians of the Galaxy.  He is in negotiations with ABC to film a pilot for a spin off TV show.  ABC and his agent are trying to hammer out a premise for the show.  Rocket wants the network to do a show about him and Groot but the network says they can't afford to have a CGI character appear in every episode.  Krysten Ritter plays Rocket's love interest.  The shit hits the fan when one of Rocket's potential co-stars is found dead and the police find raccoon fur on the body.  Krysten Ritter goes to see Eddie Valient (played by Steve Buscemi).  Krysten explains that she isn't really a detective and nor does she actually have superpowers.  They need someone who can investigate because the police think Rocket did it.

Valient's theory is that Warner Brothers are the only people with both motive and opportunity to destroy the reputation of Rocket and, by extension, Marvel Studios and Disney.  Valient goes to visit the Warners Studios lot and various DCEU actors make cameo appearances.  Warner Brothers executives bristle at the thought of being accused of a crime and throw Valient off the lot.

Valient takes his theory to the media and the Marvel / DC and, by extension, Warners / Disney rivalry gets discussed on all the major news and talk shows.  It gets so bad that Henry Cavill and Chris Evans (amongst others) come to blows at a Comic Con.

In the end, Valient manages to prove that Guillermo del Toro was the mastermind behind it all and that it was all a plan to discredit Marvel and DC so that he could get funding for Hellboy 3.

The end.

Seriously, if Disney could get permission from Warners to do Who Framed Roger Rabbit? in 1988 then 30 years later they can get permission to do Who Framed Rocket Racoon?",2016-05-31 12:31:16+00:00,d3qanx8,1.0,t3_4lrmzv,55326.0,DC_Cinematic

http://www.wsj.com/articles/for-hollywood-not-all-box-office-dollars-are-equal-1409241925

""The cut of each box office dollar that studios take varies from as little as 25 cents in China to about 50 cents in the U.S.""

So, let's estimate that BvS made $440m domestically and $440m overseas.  Thats $220m and $110m for the studio which add up to about $80m over budget which may not be enough to cover marketing.

Variety claims that the total cost of the movie including marketing could reach $400m.

Berlanti, Kriesburg, Guggenheim and Johns were all in big trouble when the Green Lantern movie failed.  DC corporate thought David Goyer was the right person to guide the movies but after Batman v Superman underperformed at the box office they have brought Johns and Berlanti back.  They look at the success of Arrow, the Flash, Supergirl and Legends and suddenly Green Lantern doesn't seem so bad.

David Goyer had written Flash and Green Arrow movies but when Green Lantern failed they did Man of Steel instead.

907,"Well, we have Iron Man, War Machine, Captain America, Falcon, Thor, Hulk, Ant Man, Clint Barton, Captain Marvel and Black Panther now but in the future we will probably have Nova, Quasar, Spider-Man, Patriot, Valkyrie, She-Hulk, Stature, Kate Bishop, Ms. Marvel and White Tiger.  In fact, at least two of these characters (Spider-Man and Valkyrie) are already being introduced in Phase 3.  All the characters we currently have are going to age out of their roles and Marvel is already replacing them with new characters.  It is no accident that the new Spider-Man was introduced in a Captain America movie and Valkyrie will be introduced in a Thor movie: these new characters are going to headline their own movies.  

No, I don't see a Patriot movie coming but I can imagine the Patriot character taking over Cap's shield.  In fact, the Patriot character could be introduced as early as Infinity War because Captain America gave up his shield in Civil War.  There is a 99% probability of Captain America getting a new shield made of vibranium as a gift from the Black Panther.  We may even see new Captain America and Iron Man movies in Phase 4 although I think the priority is for them to make a Black Widow movie because I think after Civil War the focus needs to not always be on Captain America, Thor and Iron Man and I think a Black Widow movie could be Marvel's answer to Deadpool if they have most of the movie be a flashback to her early career as a KGB assassin and as an agent of SHIELD.

908,"A Blade v Ghost Rider season makes sense especially if they take the fight to the streets of New York and other heroes get involved.  That could be the premise for Defenders 2.  To Blade, Ghost Rider is just a demon that needs to be taken down.  Maybe Stick, Daredevil and Elektra side with Blade and Luke, Danny and Jessica have made friends with Johnny Blaze.  The fight is brief but there is a moment where Matt assumes his friends are possessed by Mephistopheles.  Everybody teams up when Mephistopheles actually does show up to make trouble.

Then there's the Punisher.  The second season should start in New York but then Frank needs to get out of town because he is a fugitive.  He needs to make up an assumed name and find a job.  One assumes that the hacker Micro can help him get a false ID.  Anyway, Frank needs to try to live a normal life but then shit goes down and he needs to kill a lot of people.  At the end of the season he needs to move on again.

Season 2 of the Punisher has him leaving the country and going to Canada and eventually teaming up with Moon Knight.  One way he can get into Canada with guns is if he fakes Native American heritage.  One little known fact is that the Iroquois people can freely cross the Canada / US border.  If Micro supplies him with a false ID he can enter Canada with his ""hunting"" rifle.  Maybe he is after somebody that Moon Knight also knows.  Maybe the guy he is after is an old friend of Marc Spector from when he was a mercenary so at first Punisher and Moon Knight come into conflict but then Punisher is able to show him that his old friend is up to no good.  They join forces under the condition that Punisher doesn't simply kill everybody.  I would set Moon Knight in Canada because filming in New York is expensive and because it is implausible that there would be so many Marvel characters in New York and not the rest of the world.

As for Luke Cage and Iron Fist, they can team up as Heroes for Hire but then they could have a Daughters of the Dragon story line with Colleen Wing, Misty Knight, Trish Walker and Elektra.  I could imagine that the four of them could become friends after the Defenders and they would sometimes be out late at night and some gangbangers think they are all hot and attack them and the gangbangers all end up in the hospital.",2016-05-29 03:20:57+00:00,d3nnwfe,1.0,t3_4lgedh,40058.0,Defenders

If he had still been alive in 2010 when the new series began then I'm sure they would have brought him back as Steve McGarrett's father.  It is canon on the show that Steve McGarrett's father was a police officer in Honolulu and they have even brought back characters from the old show including Ed Asnser who played August March on the show in 1975 and again in 2012.,2016-05-29 01:21:41+00:00,d3nk22g,1.0,t3_4lfozb,44954.0,FlashTV
913,"If they added new Marvel Netflix series then we should be prepared for the new series to have less quality.  From what I understand, most Netflix originals are not that good.  Then again, if the new shows stick to thirteen episodes a season with a new season every two years then they should be able to come up with decent series.  Network TV has to come up with 23 episodes a year and that's a lot.  That assumes that each show has its own showrunner.  Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist and Punisher each have their own showrunners but the Defenders will have the same showrunners as Daredevil. 

Anyway, Blade and Ghost Rider could be released around Halloween each year.  The first series of each could be an origin story which is easier to do.  All of the Marvel Netflix series have featured origins so far.  That's why they won't bring back Wesley Snipes or Nicholas Cage.  

Well, actually they could.  Wesley Snipes can hunt down and spare the young Blade when he realizes the young Blade is like he was.  ""I used to be like you,"" he'll say, ""and I used to hunt down my own kind.  And I had friends who helped me.  One day we were facing this big bad motherfucker so we developed a biological weapon that would kill him.  It worked but at the cost of my own immortality.  In the years since I have been aging normally.  You, however, will remain young and strong.  You can be the new weapon against the vampires now that they have come back.""

Similarly, Nicholas Cage could cameo in the Ghost Rider Netflix series.  ""You are the Rider,"" he'll say.  ""Each generation has a rider.  The power of the rider doesn't last as the body ages.  Best I can do is go for one last ride with you but you will have to face him yourself.""  Basically, he would take the Kris Kristopherson role from the movie.

The hard one to do would be Moon Knight.  It would be cool if they actually set Moon Knight in Montreal and actually made Marc Spector French Canadian.  He had been a mercenary and made a lot of money as a mercenary and Steven Grant is a pseudonym that he uses to legitimize himself.  But he gets bored with his life.  He is a master of disguise and he dresses up as a cab driver who can barely speak English to hide his identity.

945,"Because space is a near vacuum, a particle of matter in space will travel a long distance before it encounters another particle of matter.  The average distance that the particle travels before it encounters another particle is called the mean free path.  Obviously the wave length is much longer than the mean free path.  Sound is a compression wave.  The more particles that are in an area the more the particles are going to interact and scatter and you'll have expansion.  The next question is how long a period there is between compression and expansion.  If the wavelength is one AU (the distance between the Earth and the sun) and the period is a month then it comes to 10 to 100 km/s.  

I found this too.

1) The JSA formed in 2021.  When Savage exploded the energy that came from his body created metahumans.

2) The JSA formed in during WWII but they were top secret and were never publicly known.  The members of the Justice Society went on to live ordinary lives.  Rip Hunter travels back in time and brings them to the future so they can become legends with some of them being regular cast members and some of them being guest stars.

3) In the moment that the Oculus blew up, Snart gained god like powers and he formed the JSA.  At the end of the season, Snart will give himself a new body and he will be Captain Cold again.

1005,"Yeah, well, I didn't like the last two episodes.

I didn't like the fact that they had to kill innocent people to destroy the Oculus.  

I'm not sure why Rip is bringing Rory along for a second adventure when the first time he just wanted Captain Cold.

I didn't like the fact that they traveled to time periods that they had already visited when Rip said that was impossible.  If they could have traveled back to 1975 again then they would have had another crack at Savage.  They knew where he was in 1975 and figured they had already tried killing him in 1975 and it didn't work.

I didn't like the fact that Sara accepted that she couldn't go back and save Laurel.  Hell, they should have killed Damien Darhk in 1975.  They could have gone back to 2016 and dropped Damien's idol into the sun.  Sara could have gone back and warned John about Andy.  At least they should have saved Havenbrook.

I didn't like the fact that Savage kept Kendra and Carter alive.

I don't understand how 1958, 1975 and 2021 are ""simultaneous"".

I don't understand how Savage can die in 1958 and still be alive in 1975 and 2021.  I don't understand how Savage can die in 1975 and still be alive in 2021.  In theory, if they killed him in 1958 then he would disappear in 1975, 2021 and 2166 and Rip's family would be saved.  I thought that was the whole point.

I thought it was cheap the way Rip was going to sacrifice himself and then just dropped the meteor into the sun.  Also, if the Waverider went to the sun in less than six minutes then it went faster than the speed of light.  Well, actually, it's not so bad because we were observing from Rip's point of view and if he went 97% of the speed of light then he would measure the distance to the sun as a quarter of the actual distance and be there in a minute and a half. http://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1224059993  I wish Gideon would have said ""Captain Hunter, the meteor still hasn't exploded.""  Rip totally believed that he didn't have enough time but by going fast enough he may have bought himself time.

And, yeah, I am going to miss Kendra. 

On the other hand, that was one Hell of a cliffhanger.  ",2016-05-21 03:29:01+00:00,d3drs73,1.0,t3_4k8hm8,46770.0,LegendsOfTomorrow

1062,"That was confusing.

First of all, Arrow has been renewed for Season 5.  Deal with it.  According to the show runners they are going to do an adaption of the Outsiders War.  http://screenrant.com/arrow-tv-show-outsiders-war-comic-coming/  Presumably we will also get flashbacks to Oliver's time in Russia.  

Most likely Ruve will be impeached as mayor and Quentin Lance will run for mayor.  This makes sense: Moira Queen helped Malcolm Merlin in Season 1 and was arrested and went on trial but then later in the same season she was running for mayor!  I expect Quentin Lance will similarly run for mayor.  Either that or Oliver Queen becomes Mayor by default and he reinstates Quentin Lance as a police Captain.  But Oliver Queen as mayor sounds boring.  How can he be mayor by day and fight criminals at night?  No, let them have a new election and have Quentin Lance run unopposed with Oliver's endorsement.

On the Flash, I would have Wally and Jesse stay on the Flash for now.  Neither of them are showing any speed force powers.  Maybe it takes a while for speed force powers to manifest.  So we won't see them using any speed force powers until the mid season finale.

One character they could introduce in Season 3 could be Bart Allen.  With Barry and Iris getting together, it would make sense for Bart Allen to show up from the future in Central City.  Barry has to stop Bart from robbing stores and banks.  Turns out Bart came back from a future where he had been a thief and they developed ways to stop him so he went back in time.  Barry has to convince him to not only stop robbing people but to go back to the future and face justice.  

They could also bring back Reverse Flash although, logically, that would mean going back in time and rescuing Eddie so that Eobard Thawne still exists in the future.

Legends of Tomorrow is going to introduce a new character this week, either Alan Scott or Adam Strange and he is going to enlist the Legends of ""Justice Society"" Tomorrow to prevent the Thanagarians from taking over Earth in the year 2175.  Will this mean that Rip Hunter will still be around?  Some are saying that Rip Hunter will be killed off.  Some are saying that they will manage to kill a younger version of Savage and save not only Rip's family but also Snart.  In any case, the Legends of ""Justice Society"" Tomorrow could be

Hawkgirl

Hawkman

Sara

Atom

Alan Scott / Adam Strange

Jax

Stein

Lady Blackhawk

Starman

They could also introduce Starfire on Legends of Tomorrow because we know that aliens exist.

Now, let's assume that Season 5 is the last season of Arrow.  Maybe Oliver Queen joins the Legends in Season 3.  Then the Arrow time slot is available.  They could do a Titans show with

Wally West

Jesse Quick

Conner Hawke

Speedy

Black Canary

Until DC movies start making a profit, there is a good chance the Shazam movie will be scrapped.  Captain Marvel could similarly be a flop for Marvel.  It is safer to make movies starring established characters.  We might have movies focusing on Black Widow and/or Scarlet Witch in Phase 4.  It has nothing to do with them being female.  To be fair, Perlmutter didn't want Captain Marvel or Black Widow movies because they were female characters and we know because he said so in e-mails to Sony.

1150,"No, Legends of Tomorrow is all about Kendra and Carter.  Kendra has had the most development this season as she has gone from being ""just a barista"" to a warrior who remembers past lives going back to ancient Eqypt.  Carter isn't even the same person he was at the beginning of the season.  He literally couldn't remember his past lives last episode and yet when we met him at the beginning pf the season he had a ""rapey"" vibe.  From Kendra's point of view, he was just as creepy as Vandal Savage.  Both of them claimed that Kendra was their lover in a previous life.  The only difference was that Kendra could remember having had feelings for Carter.

Moving forward, Kendra and Carter still have a story to tell.  I mean, just because Vandal Savage will have been defeated in 2166 doesn't mean that he's not still out there.  (I hope I don't have to explain that.)  They could even encounter Vandal Savage again, although I think most viewers would find that confusing.  The point is they still have more story to tell.

For example, in Spider-Man 2, J Jonah Jameson says that Doctor Octopus can't be called Doctor Strange because the name was ""taken"".  This is not a crossover with the MCU: it's an Easter egg.  Likewise, when the name Stephen Strange was name dropped in Winter Soldier it was just an Easter egg because the Doctor Strange movie hadn't even been announced at that point.

Eobard Thawne was born in the year 2151.  Clearly he was less than 15 years old when he went back in time and killed Barry's mother. ;)

I think in Season 2 Sara et al will do something to change the future so that Rip and the Time Masters never existed.  However the timeline does not set right away.  They will need to carefully make changes to the timeline to ensure that time travel exists in the future and the Time Masters exist in the future before the Waverider itself disappears.  Then a new timeline will establish itself preferably without billions of people being killed by Savage.  

You may be onto something.  We never actually saw Eddie die.  He went through some sort of time vortex.  They could rescue Eddie, revive him using the medical equipment on the wave rider and then Reverse Flash still exists in the future.  Reverse Flash could return in Flash Season 3.

Trying to kill Savage in the past never made sense given the rules as described on the show.  Thing is, if Kendra returns to her life in 2016 then Savage is still alive (presumably - or is he still ash and will be revived later?).  Kendra and Carter would not be safe.  So by all means let Kendra and Carter stay on the ship.

In retrospect, Lucas could totally have expanded Return of the Jedi into four films.

Episode Four (1983) Escape from Tatooine: Luke, Leia and Lando plan and execute a plan to free Han from Jabba the Hutt.  However, soon after they arrive they realize it is a trap.  Vader and the imperial forces are waiting for them.  Logically, the trilogy has to end with Luke killing Vader.  As Vader dies, he ominously tells Luke that there is someone even more powerful than him that Luke will have to destroy.

Episode One (1986): The Phantom Menace

Episode Two (1989): The Clone Wars

Episode Three (1992): Fall of the Republic

Episode Four (1995): Revenge of the Sith: Following the events of the original trilogy, Emperor Palpatine is pissed.  Han is recaptured and killed.  Luke finds himself tempted to take his place as the new Lord Vader on exchange for Palpatine promising to leave Leia alone.

Episode Eight (1998): Palpatine trains Luke in the ways of the Dark Side.  Meanwhile, the Empire hunts for Leia, Lando and Chewy.  Luke realizes that his friends are in danger and that Palpatine lied to him about leaving his friends alone.  Luke fights the Emperor.  The Emperor tells Luke that Vader was his creation, that he used the force to get Vader's mother pregnant.  Luke manages to escape and be rescued by Leia.  Leia and Lando are now unsure of Luke's loyalties.  Why didn't the Emperor kill him?  Has Luke been turned to the dark side?

Episode Nine (2001): A new Death Star is wrecking havoc.  Leia and Lando ask Luke what he knows about the new death star and he says that the Emperor did not trust him with that information.  Luke comes up with a plan: Leia and Lando will be brought to the Emperor as his prisoners.  Luke will tell the Emperor that he has decided to join him and that he offers his friends as a show of good faith.  The Emperor hands Luke a light saber and says that he must strike them down to prove his loyalty to him.  Luke turns on the Emperor and the Emperor laughs, saying that he foresaw his treachery.  The big surprise twist comes when Leia picks up a light saber and brother and sister lay a beat down on the Emperor and kill him.  Luke has secretly been training Leia during the past few years and the combined force powers of Luke and Leia defeat the Emperor.

Recall that when Star Wars came out it was just called ""Star Wars"" and not ""Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope"".  Then when Empire Strikes Back came out it was called ""Star Wars Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back"".  Lucas explained in interviews that he had seven more movies planned including three prequels.  Mad Magazine ran with it and had synopses of Episodes six through nine with Han Solo being Luke's brother and Yoda being Vader's father, etc.  Nobody had any idea that Leia was Luke's sister although, in retrospect, it explained how Leia at the end of Empire was force sensitive.  The question is whether or not Lucas planned to make Leia Luke's sister when he wrote his original script for Star Wars.  Probably not.  Everybody's head canon at the time was that Luke and Leia had done the deed between Star Wars and Empire.  ",2016-05-05 01:06:57+00:00,d2t8eyb,4.0,t1_d2smmdi,29514.0,movies

I thought the list was fairly conservative until they got to Comet the Superhorse.  Even Krypto is a bit silly.  I mean, I guess it makes sense to try to preserve its species but then shouldn't there also be a Krypta the Superbitch and then later Krapto, Krepta, Kropto and Krupta, the Superpuppies?  

It reminds me of what Honest Trailers said of Man of Steel.  Couldn't he have tried terraforming Mars instead?  And technically wasn't it kryptaforming and not terraforming?  Isn't Earth already Earthlike?

H'El sounds a lot like Zod.  Not very original.  

It is hard to predict who is in the pod because there are so many legal issues.  Can it be a version of Super-Man from Earth 3?  That's another possibility: Superman became evil on another Earth and humanity didn't know how to kill him so they put him in his pod and sent him to another universe.  Oh, that's got to be the best idea yet.  Doesn't mean it is what they are going to do.  In theory they could do it and directky address the issue that he doesn't look like their Superman.

Miss Martian is a White Martian.  It would be interesting to ask if any of the White Martians opposed the slaughter of the Green Martians.  Logically, any White Martians that sided with the Green Martians would have been killed along with them.  Presumably Miss Martian's family would also have been killed then.

Most people agree that for time travel to make sense you need alternative timelines because otherwise what happens to the original people, places and things that never existed when the timeline is changed?  If they never existed then you wouldn't even remember them.  It is a problem with the very premise of the show because if the Legends succeed then Vandal Savage never rises to power and nobody will remember anything and they won't be legends, they'd be at best myths because the history they prevented never happened.  And if the events described in the show never happened then what prevented Vandal Savage's rise to power?  It is circular.

1422,It's not a fair comparison.  Daredevil Season 1 needs to be compared to Marvel Phase 1.  Daredevil Season 2 needs to be compared to Marvel Phase 2.  The production values of Daredevil are more similar to movies than TV.  The director of Punisher War Journal did an interview with Kevin Smith.  He asked her if she would want to do network TV.  She said she would like to do a Marvel show for Netflix.  She said that things like the hallway fight (in Season 1) or the stairway fight (in Season 2) could never be done for network TV because fights like that would take all day to shoot and the networks want the entire episode shot in and the can so they can start working on the next episode.  That's the reality of network TV: episodes are shot one at a time and then aired.  Daredevil is shot like a 13 hour movie and with shoots lasting 6 months that gives them two weeks to work on each episode.,2016-04-22 15:37:13+00:00,d2d5qei,1.0,t3_4fxxan,17296.0,Daredevil

You agree that BvS was slow and plodding and didn't have a lot of jokes.  Obviously there were scenes that could have been cut.  If you are addressing the ""it was a total clusterfuck"" crowd then their problems go well beyond a lack of understanding of pacing.  What would they have done to make this movie better?  What would they have cut?  What was missing?  Most people do not offer constructive criticism.  A movie to them is either a piece of crap or a masterpiece.

I think the dream sequences should have been cut.  Scenes with Lois and with Perry could have been cut.  Amazingly the only footage of Superman saving people (other than Lois and that one child) was in a montage.  We needed more scenes with people saying ""Superman, thank you!""  Superman's existence seemed every bit as dreary as Batman's.  Batman was all about punishing criminals.  Superman is about saving as many people as he could.  The contrast between Batman and Superman was lost in the editing.

1446,"&gt; if they're not someone who understands the importance of pacing

That's an ad hominem.  Your saying I was bored during BvS because I don't understand pacing.

Compare BvS to Nolan movies and the problem is that in the Nolan movies things happened.  People don't tell jokes in Nolan movies.  They don't offer up quips.  (An exception would be the robot in Interstellar.  It was actually stated in the film that he was programmed to not be serious all the time.)  But in BvS you would go to a scene with Clark and Lois to a scene with Bruce and Alfred to a scene with Clark and Perry White and it is three scenes where people are just talking and nothing is happening on screen.  Yes, they are establishing the motivations for Clark and Bruce but these scenes go on for too long.  For a movie that had a half hour of scenes cut out it still had a lot of dialogue that didn't further the plot.  And then when the action did start we came to a screeching halt with the dream sequence in which Clark saw his father.  In fact, Batman's dream sequence was also inconsequential to the plot of the film.  I felt like they had dropped a trailer to another movie into BvS.  At least Thor's dream sequence in the pool in AoU was shortened for time.  AoS was too jokey but at least it was better paced.  There was always something happening in AoU.  I fact, the biggest complaint for AoU is that the story was moving so fast that people could get confused.  AoU was better but not perfect.  I do understand pacing but slow and plodding is not automatically better.",2016-04-21 01:18:58+00:00,d2b53dj,5.0,t1_d2ag5fo,33478.0,Marvel

Whedon argued with Fiege over the tone of Age of Ultron.  It was, after all, a sequel to Avengers Assemble.  The tone of Avengers Assemble was perfect but Age of Ultron fell flat.  Both Whedon and Fiege compared Age of Ultron to Empire Strikes Back.

http://screenrant.com/joss-whedon-star-wars-empire-strikes-back-ending/

“[Empire Strikes Back] committed the cardinal sin of not actually ending. Which at the time I was appalled by and I still think it was a terrible idea.”

“Well, it’s not an ending. It’s a Come Back Next Week, or in three years. And that upsets me. I go to movies expecting to have a whole experience. If I want a movie that doesn’t end I’ll go to a French movie. That’s a betrayal of trust to me. A movie has to be complete within itself, it can’t just build off the first one or play variations.”

Whedon has a point.  I think it would have hurt the movie if the ending were a set up for Civil War. 

Fiege, on the other hand, saw Phase 2 as darker than Phase 1: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America and Avengers all had a light, jokey tone with Incredible Hulk's Banner being much more serious than the Banner in the Avengers.  But Phase 2 was darker with Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Winter Soldier and Guardians being darker than most of the Phase 1 films.  Like Fiege said ""Okay, is Phase Two our Empire Strikes Back?’ Not really, but tonally things are a little different."" meaning that Phase 2 was supposed to be darker than Phase 1.

Phases 1-3 are like a long narrative that spans 21 movies starting with Iron Man and ending with Infinity War Part 2.  (Inhumans is now reportedly part of Phase 4.)  Whedon wanted each movie to be self-contained but Fiege wanted the audience to be in anticipation for the next movie.

I think Whedon's POV and Fiege's POV both have their own merits.  I do think the quips fell a bit flat this time, but Avengers would have suffered if it had had a darker tone.  

I imagine Whedon apologized to Fiege because Civil War reportedly has a darker tone and it works.  Fiege might also have apologized to Whedon because he doesn't want to alienate talent.

His abilities are not publicly known as of yet.

The Luke Cage and Iron Fist series will introduce, in addition to the title characters, Misty Knight and Colleen Wing.  Danny Rand is wealthy and can afford to provide Jessica Jones with a better office.  Presumably, Danny Rand will convince everybody to work with her out of the new office.  Perhaps Jeri Hogarth will also hire Matt Murdock to do legal work for her firm but that could be problematic.

So far, Matt Murdock's activities as Daredevil have been highly illegal.  In one scene in the first season of Daredevil, Matt dropped some guy off of a roof and into a garbage bin.  Matt uses his superhearing to determine that he would be okay but not without putting the guy in the hospital.  Matt can't continue doing such things if he is working for Jeri Hogarth because if he does and she knows that Matt Murdock is Daredevil, which she presumably would, then Jeri Hogarth and her firm could get into trouble.  As it is, Matt Murdock himself will probably get disbarred when it comes out that Matt Murdock is Daredevil: it was implied that the Kingpin knows that Matt Murdock is Daredevil and unless we have Danny Rand impersonating Daredevil for a while then Matt's identity as Daredevil will be considered public knowledge.  

It's an awkward situation.  Perhaps, ""Defenders"" is the name of the new agency that gets set up by Jessica Jones, Matt Murdock and Luke Cage with funding from Danny Rand and Jeri Hogarth.  They could conceivably offer a wide range of services from private investigations and legal advice to personal protection.  In Luke Cage, Misty Knight is a police officer and it isn't known what her relationship is going to be with the others or if she would even be useful.  (In the comics, she has a bionic hand.  In real life, a prosthetic hand is not unheard of but it doesn't give people super strength.)

In the comics, Luke Cage and Danny Rand are the Heroes for Hire.  On the Netflix series, obviously they are going to be known as two of the Defenders.  On the show, it is going to be suspicious when somebody goes to Matt Murdock for legal advice and Daredevil shows up with Luke Cage offering them personal protection.  Mind you, this has been a problem with the first two seasons of Daredevil: Matt Murdock investigates the Kingpin and Daredevil shows up and brings him in to the police; Daredevil is seen fighting Frank Castle and then Matt Murdock defends him in court.  If people knew that Daredevil was blind then it would have been obvious that Matt Murdock and Daredevil were the same person.

My point is that Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage will be seen working together but Daredevil won't be advertising the team logo on his chest because he won't want to make it obvious that Matt Murdock and Daredevil are the same person.  Daredevil will operate in the shadows and appear suddenly and beat somebody up and disappear and people won't realize that when they hire the Defenders that they are also hiring Daredevil.  People only care about results after all.

1468,"I was just trying to put together a racially diverse, mostly male team.  Let's break it down.

Spider-Man: The actor playing Spider-Man will turn 20 this year so in 20 years he will be one of the if not the most prominent members of the Avengers.

Ms. Marvel: Ms. Marvel may be introduced in Phase 4 but she will no doubt be cast as young because her character is young.

Quasar: Wendell Elvis Vaughn's quantum bands are of Kree origin.  What they could do is have Tony Stark travel to the Kree homeworld and Xandar and have him collect their technology which he would reverse engineer into weapons that could be used here on Earth.  Wendell Elvis Vaughn could be a SHIELD agent that Tony Stark recruits.

Nova: Richard Rider is the teammate of Ms. Marvel in the All-New, All Different Avengers.  He could be introduced as a SHIELD agent that Tony Stark recruits.

Wonder Man: Wonder Man is a generic strong white male but the Avengers will need a handsome Robert Downey Jr. type for when Robert Downey is too old to do these movies.

She Hulk: She Hulk is a generic strong woman except she is green.  I like the idea of her being big and green all the time and played by a big (not fat) woman and then them using CGI in fight scenes because she gets bigger when she gets angry.

White Tiger: There have been five White Tigers in the comics, including Hector Ayala, Kasper Cole, Angela Del Toro and Aya Ayala.  Angela Del Toro was already mentioned on the Netflix series Jessica Jones.  In the comics, Aya Ayala is the sister of Hector Ayala but for the movies she can be his daughter and can take on the mantle of White Tiger from her father.

Patriot: Patriot is basically a black Captain America and the Avengers always need at least one African American character.

Kate Bishop: Kate Bishop takes on the mantle of Hawkeye from Clint Barton.  In the movies she can be a SHIELD agent who is trained by Hawkeye and the Black Widow.

Stature: Stature is Cassie Lang, the daughter of Scott Lang, who takes on the mantle of Giant Man except she is a woman and Giant Woman sounds dumb.

That's it.  There's also Speed and Wiccan who in the comics are the sons of the Vision and the Scarlet Witch but, wow, it was really dumb when they had kids in the comics so I don't think they will do that in the movies. ",2016-04-18 05:22:16+00:00,d277fu0,9.0,t1_d27502p,5136.0,marvelstudios

1483,"Look, the fact is that being anonymous on reddit does not give you the right to be rude to people. I asked you if you would be rude to me the way you were rude to me in this thread if you were a student in one of my classes. Of course you wouldn't be because you know I could just fail you. How dare you presume that you know more about quantum mechanics than someone who has studied it for decades! And you would deserve to fail because you are scientifically illiterate. You think the purpose of an experiment is to ""prove"" a theory correct. It is actually the opposite: we form a hypothesis and we design an experiment to prove the hypothesis wrong.

Everything you wrote was wrong.

http://i.imgur.com/DaaQthG.jpg

I could do tit for tat and actually respond to the ad hominem above. Note that you never offered anything at all to back up your nonsense. You claimed that there was no evidence for the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. That's a very bold claim. But then again, that is the sort of arrogance I have had to deal with from you. ",2016-04-15 15:28:57+00:00,d242s79,22.0,t1_d23u258,16237.0,shield
1484,"&gt; Anyone can link to a PhD thesis and say it's theirs. Care to take a picture of a certificate that you have in your possession?

I am at work right now.

&gt; Plus you said I was wrong when I said they're just giving evidence for quantum mechanics. And now you go back on that claim. And then proceed to call me stupid once more...

It's hard to have a conversation with you when you constantly use strawman arguments and accuse me of saying things I never said.  You said that there was no evidence for the many worlds interpretation.  This is not true.

&gt; Also, I apologise if you felt offended for calling your thing a shitpost. Youve been on reddit long enough to know what shitposting is, and I hope you understand that it's just a term for low effort posts and wasn't a personal insult. You're the one who started insulting me, personally.

Look, just because you are on reddit and people don't know who you are is no excuse for you being rude to people.  Get that through your head.  I never made any personal attacks and yet you laid into me with ""So go back to making shitty memes on paint and stop thinking you're Stephen Hawking, and learn some humility.""  I'm sooo sorry that I know what I am talking about and you don't.

&gt; So once again I apologise if the whole reason you're being aggressive towards me is because you took what I said about the post personally.
&gt; Also, in philosophy (from which mathematics and sciences are derived from) things can be proven wrong if you take certain things as an assumption. 

Again, things can be proven wrong in science but things cannot be proven right.  

&gt; For example, assuming that GR is correct, I can prove you wrong when you say something false within that theory. If you get what I'm saying?

Please stop being so condescending.  I never said a theory couldn't be proven wrong.  That is precisely what we mean when we say theories can be ""falsified"".

&gt; Also you need to be more respectful, because you were the first one to insult me personally.

No, ""So go back to making shitty memes on paint and stop thinking you're Stephen Hawking, and learn some humility."" is an insult.  Asking you why you don't understand when something is explained to you again and again is not being insulting: it is feeling exasperated!  And, yes, you should be embarrassed.

&gt; I took back what I said about your post, maybe you should take back every time you called me stupid.

Maybe you can just admit to being stupid at this point.

&gt; If you've been trying to teach me something (assuming you are a professor) then maybe it works better if you don't start off by calling your students stupid. Surely you would've known that by now.

You aren't a student of mine.  Would you have been any more respectful if you had been?  Why or why not?

&gt; And you could be the Queen for all I care. Stop saying 'you never know who you are talking to'. If somebody starts to insult me I have a right to defend myself, and I don't care who it is because even somebody important can act like an asshole at times.

Oh I see.  So if you feel insulted by me then you feel free to attack me with insults but if I were to respond in kind then you have the ""right to defend"" yourself???

&gt; And you definitely haven't been discussing things sensibly and respectfully. Just look at the conversation?

I cited sources.  Relevant sources.  I have been from the start.  

&gt; Even I won't pretend like I was being respectful, I know I was insulting you because I felt offended by what you started to say to me. I started being unreasonable,

You were never reasonable.  For God's sake, from Barry's point of view, Fitz is wrong.  Fitz says the future can't be changed and Barry knows this is wrong.  Why would you take that personally?  Where were you ever being reasonable?

&gt; but so did you?

The answer to your question is ""No"".  I was always being reasonable.

&gt; How could you possibly deny that and act like that when all you need to do is read what you've said to me before?

I have been going back and reading what was said before.  So should you.

&gt; I mean, if even after that you still don't understand how offensive you've been, then there's no point talking to you. If you can't even apologise for being rude, you could have 10 PhDs and 5 nobel prizes and I still won't respect you. It's just about being a nice person.

Well, then, I guess you aren't a nice person.",2016-04-15 10:40:54+00:00,d23tqw9,20.0,t1_d23t7w0,1879.0,shield
1485,"&gt; Your stupidity is hilarious, I find myself returning again and again to see if I can achieve anything with somebody like you.

Yes, again and again and nothing sinks in.  Do you have a lack of reading comprehension?

&gt; Are you saying quantum entanglement and quantum erasure are not classified as parts of quantum mechanics? Are you saying you don't understand experimentation?

Lack of reading comprehension confirmed.  Quantum entanglement and quantum erasure are parts of quantum mechanics and, in particular, they are evidence of the many worlds interpretation.  When a scientist opens a box to find if Schrodinger's cat is alive or not the scientist would become entangled with the system he is observing and thus you would get one world where the cat is alive and one world where the cat is dead.  The delayed choice experiment shows that if quantum data is erased then the observer is no longer entangled with the system he is observing.

&gt; And I like my privacy, so I may not want to give a troll on the Internet my A Level certificates and my degree certificate. But as you asked me for that first, and claimed that you had a PhD first, maybe you should not be a hypocrite and give proof of your PhD first as a gesture of good will?

My PhD thesis.
https://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Applications_of_Perturbative_QCD_and_QED.html?id=b6A-XwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y

I am no hypocrite.  Rather, I thought the fact that I clearly knew what I was talking about and you clearly did not would have been enough.

&gt; I started this conversation respectfully, 

No, you did not.  You called my post a ""shit post"".  Why do you think that sort of language was called for?  Also, you went on about ""scientific proof"".  I let it go once because I figured you misspoke but when you said it over and over I had to point out the difference between ""proof"" and ""evidence"".  God knows somebody should have.

&gt; but you started to be so hostile and now you've reached a peak. 

It is not too late for you to apologize for being a complete asshole.

&gt; And it's funny how you keep rambling on about 'you can't prove someone wrong in Physics' yet 

There is a difference between proving something wrong (using experiment) and proving something right.  We never prove anything right in physics.  I have explained this.  There is no excuse at this point for your inability to understand this.

&gt; your shitty low effort post has Barry saying confidently that Fitz is wrong.

Well, Fitz says you can't change the future and Barry knows this is wrong so... yeah.

&gt; As shown by your post and your comments, you have no understanding of how to argue and prove somebody wrong without resorting to ad hominem insults. You belong right on /r/iamverysmart

I said ""You embarrass yourself when you go on about ""proof"" as though ""proof"" means anything in science.""  This is not an insult.  This is a statement of fact.  For God's sake, grow up!

&gt; If you want to discuss science sensibly and respectfully, then please start doing so. Otherwise shut up because I am tired of hearing insults instead of a respectful argument.

I have been discussing things sensibly and respectfully.  You are the one who has been unreasonable.  That's why I said you need to be more respectful because you never know who you might be talking to on the internet.",2016-04-15 09:57:06+00:00,d23t0sg,18.0,t1_d23snvx,1377.0,shield
1486,"&gt; I can't believe I'm having this conversation with someone as stuck up as you.
&gt; The links you gave above are evidence for QUANTUM MECHANICS.

No, the links I provided are for quantum entanglement (""spooky action at a distance"") and quantum erasure (as demonstrated by the delayed choice experiment).  It is not my fault if you don't understand this.

&gt; Many Worlds Interpretation is a fucking INTERPRETATION of quantum theory as to how it could describe reality and what a wavefunction truly is.
&gt; I've looked at the first few links and they all are evidence for quantum entanglement, and quantum theory. I never fucking said quantum theory is wrong. Quantum mechanics != MWI!

No, but there is evidence for the many worlds interpretation over other interpretations.  In particular, if you believe that observation collapses the wavefunction then you have to believe that there is something special about human consciousness.

&gt; Someone with such a fundamental failure to understand the difference between MWI and quantum mechanics cannot be a professor with a PhD. The way you talk and behave online is not indicative of someone who is that educated, and surely your knowledge would surpass the links above, that don't even MENTION MWI.

Oh, wow.  Go complain to your kindergarten teacher if you don't understand.

&gt; Get some real evidence, get a real PhD and get the fuck out. Stop claiming fake credentials when you can't even perform Ctrl+F on your own computer and check if a page has even mentioned MWI. You can't even write 'PhD' correctly, how could you possibly be awarded one?

Okay, at this point I am going to demand proof that you have a high school diploma.  There is just no excuse for your level of stupidity.  The educational system has clearly failed you.

&gt; I mean, you just said you have no clue what I was talking about when I was discussing the scientific method and experimentation and how to gather evidence. You clearly haven't even studied basic science.

Google ""scientific proof"" and you will get links to ""scientific evidence"".  You have no clue what you are talking about and that is just sad.

&gt; Ive had enough of this conversation. Real professors I've met are nowhere as stuck up and wrong as you,

Meeting professors on the street is a lot different than attending actual classes.

&gt; so stop pretending to be one on the internet, stop spending your life in a basement being such an obvious troll and only talk about crap you know about, which I'm guessing isn't that much at all.

The above is just a sample.

&gt; I can point to countless examples of how they have got concrete evidence about GR and spacetime. Gravitational waves ring a bell?

Good for you.

&gt; You are the one who embarrasses yourself by even comparing the two in defence of your crappy post that was made in 5 seconds.

Look, you are one to talk about crap.  Show me the evidence that you even know what you are talking about.

Have you looked in a mirror lately?  Good.  Then you've seen someone completely full of shit and that isn't me.

&gt; And in the Sciences, when stuff is widely accepted and that theory holds to be accurate, that is known as what is 'true' in the world and is proof for it. Evidence. Experimentation. The scientific method.

Now I know you don't have a clue what you are talking about.  There is no such thing as ""scientific proof"".  A scientific theory is one that can be falsified by experiment.  No theory is ""proven"": it is accepted as ""true"" until it has been proven false.

1518,"Greg Berlanti originally wanted to do a Hawkgirl series.  He knew that he had to introduce Hawkman so that he could get his ""But I'm just a Barista!"" moment.  Then he decided that the villain would be Vandal Savage and he made Vandal Savage an Eqyptian rather than a caveman so he could tie their origins together.  He also wanted to make the characters proactive: they didn't want Hawkman and Hawkgirl on the run from Savage all the time.  So they came up wih the idea of Vandal Savage taking over the Earth in the future and Rip Hunter going back in time to stop him.  That's the part that is similar to the Forgotten Heroes but it is also similar to the X-Men stories with Apocalypse having taken over the Earth in the future and Cable having gone back in time to stop him.  The series became more like Forgotten Heroes when they were told they couldn't call the show Justice Society.  They probably did know about the Forgotten Heroes series because they had to research Rip Hunter and Waverider (which also appeared in Justice Society stories).  Given that Geoff Johns and Mark Guggenheim used to write Justice Society / JSA stories for DC, it is easy to spot Justice Society influences on the shows (Jay Garrick, Jesse Quick, Mr Terrific, Atom, Hawkman / Hawkgirl, Vandal Savage, Powergirl).",2016-04-13 06:09:31+00:00,d20uujn,3.0,t1_d20trr1,2800.0,LegendsOfTomorrow

She then takes a closer look and sees that Kara is in her Supergirl costume BUT SHE DOES NOT ASK ANYBODY WHERE KARA IS.  Of course she knows.  Later Maxwell Lord shows up.  And then Non.  Because that is where Kara works.  That's why Non refers to them as her friends.  They all know.

It's great.  It's like the Superman mythos in reverse.  Most people know that Kara is Supergirl.  It's pretty obvious.  And Kara goes through the motions as if she is maintaining her secret identity.

Cat even told Kara that she knew so Kara got Martian Manhunter to pretend to be her.  Cat was confused but she now knows that there are other kryptonians on Earth other than Superman and Supergirl.  And again, she is not surprised at all.  Obviously she knows that Supergirl got another alien to impersonate her.  There was even an episode in which Supergirl fought Bizarro Supergirl and they originally looked identical.  

Cat could come out and point out the fact that soon after Kara appeared with Supergirl, Supergirl herself appeared with another Supergirl so Kara appearing with someone claiming to be Supergirl proves nothing.  But she has decided to play along, obviously, because Kara is apparently too dumb to realize that Cat has it all figured out and, bottom line, she doesn't want Supergirl going nuts again and throwing her out the window.",2016-04-12 19:38:48+00:00,d207p1q,2.0,t1_d1zw5vx,14875.0,supergirlTV

""The Justice Society of America first appeared in All Star Comics #3 (Winter 1940–1941) written by Gardner Fox and edited by Sheldon Mayer during the Golden Age of Comic Books. The team initially included Doctor Fate, Hour-Man (as his name was then spelled), the Spectre, the Sandman, the Atom, the Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawkman.""

""Fan interest resulted in the revival of the JSA in 1991. An eight-issue Justice Society of America limited series featuring a previously untold story set in the 1950s was published in 1991. In the final issues of the four-issue Armageddon: Inferno limited series, the JSA returns to the modern-day DC Universe when Waverider transported the ""daemen"" of the interdimensional Abraxis to Asgard as a substitute for the JSA in the Ragnarök cycle, allowing the team to return to Earth.""

""The Justice Society was revived as a monthly series called JSA in 1999 which mixed the few remaining original members with younger counterparts. This incarnation of the team focused on the theme of generational legacy and of carrying on the heroic example established by their predecessors. The series was launched by James Robinson and David S. Goyer. Goyer later co-wrote the series with Geoff Johns, who continued to write the series solo after Goyer's departure.""

""In September 2005, JSA's popularity led to a spinoff series, JSA: Classified, which tells stories of the team at various points in its existence, as well as spotlighting specific members in solo stories. The first arc featured Power Girl's origin. It was written by Geoff Johns, with art by Amanda Conner. The series was cancelled with issue #39 (August 2008).""

""On December 6, 2006, a new series was launched with the creative team of Geoff Johns (writer), Dale Eaglesham (pencils), and Alex Ross (cover art).""

""Following the Brightest Day story arc, Marc Guggenheim became the new writer with issue #44, and Scott Kolins took over art duties from Merino.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandal_Savage

""Vandal Savage is a fictional supervillain published by DC Comics. He first appeared in Green Lantern vol. 1 #10 (December 1943), and was created by Alfred Bester and Martin Nodell.""

""In the pre-""Crisis"" universe, Savage was native to Earth-Two, but as seen in Action Comics #516, thousands of years in the past a sorcerer revealed to him both the future existence of the Justice Society (even showing him a battle he would have with them, with Hourman in their ranks), and the existence of Earth-One.""

Legends of Tomorrow is based on comics and characters from the 40s, namely the Justice Society and Vandal Savage.  The Justice Society has, over the years, consisted of Atom, Hawkman, Hawkgirl and Black Canary, amongst others.  Modern JSA comics have been written by Geoff Johns and Mark Guggenheim, two of the people who are now in charge of the CW / CBS DC shows (along with Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kriesberg).  Justice Society was the working title of Legends of Tomorrow to begin with: they couldn't use that title because it was felt that Justice Society sounded too similar to Justice League and that people would expect Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman to show up.",2016-04-12 19:15:12+00:00,d206lak,1.0,t3_4efx2v,23308.0,LegendsOfTomorrow

STICK ENTERS COLLEEN WING'S DOJO

STICK: You called?

COLLEEN: We had an incident.

COLLEEN BRINGS STICK TO ANOTHER ROOM 
WHERE SHANG CHI STANDS OVER A NINJA

COLLEEN: Shang Chi fought him to a stand still. 
Then I ran my sword through him.

STICK: Good for you.

SHANG CHI: But look.

SHANG CHI UNCOVERS THE DEAD NINJA'S CHEST

COLLEEN: The ninja had already died and been autopsied!

STICK: He is a member of the Hand.

JUST THEN STEEL SERPENT APPEARS.  STEEL SERPENT
FIGHTS STICK, COLLEEN AND SHANG CHI.  HE LAYS A HAND
ON THE DEAD NINJA WHO THEN SPRINGS TO LIFE.  THEY
BOTH LEAVE.

COLLEEN: What is going on?

SHANG CHI: How many of these ninjas are there?

STICK: Many.

COLLEEN: We need help.

SHANG CHI: Who can help us?

DEFENDERS LOGO APPEARS ON SCREEN

COLLEEN CALLS MISTY KNIGHT

COLLEEN: Misty, I need you to contact Mrs. Big,

MISTY: Luke isn't talking to me.  We had a falling out.

COLLEEN: No, I'll bring in Luke,  I want you to contact MRS. Big.

MISTY: Oh,

STICK APPEARS AT FOGWELL'S GYM WHERE MATT IS WORKING OUT

STICK: I need your help.

MATT: Not interested.

STICK: The Hand can raise the dead now.

MATT: We figured they could do that after Nobu came back.

STICK: I went to Elektra's grave,  Her body isn't there.

MATT: Oh shit.

STICK: Exactly.

MATT: What do you suggest I do?

MISTY APPEARS AT JESSICA'S AGENCY

MISTY: Miss Jones?

JESSICA: Yeah?

MISTY: You're needed right away.

JESSICA: I've already got some cases I'm working on.

MISTY: This involves Luke Cage.

JESSICA: Luke?

MATT, STICK, COLLEEN, MISTY, LUKE, JESSICA AND SHANG CHI
GATHER AT COLLEEN WING'S DOJO

MATT: So who was this ninja who showed up and took the first ninja?

ENTER DANNY RAND / IRON FIST

DANNY: His name is Steel Serpent.

MATT: Who are you?

DANNY: I am Danny Rand also known as Iron Fist.
Steel Serpent works for Madame Gao.

MATT: Madame Gao?

DANNY: You know her?

MATT: A few years ago, Madame Gao and Nobu were working together.

STICK: With Nobu dead, Madame Gao must have taken over the Hand.

DANNY: So we have a common enemy.

MATT: It seems so.

DANNY: Then we should work together.

MATT: Agreed.

THEY SHAKE HANDS

MISTY: That's great!

COLLEEN: Wait!  Where are Luke and Jessica?

The question becomes how Matt was able to get out of the building with Elektra's body if there were hundreds of ninjas waiting for them in the building and outside.  They could easily have killed Matt and taken Elektra's body from him rather than waiting for her to be buried and digging her up.  But, of course, they still would have had to deal with Stick and the Punisher and each of them would have just mowed through them, not the least bit worried about killing them.

I mean, think for a moment, he's the last son of Krypton and he's the only one on Earth with his powers. For that matter, he wouldn't necessarily want other Kryptons on Earth. In the comics and the movies, unless they are a direct relative, other Kryptonians who follow him to Earth tend to be evil. Even Superman clones come out evil most of the time.

Clark Kent is selfish. He doesn't want to be Superman all the time. He wants to pretend to be human. He could be flying around 24/7 saving people but he doesn't. He chose the job of news reporter so he could prioritze and decide who lives and who dies. He didn't just want to be an American hero so he flies around the world to the people who desperately need help and, yes, that could mean ignoring a mugging victim in Metropolis.

The Superman of Superman Returns was basically the same if not worse. He buggered of for seven years. When he returned he showed Lois what it was like to be him, always hearing the screams of people crying out for help. And he's immortal so it will never end. It is like his own personal Hell.

It's not like he can fly to Bangkok, bang a hooker and expect her to survive. Superman has all the responsibility of power but none of the benefits. That actually kind of sucks. What kind of person could he become if he didn't have Lois? A lot of people already worshiped him like a god.

1593,"I recently watched Arrow Season 2 Episodes 21-23 and I thought it was good but the episodes leading up to it with Roy going crazy and Moira Queen getting killed weren't so good.  I think Guggenheim sees that a character has to die every season (first Tommy, then Moira, then Sara, then Laurel) in order for there to be drama.  They've done the same thing on Agents of SHIELD by killing off Victoria Hand in Season 1,  Antoine Triplett in Season 2 and  Rosalind Price in Season 3 and they are hinting that there will be another death by the end of the season.  Actually, Agents of SHIELD has followed a similar arc to Arrow in that the last three episodes of Agents of SHIELD Season 2 were much better than the episodes leading up to that point.  There is the danger that Marvel's Most Wanted will be better than Agents of SHIELD and that they will introduce desperate measures like a Coulson / May ship in order to bring back viewers.",2016-04-10 05:36:20+00:00,d1x0g70,1.0,t3_4e4ibw,5429.0,arrow

1772,"One thing they could do is put the Punisher back in prison at the end of Season 3 of Daredevil.  Punisher Season 1 begins with the Punisher  in prison surrounded by people who want to kill him, including corrupt guards.  You could also have a prison psychiatrist who has studied his case and wants to find out more about him.  What could make it interesting would be to have the prison psychiatrist be a woman and have her be attracted to him.  She conducts a plan that will help him get out of prison.  Now they are both fugitives.  She convinces him that her needs her because couples are less conspicuous when they travel but he soon decides that he needs to get away from her and get back to Hell's Kitchen to continue his crusade against criminals.  Meanwhile, the police catch up with the woman who helped him.  They ask her to help them find him.  She refuses.  She is taken away to prison herself.

One thing that the Punisher series would have to address is the contradiction of the Punisher punishing criminals by murdering them when murder itself is a crime.  Arguably in Daredevil Season 2 the Punisher is only killing people who were responsible for what happened to his family.  Thing is, Grotto was a low level guy and was in no way responsible for what happened to his family.  The Punisher wanted to kill him because he had investigated everybody in the Irish mob and knew what they all did and decided that he deserved to die.  He has no right to do that.  So then the question becomes, if the Punisher intends to punish criminals and he, himself, is a criminal then what is his punishment?

1780,"I think that the logic from Marvel's point of view is that the Netflix shows are equivalent to movies in terms of production values and promotion.  When a Netflix series drops it is treated as an event.  I think Marvel would like to do three seasons a year but Netflix is in charge of scheduling and they seem to want Marvel to release two new seasons a year, one in the spring and one in the fall.  

We probably won't get a Punisher series any time soon.  Production is scheduled to begin on Iron Fist in April and after that we might see production begin on Jessica Jones Season 2 and The Defenders.  Daredevil Season 3 hasn't been officially green lit yet but another season with Daredevil, Elektra, Kingpin and the Punisher seems like a no-brainer.  

What makes Netflix different from regular TV is the amount of time they go from concept to realization.  Sometimes TV executives get an idea for a show in March and somebody has to put together a pilot by June and then they only have a few episodes in the can when the series premieres in the fall.  If the show flops then it doesn't get picked up for a full season and that is all they do.  For Netflix, there are no pilots and all thirteen episodes drop at once.  It is a big commitment.  

You could argue that Daredevil Season 2 was a backdoor pilot to a Punisher series but I'm not seeing it: a Punisher series would need its own supporting cast.  Maybe Daredevil Season 3 will lead directly into a Punisher series.",2016-04-01 00:28:14+00:00,d1l6cbq,,t1_d1kv55r,,Daredevil

1825,"Daredevil Season 2 is clearly setting up Daredevil Season 3.  The Punisher, the Kingpin, Elektra and the Hand will all come back.  The Kingpin will presumably go after Matt Murdock whom he hates almost as much as Daredevil.  He may even suspect him to be Daredevil.  Hence the Born Again storyline.  With Matt Murdock / Daredevil out of the picture, the Punisher will go after the Kingpin.  Daredevil will pick himself back up and defeat Elektra and the Hand and then save the Kingpin from the Punisher.  A lot of viewers are going to think that Daredevil should just let the Punisher kill the Kingpin but you are going to want to allow for the possibility of the Kingpin returning in Season 4.  

Jessica Jones Season 2 will probably involve the IGH storyline.  It will probably also have Patsy Walker going out as Hellcat.  This will probably come out after the Defenders so we could have cameos from Daredevil, Iron Fist and Luke Cage.  Things will heat up between her and Luke Cage again and the season could end with her finding out she is pregnant, her telling Patsy, Patsy telling Luke and then you have a cliffhanger with her having to decide if she wants to keep the baby and have her and Luke become serious.

There's a rumor that Marvel is under contract to do the Defenders as soon as they do Iron Fist which means that we could be getting both Iron Fist and the Defenders in 2017 and Jessica Jones Season 2 and Daredevil Season 3 in 2018.  We will see.  Jessica Jones has been green lit already and Daredevil Season 3 may be green lit soon and the Defenders could be pushed back to late 2018.  Meanwhile, there are rumors that they could be doing Blade and Ghost Rider on Netflix soon.

Agents of SHIELD is... okay.  Rumor has it that the Mockingbird spinoff was the plan all along and they didn't expect to have Bobbi and Hunter on SHIELD for two whole seasons.  The Mockingbird series is reportedly introducing Dominic Fortune.  There are rumors that Marvel wants to introduce Ms. Marvel, Cloak and Dagger, Spider-Woman and Captain Britain on TV.

Flash and Arrow are both okay.  Both shows deal in fake drama with characters angsting over whether or not they will tell their current girl friend the truth about his identity or his son.  I'm not sure why Arrow gets all the criticism.  It's probably because Zoom is a cool villain so viewers cut Flash more slack.  Legends of Tomorrow has been renewed so they are either not going to defeat Vandal Savage this season or introduce a new big bad like the Time Trapper.

There's a rumor that the CW wants to spin Vixen off into another show.  If Vandal Savage is defeated on Legends of Tomorrow then they could have a show with Vixen, Hawkgirl, Hawkman, Wally West, Jesse Quick and Conner Hawke.  I'm not sure how they could bring back Conner Hawke seeing as how he is from Star City 2024 but if they can find a way to do it they will bring him to the present day.

Supergirl varies from really bad to really good.  The last episode was... okay... but there have been enough twists and turns lately that we really don't know what is going to happen next and that keeps things interesting.

1881,"• me

The only thing you have to fear right now.

EDIT: That and cultists.

• life

Better than death.

• being lost

Metaphorically or literally?

• hair loss

We all lose hair as we older.

• weight gain

Maybe you spend too much time in front of the computer.  Physical activity releases endorphins which help your mood.  Yeah, really.  Just because I'm a horny pervert doesn't mean I don't know what I'm talking about.

• aging

Better than death.

• God

No such thing.

• Hell

No such thing.

• people

That sounds like paranoia.  Has anybody prescribed medicine you can take?

• my father

Feel free to explain.

• psychosis

Is that was this is?

• pregnancy

I hear you.

• STDs

I hear you.

• general anxiety
• paranoia

I called it.

• being unintelligent
• being ugly

Are you afraid of getting tiresome?

• being depressed forever/never getting better

You're feeding on your own depression.  You're lashing out at anybody who cares about you because presumably it is our fault that you are still depressed.  You need to take responsibility for your own feelings.

• abandonment

Never.  No matter how much you try to force us to.

• cold climates

I apologize for asking you to get naked in cold weather.  By all means, resume the naked photography when you feel comfortable.

• dental diseases

Illness is part of life as we get older and living is better than death.  Maybe you don't believe me but know that there's no coming back from death.

• rejection

Never.  You don't understand how I feel.  We're talking serious my wife would be upset if she knew how I felt right now.  I feel about you the way I do about celebrities like Rihanna.  I don't know them but I feel as though I do.

• falling susceptible to addiction

Feel free to explain.

• the Pan's Labyrinth monster

Then don't watch the movie.

• surfing/the ocean/big waves/being swept out to sea in a riptide

So... you're in California.

• demonic/paranormal stuff/bad juju

No such thing.

• the risk of serious injury, paralysis, brain damage, or being in a vegetative state from suicide attempts

Then don't attempt suicide.

Seriously I experience the same fear.  We all do.  Like when we look down from a height we are all afraid we are going to jump.  That's normal.  You are the complete opposite of alone in that sense.

• losing a loved one

My mom died two weeks ago.  Life goes on.  Right now I am worried about losing you.  There.  I said it.

• vomiting

Make sure your pizza is properly cooked before you eat it.

• loose hair follicle strands, especially my own (seeing it, touching it, etc.)

Are you afraid of repeating yourself?

• babies

Does that include kittens?

• jail

Then don't commit any crimes.

• checking my bank account balance at any given time

Sometimes I fear checking my messages because I think someone is going to say something abusive and hurtful.

• crazies

See fear #1.

• crazies with guns

Then don't buy a gun.

• racists with guns

Then don't give a racist a gun.

• racists without guns

We just can win with you, can we?  Seriously, do these racists have knives?  How are they going to hurt you?

Actually, the fact that you are afraid of being killed is probably a good sign.  It means that you really want to live.

• crazy racists with guns

And crazy racists without guns presumably.

• extremists

What kind of extremists exactly?  Extreme sports enthusiasts?

• creepy cult people/secret societies

Oh.  Yeah.  They're scary.

• Mulholland Dr

The movie?  Or the actual street?

• Mulholland Dr

You already said that.

• Requiem for a Dream

It's only a movie.

• bugs or creatures that are skiddish/unpredictable/move quickly

Cockroaches?

• authority (DMV, IRS, the Feds, 5-0, etc).

Ah.  So you're in Hawaii.  I thought 5-0 was just a TV show.

• deadlines

You have an actual job?

• the thought of being stabbed

Again, some fears are actually healthy.  It would be a lot worse if you didn't fear knives.

• hypochondria/health anxiety

Pfft.  Again, it would be a lot worse if you didn't care about your health.

• balloons - blowing up, popping, squeaky noises, inflating, deflating, I hate it all

Okay, now you're just making me laugh.

Seriously though, some people are afraid of clowns.

• condescending adults who are older than me and have an automatic built-in bias against me because of my age and lack of life experience

Me?  Don't be afraid of me.  I don't want to stick you with anything.  Well, not a knife anyway.

• placing my trust in the sanitary health conditions of restaurants

See ""vomiting"" above.

• beautiful females, and having to stand in their shadow

Huh?  They stand in your shadow.  They may be beautiful but you are gorgeous.  I know you don't care what I think.  That's how you know I am telling the truth.  I'm saying it even though I know you won't believe it.

• specific recurring nightmares I have, most notably the one in which my teeth fall out

And yet amazingly when you wake up you still have all your teeth.  We all have these dreams.

• the possibility of my teeth falling out (Thanks, Subconsh)

Sometimes it is a relief.  Toothaches are agony.

• inadequacy

I love you.  Please don't make me cry.

• a mediocre life

is better than death.

• singing in public

I wish my wife had that fear.

• the possibility / probability that life is meaningless

Rumor has it that the suits at Netflix were impressed by Jon Bernthal's performance and that they do want a Season 3 but that Marvel is under contract to do Iron Fist next so we might have to wait.  Meanwhile, on TV, the CW might do a Titans show on Friday nights: TNT had the rights to do a Teen Titans TV show but they passed but people at the CW are reportedly trying to do a Titans show with characters like Vixen and Conner Hawke and possibly Wally West, Jesse Quick, Hawkman and Hawkgirl.

1939,"Don't mean to come across as unfeeling or uncaring but sleep paralysis is normal.  If we didn't experience sleep paralysis then our nightmares would cause us to jump out of bed and we would get hurt.  Sometimes I can sense my body entering sleep paralysis before I go to sleep.   I welcome it because I need the sleep.  Sometimes our body goes to sleep before our mind does and sometimes our mind wakes up and our body is still sleeping.  

Do you ever feel your body waking up and you start stretching uncontrolably?  This is also normal.  Your muscles atrophy while you are sleeping and you need a good stretch to get moving again.  Most people go from being completely asleep to being completely awake if they have to get up at a certain time and go to school or work.  You are less likely to remember your dreams if you are distracted this way.  

I understand you've been having bad dreams but most people who remember their dreams find that it makes it easier to deal with bad dreams.  The more likely you are to remember your dreams while you are awake, the more likely you are to recognize when you are dreaming while you are asleep.  That makes it easier to dismiss the dream as just a dream.  Dreams only have power over you if you let them have power over you.",2016-03-18 15:29:39+00:00,d14lda5,3.0,t1_d134eoq,101047.0,DreamFuck

1969,"The problem is that when Marvel first put the Avengers together it was a bunch of white males: Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor Odinson and Clint Barton. Natasha Romanov (Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson) provided all the diversity in the original group. Josh Whedon wanted more women in the Avengers movie so he added Maria Hill. Luckily they hired Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury so that there would be a token black male in the movie: in the comics, Nick Fury had been white and they explain Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury as the son of the original Nick Fury who fought in WWII.

Now that we are in Phase 3, the Avengers are more diverse: new recruits include Sam Wilson (the Falcon), Jim Rhodes (War Machine), T'Challa (the Black Panther), Wanda Maximov (the Scarlet Witch), Peter Parker (Spider-Man), Bucky Barnes (the Winter Soldier), Scott Lang (Ant Man) and the Vision. By the time Infinity War comes along we will also have Hope Van Dyne (Wasp), Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) and Dr. Stephen Strange. Assuming nobody gets killed off in Captain America: Civil War, we will have seventeen Avengers and there will be 9 white men, 3 black men, 4 white women and a robot in the Avengers. No Asian Avengers. No Latino Avengers. Therefore, arguably, no ""ethnic"" Avengers.

Why is this a problem? Well, if you're a white male or a black male or a white woman there is no problem: Black Panther and Captain Marvel are getting their own movies and so far all the solo movies have starred white males. Even Guardians of the Galaxy had a white male lead. Yes, Zoe Saldana is a black Latina but the character she plays is a green alien so I'm not sure if that counts as diversity because if it does then the actors playing Vision, Rocket, Groot and Drax are all white males. You have to go by what you see on screen.

Besides Nick Fury and Maria Hill we have other background characters like Pepper Potts, Happy Hogan, Darcy Lewis, Jane Foster, Sif, Odin, Heimdall, Prof. Erik Selvig, Volstagg, Hogan, Fandral, Agent 13, Laura Barton, Wong and Dr. Helen Cho. They didn't have to make Heimdall black or Hogan Asian but technically Hogan is not Asian but rather he just looks Asian because he is actually an alien. Also, it's a small part.

Agents of SHIELD is a bit more diverse. Ironically Chloe was hired as an Asian American character as it turned out that Skye's mother was Chinese. (In real life it is her father who is Chinese which means her mother must be white.) We also have another Asian American character on the show, namely Melinda May played by Ming Na Wen. The rest of the original cast was all white and most of the current cast is white: we have Phil Coulson, Daisy Johnson (Skye), Melinda May, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Bobbi Morse, Lance Hunter, Lincoln Campbell, Mack, Alisha, Joey Gutierrez, Yoyo Rodriguez, Glenn Talbot and Carl Creel plus the villains (Hive, Malick, Giyera and Lucio). That's 12 men and 6 women with two Asian women, two Latino men, a Latino woman and an Asian man. That's a but more diverse although we do have the problem that the villains right now are more ethnically diverse than the heroes.

We don't know the full line up for the Defenders. We have Matt Murdock (Daredevil), Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Danny Rand, Elektra Natchios, Stick, Patsy Walker, Misty Knight and probably Colleen Wing and possibly Shang Chi. Frank Castle is technically the villain in Daredevil Season 2 but if we include him we have seven men and four women with the actress playing Elektra being Asian European while the character is actually Greek plus two black characters, an Asian male character and an Asian American female character.

We really need Shang Chi in there for diversity. He'd be the only Asian male hero in the Avengers, the Guardians, the Secret Warriors or the Defenders. That's pretty bad, really. What's even worse is that Stick is a blind white guy who has his own Japanese ninja clan. Seriously, it would have made perfect sense to make him Japanese but whatever. Iron Fist being white isn't a problem for me because he is white in the comics. If they made him Asian for the TV show then he would technically be a different character just as Nick Fury in the movies is not the same Nick Fury that fought in WWII.

The Defenders supporting cast is mostly white as well with Foggy Nelson, Karen Page, Claire Temple, Malcolm Ducasse, Jeri Hogarth, Will Simpson and Ben Urich although they did make Ben black but Ben died so he won't be around any more.

By the time Infinity War comes along we will also have Hope Van Dyne (Wasp), Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) and Dr. Stephen Strange. Assuming nobody gets killed off in Captain America: Civil War, we will have seventeen Avengers and there will be 9 white men, 3 black men, 4 white women and a robot in the Avengers. No Asian Avengers. No Latino Avengers. Therefore, arguably, no ""ethnic"" Avengers.

Why is this a problem? Well, if you're a white male or a black male or a white woman there is no problem: Black Panther and Captain Marvel are getting their own movies and so far all the solo movies have starred white males. Even Guardians of the Galaxy had a white male lead. Yes, Zoe Saldana is a black Latina but the character she plays is a green alien so I'm not sure if that counts as diversity because if it does then the actors playing Vision, Rocket, Groot and Drax are all white males. You have to go by what you see on screen.

Besides Nick Fury and Maria Hill we have other background characters like Pepper Potts, Happy Hogan, Darcy Lewis, Jane Foster, Sif, Odin, Heimdall, Prof. Erik Selvig, Volstagg, Hogan, Fandral, Agent 13, Laura Barton, Wong and Dr. Helen Cho. They didn't have to make Heimdall black or Hogan Asian but technically Hogan is not Asian but rather he just looks Asian because he is actually an alien. Also, it's a small part.

Agents of SHIELD is a bit more diverse. Ironically Chloe was hired as an Asian American character as it turned out that Skye's mother was Chinese. (In real life it is her father who is Chinese which means her mother must be white.) We also have another Asian American character on the show, namely Melinda May played by Ming Na Wen. The rest of the original cast was all white and most of the current cast is white: we have Phil Coulson, Daisy Johnson (Skye), Melinda May, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Bobbi Morse, Lance Hunter, Lincoln Campbell, Mack, Alisha, Joey Gutierrez, Yoyo Rodriguez, Glenn Talbot and Carl Creel plus the villains (SquidWard, Malick, Giyera and Lucio). That's 12 men and 6 women with two Asian women, two Latino men, a Latino woman and an Asian man. That's a but more diverse although we do have the problem that the villains right now are more ethnically diverse than the heroes.

We don't know the full line up for the Defenders. We have Matt Murdock (Daredevil), Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Danny Rand, Elektra Natchios, Stick, Patsy Walker, Misty Knight and probably Colleen Wing and possibly Shang Chi. Frank Castle is technically the villain in Daredevil Season 2 but if we include him we have seven men and four women with the actress playing Elektra being Asian European while the character is actually Greek plus two black characters, an Asian male character and an Asian American female character.

We really need Shang Chi in there for diversity. He'd be the only Asian male hero in the Avengers, the Guardians, the Secret Warriors or the Defenders. That's pretty bad, really. What's even worse is that Stick is a blind white guy who has his own Japanese ninja clan. Seriously, it would have made perfect sense to make him Japanese but whatever. Iron Fist being white isn't a problem for me because he is white in the comics. If they made him Asian for the TV show then he would technically be a different character just as Nick Fury in the movies is not the same Nick Fury that fought in WWII.

The Defenders supporting cast is mostly white as well with Foggy Nelson, Karen Page, Claire Temple, Malcolm Ducasse, Jeri Hogarth, Will Simpson and Ben Urich although they did make Ben black but Ben died so he won't be around any more.

The problem, of course, is that the characters from the source material are mostly white males and the female characters are mostly white love interests and not heroes in their own right.",2016-03-17 03:43:54+00:00,d12vkgb,1.0,t3_4akb2s,112296.0,marvelstudios

The problem is that when Marvel first put the Avengers together it was a bunch of white males: Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor Odinson and Clint Barton.  Natasha Romanov (Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson) provided all the diversity in the original group.  Josh Whedon wanted more women in the Avengers movie so he added Maria Hill.  Luckily they hired Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury so that there would be a token black male in the movie: in the comics, Nick Fury had been white and they explain Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury as the son of the original Nick Fury who fought in WWII.

""When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near.
Luke 21:20

In the story, Jesus Christ was ""predicting"" the fall of the Jewish rebellion.  Jesus represented capitulation to the Romans.

He said to them, ""Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.""
Luke 20:25

""Put your sword back in its place,"" Jesus said to him, ""for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.
Matthew 26:52

But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.  Matthew 5:39

If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.  Luke 6:29

The Jewish people believed that their messiah would rescue them from Roman rule whereas Jesus seemed to be promising the reverse.

Now consider when the gospels were written.

""Although some scholars disagree, the vast majority of researchers believe that Mark was the first Gospel to be written, sometime around the year 70. This scholarly consensus holds that the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke were composed, independently of one another, sometime in the 80s or 90s.""

http://www.bc.edu/schools/stm/crossroads/resources/birthofjesus/intro/the_dating_of_thegospels.html

The gospels were written in Greek around the time of the events they were said to have been predicting and were attributed to people who were Jewish fishermen.

Now for me interracial films live or die by the performance and thankfully she does a pretty decent job here. While not quite as great as Kurea Hasumi's she still seems to enjoy herself throughout and is really seductive. And Yuki Jin looks amazing as well. The films title describes her ass as godly and that's a pretty fair description lol.

2051,"I'm sorry to say that I don't have all the Yuki Jin videos that Panking uploaded before.  The reason why is because I was able to find a whole bunch of Yuki Jin DVDs in Taiwan and even though they were censored I couldn't resist buying them and watching her wiggle her ass in front of the camera.  I suppose I could upload the DVDs here but they would be 4G each and playback would be an issue.  If I uploaded everything from a DVD though you could burn the files to a blank DVD and play it anywhere.  Plus you would get Chinese subtitles.  Everything in Taiwan has Chinese subtitles.

This particular video I must have downloaded as a torrent.

This video runs 2 hours and 19 minutes and she has sex three times.  It starts with an interview mostly in a car that lasts 24 minutes.  The first sex scene then starts and lasts 54 minutes after which there is a brief scene of her in a car again, now at night, and  then it is day time again.  She has sex two more times but each time she is wearing the same outfit.  After another 56 minutes, when the sex is over we can see light coming through the window but then they cut to a shot of the sun going down in the distance which suggests that the video took two full days to shoot.

To me, the best part of the movie is at the 1 hour 35 minutes point.  Yuki had just had sex with some guy in a public bathroom and now she has gone with him to what looks like an apartment and is standing in front of the window and wiggling her butt.  I could (and have a couple of times) watch an entire video of her wiggling her butt.  The first time I ever saw her actually have sex it was like the greatest thing in the world.  Now it's old hat for me, personally, except when she is getting fucked doggy style and then it's excellent.

The CW has enough characters already (Jesse Quick, Wally West, Conner Hawke, Hawkgirl, Hawkman and Vixen) that they could do a Titans show.  In fact, it would be a lot less risky to do a show with existing characters then to go to the trouble of casting all new actors.  Legends could contine with Rip Hunter, Captain Cold, Firestorm, White Canary and Atom.  I don't think Heatwave is going to be on the show after last week.

2057,"I know you're joking.

Historically people dealt with death by imagining that people didn't really die, that it was only their bodies that died while their ""souls"" went on to another place.  This comforted people because they were able to kid themselves into believing that their loved ones were still with them.  They were also able to control their fear of death because they believed that their solus would have ""eternal life"" after their bodies died.  Suddenly killing people didn't seem so bad because you were only killing their bodies.

Now we face the possibility of time travel and alternative realities.  What if you could go back in time and meet your mom when she was still alive.  Does that make her death any less meaningful to you?  What if there was an alternative timeline where your mother was still alive.  Does that comfort you?  The idea that we could have many worlds all equally real and that your mom was both alive and dead may in the future be spoken at funerals instead of the usual superstitious nonsense.  After all, how could people be comforted by myths they didn't seriously believe in anymore?

Thing is, it all comes down to the same thing.  You can't build a time machine and see your mom again and you can't visit her on another Earth.  Oh yeah and you probably should have fed your cat cans of tuna rather than just giving him bags of dry food.  Death still has consequence and it is no more moral to let people die than it was before we realized all we do now.

2072,"When Vixen appeared on Arrow the head of the CW said ""She will either get her own show or appear on Legends of Tomorrow"".  And when Conner Hawke appeared on Legends of Tomorrow, the actor playing Conner Hawke said ""They want to bring me back.""  That might be difficult because supposedly the last two episodes of Legends of Tomorrow have already been written even if they haven't been filmed.  Presumably that means there will be a second season of LoT and they will visit a different Star City 2046.  If so we will see future Ollie again too.

It does sound like we will be getting a second season of Legends.  They can't do a Justice League TV series because there is the Justice League movie coming out and the lawyers for the CW say they can't use the name Justice Society for a TV show either so the only other show they could do would be Titans.  We have Captain Cold, Hawkgirl, Hawkman (currently dead), Rip Hunter, Firestorm, Atom and White Canary on Legends of Tomorrow and Jesse Quick and Wally West might become speedsters on the Flash and then we have Vixen, Constantine and Conner Hawke.  Then there's the Titans characters Dick Grayson, Donna Troy, Changeling, Starfire and Raven that they could get permission to use.  They already have an actor who can guest star as Roy Harper.  Then there's the question of whether or not the CW could be allowed to use a Green Lantern.  Presumably Hal Jordan, John Stewart and Guy Gardner would be in the movies.  Could they have Kyle Rayner on TV?  How about Doctor Fate or Zatanna?  They already have an actress who played Doctor Light on the Flash.  So there are 13-14 characters they could spread over two shows and 7-8 more characters they could add.  (Starfire might work better on Supergirl.)

It really comes down to ratings.  They could just continue Vampire Diaries indefinitely.  I mean, the most obvious time slot for a new DC TV CW show would be Friday at 8:00.  A live action Titans show might be able to attract people familiar with the cartoons.  And there was going to be a Titans show on TNT before they passed on it.  All we know is that there is talk about substituting characters on LoT and/or creating a new show.

When did the two Earths become different?  Given the wide differences in terms of fashion, I would say that if the two Earths were the same about forty years ago then the slight differences have magnified in the years since.

A lesbian film starring two actresses with the best asses in JAV? Sounds like heaven to me. There may be a plot here but to be honest I'm not sure what it is. Now as per usual with lesbian JAV the sex here is not that amazing. Expect a lot of kissing, eating each other out, vibrator play, groping and licking. But their performances are incredible. They seem to have good chemistry and are really passionate with each other. Also both of them look amazing here. Seeing these two together nearly left me speechless. They just look sooo good.

My priority was downloading videos, which turned out to be the right move because when Panking's account got wiped it was all pretty much moot for me because I had downloaded the videos I had wanted.  That's me being selfish, I know.

I first learned of this video through when somebody posted the following gifs.

http://gfycat.com/CharmingPoliticalBluefintuna
http://gfycat.com/PlumpDampFulmar

At first I thought the gifs were taken from AUKG-277 but somebody pointed out to me that AUKG-277 was a lesbian video while these scenes were MFF.  It wasn't until I ran my mouse over the gif that I found that the gifs were taken from REAL-575.  I wanted to watch the video but I didn't have it.  How could this be?  Surely Panking had already uploaded this and I had downloaded it.

It turns out that the video came out in January.  I haven't seen much output from Yuki Jin lately so maybe this was made a while ago and only came out recently.  Could it be that Yuki Jin is still making videos?  Why don't we see more output from her then?  

I haven't watched it all the way through but it looks like it is the best video ever.  I can't imagine how long it would take for me to watch this: I would probably watch a bit of this, immediately cum, fall asleep, wake up, watch a bit more, immediately cum, repeat.  There are other Kurea Hasumi videos that I have never gotten all the way through because I eventually have to go to work.

Having Kurea Hasumi and Yuki Jin in the same video is a dream come true.  Having them getting fucked in the same scenes is mind blowing.  I have watched softcore Yuki Jin videos and been thoroughly entertained.  The first time I saw her having sex on camera I could hardly believe it.  Seeing Kurea having sex is nothing new but seeing her with Yuki Jin is a real treat.  Yes, she has done MFF scenes before but I usually just focus on Kurea and ignore the other girl.  In this case, I honesty wouldn't know who to fuck first.

I'm going to shut up now because I really really need to get back to watching this.

2113,"The next season of Peggy Carter should have Stark and Wilkes recreate the formula that created Captain America but the new super soldier they create turns out to be insane. It should take place ten years after the first two seasons so that Peggy and Sousa are already married and have a child. That would make Sharon Carter her granddaughter. Ick. Anyway, Edwin and Ana Jarvis will look after young Rose Carter while her mom and dad work at the SSR. We also need to be introduced to the woman who will eventually become Tony Stark's mother: presumably Howard and Maria meet in the 50s, get married and have Tony in the 60s.
Season 4 should jump ahead even more so that young Rose Sousa is now grown up herself and working for SHIELD with a young Hank Pym, Janet Van Dyne, Nick Fury, Alexander Pierce and Mitchell Carson. They don't know that Alexander Pierce and Mitchell Carson are working for Hydra with Dr. Arnim Zola. The season should focus on Hank Pym developing his formula and becoming Ant Man and Janet becoming the Wasp. It should also have Stark building the first SHIELD helicarrier. It is set during the cold war so the villains need to be Russians. Perhaps Dottie Underwood can return. She is the one now running the Black Widow program and one of her agents tries to infiltrate SHIELD and hijinks ensue when she is discovered. Meanwhile, there's a young SHIELD agent with an eye on Rose Sousa.
Season 5 has Tony Stark as a teenager, Hank and Janet active as Ant Man and the Wasp and the rest of our heroes investigating the mystery of the Winter Soldier. When Janet ends up missing in action, Hank quits SHIELD. Alexander Pierce and Mitchell Carson think Howard is getting close to learning the truth about Hydra working under their noses so they have him killed. Rose Sousa learns she is pregnant and tells her boyfriend and he says he asks her to marry him. She says yes but he too gets killed. Months later she names the child Sharon Carter Sousa.
Season 6 would tell the story of how a young Bruce Banner became the Hulk and how SHIELD tried to contain the threat. It can have a young Nick Fury arguing with a young Thunderbolt Ross as to how to best deal with the situation. Meanwhile a young Sharon Carter starts working for SHIELD and interacts with a young Maria Hill, a young Phil Coulson and a young Clint Barton.

2229,"Hellcat is Trish Walker.  She first appeared in Miss America Magazine #2.  During the 40s, 50s and 60s she was Patsy Walker, Marvel's answer to Archie.  This was satirized on Jessica Jones with Patsy Walker being the name she used when she was a child star.  On Jessica Jones, she is Jessica's best friend.  They grew up together.  She doesn't have powers but she didn't have powers in the comics either and yet she hung out with the Avengers and the Defenders.  In both the comics and on Jessica Jones she is a skilled fighter and wants to be a super hero.

Misty Knight was a love interest for Iron Fist in the comics.  She is a cop who helps him.  In the comics she lost her arm but then Tony Stark gave her a new prosthetic arm that was better than her original and enables her to punch holes in walls.  She will appear in Luke Cage but she is probably just going to be a cop.

Elektra in the comics was an old girlfriend of Matt Murdock.  They broke up when her father died.  Then she became an assassin with the ninja clan known as the Hand.  On the Netflix shows it appears that she is working with Stick to fight a Yakuza clan known as the Hand.  It isn't clear how she got to be where she is today, if she was working with the Hand before or if she has always been working with Stick.

Colleen Wing is an American with a white father and a Japanese mother.  She grew up in Japan.  A buddhist monk from K'un L'un told her about Iron Fist and she went back to New York where she was born to fight by his side.  When Iron Fist became friends with Luke Cage, she became friends with Misty Knight.

Stick is a blind man with radar sense like Matt who was trained by the warrior clan called the Chaste.  He trained Matt when he was a child and tried to recruit Matt into the Chaste but Matt refused (in the comics and on the show).  He has three noted comrades in the comics, namely Stone, Shaft and Claw.  Stone appeared briefly in Daredevil Season 1.

Shang Chi is basically a rip off of the 70s TV series Kung Fu except he is set in present day.  In the comics he is the son of Fu Manchu, who also served as the series' main villain.  Some people are saying that Shang Chi could be a supporting character on Iron Fist, say for example as an old friend from K'un L'un.  This has not been confirmed.

I know it is a pain but you need to type K'un L'un with the apostrophes because Kun Lun is an actual place in China.",2016-02-27 01:22:33+00:00,d0fbeag,6.0,t1_d0ewj1w,22733.0,marvelstudios

2253,"The problem is that a country can claim water off its coast as far away as 200 nautical miles as an ""exclusive economic zone"".  The question is whether 3-16 fisherman living on an island constitutes a territorial claim.  I would say that the Republic of China has a claim to Itu Aba Island, also known as Taiping Island, and therefore an area up to 200 nautical miles could be claimed as an EEZ, except of course in areas that would actually belong to other countries.  Basically it would come down to which country is closer.  I am not sure where West York Island is but I imagine it would fall in the EEZ of Taiping Island so its a moot point.  I need to find a better map to see how this would pan out for all parties involved.

The biggest problem is that the Republic of China's claim isn't even being considered by the UN: it is the People's Republic of China's claim that is being considered.  Taiping Island is currently under the control of Taipei.  Even if the UN were to acknowledge the Republic of China's claim, would not the People's Republic of China have to back off or is the UN going to ignore the fact that Taipei and Beijing are controlled by different governments and are not part of the same sovereign nation?

EDIT: Okay, so looking at a map, I can see that the Paracel Islands are close to China's Hainan Island and the Scarborough Shoal is closer to the Philippines than to China.  Taiping Island is dead set in the middle of the Spratly Islands.  If you draw an arc around Taiping Island between Taiping Island and Malaysia, the Republic of the Philippines, the People's Republic of China and Vietnam then you get an irregular shape that contains the Spratly Islands.  The EEZ of Taiping is effectively the Spratly Island chain.  Therefore the Spratly Island chain belongs to the Republic of China.  Basically, instead of an ""Ox tongue line"" we should have a sock with the toe located both midway between Vietnam and Malaysia and midway between Natuna Besar and Taiping Island and the heel following the mid line between Taiping Island and the West Coast of the Philippines up to the point equidistant from Taiping Island, Hainan Island and Luzon.  You can also trace a line between Hainan and Vietnam and extend it down to the toe and also draw a line between Taiping Island and Malaysia / Brunei from the toe to the heel.  If all the claimants could agree to a sock-like line around the Spratlys then China would have to give the Scarborough Shoal back to the Philippines in exchange for having the issue settled.",2016-02-22 04:57:26+00:00,d08yla1,4.0,t1_cy1y7c7,5786182.0,worldnews

2258,"I've been thinking about where the next X-Men movie should go.  I figure with Xavier having seen the future in X-Men: Days of Future Past he is going to recruit Wolverine and go after Stryker and rescue his son, Jason.  Presumably X-Men: Apocalypse did not occur in the original time line.  I'm not sure where Apocalypse was in the original time line.  Presumably he was captured and killed by the government after Mystique had killed Trask.  Anyway, Stryker is brought to trial and, as the trial is taking place, Sabretooth shows up and kidnaps Jean Grey.  Xavier is able to find Jean Grey and rescue her but there is the question as to why she was kidnapped in the first place.  Mr. Sinister is revealed in the end credits scene.  Actual title could be X-Men: Resurgence but the tongue-in-cheek title would be X-Men: Reboot.

In the sequel, Mr. Sinister could recruit an army of mutants including Sabretooth, Toad, Callisto, Juggernaut, Arclight and Madrox.  After an opening sequence with the X-Men fighting Sinister's group they discover that Sinister had been raising a young girl named Madelyne Pryor whom they realize is actually a clone of Jean Grey.  This suggests that a lot of time has passed since the previous movie.  We learn that Madelyne has all the powers of Jean Grey but none of her moral scrupples and the X-Men end up having to fight her and her ""father"" Mr. Sinister in the final act.  Working title would be X-Men: Dark Phoenix Part 1.

The third movie would then have Jason Stryker return wanting revenge against the X-Men for whatever they did to his father.  He will strike at the X-Men by making them believe that Jean has turned evil and that she has to be stopped.  Jean similarly won't know why the others are turning on her.  I wouldn't do a literal interpretation of the Dark Phoenix Saga because that would require them having to kill off Jean Grey again.  Instead, the movie should end on a happy note with Scott and Jean getting married.

Finally they would have a crossover with X-Force and New Mutants.  Working title would be X-Men: Extinction with Xavier having decided that the X-Men could not put up with Cable and Deadpool's actions.  More than 40 years will have passed in story since X-Men: Apocalypse but the actors who play Scott, Jean and Storm will only have aged ten years.  We will also have gotten an X-Force trilogy and a New Mutants trilogy in the meantime.  Because money.",2016-02-20 03:53:10+00:00,d06pmz7,4.0,t1_d060ir2,39703.0,LegendsOfTomorrow

2295,"The writers, directors, actors and comic book artists get along well but the men in suits hate each other.  For Marvel and DC, it started in the late 30s and early 40s when DC had Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman and Marvel had Captain America, the Human Torch and Submariner.  Marvel would do whatever they could to screw over DC such as introducing a Captain Marvel in order to steel the rights to the name ""Captain Marvel"" from DC and then constantly introducing new characters with the name Captain Marvel so that DC couldn't take the name back.  The spite carried over into the movies.  For example, when Bryan Singer said he wanted to do Superman Returns before X-Men 3, Fox fired him from X-Men 3 and eventually gave the director's chair to Brett Ratner.

2303,"The best three episodes were at the end of Season 2.  Season 3 has been good so far but I feel the mid season finale in which Ward was killed and then immediately came back as a zombie was anti-climactic.  The trend seems to be for each season to slowly build towards a solid finale so we should encourage people to stay with it.

Anyway, I am of the opinion that Captain America: Civil War is a natural continuation of Avengers, Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron and that both Agents of SHIELD and the Netflix shows have already been dealing with the fallout, especially Jessica Jones which had ordinary people suspicious of powered people as a result of what happened in the Avengers.  The fact that people are frightened of Inhumans on Agents of SHIELD also fits in to what they are doing with Civil War.  Even as far back as the first Avengers movie there was the question as to whether or not the Avengers themselves were somehow responsible for what happened in New York and the events of Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron are just going to add to that impression.  The situation won't be settled until Infinity Wars is over.  In the meantime, Agents of SHIELD is already following the Civil War storyline: SHIELD is not officially sanctioned and anything Hydra does just makes things worse for SHIELD because the general public sees Hydra as an off shoot of SHIELD.  As of the very end of Age of Ultron we see signs of the government trying to take the Avengers away from Stark.  Stark is going to have to work with the government because he still believes that the Earth needs a shield of armor and if it can't be Ultron then it will have to be the Avengers.  Stark believes that he needs to be in charge or they will all die.

TL;DR: The movies and Agents of SHIELD have been setting up Civil War since Winter Soldier ",2016-02-16 02:10:15+00:00,d01emvi,1.0,t3_45y1i2,25829.0,shield

2315,"New Teen Titans #1 came out in 1980.  That's almost 36 years ago.  I feel old.

Anyway, Deathstroke first came into conflict with the Teen Titans because his son Grant Wilson the Ravenger had died after trying to kill them.  (He had been hired by H.I.V.E. and died as a result of the physical enhancements that H.I.V.E. gave him.)  My idea is that they could make Grant Wilson the Ravenger the big bad against the Titans instead of Slade Wilson / Deathstroke the Terminator.  

If they introduce Green Lantern into the Arrowverse then that means that aliens exist in the Arrowverse.  It makes sense then that Green Lantern could assemble a team to deal with alien threats and take in refugees from alien conflicts and this could be a way they introduce Starfire.  Meanwhile Changeling could be introduced on the Flash as a metahuman.  It could be explained that his powers did not emerge until he reached puberty and that's why we didn't see him in Season 1.  All the New Teen Titans except Cyborg could eventually appear in the Arrowverse.  Hell, Cyborg could get name dropped as a member of the Justice League.

(If Reverse Flash hadn't interfered with the time line Barry Allen would have joined the Justice League but in this time line he is too busy in Central City dealing with metahumans that appeared as a result of the same particle accelerator explosion that gave him his powers.)",2016-02-14 19:58:50+00:00,czzus0x,1.0,t3_45qfb1,25747.0,LegendsOfTomorrow

He would essentially be their child... which is super creepy.",2016-02-14 18:18:43+00:00,czzr8v8,3.0,t1_czzm4eq,9054.0,LegendsOfTomorrow
2318,"I've been giving a lot of thought to what would happen when the first season of Legends of Tomorrow is over.  Presumably after they defeat Vandal Savage they will still have to deal with the Time Masters.  Presumably they will spend several episodes fixing the time line so that unintended consequences of their actions are reversed so that not only will 2016 look like 2016 but 2166 will look like 2166 but Rip Hunter's wife and son are alive again.  Then there will no longer be a reason for Rip Hunter to be on the show.

Greg Berlanti knows that this is a problem for the show.  He also knows that LoT is a hit and that he has proven that a superhero team could work on network TV.  So who replaces Rip Hunter after Rip Hunter takes the Legends back to 2016?  Personally, I would like to see Hal Jordan Green Lantern take Rip Hunter's place.

Meanwhile, Atom and White Canary could return to Star City.  If they were to do a Titans spin off then they would need Dick Grayson, Donna Troy and Raven.  As an added bonus we could learn that Hal Jordan actually has three Green Lantern rings and that he gives one ring each to his friends, John Stewart and Kyle Rayner.  

In the comics, Wally West dated and eventually married Linda Park.  In order to recreate a team consisting of Nightwing, Wondergirl, Arsenal and Kid Flash for TV, I would have Wally and Linda get serious and then Linda gets a job in Star City and has to relocate.  Ta da.  Now we have a show.

The next question would be what to do with Captain Cold and Heatwave as they are clearly not the hero types.  The best use of Captain Cold would be to have him steal John Stewart's Green Lantern ring and then Hal Jordan et al have to fight Captain Cold to get the ring back.   So, yeah, he would be a villain again.  Having him go back to being a villain makes sense though because Leonard doesn't change his spots.

Anyway, I completely forgot about Zatanna.  Zatanna could be brought in to help train Raven in the use of her powers.  She could just show up and say ""John (Constantine) told me you needed my help.""  

Anyway, that is the best they can do.  They are not going to have Superman, Batman or Wonder Woman show up on any of the Arrowverse shows.  Cheap versions of Cyborg and Aquaman are also unlikely although we could have cameos from Aqualad and Aquagirl.  Fans are also going to want to see Starfire and Changeling.  And fans are definitely going to want to see Deathstroke, Terra, Jericho and Ravenger especially as Deathstroke in the comics was a villain for both the Teen Titans and Atom.

That's probably too many characters.  The solution would be to have characters go back and forth between Legends of Tomorrow and the Flash and Titans and Arrow.  Older characters like Atom, White Canary and Zatanna would provide financial support, tech support and training and would be absent from episodes when they aren't needed.  Hell, Arrow himself could guest star on Titans to give them all extra training.  

Of course, this is all assuming that when the CW cancels Supernatural and/or Vampire Diaries that it doesn't just replace them with ordinary teen dramas.  I am a bit worried about when they would put a Titans show on.  If they took the Supernatural time slot then it would be like two hours of Arrow on Wednesday nights.  If they took over the Vampire Diaries time slot then that would mean premiering a new show on a Friday night and networks don't like to do this because Friday night ratings aren't very good.  What they would probably do is premiere a Titans show on a Wednesday and take advantage of the lead in ratings from Arrow and then move it to a Friday night when they either cancel Vampire Diaries or else move it to Wednesday to take over the Supernatural time slot.  I like the idea of a new Arrowverse show every day at 8:00 from Tuesday to Friday. ",2016-02-14 18:11:22+00:00,czzqz6y,1.0,t3_45qfb1,19299.0,LegendsOfTomorrow

2392,"It has to do with the grandfather paradox.  If you go back in time and kill your grandfather then you will never be born.  In the 1950s, a physicist came up with a solution to this paradox.  He suggested that alternative time lines exist.  If you go back and kill your grandfather then you create an alternative time line in which you don't exist.  If you return to the future then you will return to a future in which you never existed.  The original future still exists and from their point of view you were not able to kill your grandfather which they will interpret as meaning that the past cannot be changed.

This simple idea has influenced a lot of science fiction.  For example, in the Star Trek episode City on the Edge of Forever McCoy travels back in time and causes the Nazis to win WWII which results in a completely different future.  Amazingly Kirk and Spock manage to prevent McCoy from changing history, which is ridiculous when you consider the butterfly effect.

The butterfly effect is an idea from chaos theory.  It states that a butterfly's wings flapping can affect the weather on the other side of the world, perhaps ultimately resulting in a hurricane for example.  If you were to go back in time it would be impossible to interact with the past without changing the future... unless of course you were to create a causal loop.

A causal loop or ""closed time-like curve"" is an idea from physics.  Basically in quantum mechanics it is possible for events to ultimately be their own cause.  Examples of events that are their own cause include nuclear decay, photon decay into electron-positron pairs and vacuum fluctuations.  

Causal loops have also been used in science fiction.  For example, in the first Terminator movie Arnold went back in time and scientists were able to reverse engineer terminators from the arm that was left in the factory.  Basically if you were to go back in time and do one thing that affected the course of history then you could find yourself returning to your future and finding that nothing had changed and that your actions had been part of history all along.

When Bryan Singer was working on Days of Future Past he asked James Cameron about how to reconcile causal loops with the butterfly effect.  James Cameron made an analogy with a river and said that you can divert the water but it is still going find its way to the ocean.  Singer ended up using that analogy in the movie.

In any case, if people were to go back in time to change the past, the people in the future would never notice a difference.  Rip Hunter doesn't care about this: he just wants his wife and son back.  Of course, logically, the farther back in time he goes back and makes changes, the more different the future will become and the more likely it would be that his wife and son never exist.

2398,"I've been thinking about where this series can go after they defeat Vandal Savage.  Presumably Rip Hunter will end up being arrested by the Time Masters for changing the timeline at the end of this season.  That would be the cliffhanger.  How cool would it be if they have to break him out of Time Master prison next season?  The big bad next season could be the Time Trapper.  If they can arrest the Time Trapper then perhaps the Time Masters could forgive  Rip Hunter for his crimes.  Then what?

I think if they want to keep the show going then they need to introduce Green Lantern.  The story would be that Hal Jordan has been missing for years because he has been training on Oa and now he has returned to Earth as Earth's Green Lantern.  He assembles a team consisting of Firestorm, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Atom and White Canary and maybe Vixen and Kid Flash.

2456,"My guess is that the anthology stories will all be mostly set in the time of the original trilogy.  The smart thing for them to do is to do movies like Rogue One with new characters who can spin off into their own movies.  As the characters age we will see glimpses of Luke, Leia and Lando from the viewpoints of the new characters and that will serve to bridge the gap between the original trilogy and Episodes VII, VIII and IX.  They will probably also have movies focusing on Poe Dameron.  I suspect that Poe Dameron will have a small part in Episodes VII, VIII and IX and then we will have movies set before, during and after Episodes VII, VIII and IX filling in the gaps.  We don't know, for example, how Poe Dameron got off of Jakku and made it back to the rebels.  If Rogue One is any indication, we will have a whole movie about that soon enough.  Rei and Finn will be pretty much ignored until Episode X which will feature Finn's daughter having to fight the son of Rei and Poe who has turned to the dark side.

Well, in that case Adam Warlock, Pip the Troll and Phyla-Vell are real possibilities for Guardians 3 with Moondragon, Captain Marvel, the Thing, Jack Flag, Major Victory, Flash Thompson, Kitty Pryde and Bug appearing in the comics and being all but impossible to add.  Oh wait though they added Mantis already so Moondragon is a possibility if they make her an alien.  They could also introduce a character called Quasar and have him be a member of the Nova Corps and have him be the Xandarian equivalent of Iron Man.  

Captain Marvel in the MCU will be Captain Danvers so she is definitely human and the Thing and Kitty belong to Fox.  Sony will probably want to save Flash Thompson for Spider-Man movies and, besides, he is not an alien.  Bug is  owned  by Hasbro, I think.  Jack Flag and Major Victory sound like Captain America rip offs.  They can each be introduced to the Avengers in Phase 4: Marvel needs new characters and actors to keep things fresh.  Richard Rider (Nova) is to the Xandarians as Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) is to the Kree so it would make infinitely more sense to introduce Nova in a Captain Marvel movie, the point being if the Kree can give powers to a human why can't the Xandarians do the same?  Nova, logically, then would join the Avengers and not the Guardians.  

If they introduce Adam Warlock and Adam Warlock wields the Infinity Gauntlet then he could create Magus and they could then introduce the time travelling Maxam as someone who travels back in time to help them fight Magus, although that particular plot line is overused now what with Star Trek 2009, Days of Future Past, Legends of Tomorrow, the entire Terminator series and Looper.",2016-01-24 16:49:36+00:00,cza452b,6.0,t1_cza1kzo,4916.0,marvelstudios

Black Widow, Wasp and the Scarlet Witch are the only females (outside the supporting cast) with Captain Marvel not even cast yet.

An entirely female Avengers line up would probably not make billions at the box office but as actors retire they will probably be replaced by the newer characters from the comics which tend to be female.  It is a problem for Marvel as they go forward.  This is why it was so important that they got to use Spider-Man and why they insisted on casting a young actor: Spider-Man and the actor who plays him will be the focus of future Avengers movies after the current cast has gotten too old and too expensive.

2527,"You are asking the wrong question.  The question should be ""Why are some people naturally monogamous and some people aren't?""  Women tend to be more monogamous because they can only have one or two children (twins) a year so there is no advantage in having multiple partners.  The exception is the case where one partner is a good provider and the other partner is a good lay.  But for a woman to have hundreds of partners makes no sense biologically.  Men will have hundreds of partners because men can produce as many babies a year as they have partners.  Thus men in general are not naturally monogamous.  Some men may be naturally monogamous however: if women are naturally monogamous and they have a gene for monogamy on their X chromosomes then wouldn't all men have a gene for monogamy on their X chromosomes?  Obviously not all of our behavior is determined by our genes.  Perhaps some women are not naturally monogamous either.  

A lot of animal behavior is determined by genes however and we see that some birds are monogamous and some aren't.  The theory is that monogamy and polygamy are competing strategies and that every generation a number of birds are born with an innate tendency towards each strategy in direct proportion to how successful each strategy is.  Could the same be true of humans?  That is the right question.  ",2016-01-17 02:56:17+00:00,cz13tak,1.0,t3_418j47,46276.0,TrueAtheism

2549,"The problem is that in comics they had thought balloons.  Barry could think his way out of a problem.  For TV, you have dialogue instead and Barry needs people to talk to so he can solve problems.  These characters need to then pull their own weight as part of the team otherwise they don't deserve to be on the show.  Thus Cisco gets his own powers.  

I actually like the fact that Barry has a supporting cast.  I like the fact that Barry, Joe, Iris, Wally, Caitlin, Cisco, Wells and Jay all belong on the show, if only because Wally is going to become Kid Flash.  People who haven't read the comics might wonder why they are bothering to bring in another character.

I do feel like Patty Spivot is the ninth wheel here.  She is basically there to be the one person (besides Wally) who doesn't know Barry is the Flash and this is fake drama just like it was fake drama when Iris didn't know.  If Barry is serious about Patty then he should tell her that he is the Flash. 

Of course, what I don't understand is why Barry is interested in Patty Spivot at all.  Last season he was pining over Iris and now that Eddie is dead and Iris is available he is interested in Patty instead.  That doesn't make sense.  I imagine that when he calls it quits with Patty that Iris will have another boyfriend and Barry will pine over her again.

2565,"In theory, these films could be great.

My favorite series of videos has got to be Oriental Orgy World.  I have only seen two of them: Oriental Orgy World 2 and Oriental Orgy World 5.  I tried getting the others but I couldn't find them.  It seems sometimes the videos would get posted as a direct download or on a streaming site and get deleted for violation of copyright.  According to imdb, the first Oriental Orgy World came out in 2005 while Oriental Orgy World 6 came out in 2008.  Maybe I should try again to get the other videos in the series.  Frankly though I imagine most torrents for videos from 2005-2008 are long dead by now.

Anyway, the premise is simple: six or seven black guys fuck six or seven Asian chicks.  That's it.  I remember it took me weeks to get through Oriental Orgy World 5 because I would watch it for a few minutes, cum and then do something else for a while until I felt horny again, watch it for a few minutes more, cum, repeat. 

The last thing that videos like this need is a plot.  We don't need scenes with one or two girls at a time.  They should go straight to the orgy scene and make that the whole video.  Hell, they can use multiple cameras and show the same stuff from different camera angles so we don't miss anything.  It would be too bad if you were a fan of only one of these girls and she spent the whole movie in the background with other couples blocking your view of her.",2016-01-08 08:17:58+00:00,cyqer8m,2.0,t1_cynamra,209210.0,JavDownloadCenter

""'I think ideally there will be a rhythm of about every six months you’ll get a new season or a new series from the Defenders group. And they’ll crossover into a combined season [the Defenders miniseries] once we’ve launched the first season of each of the four characters…Some will selectively have multiple seasons as they come out of the gate.

2598,"Simple misquote.

""Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos offered up a slew of new info regarding the streaming platform’s upcoming slate of original series, and it didn’t take long for the super-shows to get mentioned.  

""'I think ideally there will be a rhythm of about every six months you’ll get a new season or a new series from the Defenders group. And they’ll crossover into a combined season [the Defenders miniseries] once we’ve launched the first season of each of the four characters…Some will selectively have multiple seasons as they come out of the gate. So there will probably be two launches a year.'""

So Daredevil Season 2 in April, 2016, Luke Cage probably around October and then nothing else for 2016.

2603,"As 2015 draws to a close, the possibility that Marvel and Netflix will sign a deal allowing more shows from Marvel to appear on Netflix is becoming less and less.  Rather than get a full thirteen episode series of Punisher maybe we can get a Marvel-Netflix TV movie.  Ditto for Blade (with or without Wesley Snipes), Moon Knight and Ghost Rider (which would be too expensive in terms of CGI for a full thirteen episode run).  After The Defenders comes out we can expect the actors on Daredevil, etc. to show up on the other shows so that Daredevil, etc, will be like one series that drops episodes twice a year except that you get a series of thirteen episodes at a time that focuses on one or two characters (usually) as opposed to everybody.  Moon Knight, Blade, Punisher and Ghost Rider could appear in the other series and also accept cameos themselves.  Or they could save Moon Knight (and Spider-Woman) for ABC Network TV and do a Shang-Chi TV movie instead.  The current show runners for Daredevil, etc. could do the TV movies because otherwise they would only be required to do 13 episodes every two years which kind of sucks: the Daredevil showrunner could do The Punisher, the Luke Cage showrunner could do Blade, the Iron Fist showrunner could do Shang Chi and the Jessica Jones showrunner could do Moon Knight.  Someone with a horror background could do a Ghost Rider TV movie.  Every year we could have two series and two TV movies.

2605,"I think fans need to stop and consider the fact that Marvel doesn't own Netflix and that Netflix is only going to show as many Marvel shows as they can afford.  Marvel shows are expensive to make: there's a lot of stunt work and outdoor locations.  It is much cheaper for Netflix to buy dramas that are shot on sets or indoors.

2015 is ticking down and it doesn't look like we will get a Jessica Jones season 2 in 2016 and given that they have (finally) started working on Iron Fist, there probably won't be a Daredevil season 3 in 2017.  Maybe we can get a Daredevil Season 3 in 2018.

You do realize that we still don't have a showrunner announced for The Defenders?  We are assuming that The Defenders will drop in 2017 but that might be delayed until 2018.  We could have Jessica Season 2 in 2017.  They asked Krystin Ritter if the Jessica Jones Season 2 could drop before or after The Defenders (or not at all) and she said ""I'm not supposed to talk about that"".  This could mean many things.

Right now Netflix is only paying Marvel for two shows a year.  If you want to see something other than Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist or Jessica Jones by the end of 2018 then Netflix needs to sign a new contract with Marvel.  This could happen.  Or not.  You see, whereas Daredevil and Jessica Jones did well, if people sign up for Netflix for a whole year just to see Daredevil are Netflix going to make any more money from more shows?  Remember that Netflix doesn't make a lot of money from ads, if any.  Ratings, ultimately, don't matter on Netflix: all it shows is that a show is popular but that doesn't necessarily mean more money from Netflix.

If you were a Marvel exec, how would you convince Netflix to pay for more shows?  The more expensive the shows are to make the less likely Netflix is going to want to pay for them.  Do we want to watch 13 episodes of Blade and Moon Knight drinking coffee?

EDIT: Netflix is more likely to agree to show TV movies starring Punisher, Blade, Moon Knight, Ghost Rider and Shang Chi rather than full series.  ",2015-12-29 00:47:18+00:00,cyeed9v,1.0,t3_3yj84u,32169.0,Defenders

2621,"&gt; When you said everything started to disappear back to the future style I thought you meant more than just the one guy.

His computer disappeared too.  So did his time ship.  Obviously they were able to prevent the entire universe disappearing.  They did more than ""save the city"".

Also, there was no guarantee that Barry would become the Flash after his mother was killed because everything had changed for him.  Perhaps Eobard Thawne aimed the lightning at Barry somehow.  This was implied in the flashback scene early in the series that showed Wells watching Barry getting struck by lightning.  Some people have suggested that Eobard Thawne lost his powers because Barry wasn't going to become the Flash and thus he wouldn't have become Reverse Flash.  That logic doesn't hold up but it would explain a lot: Eobard Thawne started getting his powers back soon after Barry became the Flash.

2623,"&gt; Future flash went back in time to stop RF from killing young Barry.

If RF had killed young Barry then Barry would not have become the Flash and could not have gone back in time to prevent RF from killing young Barry.

&gt; The plan was never to kill Barry's mother.

He didn't intend to kill Barry's mother but he did go back in time and kill Barry's mother.

&gt; Future flash saved Young Barry and while he was away RF killed Nora Allen. Killing Nora clearly did not affect him becoming the flash since Nora is currently dead and Barry is still the flash.

Actually, yes it did affect Barry becoming the Flash.  Eobard Thawne set the wheels in motion for Barry to become the Flash.  Now perhaps Barry would have become the Flash anyway but Eobard Thawne did not want to wait that long so he killed Harrison Wells and took over the particle accelerator.  Oddly enough Earth 2 Harrison Wells was also able to finish his particle accelerator early but in Earth 2 Jay Garrick become The Flash and Barry didn't (unless you believe that Earth 2 Barry is Zoom).

&gt; Also Eobard was not from a different future (not sure what that even means).

Yes, he was and it's not my problem if you don't understand this.  In Eobard Thawne's future Doctor Wells turned on the particle accelerator years later and Barry became the Flash but Eobard Thawne said he didn't ""want to wait that long"" and planned everything so that Barry would become the Flash (even to the point of putting a camera in the police station so that he could see Barry getting struck by lightning).

&gt; And I don't recall things disappearing back to the future style. 

Did you not watch the season one finale?  Eobard Thawne disappeared when Eddie Thawne died.  This is analogous to Marty McFly disappearing when his parents didn't hook up.

&gt; Things started getting sucked up because the wormhole start labs created became unstable.

Sorry, what?  Everything started getting sucked up because if Eobard Thawne didn't exist then he didn't go back in time and kill Barry's mother in which case the whole time line shouldn't exist.  Barry and Firestorm... somehow... prevented this.

2628,"The first half season is better than they say.  When we first watched it, we were wondering why they weren't fighting Hydra.  Well...

Turns out they were fighting Hydra.  In the second half of the first season Coulson suspects that there are people in SHIELD that are keeping secrets and this leads directly into the reveal that there were people in SHIELD working for Hydra all along.  We also learn how Coulson was able to come back from the dead and at the very end of the season Nick Fury tells Coulson that he is retiring and that Coulson will be Director of SHIELD in his place.  Season one also introduced an incredibly lame version of Deathlok.

The first half of the second season deals with SHIELD versus Hydra but it also deals with Skye learning that her mother and father still being alive and her mother being an Inhuman.

The second half of the second season deals with SHIELD members questioning whether or not Coulson is fit to be director of SHIELD.  There is essentially a coup against Coulson with Gonzales taking over as Director and Coulson becoming a fugitive on the run.  The season ends with the Agents of SHIELD fighting both Hydra on one front and Skye's mother and father on another.

The first half of season three features the Agents of SHIELD fighting... you guessed it... Hydra.  There were a lot of complaints that Agents of SHIELD should have dealt with Hydra early on (when in fact they were and we didn't know) and now the biggest complaint is that SHIELD fighting Hydra is becoming tiresome.  That being said, we have two villains from the comics that were introduced in the first half of season 3, namely Lash and Hive, so from here on in it seems that the series is going to be more about superpowers than spies.

One thing that has been a big surprise on the show is how many characters get killed off.  There was one big surprise death in the second half of seasone one and literally more than a dozen surprise deaths so far in seasons two and three with the net reaction usually being ""He's not really dead, is he?  I mean, he's coming back, right?""   

Still around in the second half of season 3 are Coulson, May, Skye, Fitz, Simmons, Joey, Lincoln, Mac, Bobbie and Hunter.  Most of them have been through Hell, in some cases quite literally.

There is talk of them doing a spin off called Marvel's Most Wanted which would focus on Bobbie and Hunter.  Marvel is making a pilot episode which will either become the first episode of a new series next September or an ordinary episode of Agents of SHIELD focusing on Bobbie and Hunter.  It's up to ABC whether or not we get a double dose of Agents of SHIELD next year.  

We also got eight episodes of Agent Carter this year and we will get ten episodes of Agent Carter next year.  We will probably get another Agent Carter series a year from now.  A Ms. Marvel series is also rumored although Marvel may surprise us with a Cloak and Dagger series instead and save Ms. Marvel until after the Ms. Marvel movie comes out.  Spider Woman is another character that is rumored to be coming to Agents of SHIELD.  Moon Knight would also be a character they could introduce, especially if they do the planned spin off.",2015-12-23 10:27:40+00:00,cy8tgeb,1.0,t3_3xx9kq,22042.0,marvelstudios

2639,"Daredevil Season 2 was announced after Daredevil came out and they've supposedly finished filming and it should be coming out early next year.  Filming began on Luke Cage in September so I imagine if they wanted to start production on Season 2 of Jessica Jones right now then it wouldn't be a problem.  They can't start filming Iron Fist or Defenders yet because Iron Fist has not been cast yet.  So I don't think production is the problem.  I think the problem is that Netflix has only ordered two series a year from Marvel.  These shows are expensive to make because they are filmed on location in New York City.  

Every day that goes by makes a new season of Jessica Jones less likely.  Perhaps instead of a new season of Jessica Jones we will have the Jessica Jones showrunner move on to working on Defenders: the IGH storyline might be picked up in the Defenders.  Perhaps the Defenders will advance the storylines of each of the four regular shows.  If Netflix wants a second season of Jessica Jones or a third season of Daredevil then they will have to pay for it and based on the reception of Daredevil and Jessica Jones so far and given how much they cost to make Netflix might not be able to afford the amount of money that Marvel would want them to pay.",2015-12-21 00:07:15+00:00,cy60rov,3.0,t1_cy5nwmm,20654.0,marvelstudios

2645,"&gt; The Republic stood for 25 thousand years in Expanded Universe material, but if you're real uptight about what is canon and not canon (honestly I think that's irrelevant at this point), canonicly it stood for a thousand years.

&gt; The Jedi were largely a peacekeeping force, though their guidance and wisdom was often called on.

2647,"&gt; He clearly maintained close relationships with his friends, to the end.

My understanding is that he spent most of the 30 years after RotJ by himself. 

&gt; Anakin didn't just fall in love with Amidala, he wanted to possess her and control her. When she opposed him, he killed her.

&gt; Yoda was clearly wrong. 

Yes, Yoda said ""difficult to see is the future"" but he did foresee the possibility of Luke turning to the dark side.  Anakin never had a father figure growing up.  The closest he had to a father was Obi Wan but he treated Obi Wan as an older brother rather than a father.  The Emperor was basically the first person he looked to as a father, perhaps because the Emperor.

&gt; Anakin killed Amidala because she didn't do what he wanted.

Actually, no, his attack on Amidala was not life threatening.  She died because she ""lost the will to live"".  This was stated in the dialogue.

&gt; The crux of my argument is that the Jedi Order lost because they had begun to fear their own emotions. I think if Luke had followed Yoda's advice, he would have been cast adrift without his friends, he would have had nothing to fight for, and his father would have convinced him to join him.

Or perhaps the Jedi Order began to feat their own emotions as a result of experience with people turning to the dark side.  People have made the point that the Jedi were able to maintain the peace in the Republic, presumably for ""a thousand years"", but by Yoda's own admission there have constantly been people going to the darkside.  In fact, he said in TPM ""There is always two, the Master and the Apprentice"" (which is bullshit of course because the first time somebody would have gone to the dark side it wouldn't have been because someone corrupted him).  Even the title of Episode III ""Revenge of the Sith"" suggests that the Jedi had to fight Sith Lords in the past.  Did they really have thousands of years of peace if they were constantly fighting Sith Lords?

&gt; In that moment, Luke was tapping into the dark side, his rage and hate for Vader. When he cut off Vader's hand, he realized that he was becoming his father by allowing himself to give in to rage and hate. That moment had nothing to do with the fact that he had gone back for his friends on cloud city.

Arguably Luke killing Vader and then becoming a Sith Lord could have been what Yoda foresaw.

&gt; Arguably if he had never lost his hand on Cloud City he would not have had that epiphany in the hallways of the Death Star.

I think Lucas was suggesting that when a part of himself was replaced by a machine he was already becoming more like Vader.  Lucas apparently saw amputees as evil. :)",2015-12-20 12:11:43+00:00,cy5f27w,6.0,t1_cy5dn3s,6767.0,atheism

Yes and no.  Luke avoided being corrupted by the dark side by not having any close relationships.  Anakin fell in love with Amidala and that's what turned him to the dark side.  Jedis apparently aren't allowed to love.

&gt; In the prequel trilogy, the Jedi are clearly the backbone of what is holding the galactic republic together.

I didn't really get a sense of that.  How many Jedis were there in total?  I thought there was only a couple of dozen fully trained Jedis.

Was it selfish for Anakin to want to save Amidala?  Was it selfish for Luke to want to save Leia and Han?

2668,"It's actually a lot simpler than that.  Imagine if by definition I said we each had zero energy.  Then I somehow managed to give you an amount of energy E.  If we had no energy before then I would now have an amount of negative energy -E.

It sounds stupid, I know, but that is basically the idea.  Here's an actual example: you can ionize an atom by hitting one of the electrons with a photon.  Fine.  But what about the reverse?  When an electron gets captured by an ion and it becomes a neutral atom the atom emits a photon.  But where did the energy come from to create the photon?  This is known as the binding energy of the atom and it is actually a negative energy: you need to add energy in the form of a photon in order to have a free electron.

The same logic applies to gravity: energy is required to give objects escape velocity; if we define an object that is moving freely in space as having zero potential energy then an object in a gravitational well has negative potential energy.  

Some physicists argue that the universe is a closed system and that energy would be required for objects to escape the universe.  If you define objects free from the universe as having zero energy then perhaps the universe has zero total energy: this would explain where the energy came from to create the universe.",2015-12-18 00:50:16+00:00,cy2vioc,7.0,t1_cy2tsz6,3140.0,askscience

2674,"Now that we know who may be playing Starlord's dad we can talk about who he might be playing.  Based on the evidence, I would say he is playing the Eternal Eros.  Here is the evidence.

1) He belongs to an ""ancient race"" so presumably he is immortal.  Although you would have to ask why he doesn't have children spread around the galaxy whereas the scientists on Xandar said that his genetic code was one they ""hadn't seen for a long time"".  My guess is that Eternals are genetically incompatiable with most races and humans are an exception.

2) Eternals have already been introduced, sort of, because Thanos belongs to the race of Eternals.  (Specifically, Thanos and Eros both were born on Titan which is a moon of Saturn although in the movie Titan would have to be a planet in another system because if there were an ancient race living on Saturn's largest moon then you would think astronomers on Earth would have noticed.)  This Eros would be a cousin of Thanos which would make Starlord a second cousin of Nebula.  Hopefully this doesn't make things weird with Gamora.

3) Quill's mother described his father as ""an angel"".  This is a clue that he will be godlike and indeed it could be the Eternals as a race were worshipped by the Greeks in the same way that the Asgardians were worshipped by the Vikings.  

Anyway, that's my theory.  In any case, the idea that Starlord's dad belongs to an ""ancient race"" that is neither Kree nor Asgardian does open up possibilities for Vol. 3.  The planet Titan could have all the characters from the Eternals comics plus characters from Greek mythology.  They could also introduce Adam Warlock as an Eternal.

2679,"I think they might save Runaways for a movie.  It doesn't have to be a hard R like Jessica Jones and, besides, the characters on Runaways are supposed to be a second generation anyway.   Also the concept needs a little work: if people are experimented on it doesn't follow hat their kids will have powers.   I mean, if you cut off my arm and I have a child the child won't be born armless so similarly if I am granted superpowers then why would my kid have superpowers?  I suppose you could make an argument that if the mother has superpowers then whatever growth hormones are in her body making her strong are also going to make the baby strong.  When a male superhero has a child you can't make the same argument, not unless we're dealing with superpowered sperm.  Indeed, even if a superpowered man were to have sex with a normal woman without hurting her too badly if the child were to have superpowers then it will hurt like Hell when it starts kicking.  So the premise of superpowered children is dicey.  Marvel  can't use mutants in the MCU and you need terrigen mist to activate inhuman powers.  Perhaps they could do a Runaways story on Agents of SHIELD with Hydra exposing young known Inhumans to terrigen mist and the group collectively escaping Hydra captivity.  Or, like I said, they could save that premise for a movie but seeing as how they already have a TV show with Hydra activating Inhuman powers that would seem the way to go.  They could always introduce the concept on Agents of SHIELD and make it into a movie anyway like they are doing with Inhumans already on Agents of SHIELD.

Similarly THunderbolts is a concept that needs a bit of work.  There can't be more than a dozen superpowered Hydra agents out there so you would basically need most of them to break off and form their own group.  You would have to pick characters that could come off as heroes: Angar the Screamer literally screams villain.  Then there's the problem that DC already is doing Suicide Squad while Sony keeps pitching a Sinister Six movie.  Then again, we already have Baron Zemo being introduced in Civil War.  If they wanted to do a Thunderbolts movie right now then they could use the Abomination, Crossbones, Crusher Creel, Graviton, Blizzard and a token female character with superhuman strength like Thundra from the comics.

Personally, I would go with the following storyline: Blade settled down and started a family ten years ago after seemingly wiping out the entire vampire nation.  However, the Hand is using supernatural means to revive vampirism and create a vampire army that they can use as their soldiers.  It makes sense because in the comics the Hand soldiers would dissolve when they were sliced up.  A Blade series could have Abigail Whistler, Misty Knight and Colleen Wing as supporting characters.

A lot depends on the people behind Netflix: the first step would be to greenlight a second season of Jessica Jones and a third season of Daredevil.  That would be a clear indication that Netflix is treating The Defenders as an on going series.  Then we can have a season of Punisher the following year instead of Daredevil and perhaps a season of Moon Knight in 2018 following Iron Fist in 2017.  You would basically need a new series every three months and right now that is the upper limit of what Marvel can provide.  It is just a question of whether or not Netflix is willing to pay for the content because Marvel's Netflix series are supposedly expensive to make (as a result of all the time spent on location).  Agents of SHIELD is much cheaper to make because they mostly film on sets rather than on streets.

In the comics, there are a LOT of powered people.  They could easily find 50 x 6 = 300 Avengers.

In the movies, not so much.  More likely the result of Civil War would be that the Avengers can only operate in the US, Canada and Mexico and they won't be allowed to operate anywhere else.  

The next step would be for individual countries to try to form their own Avengers teams and perhaps having to pool their resources.  In Latin America, you would have O Vengadores / Vingadors (Avengers), in the EU you would have Les Vengeurs (French for Avengers), in Russia you would have the Мстители (Avengers), in Israel you would have the הנוקמים (Avengers), in Africa you would have De Wrekers (Dutch for Avengers), in Arab countries you would have the منتقم (Avengers), in India you would have the एवेंजर्स (Avengers), in China you would have the 復仇者 (Avengers) and in South East Asia and the Pacific you would have the Pembalas (Indonesian for Avengers).  So basically, you would need a lot more than five teams, closer to ten, and something of the order of sixty Avengers around the world.

2700,"The Cloak and Dagger and Hulk rumors date back to 2011.  Cloak and Dagger was originally considered for ABC Family and maybe still is.  Marvel doesn't want to do a Hulk movie and have to share proceeds with Universal so Marvel considered doing a Hulk TV show and then considered having the Hulk appear on Agents of SHIELD and is now talking about a Hulk TV show again but a prequel would be boring because it wouldn't tie into any of the TV shows or movies.  Jessica Jones and Mockingbird were rumored back in 2011 and they did in fact get to be on Netflix and ABC, respectively.  There's also been a lot of talk about an Iron Fist show and that's finally happening.  We will probably get a Punisher show from the same people who do Daredevil so Elektra, Blade, Ghost Rider, Cloak and Dagger, Moon Knight and Hellcat spinoffs may be in the cards on Netflix.  Basically, it all depends what storyline they have planned for The Defenders: if the villain(s) they face are supernatural then Blade, Ghost Rider and Moon Knight would fit in the same continuity.  Oh, and of course, the current contract with Netflix which has Marvel doing only two shows a year is another problem: Marvel is now capable of producing four shows a year for Netflix based on the fact that season 2 of Daredevil is coming out only one year after season 1.

The most interesting rumor foe me is the rumor that Doctor Strange will be in both The Defenders and The Avengers, basically as a Deux-Ex-Machima type who comes in, does his thing and then leaves.  It makes sense that Doctor Strange would be involved in the fight against Thanos but it is unsure how he would work with The Defenders, although people point out that Iron Fist's power is mystical in nature already.",2015-12-09 05:25:00+00:00,cxsint7,2.0,t1_cxs84im,17805.0,Defenders

Then we have to wait until a second season of Jessica Jones has come out.  That means that The Defenders is probably a full two years away.  I suspect that Daredevil / Punisher / Luke Cage / Iron Fist / Heroes for Hire /  Jessica Jones / Defenders was all part of the plan laid out by Joe Quesada, Jeph Loeb, Brian Bendis, etc.

We still don't know what the John Ridley Marvel television project at ABC is.  It is rumored to be Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan).  Another rumor is that Marvel approached him with a Cloak and Dagger pilot script idea and he passed.

Maybe this is an illusion because the small image is lower resolution but it seems as though most of the pixelation is gone in the smaller image and you can actually see more.  Cropping the image and just showing what you see on screen would just mean showing an image in which the best part is covered up using pixelation. ,2015-10-23 08:30:48+00:00,cw9uz0x,2.0,t1_cw90vh3,55729.0,KureaHasumi

2790,"There is archaelogical evidence to support the idea that Jewish people were enslaved by the Hyksos in Egypt. There is also archaelogical evidance that supports the idea that Jewish people were in Egypt before the Hyksos arrived. The word ""Hyksos"" comes from Egyptian and means ""foreign rulers"". We don't know much about the Hyksos except that they invaded Egypt and drove the Egyptian rulers south to what is now Sudan. Amose was the son of an Egyptian pharaoh who was able to successfully retake Egypt from the Hyksos. This coincided with a volcanic eruption on the island of Crete (which destroyed the Minoan civilization there). There has been plenty of speculation that the volcanic eruption may have caused the Nile River to turn red and frogs and locusts to swarm. In particular there was a documentary produced by James Cameron on the subject. But there's no evidence that Moses himself existed and in fact there is evidence that he didn't: the name ""Amose"" means ""brother of Mose"" in Hebrew but it means no such thing in Egyptian and, in fact, Amose did not have a brother. Whenever you talk about the Exodus you need to keep in mind that while Jewish people may have lived in Egypt in the past and been slaves under the Hyksos and may have been driven out along with the Hyksos by Amose, the fact is that the story of Moses is fictional and any elements referring to Moses himself were made up.

Ad hominem.

&gt; A dictionary

Which dictionary?

&gt; I have described to you repeatedly now how belief in a god is not necessarily a religious belief.

No, you have only asserted this.  Of course belief in god is a religious belief, by definition.

Merium-Webster
Religion
: the belief in a god or in a group of gods
: an organized system of beliefs, ceremonies, and rules used to worship a god or a group of gods
: an interest, a belief, or an activity that is very important to a person or group

To be religious all you have to do is believe, by definition.

&gt; The many deists that have described their beliefs to me.

You say deism isn't a religion and yet they have religious beliefs.

&gt; The answer to OP given this is of course no.

Yes, until you actually bother to read what I have written, until you actually present an argument rather than make up your own definitions and until you do something other than resort to ad hominems then I have absolutely no interest in continuing this conversation.  I did google ""define religion"" but apparently you didn't and instead you resorted to using your own made-up definition.

&gt; you should know really the meanings of the words you use.

You clearly don't know the meaning of the word ""religion"" and chose to make up a definition for yourself.

&gt; And that doesn't make [deism] a religion, or a religious belief. Kind of funny you accuse me of making naked assertions, but provide no arguments as to why your position is true.

The onus is on you to show that deism is not a religion: deists believe in god and therefore they are religious and they have a religion and they are not atheists.  You haven't offered any argument to back up any of your assertions, in particular the assertion that deism is not a religion.",2015-10-08 10:37:22+00:00,cvsc3my,16.0,t1_cvsbfr4,2879.0,DebateReligion
2876,"&gt; So deliberately obtuse it is. :( 

If that's the way you want to be.
 
&gt;&gt; Assertion is not an argument.

&gt; But what is it that I'm doing? 

Yes.  You are begging the question by claiming that religion necessarily means worship.  Religious people are not necessarily people who actively worship and deists would consider themselves religious.

&gt; Do you honestly believe I'm blindly asserting something without providing reasons to support said argument?

That is all you've done without exception.

&gt; P1: Religion is defined as belief in and worship of a deity. 

According to Merium-Webster, religion is

"": the belief in a god or in a group of gods
: an organized system of beliefs, ceremonies, and rules used to worship a god or a group of gods [or]
: an interest, a belief, or an activity that is very important to a person or group""

Religion does not necessarily include worship.  You are making up your own definition and thus assuming what you want to prove.

&gt; P2: It is possible to believe in and not worship a deity, these people do not have a religion

This is an assertion based on your opinion only.  In any case, it is irrelevant because people who have religious beliefs have a religion, by definition.

&gt; P3: People who believe in a deity are not atheists

Yes and people who do NOT believe in a deity ARE atheists.  We are done here.  Finally you agree with my entire argument.  All that you have to offer from this point on will be more ad hominems.

&gt; C: It is possible to not hold a religion but to still hold a belief in a deity. (possible to be non-religious and an atheist). 
&gt;
&gt; Evidence for C: THESE PEOPLE EXIST! you can go out and talk to one, exciting I know :) 

More baseless assertion.  It is also illogical: if people have religipous beliefs then they have religion.  Does a Christian not have a religion just because he doesn't go to church regularly?  You are confusing having a religion with belonging to a particular sect.  

&gt; This is not a new argument, I've presented this logic to you multiple times now.

You haven't presented any logic at all.  I wish you would start using logic.

&gt; Do you retract your statement all I do is make assertions without argument? 

Will you admit that you have done absolutely nothing except make baseless assertions?

&gt; The answer to OP is no. Being non-religious doesn't automatically mean you're an atheist. 

Please provide an argument to back this up.

&gt; So lets examine your argument. 
&gt;
&gt; 1) The belief in god is a religious belief. 2) People who have no religious beliefs therefore do not believe in any gods. 3) People who have no religious beliefs are therefore atheist by definition.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the goalpost you have moved is to stop talking about religion and start talking about religious belief. OP asked about religion.

Bt definition, people who have religion have religious beliefs.  Thus if you have no religion then you have no religious beliefs.  If you have no religious beliefs then you are atheist.  Why is this so hard for you to understand?

&gt; So to get back to deism (sorry deists). They would under your definition hold a religious belief (the belief in god) but do not have a religion (which is what OP asks about). 

Stop being deliberately obtuse.  They have religious belief and therefore they have religion.  If they didn't have religion then they wouldn't have religious beliefs and they would be atheist.

&gt; It is a simple one, two, three argument and you haven't even addressed it.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope I've addressed it now.

Nope.  You still haven't even begun to address anything I have said.

&gt; Could you return the courtesy and address my points? You've failed to do so so far. 

I have done nothing but address your points.  

&gt;&gt; The idea of ""worship"" doesn't even come into it.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh but it does, It's right there in the definition of religion.

It's right there in the definition of religion you created for yourself.

&gt; It's one reason deism isn't considered a religion. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism

""Deism gained prominence among intellectuals during the Age of Enlightenment—especially in Britain, France, Germany and the United States—who, raised as Christians, believed in one god but became disenchanted with organized religion""

Nobody except you would claim that deism is not a religion: deism clearly involves belief in god.  Just because deists were disenchanted with organized religion does NOT mean they weren't religious.

2891,"According to Merium Webster, there are two definitions of atheism:

a:  a disbelief in the existence of deity 
b:  the doctrine that there is no deity 

You are an atheist if you don't believe that any gods exist.  You don't have to actually believe that no gods exist.  Thus newborn babies are trivially atheist although they may immediately find themselves regarding certain adults as godlike: Freud said that a personal god (ie one that is believed to perform miracles upon the believer's request) is an ""exalted father figure"".  

There are people who believe that no gods exist and this is the strong atheist position which is the opposite of the strong theist position in which people claim to be certain that their god exists.  The weak atheist position is a default position in that the person lacks belief in any gods but also is not certain if any gods exist.  Weak atheists often describe themselves as agnostic which is a person who claims that the existance of a deity is unknowable.*  Weak theists can also be agnostic: for example, Blaise Pascal considered himself a theist but he argued that God actually  MIGHT not exist but that he also MIGHT exist in which case we should go to church and worship just in case.

Most strong atheists would be willing to believe in a god if there were any evidence whatsoever for his, her or its existence.  Another question is whether or not by ""god"" you mean an intelligent designer who created the universe, some sort of supernatural intelligence who is looking after us or some sort of supernatural force that believers can draw upon.  Strong atheists can be quite confident that the Christian god does not exist but it might be harder to disprove other supernatural claims like feng shui, ghosts and acupuncture.

*Merium Webster defines ""agnostic"" as ""a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (as God) is unknown and probably unknowable; broadly:  one who is not committed to believing in either the existence or the nonexistence of God or a god""  An agnostic is, by default, a weak atheist but could also be a practicing (weak) theist.

One more point I wish to address: you say ""religion does not automatically imply the belief in a god"" but if a religious person does not believe in any gods then that religious person is, by definition, atheist.  Is there such a thing as an atheist religion?  It depends on your definition of god: feng shui is a religious belief and there is no god in geng shui unless you consider god to be some sort of supernatural force that believers can draw upon (in this case by moving furniture).  In principle you can have an atheist religion but in practice all religions have supernatural beliefs** that are equivalent to belief in a deity.  Without supernatural beliefs you don't have a religion: you have a philosophy.  Many atheists describe themselves as ""secular humanists"" and secular humanists tend to share philiosophic beliefs but philosophical beliefs are not religious beliefs; you can believe that one should ""do unto others as you would want them to do to you"" without believing that a deity has told us to do so.

So let me also address the claim ""religion is a system of beliefs, which often addresses the existence of deities but not necessarily so"".  I would say that religions are philosophies that include supernatural beliefs.  There are people who consider themselves atheist who nevertheless believe in ghosts.  Individual self-described atheists can have religious beliefs but if you don't have any religious (ie supernatural) beliefs then you are clearly an atheist.

**I have been informed by Taoists that Taoists believe in Heaven and Hell but not necessarily in a deity.  Also Buddhists may or may not believe in a deity.  (Buddha never claimed to be a god although some Buddhists will pray to Buddha.)  I don't know how any of this works: Buddhists believe in reincarnation and they believe in karma so presumably people who do good things will be very lucky in their next life but who decides who has been good and who has been bad?  Similarly, who decides who goes to Heaven or who goes to Hell if there is no deity making these decisions?  It is difficult for outsiders to understand people's beliefs and sometimes believers themselves are not very good at describing their own beliefs.",2015-10-07 10:37:43+00:00,cvr4pac,1.0,t3_3ntb2v,11515.0,DebateReligion

2908,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Albert_Einstein#Personal_god_and_the_afterlife

""On 24 April 1929, Einstein cabled Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein in German: ""I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals himself in the harmony of all that exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.""[9] He expanded on this in written answers he gave to a Japanese scholar on his views on science and religion, which appeared as a limited edition publication, on the occasion of Einstein's 50th birthday:
 

Scientific research can reduce superstition by encouraging people to think and view things in terms of cause and effect. Certain it is that a conviction, akin to religious feeling, of the rationality and intelligibility of the world lies behind all scientific work of a higher order... This firm belief, a belief bound up with a deep feeling, in a superior mind that reveals itself in the world of experience, represents my conception of God. In common parlance this may be described as ""pantheistic"" (Spinoza).[10]

In a letter to Beatrice Frohlich, 17 December 1952 Einstein stated, ""The idea of a personal God is quite alien to me and seems even naïve.""[11] Eric Gutkind sent a copy of his book ""Choose Life: The Biblical Call To Revolt""[12] to Einstein in 1954. Einstein sent Gutkind a letter in response and wrote, ""The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. These subtilised interpretations are highly manifold according to their nature and have almost nothing to do with the original text.""[13][14][15]

On the question of an afterlife Einstein stated to a Baptist pastor, ""I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it.""[16] This sentiment was also expressed in Einstein's The World as I See It, stating: ""I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the type of which we are conscious in ourselves. An individual who should survive his physical death is also beyond my comprehension, nor do I wish it otherwise; such notions are for the fears or absurd egoism of feeble souls. Enough for me the mystery of the eternity of life, and the inkling of the marvellous structure of reality, together with the single-hearted endeavour to comprehend a portion, be it never so tiny, of the reason that manifests itself in nature.""[17]
 
On 22 March 1954 Einstein received a letter from Joseph Dispentiere, an Italian immigrant who had worked as an experimental machinist in New Jersey. Dispentiere had declared himself an atheist and was disappointed by a news report which had cast Einstein as conventionally religious. Einstein replied on 24 March 1954:
 

It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.[18]

2917,"The problem with the Phase 2 movies is that the scripts had been worked on for years.  Age of Ultron, for example, was based on ideas that Whedon had for the first Avengers movie but then he was told that the story had to involve Loki and the cosmic cube.  That turned out fine.  Ant Man, similarly, was based on an idea by Edgar Wright that he had before the Avengers came out.  (Whedon wanted to use Wasp in the Avengers but Wright had her missing and presumed dead.)  Similarly, the Whedons couldn't use Hydra in Agents of SHIELD because Captain America: the Winter Soldier was going to reveal that Hydra was secrety working within SHIELD and AOS couldn't spoil that surprise.  Even Captain America: Civil War was reportedly something that Feige wanted when they were doing Iron Man, Captain America and the Avengers in Phase 1.  With both the Dark World and Guardians of the Galaxy taking place (mostly) off world it's true that they haven't had an opportunity to reference the TV shows yet.  It's really up to Jon Watts how much the Spider-Man movie references the TV shows: presumably they are still writing the script.  Doctor Strange probably won't reference the TV shows but there was a rumor that Doctor Strange would appear on one of the Netflix shows (specifically Iron Fist) so there's that possibility.  The best opportunity for a TV / movies crossover would be a new Blade movie because he could appear on a Netflix series first and then a Blade movie could return the favor by giving cameos to Daredevil, Power Man, Iron Fist, etc. ",2015-09-30 10:47:17+00:00,cvj53gy,1.0,t3_3mxf0i,21721.0,marvelstudios

2927,"Yes and no.  A lot of Japanese porn has storylines that involve nerdy guys who are finally able to score with their dream girl.  The people who make Japanese porn see horny nerdy guys as their target demographic and it makes sense for the actors to appear as nerdy as them: if they found big strong (relatively) well endowed guys who the women found handsome then this would (presumably) only serve to make their target demographic feel even less secure about themselves because it would remind them that their own physique and equipment would not be enough.  This leads to the second problem, namely that none of these guys are ever the actual star of the movie and sometimes their faces are obscured with mosaics along with their dicks.  There is really no reason why a well endowed physically fit Japanese guy would do mainstream Japanese porn.  It would make sense if the actors in Japanese porn really were nerdy guys who saw it as an opportunity to score with a hot Japanese girl.   The overseas market is slightly different so they will use guys with more muscles and larger equipment for uncensored porn.  During the nineties they even had a big muscular guy who was nicknamed ""helicopter man"" because he would have sex with a girl and be on top of her and he wouldn't use his hands or feet for support and would be grinding away in mid-air: he appeared in the old Samurai porn series, the first series of Japanese pornos made for the Western market, and Ed Powers traveled to Japan to meet him in person.

Seriously, according to Leviticus, we are not supposed to wear leather, eat pork, wear mixed fabrics, worship other gods (assuming they existed), lie with a man as you would a woman or get a tattoo.  It's pretty obvious that these were the laws of primitive homophobic men.

""the contingency argument"" assumes that there exists an ultimate cause.  The problem is that there may not be any time t=0 when the universe began: it is true that the universe started 13.7 billion years ago but there is not only no evidence of anything existing before that but also no reason to believe that time and space itself even existed.  Basically as you go back farther in time you not only approach a state of zero entropy (which is presumably impossible) but also a singularly (which is also presumably impossible).  A singularity would cause space to collapse in on itself and time to stop.  Indeed, as you approached a singularity it would be like approaching a black hole and time does stop at the event horizon of a black hole, as Hawking himself has pointed out.

""the historical case for the resurrection"" is zero.  The Christ story was completely made up.  We don't even know if Jesus existed.

So, you have, basically, nothing whatsoever to offer.  That is what I thought.

&gt; many of these arguments—which are perfectly intellectually respectable 

Your biases are showing.

&gt; They are motivated not by the free exercise of reason but by paradigm pressures and presuppositional worldview commitments.

2947,"It's not a question of what I want or don't want.  Obviously I would want there to be a Heaven after I died.  Even going to Hell would be better than life simply ending.  

But the fact is that it is false: the world would look a lot different if Christian theism were true.  For one thing, there's no way that a 13.7 billion year old universe that is at least 40 billion light years across and filled with 100s of billions of galaxies each with 100s of billions of stars was created just for us.  There's no way that bacteria and fish and frogs and reptiles and mammals evolved just simply so we could be here today.  There's no way that the creator of such a universe would be concerned about where guys put their penises.  And there is no indication that religious people are favored by an unseen god, let alone that any of their prayers are answered.  And if this god actually wanted people to believe that he, she or it existed then it would provide some evidence of its existence.  In fact, it seems like a waste to create this universe all for us and then send the ""good people"" onto Heaven.  This god of yours is supposed to be omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent so why let good people suffer at all?  Why not simply send people onto Heaven now and have all their needs catered for?  If he knows who the good people are and he has the power to send them to paradise then there is no need to make people suffer.  It doesn't make any sense.

The real question is, in the face of all the reality that you actually see before you, why you would actually believe in Christian theism.  Could it be you have... a bias?",2015-09-27 06:09:07+00:00,cvfkk3z,1.0,t3_3mj940,14577.0,DebateAnAtheist

2966,"&gt; If you think that science explains everything then answer me this. What is ethical?

Is it ethical to eat pork?  How about beef?  Are we allowed to wear tattoos?  Are we allowed to wear leather?  Can we appear in public without a turban or a head scarf?  If we are a woman, are we allowed to drive, attend sports functions or appear anywhere with a man who is not a relative?  Religion is not a source of morality: religion is a source of oppression.  People instinctively know what is right and wrong and are capable of writing just laws that aren't based on any particular religious belief or practice.

&gt; What is Beautiful?

Religion does not tell us what is beautiful.  That is a matter of aesthetics.  We decide for ourselves what we think is beautiful.  Typically beauty is the absence of ugliness where ugly things are things that we are instinctively repelled by.  By contrast, beautiful things are things we are drawn to.  It is a survival instinct. 

&gt; What is morality?

See ethics above.

&gt; What created the laws of physics on which most of atheism's arguments lie?

There is no need for a creator.  If there were a need for a creator then who created the creator?

&gt; And perhaps most importantly, what caused the Big Bang?

The big bang does not need a cause because it is the time of minimum entropy and as entropy cannot be zero there was no time t=0 and hence no cause.  Look at it another way: as the universe becomes more dense with matter and energy, space time is curved to the point where time slows down.  In the limit where the universe would be infinitely dense, time stops.  There is, therefore, no time before or even at the big bang so there is no need to assign a cause.  Really, the only reason we worry about it is because we think of time as something that we experience in only one direction: if we could travel back in time we would see the big bang as a barrier we could not cross and not as a beginning. 

&gt; The God I believe in is not some god of the gaps,

Actually, that is exactly what you have just described.

&gt; he is a God of everything, known and unknown. You telling me that the vast complexity of life, and our universe is completely random

No, it's not.  We have gravity.  We have electromagnetism.  We have nuclear forces.  We have natural selection.  What we don't have is an intelligence controlling everything.  The universe would look a lot different if there were some intelligence out there, especially if the universe were created just for us.  The universe is about 13.7 billion years old and the observable universe is about 40 billion light years across.  Mankind has lived scarcely 2 million years and individual people typically less than a hundred years.  We live on a typical planet around a typical star and the next sun is several light years away.  We are in a galaxy with hundreds of billions of stars and there are hundreds of billions of galaxies.  The universe is vast and ancient in ways that we cannot even imagine.  And yet you believe that all this was created just for us?  That this is all a temporary home for mankind before people are sent to Heaven or Hell?  That the creator of all that cares whether your sports teams wins or whether you are having sex with the right people even while he doesn't care about starving children in Africa or people dying of deadly diseases?  That is arrogance of a level I can't even comprehend.

&gt; is like saying that if you put the ingredients for a cake in a box for 13 billion years and shake it around then when you open it up there'll be a perfectly made cake inside.

No, that would be like climbing a mountain by jumping straight up which is not what we do: we take a path to the mountain top and get there one step at a time.

&gt; I'm sorry that you've lost the way God

No such thing.  Please do NOT inflict your fantasies on people who actually use their brains to think.

&gt; has set for you, and pray you find it again.

You pray and I think.

&gt; But let me leave you with one final thing to ponder. if I'm wrong, then when I die i'll just be gone and won't care about whether I was right or wrong about God in my life, but if YOU'RE wrong, then you'll miss out on the greatest party of all eternity all because you looked at the invitation and scoffed at it. God bless.

There is no Heaven or Hell or Valhalla or Hades.  You are just deluding yourself so what you are presenting a false choice.  It is basically a choice between being a rational thinking human being and coming across as a complete idiot.  I have made my choice and, unfortunately for you, so have you.

It is also scary that you believe you wouldn't care about right or wrong if there was no god.  Look at what is going on in the middle East and in Africa right now: there are people who believe in God who don't care about right or wrong because they believe God is on their side and he lets them do what they want.  Meanwhile there are proportionally far more atheists studying in universities than wasting time in jails.

2973,"We can only observe the natural world because that's all there is.  You think that there must be things we can't explain and that these things must be God.  Why do you insist that there be thing we can't explain?  We couldn't explain volcanoes or earthquakes or thunderstorms and they were all declared ""acts of God"" but now we can explain these things and the term ""act of God"" is now considered an expression.  What sort of things do you think we can't explain and why would we need a god to explain them?  The fact is that all the things that we used to consider supernatural, the things that we actually knew existed, are now considered natural occurrences.  We really don't have much else that hasn't been explained.  

I remember I once asked my high school chemistry teacher why some elements had fractional atomic weights.  He said ""God made them that way"".  He didn't know about isotopes.  He didn't know about nuclear binding energies.  And he was a chemistry teacher.  This is my point: it is not your fault that you are badly educated and that there are things that only require supernatural explanations.  You probably had teachers who were badly educated themselves.  Worse, you may have had teachers who were outright theists who figured ""God did it"" was a valid answer to a scientific question.

The fact is that when we explain something that used to be considered supernatural is then suddenly seen as a natural phenomenon.  Everything that actually happens, everything that people don't just imagine, can be observed and measured and thus explained.  If something is supernatural then, by definition, it does not exist as part of the natural world.  What is the mechanism by which something that is supernatural interacts with the physical world?  If the supernatural is not something physical that we can see and touch then how does it even interact with us.

&gt; This is due to the law of conservation of energy. 

We also have the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

Yes, there has to have been at least one thing that happened for no reason and that is the universe itself.  The fact that things happen all the time for no apparent reason makes it that much more plausible that the universe could have begun that way.  Basically we imagine a universe so dense and so hot that quantum uncertainty applies.  Another consideration is general relativity: when the universe is that dense time effectively stops; the more the universe is packed together the more time slows down and there becomes less and less need to find an ""ultimate cause"" because we can say unequivocally that time itself began at the same time the universe began.  To put it bluntly we won't need to find an ultimate cause if there was no actual time t=0.

3006,"&gt; Unless of course you consider ""you're a dick"" to be the worst possible insult.

Why do people have to throw around insults at all?  It is just childish.  I also don't appreciate your sarcasm.  It's not a wish list at all: I don't really care for a She Hulk movie but I can see how maybe they could make the character work if they focused on having her be a strong female character as opposed to just a female version of the Hulk.  This is actually a problem that Marvel will face as they move forward: they have a choice between recasting actors and trying to explain in story why the characters never age or they have to introduce characters that are younger versions of the characters they already have.  That is actually a bit risky because it was the actors that they chose to play the Avengers that worked on screen as much as the characters themselves and younger actors might not be taken seriously.

As for Avengers vs. X-Men, well, the basic problem is that Marvel doesn't have the rights to all of its characters, obviously, but as many people have pointed out it would be a win win situation if Fox and Marvel could agree to do a crossover film.  And yes I am implicitly assuming that Marvel would get back the rights to the Fantastic Four in ten years.  Right now the Fantastic Four is box office poison but when Marvel gets the rights back then there is going to be interest in Marvel's version of the Fantastic Four.  I still think a solo Fantastic Four movie would be a tough sell though.  As time goes on every movie Marvel makes is going to be a tough sell because people will feel as though they have seen everything.  At least if Marvel continues to make solo movies then they can have movies with fewer characters and hence fewer actors to pay and a smaller story that won't cost as much money to make.  Not every movie needs to be a major blockbuster but they do need to schedule at least one major tent pole movie a year or else interest in the genre will start to wane.

Finally, keep in mind that Feige himself stated that he had plans for Marvel movies until 2028 and that was before the Spider-Man deal so we can imagine that those plans have been shifted back at least a couple of years.  Instead of being so disagreeable perhaps you could come up with some suggestions yourself as to what they could do.  I think I was being very conservative assuming that Marvel would continue to make three films a year, continue to make phases with ten movies each, continue to market movies as being parts of trilogies, focus on existing characters like the Black Widow, Hawkeye, War Machine, Falcon, Vision, Scarlet Witch etc., none of whom could carry a movie by themselves but all of whom will have brand recognition by the time Marvel has room in their schedule to make a movie about them.  I thought I was being very conservative limiting the new franchises to Blade, She-Hulk and Ms. Marvel.  If it were really a wish list then I would have made more implausible choices.  I don't think, for example, that a movie based on Runaways fits in with their overall plan.   

&gt; on with the discussion you so desperately need

&gt; you are ""the bad guy""

&gt; this is who you come across as

&gt; as a ""a bad guy"" with a short fuse

Wouldn't it feel better to apologize for having been such an asshole in your last post and continuing to be an asshole in this post?  I made this post because I like to think far ahead and wonder where Marvel will be ten to fifteen years from now and how they can make it last that far.  I don't see it lasting forever because the actors aren't getting any younger.  Maybe if they have a Young Avengers team with Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk, Blade's daughter and Stature (Cassie Lang) then they will have something that will click the way the Avengers has clicked but one obvious problem is that those characters are all female.  Is that what we are going to see as we move forward, a mostly all female group of younger Avengers?  Would that work?  It might.  Otherwise Marvel's movie making machine will come to a halt before the end of Phase 7 in 2032.

""The 1993 study by Hamer examined 114 families of gay men in the United States and found increased rates of homosexuality among maternal uncles and cousins, but not among paternal relatives. This pattern of inheritance suggested that there might be linked genes on the x-chromosome, since males always inherit their copy of the x-chromosome from their mothers. Polymorphisms of genetic markers of the x-chromosome were analyzed to see if a specific marker was shared by a disproportionate amount of brothers who were both gay. The results showed that among gay brothers, the concordance rate for markers from the Xq28 region were significantly greater than expected for random Mendelian segregation, indicating that a link did exist.[6]

""A follow-up study, conducted in 1995 by the Hamer lab in collaboration with two groups of statistical experts, corroborated the original results for males with homosexual brothers sharing Xq28 at significantly elevated rates. This study also included heterosexual brothers, who showed significantly less than expected sharing of the Xq28 region, as expected for a genetic locus that in one form is associated with same-sex attraction and in another form is associated with opposite-sex attraction. In this study no link to Xq28 was found among homosexual females, indicating a different genetic pathway as for most sex-specific phenotypes.[7]""

Because you are denying the experiences of people who one day realize that they are gay.  They don't ""decide"" to be gay any more than you ""decide"" to be straight.  The fact that two brothers can grow up in the same environment and yet one becomes gay and the other doesn't begs the question as to why one brother would be gay and the other isn't.  A genetic explanation would go a long way to explaining this: one boy inherited the genes for homosexuality from his mother and the other didn't (because women have two X chromosomes and it would be unlikely that both X chromosome carries the genes for homosexuality).  On the other hand, you have the identical twin studies which show that there has to be environmental pressure.

It is far less likely that anybody who would otherwise be straight woke up one morning and decided to be gay despite all the pressure from parents and society against homosexuality.

You say I said ""genetically predetermined"" but I know for a fact I never said that.  You may be quoting from your poor memory.  Nothing is completly genetically predetermined because obviously you could get hit by a bus on your tenth birthday and never know what your sexuality was.

&gt; google; asexual; ""without sexual feelings or associations."", babies don't have those as far we know, so calling them asexual is correct

If at all possible, I would advise against you denying the fact that people do naturally develop sexual feelings.  We can see this in the animal kingdom: a male cat, for example, who was separated from his mother will respond favorably to a female cat introduced into the same house.  Kittens will emerge*.  

*The case of cats is slightly different from that of humans.  Cats respond to pheronomes.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that cats are physically attracted to other cats the way humans are physically attracted to members of the opposite or same sex.  Cats will literally sleep with other cats regardless of gender and this is probably more of a question of socializing and sharing warmth than foreplay.

That being said, there has been talk about cats being gay.

and so on.

This was before the deal with Sony over Spider-Man.  The Spiderman movie in 2017 pushed back the schedule of movies so if we figure six or seven Spider-Man movies over the next 15 years (including a Sinister Six movie which Sony says they are still working on) then that will push their plans back to 2031 at least.  

On top of that, I explained in the subject line!  It's right there!  ""Assuming ten movies in a phase (starting with Phase 3) and at least 3 movies a year (starting in 2017) the MCU could last until 2032.""  It's just math!  Phase 3 starts next year (2016) so if you have 5 more phases (including phase 3) with ten movies each (including Spider-Man movies) then that's 50 movies and if you have 3 movies a year starting in 2017 then that's (48 years)/3 = 16 years so, yeah, that brings us to the year 2032.  It's not that difficult.  

Basically we know that whatever plans Feige had from now until 2028 will now go from now until 2030 at least.  His plan might include vague ideas like Avengers 5, 6, 7, ... 10 and not have any idea what their plots would be or he might have been mulling over a trilogy of Black Widow films.  It's fun to think about.  They may have had a contingency in case the Fantastic Four movie bombed and they got all the Fantastic Four characters back: it would be great if they had Galactus, the Silver Surfer, the Skrulls, Doctor Doom, Kang, etc.  The idea of getting Spider-Man back from Sony was something that they probably never expected to happen but we know that they wanted to get the Silver Surfer back because there were negotiations regarding the Silver Surfer when back when the rights to Daredevil lapsed.

So, no, this is not a ""wish list"".  This is speculation.  I am actually speculating about what movies they could make.  There was even speculation on the Fox side about an X-Men / Avengers movie.

Women showed a statistically non-significant trend to weaker influence of hereditary effects, while men showed no effect of shared environmental effects. The use of all adult twins in Sweden was designed to address the criticism of volunteer studies, in which a potential bias towards participation by gay twins may influence the results;
 
""Biometric modeling revealed that, in men, genetic effects explained .34–.39 of the variance [of sexual orientation], the shared environment .00, and the individual-specific environment .61–.66 of the variance. Corresponding estimates among women were .18–.19 for genetic factors, .16–.17 for shared environmental, and .64–.66 for unique environmental factors. Although wide confidence intervals suggest cautious interpretation, the results are consistent with moderate, primarily genetic, familial effects, and moderate to large effects of the nonshared environment (social and biological) on same-sex sexual behavior.[9]""",2015-09-09 10:28:14+00:00,cuvg2as,8.0,t1_cuvfzzt,266.0,atheism

""A number of twin studies have attempted to compare the relative importance of genetics and environment in the determination of sexual orientation.

In 2000 Bailey, Dunne and Martin studied a larger sample of 4,901 Australian twins but reported less than half the level of concordance.[5] They found 20% concordance in the male identical or MZ twins and 24% concordance for the female identical or MZ twins. Self reported zygosity, sexual attraction, fantasy and behaviours were assessed by questionnaire and zygosity was serologically checked when in doubt. A meta-study by Hershberger (2001)[6] compares the results of eight different twin studies: among those, all but two showed MZ twins having much higher concordance of sexual orientation than DZ twins, suggesting a non-negligible genetic component.
 
""Bearman and Brückner (2002) criticized early studies concentrating on small, select samples[7] and non-representative selection of their subjects.[8] They studied 289 pairs of identical twins (monozygotic or from one fertilized egg) and 495 pairs of fraternal twins (dizygotic or from two fertilized eggs) and found concordance rates for same-sex attraction of only 7.7% for male identical twins and 5.3% for females, a pattern which they say ""does not suggest genetic influence independent of social context.""[7]""",2015-09-09 10:24:50+00:00,cuvg0ix,10.0,t1_cuvfyf1,249.0,atheism

1) If you go back in time then entropy decreases.  This is almost by definition: entropy increases as time passes.  But entropy cannot go below zero.  So, yes, you have to have a beginning of time.  This one is pretty obvious.

2) Whereas it may be true that a beginning of time exists this may be seen as an arbitrary point to any 4th dimensional creature that exists outside of our time and space.  To such a creature, directions in time are no different than directions in space and if the universe exists with a finite time and in a finite space then it would just appear to this 4th dimensional creature as an object in fourth dimensional space and there would be nothing inherently special to the beginning and end of time.

3) [his latest] Suppose before the big bang everything in the universe was located at a single point.  The universe would have been infinitely curved as a result of the gravitational distortion of space and time around this point.  As a result, time actually stops when you get to the beginning of the universe.  This then explains why scientists can meaningfully talk about ever increasingly small fractions of seconds ""after"" the big bang.

3074,"Well, obviously, Black Panther, Ant Man, Wasp, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel and Bucky.

Now what if I were to exclude THEM?

Well, for starters, I would also exclude Daredevil, Elektra, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Hellcat because they can't be in movies and Netflix at the same time.  I would also exclude people who have appeared on Agents of SHIELD (Deathlok, Bobbi / Mockingbird, Daisy / Quake and Lincoln / Sparkplug) because they need to populate two teams on TV (Most Wanted and Secret Warriors).

That leaves (excluding characters who are owned by Fox or who would still be children in the MCU) Swordsman, Hercules, Black Knight, Mantis, Moondragon, Wonder Man, Tigra, She-Hulk, Photon, Starfox, Namor, Doctor Druid, Moon Knight, Firebird, Gilgamesh, U.S. Agent, Quasar, Sersi, Stingray, Living Lightning, Spider-Woman, Crystal, Thunderstrike, Darkhawk, Justice, Firestar, Triathlon, Silverclaw, Jack of Hearts, Captain Britain, Sentry, Echo, Ares, Jocasta, Valkyrie, Sharon Carter, Nova, Protector, Doctor Strange, Red Hulk, Manifold, Shang-Chi, Captain Universe, Smasher, Abyss, Ex Nihilo, Nightmask, Star Brand, Blade, Blue Marvel, White Tiger, Kaluu, Doctor Voodoo, Shroud, Marrina, Yellowjacket, Magdalene,  Deathcry, Ms. Marvel and Miles Morales. 

Yeah, hardly anybody to choose from, eh?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Avengers_members

Well, I didn't know Blade was in the Avengers.  Apparently he was calling himself ""Ronin"".  Having Blade a member of the Avengers makes sense although Wesley Snipes is getting too old to play him so... never mind then.

Also, I think we can exclude any non-Asgardian gods as that would be a bit much.  We need female and ethnic characters but I would exclude any characters that would be mere eye candy or would come across as stereotypes.  I would also leave out characters that are just lame.

That leaves us with Wonder Man, Moon Knight, Firebird, Quasar, Spider-Woman, Valkyrie, Sharon Carter, Nova, Doctor Strange, Shang-Chi and Ms. Marvel.

Well, alright then.

Some characters will need to join Secret Warriors.  I would guess that Secret Warriors could consist of Daisy / Quake and Lincoln / Sparkplug plus Slingshot, Firebird, Cloak and Dagger.  Other characters that could be introduced on Agents of SHIELD are Spider-Woman, Moon Knight and Shang-Chi.

So, finally, to answer your original question, we could have a team consisting of Wonder Man, Quasar, Sharon Carter, Nova, Valkyrie and Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan).  I don't think Doctor Strange is suited to an Avengers team because he is too powerful by himself.  I would substitute Sif for Valkyrie.  Wonder Man could be introduced in the comics as somebody Baron Zemo experimented on: he is sent to fight the Avengers but instead joins them.  I would have Quasar be a Kree and Nova a Xandarian and this would make an interesting dynamic because their planets had been enemies.  

And that, ladies and gentlemen, would be my answer to OP's question.

3092,"The Chinese also used base 60.  There are Chinese records that say that the Chinese and the Sumerians did not develop their clocks and calendars independently, specifically that the silk trade had already begun way back then and they had indirect contact with the Sumerians through the Turks.  In China, therefore, we also had 12 hour days (for a full cycle) and 12 months in a solar year.  Solar calendars were used in ancient farmers to determine when to plant seeds and harvest crops even though people continued to mark their birthdays and other special occasions using the lunar calendar.  The solar calendar that the Chinese adopted was the same as the Sumerian solar calendar but they named the months after Chinese animals (the snake, the dog, the tiger, etc.) as opposed to western animals (the crab, the scorpion, etc.).  Because ordinary people did not use a solar calendar, astrology based on months did not catch on but astrology based on a twelve year cycle did catch on and is still used to this day.  A complete cycle in the Chinese calendar is 60 years and includes both the twelve animals in the Chinese zodiac and the five elements from Chinese mythology (wood, metal, fire, water and air).

3093,"We have twelve hours in a day (and twelve hours in a night) because the clock was designed with twelve sections.  Imagine trying to make a clock with ten sections!  Twelve sections is easy: you start with four quadrants and then construct equilateral triangles to give you 60 degree angles and half of 60 degrees is 30 degrees.  Voila!  Incidentally, the clock used to represent a 12 hour day (including both day and night).  The Romans introduced the 24 hour day because the sun dials only worked during the day: the Romans literally divided the day into 12 hours and the night into 12 hours so the hours were literally longer in the summer than in the winter!

Also, the first clocks were the first calendars as well: lunar calendars predated solar calendars so the idea of a month was well known by the time people introduced solar calendars.  Because a month lasts 29-30 days they decided to make a solar calendar with months of 30-31 days.  Again, this is done by dividing a 365 day year into 12 months.  The first solar calendars started and ended on the spring solstice and the four quadrants on the clock-like calendar represent the four seasons: the old Sumerian solar calendar is still used to this day when you check your horoscope! 

One other fact: the fact that a year has 365 days is the reason why a circle is divided into 360 days.  All circles are essentially calendars with 30 degrees representing one month.  All circles are also clocks as every degree contains 60 arcminutes and every arcminute contains 60 arcseconds.",2015-09-01 09:32:41+00:00,cumuuud,4.0,t1_cumc0t7,40923.0,askscience

3128,"&gt; Argument from apparent free will - it seems patently obvious that you and I are agents, capable of making choices. All ""proofs"" of determinism I've seen so far have essentially been ""we learned something about how brains work. Therefore, no free will.""

This isn't obvious at all.  Can you prove that you have free will?  Can you prove that a robot does not have free will?  We know a robot does not have free will because somebody programmed it but the question is can you prove that a robot does not have free will by observation alone?  And what part of this proof then would not apply to human beings?

&gt; Argument from utility - it is more useful by far to assume that people are agents to some degree, in terms of morality, capability, and... pretty much everything. Speaking of which...

Just because something is useful to believe doesn't mean it is true.  It is useful for a dictator to make his people think he is the greatest ruler ever and that they couldn't live without him but that doesn't make it true.

&gt; Argument from morality - one can only be said to be responsible for their actions if they are the ones who decided to perform said actions. If there is no free will, there is no moral responsibility, despite what soft determinists might say.

No, this is not true.  We put people in jail not simply to punish them but to prevent them from committing the same crime again.  If someone truly cannot help themselves then there is every reason to arrest them and put them in jail.  They do not escape responsibility for their actions just because they cannot help themselves.

&gt; In fact, I see statements like ""we have no free will, but that doesn't mean there is no responsibility"" as little more than ""I like the idea of moral responsibility when condemning actions I don't like, but I also want to be able to abandon it at the drop of a hat by saying that people have no control over their own actions.""

This is a strawman argument.

The fact is that we don't have free will because although we do what we want to do we do not choose what we want to do and are not capable of doing something that we neither were forced to do by someone else nor wanted to do ourselves.

3130,"&gt; If there is no free will, there is no such thing as love, kindness, forgiveness, grace or mercy.

Nonsense.  That is literally an appeal to emotions.  You still experience love and forgiveness: you just don't choose whom you love or when you forgive.

&gt; Without free will they are all cruel illusions.

I don't know why you are assigning cruelty to unfeeling nature.

&gt; We can only have love, etc., if we choose it.

Nonsense.  Can you choose to love someone?  Can you choose to stop loving someone?  Have you ever been in love?  Could you choose to not love that person?

&gt; Otherwise it's not love at all.

If you can choose whether or not you love someone then it is not love at all.

&gt; Our life experiences show us that love is real, and not an illusion at all, and therefore free will is necessary.

The fact that love is real, the fact that we are driven by forces that are not are choosing, is precisely why we don't have free will.

&gt; The Bible says the same thing.

Please don't bring in your book of myths.  It is not a book of science and it most certainly is not a psychology textbook.

&gt; It's impossible for love to exist where we are robotically determined, and so free will is not only logical, but necessary.

First of all, you need to quote the line that says this.  Then you would be proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that your Bible is completely worthless nonsense.

&gt; and so free will is not only logical, but necessary.

It is neither logical nor real and certainly not necessary.  Your Bible has a perfect track record of talking about things that are neither logical nor real nor necessary.

&gt; We also know that any creature, human or animal, that has self-awareness also has self-direction, and therefore has free will.

We can program a computer to say ""I am a computer.""  It does not have free will.  Awareness does not imply free will at all.

&gt; It's impossible—from what we know about life, from our definitions of these words, and from the Bible itself—that free will does not exist.

From what you ""know"".  I know that your Bible is a book of myths.  Did you know that or were you under the impression there was actually some truth to what is said in the Bible?  Because if you thought there was some truth, any at all, to what it says in the Bible then you are sadly mistaken.

&gt; You make a mistake

Nope.

&gt; to think that my knowledge

Demonstrate that you have knowledge.  Do not just state that you do.

&gt; that you aren't going to buy what I'm saying is any different qualitatively from God

Your imaginary friend

&gt; 's knowledge that you aren't going to buy what I'm saying. You are interposing arbitrary criteria into ""knowledge"" if you think so.

Perhaps if you were to supply an actual logical argument rather than simply claim that the Bible agrees with you then I wouldn't feel as though you were completely wasting my time.

&gt; Let's talk about your rebuttal that it's impossible for God to have free will.

Go ahead.

&gt; Free will implies choice within the scope of logical and practical possibilities for us. Because I can't choose to locate myself on Pluto five minutes from now doesn't mean that I don't have free will; it just means that there are possibilities outside of the scope of my logical and practical choices. But I can still choose to answer your question or not, to go to the store or not, etc. But I can't choose to go to Pluto or not. So also with God. Choosing the wrong or evil is not existentially or logically possible for a God who is good by nature,

Ah, okay, fine so your imaginary friend doesn't have free will.   That's settled.

&gt; but that doesn't mean he doesn't have free will.

Yes, it does.  You just said so.  Don't backtrack now.  You were making progress.

&gt; He has and exercises free will within the scope of the logical and practical possibilities for him, which are all good and moral. His omnipotence is absurd

I agree.  Omnipotence is absurd.  It is also irrelevant.  The point is that your imaginary friend is supposed to be omniscient which means, in particular, he would always know what is the right thing to do.  If he always does the right thing then he has no choice but to do that thing which is right and therefore even your imaginary friend would lack free will, if he had actually existed.

&gt; if we allow that he is capable of logical contradictions—that he can do things that are impossible or contradictory for him to do. But if we entertain that God is logically consistent, then his free will plays itself out in the avenues of his activity that are not contradictory to his nature.

Right.  So again, because he cannot contradict his own nature, we again arrive at the conclusion that your imaginary friend cannot have free will.  Congratulations.  You are one step closer to achieving secular enlightenment.",2015-08-27 14:31:14+00:00,cuhgzya,8.0,t1_cuhdg3v,7049.0,DebateAChristian

3134,"&gt; You are misunderstanding both issues, so thanks for the opportunity to clarify.

Oh, well, as long as you're not going to be condescending...

&gt; God's omnipotence has nothing to do with his level of involvement in life on earth.

What good is a god that doesn't get involved with life on Earth?

&gt; The fact that he is all-powerful doesn't require that he uses it at all times for all things.


&gt; He can decide where and to what extent he uses his power.

Actually, if God has a plan and can see the future then God himself cannot have free will.  Consider this argument.

1) God is perfect.
2) Therefore God cannot do wrong.
3) Therefore everything God does is right.
4) In addition, God is omniscient so he always knows what is the right thing to do.
5) Because he cannot do wrong and thus must do what is right and he knows what he must do then he has no choice but to do that right  thing.

Thus God himself has no free will as a direct result of being perfectly good and omniscient.

&gt; Nor did I claim that God ""is just an observer."" The Bible indicates that he is involved in some parts of life, influencing the course of some events, but not necessarily all. That is neither a reduction of his omnipotence, his omniscience, nor our free will.

We don't even have free will because we don't decide what we want. We do what we want, yes, but we don't decide what we want. Human beings behave mainly according to instincts. Higher intelligence does not change the reasons why we make decisions.

And you can't argue that ""God gave us free will"" because having an omnipotent omniscient god only makes things worse: an omnipotent omniscient god would be able to create man knowing everything mankind was going to do. Thus not only would man not have free will, he would not be responsible for his actions.

It is like in the myth of the Garden of Eden: not only did he supposedly create Adam and Eve but also the tree of knowledge and the talking snake. If you left your home and you didn't want the kids to play with the gun on the table would you just tell them not to play with the gun or would you lock it up somewhere? Who would actually get the blame if one of the kids got shot while they were playing with the gun, the kids or you for not being a responsible adult?

&gt; And, of course, the Bible does speak of ""a plan"", and that he ""works in mysterious ways."" But if you know the Bible, you know that those phrases are speaking of his plan of salvation. There is nothing in the Bible about God merely observing, nor of his determining everything. There is easily a third choice here that you don't seem to be seeing.

You haven't actually made an argument here.  You are merely claiming that I ""don't seem to be seeing"" the correctness of your claims.",2015-08-26 15:10:03+00:00,cugbd66,6.0,t1_cugb1sh,495.0,DebateAChristian

3137,"&gt;&gt; If God doesn't know the future then he's not God. He is supposed to have a plan, remember?

&gt; That's not an answer to the question I asked. And having a plan != doing everything in one's power to ensure that everything goes according to said plan.

Then what good is he?  What is the point of your god saying he has a plan and not carrying it out?  Is he omnipotent or not?

&gt;&gt; We don't have free will in any case because we don't decide what we want.

&gt; Again, not an answer to the question I asked. This is an argument as to why free will doesn't exist period, not why an omnipotent, omniscient being means that we don't have free will. 

If free will does not exist period then having an omnipotent, omniscient being isn't going to help.

&gt; In order to argue for that, you have to prove that free will would, or at least could, exist otherwise. 

Um, no, if you claim that free will exists in the presence of an omnipotent, omniscient being then you need to show that free will exists AT ALL.  When people argue that ""God gives us free will"" or that ""Free will can exist even though God is omnipotent and omniscient"" they are implicitly making the claim that free will exist at all.  Why on Earth would you expect me to prove that for you?  The onus is on YOU.

&gt; If you don't, you might as well be arguing that square triangles can't exist because E=mc2.

That's just absurd.  

&gt;&gt; an omnipotent omniscient god would be able to create man knowing everything mankind was going to do. This not only would man not have free will, he would not be responsible for his actions.

&gt; Adding a moral judgment to your original claim is not arguing for your original claim.

Please pay attention.

You are providing all the evidence necessary for me to make that rock solid conclusion.

&gt;&gt; If you have heard the argument before and you still don't understand it then it just makes you look bad.

&gt; I've never heard the argument, that's my point. I've heard the claim, and only the claim. For instance, in this lengthy comment, here have been your arguments in response to questions about why omniscience + omnipotence = no free will:

&gt; I'm intelligent, and you don't know many intelligent people
&gt; God is by definition omniscient, and ""has a plan""
&gt; We don't have free will because we can't choose what we want
&gt; God is to blame for every horrible thing that happens because people don't have free will
&gt; You're too stupid to understand I'm right

Straw man.  And, yes, you are incredibly stupid.  You are ""one of those"".

&gt; Notice how nowhere in those ""arguments"" did you even address the reasoning behind your claim that omnipotence + omniscience = no free will.

You are a liar.  You have presented a strawman and you have ignored points I made, for example, about the Garden of Eden and how the presence of an omnipotent, omniscient being makes it difficult for anyone to hold man ultimately responsible for his actions.  You ignore these points because you have no argument against them.

&gt; You either argued against free will in general, restated your claim, or got completely off topic.

It is sad when people like you completely and utterly lack any reading comprehension whatsoever.  

&gt; The closest you came to actually arguing for your claim was ""He is supposed to have a plan, remember?""

The problem with stupid people is that they claim to be right without even offering an argument.  Where is your argument?  The onus of proof is on you to show that free will can exist in the presence of an omnipotent, omniscient being.  You haven't even bothered to show that free will exists at all.  You are strutting around claiming victory without even offering an argument and I strongly suspect the next time somebody presents the exact same argument who will again fail to understand it and claim once again that all they have done is offer a ""claim"".",2015-08-26 14:29:55+00:00,cug9uwv,8.0,t1_cug9880,1041.0,DebateAChristian
3138,"&gt; Oh yay, you're one of those.

Yes, an intelligent person.  You probably don't meet many of us.

&gt; What feature of a world with free will requires that the one who created it not know its future? 

If God doesn't know the future then he's not God.  He is supposed to have a plan, remember?

&gt; What is it about free will that requires the future to be unknown by the being who creates the universe?

We don't have free will in any case because we don't decide what we want.  We do what we want, yes, but we don't decide what we want.  Human beings behave mainly according to instincts.  Higher intelligence does not change the reasons why we make decisions.

And you can't argue that ""God gave us free will"" because having an omnipotent omniscient god only makes things worse: an omnipotent omniscient god would be able to create man knowing everything mankind was going to do.

3146,"Let's take a look at a full list of the characters Marvel is currently featuring in comics (in August and September): X-Men, Wolverine, Apocalypse, MODOK, Korvac, Magneto, Loki, Red Skull, Doctor Doom, Ultron, Deadpool, the Avengers, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, Hawkeye, the Black Widow, Bucky, Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk, Inhumans, Daredevil, Ghost Rider, Ant Man, Silk, Spider-Woman, Guardians of the Galaxy, Runaways, Quake, Mockingbird, Nick Fury, Melinda May, Agent Carter, Agents of SHIELD, Silver Surfer, Captain Britain, Shang Chi, Howard the Duck and Squirrel Girl.  That doesn't include all the trade paperbacks or Star Wars stuff.  Of all these characters, who hasn't been either used already or announced to be appearing in future Marvel movies (including Fox)?  MODOC, Korvac, Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk, Ghost Rider, Silk, Spider-Woman, Runaways, Silver Surfer, Captain Britain, Shang Chi and Squirrel Girl.

Can we therefore conclude that the characters who are appearing in the comics will appear in future Marvel movies?

MODOK could be a future villain in a future War Machine movie.  I know that no War Machine movie has been announced.  Korvac looks like he could be a villain in an Avengers movie after Infinity War Parts 1 and 2.  He could show up first in a Guardians of the Galaxy movie.  A Ms. Marvel TV show was rumored but is probably a long way off.  Spider-Woman could be introduced on Agents of SHIELD.  That leaves She-Hulk, Ghost Rider, Silk, Runaways, Silver Surfer, Captain Britain, Shang Chi and Squirrel Girl plus this new Blade series.

3179,"&gt;&gt; It is fine to talk about the superhero Thor. It is pointless to talk about the god Thor as if he actually exists.

&gt; Why? What if the conversation revolves around that hypothetical case?

To put it in technical terms, the problem with talking about a hypothetical Thor as if he were real is that gods in general are unfalsifiable.  That is to say that if you accept that Asgard is in another dimension then, in theory, it could exist.  Alas the thing about anything supernatural is that they, by definition, do not exist in nature.  If supernatural things were real then by definition we would have a natural explanation for them just as we used to think that earthquakes and thunderstorms were ""acts of God"" but we now know that they have scientific explanations.  It makes no sense to talk about supernatural things because when we label something as ""supernatural"" we stop asking questions and our scientific progress comes to a screeching stop.

&gt; It's a standard facet of conversation to presume the truth of something

It is part of deductive reasoning to make an assumption for the purpose of proving the assumption wrong.  Once you have proven the assumption wrong there is no more point considering the assumption.  You must have completely ignored what I said above because I said that IF a benevolent god WERE to exist then the world would be very different from the one we actually inhabit.  I therefore showed from pure logic that the discussion of imaginary gods is completely and utterly 100% absolutely pointless.

&gt; - I can talk about how the god of the Bible is wicked, using language that presumes he exists, even though I don't actually believe he does.

But in that case you would be describing the god of the Bible as a fictional character and not presuming that it actually exists.

&gt; Talking about Thor as if he exists, isn't necessarily a pointless discussion. Suppose we encounter a genuine Thor-worshipper, and we wanted to demonstrate the falsehood of their beliefs.

That would be completely and utterly 100% absolutely pointless because Thor would be an example of an unfalsifiable god.  The gods of Olympus are falsifiable if you literally believe them to be at the top of Mount Olympus.

&gt; It is an entirely valid approach to go after the belief's internal inconsistency, which requires assuming the beliefs are true, and then showing they lead to an intractable paradox.

You can easily show that a beneficial, all powerful, unknowing god does not exist.  Thor is not all powerful, he is not unknowing and he is not beneficial: he causes thunder after all.  It would be better to just show the Thor-believer the scientific explanation for thunder storms and let them decide for themselves what makes more sense.  It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to waste time entertaining a theist's fantasies.

&gt; It seems you're arbitrarily dismissing a whole category of dialogue - the hypothetical - as necessarily pointless.

Because it is.  Unless you are talking about clearly fictional situations.  (such as ""Who would win in a fight?  Thor or Hercules?"") it is absolutely pointless to talk about imaginary gods.

&gt; Yet it has myriad uses, from small-talk to debate.

The last thing you should do in a debate is entertain your opponent's argument.  Prove them wrong and move on.

3211,"A spin off series with two characters is not enough.  Maybe if they had someone playing Jessica Drew and somebody playing Marc Spector then you would have something.

There are too many characters on Agents of SHIELD.  Besides Bobbi and Hunter, there's Coulson, Skye, May, her husband, Fitz, Simmons, Agent O'Hara, Mac, Deathlok and Lincoln and they promise to add even more characters in Season 3.  So a split makes sense.  Maybe they can split Marvel's Agents of SHIELD into Marvel's Most Wanted and Marvel's Secret Warriors with Coulson, May, her husband, Fitz, Simmons, Agent O'Hara and Mac only appearing in supporting roles.  In fact, I thought May was retiring at the end of last season.  Coulson can do that too: the show isn't about him anymore and now that he's lost his arm he has the perfect excuse to retire.  Even Mac threatened to quit during Season 2 and then only came back when it was revealed that he was working under Fury's instructions all along.  

Actually, the smart thing to do would be to have Fitz and Simmons leave the show(s) and instead appear as support staff at the New Avengers facility.  Of course, that begs the question: what will be their base of operations at the start of Season 3?  The bus is destroyed and operating out of an aircraft carrier doesn't seem very practical.  It would make sense for Coulson and Skye, at least, to move to the New Avengers facility where Skye can assemble and train her Secret Warriors.  Well,  okay, Coulson can't move there because the Avengers still think he's dead but it would make sense for Skye to move there.  It would also make sense for Skye and her team to appear in future Avengers movies.  They would be like the New Mutants to the X-Men.

EDIT: Another approach would be to keep Bobbi and Hunter on Agents of SHIELD and give the Secret Warriors their own show when Season 3 of Agents of SHIELD is over.

It does.  Most people not only consider the gospels true but they consider the gospels ""witness testimony"".  The reality is that the gospels were written by people who never met Jesus, assuming he existed at all.  And you claim that doesn't matter?  It means we have no first hand accounts of the life of Jesus, assuming he even existed.

So Jesus mythicism is actually different from climate change denial: the more you know about the climate, the less you deny climate change; the more you know about the evidence for a historical Jesus (or lack there of), however, the more plausible Jesus mythicism becomes.",2015-08-20 14:34:26+00:00,cu9ht6y,7.0,t1_cu9dnw2,8743.0,DebateReligion

We basically take Paul on his word when he says it happened and even he wasn't an actual witness.

Similarly, there could have been a historical Odin.  In fact, without a historical Odin, it is just a story.

3226,Here's the problem: objectively a moral act is an act that everybody is happy with but happiness is a subjective reaction.  You'd be surprised what makes people unhappy.  Does this make an otherwise moral act immoral?  That's the crux of the problem: I would say that an otherwise moral act is nor rendered immoral just because somebody is unhappy with it; the act has to actually cause them harm.  A victimless act is therefore always a moral one.  There's still a bit of ambiguity there though: if you play your music loud at 11:00 pm you might think it is okay but your neighbors might not be able to sleep and this can actually cause them harm over time.  It's not that cut and dried: being moral requires a degree of empathy for others.

OP said ""I personally find it difficult wrapping my head the notion that everything is fundamentally accidental"" and evolution is an example of a something that does have a guiding principle (namely natural selection) which isn't supernatural so it is very much on topic.",2015-08-13 07:07:02+00:00,cu1cnic,5.0,t1_cu1c0z8,1996.0,DebateAnAtheist
3285,"Thing is, if there were a rational guide to the universe then the universe would be a lot different than it is: we would all have free internet even before computers were invented (because God in his infinite wisdom would have known that we would want computers someday and would have provided us with what we wanted ta da!), we all would have all the food we needed and our food would not go bad if we didn't eat it right away, there would be no diseases like AIDS or cancer or acne or athlete's foot and nobody would ever get an unwanted pregnancy ever and people who wanted to get pregnant would get pregnant right away and would carry the baby to full term without any birth defects ever.  But strangely enough the world is not like this: oddly enough the world is exactly how you would expect it to be if a rational all powerful guide never existed.",2015-08-13 06:56:14+00:00,cu1cga9,3.0,t1_cu1ajeb,5499.0,DebateAnAtheist
3286,"But things are not random.

Evolution is governed by natural selection.  This is not random.  If it were then we would have people with three arms, one arm and no arms.  But people with no arms or even just one arm have a selective disadvantage.  Natural selection guarantees that the species that survive are the ones best adapted to the environment.  That is not random.

Astrophysics is governed by the four forces including gravity, electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces.  Gravity and electromagnetism cause clouds of dust to collect into stars and the nuclear forces both produce light and result in the synthesis of all the elements known to man.  Without these forces, particles truly would move around at random and we wouldn't have stars, planets, animals or people.

Personally, I see it the other way: if there really is a rational being who created the universe then why does the universe seem so irrational?  Why is it that in a (supposedly) infinitely large universe we only know of people existing on a single planet around a single star in a single galaxy?  As Douglas Adams said (paraphrased) if there are a finite number of people in an infinitely large universe then the average population density of the universe is zero and any people you think you see must be figments of your imagination.",2015-08-13 06:45:18+00:00,cu1c91d,3.0,t1_cu19yg2,6284.0,DebateAnAtheist

3376,"&gt; Logical and mathematical truths (ie. there are no married bachelors), 

I'm not sure what your question is here.  Do you mean ""There are no married bachelors therefore God""?  A statement cannot be simultaneously true and false and it cannot contradict itself.  Otherwise everything is fair game and we use empirical science to determine what is true and what is false.

&gt; metaphysical truths (ie. that the world was not created five minutes ago then given the appearance of age),

How do we know the world was not created five minutes ago?  It is because such an assumption would require a creator and it would imply that everything was created (including our memories) as is so as to trick us into believing that the universe had existed 13.7 billion years.  This is all a bit too much to accept so we accept instead the world we observe empirically.

&gt; moral facts (such as unnecessary killing being wrong),

There is no such thing as ""moral facts"" that don't reduce to ""logical truths"".  For example, killing another human being is either right or wrong.  Now, if we were all to kill one other person then the world population would reduce by 50% and there would be a lot of sad people who would have lost husbands and wives and mothers and fathers and sons and daughters.  If we accept that people being sad is not good then killing people has to be considered a bad thing and is therefore wrong.  The wrongness of killing could therefore be observed empirically although the above thought experiment should suffice.

&gt; aesthetic judgements,

Again, we can empirically observe that different people have different aesthetic taste.  We can also account for a lot of what people consider ""aesthetics"".  For example, straight men like large breasts and wide hips because it is a sign that a woman has reached sexual maturity; they like a thin waist because it is a sign that the woman is physically fit.  Facial symmetry is also a sign of good health and good grooming and possibly good genes.  You can compare supermodels, movie stars and beauty queens with ordinary people and empirically show what features people generally prefer.

&gt; and scientific assumptions like the uniformity of natural laws?

Do you realize that even mathematics makes certain assumptions?  For example, parallel lines can be defined as lines which make the same angle with a line that crosses both of them.  We assume that parallel lines never cross but we cannot show this empirically.  There are a lot of things that cannot be shown empirically that need to be assumed so that we have a logical starting point.  There's a certain theorem called the ""incompleteness theorem"" that states that every time we introduce a new branch of mathematics we need to make new assumptions and that therefore no finite number of assumptions would be able to describe all of mathematics, let alone the entire universe.  The key is to make assumptions that seem so intuitively obvious that we don't even realize that we made an assumption.",2015-07-31 10:03:27+00:00,ctmmgro,1.0,t3_3f9eof,12439.0,DebateReligion
3377,"I think they haven't decided yet.  We will probably get a Daredevil Season 3 before The Defenders.  The Defenders series will probably follow directly from the Iron Fist series as that will probably be the last thing shot and released before The Defenders comes out.  My guess is that Marvel is considering the following release schedule.

2015 Daredevil Season 1  Jessica Jones

2016 Daredevil Season 2  Luke Cage

2017 Daredevil Season 3  Iron Fist

2018 The Defenders Season 1  The Punisher

2019 Daredevil Season 4  Heroes For Hire Season 1

So the question is who Iron Fist will be facing in his series.  I suspect that Iron Fist will end in a cliffhanger with some big bad from K'un L'un showing up that Iron Fist won't be able to take on by himself.  The Kingpin, the Hand, the Purple Man and even The Punisher could be thrown in for good measure.  We may even have Blade show up: it would be refreshing to see him villains who aren't vampires.  A Blade series in 2020 would be nice.  It really depends on whether they have enough stories to tell.  Has anybody seen the Blade TV series from 2005 that was written by  Geoff Johns &amp; David S.

3381,"Let me know if this would be okay for Seasons 2 and 3.

Episode 1: Daredevil helps Gladiator protect Betsy from Kingpin's thugs; meanwhie, Punisher gets an origin.

Episode 2: Stick returns and Daredevil is drawn into the fight between the Hand and the Chaste; Punisher subplot advanced; Elektra appears at the end.

Episode 3: Flashback to when Matt first met Elektra; Elektra's story is told from her point of view; episode ends at the same point as previous episode.

Episode 4: Elektra and Daredevil fight; Daredevil limps away and confesses to Claire about her; news report on the TV talks about the Punisher; Daredevil dons his costume again; Claire asks him if the Punisher isn't just doing what he was considering doing to Fisk; Daredevil says ""The difference is that I didn't kill Fisk"". He leaves. Meanwhile, Owlsley's son is introduced as the new crime boss replacing the Kingpin. Underlings report about how the Punisher is killing their men. There is also a report about Stick, Daredevil and Elektra making trouble with their Hand allies. Owlsley asks for recommendations and he is handed a file that has the word ""Bullseye"" on it.

Episode 5: Episode begins with Daredevil and Bullseye fighting. Flashbacks tell the origin of Bullseye. More of the Daredevil and Bullseye fight. Now flashbacks show Bullseye getting recruited by Owlsley and tracking down Daredevil, leading to the fight that gets shown again but with different camera angles. Bullseye ends up being badly injured and turned over to the police.

Episode 6: Daredevil tracks down Elektra. They talk. She tells him about what happened to her after they broke up in law school. They make PG-13 love. The next morning they argue. Matt leaves. He tells her that if she changes her mind about what she's doing then she knows where to find him. Matt goes back to his apartment and Stick is there.

Episode 7: Stick has shown up at Matt's apartment and Stick tells him that there is a new threat that he wants Matt's help with: Vampires. Matt is skeptical but then Stick takes him to a night club and Stick tells him to listen carefully to people's heartbeats. He notices that nobody there has a heartbeat. Stick tells Matt they have to leave because there are too many of them. Stick tells Matt that he knows a guy who is an expert at killing vampires. Matt and Stick have a moral disagreement over whether it is already to kill someone who is arguably already dead. Stick tells Matt he is disappointed that Matt has never learned to do ""what is necessary"". Meanwhile, Bullseye is recovering in hospital.

Episode 8: Daredevil finally tracks down the Punisher. They fight. Daredevil is gravely wounded. The Punisher picks him up and tells him that he will bring him to a hospital. Daredevil tells him ""No"" and gives him Claire's address. The Punisher brings Daredevil to Claire and she nurses him back to health again. Claire and the Punisher discuss the right and wrong of killing criminals. Meanwhile, Bullseye escapes from police custody.

Episode 9: Punisher episode with the Punisher going up against Owlsley but Bullseye shows up and the Punisher is gravely wounded in a fight with Bullseye. The Punisher escapes and goes to Claire's apartment. Claire fixes him up but as the Punisher is leaving the police show up to arrest the Punisher because Claire had dropped a dime on him. The episode ends with the Punisher writing in his war journal about everything that went down. During the episode we also see Matt interacting with Foggy and Karen: we have seen glimpses of Foggy and Karen in previous episodes but now we have a subplot with Matt injured and trying to explain it to Karen.

Episode 10: Elektra episode with Elektra battling the Hand. Things start to heat up between Matt and Karen and Matt wonders if he should tell Karen that he is Daredevil. He asks Foggy for advice and then realizes that Foggy has feelings for Karen. Foggy gets angry with Matt saying that it has always been like this with the girls always falling for Matt and ignoring Foggy. Episode ends with a fight between Bullseye and Elektra: Elektra is gravely wounded and left for dead by Bullseye.

Episode 11: Elektra is brought to a hospital. Stick finds out about what happened to her and has the Chaste kidnap her from the hospital. Barely alive, she is revived by Stick's apparent boss Stone. Meanwhile, Matt tells Karen that he is actually Daredevil. He explains to her that they can't be together because who he is makes her a danger to her and he doesn't want to risk her getting hurt. He considers telling Karen how Foggy feels but he figures that Foggy should be the one to tell her. We also get a teaser of Owlsley going to see Gladiator and asking him to make a suit for him.

Episode 12: Owlsley becomes the Owl. He fights Punisher. Owlsley dies. Meanwhile, Daredevil, Elektra, Stick and Stone fight the Hand. In the end, Gladiator dons his costume.

Episode 13: The Punisher shows up at the Gladiator's workshop. They fight. Daredevil shows up and brings the Punisher down. Elektra meanwhile goes after Bullseye and they have a rematch. Elektra is going to kill Bullseye but she knows that if she does then she will be giving up what she has with Matt. She spares his life and turns him over to the police. Punisher also goes to jail. The series ends with Matt, Elektra, Foggy and Karen hanging out together. No more secrets. Well, except for Karen's mysterious past. :)

Next season should deal with Blade and vampires and Karen's mysterious past. Oh and Kingpin gets out of jail. And Vanessa returns. What kind of revenge does Kingpin have planned against our heroes? Keep in mind that Kingpin doesn't have to learn that Matt Murdock is Daredevil: he knows that Matt and Foggy were the lawyers that put him in jail so he will do whatever he can to discredit Matt and Foggy and have them disbarred.

Special guest star: Iron Fist. Danny Rand is the head of Rand Corporation and he will have a team of lawyers who will prove that Matt and Foggy are innocent of any wrongdoing. In the end, Danny can join Daredevil, Blade and Elektra in fighting hordes of vampires.

Meanwhile, the Punisher meets Bullseye in prison and they fight. The Punisher kills several people in prison before they put him in solitary. The Punisher finds a way to escape prison.

Don't forget though, that Days of Future Past and Apocalypse will have introduced (or re-introduced) a lot of characters: Storm, Cyclops, Jean, Jubilee, Psylocke, Angel, Nightcrawler and Quicksilver.  Both Bryan Singer and the writer of Apocalyse have talked about plans for another X-Men movie.  There could also be an X-Men TV show.  

There could even be an X-Men / Avengers movie: a lot is riding on the success of the Fantastic Four.  If, for example, the Fantastic Four movie is a flop then Fox could do what Sony did with Spider-Man and have Marvel participate in the making of another reboot of the franchise.  That could then lead to Fantastic Four characters appearing in Marvel movies.  This could eventually lead to an X-Men / Avengers movie under the same deal, for example with Bryan Singer directing and Lauren Donner and Kevin Feige as co-producers.

3432,"I think season 2 will be more episodic than season 1.

Episode 1: Daredevil helps Gladiator protect Betsy from Kingpin's thugs; meanwhie, Punisher gets an origin.

Episode 2: Stick returns and Daredevil is drawn into the fight between the Hand and the Chaste; Punisher subplot advanced; Elektra appears at the end.

Episode 3: Flashback to when Matt first met Elektra; Elektra's story is told from her point of view; episode ends at the same point as previous episode.

Episode 4: Elektra and Daredevil fight; Daredevil limps away and confesses to Claire about her; news report on the TV talks about the Punisher; Daredevil dons his costume again; Claire asks him if the Punisher isn't just doing what he was considering doing to Fisk; Daredevil says ""The difference is that I didn't kill Fisk"". He leaves. Meanwhile, Owlsley's son is introduced as the new crime boss replacing the Kingpin. Underlings report about how the Punisher is killing their men. There is also a report about Stick, Daredevil and Elektra making trouble with their Hand allies. Owlsley asks for recommendations and he is handed a file that has the word ""Bullseye"" on it.

Episode 5: Episode begins with Daredevil and Bullseye fighting. Flashbacks tell the origin of Bullseye. More of the Daredevil and Bullseye fight. Now flashbacks show Bullseye getting recruited by Owlsley and tracking down Daredevil, leading to the fight that gets shown again but with different camera angles. Bullseye ends up being badly injured and turned over to the police.

Episode 6: Daredevil tracks down Elektra. They talk. She tells him about what happened to her after they broke up in law school. They make PG-13 love. The next morning they argue. Matt leaves. He tells her that if she changes her mind about what she's doing then she knows where to find him. Matt goes back to his apartment and Stick is there.

Episode 7: Stick has shown up at Matt's apartment and Stick tells him that there is a new threat that he wants Matt's help with: Vampires. Matt is skeptical but then Stick takes him to a night club and Stick tells him to listen carefully to people's heartbeats. He notices that nobody there has a heartbeat. Stick tells Matt they have to leave because there are too many of them. Stick tells Matt that he knows a guy who is an expert at killing vampires. Matt and Stick have a moral disagreement over whether it is already to kill someone who is arguably already dead. Stick tells Matt he is disappointed that Matt has never learned to do ""what is necessary"". Meanwhile, Bullseye is recovering in hospital.

Episode 8: Daredevil finally tracks down the Punisher. They fight. Daredevil is morally wounded. The Punisher picks him up and tells him that he will bring him to a hospital. Daredevil tells him ""No"" and gives him Claire's address. The Punisher brings Daredevil to Claire and she nurses him back to health again. Claire and the Punisher discuss the right and wrong of killing criminals. Meanwhile, Bullseye escapes from police custody.

Episode 9: Punisher episode with the Punisher going up against Owlsley but Bullseye shows up and the Punisher is mortally wounded in a fight with Bullseye. The Punisher escapes and goes to Claire's apartment. Claire fixes him up but as the Punisher is leaving the police show up to arrest the Punisher because Claire had dropped a dime on him. The episode ends with the Punisher writing in his war journal about everything that went down. During the episode we also see Matt interacting with Foggy and Karen: we have seen glimpses of Foggy and Karen in previous episodes but now we have a subplot with Matt injured and trying to explain it to Karen.

Episode 10: Elektra episode with Elektra battling the Hand. Things start to heat up between Matt and Karen and Matt wonders if he should tell Karen that he is Daredevil. He asks Foggy for advice and then realizes that Foggy has feelings for Karen. Foggy gets angry with Matt saying that it has always been like this with the girls always falling for Matt and ignoring Foggy. Episode ends with a fight between Bullseye and Elektra: Elektra is mortally wounded and left for dead by Bullseye.  

Episode 11: Elektra is brought to a hospital. Stick finds out about what happened to her and has the Chaste kidnap her from the hospital. Barely alive, she is revived by Stick's apparent boss Stone. Meanwhile, Matt tells Karen that he is actually Daredevil. He explains to her that they can't be together because who he is makes her a danger to her and he doesn't want to risk her getting hurt. He considers telling Karen how Foggy feels but he figures that Foggy should be the one to tell her.  We also get a teaser of Owlsley going to see Gladiator and asking him to make a suit for him.

Episode 12: Owlsley becomes the Owl. He fights Punisher. Owlsley dies. Meanwhile, Daredevil, Elektra, Stick and Stone fight the Hand. In the end, Gladiator dons his costume.

Episode 13: The Punisher shows up at the Gladiator's workshop. They fight. Daredevil shows up and brings the Punisher down. Elektra meanwhile goes after Bullseye and they have a rematch. Elektra is going to kill Bullseye but she knows that if she does then she will be giving up what she has with Matt. She spares his life and turns him over to the police.  Punisher also goes to jail.  The series ends with Matt, Elektra, Foggy and Karen hanging out together. No more secrets. Well, except for Karen's mysterious past. :)

Next season should deal with Blade and vampires and Karen's mysterious past. Oh and Kingpin gets out of jail. And Vanessa returns. What kind of revenge does Kingpin have planned against our heroes? Keep in mind that Kingpin doesn't have to learn that Matt Murdock is Daredevil: he knows that Matt and Foggy were the lawyers that put him in jail so he will do whatever he can to discredit Matt and Foggy and have them disbarred. 

Special guest star: Iron Fist. Danny Rand is the head of Rand Corporation and he will have a team of lawyers who will prove that Matt and Foggy are innocent of any wrongdoing. In the end, Danny can join Daredevil, Blade and Elektra in fighting hordes of vampires.  

Meanwhile, the Punisher meets Bullseye in prison and they fight.  The Punisher kills several people in prison before they put him in solitary.  The Punisher finds a way to escape prison.

Biology tells us a different story.

Bullshit.  You are either deliberately lying or you have no idea what you are talking about.

""This paper suggests that medically the term a 'human being' should be defined by the presence of an active human brain. The brain is the only unique and irreplaceable organ in the human body, as the orchestrator of all organ systems and the seat of personality. Thus, the presence or absence of brain life truly defines the presence or absence of human life in the medical sense. When viewed in this way, human life may be seen as a continuous spectrum between the onset of brain life in utero (eight weeks gestation), until the occurrence of brain death. At any point human tissue or organ systems may be present, but without the presence of a functional human brain, these do not constitute a 'human being', at least in a medical sense. ""

&gt; How is that? Since you are very much for uncaused things.

If a rock were to fly up in the air, the rock itself would not be a cause.  You admitted already that (because the rock is not a quantum particle) there would have to be an external cause.

&gt; Why would not a well organized uncaused nucleus decays somehow cause certain reactions which would make the rock fly?

Seriously?  This is called ""grasping at straws"".

&gt; And why would not it fly in any case, since causality is not necessary?

The rock is not a quantum particle.

&gt; Voila, two questions for you.

Unlike you, I actually answer questions.

&gt;&gt; Quantum processes are well understood.

&gt; Can you answer my question?

How is this not an answer to your question?  We understand precisely about causal loops in quantum mechanics.

&gt;&gt; See what? A pre-condition is not a cause. Obviously English is not your first language so you don't see this.

&gt; I also doubt the same for you: A pre-condition is a condition. Does this require explanation?

""Doubt the same for you""?  What kind of English is this?  Admit it: you speak Arabic at home, right?

In any case, a condition is not a cause.  This has been established in this exchange already.  Please pay attention.

&gt; Condition: something essential to the appearance or occurrence of something else (merriam.com)
&gt; It is something necessary for something to happen.

Conditions are not causes.  This was established with the thought experiment involving the flying rock.

&gt; A question of English: Cite situations where a condition is not a cause.

A condition NEVER is a cause, you idiot.  Conditions exist before and after something happens but they are not the causes for the events to occur.

&gt;&gt; And fantasy does not become real by calling it real.

&gt; You have the tendency of calling names without giving reasons.

I have backed up all my statements with facts, you idiot.  You have not backed up your assertions with anything.

Seriously.

&gt; You like arguments from authority, and I think it was you who cares a lot for PhD. But they may be misleading, especially if one does not use reason.

If I say that religion is a ""juvenile fantasy"" is it not significant that the father of psychoanalysis agreed with me?

&gt;&gt;  As usual, you refuse to address the question I ask.

&gt; I answered it in another part, nevertheless, I paste it again. (You mean your question about positrons I assume, otherwise let me know) :

&gt; If empty space is not nothingness, then these pairs do not come from nothingness. Do not be mislead by the concept out of existence. This existence is what our tools do not have access yet. So out of existence is not nothingness. And you probably heard of fluctuations in the vacuum. So, you may try to search a little bit to find out that vacuum has inside events going on. So there is no reason at all to think that they are not caused. With even a slight background on quantum physics,

I have a PhD in quantum physics, you idiot.

&gt; you will understand easily what I mean. On the other hand, please also consider the point in the link in OP. A positron has a relationship with its environment, space and so on. Thus, if you consider that in that respect, you will understand that it is passive and needs SSC. Its location, its size, its energy and so on relate to other things. But the other things also relate to the positron. Thus, the circularity within this whole will show you that they need the One SSC. Therefore, it is caused in any case.

Nope, you didn't answer my questions.  What causes photon decay? What causes a nucleus to decay?

&gt;&gt; Rocks don't spontaneously fly into the sky but quantum mechanical processes do spontaneously occur.

&gt; And we have access to the quantas as we have access to the rocks? Rocks cannot fly without cause, but quantas can?

The word quanta is the plural of quantum.  Do you even know what the word means?  In any case, quantum particles have a wave nature and they are able to exist for temporary time periods.  Such particles are called ""virtual"".

&gt;&gt; It is the heart of the problem. Your entire argument is ""We know God exists so therefore he exists.""

&gt; You may love behaving based on tautology. But I do not.

And yet this is how you argue: you assert your assertions to be true simply because you believe them to be true.

&gt;&gt; And, yet again, you refuse to answer the question. The answer is either ""Yes"" or ""No"".

&gt; You make a mistake here. Suppose that there is a benevolent person. But he is punishing because of a real crime.

So why do children die from cancer?

&gt; When he punishes, he is being both benevolent (for the society for example), and both harsh (for the criminal). So this is not a yes or no question.

Again, is your god being benevolent when he makes people weep?  Yes or no?

&gt;&gt; So if a child died of cancer, was your god punishing him?
&gt; No, He is taking back what He gives. And there may be many other consequences.

Again, ""what about war, sickness, hunger and death? Are these things considered evidence of benevolence?""

This does not address the fact that electron positron pairs spontaneously pop in and out of existence.

Freud considered theism to be a mental illness.  Seriously.

&gt;&gt; The rock would not be a cause. It would be a pre-condition. The force of gravity acting on the rock would be the cause. Now, what causes photon decay? What causes a nucleus to decay?

&gt;&gt; Exactly. It would have to be a miracle.

Rocks don't spontaneously fly into the sky but quantum mechanical processes do spontaneously occur.

3472,"&gt;&gt; One does not need to identify a cause for the big bang. We say that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago but this would seem to imply that there was a time when the universe did not exist. This may not be true: time slows down when you are in a strong gravitational field and when the universe was young the matter density of the universe was much higher than it was today. As you go back further in time the matter density becomes greater and greater until at t=0 the matter density would be infinite and time would stop. Of course, as the universe becomes denser and denser time slows down more and more and you would never reach a time t=0. Stephen Hawking made this argument to explain why we can not actually detect the exact moment when the universe began and he argued that if there is no moment of creation then there is no need for a creator. Alternatively you could argue that the big bang caused itself as there are plenty of examples in particle physics of the conditions necessary for an event to occur being established after the event occurred.

&gt; Your comment relates to a first mover argument. But note that I said ""but not limited to before the big bang.""

Time would slow down or accelerate according to what? Same would apply for space. And they would extend or shorten according to each other? Then their relative change would happen within what? Within meta spacetime?

Another of Stephen Hawking's arguments dates back to his book A Brief History of Time.  He argued that when you go back in time entropy becomes less and less but as entropy cannot be zero (as this would imply a perfectly uniform and thus effectively empty universe) it is a similar argument that you don't actually have a time t=0.

Stephen Hawking made this argument to explain why we can not actually detect the exact moment when the universe began and he argued that if there is no moment of creation then there is no need for a creator. 

Alternatively you could argue that the big bang caused itself as there are plenty of examples in particle physics of the conditions necessary for an event to occur being established after the event occurred.  ",2015-07-21 00:35:53+00:00,ctacesm,15.0,t1_ct9pz4p,35277.0,DebateAnAtheist
3478,"&gt; I would never describe anything in this context as ""an uncaused cause."" Either the matter in the universe has always existed, or it was preceded by something else that may have always existed.

There's a third possibility.  We say that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago but this would seem to imply that there was a time when the universe did not exist.  This may not be true: time slows down when you are in a strong gravitational field and when the universe was young the matter density of the universe was much higher than it was today.  As you go back further in time the matter density becomes greater and greater until at t=0 the matter density would be infinite and time would stop.  Of course, as the universe becomes denser and denser time slows down more and more and you would never reach a time t=0.

3482,"&gt;&gt; No, I am simply diagnosing your mental illness.

&gt; Such comments are irrelevant with the topic.

On the contrary, I am addressing the problem here head on.

&gt;&gt; No, you said that empty space has particles that pop in and out of existance BUT YOU DID NOT SAY WHY THIS OCCURS.

&gt; So there are particles in any case. Without the particles, we cannot speak of moving particles. Thus, there is at least one cause.

I am talking about particles popping ""in and out of existence"" and not just moving around. 

&gt;&gt; Their appearance and disappearance has no external cause.

&gt; Did I say there can be only external cause?

An internal cause would be a causal loop.  Are you open to the idea that the universe caused itself and that there was no need for your completely imaginary god?

&gt;&gt; See what I posted a few minutes ago.

&gt; There is nothing noteworthy.

Only a complete refutation of your entire argument. 

&gt;&gt; Your argument is that if particles pop in and out of existence then this causes particles to pop in and out of existence. It is a circular argument.

&gt; If a rock falls and its mass has a share in its fall, is this circular? By the way, popping into existence is just a part of a quote that is just to show that there are particles anyway.

No, that's not what it means at all.  Do you not speak English?

&gt; Otherwise, into and out of existence is not something I agree with,

Well, too bad.  It is a well understood process.

&gt; except if we take the word existence as things that we can observe with our current tools.

That is precisely what physicists do.

&gt;&gt; Nothing causes a photon to decay. Nothing causes a nucleus to decay.

&gt; You look like a person who is for god of gaps argument.

Ad hominem.  I in no way look like a theist.  Theists are complete morons and I strongly resent you comparing me to theist morons.

&gt; Atheists say against this, that everything has a cause and science will fill all the gaps.

There are some things that do not have causes but we do not have to explain them using your imaginary god.  The processes I am talking about are well studied, well understood processes. 

&gt; But you say the opposite. And most atheists would say that there are causes to decay and so on,

No, they would not.  Every single person here has been giving these as examples of uncaused events.  Pay attention.

&gt; and even if we did not discover, they will be discovered with the improvements in our tools.

They are well studied, well understood processes.

&gt; Maybe you are trolling.

This is ""DebateanAtheist"" and not ""IgnoreanAtheist"".  You are the one who has been trolling here.

&gt;&gt; I have arguments that you still haven't responded to. You have assertions that have been disproven.

&gt; You have not come with any noteworthy counter argument.

All I have done is completely refute your assertions.  You never presented an argument to support your assertions and you still haven't, not unless you consider ad hominems to be an argument.

&gt;&gt; No, it does not. It rotates as a result of angular momentum.

&gt; And you think that the momentum does not relate to the earth, it is totally isolated from it.

&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't. It shines as a result of nuclear fusion.

&gt; Same with the above.

I reiterate that pre-conditions are not causes.

&gt;&gt; Can you look at the things you write and still consider yourself mentally competent?

&gt; Irrelevant. Indication that you have no counter argument.

Your inability to form or even understand a coherent argument is very relevant here.

&gt;&gt; No, free will is an illusion. You don't beleve in free will either if you believe your god is all powerful and can predict all. Even if you believe that nothing happens without a cause then you wouldn't have free will because your actions would be predictable.

&gt; I explained already. Your comment lacks content.

You have never explained anything.  I don't even think you speak proper English.

&gt;&gt; How does your Quran define benevolence? Is the world that exists consistent with an all powerful god that is benevolent as the Quran defines benevolence? And if the Quran does not define benevolence, if it is not a source of moral thought, then what good is it?

&gt; I see that you came to a blind alley with your arguments with the topic in OP, so you try some main arguments of atheism. That is fine.
&gt; That you have mouth, that you have ears, ... are all consequence of the benevolence of God. The source of all benefits.

Your god does not even exist.  You cannot point to the existence of the world and claim it is evidence for your god.  That is the flaw of your argument from the beginning.

In any case, why is human suffering then not a result of your god.  Why do you praise your imaginary god for everything that you consider good if you are not going to blame your imaginary god for all things that you consider bad?

&gt;&gt; Is the world that exists consistent with an all powerful god that is benevolent as the Quran defines benevolence?

&gt; The Quran defines the benevolence of Allah based on the benefits in the world: The sun, the moon, the air, the water, our children, our parents, ... All from which we benefit are the outcomes of the benevolence of Allah.

And what about war, sickness, hunger and death?  Are these things considered evidence of benevolence?

&gt;&gt; And if the Quran does not define benevolence, if it is not a source of moral thought, then what good is it?

&gt; It is a source of moral thought, but it is not the only source. All the attributes of SSC are sources of moral thought. Justice, punishment, reward, forgiveness, thankfulness, patience, power, knowledge, love, nearness... It is a much more comprehensive source of moral thought than you may think.

If your Quran has taught you to ignore people and insult them then your Quran has not taught you morality at all.

&gt;&gt; Either he has a cause or he is not real.
&gt;&gt; You cannot make exceptions to your assertion #1 without admitting that assertion #1 is wrong.

&gt; Please read again point 1. I did not say anything like everything needs a cause. Had I said such a thing, you might be right. But I do not assert such a thing.

Read it yourself.  ""1 If there is a reality (reality here does not mean entire existence, it means here a thing which is real) there is cause""

&gt;&gt; You just reassert the same nonsense in a different way.

&gt; Point 1 is a clear point. Why do you find it difficult to accept?

Assertion #1 has been disproven.

&gt; Especially as an atheist, who generally find science value searching the causes of things. I think you contradict yourself, or atheism in general.

No.  Atheists follow evidence.  If the evidence shows that certain things are the result of causal loops and have no external cause then we must accept that.

&gt; Well, considering your prejudices and dislike of religion, should I conclude that you will reject anything I say, even though it complies with some parts of atheism?

Ad hominem.  When are you going to stop insulting people and actually try to offer an argument to support your assertions?

&gt;&gt; For the record, if we assume that the universe has an ultimate cause, there is no reason to assume that it be intelligent or even self aware.

The universe is not a robot.  It is not manufactured.  It is naturally occurring.

3483,"&gt;&gt; You state that a ""precondition is a cause"" but this is not true. Suppose you have a rock on the ground. This is a precondition. Does the rock suddenly fly up into the sky? But the rock exists as a pre-condition. Is this precondition not a cause for the rock to suddenly fly away? Of course not.

&gt; Firstly, your analogy is irrelevant.

Assertion.

&gt; If you gave a realistic example about a rock it would be better to understand. 

Am I not speaking English?

&gt; For example, if you had said that a rock fell from a place, it would be realistic.

If you were to admit that your god were a juvenile fantasy then you would be being realistic.  It is a perfectly good analogy.

&gt; In which case, it would be clear to you that the mass of the rock, the mass of the earth would be the cause (where the rock is also a cause, while also being a condition).

The rock would not be a cause.  It would be a pre-condition.  The force of gravity acting on the rock would be the cause.  Now, what causes photon decay?  What causes a nucleus to decay?

&gt; Secondly, in your unrealistic example also if we question, we will see that even if the rock is a condition, it is also a cause

Nonsense.  I have explained the difference between pre-conditions and causes.  You can have existing conditions and any change that occurs would then presumably have to be explained and the explanation for the change would be a cause.  Thing is, some things really do occur without causes: I have given three examples and you have never been able to refuted them

&gt; Imagine that it moved as you said. Now, is the total energy is higher or lower than when it was still? If it is higher, this means either the energy came from the atoms of the rock, or it came from its outside. 

Yes.  Exactly.  It would have to be a miracle. 

&gt; Remember the laws of thermodynamics. So if it did not come from its outside, this means that some part of the rock became kinetic energy. 

Spontaneously?  Without any cause whatsoever?

&gt; Or maybe something adjacent to the rock started to move, therefore relatively to that thing, the rock moves: In this situation, of course the initial situation of the rock even if you call it a condition, is a cause for this relative motion. 

No, it clearly isn't, by your own admission above.

&gt; Thus, your examples have nothing to do with any uncaused things. I do not have even any doubt about this.

Perhaps you should read the excellent refute that you provided above against the argument that the rock itself could be considered a cause for it to suddenly jump and fly away. 

&gt;&gt; Neither is the presence of the vacuum or a photon or a nucleus a cause for any of the quantum processes I described. Thus, you have not demonstrated any causes for quantum foam, photon decay or nuclear decay. In fact, all you have done is agree with me that these processes take place without identifying any causes why they take place.

&gt; Same explanation applies for all of these things as well.

Where have you provided any explanation for these processes?  Perhaps you can read up about them and get back to me.

&gt; If you disagree let me know. I also recommend that you try to remember your knowledge about the laws of thermodynamics.

I am talking about quantum mechanics.  Quantum mechanics and classical thermodynamics are two very different things.  Did you not know that?

&gt;&gt; Second, you claim that you ""god can predict all"" but if your god can predict all then there is no such thing as free will because you pre-suppose that your god created the universe and mankind that he intervened occasionally after that. If your god has had any influence at all on mankind and he could ""predict all"" then he would know every action that everybody ever made and it would have been due to his influence so the claim that people have free will would be disproven.

&gt; God knows every action that I do and I will do. This has nothing to do with my free will.

If your actions are 100% predictable then you have no free will.

&gt; You can also know what someone will do under certain conditions. Your knowledge does not make all of these acts dependent on your knowledge. You may know that if you do a favor to one of your friends, he will say thank you. Does this make his thanking outside free will? But if you direct a gun to him and say ""Say thank you! Otherwise..."" in this case, his will is not free. In the first case, he says thank you, and there is no contradiction within him. So, I consider him to have free will. In the second case, he says thank you, but while he moves his tongue to produce these words, in his mind he does not have such an intention. So there is contradiction within him, and he opposes to what he does in fact. Thus, he does not have free will. It is so clear.

Irrelevant.  First of all, I am not claiming to be all powerful let alone the creator of the universe.  Second, if your actions are predictable then you only have the illusion of free will and you only think you are making your own decisions.

&gt;&gt; On top of that we have the claim that your god is both all powerful and benevolent. But a god that can predict all would know the consequences of everything he did and would be careful to ensure that no evil arose from his creation, otherwise he would either be unable to prevent evil from arising (in which case he would not be all powerful) or he would simply not care (in which case he would not be benevolent).

&gt; As I explained in OP, I am not a Christian.

So?  That makes you no less delusional.

&gt; God is Benevolent, but He is also Destroyer. As said in the Quran, ""He is the one who gives life, and He is the one who makes to die."" ""He is the one who makes to laugh, and He is the one who makes to weep"". His Benevolence is such a benevolence by definition. Like it or not.

Then what is the basis for morality in the Quran?  Is your god being benevolent when he makes people weep?

&gt; On the other hand, you can see lots of evil things in this life. But He is able to compensate for any evil, in the hereafter.

Are you saying that your god commits evil acts?

&gt;&gt; Finally, there is the claim that ""all of reality needs a cause"" and you went on to assert that ""all of reality means everything that is real"". So, based on your ""logic"", your god either needs a cause or it is not real. And if you want to make an exception for your god then why can't you make an exception for your god as a whole and leave your imaginary deity out of the argument altogether?

&gt; I did not say ""all of reality needs a cause"". Please read again point 1 in OP.

I'm actually quoting your first assertion.

&gt;&gt; And if you want to make an exception for your god then why can't you make an exception for the universe as a whole and leave your imaginary deity out of the argument altogether?

&gt; Thus, I do not need to do any exception.

According to your first assertion, your god is either unreal or it needs a cause.  If you say that your god is real and has no cause then you are making an exception.

&gt;&gt; All these questions you have refused to answer many times. Rather you have just pretended they were never asked.

&gt;&gt; Think of it this way: if everything happened for a reason then you would not have free will because every single one of your actions would be predictable. This makes your religion somewhat pointless as your god, in particular, would surely be able to predict everything you would do.

&gt; Everything I do is predictable for God. 

Who?  Oh, you mean your imaginary friend.

&gt; But predictability does not abolish free will. 

Of course it does.  Your god is supposed to be omnipotent, remember?

&gt; If you understand free will...

Ad hominem.  Do you have anything else to offer?

&gt; so as it does not have any cause, I think this is wrong.

So?  Your track record at making accurate assertions is poor.

If you do something for a specific reason it is not because you made a conscious choice.  Rather, it is the result of a combination of your beliefs, your perceptions and your memories.  If you believe that a certain action is the action that you should take then that it the action you will take.  This is predictable.

&gt; But for me it is a free will.

It is the illusion of free will.  Look, your assertion #1 is that everything has a cause.  If everything has a cause then your actions are predictable.  You only think you are making conscious decisions.

&gt; But if someone forces me by certain means to make this investment, then this is not free will.

It never is.

&gt; It is very clear.

It is to me.  You are the one who is confused.  Watch the youtube video ""Free Will"" by Harris.  Or read his book.

&gt;&gt; For that matter, if everything has a cause then that would surely include your god. Otherwise, your god would have to be something that exists without cause and your point one would be invalid. And if your god could exist without cause then why not the universe?

&gt; Do you claim empty space is nothingness? As I explained earlier, it is not the case. 

No, you said that empty space has particles that pop in and out of existance BUT YOU DID NOT SAY WHY THIS OCCURS.

&gt;&gt; It is a circular argument to say that the presence of these particles causes these particles to appear.

&gt; Exactly. So something else makes them appear?

""Circular reasoning (Latin: circulus in probando, ""circle in proving""; also known as circular logic) is a logical fallacy in which the reasoner begins with what they are trying to end with.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_argument

Nothing makes them appear.  Their appearance and disappearance has no external cause.  This is well understood by educated people.

&gt; You haven't responded to ANYTHING I have said.

&gt; Such as?

See what I posted a few minutes ago.

&gt;&gt; And what causes them to ""pop into and out of existance"". All you have done is agree with what I have said already. This is progress.

&gt; If you say you discovered that 1+1=8, and I ask you what makes you discover it, I do not mean of course that I agree that 1+1=8.

Your argument is that if particles pop in and out of existance then this causes particles to pop in and out of existance.  It is a circular argument.

&gt;&gt; Imagine there is a rock on the ground. Does it spontaneously fly up into the air? No, because nothing would cause that to happen. But the rock does exist. JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING EXISTS IS NOT A CAUSE FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN TO IT.

&gt; If no rock exists, then no rock will in the air. If it goes up, either it has such a feature to go up, or something else makes it go up. It is not impossible that a thing contains elements that causes it go up.

Nothing causes a photon to decay.  Nothing causes a nucleus to decay.

&gt;&gt; Logic is obviously something you have absolutely no familiarity with. You are a typical theist in that respect. Logical people, by definition, reject theistic nonsense.

&gt; What a prejudice!

I am stating a well known fact.  Welcome to reality.

Perhaps now you will stop insulting people here and saying things like ""What is it that you don't understand?"" and ""I have already explained that."" when people completely refute your assertions.

&gt;&gt; You are a theist so by definition you are mentally incompetent.

&gt; If you had counter arguments,

I have arguments that you still haven't responded to.  You have assertions that have been disproven.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; You can read a dictionary but you can't understand: the photon does not cause itself to decay; the nucleus does not cause itself to decay. These are events that ultimately cause themselves in so far as they occur spontaneously and the necessary conditions for them to occur are established only after they happen.

&gt; So the earth does not cause itself to rotate,

No, it does not.  It rotates as a result of angular momentum.

&gt; the sun does not cause itself to shine,

No, it doesn't.  It shines as a result of nuclear fusion.

&gt;... Even if there was no earth, there would be the rotation of the earth!

Can you look at the things you write and still consider yourself mentally competent?

&gt;&gt; No, it isn't: you have a mental illness that causes you to believe absolute nonsense. If your actions are predictable then this proves you don't have free will.

&gt; Do you believe that you have free will?

No, free will is an illusion.  You don't beleve in free will either if you believe your god is all powerful and can predict all.  Even if you believe that nothing happens without a cause then you wouldn't have free will because your actions would be predictable.

&gt;&gt; Your god doesn't even exist. If your god could predict all then he could prevent evil. If he can't then he is either not all powerful or not benevolent and in either case he would not be the god that your Quran describes. Welcome to the world of logical thinking.
&gt; 
&gt; Does the world of logical thinking require that benevolence be defined as you define?

How does your Quran define benevolence?  Is the world that exists consistent with an all powerful god that is benevolent as the Quran defines benevolence?  And if the Quran does not define benevolence, if it is not a source of moral thought, then what good is it?

&gt;&gt; You said ""If there is a reality (reality here does not mean entire existence, it means here a thing which is real) there is cause"" so by your ""logic"" your god either has a cause or your god isn't real. Which is it?

&gt; He is the cause.

Nonsense.  Either he has a cause or he is not real.  You cannot make exceptions to your assertion #1 without admitting that assertion #1 is wrong.

&gt;&gt; There is NO additional explanation under point one: all you do is reassert the same nonsense all over again.
&gt; 
&gt; There is. Check-it again.

No, there isn't.  You just reassert the same nonsense in a different way.

&gt;&gt; You haven't even come close to answering my question. Is it because you didn't understand it?

&gt; Maybe you can make your question more specific to me.

I'll take that as a ""Yes"".  For the record, if we assume that the universe has an ultimate cause, there is no reason to assume that it be intelligent or even self aware.",2015-07-19 03:53:16+00:00,ct8bxkd,19.0,t1_ct8bgwy,1087.0,DebateAnAtheist
3493,"
&gt;&gt; I read and read but didnt see any good refutation of uncaused things in this thread. 

&gt; It is refuted.

This is an assertion.  You still haven't answered any of my questions.

You state that a ""precondition is a cause"" but this is not true.  Suppose you have a rock on the ground.  This is a precondition.  Does the rock suddenly fly up into the sky?  But the rock exists as a pre-condition.  Is this precondition not a cause for the rock to suddenly fly away?  Of course not.  Neither is the presence of the vacuum or a photon or a nucleus a cause for any of the quantum processes I described.  Thus, you have not demonstrated any casuses for quantum foam, photon decay or nuclear decay.  In fact, all you have done is agree with me that these processes take place without identifying any causes why they take place.

Second, you claim that you ""god can predict all"" but if your god can predict all then there is no such thing as free will because you pre-suppose that your god created the universe and mankind that he intervened occasionally after that.  If your god has had any influence at all on mankind and he could ""predict all"" then he would know every action that everybody ever made and it would have been due to his influence so the claim that people have free will would be disproven.

On top of that we have the claim that your god is both all powerful and benevolent.  But a god that can predict all would know the consequences of everything he did and would be careful to ensure that no evil arose from his creation, otherwise he would either be unable to prevent evil from arising (in which case he would not be all powerful) or he would simply not care (in which case he would not be benevolent).

Finally, there is the claim that ""all of reality needs a cause"" and you went on to assert that ""all of reality means everything that is real"".  So, based on your ""logic"", your god either needs a cause or it is not real.  And if you want to make an exception for your god then why can't you make an exception for your god as a whole and leave your imaginary deity out of the argument altogether?

&gt; Does it happen if there is no photon? It is clearly a cause. Conditions are also causes,

No, they are not. Imagine there is a rock on the ground. Does it spontaneously fly up into the air? No, because nothing would cause that to happen. But the rock does exist.

3544,"&gt; Can you give one example where there is no cause?

1) Vacuum fluctuations have no cause: electrons and positrons come into existence in the background and annihilate each other and they can only be detected by the effect of their charges on other particles.  No creator is required to bring them into existence.

2) Photon decay.  When an x-ray photon decays into an electron positron pair, it can only do so in the presence of an atomic nucleus.  However, the atomic nucleus does not ""cause"" the photon to decay.  Rather it accepts some of the momentum of the decay products after the fact.  

3) Nuclear decay.  We can predict how many nuclei will decay over a given period of time but we cannot predict when a nucleus will decay.  There is, apparently, nothing that causes nuclear decay to occur.  It appears to happen at random and yet we can detect when it occurs.

3549,"""This paper suggests that medically the term a 'human being' should be defined by the presence of an active human brain. The brain is the only unique and irreplaceable organ in the human body, as the orchestrator of all organ systems and the seat of personality. Thus, the presence or absence of brain life truly defines the presence or absence of human life in the medical sense. When viewed in this way, human life may be seen as a continuous spectrum between the onset of brain life in utero (eight weeks gestation), until the occurrence of brain death. At any point human tissue or organ systems may be present, but without the presence of a functional human brain, these do not constitute a 'human being', at least in a medical sense. ""
