I find my players running ( with a sudden speed) far of the man or ball when i shift around quickly in the box ( defending). they make tackles out in the air and more often than not run too much away from what logic would suggest. Is this purely my input error, or does it help to switch the ""continue run"" option completely off?
basicly i want to defend slow driblers making a diagonal pass in the box.
