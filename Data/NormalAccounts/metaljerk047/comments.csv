Run it with lightcrossbow, he pistol crossbow, switchblade and rouge, light crossbow can one shot body shot everything, i like to run with concussion grenade useful for getting out of sticky situations, 3x bigger radius then grenades stuns for a few seconds and decreases enemys accuracy by about 50% for a while, want to use suit as at our is kind of useless In one down, and it has highest dodge chance, when u go into swansong make sure there's at least one cop near u (preferably 1 cop) if you don't get instantly revived within the first two seconds and there's no ai or real people near u shoot that cop and press spacebar, press spacebar when there isn't much time left on your custody counter unless u are needed elsewhere, u have your doc bags to replenish your messiah charges, think that's all the tips I can give u about this build
