The problem here is not that he helped the wounded..but does that absolve him of havin worked for a terrorist organisation?? ",2015-07-25 21:35:34+00:00,ctg1uml,2,t1_ctg1psq,262,worldnews
15,"There seems to be several accounts on how really Muhammad Suleiman die

&gt; A [Time](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1830018,00.html) report said in 2008 - Brigadier General Mohammed Suleiman, 49, was shot dead last Friday at his chalet in the Rimal al-Zahabieh luxury resort nine miles north of the port city of Tartous on the Mediterranean. Some analysts, however, suspect that the killer fired from close range â€” they note the fact that Suleiman was hit in the head, neck and stomach, and also the difficulty of firing that accurately from a bobbing boat.

Iranian media claimed that Suleiman was shot by a silenced weapon in the head and neck on a beach at al Rimal al Zahabiyeh resort near Tartous on 1 August 2008.

Another claimed a Mossad spy Ali Jarrah ""testified to have scouted 'certain points' in the coastal town of Tartous in northern Syria,"" where Suleiman was assassinated.

France said that Suleiman was not killed by a sniper, but in fact gunned down in his car.

There also have been report that claimed that taking such close shot from a boat was quite difficult",2015-07-15 17:14:23+00:00,ct4c58y,2,t1_ct4a1q5,3118,worldnews
