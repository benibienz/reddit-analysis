It's especially noticeable to my wife, because I will sometimes pair color shades that have no business being together. I ask her frequently if certain colors work together.

I can rarely make out red laser pointers on lit screens or black backdrops. It just blends right in for me... put it on a white wall and I have no problem though.

49,"&gt; I'm curious if you believe Jesus really existed?

Absolutely, Jesus existed. There were a lot of Jesus' at that time period. Many people at the time shared that name, as it was a pretty popular name among the Jews of the time. So, therefore, there was a Jesus who existed... there were lots of them. There's even a decent chance that some cult leader of the time was named Jesus, and that his version of Judaism grew in popularity until it became Christianity (much like Joseph Smith's version of Christianity has become a large movement: the Latter Day Saints.)

The Jesus as depicted in the Bible? No. That guy didn't exist. Someone who can feed thousands of people out of a simple basket of food, who can walk on water, who can raise the dead, and who is attributable to a host of other miracles? That's someone who is going to get people talking, and who is going to very quickly get governmental notice. Government notice means official records and documents, of which there are none. We only have accounts of that guy from the Gospels, from Christian apologia, and from third-party writers whose authenticity is in quite a bit of dispute, none of which can be relied on for objective evidence by their very nature.

Personally, I think Jesus was a guy who managed to create a sect of Judaism (a cult). He managed to gain followers, probably had a few run-ins with the religious leaders of his day (as a cult leader would), was localized to a small area of Israel (Galilee and Judea), was probably executed (open heresy was a crime that got you killed back then), and his followers dispersed and carried their beliefs out farther. Given the social climate at the time, the ground was fertile for those seeds to grow and bear fruit; eventually we see the beginnings of Christianity, which morphs into the beast we know today. We see something similar throughout history with charismatic religious leaders: Buddha, the Maccabees, Luther, Calvin, Smith... all of these leaders (the Maccabees were a group of leaders) became major movements and denominations.",2016-11-02 14:01:36+00:00,d9ic52r,1.0,t3_5apc1k,9262.0,exjw

My FSD comes after this. Other modules follow, if I've still got the room for outfitting.

If I'm planning on cargo or exploration, I'd probably follow the same general methods above, but I'd most likely choose different classes. A-rated power plant, distributer, and thrusters, and D-rated everything else that qualifies (for saving mass/extending jump ranges.) I *might* decide on D-rated power plant, distributer, and thrusters if mass is an issue, but I like to go fast and be able to boost quickly from danger when interdicted if I'm running a cargo/explorer setup. Modules will vary depending on purpose: cargo holds for a transport, explore-y stuff for exploration.

I haven't done any passenger stuff yet, so I know nothing about any of that.

The nice thing about the Cobra is that it's a decent multi-role ship. Something like the Vipers really only excel in one area; the Cobra can muddle around in most things (though it also doesn't excel at any particular one.)

Whoops. Sorry about the digression into 80's era sitcom theme songs.

When we were JW's, we had to invent a mythology about the rest of humanity in order to set us apart from them. There had to be a reason we were better... so it must mean that worldly people are wicked, evil, and prone to looking for ways to harm you and take advantage of others. This is, of course, the basic formula that cults use to control their members: set them apart, make them feel as though they are superior to the rest of humanity and that the rest of humanity is jealous and angry at them because of that superiority, and you can control them better.

I've seen people throughout the world who are amazing and awesome. I've seen people do things that very few others, including JW's, would do. Likewise, I've seen JW's do some amazing things as well. And we all know that we can also find plenty of examples of the opposite in both camps. People are simply people.

Still, we can't ignore the pettiness and vulgarity. Greek gods weren't necessarily some high ideal to be emulated, at least not all the time. They were what you would expect from human beings who became all-powerful, with no real limits to their behavior, and very few (if any) compatriots who could curb their more animalistic tendencies.

There are YouTube videos out there of people zipping around in their ships that make me gape in awe; I'm nowhere close to that. I'm still pretty new to the game myself, and there is soooooo much to learn and become proficient at.

You have two small hardpoints on either side of the cockpit, and two medium hardpoints under the cockpit. I would lead my target more in the Viper than I might in the DBS; I'd put my nose either right under the other ship or even covering him slightly in order to get my guns to bear in tight turns. When you stand off a ways it's not such a big deal... you can bear on him better from 800 meters than you can from a couple of hundred. When the target was close, I had problems bringing my multicannons (medium HP's) to bear sometimes. Not so much of a problem that it wasn't insurmountable, mind you, just enough to be noticeable. That's where the greater maneuverability of the Mk III stands you in better stead, though the tankiness of the Mk IV means you can take a much bigger pounding. Once you get used to how the ship bears and turns you'll be just fine. Long range hit and runs are great in both ships; stand off, send a few salvos, turn and burn awa

In the DBS I feel like I have a bit more flexibility just due to how the hardpoints are arranged. I don't have to be quite as careful about where I place the nose of my ship.

96,"&gt; random ass NPCs being replaced with synths just makes no damn sense.

But are they really replacing NPC's randomly? One of the missions you undertake for Father has you recruiting a brilliant scientific mind from the wasteland; I'm assuming he would be replaced with a synth counterpart.

I wonder if the cases of all the replacements are because they recruited great minds that might further the goals of the Institute. Or perhaps they came across someone whose mind was unusual, and wanted to know what made it tick in order to either counteract it or to adopt it in further experiments. It would be an amoral psychology experiment, certainly, but one designed to benefit mankind as a whole (imagine what would happen if you could experiment on people with narcissistic personality disorders in order to create a treatment for the disorder, to abolish it in mankind.) And certainly the Institute is going to try to increase its influence over Commonwealth settlements and cities; replacing the mayor of Diamond City makes sense in light of how much the Commonwealth has unjustly vilified the Institute. Sure, that vilification has some merit, but I can point to atrocities on the part of *all* the Commonwealth factions, some of which are more horrible than that perpetrated by the Institute.

Honestly, the Commonwealth is a disaster. Father is right; given its history, it is a horror show compared with the peace and tranquility of the Institute.

99,"Before Revelation was written there were end-of-the-worlders. Hell, in religious groups not even remotely associated with the ramblings of an isolated desert tribe there were end-of-the-worlders (think Ragnarok, for instance.)

That being said, the end of life on Earth is most likely inevitable. In about 800 million - 1.2 billion years, at the latest. The Sun's luminosity will be so hot at that point that in 800 million years, multicellular life will be impossible on Earth, and in 1.2 billion years (give or take a hundred million years or so) unicellular life will be impossible. One could argue that Armageddon, or Ragnarok, or Billy Bob's Bonanza of Boomtastic Destruction will be accomplished at that late date.

Of course, that won't matter to much to us today. Probably won't matter to whatever beings evolve from us, assuming any do. Or to their evolved descendants either. 800 million years is a mind-bendingly long time.

And hey, depending on which end-of-the-universe scenario you subscribe to (there's a bit of debate about various theories, and they depend on a lot of variables that impact each theory differently), the Universe itself will likely reach maximum entropy in a minimum of 10^^100 years from now (roughly when the last black hole finishes decaying due to Hawking radiation.) After that, there is basically nothing but an extremely dilute gas of photons and leptons, a so-called Dark Era. There's nothing that could be alive after all that; at least, nothing that would match what we think of as life.

But again, that is a mind-bogglingly long time in the future. I don't think we can even really fully understand just how long a period of time that is; we can conceptualize it, but we have to simplify it just to discuss it.

And regardless of anything, none of that matches what the Bible or the Watchtower (or, really, any religion for that matter) states regarding the end of the world. It's just the ultimate end of things that matter to us. Hell, it's basically the ultimate end of matter, for that matter. Not that it will matter to us.

100,"Fear like this is a result of being conditioned for your entire life. This is not normal, and it certainly isn't good. What you are describing seems to be debilitating, especially as you are contemplating suicide as a means of escaping it, or at least setting up final plans just in case the unthinkable happens.

First, kudos for you for asking the question in the first place rather than choosing to suffer in silence.

Second, if you have the ability, you might want to speak to a therapist about these things. You need to stop being afraid of the future and a nebulous set of circumstances that were purposely constructed by a dangerous cult to control your behavior and thinking. That therapist can help you overcome the fear, and can teach you coping mechanisms to deal with the other stuff going on due to lifelong conditioning. You *can* learn these things on your own if you don't have the ability to go to a therapist, but it will take a bit more work and effort on your part to do so, and you will need to learn what triggers these thoughts and behaviors so you can circumvent or at least deal with them.

Third, if you have access to medical care, speak to your physician about this. You may have a chemical imbalance that is setting all this off; this can come about through years of stress, fear, and the aforementioned conditioning. Your body gets used to being in its *fight-or-flight* reflex, and can't get out of it; or perhaps your brain isn't producing the right cocktail of hormones and substances. There are medications that can help with this. Don't be afraid of this route; there are a LOT more people out there than you might think who are in need of anti-anxiety, anti-depression, or other meds. Some of us cannot live normally without these things.

What you're describing above sounds like, in my completely unprofessional and unqualified opinion, panic attacks and severe anxiety. This does NOT mean you are crazy. You simply have some issues that you haven't overcome as yet. There are things you can do to get past this. It might be therapy, might be medication. It might be a combination of both.

Understand... Armageddon ain't happening. Not the way the Society puts it, anyway. There is no psychotic, vengeful God out there plotting our demise.

My wife went to pioneer school and this topic was brought up by the Circuit Overseer for discussion. Of course you had a cacophony of ""well, I would *never* do that"" comments from the holier-than-thou types, but /u/truthcanbequestioned gave them the story of our attendance at grandpa's funeral. The CO backed her up, saying clearly that it was a conscience matter, and that brothers or sisters who attended non believing person's funerals were not to be judged.

That being said, the Devil is in the details: it might bother OP's conscience to attend the funeral of his mother, and therefore he might not. It's fucked up for him to feel that way about his own mother, but the reality is that he may still choose to not attend and use that as his reasoning (I'm assuming he had a normal relationship with her prior to becoming a Witness... if they had a strained relationship, or there were circumstances leading to him distancing himself from her, then who can blame him?)",2016-10-26 13:19:22+00:00,d98fj73,2.0,t1_d98dfzd,3914.0,exjw

140,"He can't enforce the ""this month"" decree. You have ~~30 days from the date the eviction was served to you.~~ (see edit below).

Edit 2: As /u/cappytan-exjw writes below, you may have only 20 days notice to terminate tenancy, which means that yeah, you only have until the 31st. If I were you, I'd ask that question of a professional and see how much time you have. Then again, if I were you, I would be trying my best to find a less toxic atmosphere to live in. Portland is expensive, and shared homes are not uncommon there as I understand it. (/edit 2)

Also, an eviction notice has to be served properly (in Washington, that means he only has to deliver notice to evict to you personally, which your father has done), and the tenant (you) must have failed to comply, pay, or vacate within the specified timeframe. This must happen **before** the landlord can begin the eviction court process by serving you an ""unlawful detainer"" eviction lawsuit.

[**Here**](http://www.tenantsunion.org/en/rights/eviction-process) is the eviction process according to the Tenants Union of Washington State. Note the following most common notices to vacate:

1. 3-day notice to pay or vacate
2. 10-day notice to comply with the terms of the rental agreement or vacate
3. 3-day notice for waste or nuisance
4. 20-day notice to terminate tenancy (a “no cause” notice)

Read all the sections in that article. You have certain protections as a leasing tenant; you pay rent, you have certain rights that your father cannot deny. If you have a written lease (I doubt that since this is a father/child arrangement) then you have even more rights as long as you are not in violation of the leasing agreement. In most states the eviction process is an absolute pain in the ass for a landlord and can take up to six months to a year to complete.

Of course, this all depends on whether or not you want to continue living in such a hostile environment.

Sorry you're going through all this. It sucks that your dad is being an asshole.

Edit 1: Also... don't throw fuel on the fire. If you are seen as combative, and you are doing things to cause disruption and disturbance, or adding to the hostile atmosphere, then that works against you in the entire process. Be calm, be rational, be peaceable. Don't take any unnecessary shit, but don't instigate either. Don't talk about the organization with him unless he brings it up, and then keep your comments short and polite. You don't have to let him walk all over you; you aren't a doormat after all, but try to be rational rather than angry. That's Legal 101 when dealing with **anyone** who is trying to set up proceedings against you.

Edit 2: see above

Edit 3: Check out the Tenant's Union FAQ for some clarification of all the above. It generally takes around 3 weeks (20 days) to enforce the writ on an eviction, though time can vary. The FAQ also has resources to help you move, specifically this:

&gt; Are there any resources to help me move?

&gt; It can be very difficult to find assistance moving into and out of rental units. Few agencies offer this type of assistance. Call “Washington State 2-1-1’:http://www.resourcehouse.com/win211/ at 206-461-3200 or 800-621-4636 or 2-1-1 from a landline to see if there is any help in your area.",2016-10-11 18:28:59+00:00,d8nns9x,5.0,t1_d8nn2sy,863.0,exjw
141,"&gt; 1) does anyone on the elder body even know about the prohibition on oral/anal sex?

Yes, they do. This is something that is widely known in both the congregation and elder bodies.

&gt; 2) If they do, do they see only ""natural"" sex practices as having ""no limits"" placed on them?

To the organization, ""natural"" sex practices involves vaginal intercourse, with perhaps some limited digital manipulation to facilitate things. Anything else is held in taboo, and is often lumped into the catch-all category of unclean, loose, and brazen conduct (this catch-all is used to justify a lot of disciplinary actions on the parts of the elders and Society in general).

This is a common outlook with a lot of fundamentalist Christian religions, and is a holdover of American puritanical values and views from the 18th and 19th centuries, when Victorian mores were the norm (at least for Western societies). It could be my own biases slanting my viewpoint here, but this attitude seems to have been especially prevalent in the USA where the organization was started, and still strongly influences societal views today.

Now, understand please, that a lot of discretion is left up to the individual elder bodies of various congregations for a variety of things. You may, for instance, be a part of a congregation with a relatively liberal (for Witnesses) sexual outlook. In that case, were it found out that you enjoyed oral sex with your spouse, nothing may be done about it. However, elders are trained to err on the side of caution and conservatism; I would submit that a sexually liberal congregation would be an outlier, and that if you were in another congregation you would more likely find that you would find yourself in a shepherding call rather quickly. If they determined that you were unrepentant about your actions and behavior, you could lose privileges and position (if you had any) or even face disfellowshipping as a result; your actions would fall under unclean acts, with loose and/or brazen conduct.

The Society has mastered the art of double speak. They produce articles like the one linked so that they can plausibly say ""but look, newly interested people, we're not so different in our outlook to what you already think!"" Then, when you've been roped in, you find the restrictions on your behavior getting tighter. That's why I stated above that unless the Watchtower has provided clear direction, the former articles and restrictions have not been superceded.",2016-10-11 13:11:55+00:00,d8n978w,7.0,t1_d8n6nay,5390.0,exjw

It's utter bullshit; you're quite correct in saying that the bible doesn't specifically mention oral sex (hell, it doesn't really touch on anal sex between a hetero couple either, I believe.) However, oral is generally categorized by the Society (and many Christian churches) as uncleanness, loose conduct, or brazen conduct... all of which can result in disfellowshipping if it's decided that the person engaging in those actions is unrepentant over doing them.

Keep in mind this tidbit also: **masturbation** isn't mentioned specifically in the bible either. However, you can still be DF'd, counseled, or at least removed from privileges for unrepentently flogging the dolphin under the above categories.

&gt;Can a person be disfellowshipped from the Christian congregation for engaging in uncleanness as he can be for fornication or loose conduct?

&gt;Yes, an individual can be expelled from the congregation if he unrepentantly practices either fornication, **some forms of uncleanness, or loose conduct.** The apostle Paul cites all three of these sins along with other disfellowshipping offenses when he writes: **“The works of the flesh are manifest, and they are fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct . . .

155,"I always find it interesting to see how your experiences in 'Straya differs from ours here in the States.

Here in the States, homeopathy might be more accepted than it is in Australia (I couldn't tell you for certain, only having lived in a *normal* nation, never having been to your upside-down, weird assed, drop bear infested, Mad Max, every-animal-wants-to-kill-you country.) However, it's still pretty much out of the norm for most people. If you tell people you're an anti-vaxxer here, the majority of people will look at you with combined horror and pity for your obvious mental incapacity; ditto for crystal healers, herbal medicine, and magnet aura enhancers. Granted, that group of people are becoming a more sizeable part of the population than they used to be, but most of us have hope that natural selection will win out in the end and that portion of the gene pool will die out in a few generations. Personally, I'm far more pessimistic, since US politicians are hopelessly beating science about the head in an effort to deny it on both sides (conservatives with their staunch resistance to climate change and scientific literacy, and liberals with their insistence on acceptance of homeopathy as valid medicine, and let's face it... they don't much like scientific literacy either.)

Mind you, there is some evidence that some stuff from homeopathy works... but so does [the placebo effect.](http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-the-placebo-effect)

They mean ""penises in vaginas."" That's all they mean by that. BJ's are still not kosher, as is cunnilingus, anal play, digital manipulation (masturbation), etc.

This isn't the first time the WTBTS has played word games in their articles. I've seen this same shit many times before; it's all regurgitated from previous articles.

Also, it leaves a lot to the interpretation of your local body of elders. Younger Brother BJaysarecool will be outvoted almost every time by old-assed Brother Puritansexonly.

179,"&gt; some people do actually downvote that are members of the sub because they disagree or have negative feelings towards the comments

If you have a voting system, people will use it to give vent to their support or displeasure, regardless of whether or not Reddit states that it's supposed to just be for whether or not the topic is germane to the overall group discussion. We pretty much all do it to some degree or other. That's just the nature of the beast. They may be in-JW trolls (and considering how many JW trolls we used to get in here posting inflammatory threads, I'd suspect that probably accounts for many of the downvotes... we don't exactly hide our presence on Reddit.) It may also be an ex-Dub who disagrees with the statement or feels somehow that the comment isn't pertinent to the discussion. You get all kinds of people in here, and just because someone claims to be an exJW doesn't mean they think, feel, or look at things the same way you or I do. 

I've seen people who state they are exes jump all over a fellow ex-Dub for being gay, for being trans, for being hetero, for enjoying sex with multiple partners, for thinking sex should be between married partners only, for smoking pot, for going out to party, for staying home on weekends, for seeking secondary education, for not seeking secondary education, etc. Hell, the first time I was ever gilded was in this subreddit for making a defense of a fellow exDub who was being horribly bullied by one of our more unstable members (I swear I wasn't trying to white knight or anything; it's just that the bullying had gotten to a very bad point). It happens that some people just don't play nicely with others, and by our very nature we have some very damaged and unstable people who frequent the sub.

Obviously I don't know your personal situation, so I can't comment as to whether or not you'd be wasting time or money on going back to school, but consider:

TCBQ was 37, almost 38 when she started. She'll be 40-41 when she graduates. Since retirement age is (hopefully, but probably not) 65-67, that's 25 years plus or minus to advance in her career (let's face it, retirement age is getting further and further away.)

I've got an associate's degree in CADD technology right now, but when TCBQ graduates I'm planning on going back to school to change my career path; my credits won't transfer (I went the tech school route the Society encouraged instead of an actual university which they strongly discouraged... gotta love that really awesome and valuable ITT tech degree now, yo!) I'm turning 42 this year and won't be able to get into school again until I'm 44ish. Half of my AA credits are accounted for (went to school for a bit in the Recession when I was out of work), so I should graduate by 45ish.

I won't lie. It's been pretty damned hard on occasion, and there have been plenty of roadblocks and pitfalls that have hit us. This has been a difficult journey at our stage in life, but we think it's completely worth it.

214,"Why in the world would anyone think it is okay to medicate a child because they don't want to play a game? That makes no sense to me. So don't make them do it. Offer it in the library or computer lab for free play. If you have a computer in the classroom make it a group project, but do it in a way that engages them, like role playing games. Or offer it as a reward for downtime if they meet certain goals. If it's used for grading, make it extra credit. Or don't offer it at all; if my class is one that wouldn't use the subject matter at all and I couldn't figure out a way to make it remotely applicable, then outside of being a reward for meeting goals it might not have a place. Some of the kids will find it interesting, where others won't... just like any subject. There are many ways to avoid coercion, or to coerce in a manner that overcomes pushback and catches their attention. And hey, not everyone is going to find it interesting. That's fine; at least they might learn something regardless. No method reaches everyone equally effectively all of the time.

Back when I was a middle schooler, so, so many years ago, we had copies of the old Oregon Trail on our library Apple 2's (told you it was many years ago.) No one forced us to play an educational game, but we wore those things out. Minecraft can be used educationally, and my kids have teachers who have done that (seems to work well with teaching organization, order, and math.) They still love Minecraft, and play it frequently.

My fifth grader has begun developing an interest in Renaissance and Revolutionary American history, in part due to Assassin's Creed. My point is that gaming can ignite a passion for learning in some kids, and can be just one of many tools used by educators.

Or don't use it. That's your choice as an educator. You should know far better than I what works for your kids. I make no claim to know anything about teaching, except from a parental point of view.

226,"&gt; ...but I totally understand you will not attend.

The wording is key here. There is no ambiguity, the author has stated that his expectation is nonattendance. This is backed up by the previous statement:

&gt; I wanted you to have as a keepsake this invitation.

In other words, here's a reminder of what you're missing out on; don't believe this to be an actual invitation. This is then followed by placing all the blame on OP, by stating that ""it would've been nice"" to be together, but OP won't be there.

Then you have the passive ""We wish it could be different."" They are again absolving themselves of any responsibility or blame for the lack of contact. They are making it clear that this is something that they don't want, but OP's actions have created the situation that they are burdened with. This is followed with an appeal to return while there is time to do so, with a clear insinuation that only by doing so will the privilege of contact be restored.

This was all a big ""Fuck you"" from the author to OP. It's passively written to absolve the author of a guilty conscience for being an absolute cunt of a person.

To /u/Usedtopioneer: I'm sorry that this happened to you. You're right in how you took this. Personally, no matter what happened in the future, I would make it a point to cut this person out of my life completely. What they did was reprehensible, unloving, and vilely manipulative.

It's that open endedness, that lack of finality, that refusal to provide closure that helps make a great story even greater in my opinion. One person leaves, and what becomes of him is unknown.

242,"This isn't as exciting as some of the stories on here, but it affected me all the same.

One night when I was a teenager, after dark, I was washing dishes as an assigned chore. I had a kitten that my stepfather (who detested cats with a passion) had banned from the house; this night was pretty cool and I had let him in while my stepfather was doing a night shift as a sheriff's deputy. The kitten (well, adolescent cat by this point) had managed to jump up on the counter as I was washing up.

All of a sudden, I hear the slide of metal against leather, and the click of a gun safety turned off (I was raised with guns; I knew the sound.) My stepfather's voice, utterly chilling and deadpan, comes through the open window behind my back: ""Get that fucking cat off my counter or I'll kill it."" The only problem was, I was directly between him and the cat, with the cat in my arms. There is no doubt in my mind that my stepfather's sidearm was pointed right at my back.

Especially since a few days prior to that he had calmly told me how he would one day murder me, mutilate and dismember my body, and hide the pieces in gator holes around the county he was a deputy in. It was a very rural area in south Florida; I would have disappeared, and there would have been no evidence.

From the age of 12 until I left to live with a relative at about 16, my life was lived in terror through mental and verbal abuse (some physical abuse, but nothing that would leave marks... he *was* a deputy sheriff and former Marine drill instructor after all). It was made clear to me that I was nothing and worthless, and that one day that man was going to kill me.

This is a guy who is billed (and bills himself) as the greatest, most powerful being in all of creation. He was defeated by men in iron chariots.

This is a guy who is supposed to be the creator and exemplar of virtue; of power, of justice, of wisdom, and of love. Yet we can point to examples from his own propaganda publication (the Bible) that show him behaving oppositely to those qualities.

Epicurus said it best:

Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. 
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? 
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?”

If God exists, then he is a petty, vindictive, and evil god... not the personification of love. He's delusional if he thinks or says otherwise.

282,"Shit. You made me realize right now that I fucked up last night with my youngest son. He was being emotional (over tired from the day) and came to complain about the tv not working for him. He started crying because the tv wasn't playing the video he wanted (Amazon fire stick and YouTube - he's used to video on demand.)

Crying hits certain triggers for me. It's been weaponized by various people throughout my life for manipulation, especially by an old ex-wife. I'm also the end product of years of abuse and being in a position of being taught that crying (or any emotional vulnerability) on my part is a weakness that will be exploited by others. I tend to react poorly to tears. I'm better than I used to be (thanks to my kids, and a very understanding second wife.)

I told him to stop being a cry-baby and explain to me what the problem was calmly. While I was right in directing him to be calm and explain the problem to me, I was very wrong for telling him to not be a ""cry-baby."" I feel like a complete asshole now.

I need to give the kid a hug when I get home, and try to remember not to let that trigger hit me when it happens again.

292,"I'm subbed here to /r/Teachers. I only say this because I'm also subbed to /r/exjw, and I notice one of my fellow ex-Jehovah's Witnesses linked your thread to their sub. You will probably get a lot of advice from them (us). I was also on the other side of this issue once, as a JW parent of two kids going through the school system (I have four kids total, but my wife and I woke up a few years back and the younger two have either not had to deal with the religion, or dealt with it young enough to forget most of it.) First, understand that you are dealing with a high control religion (a cult, basically... but stated more nicely.)

Though JW's like to present themselves as a monolithic, homogeneous group, they are not. Parents can decide certain things for themselves and their children (limited things that are considered ""conscience matters."") Your parents may be more strict than what my wife and I once were, or perhaps more liberal. For teachers, it's a minefield. Sorry about that.

Here's some stuff that might help you though, since you seem concerned with work-arounds:

1. The social studies curriculum calls for units dealing with American customs, history, and civics. Present the curriculum in this way. Let the parents know that you will not knowingly have their child engage in activities that the religion considers ""worship"" of the nation (singing the national anthem, stating the Pledge of Allegiance, participating in a classroom voting process.) The parents may decide they'd still prefer to keep the kid away from the entire thing and have their kids go to the library or work on something else. My wife and I never went to this extreme, as we thought it important for the kids to understand the overall society they were a part of, but many JW parents I knew weren't as ""liberal"" as we were.

2. For holidays: when I was a JW parent, I tried to be proactive about finding out what the classroom would do in regards to holidays and birthdays. As parents, my wife and I would then try to compromise with the teacher and come up with alternate activities that we could provide (we didn't expect the teachers to do this on their own.) This didn't always happen smoothly, of course. /u/teovall brings out a good idea in creating other options. Back then, I didn't have a problem with the kids engaging in seasonal activities, just holiday-specific ones. Instead of doing a jack-o-lantern project, we'd be fine with the kids doing an autumnal project (making paper leaves, doing a fall-themed art scene, etc.) Ditto for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The older kids lost out on being in band or chorus because they had to participate in holiday songs (I really regret this now.)

3. Birthdays: my wife and I would make arrangements for the kids to go to the library or something. It was the best we could do with our understanding and indoctrination at the time. We didn't freak out if the kids were ""tempted"" into eating a cupcake or something, but there are other JW parents who would. For our kids birthdays, we tended to keep them out that day and try to find something fun for them to do (we luckily live near Disney World.) It still sucks for the kid, as he/she is still singled out as different. The parents will likely try to justify it with the Watchtower's indoctrination of ""we celebrate life everyday"" or something similar (""the Bible only lists two examples of birthdays and death was involved, we don't want to displease God, the kids weren't raised with holidays/birthdays, so they don't really miss out, etc."") It's total BS, but they likely believe it.

I hope that helps in some way.

There are many, many things I would change for my older kids back then. Not being in a cult like Jehovah's Witnesses is one big one. No matter how much you try, that kid is being taught by his parents and religion that they should ""be no part of the world.""",2016-09-15 13:12:02+00:00,d7nqqry,1.0,t3_52u6k1,37843.0,Teachers

Some of his greatest hits in the [Skeptic's Annotated Bible.](http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/cruelty/long.html)

Some of my personal faves:

Ex. 4:23, where Jehovah threatens to kill Pharoah's firstborn son.

Ex. 4:24-26, where Jah decides to murder Moses because he didn't chop off a part of his penis.

Ez. 8:18, where God promises to kill everyone, and says he'll ignore them when they plead for mercy.

Ez. 12:15-16, 20, where God states that he's going to murder people horrifically; by sword, by famine, and pestilence, but he's going to spare a few just so they can tell others about how terrible they were and deserved the death and destruction they received.

Nahum 3:10, where God punishes Nineveh by enslaving the people and smashing children in the streets. Smashing probably involved soldiers picking them up and dashing their heads into the pavement or walls until they died.

Luke 3:17, where John the Baptist proclaims that Jesus is going to burn people with unquenchable fire.

1 Cor. 10:10, where God tells us that if we murmer (criticize or question) he'll destroy us.

1 Thess. 1:10, Jehovah is planning ahead of time to painfully and horrifically murder people in great terror all over the world in the greatest mass murder in history. Only Jesus can save you from it... but 2 Thess. 1:7-9 tells us that Jesus is planning on taking vengeance on anyone not knowing or agreeing with God by torturing them to death (or for eternity, depending on your version of Christianity.)

Don't forget, he made a favored prophet eat cow dung-heated bread for years. This was a merciful thing though... God originally planned to make him eat it after it had been heated over human feces - Ez. 4:15

Back in high school (many, many years ago... so many...) I worked in a supermarket meat department. We used to receive our beef in boxes that weighed 90 pounds each if I recall correctly. We would stack those on floor racks (a rack that held it a few inches above the floor at minimum) and have them 4-5 boxes high. Going by weight, that would be roughly the same size as a full cow, or about $2,000 worth of meat.

We tended to throw chicken on the top racks as well, since they came in boxes that were only 40-60 lbs. and were much easier to lift overhead.

353,"&gt;  if you sang Jingle Bells what kind of trouble could you get into?

None, really. The argument can be made that Jingle Bells isn't a *Christmas* song; it's a *winter* song. There is no specific mention of Christmas in the song at all. Ditto for Winter Wonderland, as I recall. Greensleaves was, as I understand it, a romantic song written for King Henry VIII for a lover. There are a number of songs which a JW can justify as being totally fine if they want to make the mental contortions and gymnastics to do so.

In all honesty, you wouldn't get in trouble by singing a Christmas carol. The damn things are ear worms; they surround you constantly, you find yourself singing along or humming them, and you get all the joy of conscience pangs when you realize you're doing something you shouldn't be and are in desperate need of abasing yourself to God and asking forgiveness for your weak and sinful human nature. If you are caught doing it by an elder, you might get counselled not to sing carols for reasons of paganism, being separate from the world, etc., but it's not like they would disfellowship or really discipline you for singing a song. You would definitely get *Disapproving Stare #43* (see your manual of Disapproving Stares for specifics.)

Now, going out and caroling throughout the neighborhood, hitting up the Catholic or Anglican Christmas Mass, putting up a tree and passing out gifts, and in general being a willing participant in an evil, pagan, and Satanic celebration of the old Saturnalia festival (Christmas)... well, you'd find yourself in a spot of bother for sure. At the least you'd be hauled in for a shepherding visit with two elders, and very likely be explaining your actions to a three-elder judicial committee (where they determine if you are disfellowshipped or by your actions have disassociated yourself... which carries the same consequences regardless).",2016-08-08 17:39:05+00:00,d699dnh,3.0,t1_d698hjr,1127.0,exjw

Hollywood has managed some fine adaptations (*Taming of the Shrew*, *Hamlet*, and *Romeo and Juliet* - the 70's version - spring to mind.) However, for the best effect, watch Shakespeare on stage with a group of actors who know him well.

Some of his wit is lost when we read the plays; after all, we're speaking of a writer who has been dead for several hundred years. But when we see the action in person... when we see a troupe bring it to life... then the impact of that wit, that dry humor, and the mastery of language really hits us.

I think it's amazing that The Bard has been dead for over 400 years and yet his works are still fascinating people today.

370,"You're correct about starting from the bottom up. I'd like to add this: the presidency, while a very powerful position, does not make legislation. The president can issue executive orders, but those orders can be completely undone by the following president if he/she chooses. The president can veto legislation... but can be overruled in this by Congress (though that's very, very difficult in reality.) Sure, the President is also the head of his/her own party and can lead them in making policies... but without a majority in Congress that might mean nothing at all as far as the direction the country takes.

You want real change in American politics? You want corporations out of elections? You want pro-science and pro-environmentalist legislation? You want LGBT+ rights upheld, enforced, and enhanced? You want civil rights for *everyone,* and not just a few? You want an actual separation of church and state, in the face of an increasingly violent and virulent religious movement set on turning the US into a theocracy? You want the banking industry regulated? You want education to be made attainable by all without the mountain of debt forced on students today? You want consumer protection against predatory business practices? You want universal healthcare? You want adequate health services for the public and for the less fortunate? You want net neutrality and regulated public utilities?

Then you better start changing the people in Congress, or getting them on board with progressive values and platforms. The presidency is extremely important... but if you want lasting change, you need to change the government branch responsible for creating the laws of the land, as well as getting your local government in order.

You want either party to either adopt more progressive values, or to fade away in favor of a third party? Then get your asses in gear and begin voting for your congressional elections. That's where you make a real difference in government. That's the body with arguably the most power and influence over how the government is run.

393,"&gt; It's only to be done at the direction of the branch and only when a person meets their criteria for a sexual predator.

Just to emphasize what you brought up (and you did a great job of it):

It's at the Watchtower's discretion. Plus, the Watchtower Society is who determines what constitutes a sexual predator, not the police, not the courts, not the government...

The organization, which has no actual training (that I know or have heard of), which pooh-poohs psychological research, treatment, and medicine, which espouses paranoia towards all things governmental (such as the police, the courts, etc.) as belonging to Satan and which then claims that these organizations are all out to get the Society, again because ""Satan""... THIS is the group of people who determine if a person is a sexual predator or not. The same group who has spent millions of dollars hiding sexual predators, fighting against the victims of those predators, and otherwise blaming the parents and children who've been victimized, is the same group that determines if a person represents a danger to children in the congregation.

394,"&gt; The thing is, if i were a jw i couldn't have lied and said I wasn't one.

Sure you could. We see it frequently.

&gt; know your shit before you spew it.

I was a member of the congregation. I was a ministerial servant and pioneer. My wife was a regular pioneer for years, and went to Pioneer School. I used to deliver both instructional and public talks. I was one of the Sunday speakers. We were used on convention and assembly programs. I was the literature counter servant. I know my shit. I used to watch the brothers and sisters (including the elder body) lie all the time. The very nature of the organization lends itself to lying, since it's a very paranoid and mistrustful group, and people are constantly monitoring each other for aberrations so that they can either feel smugly superior to one another or so they can run off to the elders to report on someone else. It happens all the time.

&gt; They are following the principples of the bible. 

They follow those principles that suit them at the moment, just as every other religion does. The principles they follow also change over the years. Did you know that in 1947, the Awake magazine (January 8, pg 27) described the practice of excommunication as unscriptural and pagan, and used Hebrews 10:26-31 to show that judgment of others should be left to God? Strangely enough, Knorr (one of the governing body members of the time) arranged the current disfellowshipping arrangement through supposed ""bible principles"" that has been followed until today shortly afterwards. Did you know that under the power of Charles Taze Russel, baptismal candidates only consecrated themselves to Jehovah only, and that it was specifically noted that baptism was not to any particular sect? This carried through the 1950's: Watchtower stated in its pages on July 1, 1955, page 411 that ""A Christian, therefore, cannot be baptized in the name of the one actually doing the immersing or in the name of any man, nor in the name of any organization, but in the name of the Father, the Son and the holy spirit."" In total disregard of Biblical guidance and the Watchtower's own previous comments, in 1985 it became a requirement for baptismal candidates to swear their association with the Organization.

And don't get me started on the supposed bible principle they follow regarding the Generation teaching. That has been an ongoing cluster fuck for the Organization and the Governing Body. It has been changed so many times that the vast majority of JW's today have no clue as to what it actually is... come on, man, ""overlapping generations"" now? Really? That's the best we could do?

Those are just a couple of ""bible principles"" that JW's have claimed to follow, and then changed, and then changed again... so, as I stated, they follow those principles that suit them at the moment.

Personally, I don't give a flying fuck if you're a Witness or not. My money would be on you either being a JW, or at least closely associated with them, but honestly I don't care. You state that:

&gt; Dem guys be real yo. Their faith is real

I can say the same thing about a variety of other religions and cults. You know who else ""be real, yo?"" Westboro Baptist Church. Those guys are also quite real about their faith. Mormons are known to be real about their faith as well. Jihadists will sacrifice themselves (and everyone else within a hundred yards) for their faith. Scientologists seem pretty keen on their faith. Catholics, especially the Irish Republican Army, have been known to be real about their faith. Oliver Cromwell was quite real about his faith, much to the dismay of the Catholic Irish in 1649-1650.

See, the thing about folks who ""be real, yo"" about their faith is this: it doesn't make them right. It doesn't even make them good people. It doesn't make them any better than anyone else, no matter how much they claim to be. They are no more real than any other person you meet.",2016-06-29 12:27:04+00:00,d4sg8o9,5.0,t1_d4s6qbs,27758.0,todayilearned
395,"&gt; Father says, ""I'm telling you, they're going to ban religion soon.""...  is such an idea completely out of the realm of existence in the foreseeable future?

I only bring up the following in order to help clarify the problem facing a potential religious ban. Self identified atheists comprise anywhere from 2% to 13% of the world's population. People without a religion comprise anywhere from 10% to 22% of the world's population. The actual figures vary depending on poll. There are a number of statistical problems facing pollsters that prevent a better data set. [Source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism) Now, compare the numbers of the nonreligious to the religious:

Given that roughly 80% of the world's population (again, with the same statistical problems as listed above) *is* religiously affiliated, and the world's population being [roughly 7.4 billion people](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/)...

Is it logical to think that the UN, which can't even get countries to agree that Saudi Arabia is guilty of human rights violations [despite ample evidence](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/saudi-arabia), is really going to effectively exert control over hundreds of sovereign nations and ban religion? How would they enforce such a ban on over **5.9 billion** people?

The UN is largely a paper tiger. It is not a global government; to simplify it greatly, the UN is basically an entity that helps various nations to use diplomacy to solve their problems. It cannot effectively act unilaterally on much at all; it has to have the buy-in of at least the Security Council in order to prosecute military (erm, peacekeeping) actions. [Peacekeeper forces can only be used when both sides agree to it, and they are very limited in what actions they are allowed to take.](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/principles.shtml) 

This idea that Witnesses teach, that the UN will somehow ban religion is ludicrous. It can't. It's not a global legislative body in that way. Plus, you don't piss off 80% or more of the world's population and survive the experience... and banning something as deeply identified with as a person's religion is certainly going to piss them off, just a wee little bit. It might even be a minor annoyance when they really think about it.",2016-06-29 01:47:00+00:00,d4s0r2f,1.0,t3_4qc98y,10967.0,exjw

400,"&gt; Its more like entering into a business contract.

Are children allowed to enter into business contracts? No? Then baptism is not like entering into a business contract. Children are unable to understand the details of entering into a contract. They are unable to understand the details of being Jehovah's Witnesses and the penalties if they decide later on that the religion isn't for them. They are unable to make rational and mature decisions on subjects that may affect their entire lives. This is one reason, among others, why governments typically do not allow (by law) minors to enter into business agreements or contracts, or lifelong commitments for that matter. The decisions that you make as a child are usually not the same ones you might make when you are an adult.

Anthony Morris III, governing body member of Jehovah's Witnesses, and [his views of teenage baptism.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKVMFGfh0uc)

David Splane, also a governing body member, [backs up child baptism in a trip to Sweden.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh8FNlAIrh8)

One can also make the argument that many adults are given whitewashed information about the organization by its members, elders, and the organization itself. You are discouraged from seeking outside information about the organization, because anything detrimental to it is from the Devil (they do love quoting throughout their literature that scripture at 1 John 5:19 about the whole world lying in the power of the wicked one, i.e. Satan). When adults are indoctrinated against seeking outside sources of information, when they have been indoctrinated to only use the organization's sources for answering questions, then one cannot say that adult has the full range of information necessary to make a rational decision. The penalties of leaving the organization (shunning from both family and friends, losing your entire social network, being cast adrift and ignored as though you are dead from people you love and need in your life) are glossed over and largely hidden. Blame is assigned to the person leaving, or who decides they no longer want to live their lives in accordance with the organization (much as you've done above.) That person is labelled as wicked, corrupt, and evil.

Businesses can fire you for not abiding by their terms. What they cannot do is coerce or force people into shunning the fired person. What they cannot do is destroy that person's social network. They are not allowed to force that former employee's family to have nothing to do with them. Businesses are not allowed to drive that former employee into a state of despair and depression through suggesting that people have nothing at all to do with him. They are not allowed to fuck with that person's mental health; but the Watchtower Society does this and brags about it in their own literature. It instructs its followers to do this to their ""loved"" ones.

&gt;* ""What if we have a relative or a close friend who is disfellowshipped? Now our loyalty is on the line, not to that person, but to God. Jehovah is watching us to see whether we will abide by his command not to have contact with anyone who is disfellowshipped.—Read 1 Corinthians 5:11-13. 

&gt;      Consider just one example of the good that can come when a family loyally upholds Jehovah’s decree not to associate with disfellowshipped relatives. A young man had been disfellowshipped for over ten years, during which time his father, mother, and four brothers “quit mixing in company” with him. At times, he tried to involve himself in their activities, but to their credit, each member of the family was steadfast in not having any contact with him. After he was reinstated, he said that he always missed the association with his family, especially at night when he was alone. But, he admitted, had the family associated with him even a little, that small dose would have satisfied him. However, because he did not receive even the slightest communication from any of his family, the burning desire to be with them became one motivating factor in his restoring his relationship with Jehovah."" Watchtower 2012 Apr 15 p.12

&gt;* “A conflict of loyalties may arise when a close relative is disfellowshipped. For example, a sister named Anne received a telephone call from her disfellowshipped mother. The mother wanted to visit Anne because she felt pained by her isolation from the family. Anne was deeply distressed by the plea and promised to reply by letter. Before writing, she reviewed Bible principles. (1 Cor. 5:11; 2 John 9-11) Anne wrote and kindly reminded her mother that she had cut herself off from the family by her wrongdoing and unrepentant attitude. “The only way you can relieve your pain is by returning to Jehovah,” Anne wrote.” Watchtower 2016 Feb p.29

&gt;* ""Are you personally proving yourself holy with regard to not associating with family members or others who have been disfellowshipped?"" Watchtower 2014 Nov 15 p.14

&gt;* ""Really, what your beloved family member needs to see is your resolute stance to put Jehovah above everything else - including the family bond. … Do not look for excuses to associate with a disfellowshipped family member, for example, through e-mail."" Watchtower 2013 Jan 15 p.16

&gt;* ""And all members of the congregation need to be determined to avoid the company of disfellowshipped individuals."" Watchtower 2011 Nov 15 p.5

""Oh, my goodness! She's outside in her bra!"" ...And? If she was outside in a bathing suit, would that get the same reaction? ...""Oh, it's not the same thing!"" ...It's not? How? Is she somehow displaying more skin than she would in a bikini?

Or when a sister would come back to the car all flustered because a man answered the door in a pair of boxers. Do you not realize that he's wearing an item of clothing that roughly corresponds to the same skin coverage as a pair of shorts? Unless his ween is hanging out (never a good idea, unless you're at a nudist colony) it's the same damned thing really.

Peeps of all sorts get bent out of shape over something that's purely in their minds. Just because it's underwear doesn't mean diddly. I've seen people in Speedos at the beaches here in Florida that left more skin bare than the briefs they were wearing, but one is somehow okay where the other is not.

There is no fucking reason for the Borg to get that intimately involved in people's families... except for the attainment of absolute control over those same people.

However, the vast majority of us here in the States still had the invisible bar to appointment if we wore beards.

Plus, there is the masterful ""oh you can do it, but you *shouldn't* if you're a faithful Christian"" twist the Society loves to engage in:

&gt; Even so, some brothers might decide not to wear a beard. (1 Cor. 8:9, 13; 10:32)

*1 Cor. 8:9, 13 - But keep watching that your right to choose does not somehow become a stumbling block to those who are weak... That is why if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat at all, so that I will not make my brother stumble.*

*1 Cor 10:32 - Keep from becoming causes for stumbling to Jews as well as Greeks and to the congregation of God,*

And the two-faced, weasel worded paragraph continues with this:

&gt; In other cultures or localities, beards are not the custom and are not considered acceptable for Christian ministers. In fact, having one may hinder a brother from bringing glory to God by his dress and grooming and his being irreprehensible.

Which puts everything at the discretion of the local brothers-in-charge. This means that if 80-year old Rutherford-taught Brother Stick-In-The-Ass thinks you shouldn't wear a beard, then you won't be appointed if you have one. Basically, no matter what, if your local BOE doesn't think beards are appropriate, then they can use that entire paragraph as justification to keep from appointing you.

The simple fact remains that this is still behavioral control. They are **permitting** you the *possibility* of being able to wear a beard (pending approval, of course.) Here's your treat, now roll over like the good little dog you are. However, right there in the paragraph, they are making it clear to people that they still don't want facial hair at the meetings (except for a good old pedo-stache.

By the way, I actually agree with you that there **should** be no confusion when you say something like ""point three-eight."" There really shouldn't... but we humans manage to fuck things up frequently, especially when we are used to hearing them referred to a certain way all our lives. When something comes in that can potentially cause confusion, especially when it's something that deals with instruments of death, destruction, and general mayhem, then it behooves us to be as clear as possible about it. Is it really that important? Probably not. If someone can't figure out what we're talking about pretty quickly, then that person probably shouldn't be stocking ammo supplies for your local gun store.

540,"&gt; you did not explain at all why ""point xx"" can lead to any confusions versus ""xx caliber""

Because you're using two different naming conventions. When you use the wrong naming conventions to people who are used to the right ones, you confuse the issue. Because when I brag about my penis size, I want to lyingly state that I'm eight *inches*, not 8 *millimeters.*

When you say you want ""point-five-oh ammo,"" are you telling that person you want fifty-cal, or are you saying you want .50mm? *(Is that even a type of cartridge? Just how small is that gun? Do we have something like that in stock? What the hell is this guy asking me? Does he mean .50 caliber? Why didn't he just ask for it properly? Is he an idiot? Am I an idiot? Is this all a joke?)* What you specifically asked for was (per convention) .50mm.

When you use whole numbers to describe your ammo, your supplier, your gun-loving friends, and all the ladies at the bar who are impressed by men who know weaponry KNOW you're describing caliber size (ammo measured in inches.) When you throw in decimals, all those people KNOW you're using metric sizes.

When it comes to objects that can create a lot of destruction, be clear. Use the normal, most commonly used nomenclature. Is it really life threatening to state ""I want 'point three-eight' ammo?"" No, it's not. The gun shop owner is going to quickly figure out what you mean. However, he's also going to mentally dismiss you almost immediately as not being worth his time... after he collects your payment, of course (he's not stupid, after all.)",2016-04-25 18:27:27+00:00,d2guoz7,6.0,t1_d2gsi2n,2837.0,ManyATrueNerd
541,"&gt; I do believe ""point xx"" is very common terminology with calibers

No. People are downvoting you, but they aren't explaining why they are downvoting.

General rule of thumb: for inch-designated numbers (calibers), you pronounce them by whole numbers. For metric-designated numbers, you pronounce them with the individual numbers and the decimal point. As for this:

&gt; there is no risk of misunderstanding and I don't see any kind of an issue with it.

There **is** a very real problem with misunderstanding the differences, and there **are** issues with using the wrong nomenclature. At best, you select ammo that obviously doesn't fit your firearm. At worst, it appears to fit, but really doesn't... and this can sometimes lead to catastrophic results.

Common parlance for ammunition is ""45 caliber,"" not ""point four-five"" nor ""point forty-five."" You drop the ""point"" when you speak about ammo sizes: it's ""three-fifty-seven,"" not ""point three-five-seven"" (.357)... it's ""three-eighty ACP,"" not ""point three-eight-zero ACP"" (.380 ACP.) .30-08 cartridges would be pronounced ""thirty-ought-eight,"" just to add to the confusion.

If you hear ""y point xx,"" it's generally used with metric units. ""7.62mm ammo"" would thus be ""seven point six-two ammo,"" but this is **not** referencing caliber.

**Edit:** just for giggles and to make things even less clear... bullet calibers are often referred to by a caliber number that is **not** the actual diameter of the bullet. Example: the bullet found in a .38 Special cartridge is **not** actually 0.38"" in diameter. It is actually 0.357"" - 0.358"" in diameter, typically. This is why, if you own a .357 revolver (like I do) you can fire either .357 or .38 ammo from it. However, you generally can't go the other way... revolvers specifically chambered for a .38 cannot accept a .357 cartridge (the .357 is a longer cartridge, even though they have the same diameter.)",2016-04-25 17:27:50+00:00,d2grxh5,4.0,t1_d2go2bj,5033.0,ManyATrueNerd

This is also bullshit. Not all worldly men are cheaters or disloyal to their spouses; far from it. Guess what? Women also cheat (though statistically at a lower ratio). Putting it all on the men is wrong. [Here's](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/03/22/how-common-is-cheating-infidelity-really/) some real data about cheating.

The [rates of domestic violence](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/domestic_violence/resources/statistics.html) in this nation are WAY THE FUCK TOO HIGH, but to hint (through association with the earlier statement that ""worldly marriages *always* end in divorce..."") that worldly men are always abusive is a rank, disgusting lie. Also, spousal abuse goes both ways: while it's more common for men to victimize women, 36% of domestic physical assaults are women-on-men violence. 1.3 million women and 835,000 men are victims of domestic violence annually in the US. Compare this combined number (2,175,000 victims) to the overall population of the US (318,900,000) and only about 0.68% of the population is involved in domestic violence. Still way too high, but let's keep things in perspective... out of 1000 people, only 7 people suffer from domestic violence.

Anecdotal experience time:

[Who knows what the rates are among Jehovah's Witnesses?](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/divorce.php) It certainly wouldn't profit the Society to publish that information, even if they collected it. However, it seems that most JW marriages face the same trials that ""worldly"" marriages do. It seems that the rates of divorce are about as common among JW's as they are among their ""wicked"" counterparts. I knew of at least three relationships in my last Kingdom Hall (out of about 180 people) which were abusive (as in, cops were called out to their homes.) One of those marriages was an elder and his wife, and a second one was a ministerial servant and his wife. Rank hath its privileges, but beating the shit out of your wife isn't supposed to be one.

My first marriage was between two Jehovah's Witnesses (so was my second, for that matter). That first marriage was a shambles from the beginning. While I never cheated, nor did I ever abuse my exwife, the same cannot be said in reverse. I know for certain of at least three affairs she had (I suspected two more but had no real proof). When she would get angry with me, it frequently devolved into physical strikes against me. The mental abuse I suffered was appalling. The only reason I kept at that poisonous relationship was due to the same problem any abuse victim seems to have: I thought I somehow deserved the treatment. Add to that the twisted notion that I needed to keep the marriage going to be a ""good little Witness and for God's sake."" It was only after the birth of my daughter that I began to change my outlook, because that little girl *didn't* deserve to be in that situation. It took me a while afterwards to fully realize what I had been involved in (it took a relationship with a pretty damned good woman, in fact, for me to begin to realize what a healthy relationship was all about.)

Marriage is tough sometimes. Sometimes it fails. Sometimes it becomes poisonous, or even starts off that way. However, Jehovah's Witnesses don't have some magical protection just because they are religious; they face the same problems and failures that the society around them faces. If the marriage is bad and is causing harm, then it's far better to end it and get away from that person. Guess what? *Sometimes divorce is a good thing.*

597,"I get what you are saying, but the difference is whether or not the copy was legally paid for. The library or private user has paid for their copy of the book (or in the library's case, the donor of the book paid for the copy). However, neither the user nor the library has any legal right to *make copies and then distribute said copies* of that work. That right is the sole province of the publisher and copyright holder (who is normally the author, but in this case is not.)

Once you cross that line of making a copy and then freely distributing it, then you are committing a crime both on both the distributor's part and the receiver's part. There are moral arguments both pro and con for it, but the legalities of it are pretty firm.

This isn't even a ""fine line of separation"" argument. The line is clear, is backed up by decades of legal precedent, and is clearly delineated in the laws of many nations.

It's all in how the user got their copy. Was it a legal copy, or was it illegal?

Again, it's not something that I completely agree with in this case. I'm just making the argument that no matter how we try to sugar coat it with a veneer of morality, the law is clear and we are committing a crime when we break it, no matter our reasons.

I personally find it less objectionable that someone like /u/PorkyFree downloads something illegally, and then attempts to make recompense to the rights-holders, than that they should download it illegally and make no attempt to provide royalties on it. However, in this I'm splitting hairs: I don't really find it that objectionable when /u/cappytan-exjw gets a copy of an out-of-print book illegally and without bothering to compensate the rights-holder in this particular case. In either case it's really none of my business how they got their copies; that's between them, the book owners, and the authorities (if they really give a damn about it at all). I tend to fall on the side of the argument that says that the book should be available to everyone and that since the rights-holder isn't making it available (especially given the ample avenues available to her today) then you get it however you can.

To be clear: I'm not making a moral argument either for or against downloading this book. I don't give a damn about it (and I really hope no one ever asks me to justify my mp3 music collection.) However, the legal status of lending libraries, used book sales, user lending, and illegal copies is pretty cut-and-dry (as is the legal status of my music... thank you Pandora, Spotify, and Apple Music Radio for giving me the opportunity to legally access the same music.)",2016-03-30 14:37:58+00:00,d1j33m3,5.0,t1_d1j204b,1619.0,exjw
598,"&gt; Do you also make a donation to the copyright holder when you lend one from library?

Not the same thing at all.

The copy of a book that is in the library is bought and paid for. That copy's price has already been delivered to the publishing house and the author. It doesn't matter how many times it is read or how many people read it; that particular copy has already generated money for the writer. Libraries are money sinks for publishers because of this, however 

An electronic copy that is purchased (for example, Kindle editions) is likewise paid for and the money has been delivered to the distributing parties. If I give my Kindle to a friend to read, then no matter how many people I hand it to, that particular copy has been paid for. I can pass my Kindle around to a thousand people, and I am still within the bounds of both moral and legal propriety as long as I'm not copying and forwarding the electronic copy itself.

If I download an illegal copy and make no purchase of it, especially when the copyright owner has declared his/her umbrage at such things, then I'm guilty of both transgressing moral and legal guidelines. We can argue the morality of whether or not this constitutes stealing, whether or not it's for the greater good, etc., but we are still guilty of committing a crime (no matter how insignificant a crime it might be in this case, or how justified we might feel in making it.) This is still considered piracy under many (most?) legal codes.

Mind you, I personally don't give a damn whether or not someone has downloaded *Crisis of Conscience* illegally or not. I tend to side with the moral argument that it should have already been made available by the rights holder, that there are ample avenues of distributing it (and which would net her more profit than using publishing houses which are **so** 1990's), and that it does more good for exJW's to understand the inner working of the WTBTS than to protect her copyright. Personally, from what little I have heard of the situation, I think the copyright holder is kind of a wanker, so I don't really give a damn about her or her rights. That said, I have a legal copy of the book and paid good money for it through Amazon (yay, used book loopholes! Now I have a legal copy, AND she doesn't get the royalties on it!)

But you still can't equate someone donating money to the copyright holder as a salve to a... crisis of conscience... over downloading an illegal copy of a book to a person who is lent one from a library.

599,"To piggy-back: in science, a theory is ***FACT.*** It's what you have after data collection, testing, re-testing, and more testing still. It's what is left when dozens, hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of scientists **independently** test and verify one another's results.

Just a few other theories that are factual, considered by most people as factual, and have been proven true time and time again: the Theory of Gravity, Germ Theory, Orbital Theory, General Theory of Relativity, the Pythagorean Theorem (still going strong after 2500 years, woot!)... and this is a tiny portion of the theories that govern scientific knowledge. Without them, we wouldn't understand things that work for us everyday: how diseases work and spread, how to keep GPS and communications satellites in orbit, how to construct a car, how to create medicines to control sickness, how the universe around us works.

The nice thing is, though, that if you can come up with verifiable proof that a scientific theory is wrong, then either the theory is revised, or it is scrapped. In almost 200 years time, the Theory of Evolution has been revised as we've come to understand natural processes better... but the core of it, the basic parts of it, have been independently verified over and over again, among several different scientific disciplines (and is indirectly or directly responsible for many of the biological scientific advances... such as medicine... that we've come to enjoy today.)

Think of that for a moment. Almost 200 years of thought, research, empirical data collection, arguments, fights, nay-sayers, religious pushback, and the theory is still running strong. A scientist would be firmly placed in the history books for centuries if he could somehow debunk evolution (realistic, fact-based debunking, not this tin-foil hat, superstitious bullshit that the likes of Ken Hamm and Ray Comfort try to do.) Science isn't afraid of questions. It embraces them. Even if the answer you come up with is wrong, you learned something to benefit the burgeoning data that science draws from.

My first wife had a lot of hangups from her family and her own mental illness, whereas my second wife has a very healthy view of sex and is pretty adventurous (and was even when she was a JW).

All that said, most JW's I knew and conversed with about sex had much more pedestrian sex lives than my second wife and I did. Hearing some of the gossip from the sisters who would discuss that stuff in field service car groups (you ladies talked about much more interesting things than the men did) made us both appreciative that we were both pretty open to sex play. Pretty much the only stuff we wouldn't do while in the organization was adding more people to the mix. Just about anything that can be done between two people was fair game, even if we did have problems with guilty consciences from some of it, especially when the WT article or the public talk that week was about the propriety of sex (and the talk I had to give on a Sunday regarding sex and it's place in marriage... we broke most of the rules, and I glossed over much of that part of the talk so as not to be too horrible a hypocrite.)

Now that we are both out of the organization, our sex lives have gotten a bit better. No guilt for sex acts is wonderful.

&gt; 8 Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.”
&gt; 
&gt; They did so, 9 and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew.

630,"&gt; My wife feels similarly. She feels that without ""Da Troof"" she wouldn't be alive today and that she might have that DGAF attitude as well if she lost her faith.

I just don't get that. I've heard it said by various people: ""Oh, it it weren't for *---insert religion of choice here---*, then I'd go right off the rails,"" but I don't understand the mentality. It's like that person is saying: ""Hey hubby, just so you know, if it weren't for those old geezers up at Bethel, I'd totally be throwing my genitals in the face of every man I saw out in public.""

If the only thing keeping you from cheating on your spouse is a religious leader telling you it's wrong, then there isn't much hope for your marriage. You'll find something to justify cheating. The same thing for any other moral quandary... if you need to be forced to be moral, then you aren't a moral person.

We choose our morality on a host of different things, but a person does not need religion in order to be a moral person. Hell, morality is simply the standards of the culture you live in, coupled with your own personal standards as well as those of whatever life partners you have. It is largely subjective on an individual person's outlook, their upbringing, their cultural norms, and various other environmental factors. Morality can change, depending on a host of factors. Also, what's moral for one person may not necessarily be moral for another person (except for various things which seem to cross cultural boundaries and almost seem to be wired into us for survival as a species.)

I don't buy into the idea that if it wasn't for the organization, that these people would somehow suddenly find themselves in a pit of debauchery and jumping into an orgy of hedonism (jumping into an orgy sounds like a lot of fun... like a mosh pit, only naked.).

The Watchtower Society hits most of the hallmarks of a cult according to the BITE model created by Steve Hassan (and based on other work by Robert Lifton and Margaret Singer). It is considered by many psychologists as a high control religion (a more politically correct term for cult.)

It's not quite as bad as some cults like Heaven's Gate or the Jim Jones group; it's more on par with Scientology or Mormonism. It's still a destructive cult (it destroys family groups and social structures if you go against the Society's dictates, and their stances on things like blood transfusions and psychological help endangers people's lives who are in need of both).

I kind of got the magic thing, since JW's teach that magic is Satanic in origin, even if I thought that was total bullshit (it's freaking make-believe.) The point of his that really blew my mind was that speaking, anthropomorphic animals were also Satanic... because of the serpent in the Garden of Eden (which JW's also teach was Satan himself.) Thus, any cartoon with talking animals was evil... as were any books, any toys, any games with anthropomorphic animals.

650,"It is dumb. If you begin studying with them, the literature they use is specifically designed to channel your questions into certain areas. The study material (generally books they publish) has its own preloaded questions and the book study conductor is supposed to keep the discussion on track (some are obviously better at this than others.) The study conductor isn't even aware of this normally; they've been indoctrinated into this method of teaching and indoctrination themselves.

If you come up with a question they aren't able to answer, then they deflect it until a time when they can research it. Most questions have been asked of various members over time, so most have an answer... for those that they can't answer, they generally tell you that you should basically put a pin in the question and it will be answered at some (nebulous) future date. Eventually you get to the point where your question, which may have been completely valid, no longer seems as important as it once was, and you get used to the idea of suppressing it.

If you begin to wake up in the organization and start asking serious questions, then it's seen as a sign of spiritual weakness and needs to be addressed. Addressing it takes various forms, but falls into three general categories: 1. either you suppress your doubts and questions and toe to company line, or 2. you are marked as spiritually weak and other JW's (your only social contacts outside of work for most members) including family begin to distance themselves from you and possibly shun you, or 3. you are disfellowshipped from the congregation (excommunicated), shunned by family and friends, and branded an apostate (basically a mentally diseased follower of Satan in their eyes.)

654,"It used to be (and still is, I believe) that the congregations had funds in their own, local, banks. Menlo Park is pretty typical of how they handled things to destroy congregation independence, though it was an extreme case because Menlo Park had a couple of elders with backbones and the intellect to see what was happening. They slowly introduced letters designed to get the elder bodies to surrender what little autonomy they had, and had the BOE's (bodies of elders) sign over ownership of the Kingdom Halls to the Society itself, all under the guise of loyalty to Jehovah and the organization (given the amount of indoctrination and influence the Watchtower higher-ups have, this wasn't too difficult to do in most cases.) Although I find their tactics reprehensible, I have to tip my hat at the sheer mastery they displayed over manipulating and forcing the congregations to give up their rights, money, and autonomy.

Rebellion amongst the more independent elders was swiftly crushed, either by their ""loyal"" fellows or by the circuit overseers who would censure them for questioning WTBTS dictates. In more extreme cases where elders balked, they were simply removed and replaced on the BOE (this is essentially what happened in Menlo Park for example... grossly oversimplified, but it's the gist of the events.) If someone were foolish enough to continue to resist, then they would be disfellowshipped for something; likely apostasy since that's easy enough to trump up charges for and if you are standing against the Society you are automatically guilty of it per Watchtower doctrine.

Mostly it happened slowly over time, and with the willing participation of dupes in the elder bodies who wanted to be loyal to ""God's arrangement."" The amount of pressure put on the elders, and through them to the individual publishers, is pretty great. No one wants to be disloyal to the organization or to God, so they agree to the arrangements.

* *Examining the Scriptures Daily 2011 Aug 18 p.83*

""Satan was the first creature to turn apostate. **Modern-day apostates display characteristics similar to those of the Devil. Their mind may be poisoned** by a critical attitude toward individuals in the congregations, Christian elders, or the Governing Body. Some apostates oppose the use of the divine name, Jehovah. They are not interested in learning about Jehovah or in serving him. **Like their father, Satan,** apostates target people of integrity. (John 8:44) No wonder servants of Jehovah avoid all contact with them!""
____

* *Watchtower 2011 Jul 15 p.11*

**""Apostates “quietly” bring their ideas into the congregation, like criminals** who secretly bring things into a country. Apostates use “counterfeit words.” This means that they say things that make their false ideas sound true, like criminals who make false documents look real. **They try to get as many people as possible to believe their “deceptive teachings.”** Peter also said that they like twisting the Scriptures. They explain Bible verses in the wrong way to make others believe their ideas. (2 Peter 2:1, 3, 13; 3:16) Apostates do not care about us. If we follow them, we will leave the road to everlasting life. 
... **The Bible says that apostates are mentally diseased** and that they use their teachings to make others think like them. (1 Timothy 6:3, 4) Jehovah is like that good doctor. He clearly tells us to stay away from false teachers. We must always be determined to follow his warning.

What must we do to avoid false teachers? We do not speak to them or invite them into our houses. We also do not read their books, watch them on television, read what they write on the Internet, or add our own comments about what they write on the Internet. Why are we so determined to avoid them? First of all, it is because we love “the God of truth.” So we do not want to listen to false teachings that go against the truth in God’s Word.""
____
* *Watchtower 2004 Feb 15 p.28* 

""It would be a mistake to think that you need to listen to apostates or to read their writings to refute their arguments. **Their twisted, poisonous reasoning can cause spiritual harm and can contaminate your faith like rapidly spreading gangrene.** (2 Timothy 2:16, 17) Rather, imitate God's response to apostates. Job said of Jehovah: ""Before him no apostate will come in."" - Job 13:16."" 
____
* *Watchtower 1993 November 1 p.19*

**""True Christians** share Jehovah's feelings toward such apostates; they are not curious about apostate ideas. On the contrary, they **""feel a loathing"" toward those who have made themselves God's enemies,** but they leave it to Jehovah to execute vengeance.""

""For one thing, some of the apostate literature presents falsehoods by means of ""smooth talk"" and ""counterfeit words."" (Romans 16:17, 18; 2 Peter 2:3) What would you expect from the table of demons? ... **Those who have continued to feed at Satan's spiritual table, the table of demons, will be forced to attend a literal meal, no, not as partakers, but as the main course-to their destruction!""**

After I explained some of the other ideas I wanted to incorporate, the artist came up with a drawing that was almost exactly what I had in mind; in some ways it was better; she had colors that she wanted to add when I was just going to go with a black and white design. I wanted color, but I wasn't sure how long it would take or how difficult it would be, so I was planning on adding it later; I was also having a difficult time of deciding exactly what colors to use.

Still, it took me three years. I bounced around through differing styles and other ideas (spooky scenery, demons/aliens, nautical themes, combinations of all these together).

______________________

Look at this fucking mess. It's not a real article. It's a god damned advertisement piece for a snake oil salesman. Look at the authorship of the piece:  Thunder Energies Corp. January 19, 2016 7:00 PM

The fucking company trying to trademark and patent the ""revolutionary Santilli telescope with concave lenses"" is the one writing this drivel. Check out their claims prior to this new, revolutionary piece of horse manure:

&gt; Thunder Energies Corporation has previously presented confirmations of the apparent existence of antimatter galaxies, antimatter asteroids and antimatter cosmic rays detected in preceding tests.

Are you fucking kidding me? They are claiming they have discovered *antimatter galaxies?!?!?* [Here's](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-we-know-that-dista/) an **actual** article quote dealing with this kind of tripe:

&gt; Steve Naftilan of the Joint Science Department at The Claremont Colleges answers:

&gt; ""When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate each other and the mass is converted into energy--specifically, into gamma-rays. If a distant galaxy were made of antimatter, it would constantly be producing gamma-rays as it encountered the matter in the intergalactic gas clouds that exist throughout galaxy clusters.

&gt; ""We do not see any steady stream of gamma-rays coming from any source in the sky. Therefore, astronomers conclude that there are not occasional 'rogue' galaxies made of antimatter. If there is any large amount of antimatter in the universe, it must encompass at least an entire galaxy cluster, and probably a supercluster. Once might postulate the existence of such antimatter superclusters, but then one would be faced with the problem of coming up with a mechanism that, shortly after the big bang, would have separated these now-gigantic clumps of antimatter from the neighboring clumps of mater. No such mechanism has yet been envisioned.""

While scientists are loathe to definitively state that it's an impossibility (after all, the Universe is kind of a big thing and just perhaps...), given the fact that there is a lot of matter flying around out there and an antimatter galaxy would be constantly bombarded by dust, gas, rocks, etc. and we don't see the gamma ray bursts from impacts between matter and antimatter, it seems a pretty safe bet that there isn't a galaxy made of the stuff. If there were, scientists would be positively ejaculating about the discovery. I mean, they're currently sporting tented trousers and wet panties over the fact that we've finally found gravity waves in space... antimatter galaxies would have them gushing and squirting all over the place like a cheap porn actress.

Then you look up information on the shyster heading up the very same company that is lauding Dr. Santilli, who created this revolutionary new telescope. Oh wait... the head of the company is the very same Dr. Ruggero Santilli? Well, that adds a new twist on the story, and not a good twist either. Here's some info on [this whack-a-doo.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruggero_Santilli) The fuckwit merits his own Wikipedia page. He's a god damned snake oil salesman of the old school type of con artist.

One last thing: Thunder Energies Corporation is located in Tarpon Springs. I live not too far from Tarpon Springs, and have actually spent some time there (hell, I lived there once upon a time.)

It's sponges, hard working fishermen, some really nice historical homes, Greek orthodox churches, and some damned fine baklava and kefta. It's a bit short on scientific institutions though: no research institutions, no major universities (though they have a small campus offshoot from St. Petersburg College).

For instance, if you were listed in the voting rolls as a Republican, you could help select who the Republican nomination for president would go to. Once that selection is made and it's time to vote for the actual President, you'd be able to vote either Republian, Democrat, or for whatever other candidate you wanted to go for.

Party affiliation allows you the opportunity to participate in the party nomination process in states that have limited or closed primaries (most states fall into one of these two categories). States that have open primaries are basically a free-for-all, as I understand it.

In your case, unless you change party affiliation before the closing date in your state, you probably won't be able to vote in the party nomination process (the primaries), so you won't be able to help Bernie get on top of Hillary (ahem).

702,"Registering for Selective Service wasn't exciting or anything. It wasn't scary at all. It's a simple little form, and (when I did it) just had to be turned in at the post office (this is way back in the dawn of time during the 90's, when we used dinosaur blood for ink and rode to war on the back of Tyrannosaurus Rex). I remember thinking at the time that if a draft were called that I might have to go to prison instead, but it didn't overly worry me as far as I can remember.

The United States isn't too keen on the idea of a draft nowadays. They learned some bitter lessons from Korea and Vietnam. That's not to say it's impossible to have a draft enacted; in the event of a massive war, I'm certain it would be done if manpower requirements weren't being met. However, most of the military conflicts we've seen since Vietnam have been far smaller and more focused in scope. We have a volunteer military more than capable of handling the needs of modern warfare.

Of course, should things erupt between major nations (such as Russia or China) then that all goes out the window. On the other hand, believe it or not, warfare is becoming less common as time goes on. The number of wars might have increased during the Cold War as proxy battles were fought between the West (Europe and the USA) and the USSR, but since the fall of the Soviet Union they've been decreasing (maybe proxy wars will increase again in the future, but that's not the case currently.) Plus, war deaths have dramatically fallen since the end of WWII. All of this means less likelihood of a draft in the future.

703,"&gt; Does it originate from the US fundies who were/are all waiting for the apocalypse and counting their last of everything?

No. It actually gets its name from a photo-essay by Magnum photographer Robert Capa in the early 50's, describing the ""unknown generation"" right after World War II. The name didn't stick then, because that generation got the nickname ""baby boomers"" since there were huge increases in population attributed to the end of WWII hostilities and the normal human reaction to the end of war (sex everywhere!)

It was popularized in the 90's for my generation because it dealt with the kids born to the baby boomers and adopted the lost or unknown generation motif that Capa had earlier applied to what was later named ""the baby-boom generation."" A lot of articles were written in the 90's dealing with the supposedly unknown qualities of my generation, hence ""X"".

722,"Good. I wasn't trying to be offensive towards you, but there are a lot of things in the natural world that are pretty horrific (to us) and that we often don't consider when we think about deities.

As for why certain things evolved to do things in certain ways, normally it provides them some sort of advantage in their particular niche. A lot of it falls under the umbrella of ""We don't know,"" but that's a good thing in science. Not knowing in science just means that we get do explore and figure things out.

Why do ducks rape? I am not 100% on this, but I've read that it's because of population pressures. Ducks typically mate once a year and only have one mating partner for that year. Thus, if the population is imbalanced sexually... if for example there are more males than females, then the unattached male ducks will ""rape"" the females in order to impregnate them  (it should be noted that calling it rape is anthropomorphizing traits to animals for which that term may not really apply). It might also be noted that this activity makes sure that there is ample genetic variation withing successive duck generations, so it might give ducks an advantage in species survival.

Why do female spiders (and praying mantises!) eat their male partners? From an evolutionary standpoint it makes a great deal of sense. The male has already impregnated her, and she is in need of an energy source in order to produce hundreds of eggs. That male is packed full of energy. Because they produce so many baby spiders (mantises) the pressure for any particular individual to live is not as high as it is with higher order animals like cats, dogs, primates. At least, I would assume that is the reason. I don't like spiders too much, so they aren't exactly something I'd research.

For some reason the article dealing with the worm/torture penis is blocked at my job, so I can't review it to see if it says anything about why this happens. However, they aren't the only species that dies in procreation... think of spawning salmon. [**Here's**](http://baynature.org/2013/11/21/pacific-salmon-die-spawning/) a pretty good article on why salmon die after spawning.

A lot of it boils down to available resources and competition for those resources. When we boil down all life to its most basic parts, it's a self-replicating mechanism that utilizes energy sources for the purpose of survival and replication. That's essentially it, whether we're a cellular organism or a human being.

Think of this though: for us, female praying mantises decapitating their mate and then devouring his still twitching body is pretty horrifying. For them, perhaps the thought (if they are/were capable of thinking) of sexual intercourse with the same mate over and over again is likewise disturbing... after all, we're being really inefficient and selfish in not sharing our nutrients and chemical energy to our mates so that they can use it for the formation and birthing of our offspring.

I'll still take not being eaten though. Well, not being *literally* eaten. Figuratively...",2016-02-04 19:51:18+00:00,cznx0w4,3.0,t1_cznvdc8,2271.0,exjw
723,"Quick word of warning: I'm probably going to be offensive below. Just thought I'd mention that in advance. Not to you personally, mind you... I have no beef with you. However, if you have a deep love of a Creator, any Creator, then I'm about to piss all over your floor.

I'm going to [link a pic](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/6/005/06d/2fe/1e61208.jpg) of something the Greek philosopher Epicurus once stated. This is actually a pretty polite counter argument to the one you pose above.

&gt; The Creator plops us down here, gives us the basics as far as raw resources and intelligence goes and then sees what we are made of and how we ourselves can solve the problems. 

Here's the rub: if there is a Creator of any type and he just makes everything up and then ignores what happens, then he's guilty of criminal negligence at best or of intentional infliction of pain and misery at worst.

Let's say that I create [a wood and metal contraption](http://ec-dejavu.ru/images/g/guillotine_1.jpg) that has a razor sharp, weighted blade that quickly drops through a framework with a hole in it the approximate size of the average person's head, and then leave that contraption on a playground typically used by small grade-school children in some kind of ""experiment"" that those children are supposed to somehow avoid it or fix things so that it cannot affect them. Now, let's say these kids are your typical curious little primates, and start fucking around with my little experiment.

What kind of person am I for creating a situation, plopping it down with a bunch of innocents, and then sitting back, taking notes, and just watching what happens? Given our laws in most nations, I'm probably going to prison for what happens. Some people might even lose their heads over what I've done.

If your Creator stacks the deck against humanity and creates shit like bone cancer, or tapeworms, or wet macular degeneration, or diabetes, or ducks that rape other ducks with prehensile penises, or spiders that engage in sex and then devour their mates in order to harvest their body's energy and nutrients for the creation of eggs, or worms that impregnate other worms by literally ripping their genitals apart with spikes and eventually killing them, then your Creator is a psychopathic mother fucker and deserves no consideration whatsoever. He has created a system in which there are horrific things happening, all just so we can figure them out? Yeah... he's a sociopath of the worst sort then.

I don't care if this is all so that ""WE, AS A HUMAN RACE, are SUPPOSED to BE THE ONES FIXING THINGS."" This is an absolutely awful and horrible abandonment of his responsibility to his creation then. I did not impregnate my wife, she did not give birth to our children, only for us to throw them outside the house and say ""Welp, time for you to fix things up so you can survive. Hope you figure out how to get water in three days, little infant, or you're going to die of thirst."" I would be a terrible parent if I did that.

Now, all the above is only if we assume there is a Creator of some type.

&gt; Why do we have to blame a creator for bad stuff WE do?? And I am not saying to blame a ""Satan"" figure either, but **take responsibility for bad stuff that humans do to each other, and try to fix it.** Maybe our purpose is not to WORSHIP a creator, but to **be good stewards of this Earth and each other.** We are a RACE of problem solvers - I think we could be doing a better job and **not just blame some invisible entity on all of society's ills...**

Highlights are mine.

I agree with what you write above. We should spend less time assigning blame to a Creator. However, I say this because I'm an atheist. I don't believe in a Creator because I see no evidence for one. It wouldn't do much good for me to attempt to blame a Creator for the ills of this world if one doesn't exist... I might as well assign the blame to a purple, rainbow farting unicorn, since it would be about as applicable as the idea of God. I can, however, assign blame for lack of progress on religious organizations as it is in their best interests to control humanity and impede progressive thought. As the world of science and knowledge about the universe expands, the kingdom of gods contracts, and that is fought against tooth and nail by the religious. Just ask Galileo, Copernicus, or Darwin.

Personally, I believe humanity has the obligation and responsibility to improve our lives and seek the answers to the problems facing us by helping one another and working with each other to accomplish these things. It's only through the efforts of human beings that we can effect change of any sort. We've done a pretty piss poor job of it in some ways (we've screwed up on climate change), but we've really excelled in others (for instance, antibiotics are kind of a good thing.) I regard myself as a modern humanist:

&gt; From Google Search's definition: Humanist beliefs stress the potential value and goodness of human beings, emphasize common human needs, and seek solely rational ways of solving human problems.

The thing is, the reliance on any kind of deity is a bad thing. Most people who rely on God to solve problems do two things: they deny their responsibility to the world to change those things because God will fix it all eventually, and they refuse to live life in the present because they are hoping (generally) for some kind of afterlife or reward. No one is out there and going to help us. To paraphrase a statement made by Benjamin Franklin, God helps those who help themselves. In this case, the only god that will help humanity is humanity itself. If that doesn't happen... well, we won't be the first or last species of animal that went extinct on Earth. I'll deeply regret that however, and hope it doesn't come in my lifetime or the lifetimes of any of my descendants for the foreseeable future.

We have, as you stated, a responsibility for the bad stuff we do. We also have a responsibility to do good things for one another. Creators don't matter much in the face of that.

732,"It's not so bad in my immediate locale. Tampa consistently scores in the top 15 secular cities in the country, and normally places in the top ten. Stating that I'm atheist in outlook will still get me into arguments, but it's not quite as bad as other Southern places where I might actually have to worry about businesses refusing my service or even have to worry about violence. However, drive two miles outside the city limits and you hit parochial, Deep-South conservative Florida. The kind of Deep South that loves Confederate flags and thinks that perhaps segregation wasn't such a bad situation after all. God, guns, and beer.

Unfortunately, what liberal areas Florida has are concentrated around the metropolitan areas, and unfair weight is given the conservative rural areas in our politics... which means that my home state is a red (conservative) state.

*Note: I'm not saying that the US is better than anyone else below. I'm just trying to communicate how there seems to be a disconnect between how other nationalities view us (particularly what I hear from Europeans) the monolithic view they have of Americans, and the reality that is the American people.*

The United States is deeply complicated in nature. Sure, we're one nation, but we're also the size of half a continent. Many of our states are the same size as the largest European countries. Take places like France and Germany and think about the varied types of outlooks and values that people have there. Now multiply those nations several times, and apply those same varied peoples to each of those multiplied nations; now you have something approaching the USA.

We have over 360 million people here. We're the third most populous country in the world, but our population density isn't even remotely close to filling our national boundaries, unlike many nations. For those of us in urban centers, that may be hard to believe given the grid-locked traffic at rush hour, but one just needs to see a [satellite image of the US at night](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/712129main_8247975848_88635d38a1_o.jpg) to see how much empty space we have available to us; and that's just the continent. I'm not including Alaska or Hawaii, or our various territories and dependencies. The most populous nation in Europe, Germany, has a little over 80 million. That's only about 10x the size of our largest **city.** Granted, it takes three of our states to equal the same population as Germany, but think about that: Germany is only as large (population wise) as **three states.**

I'm going to make the violation of sweeping broad generalizations together here. It's stereotyped that the British don't like the French, and vice-versa. Neither of them are particularly fond of the Germans. No one likes the Dutch with their wooden shoes of clopping clogs. [Belgium is the rudest word in the entire Universe.](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Belgium) Is Luxembourg really a country, or is it a county that developed delusions of grandeur?

Here, New York thinks it's the best thing since sex was discovered. Oregon and Washington are high as kites and filled with hippies, hipsters, white supremacists, liberals, tech companies, and /u/AgroSaxon. California is the biggest kid on the block in the west. Florida is California Light, but without the liberal bent of the state. Montana is a bunch of conservative cowboys. Texas somehow thinks they have the biggest dick in the entire world. New Mexico is... well, if you've seen *Breaking Bad* then you know what New Mexico is... endless beach, no ocean, and meth everywhere. Fuck that... meth is *everywhere* here. Everyone hates New York, especially the New Yorkers (until they transplant elsewhere, and then they are busy trying to turn the places they move and retire to into the shit hole that is New York.) Washington, D.C. is just... well, it's weird. That comes from having so many assholes in one small geographic location that the collective puckering of their sphincters and the farts that they issue all at once when talking actually bends space-time into shapes it was never meant to be in.

Think of all those geopolitical tangles and knots between European nations. Now, take the entire European continent and compare it to the single nation of the United States of America. Territorial size-wise, they are comparable, though Europe as a whole (the entire frickin' continent!) is only about double our population size. Our situation is simplified in that we (the US) are *one national polity*, but we are still *50 very different states, each with its own unique culture and outlook.*

&gt; The Meeting Situation
&gt; 
&gt; At times there may be some doubt whether the situation is a crossing or a head-on meeting. In case of doubt, you should assume that it is a meeting situation, in which neither vessel has a clear-cut ""right-of-way,"" and each must act to avoid the other. Each vessel in a meeting situation must alter course to starboard so that each will pass on the port side of the other. At night, you will recognize a head-on meeting situation if you see both red and green side lights at the same time.

-based on The Rules of the Road, published by the U. S. Government Printing Office

Unless the boater purposely tried to run the guy down, the jet skiier was at fault here. If the boat's angle of attack was high enough, then the pilot might not have even seen the jet ski beyond a certain distance. He may have been attempting collision avoidance, hoping that the jet ski driver would follow standard marine rules.

Even if the boater did purposely try to run the guy down... it'll be hard to prove that since the jet skiier was still trying to do something that violated boating rules. The boater has a better defense here.",2016-02-03 01:40:30+00:00,czlqy8t,1.0,t3_43woen,11611.0,rage

That can really screw you up. Your A1C's, which indicate your average glucose levels for your doctor's use, are going to get all screwed up. This means the doc is going to make adjustments to your meds and glucose intake that aren't necessary or healthy.

Plus, you're playing around with insulin overdosing. You're increasing the amount of glucose your cells take in; you're decreasing the amount of energy available (that same glucose) for needed and necessary cellular function. The end results of this, should your glucose levels drop too low too quickly, can range from concentration problems, to seizures, to unconsciousness, to potential death. Fucking around with your insulin dosage is idiotic, and can lead to lasting harm. You know this. You wrote it in your post.

This is a terrible method of getting out of a meeting early. It's irresponsible. It's damaging to your body and overall health. It's the kind of thing that builds up over time and causes permanent harm. You have Type I Diabetes. This is a life threatening disease. You don't fuck around with life threatening diseases just to make things a little more convenient for yourself in a temporary situation.

This is fucking stupid behavior. This is completely asinine. This is not, not, NOT something to act proud of. It is remarkably short sighted, juvenile, and immature behavior.

I don't normally chastise people in this subreddit. In the three years I've been a member here, I've seen some amazingly stupid and self-destructive shit. This one is probably in the top five dumbest things I've seen in here. Normally I'm a live-and-let-live kind of guy. Normally I let people act like dickheads if they want except in the more egregious behaviors... after all, who am I to tell them how to behave. However, this is something that can fucking kill you and can certainly lead to lasting damage if it doesn't. You have Type I Diabetes... the damage you do now just adds up over time and continues increasing.

I'm not just talking out of my ass here, either. I've got a kid with Type I Diabetes. I've been dealing with this disease for about ten years now. Don't be a complete fucktard and do this shit.

I was 37 when I went back to school during the peak of the recession (I'm 41 now to put that into perspective). I couldn't find work, so I maxed out my student loans to help contribute to the household and to try to retool my career path for something I could find work in.

Kids gotta eat, man. Bills gotta get paid. The electric company doesn't give a damn that you aren't making any money when they decide to turn off your electricity.

792,"&gt; I've used My____Lab is actually my favorite because each question has a lot of associated resources that are actually extremely helpful. I've used it for Math, Chemistry, and IT so far and have done extremely well in those classes.

My Math Lab did a very good job on the homework and lecture sessions, I thought. Honestly, the algebra lectures (video recorded) were excellent. It was only the quizzes and tests that I had problems with; there was invariably 2-3 questions (out of 20-30) that would count a correct answer as incorrect. Granted, this was in 2010-2011, so they may have rectified the problems since then. I guess I shouldn't bitch too much, as I still passed the class with a 3.0 and it wasn't in a subject that I'm strong in.

You had an inexperienced professor. That sucks when it happens in a science course; I got lucky there and had pretty good profs in my sciences. I had an inexperienced professor for American History, but that wasn't such a big deal as his tests were pretty good, it was just his lecturing that suffered (he was so young and nervous!)

Most of my community college profs have been pretty solid, actually; there was only one or maybe two that I didn't care for or who I would say weren't good teachers. We have several schools in our area, including one of the largest research universities in the nation, and most professors teach between my CC and the university.

814,"There are programs out there for most students. Here in the US we have student loans if nothing else; if you are going to community college then you can at least get an AA in something (I'd recommend heathcare as you can make a decent living off an AA degree in that field) without spending too much in loans. If you are below the poverty threshold for your family size, then you qualify for a Pell Grant, which doesn't need to be paid back. Most CC's won't need much, if anything, more than your Pell Grant to pay for tuition and books.

Student loan debt is no laughing matter, but as far as loans go it's got one of the cheapest interest rates out there. That doesn't mean it's easy to pay off... but it also doesn't have to kill you. You just need to be smart about how much you borrow, and how it's used. Some people will require more financial aid than others. This is why I state above that you need to get into the right kind of degree program... most of your STEM and healthcare degrees tend to result in better opportunities for higher paying jobs, but you need to do your research to see how the field's growth rates, pay rates, etc. stack up. Here in the States, you'd go to something like the Department of Labor's [Occupational Outlook Handbook](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/) for that information. While it's not concrete or set in stone, it gives you a general idea of what fields you should be looking at.

Caveats: not all STEM or medical fields are well paying, nor are they all projected for growth. For instance, aerospace engineers, though paid well, is projected to decline in growth due to lack of demand. Nuclear medicine technologists make good money, but are only projected to grow at a 2% rate, below national averages. You need to do your homework to find a field that pays decently and grows, but the website gives you tools to do that. Another caveat: this is estimated data, and it varies from location to location; job growth is a projected estimate (basically, they are guessing it will continue a past trend.) Nothing is determined for certain here.

First we stopped going to meetings and only called in. We would call in so that we could truthfully state (when the elders decided to ""encourage"" us) that we listened in on the meetings and so that our congregation attendance numbers wouldn't suffer for the CO's visit (we kept tabs of call-ins and included them in meeting attendance numbers, and since I was a servant at the time it was something I was concerned about.) Then, when we realized that as long as the phone was on mute no one could hear what we were doing at home, we began using the time we called in for other activities.

No, not those kinds of activities, you sick bastards. Geez, everything has to be about sex with some people around here (wait... that's me...) We were still ""in"" and believed in the existence of God to a large degree, and that would have been very naughty.

However, somehow we managed to justify to ourselves that we could put the phone on mute, turn on the speaker, and then have the meeting in the background while we took care of the kids and got the small ones ready for bed, or did housework, or took care of other things. Eventually, it got to the point that when we finished up with our nightly chores and the meeting was still running, that I would start playing Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, or Skyrim during the rest of the meetings.

833,"&gt; With the Temple destroyed and the prohibition on pronouncing The Name outside of the Temple, pronunciation of the Name fell into disuse. Scholars passed down knowledge of the correct pronunciation of YHVH for many generations, **but eventually the correct pronunciation was lost, and we no longer know it with any certainty.**

From the website [Judaism 101.](http://www.jewfaq.org/name.htm) There isn't complete certainty as to how the divine name was actually pronounced, but if anyone should know it, then I would assume the Jews would, since they basically started the whole religion. It would seem their most popular pronunciation today is Yahweh, but this isn't by any means uncontested:

&gt; Historian Flavius Josephus, who was born a kohein at a time when the pronunciation of the Name was still known, said that the name was four vowels (War of the Jews, Book V, Chapter 5), probably referring to the fact that each of the four consonants in the name can serve in Hebrew as a vowel or vowel marker.

860,"This is good advice that can be applied to more than just the dating game. When we find ourselves obsessing over the negative parts of our past, we tend to drive ourselves into a state in which we are hopeless and then helpless. This doesn't mean we shouldn't acknowledge the bad things that happened, or the negative stuff that occurred; after all, by ignoring the bad we cannot learn from it to avoid it in the future. However, there is a difference between acknowledging the things that came before and dwelling on them. Dwelling on them does nothing but send us into a cycle of despair. There is no healing in that.

In order to heal and learn, acknowledge the bad, but focus on what you learned and experienced that is positive. That is the stuff you want to use as a foundation to build upon. As you state, there are things that we learned and experienced in the organization that can help us. Those are things that can be built upon. Those are the things I want to keep. As you say, there are things that can be discarded as trash: the religious mumbo-jumbo, the guilt, the fear, the psychological fuckery... and it will take work to overcome these things. However, they CAN be overcome, as long as we stop dwelling on the negatives and allowing them to take over our lives. We need to make room for the positives.

I remember an illustration that I used to enjoy (specifically regarding stumbling, but it applies to other things as well): ""We all stumble. We all fall down from time to time. We all tumble down into the mud on the path of life; it's almost inevitable that we do this because we are human. What makes us a good person isn't avoiding falling, so much, but rather the choices we make after we trip. Do we get up and do our best to clean the mud off of ourselves, and then start walking again? Or do we sit in the mud, make squelching noises, and just lie there? Do we give up trying to get up?""

Focusing on the bad and negative aspects of our past is squelching in the mud. We can't clean it all off of us, but we can certainly get up out of it and try to continue walking on.",2016-01-19 15:17:31+00:00,cz3z1yn,2.0,t1_cz3qqe8,25015.0,exjw

I don't imagine the Society was in any hurry to finish the deal, but official agencies also take their time to approve plans, and there are a variety of reasons for that. Some of it is simple procrastination and laziness, but that is inherent in any bureaucratic structure, be it corporate or government. Most of it is just trying to make sure codes are met, the design is workable and functional, and above all that safety concerns are met. I do believe the Society's insistence on volunteer labor helped slow the process down, and that they were more concerned with Bethel II rather than keeping their word on a local (and to them, useless) park, but there were other issues as well.

I used to help design large-scale subdivisions (like, the size of small town type subdivisions with tens of thousands of residents.) The process for that was sometimes infuriatingly slow from the standpoint of the developer; after all, he wants to turn a profit asap. However, it takes time to design and get approvals, and then it takes more time to build. I think it used to take anywhere from 3-5 years total depending on size, and even then there would be parts of the subdivision that weren't done. One massive subdivision I worked on back in the early 2000's still hasn't been built out, and it's been almost 10 years since I worked on the design. That's actually one of the reasons I no longer work in civil design... jobs are hard to come by as developers are working on stuff that we designed 8-10 years ago that didn't get built when the housing market and development crashed.

Moses Maimonides was right. I wish more religious people understood that kind of concept.

I will give Judaism this: of all the existing religions in the world, they seem to be the most even-handed. They seem, like American Buddhism, to be more philosophical in many ways than most religions. I'm excluding orthodox Judaism from this though; they are as reactionary as any fundamentalist group, be it Muslim, Christian, Hindu, etc. Fundy's really suck ass.

&gt; I don't mind atheists AT ALL! My husband is one and I agree with most of it!

Funny thing... I once knew a guy who identified as a Jewish atheist. For him, Judaism was more a cultural thing; he didn't believe there was evidence for God though.

If I ever come across in some of my comments as an angry, militant atheist, then it's probably because on some level I am. I don't like what I see as the negative effect of religion on humanity today, and there are mountains of supporting evidence for that feeling. That being said, when people explore religion the way that I've seen you do, I respect and appreciate it (for whatever that's worth... it's not like my approval means anything, lol.) I might have the general attitude of Christopher Hitchens regarding religion, but there are some forms I find less objectionable than others, and you've managed to find a religious outlet that is more philosophical inquiry than hard-core faith and belief. Philosophy is awesome... bible thumping is not. Edit: I'd also like to add, being an atheist and braining people over the head with it, calling them stupid for believing in something

Mainstream Judaism is appealing on many levels. For one thing, I don't recall ever meeting a proselytizing Jew; I've never had one tell me ""Accept the Dreidel in your life or be damned!!!"" I've never had one tell me I'm going to hell for my belief or lack of belief. Granted, I'm not including orthodox Jewry in this; orthodox people of **any** religion tend to be fundamentalist, and fundamentalist religious people tend to be douches, as we've had plenty of experience with.

I'll say this for Judaism: it's definitely not a proselytizing religion. It's not inclusionary, it's exclusionary. The attitude of most Jews I've come across (few though they are) has been more along the lines of ""That's okay, we really don't want or need you to convert. No, really, it's all good... you probably should just believe whatever you want, and we'll just be over here playing with our dreidel and lighting our nine candles. No, no, no... we really don't want you to go to the trouble of conversion. Alright, since it's not getting through, let me be clear: go away and celebrate your Easter bunny, or whatever you guys do."" (I'm joking, of course.)

In all honesty, there is a lot about modern Judaism that attracts me. If I weren't so personally certain that there was no evidence for God, I could see myself gravitating towards it.

&gt; The reason the park hasn't been completed is because the CITY dragged their feet on approving the use of volunteers by the org.

This is New York we're talking about, and a public agency that is responsible for citizen safety.

1. New York has very strong unions and lobbies. The city has to explore whether utilizing volunteer labor in a public works project would violate existing legal agreements. If not, the city could be sued, which would be an irresponsible act on their part, leading to investigations, recriminations, and other assorted bullshit that could lead to all kinds of legal headaches and people losing their jobs. This process can take a while, especially since the Parks Department has other things they need to worry about, like that sanitary lift station that has a broken pump and is overflowing with solid waste, or that other park that has rabid wolverines infesting its bushes, or another park that has been subject to a group of furiously protesting and armed grandmothers who are angry over the lack of knitting stations. Additionally, because it deals with minutiae of legal matters, public safety, and various other things the approval process for **anything** by a public agency takes a long time; most agencies I work with have a 60-day window to review plans and make comments before getting them back to you, and they will generally (due to work load) take that entire period of time. This is by necessity... you don't want plans that have an impact on public safety to be rushed through an approval process. People get cranky when buildings and bridges collapse.

2. Volunteer labor is normally (for most applications) unskilled labor, and this is the perception most people would have of it. Now, I'm assuming that the marketing drawings that were attached to the article were indicating all new construction, and not just repurposing and refurbishing existing infrastructure. If that is the case, then we're not talking about resodding a field, which can be done with a few volunteers and a set time limit, or renovating a kitchen, which can be done with two or three people and a long weekend. We're talking heavy construction here. This involves maintenance of traffic (redirecting traffic flows safely), utility work, bulldozers, cranes, regrading, planting trees, pouring concrete, putting up buildings. This involves OSHA compliance and government oversight (even more so than many projects due to this being a public works project.) The municipality is going to need reassurances that volunteer labor will be adequate to completing the project safely, on time, on budget, and won't result in a bunch of untrained people getting crushed by a bulldozer.

3. Every project has an impact on the public. Even more so in a metropolitan area; there are dozens of factors that have to be taken into consideration. Will the use of volunteers detrimentally impact those factors? Are we talking about volunteers comprised of experienced construction crews, or are we talking some snot-nosed 18 year old who might have used a hammer once to nail in thumbtacks to hold up his Nickelback posters in high school? One of those two types of volunteers will know what to do when they dig into the dirt and excavate a 2"" natural gas line. The other of those two types of volunteers will vaporize in a geyser of flame from the resulting explosion, and probably cause a couple tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage, if not more. How many people know how to enact a proper maintenance of traffic plan? Do you have someone available on site with an engineering degree to handle weird stuff that you might come across when you dig into the ground and realize there is almost 150 years worth of development layered over top of each other? Got someone who knows the proper safety procedures for handling sanitary sewer or forcemain? All that affects the public around the project if it gets broken. Is one of your volunteers someone who can handle that occurrence if it happens?

This is just a brief overview of what a public agency would have to look at when it comes to volunteer labor. This is just the result of thinking about it for a few minutes; give me more time and I can come up with a much longer list of things that an agency would need to be assured of before approving volunteer labor. It wouldn't be so bad if the Watchtower Society was proposing the work be done with an experienced and approved contractor... a contractor would have lists of references, a portfolio of projects, and people the city was familiar with from other projects. I would like to add that there are reasons, and **very** good reasons, for most public works projects taking years to come to completion.

People get downright bitchy when the sidewalk they are walking on collapses into a 25' deep sinkhole caused by a leaking water main that was not installed properly. Something about injury and death seems to set them off. That is just one reason why a public agency might be slow to approve volunteer labor.",2016-01-12 20:13:32+00:00,cyvpnve,2.0,t1_cyvlnm7,5348.0,exjw

885,"Son, you know who give you blessings when you aren't serving God? Satan, that's who. That's Satan blessing you throughout your life for not doing the right thing by Jehovah and avoiding higher education. Now you aren't a Jehovah's Witness, and Satan is still blessing you for your rebellion by having the Society help contribute to your demonic wages. Just remember son, God blesses you when you're doing right, unless he's allowing you to be tested. Satan blesses you when you're doing wrong, except for those times he attacks you for no reason just because or because Jehovah took his protection away from you. Good Things=Jehovah, Bad Things=Satan. Except for those occasions when Good Things=Satan, and Bad Things=Jehovah. It gets kind of confusing at times, which is why you need the elders to tell you which is which.

I'm sure that you now realize that you need to get back to the meetings so that you can throw yourself on Jehovah's mercy and ask that Satan's blessings be taken away from you. While you're at it, you should meet with a judicial committee to go over all the evil stuff you did by abandoning Jehovah. There's nothing Jehovah likes to bless more than a person torturing themselves with grief and guilt. While you're at it, you should schedule some time with a regular pioneer to go out in service. Preaching is the only true occupation for a faithful Witness. I'm sure if you throw yourself into the ministry, Jehovah will bless you with a job to support you; perhaps Walmart is hiring stock personnel, or maybe McDonald's is looking for fry cooks?

Don't accept Satan's blessings, son. Unless it's not Satan's blessings, but is instead Jehovah's blessings. See what I mean? Confusing, needs an elder to interpret. Get thee back to a Kingdom Hall, post-haste.",2016-01-12 18:51:42+00:00,cyvlzif,1.0,t3_40n09m,9773.0,exjw

That was the attitude that I recall as well. They used to make mention of Jesus admonition against the Pharisees praying out loud in the public places, and then compare that to religious organizations and charities that beat their chests over doing public works.

Maybe I'm remembering it through rose-colored glasses though. Maybe they've been just as bad when it came to seeking publicity as everyone else for as long as they've been in existence, and I just didn't see it.

891,"&gt; Mom and I owe a big apology. After reading this article I see where we failed you and how we could have been better parents.

Boom! Right out of the gate they're hitting their stride in passive-aggressiveness and guilt tripping! I'm impressed that they didn't bother leading up to it, but rather just smacked you in the face with it right away. Plus, they get you with the leading hook to insure you read the rest of the sentence: ""Mom and I owe a big apology."" Wait, what are you saying here, Dad? Why are you apologizing? ""...I see where we failed you and how we could have been better parents."" SMACK! A double whammy! Now, due to human nature you probably want to reassure them (on some level at least) that they did not fail, and that they were actually good parents... but this also serves as a bitter message that you are inadequate in some respect, or else they wouldn't need to apologize for being parental failures. Great job on the manipulation, Dad! That was pro-level work right there. So many guilt-laden layers... followed immediately by a Watchtower article written and designed to help twist that emotional knife even deeper.

Your response was great. I'd only change one part, but that's because of my own biases:

&gt; I'm putting the ~~large~~ intellect you and mom passed down to me to use, and currently have a 3.7+ GPA in college.

I'd personally strike ""large"" from the sentence as it smacks of braggadocio to me. Everything else is fine; I don't agree that the rest of it is borderline boasting, as you are simply stating why you are happy with who you are as a person, and are also letting your father know you appreciate that their parenting helped mold you into the success you have become. Just that one word in the sentence above seems like bragging to me... but again, that's my own biases and personal preference.

You might also want to change ""superstition"" at the end there, but I don't think I would remove it. The email they sent was designed to elicit an emotional response and to be hurtful as well as manipulate you emotionally. I think a little smack on the hand for that kind of behavior is warranted.

Most exJW's tend to be a bit shell shocked when they first begin to truly wake up and realize that this isn't just some run-of-the-mill religion, but a full-blown cult. There are many of us who think all religion is culty, but there are notable differences between a religion and a cult. For one, you can stop worshipping in a religion without any real consequence... and there are a number of other differences as well. Cults are religion run amok, if you want to really simplify it.

Here is a link to [the BITE model,](https://freedomofmind.com//Info/BITE/bitemodel.php) which is used by many to identify cults (high control groups.) It's based off of previous work by psychologists Robert Lifton and Margaret Singer. Note: a cult doesn't have to match ALL the identifying marks, but if an organization matches most of them you might have a cult on your hands. [The Watchtower Society](https://www.freedomofmind.com/Info/infoDet.php?id=114&amp;title=Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_-_aka_Watchtower_Bible_and_Tract_Society) is listed in the group database of the website Freedom of Mind (which is the website started by Steve Hassan, who came up with the BITE model). While Mr. Hassan doesn't come right out and say they are a destructive cult, his database does list the various parts of the BITE model for destructive groups that they match (just hover your mouse over the icons with the yellow arrows in the boxes titled ""Behavior Control, Information Control, Thought Control, Emotional Control).

931,"They are fraying already, they are just refusing to acknowledge it. The amount of cognitive dissonance I see in them is painful... to both them and me. However, they are also wracked by fear and guilt. It's a damned shame, because they are both intelligent people otherwise. If they were crazy, like some folks parents are, or if they were bad people, like some of the parents I read about on this sub, then it would be different. But they aren't... they are good people who are trapped in an organization sucking the life out of them like a spider; they just prefer staying in the web because it's secure and keeps them from having to make their own way in the world mentally.

I think a lot of what makes them hold on, even when I believe they have deep seated doubts, is the same fear we all had at one time that everything they have done or sacrificed is a waste. Then there is the fear that they are simply allowing doubt and weakness to affect their spirituality and thus they (and by extension everyone they love) will break Sky Daddy's heart and cause Him to kill them all. The problem is that saying things that imply that is the case is met with immediate defensiveness and hostility, which means that a meaningful conversation in which I might be able to reason with them will end in a fight. I'd rather not widen the rift more than necessary at this time. I can't afford to just now.

Even when I can afford to widen the rift, I have no desire to. I do care for them, but more than that I care for my wife and kids, and I don't want their relationship to suffer more than it has just because I'm now evil.

&gt; 
&gt; 23  “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you give the tenth of the mint and the dill and the cumin, but you have disregarded the weightier matters of the Law, namely, justice and mercy and faithfulness. These things it was necessary to do, yet not to disregard the other things. 24  Blind guides, who strain out the gnat but gulp down the camel!

&gt; 
&gt; 27  “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you resemble whitewashed graves, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful but inside are full of dead men’s bones and of every sort of uncleanness. 28  In the same way, on the outside you appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.",2016-01-08 15:57:04+00:00,cyqow0d,1.0,t3_4004di,29982.0,exjw

Yes, Josephus (and Origen) are frequently used to bolster WTBTS claims of the actual historicity of Jesus. Both of them have writings attributed to them that speak of Jesus. Just to cover bases, the WT generally uses the arguments of other apologists to convey the idea that these sources did not have forged writings tacked on to what they actually wrote.

Older WT's and Awakes often had some rather well written apologetic articles on the history of Christianity, especially in the 90's. I can't speak for the stuff written prior to that, since that was the time period I became interested in and converted to Dubness. I realize now that a lot of the apologetics are wrong, and much of them are outright falsifications of actual history, and of course the WTBTS and people like them are going to cherry pick their supporting data.

All this is just to make it seem like the writing department has real scholars looking into actual academic work on the Bible. In reality, they crib their notes from others.",2016-01-08 15:25:18+00:00,cyqnn1n,1.0,t3_401asa,3189.0,exjw

I've had really good, really bad, and traumatic.

My first honeymoon: wife got sick and went to the hospital.

My ex-wife had really screwed up views on sex.) Infection set in, trip to ER, lots of fun had, honeymoon ruined. It should have been foreshadowing of the rest of that marriage, only with more mental illness and psychotic behavior. LOTS of mental illness and psychotic behavior. This was a period of deep trauma for me, and took me years to get over a lot of the shit she did to me (still have hangups and triggers from it; my ex was a very abusive person.)

My second honeymoon: much better than the first since I was with a sexually compatible person and we were both reasonably liberated in our views on sex (no nookie before marriage, but willing to do almost anything together, and we both thought sex was terrifically awesome - and still think that), and because my wife and I hadn't had sex in quite a long time (around 2 years for me, 7 years for her) we had lots and lots of fun.

That being said, if the mic was immediately handed off to a sister and she said something to the effect of ""that dumbass brother over there got the answer wrong, here's the REAL answer,"" then they most likely wouldn't find themselves called on for a long time. That wouldn't happen though if the sister just gave the right answer without calling out the other person though (I saw a number of occasions where something similar to this happened with no ill effect for the sister.) The brothers I knew would probably have handled it the same way for a man if a brother had done the ""that dumbass sister..."" callout as well.

There is only one thing that results in scriptural grounds for divorce with the right for remarriage in the congregation. On the other hand, he now gets to explain to a very pissed off and hurt wife exactly what happened (if she wants to know the details.)

I don't agree with the policy as it stands, since if you're going to make it policy that ""it is best to have her believing husband present for the hearing"" I feel it's hypocritical not to have it both ways, but at least they do have to inform her that he was unfaithful to her.

Being a servant really hammered home a lot of the doubts I had.

I mean, for the example I guess you could claim ""Cries of Peace and Security!"", but deep down you just know it's not true.

Plus, the servant body meetings with the CO... some of the stuff you learn from the CO on official doctrine for specific cases is eye opening.

991,"/u/practeerts, Your advice above was good. You are correct, most US courts are now awarding shared custody with 50% timesharing rights (different states have various terms for custody and visitation, but it's all basically the same thing.) Most parents will now get 50%; there are exceptions, but it's becoming more rare, and generally there are extenuating circumstances for it.

/u/FadingorDrifting, if your situation ends in divorce (and the advice I'm giving below is specifically for that case), please understand that your rights as a father in most states is far better than it would have been just 10 years ago. **First, here's the obligatory: Get an attorney immediately upon separation!!!** If you don't do that, you will fuck yourself. She/he doesn't need to be the most expensive attorney in the city, but you don't want bargain-basement either. Generally mid-level will do just fine. In my city that means roughly $1500-$2000 retainer, $250 per hour once the retainer is used up. Understand that a lot of the work will be done by a paralegal, so your retainer will stretch for a decent while.

Some of the horror stories you'll come across in researching things on the internet are older stories rehashed, or are exaggerated, or are outright lies, or are parents (on both sides) who lost custody for some damned good reasons and are not admitting why, or are just assholes who get off on scaring emotionally vulnerable people (and you will be, if you aren't already, emotionally vulnerable.) Unless you are an addict, have been arrested for abusing your spouse or child, or are somehow deemed a danger to your children, you will likely get *at least* 40% visitation, and will probably get 50%. 

**Religious views or affiliation carries virtually no weight in a court of law.** You could be a Satanist... and it shouldn't matter (I'd probably still avoid to admitting Satanism if you were a member of that belief... better safe than sorry.) The court doesn't give a damn whether or not you are a JW, a Jew, a Catholic, Hindi, Buddhist, an atheist, or a Pastafarian. You have a 1st Amendment (US Constitution) right that to freedom of religion and expression of belief, and that the government cannot interfere with that (and the courts are a branch of government, so are held to that standard as well.) Of course, this also means you cannot ask the courts to interfere with your wife's rights either... so don't do that. You can teach the kids what you believe in your home, she can teach them what she believes in her home. Unless you both agree that the kids should be raised as JW's in both homes, the court won't get involved in that. Ha, my JW ex-wife is currently trying this shit with me right this moment, and it's failing...

**In most states your wife cannot leave the area you guys live in and take the kids with her.** You should be protected from that; it can cost her custody of the children (she poses a danger in that she is refusing them a relationship with their father for inadequate reasons.) Admittedly, enforcement of those laws is sometimes an issue, but normally the court gets really pissy about it if a parent violates the law. The institution responsible for upholding the law tends to feel it personally when someone treats that law with contempt.

If I were you, along with retaining an attorney **immediately** if your wife chose separation, I'd also start researching the term ""high conflict parent."" Check out the website [*Our Family Wizard*](https://www.ourfamilywizard.com/solutions/high-conflict-parenting); it's got oodles of helpful stuff. I wish they had information about it when I was going through my divorce 14 years ago. This is assuming that divorce is on the horizon; if it isn't then you might want to hold off on the attorney as that seems to add a little strain to a relationship for some reason (unreasonable spouses!) I'd still check out high conflict parents though; you're going to have some issues there to work out.

Additionally, you might be well served by this book: [*Custody Chaos, Personal Peace: Sharing Custody with an Ex Who Drives You Crazy*](http://www.amazon.com/Custody-Chaos-Personal-Peace-ebook/dp/B002X848P0/) It might be useful even if you guys remain together; again, you're going to face differing opinions on how to raise the kids on various subjects.

I'm in no way an attorney, but I'm quite familiar with what you might be facing. I'm a divorced (and remarried) father who has majority timesharing (60%) of my daughter. I've done a ton of research into this stuff due to frequent and almost constant legal disputes with my JW ex-wife (your mileage may and likely will vary - my ex-wife seems to have a mental disorder. If your wife is anything approaching reasonable, then you shouldn't have as many legal entanglements as I've had.) I'm currently undergoing my fifth session of legal harassment, so I feel for you dude.

You're in a bad place right now, man; try to take heart though. As long as the two of you want and try to make things work, you're not too badly off... there's damage there, but it needn't be insurmountable. If the marriage does fail, then you have options. Get your shit together, keep your nose clean legally, and be as good a father as you can be. Everything else will sort out, and if your spouse tries to do a runner with the kids, you get an attorney on that stat.",2016-01-05 03:49:23+00:00,cymdus2,6.0,t1_cymb6eu,4164.0,exjw

Tomorrow is Star Wars, and I hear it's supposed to be a good return to the feeling of the original trilogy.

1019,"Yeah, what I wrote above is almost exactly the reason the Society fears education. An educated person, one who is being taught how to sift facts, one who is taught critical thinking skills, and one who is exposed to a variety of other ideas and thoughts and not kept within the very tight confines that the Society wants/needs its followers to be kept, is a person who will likely wake up to reality and leave the organization behind. Hell, they even say this themselves from the platforms at the Kingdom Hall, from the stage at assemblies and conventions, and from their little television set on JW tv. Of course, they use loaded language and symbolism to make it something to be feared by their followers.

I've always found their stance on education to be distasteful. Even when I was a true-blue believer (and I was for a long period of time) I did not like or care for their views and statements towards education. Cognitive dissonance really hammered me on that aspect. I used to go to great lengths to justify what I heard with what I felt internally: ""Oh, that was just the speaker's thoughts. Oh, that is what was written, but it wasn't what was meant. Oh, they're only talking about sacrificing yourself to education, they don't mean to actually not seek to learn and develop.""

However, what they say is exactly what they mean: higher education is not something a JW should seek. What they hide is their actual reasoning: higher education makes it far more likely you will see the organization for what it is - a high control religion (at best) or a cult, and that their teachings are based upon shifting sands of tortured and mutilated logic.",2015-12-17 21:25:25+00:00,cy2o4nu,4.0,t1_cy2lxo8,3259.0,exjw
1020,"My experience was similar to yours: converted in my late teens. Although I went to a tech school in my early 20's, it really didn't give me the broad based education I would later get when I went to my local community college in my late 30's. I really wish I had gone to university much, much earlier.

The classes you often take seem like bullshit when you first read what the requirements of your degree are; but when you get into class, you often find yourself engaging and enjoying the subject. I thought humanities was going to be BS; turned out my art history course was extremely interesting (it explored humanity's development from primitives to post-Renaissance through the art that was produced... it touched upon religion, culture, history, and the evolution of human society. It was utterly fascinating.) The same thing held true for Ethics; I found myself becoming interested in philosophy and how it applies to us... and this was while I was a ministerial servant (that course helped, among other things, nail shut the cover of the coffin on my beliefs in the Society.) Heh, I wrote and defended an oral argument regarding euthanasia of humans... I took the pro-euthanasia side... as a ministerial servant. That course really helped me to realize some things about myself and the world around me.

I cannot stress and promote the idea of furthering your education enough if you want to become a more informed person better able to understand the world around you. The interchange of thoughts on college campuses and the exposure you get to different ideas really helps you explore yourself as a human being, provided you are willing to be objective and to be willing to adopt new ideals.

1044,"Isolation will often drive a person to go back to an abusive situation, even if they know it's abusive. There have been numerous psych studies done on this, but the gist is that we humans don't operate in isolation very well. Even if it hurts us, we will return to social contact because we need it.

I'm reminded of a series of psychology experiments done by Harry Harlow on monkeys. Partial isolation of monkeys resulted in various abnormalities (bland staring, repetitive movements, self mutilation.) Total isolation resulted in severe psychological disturbances (emotional shock, autistic self-clutching and rocking, refusal to eat and eventual self-starvation, and eventually almost complete social obliteration of the animals.) As an aside, Harlow was a genuine mother-fucking bastard, but as a result of his experiments we have a much better understanding of the results of social isolation on ourselves.

Through disfellowshipping and disassociation, through marking and shunning, the Watchtower Society tries to socially isolate its followers if they break the rules or if they try to leave. They know, through experience, that most people will break and come back to them (and will sometimes be even more determined not to leave again) if they don't have any outside contacts or friendships. Abusive relatives/spouses do something similar to their families and victims. That's a part of the reason that abusers... erm, the Watchtower Society... tries to socially isolate their followers from the rest of the world.

I find it laughable that some people are screaming about Cedars enriching himself on this book. A standard paperback (not a hard cover!) costs about US$8.99. Cedars' friend is offering a printed copy and bound version of CoC for $10. This is a book that has a **very limited** audience... meaning he can't make much profit off of volume, like a lot of publishers do. A lot of people out there who are a part of that limited audience don't necessarily want a printed copy; after all, we're using electronic media for almost everything today which drives down potential customers even further. Cedars and his friend are offering an alternative for people who absolutely want the feel of paper in their hands. If this was a ""get rich quick"" scheme or an actual business plan, it's a very poorly thought-out one, and I would have expected someone like Cedars, who runs a successful blog, to be smarter than that (and he is, it appears.)

1063,"&gt; Animism goes MUCH farther back than the ""15th &amp; 16th centuries"" (good grief, are you referring to BC or CE?) Just look at the Australian Aborigines' native religions - their culture &amp; origins date back at least 20,000 years &amp; have been indicated as being as old as 60,000 years - if not older.

I think you misunderstood what I was saying, or perhaps I wasn't clear about it. I was referring to the fact that animism was around **until** at least the 15th &amp; 16th centuries. If I had intended that as 15th century BCE I would have stated it as such... but I wasn't saying that the dawn of Tengriism was in the 15th century, but rather it's eventual death (though that's still not quite correct; it survived in pockets of the world - as you state, aboriginal Australians, for example - and it's still around in various forms.) It was a surviving religious culture until it was finally overwhelmed by the modern religious cultures. I did not say that it was only as old as the 15th or 16th centuries, and in fact stated that it was one of the oldest forms of religious systems known to history... which would put it as old as the oldest religious artifacts ever found. It's at the very least around 28,000 years old, and very likely older than that. We can infer a lot about early hominids, but without definitive evidence and artifacts what we know about their religious views and practices is an educated guess (but educated guesses are often quite accurate as we've seen in the past.)

Female fertility goddesses date back to at least 28,000 - 25,000 BCE (Venus of Wittendorf) and probably much later. The Berekhat Ram figurine is contested; there are questions attached to whether or not it was created as a figurine by hominids at all, whether or not it was intended to represent something significant, and whether or not it's actually a female figure. Personally, I think you are correct and that it is a female deity figurine; it seems too coincidentally shaped for anything other than intentional shaping, and the fracture lines are in keeping with the simple stone tools that we know earlier hominids used.

As for the religious apologists... well, you're going to have them pop up in those threads. That's pretty much a given. However, generally the more objective historians tend to point out the fallacies in those threads. Still, there is much in history that is open to interpretation; there is a lot of it which is comprised of educated (very educated) guesses... it's often quite accurate, but sometimes it's not. That's why a good historian is willing to adjust his thoughts on a matter given evidence to the contrary.",2015-12-11 13:49:30+00:00,cxvas06,11.0,t1_cxurdm2,48115.0,exjw
1064,"&gt; I go by what the archaeologists have to say, not the rabbis. The rabbis would have a vested interest in making their religion seem as old as possible.

That's why I linked the topic from /r/AskHistorians. Like /r/askscience it requires a certain threshold of quality and expertise. As one poster in the thread pointed out, rabbis are experts in theology, not history. Their interpretation of what constitutes Judaism and its beginnings don't necessarily match an historian's. That said, the historian may actually define the beginning of Judaism earlier than the rabbi might, if he includes the polytheistic beginnings that monotheistic Yahwism descended from. That is, however, a matter for interpretation by the historian; I would hope that he would base it off of anthropology and archaeology (and I believe most would.) It would seem from some of the comments in that thread that most rabbis seem to agree with historians, archaeologists, and anthropologists. As one commentator in the thread puts it:

&gt; Judaism is defined as being the monotheistic religion that worships the god of Abraham, and there is very little variation here, regardless of how strict the other various laws and rituals are followed. So most rabbis would say modern Judaism started 2500 years ago, and most would argue the ancient Israelites started worshiping YHWH no sooner than 1200BC. Some orthodox rabbis who take the bible literally would say Judaism is a few hundred years older than that, going back to when Abraham made the covenant with god.

He then goes on to mention how Hindu scholars put the date of their religion earlier, and that there is some evidence that can be argued for that idea.

However, there were forms of animism and shamanism (the earliest forms of religion that we know of) that extended all the way into the 15th and 16th centuries at the very least [\(**Tengriism.**\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengrism) That is perhaps the very oldest of religious systems.

Some people view that as a threat to themselves, or are jealous of his successes where they don't have as much, and then some people just want to hate other folks and don't really need a reason to.

There are factions in the exJW movement. I hesitate to call it a community, because that implies we're somehow a united group. We aren't. There are lots of different clusters of people who group together (you could call these different groups ""communities"") but not all of these groups necessarily identify or agree with one another. We're not a united nation. We're a loose confederation (at best) of differing thoughts, ideals, actions, and beliefs.

Plus, there is a high incident of mental illness among Witnesses (more so than the Society will admit or ever recognize.) I don't know if it's higher than the general population, but it seems that fundamentalist religions (and cults) tend to breed that kind of thing. Partly this is due to the person themselves, and partly it's due to environmental factors (the crushing guilt, the constant cognitive dissonance, being told all the time that you are essentially unworthy, undeserving of God's kindness - in otherwords, undeserving of love - etc.) Some people come out of the organization carrying a ton of baggage and can't seem to let it go or get over it, and don't want or can't pay for the help necessary to release that burden.

You probably wouldn't want to beat her over the head with things (that's generally counter productive and sends most JW's scurrying for the comforting protection of lies the WTBTS gives them.) If you decide to attempt to tell her TTATT, then you would probably have the best results from Socratic methods of discussion, i.e. a form of inquiry and discussion between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to illuminate ideas.

Since you are out of the organization and she knows you are out, and she's willing to continue a relationship with you regardless, you have an advantage that many of folks here feel they don't have. You don't have to hide yourself from her. You can discuss things much more openly than someone attempting a fade. Is there a real downside to either of you if you were to begin discussing TTATT? Would she close you off and begin a process of shunning, and if she did, how long would it last since that hasn't been her method of operation up to this point?

Unless she is the kind of person who would begin shunning you for simply discussing (again, Socratic method of questions/answers) things about her beliefs, then you have a lot to gain from discussing TTATT and little to lose.

The only area of concern I would have, in your place, is her lack of a social network outside of the organization. That can be overcome though, should she wake up.

We have helped JW's wake up; we've had some come in here with sincere questions and doubts who have been shown TTATT.

Where a lot of us shine is when JW's start preaching in other forums or doing AMA's. Oh, I love mixing it up in those things. I've gotten a lot of ApostaService time in those things... I hope that the JW's involved wake up, and I try to reason things with them in such a way (well, up until they start getting nasty to all of us dirty apostates) that hopefully they start really questioning things. Many of us in here get involved in those things, and it's a sight to behold.

But where we really shine, in my opinion, are for JW's who haven't really woken up yet, but are beginning to question and research their beliefs. When they stumble in here (and it happens), this place can do a great job of helping them to wake up. That's more or less how I woke up; I had begun questioning and researching, and I came across this place while trying to find out other people's experiences with the organization.

1135,"No real differences, really... they aren't mutually exclusive or supportive. In that, I mean that they are related, but they're really measuring slightly different things. I'll throw this in here from the /r/atheism subreddit's FAQ:

&gt; What's the difference between agnosticism and atheism?
&gt; 
&gt; Atheism and agnosticism are not mutually exclusive. ""Agnosticism"" is not some third position which is neither ""atheism"" nor ""theism"". They are different answers to different questions, in this case ""Do you believe that any gods exist?"" and ""Do you believe it is possible to know whether any gods exist?"".
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone who does not hold a belief in one or more gods is an atheist. Someone who holds an active belief in the nonexistence of particular gods is specifically known as a ""strong"" or ""explicit"" atheist, as opposed to ""weak"" or ""implicit"" atheists who make no claims either way.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, the vast majority of atheists are at least technically agnostic, even if they are willing to treat fairy tales about Zeus or Allah with the same contempt that they treat tales about unicorns and leprechauns. Describing yourself as ""Just an agnostic"", or stating ""I'm not an atheist, I'm an agnostic"" makes about as much as saying ""I'm not Spanish, I'm male.""
&gt; 
&gt; See also [this handy infographic](https://i.imgur.com/xXuNC.jpg) or the page it's from for a more detailed discussion of this principle.

So, an agnostic atheist would say something to the effect of: ""I see no evidence to support the concept of deities, but I don't believe it's possible to know for certain whether they exist or not.""

A gnostic atheist would say something to the effect of ""I see no evidence to support the concept of deities, and I believe it's possible to prove that they don't exist.""

An anti-theist would say something to the effect of ""I see no evidence to support the concept of deities, and the idea of deities and/or religion are kind of (or very) repulsive to me.""

The above examples are simplified, and it's not like there's a unified hierarchy of atheists in the first place or an organized system of disbelief... if there were, it would be a religion, and it most certainly ISN'T that.

I agree that the Israelite's were brutish, even for their times. There are numerous examples of more progressive societies around them (as you bring up, the Hammurabic laws were more progressive than the Mosaic law, which seems to have been based on Hammurabi's codes.) The point I was making was that societies of the times were far more harsh and barbaric than what we, in Western societies at least, would be familiar with, including the Babylonian society of Hammurabi's time (for example: *If a son strike his father, they shall cut off his fingers.*) What we often take for granted (basic human rights) would have been thoroughly unfamiliar to our ancestors... basic human rights have evolved throughout history. Rome, as an example, was far more progressive legally than the Mosaic law. Women had far more rights under that regime. Well, wealthy women were, at any rate... you were royally fucked (often literally) if you were a slave of either gender... but even then, their social customs and laws were far more barbaric than what we, their social descendants, would be comfortable with. Then again, the laws of various European nations back during the Renaissance would be rather brutal in many ways compared to our own.

Societies today which enact Sharia law would be far more familiar to an ancient time traveler from Babylon (or Israel) than our own Western governments.

But yeah, the Israelites were a piece of work. Aren't we glad that our laws in Western societies aren't, contrary to what religious fundamentalists like to claim, actually descended from the Bible?",2015-12-02 20:42:02+00:00,cxkt0vt,7.0,t1_cxkrvup,1505.0,exjw

1155,"Nah, it sucks for those of us waiting, or even helping, social evolution along its path.

One might say that a lot of the violent backlash in today's society (such as fundamentalist Christians lashing out so hard against various things changing, such as sexual equality and acceptance of gender identity issues) is a result of social evolution occurring rapidly in our time. Things are viewed far differently (and better, IMHO) than they were when I was a teenager, a mere 20+/- years ago.

When I was about 12-13 (around 1987-1988,) the area I lived in was a rather backwards, redneck, and rural area about 20 years behind the rest of the country in terms of progress. You couldn't come out as gay in high school. Not if you wanted to make it to adult years... Hell, it can be rough now in many areas, but back then, in my community, you would have been driven into suicide by the 'necks or would have faced a life of ridicule and possibly beatings. Gay bashing may have been illegal back then (it's assault, no matter what), but it was still something to be very afraid of if you were homosexual. My mother, who is bisexual, and my second mom, who is lesbian, were not able to be open about their relationship, *even with their own kids.* We might have let things slip, you see... and then been subject to ridicule and abuse ourselves. Plus, both my parents worked for the government... my mother was a corrections officer in a county jail at the time, and my second-mom was working with the federal government. The federal government would have fired her immediately if proof of homosexuality were given them (she was in the Army Corps of Engineers, which - though civilian - falls under the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army. This was prior to the ""don't ask/don't tell"" policy, but even then would still have resulted in job loss.)

That was the environment I grew up in.

Around 15-ish, social progress had gotten to the point where some people would defend a homosexual's rights in my high school. You'd still be an object of ridicule and social ostracization, but things were getting better. It doesn't seem like much, until you realize that it would have been unthinkable just 3-4 years previously.

Now, gays and lesbians can get married. And they don't have to marry each other!!! Men can marry men, women can marry women, and somehow the Apocalypse hasn't happened, society hasn't yet crumbled, and people like Josh Fuerstein are being viewed by the majority of Americans as bigoted fucktards trying to hold society back, instead of being the norm! It only took a quarter century, but hot damn! We're getting better!

I can remember it being a highly shocking situation when I was 15-ish that a black person and a white person might make an interracial couple (too bad... I was flirting hard with a couple of black girls back then that I was very interested in getting to know better... but it was as heavily frowned upon in our black community as it was in the white community.) Sounds weird now, doesn't it? My kids have (thankfully) never grown up in a household or society in which that has been a real issue (outside of the most disgusting of bigots.) My oldest son, who is now 20, used to attend a middle school where everyone at his lunch table except him identified as homo- or bisexual. My daughter, who is now 15, identifies currently as bisexual (I say currently because she has very little life experience, and might realize later on that she is not bi. She may be hetero, she may be homo, or she may continue as bi, and I will welcome whatever she is when she has it all locked down for herself.)

Now the big bugaboo is marriage equality and whether or not transexuals can be recognized as human beings, and whether or not they are allowed to take a piss or shit with the gender they identify with. Given how things have gone, and what I've seen through my own lifetime, it's going to be rocky for these folks for a while since social evolution results in upheavals, but it's going to happen.

We're always going to have the hateful, the bigoted, and the mean-spirited with us, and they will always fight change and progress, because it means that they either have to change as well, or they have to finally admit that their hatreds, their bigotry, and their prejudices are wrong... and given the types of people most of these folks seem to be, they hate admitting they are wrong about their filthy thoughts, and use their god to justify it.

But those assholes are dying out. Slowly, painfully (for the rest of us at least), loudly... but they are disappearing. We're getting better.

1157,"&gt; the bible contains at least (at the VERY least) three gods

There is a decent book out there called *A History of God* by Karen Armstrong which delves into this. It's a weighty book (and I haven't finished it yet,) but there is a ton of evidence of the rise of El, the transferrence to Yahweh, and the eventual evolution into the Jesus/Yahweh trinity thing.

As for the Israelites and their brutal manifestation of God(s)... well, their pantheon was rather brutal from which Yahweh descended. And Yahweh was, after all, a god of war (*Jehovah of Armies...*). The religious leaders were rather brutal, but then again many human societies of the time were rather brutal compared to what we live under.

1158,"&gt; I just think it would be interesting to know how many people would choose to ignore the truth if it were somehow possible to make them know what is actually in the Bible.

A lot of them would ignore it. Think about it: evolution is, beyond a reasonable doubt, factual. We have several different scientific disciplines that back it up. We have the most learned men in the history of the world who accept it as fact. Our children in elementary school are being taught and understand things about our universe that were a complete mystery to the writers of any of the world's religious books. Yet, even in a secular, technologically advanced nation such as the United States, we still see [**this crap**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Science_Education_Act) happening, and even gaining traction in many other states.

People want the comfort of myth and the ability to repudiate their own personal responsibilities to one another and the world around them. It's far easier to coast through life thinking that Magical Sky Daddy is going to fix everything rather than to make hard choices about fixing the problems ourselves. It's easier to look at homeless refugees and say ""God wills this"" rather than to sacrifice something out of our own lives to help support them. Why bother mitigating our effects on the environment (I say mitigate, because we aren't going to stop what we are doing) when we can say ""God-Allah-Brahma-etc. won't let the world die.""

Of course, on that last point... the world **won't** die, not to us anyway. It will continue on. However, most of the life on it that we are familiar with, and we ourselves, might go extinct due to our actions... but the Earth abides (much like The Dude.)

People don't like facts. They don't like truth. That sort of thing is uncomfortable, and the problem is that most people **want** things to be comfortable, even if it means ignoring that which is staring them in the face, and even if it means that their children will suffer the consequences.

*That being said...*

I do believe that humanity has it within ourselves to improve our conditions, and to improve the world around us. I am, at heart, a humanist. I believe that through human agency, we can build a better society. I also believe that we are seeing a gradual and upward trend towards those goals; through the activism of people like Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Bill and Melinda Gates, the Clintons (their foundation is doing some really good things) and others like them, plus all of us ""common"" folk who support these things.

Assuming we can survive the next century or so, I think we will be far better off, and far more willing to acknowledge fact and truth. I believe the best chance of this is through secularism. Religion divides humanity and stifles progress, whereas science explores uncharted territory and furthers our knowledge and abilities.

So, to sum up: most people right now want myths and fables. But, we're slowly getting better. Like a patient recovering from a debilitating and long-lasting disease, we are building up our strength and healing. It's going to take time, though, and the real question for me is do we have enough time left before we fuck ourselves past the point of no return?

If I didn't believe that little myth of human progress, then there wouldn't be much point to the future to me.",2015-12-02 16:48:22+00:00,cxkit3f,5.0,t1_cxkhayh,2216.0,exjw
1159,"&gt; why so many people now choose to worship such a despicable being

Because although we're certainly more sophisticated about a lot of things and how we do them, we aren't really all that far removed from the people who created these religions in the first place. We are still, by and large, trying to placate these fickle, psychopathic deities because we are afraid of dying and what comes after death. We don't seem to cope well with the idea that after we die, the party continues on without us. We still want to be a part of it, and we want the party to get better for us when we finally kick off.

Mankind is fearful and superstitious, even today. **That** is why people still choose to serve what is otherwise a despicable being.

Additionally, mankind has warped the concept of deities into something that they didn't start out as. Part of this is willful ignorance, part of it is through design because they are uncomfortable with what is, in the Bible, a rather bloodthirsty deity. Other religions aren't immune to this either; the god or gods may change, but ultimately they are manifestations and exaggerations of human beings. We weren't created in God's image... he/they were created in ours, and that includes the baser and worst aspects of humanity. However, most people think of the God of the bible, for example, as some sort of cuddly Santa Claus like figure. I heard a radio talk show host just yesterday making a claim that what you see with violent and extremist religious nuts (he was specifically speaking of the Colorado Springs abortion clinic murderer) isn't in or condoned by the Bible... except that the radio host is dead wrong. The Bible screams for the blood of infidels and ""sinners"" just as much as the Quran does. Death of people who don't believe as you do is a central part of the entire damned book. People want to ignore that and act like God is some sort of loving grandpa, but these people have either not read their own holy book, or have completely derailed what the central pillars of support for Christianity really are.

Edit: Religion evolves over time. It's how the Canaanite god El was replaced/morphed into Yahweh, God of Armies. It's how Yahweh morphed (at least partly) into Jesus. It's also how Yahweh morphed into Allah. Yet, underneath it all the vicious, psychopathic, mentally ill deity or spirit who was willing to kill your crops, kill your herds, and destroy everything and everyone you hold dear because you didn't sacrifice the *right kind of animal* to him, is the same deity that now threatens global destruction, an eternity of hellfire (or utter and complete nothingness per JW's, after killing you horrifically and in great terror at that global desctruction) and who will withdraw his blessings upon you so that life goes to shit if you don't worship him in the exact way he dictates (which changes from denomination to denomination.)

**TL/DR:** People are afraid of death, leading to superstition and placating of a psychopathic deity who is responsible for killing them. Plus, people willingly ignore the more hostile aspects of their gods in much the same way as an abuse victim stays with their abuser.",2015-12-02 15:16:34+00:00,cxkf7vu,3.0,t1_cxkeg5i,1350.0,exjw
1160,"If you plant 6 food (that's 6 mutfruits, or 12 corn, or 12 tatos, for example) and select a settler, then select **one** of the plants, they will automatically start collecting food from the remaining plants (up to their total of 6 food.)

So, plant 12 tatos (0.5 food each) in a row. Grab a settler and then have them ""Go"" to the end plant on the row. Watch your food counter rise from ""0"" to ""6."" You don't need to individually assign him to each single plant, he'll do it on his own with open plants up to his maximum of 6 food.

1182,"I was trying to be humorous about the scenario. As the saying goes, there's probably a kernel of truth to the story. You're right, slingers were very accurate; slinging was a preferred method for people to take down birds until the Middle Ages at least, and they made for effective skirmishers. There are reasons they were used for so long throughout humanity's history of warfare; eventually it became more cost effective to field archers rather than slingers (and archery technology had managed to far outstrip slinging in effectiveness and range, but this took time.)

On the other hand, you have a giant who wore full armor. Unless he left his helm off, he didn't have a lot of flesh to strike with a stone; it's possible he didn't use a full face helm, so there's that, but the head is also a hard target to hit. As you move it moves, and since it's an extremity it tends to move a lot in comparison to the central body mass. This is part of the reason why modern shooters are often taught to aim at center mass and not the head; head shots are generally quite debilitating (even if it isn't a lethal shot; a shattered jaw is quite distracting) but it's a smaller and harder target to hit.

The story could be true, but I'd say the 6'-9"" height would be far more likely than 9' and change. Far, far more likely, especially as exceptionally tall people normally have a host of health problems associated with whatever caused them to have such height and don't typically live that long. As you say, though, 6'-9"" would have (and still is) freakishly big, more so when your average person was only a bit over 5'.

However, I also think we are far, *FAR* better off with it being on more equitable terms. I've become much more aware of what she faced as a JW wife and feeling like she had to be submissive (and feeling guilt and anger when she didn't want to be), and she's become much more aware of how much being ""head of household"" really sucked for me when I felt like I was in a position where I had to make the decision on something because it was something expected of me just because I happen to have a penis.

I will say that the transition from JW to non-JW family probably went more smoothly for us than it might for some of our former friends though. If nothing else, we didn't really fit in with the JW version of a typical family, nor did we really exercise our roles in that family in the way the Watchtower kept trying to hammer us. Our dynamics were much more akin to what you expect to see in a modern family (with give-and-take, communication, and working decisions through with compromise) than the pseudo-1950's *Leave-It-To-Beaver, Father-Knows-Best* fantasies that the Watchtower Society promoted as the best form of family.

Plus, her protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, my wife really sucks at submissiveness. It's one of the many things about her that attracted me in the first place. I don't like weak women.

*Edit:* Oh, lord... I would not have made decisions like the ones you listed here without her input and without shared decision making:

&gt; when another imperfect human can ultimately decide where you live, where you go, how the money gets spent, how the kids are raised, etc.

Not without her input. Hell, for that matter, I'd have left most of that to her. I don't handle the bank accounts, I just deposit my paycheck in there... I'd never categorically decide ""We're moving **here,**"" without her buy-in. As for how the kids are raised, that argument never really came up for us because we have been on the same page about it for most of their lives... these are all decisions that **have** to be made together.

It's been a pretty good game so far; there are some glitches and bugs (Bethesda's corporate motto: *Come for the bitches, stay for the glitches.*) In fairness, it's far less buggy than previous Bethesda titles have been... they did a really good job on it.

There's a number of things that they changed from previous versions of the game that are a bit jarring. No skill checks during conversations, for one... that one actually sucks. And there are a number of things missing that they could have included in the game that just seem to be common sense... better ways of tracking your settlement population and where they are assigned, for example. But the overall game has been quite positive in my opinion. Combat is a lot harder in it, I think. Mole rats are actually dangerous in this game... and then there are the ghouls.

Even frontiersmen throughout history tended to band together in groups, even though those groups may have been small.

That's fine... that's what this subreddit is for; it's supposed to offer support for people extricating themselves from an absolutely shitty situation. However, we also need to remember to laugh, and hence my silly post.

The Society wants to paint everything outside of their sphere of influence as awful, evil, and empty. I'm very lucky, and I know it. I've got an awesome wife who got me a game I've been looking forward to playing for around five years, which is a sequel to a game that I spent possibly around a thousand hours playing. I will likely spend as much time in this game as that one. Plus, it's almost my birthday. Granted, that means I'm one year older, and the sands of time are slowly running out for me, but on the other hand... birthday present, birthday dinner, and a family that seems (contrary to all logic) to actually love me.

The job is... well, it's a job. It's better than many, worse than some, is extremely demanding and pressure-filled, and I look forward to when my wife finally graduates college so she can be my sugar momma while I go back to school to do something that interests me. Nothing against the job itself, nor the company (which has, in all fairness, been a reasonably good employer.) However, having spent two years largely unemployed during the Recession, and three years in extremely unstable jobs just trying to make ends somehow meet, it's been a blessing (even when I'm ready to rampage against my estimators.) It's been really, really hard on us financially, but we're at a point now where we can play a little bit once again. Blessings from Jehovah, and all that... right?

Still, if I'm being totally honest... I'd totally call in sick on Friday to Fallout my brains out for the entire weekend if I had the opportunity. That doesn't mean the world sucks, it just means that I have to be a grown up. I don't **want** to be a grown up, but I'll do it since I have to. Damned responsibilities.

1403,"&gt; A religious entity ruled all the known kings of the world for something like 1000 years. This kind of thing had never before happened and has not since happened.

Which religious entity, as a singular entity (as I believe you mean it), has ruled ""all the known kings of the world for something like 1000 years?"" Christianity has only affected a portion of the world. There were various other ""kings of the world"" for whom Christianity had little or no sway (China... the Mongols - who ruled the 2nd largest land empire EVER...) Keep in mind that the time period of which you are speaking was by no means monolithic. The various European nations were still practicing their own ""pagan"" religions (it's only pagan if it's a different religion than yours. To the forerunners of the Vikings, Christians would have been pagans.)

What geographic area do you mean by ""known kings of the world?"" To the average Egyptian serf, toiling in his fields, the ""known kings of the world"" would probably mean his local lord, maybe the Pharoah, and perhaps a few other kingdoms outside of his nation. To an Egyptian merchant, travelling the Mediterranean, the ""known kings of the world"" would include Rome, Israel, the north African coastal nations, possibly the Iberian peninsula, Greece... and if that merchant made his way into the Black Sea he would come across the Sarmatians, the Armenians...

Just think of the number of ""kings of the world"" there have been in the past 2,000+ years that Christianity has been around. Here's just a few (definitely not all-inclusive) of the larger kingdoms/empires near to Israel from roughly 1 CE to today:

1. The Parthian Empire (located [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire#/media/File:Parthian_Empire_at_it%27s_greatest_extent.png)) From roughly 247 BCE to 224 CE. Next door neighbors to the Israelites, essentially. Religion: Babylonian, Zoroastrianism.

2. Indo-Parthian Kingdom (located [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Parthian_Kingdom#/media/File:IndoParthianKingdom.svg)) From roughly 12 BCE to 130 CE. Religions: Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Ancient Greek (YO! Zeus is still in the hizz-ouse!)

3. Kushan Empire (located [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kushanmap.jpg).) Had diplomatic ties to the Roman Empire. Existed from roughly 30 CE to 375 CE. Religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, Shamanism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, various Bactrian-Indian religions.

4. Gupta Empire (located [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gupta_empire_map.png)) From roughly 200 CE to 550 CE. Religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism.

5. Let's get some Italian flair in here... Ostrogothic Kingdom (located [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogothic_Kingdom#/media/File:Ostrogothic_Kingdom.png)) From roughly 493 to 552. Religions: Arianism (among the Goths), Chalcedonian, Christianity (among the Romans.) I include this to show that the Roman Empire was not monolithic culturally or religiously for quite some time after the rise of Christianity.

6. Visigoth Kingdom (located [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigothic_Kingdom#/media/File:Visigothic_Kingdom.png)) From roughly 5th century CE to 8th century CE. Religions: Chalcedonian, Christianity, Arianism.

The reason I list the above is to show that in the Mediterranean, the surrounding areas, and in Europe, there was a steady shifting of kingdoms and religions. Even the Roman Empire was in flux through much of its history.
 
&gt; That discription of what he claims will happen later ONLY fits where the pope rises and then falls. Nowhere else.

I can fit that section of Revelation to damned near any kingdom and religion in history if I want to, and it won't take much effort on my part. It all depends on how you want to define ""known kings of the world"" and how you want to define what constitutes ""false religion"" and whose perspective you want to see that from. To the Shinto religions of Japan, Christianity would be false religion.

&gt; Yes there are powerful religions in history. There is even a religion ruling in the Middle East currently - but only during the crusades times and a short period before did a religion rule all the kings of the earth.

This is a problem of looking at the world through the lens of Christocentrism (I may have just made that word up.) There have been religions in the history of the world that dwarf Christianity. Hell, there are religions that dwarf it now. Also, there isn't *ONE* religion currently ruling in the Middle East. There are two denominations of Islam vying for control of the people there, there is a sizable Christian population, and there are various other religions scattered in there as well. It just happens that the two most powerful religions happen to be Islamic in nature. 1,000 years ago it would have been Zoroastrianism. Who knows what it will be 1,000 years from now?

As for the time of the Crusades... keep in mind that those spanned a period of time of *centuries.* In that time there have been many other religions in many other nations ruled by ""kings of the earth."" Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Shinto, animism, shamanism, Tengriism, Arianism, the Nordic gods, remnants of the Celtic gods... Even in the areas you seem to be focusing on (the Mediterranean and Europe) there were various religious groups. Christianity hasn't been a monolithic religion from almost the beginning. Schisms and sects have split it into three main groups, and many denominations even of those. Even for that you've got Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Protestantism. We can further subdivide those (especially Protestantism) if we choose. The Catholics hated the Orthodox, the Orthodox hated the Catholics, everyone hated the Protestants at first, and vice versa.
 
&gt; Nobody really challenged this rulership until the rise of the ottomans, whom the church pounded into the ground with their Templar armies and the help of the very kings they ruled over.

There is so much wrong on this, and I visited part of it above. Christianity isn't monolithic, it's been split into various forms. Even then, the Ottomans were very much a powerful nation throughout a good chunk of Europe's and the Mid-East's history. They most certainly did not get pounded into the ground by the Templar armies or by the Church (by which I assume you mean the Catholic Church.) They didn't really lose their empire until the 20th century. They were key players in World War I. They had dominated and controlled the eastern Mediterranean, parts of ancient Persia, much of Greece, Egypt, Arabia, and much of North Africa for centuries before their fall. The idea that the Catholic Church ""pounded"" them ""into the ground"" isn't even remotely historically accurate.
 
&gt; This continued until the consigning of the churches power to only Italy, and then not long after that only Vatican City.

You do realize that the Catholic Church is still the dominant Christian denomination, right? [It comprises roughly 50% of all Christians worldwide. 37% of Christianity is Protestant, and 12% are Orthodox Greek or Russian.](http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2012/dec/23/84-percent-world-population-has-faith-third-are-ch/)

Only about 31.5% of the world are Christian. 22.3% are Muslim, 15.35% are secular (nonreligious), 13.95% are Hindu, 5.5% are Chinese folk religions, 5.25% are Buddhist... the remaining percentages are various other religions.

1404,"&gt; It specifically identified Rome as the beast, followed by symbology that is specific and not vague, in that everyone who reads the bible knows that the harlot would represent religiosity. Even if you don't accept the 666 identification, a beast is a government - that's specific.

Numerical code was commonly used by oppressed Jews during the time period that John wrote his Revelation. Interesting note: there is a possibility of scribal mistranslation of the number, and it actually being 616, and not 666 as is currently used in the Bible.

That aside, [there are a number of interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast) of the Beast's number. John was engaging in politics here.

&gt; There may be hit and miss exceptions to this fact, but he wrote of a religious entity ruling all the kings of the earth. That's a significant thing to write about. And it happened.

This is a common thing, so it's not surprising that John would write of a religious entity as a ruler. Where do we begin?

1405,"&gt; does this present a possibility that the book of revelation is true, at least up to a point

Revelation is true in the same way that a science fiction novel is true: it takes some known quantities and extrapolates forward, utilizing symbology to get the author's point across to the reader. It's about as true as any doomsayer's predictions of the future.

The Book of Revelation reveals less about the future than it does the author's past. It's supposed to be, and purports to be, the future; however, what it really does is describe the present-day situation in Rome at the time of John. It is a piece of anti-Roman political propaganda which uses historical references (Daniel's visions) to bolster itself and support the early Christians being persecuted throughout Nero's empire at the time. Nero was one of the more vicious emperors in the history of Rome (which has a pretty bloody history even without him.) The Christians of the times needed to be buoyed up; they were under terrible persecution at the time.

The events described in Revelation that lead up to the end times are not specific to any time period. Children have *always* been disobedient to their parents. Things are *always* getting worse with every succeeding generation (""Back in my day we didn't do such and such, and we respected our elders! Bah!"") Kingdoms have *always* risen up against other kingdoms. There have *always* been wars and rumors of wars. Earthquakes, pestilences, poverty, famines have *always* been tribulations that people have had to deal with. There should be religious references in the symbology of Revelation... what the Jews and Christians were going through at that time was a religious war. It makes sense that John would want to see the dominant religious beliefs of his time to be ""devastated and naked"" - he and his fellows were being made devastated and naked themselves at the time, and he wants retribution.

Nothing in Revelation is specific to our day today. We have to stretch the symbology, often to the breaking point, to make it fit.

John wrote the book of Revelation utilizing a common practice of writers in his day: he used heavy poetic metaphors to get his message across. [The style of literature he wrote in is called *apocalyptic*](https://www.gci.org/bible/rev/apocalyptic) and means something a bit different than what is meant in common usage. The term itself is taken from the book of Revelation and applied to the other writings in that style that preceeded it. The style itself was in use between roughly 200 BC and 100 AD.

Note this:

&gt; Apocalyptic writings usually had certain characteristics in common. Writers generally claimed that a divine disclosure had been given through an angelic intermediary. God’s secret purpose was said to have been revealed through a dream or vision in the heavenly realm. Almost all apocalypses are pseudonymous. Writers of apocalyptic works usually wrote in the name of heroes from Israel’s history. There are books ascribed to Enoch, Abraham, the Twelve Patriarchs, Moses, Ezra, Enoch and Elijah, among others.

John had to write in apocalyptic style; to be plain-spoken would likely have led the Romans to him, whereupon he would have been enjoying the view from atop a cross or stake. He used language and imagery that only other Christians of his day would really get... that's part of the reason there are so many various interpretations of what Revelation really means among various Christian groups today.

Understand also that throughout the past 2,000 years, various religious sects have used Revelation to claim that their current times were the End Times, reinterpreting the book to fit the events of their days. This is nothing new.",2015-11-04 16:59:35+00:00,cwoaw3o,1.0,t3_3rhlez,13591.0,exjw

1419,"I think one of the most glaring examples of homophobia I recently saw was with my wife's family. Last winter, my mother (who is bisexual) and my second-mom (who is lesbian and helped raised me from the age of five onwards, minus a few years when my mother married my stepfather) visited us around the holidays. My wife's parents were going to be out of town and live about a mile from my house. When we approached them about the possibility of my parents using their home while they were gone, it was rejected due to my parents relationship. Apparently my father-in-law feels that you can catch the gay. What's strange is that he seems to actually like my parents... but he can't handle the idea of two old ladies sexing it up in his house (not that they would have, in all likelihood... at least, I prefer not to picture it.) I realize it's not nearly as bad as some of the examples others have mentioned in this thread (and not as bad as some of the stuff I've seen in the KH's I've been in), but it really struck home to me because it was directed at my parents, and it was so casually delivered.

I think that /u/caseyoc is right: Skype is probably not the best way to handle it.

An email or letter allows them to process first, and then you can continue in a more rational manner from there.

Use the same formula the elders use when handing down unpleasant news: tell them you love them, tell them why you love them, tell them your thoughts and feelings about the organization, explain your doubts and how you've spoken to the elders, and then close it up with the fact that you love and appreciate them and everything they've been to you in your life.

Hades was utterly implacable. Wikipedia actually has a good description of him:

&gt; Feared and loathed, Hades embodied the inexorable finality of death: ""Why do we loathe Hades more than any god, if not because he is so adamantine and unyielding?"" The rhetorical question is Agamemnon's. He was not, however, an evil god, for although he was stern, cruel, and unpitying, he was still just.

Of all the gods and goddesses, he seemed the least likely to engage in the fickle behavior that so characterized the others; when we think of Zeus we often think of a philandering sex addict. When we think of Ares, we see a temperamental and violent man given to fits of anger and uncontrollable rage. With Hera we often see a master manipulator. Poseidon is, pardon me here, mercurial in personality; he's as likely to send a helpful breeze as he is to get his knickers in a twist and sink your city beneath the waves. Aphrodite is shallow and vain. Apollo has a lot of generous qualities as a god of healing and protection (and was one of the most worshipped gods,) but also had a tendency of sending plagues. Hades largely just wants to be left alone to rule his kingdoms.

Hades tended to maintain balance. He was largely passive. Honestly, when we think about it, he really didn't need to be all that active. Eventually everything dies, and thus eventually everything comes to Hades realm and under his rule.",2015-10-29 18:00:51+00:00,cwheh69,10.0,t1_cwhcm4v,2594.0,exjw

You denied the elders closure.

They didn't get to finish their little kangaroo court. They didn't get to feel like they encouraged you to keep being a JW.

They didn't get to go through the motions of acting like they cared just to prove to themselves that they were good men making a hard decision. You didn't blow up at them, you didn't put them in a situation where they could get defensive and feel that they had to protect themselves from an emotional attack... you simply left. That one of them followed you, trying to get you to come back, shows that they were highly unsatisfied with how it turned out. They needed closure from you; it's like you were a jilted lover who realized their partner was abusive, and just suddenly gets up from the dinner table, walks out the front door, and never looks back. I'll bet money that they look back on that day and wonder what exactly happened, and if they are at all sincere men they probably feel torn about it.

/u/Scared890: This will likely be the reaction of the courts as well. Breaking and entering, placing surveillance devices, spying on a person *in their own home* without their knowledge and consent? This isn't like recording camera footage of a public place; you have a right to expect privacy within your own domicile. Nothing gathered though the ex's camera will be admissible in a court of law. The past history of abuse, assuming it can be corroborated with legal documentation, will sink just about any chance at gaining custody. Even if it can't be fully corroborated with police reports, etc. you have recent evidence (the B&amp;E, the camera, etc.) that ex-hubby is potentially dangerous. Just him breaking the law so egregiously should torpedo any chance he has at custody. He's living in dreamland if he thinks otherwise.

Unless there is something not being said here by the mother, such as an abusive environment in her home or obvious drug use (and there is no reason to believe there is given the information provided), then there isn't a snowball's chance in hell of the ex gaining full custody.

I've said it here in /r/exjw before, having some experience with divorce and an ex-wife who is a JW: **the courts don't give a damn about what your religion is.** If ex-hubby is trying to gain custody on the basis of religion, he's going to be shut down by the judge real quick. He cannot dictate to you what you practice, believe, or don't believe in your household; likewise you can't do that to him.

Don't believe the threats of the elders or ex-hubby. They are full of hot gas.

As everyone else here has said: **get a lawyer.** Fight this thing. Throw his sorry ass in jail. It's the only way to protect yourself and your child. If you don't do something about this **now,** then he will simply continue to behave this way. If you don't follow through, the courts will have no choice but to assume that you were ultimately okay with the surveillance and situation.

In my experience it generally takes about a year for them to really give up on you, though elder bodies from different areas and halls seem to handle things differently. You might be popping up on the congregation secretary's computer if he has alerts set up to check for service time in a spreadsheet or something.

Most congregation secretaries will notice if you are missing time around 3 months of inactivity. Anything prior to that might be due to inattention on your part (you probably forgot to turn in the slip.) At 6 months you're officially inactive, so 3 months gives them time to correct the issue and get you back in service (get you to toe the line.) When you add in circuit overseer visits, you have at least two times a year when the time slips are closely reviewed and they try to get people's time in order.

At about 6 months to a year after you stop submitting time slips they start getting gung-ho about finding out what happened to you and why you aren't in service anymore.

1511,"In light of some of the complaints (not unjustifiable complaints, either) elsewhere in this thread, I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not attacking anyone or their beliefs below, or at least that it isn't my intent. Anyone who has the desire or need to have a god in their lives is perfectly free to do so (as if you needed my permission, right?) and if it brings them comfort and fulfills them, then more power to them. Your words above simply kickstarted my brain into a direction it's gone in before.

&gt; It happens pretty regularly with many if not all groups.

One thing that has always bugged me has been why God has to rely on the interpretation of his thoughts by human beings. These same human beings are either just as imperfect as you or I are, or they are somehow magically transformed into infallible representatives of God. However, we have to have faith that what they are saying is completely accurate and represents the actual thoughts and words of their deity.

This provides a means by which those representatives can abuse their power. They are holy men; you aren't allowed to question them, because to do so is heresy (especially in earlier centuries and millennia, if not as much today), and is often punishable by rather horrific forms of torture and death in order to absolve you of that sin and save your soul for heaven.

Why is this the arrangement? I can think of many ways to circumvent, pervert, and otherwise abuse the position of God's spokesman. If God really wants us to follow him, if he really has a set of rules and regulations designed to keep us in his grace and to please him, then why rely on the vagueries of human beings who may or may not have the best interests of their fellow man at heart? Instead, why not make certain that all of humanity got the ineffable message and word of God, regardless of location on Earth, of gender, of race, and of time period. Why rely on oral stories and traditions? Why transition them to one particular people's language (especially since there are apparently several ""one true peoples"" on Earth, making it rather hard to separate who is or isn't God's real followers) and then handicap the rest of humanity by forcing them to interpret an unfamiliar language? Why force us to translate those Godly words from one language to another, which is imperfect at best since much of the syntax in which those words are structured provides them with much of their meaning, and this is easily lost through translation errors or the inability of one language to accurately portray the actual words of another?

I would think that if God really wanted all of humanity to follow him, and that if he had certain rules and regulations to keep man from sinning (or at least outlining what sin was so it could be avoided as much as possible) then there are better ways than relying on clergy or holy men to get the point across. For a person who can create all of reality and the universe from just his mind, and who can apparently create vast amounts of material and suspend natural forces at whim, I would think that perhaps creating a hologram that can be seen from every point on Earth in every language that humanity speaks, and one that would be intelligible to anyone who would look at it regardless of literacy, that this would fix all of the problems of translation errors, lost manuscripts, and holy men abusing their privilege and power. Then you can truthfully say that you are giving all of mankind a chance to follow you if you are God. You are providing all people the same chance and opportunity to simply read what you placed in the sky above their heads. Freedom of personal will is addressed; you aren't forcing human beings to follow you, you are simply providing them with a clear and concise Terms and Conditions document that is readily available to them at any time they choose to refer to it. You are also insuring that there is nothing lost in translation or interpretation; the words are right there, and anyone can access and understand it.

At least, it makes sense to me that this is one possible solution if there is a particular God who wants us to worship him according to his requirements.",2015-10-15 17:05:17+00:00,cw0tj3p,4.0,t1_cw0s090,2192.0,exjw

1518,"&gt; So Jehovah has the power to stop cancer, doesn't. Has the power to change the child abuse policy of his very own organization, doesn't. Has the power to keep people from committing suicide or killing others, doesn't.

You miss the point though. Jehovah allows all these things and all the other things in the world because he needs to show Satan that his dick is bigger than the devil's in their cosmic measuring contest (w10 11/15 p. 28.) After all, if everyone doesn't acknowledge God's ample penis size, then they all have to die, and Jah doesn't want to do that when he can simply force everyone to worship his schlong.

&gt; By lying and turning Adam and Eve away from God, Satan called into question Jehovah’s right to require obedience of mankind. Moreover, by inducing the first human pair to disobey God, Satan also called into question the loyalty of all intelligent creatures. As revealed in the case of Job, who was loyal to Jehovah’s sovereignty, Satan claimed that he could turn all humans away from God.

Ultimately the entire ""it's about the right of universal sovereignty and who has it"" excuse used by religions (and the Watchtower because they hammer it so much) is really all about dominance and  power plays; i.e. penis envy.",2015-10-15 14:52:34+00:00,cw0o536,4.0,t1_cw0i6ys,13525.0,exjw

1527,"&gt; What would you say was the biggest factor that contributed to you waking up?

Whew... lots of little things building up over a long period of time, perhaps. I was a convert; I started studying around 16-ish, and got baptized around 18. There's lots of reasons I converted (most of them bad.) Basically I became a JW looking for stability and normality... which kind of tells you that my pre-JW life was pretty fucked (physical, mental, sexual abuse, neglect, social outcast.)

I was always a geek and nerd. I love science, history, and gaining knowledge. There was always a high level of cognitive dissonance between what I knew was factual and what the Society taught. I've always been wracked with doubts and questions, but because of thoughts of ""I'm imperfect, this is just imperfection or my Satanic, fleshly tendencies speaking,"" I worked hard to submerge my doubts and questions. It didn't really work well, but I was still sincere in my desire to be a good little JW.

My family had a series of what were to us catastrophic events that really began shaking up our world views. Once the cracks began appearing, once my doubts and questions became too much to ignore, and once I started to really see and acknowledge the hypocrisy and outright corruption in the Society that I had tried to ignore for years, then the dam kind of broke. I had looked at apostate websites years before but had been scared off by the vitriol and what I thought of at the time as lies (and having looked at them since my awakening I will say that some of them are still full of shit.)

Once I had really begun waking up I stumbled across /r/exjw on Reddit (I was a brand new Reddit lurker at the time.) This place had a lot of vitriol too (as should be expected from a survivors support group,) but it was more even-handed if that makes sense... there was less of the reactionary ""I made a JW cry today"" bullshit and less of the conspiracy type rantings here (ahem... Mike and Kim...) I also liked that /r/exjw doesn't try to be the end-all and be-all authority of everything ex-Jehovah's Witness, but rather points the users to useful information and other informative exJW websites; the sidebar (and most especially JWFacts.com) was absolutely invaluable to me. A number of users here have also helped me accept what I learned and process it. I owe a number of people here a huge debt of gratitude, and the list keeps getting deeper the longer I'm on this subreddit.

And now I'm here. Two years later here on Reddit, and about three or four years after I began the process of really waking up.",2015-10-15 13:30:15+00:00,cw0ld84,3.0,t1_cw0kd7r,2171.0,exjw

1540,"But a TIE would have to be able to achieve escape velocity (or just under it) in relation to the Earth's gravity in order to get away from our planet, right? All the combat footage we have of TIE's seem to indicate they are extra-orbital spacecraft; they are definitely interplanetary capable, even if they aren't interstellar capable spaceships.

[Earth's escape velocity is 11.2 km/s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity) The max speed (in the atmosphere) of [an AIM 54 Phoenix missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-54_Phoenix) is only 1.702 km/s ([Mach 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number)), meaning the TIE has an in-atmosphere advantage of at least 6.6x the velocity of a Phoenix missile if it can achieve escape velocity (ignoring the fact that at that speed, the TIE is wandering off into the void rather than [doing a flyby of Top Gun's control tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGGhLihDmFk) without permission.)

Even if a TIE cannot achieve Earth escape velocity, in order to be a spacecraft it still has to be able to achieve orbit. [The space shuttle \(and International Space Station\) would orbit Earth at about 8 km/s.](https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/) This is still 4.7x the speed of a Phoenix missile.

We can make the argument that you probably wouldn't try to fly your TIE at 8 km/s (orbital speed of the shuttle) in atmo, but there is no reason it shouldn't be able to achieve 4 or 5 km/s speeds I would think. Even if you slowed it down, I cannot think that the TIE would fly slower than the [X-15 \(which was capable of exceeding 100 km, and thus achieving spaceflight per the international definition of spaceflight\),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15) which had a top speed of 7,274 km/h (Mach 6.72 - 2.02 km/s). That gives you a space-capable craft that can get you to the upper limits of Earth's atmosphere (in near-vacuum) and then you can boost up to your orbital and escape velocities (to take care of that whole ""disintegrating while moving really, really fast in a fluid environment"" problem that a TIE likely has.)

So unless you were intentionally flying as slow as possible to play games and have fun with your opponent ([...goddammit, Maverick...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPxDoFbsvWA#t=1m34s)), your TIE shouldn't come close to being in danger of getting shot down by an F-14 Tomcat.",2015-10-09 16:57:15+00:00,cvtvbmq,4.0,t1_cvts778,4696.0,AskScienceFiction

1596,"I enjoyed this article from [Kids Without God.](http://kidswithoutgod.com/teens/ask/where-do-atheists-get-their-morality/)

Where do I personally get my morals? From the same place most of us got them: parents, teachers, society at large. I try to treat other people as I want to be treated. The Golden Rule has been around a lot longer than concepts of God.

In a nutshell: morality is present in *all* societies in some form, regardless of religious belief. There were moral people and moral codes around long before the Hebrews decided to borrow a storm and war god and change him around a bit, and far longer before this other guy decided that people should be nice to one another and got nailed to a tree/stake/cross for his trouble.

Also, morals differ somewhat from society to society and from time period to time period. We consider it highly immoral to rape a woman in today's society, and it's a crime that carries significant prison time; the biblical Hebrews went into great detail on how to deal with thieves and that the punishment for stealing livestock was death, but that rape of a young girl could be remedied by marrying her to her rapist. Today there are lots of things we find repugnant, reprehensible, and outright immoral, but nowhere in the Ten Commandments does it say ""Don't abuse children,"" or ""Don't enslave people,"" or ""Don't rape each other.""

Morals are an ever-changing, ever-evolving code of conduct. There are some commonalities to morals across most societies and with most people, however. Morals arise from the constant development of culture; they are birthed in laws and guidelines that help create and foster peaceful society, and one can argue that they may even be evolved from social conduct required of us when we were little more than herd animals ourselves. Morality, or it's forebear, has possibly been around since we were little more than ape-like primates wandering around the wilds of Africa and sharing vegetation with our tribe mates. It may have descended from instinctual animal behavior, and just by virtue of our brain complexity might have eventually evolved into the various sets of codified values and laws we are familiar with today. Morals are simply the social glue that holds people together in groups. Make the group larger and more complex, and morals likewise have to become more complex as well.",2015-09-24 15:32:34+00:00,cvcmym8,1.0,t3_3m7e68,2490.0,exjw

Let's ignore history as well. Pope Benedict XVI went to Washington, DC and New York in 2008. Pope John Paul II visited in 1999, 1995, 1993, 1987, 1984, 1981, and 1979. Pope Paul VI visited in 1965.

In all, there have been 10 papal visits including this one (that I could find). But this is the one that spells the end of this system of things.

1609,"&gt; Do you guys ever pull the lid off and show them some real life examples of what you or others went through?

Some. Our oldest (1 of 4) knows some of the things that we've dealt with, having been old enough and mature enough to understand what he was hearing when my wife and I spoke about them between ourselves. He has never really shown all that much interest in the organization; when we were uber-Dubs we would encourage him towards baptism and he very passively resisted (we are thankful for this now, though back then we feared for his everlasting life.) We don't really have to discuss things with him too much; he was leery of the changes at first when we stopped going to meetings, but he was rather apathetic towards it when we were in so he adapted quickly and, I think, gratefully. Holidays were hard for him to accept at first, then he realized he gets stuff. Avarice is apparently a balm to the conscience.

With 2 of 4 (my daughter) we have to be a bit more circumspect than with 1 of 4; a lot of what happened with us is directly tied to her biological mother, her stepfather, and her mother's family, as well as how that was mishandled in the congregation. As she gets older, a little bit more comes to light, but I'm probably not going to go into all the sordid details. She shouldn't have to deal with that... it's too much like being asked to side with one parent or another, and no child should be placed in that situation. If she asks me things, then I'm bluntly honest, but I don't volunteer a whole lot. I won't give her mother the leverage to say in court that I'm sabotaging her relationship with my daughter. I spend more time working with her, but that's mainly because her biomom attempts to indoctrinate her. I have to offset that.

As for the younger two kids, the youngest doesn't remember the organization at all and wouldn't really know what a Jehovah's Witness was if you asked him, and 3 of 4 barely remembers it.

Then there is a lot of stuff that just won't apply to them, like how I got ensnared by the Witnesses in the first place, etc. That all ties into my eventual awakening, but it's stuff that they just don't need to know.

I do a number of small things, much like how I did with my wife when I woke up before she did. For instance, at 4 of 4's birthday party this past weekend, I whispered to my daughter ""You know if your mother found out you were having this much fun and participating this much in a birthday party, even your little brother's birthday party, that she and her family would birth angry kittens, right?""

I also tend to attack doctrinal issues, the history of religion in general, and other things. As an example, 2 of 4 had a homework assignment for school dealing with various religious systems that are followed or have been followed throughout history and their basic beliefs and origins (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shinto, Taoism, Confucianism, etc.) and we had a long conversation detailing the rise of Christianity and Judaism from polytheistic Canaanite religions. In this I hope that she realizes that religion in general is a man-made construct, and not some divine system; luckily I'm aided in that she is interested in various other cultures and beliefs (notably interested in Buddhism) and shows interest in science as well as social studies. I do something similar with 1 of 4.",2015-09-23 19:36:48+00:00,cvbpng2,4.0,t1_cvbnuo1,2508.0,exjw

I find this is a problem with my own kids sometimes. They just don't get it, and it's largely because my wife and I (even when we were super active and ""in"") protected them from a lot of the stuff that other JW's did or the Society mandated, even if we did have our own foibles as well. Even at our most uber-Dubbish, we were pretty liberal-minded for the most part... for a JW. It frustrates us when we have them say something to the effect of ""it wasn't so bad."" Yes. Yes it was. We just made sure **you** didn't need to deal with it; we took care of it in the background.

Add to that the fact that our daughter is undergoing the indoctrination and love-bombing from her JW bio-mom's family, and you get frequent bouts of ""why can't you see this for what it is? Stop defending them,"" on our part.

On the one hand, it's frustrating for us that they don't see the evil in the organization.

What they do, however, is link the camps to evil worldly governments, then describe how those governments will persecute faithful Witnesses. Then there are all the stories told from concentration camp survivors and how they were thrown into the camps solely because of their faith and loyalty to Jehovah. Looking further into the literature (it helps to have the Watchtower Library CD... mine is from 2010, so I don't have the newest one, but it suffices) you see thousands of references to concentration camps and how they were used to attack and persecute JW's. Likewise for other prisons, methods of torture, etc.

The Watchtower Society is a master of the use of *implication* without directly stating what it is they want you to think. They draw parallels between what the Witnesses faced in Nazi Germany and the persecution they state is upcoming. They paint the tribulation as a horrific period of time in which the governments will turn on JW's. They conceptualize that JW's *could* face torture and death... and then they talk about how the faith of concentration camp survivors helped them through their catastrophe.

This all leaves aside and ignores how often public speakers at congregations, circuit assemblies, and conventions state that JW's may face time in concentration camps in the upcoming Tribulation.

It's highly disingenuous for a JW to imply that the Society has never stated that concentration camps are a possibility for JW's in the Great Tribulation.

Thank you for this! This is quite informative.

To make sure I understand effective combat width calculation properly: I would take the base value, add in the tech value for my max combat width. Then I adjust that value by the modifier for terrain.

    For example:

    15 base value, and a tech value of 9 to get a max CW of 24. Fighting in hills for a modifier of -25%. Effective CW = 18 units.

From here I get really fuzzy on what to do. If the opposing army has 10 units in total, what do I need to do to be able to flank him?

1699,"&gt; I'm having issues choosing who to vote for in Canada.

Write in Bernie Sanders. You won't regret it. Or Palpatine/Vader 2015. I'm a big fan of theirs as well.

As for corporations and taxation, my knowledge and experience in that area isn't very good. I will say that I think the American tax system (and I imagine Canada isn't much better) needs thorough overhauling and a complete reformation. I can't speak with any authority on corporate taxes, but I do know that middle class America is being completely devastated by taxation, shrinking wages, and far fewer economic opportunities than it had in the past. Hell, from a personal perspective, I'm a fan of flat taxation with no exemptions. Make everyone, regardless of income or social position pay a flat tax rate on any income rates. As I understand it (and I may be wrong here) a flat tax rate of roughly 20% here in the US would bring in the same amount of money as we have now, or possibly more. That is far less than what I pay as a member of the middle class, is more than what many of the 1% or the lower class pays, and seems pretty even-handed. The idea of the Fair Tax plan, what I understand of it, also has appeal to me; make a Federal sales tax, abolish income and corporate taxes, dismantle the IRS (because you don't need one if you're only handling sales taxes), and no exemptions (because sales tax.) To avoid fucking over the poor and making them suffer the brunt of the Fair Tax, adopt the prebate system that covers taxes on necessities.

The nice thing is that both methods have been proven in other countries. There is immediate downside in the transition to either plan, but that will work itself out rather quickly, and the benefits should rapidly outweigh the downsides. It strengthens the economy by eliminating much or all of the corporate taxation we currently have, while increasing the overall pool of money to draw taxes from.

Regardless, what we're currently doing isn't working. Or it is, but it's limping along, mortally wounded and bleeding out all over the place. But again, I have no expertise in this area, so I may be completely off-base above.",2015-09-16 19:30:49+00:00,cv3u4tx,2.0,t1_cv3r67x,4288.0,exjw

1758,"I agree with you, and I thought after posting my previous comment that I should also point out how much religious fervor has destroyed, especially regarding historical and cultural artifacts. One has only to look at the modern day ISIS destroying ancient religious art and artifacts, cultural emblems that have withstood thousands of years of erosion and humanity's ham-fisted behaviors, only to be destroyed today with the application of explosives and ignorance. The Basilica in Rome was once a paragon of pagan temples; it's been resculpted and defaced many times by Christian adherents since then; how much of the original statuary survives? How many paintings, carvings, and other culturally important works have been destroyed by religious zealots throughout the world? Imagine if the Crusaders of medieval Europe had taken a detour through Cambodia and seen the pagan temples hidden in the jungles... would Angkor Wat survive the experience from men who ripped through the Italian peninsula and cast down pagan images in their orgy of godly destruction?

Galileo might have expanded the vistas of human understanding of the cosmos were it not for the Catholic Church. Yes, Isaac Newton was strongly religious; however, that had little or nothing to do with his formulation of calculus and the theory of gravity. Darwin is vilified throughout the world because of religious people. Camille Pagalia states the following:

&gt; All the great world religions contain a complex system of beliefs regarding the nature of the universe and human life that is far more profound than anything that liberalism has produced.

I feel that if she truly believes this, then the problem lies with her. It's her own imagination that seems to be limited here. The concept that life arose from organic molecules, slowly, over hundreds of millions of years (which the human mind does not seem truly able to encompass), and then developed slowly through hundreds of millions more, to branch off, to overcome adversity of mind-numbing proportions, to squeak its way through insane amounts of competition, to eventually meander and wander it's way down to our day and the chuckle of a baby learning how to play with a stuffed bear... that's profound to me. The idea that hundreds of millions of years of life cascaded down to you, to me, and to everything we know in the Earth today that is alive... that is profound. To imagine that at some point in the past, I am related to the very same trees that I used to climb in as a child... *that is profound.* To know that someday, in the distant future (assuming humanity has managed to stave off extinction, which is no sure thing) that I will be the progenitor of something else that may or may not be human... **that is awesomely profound.**

The whirling expanse of the cosmos, with its drifting gas, rocks, planets, moons, stars, stellar systems, nebula, supernova, stellar clusters, galaxies, galaxy groups, and the entire grapevine-like conglomeration of the known universe is profound. And, but for the efforts of humans who set out to learn what was beyond the thought-stopping excuse of ""it's a diving mystery"" uttered by the religions of the world, we might not have known that those shiny points of light above us were anything other than holes in a black cloth surrounding a flat earth. All of these concepts, all of these advances in human knowledge, have come about through ""liberal"" thought... if it had been left up to the conservative thinkers of those days we would still be growing seed by poking holes in the dirt with a stick for farming.

If Camille Pagalia cannot see the profound universe around us that ""liberalism"" throughout the ages has provided, then she is blind.

I cannot think of a single advancement that humanity has made, or a hurdle of knowledge that humanity has leapt, that required religion in order to happen.",2015-08-31 21:14:08+00:00,cum9vpl,3.0,t1_cum4bq2,8414.0,exjw

1760,"&gt;  I don’t believe there is a God, but I respect every religion deeply.

Whew, I'm glad she said that. [Pastafarians](http://www.venganza.org/) everywhere can breathe a sigh of relief that at least one person out there respects their stand on spaghetti.

I wonder... when Muslim imams teach their followers to become suicide bombers, should I respect that? Should I respect that orthodox Judaism prays the following during their morning prayers?

&gt; “Blessed are you, Lord, our God, ruler of the universe who has not created me a woman.”

When Christian faith healers allow children to die from perfectly treatable illnesses, should I respect that as well? Should I likewise respect religions that continue to tell their followers that this world, the one they live in, really doesn't matter but the next world, the afterlife, which no one can definitively state exists, should be their primary concern?

Or perhaps I should respect the religions that state that family should cut off their loved ones who don't believe exactly as they do, or who have decided that the religions of their births (or the religions of their conversions) are not for them?

Maybe I should respect the religion that teaches that it's okay to use children as martyrs in their spiritual war against unseen demonic entities?

I recognize and celebrate that religion has done some impressive things throughout history, and I believe we shouldn't take away the great works it has accomplished in the fields of art, architecture, and other areas that have positively impacted mankind. However, to turn a blind eye to the horrors it has likewise perpetrated is the height of selective memory; in doing that, we only want to focus on the good, the respectful, and the highlights of religions whilst ignoring the depraved, the evil, and the lowlights?

To me, that is wrong. That is the message that atheists like Dawkins, Hitchens, and Harris have tried to proclaim. There are millions of moderates out there like Pagalia apologizing for the past of religion; there are far, far fewer willing to point out where it fails. I may not always like the tone that Dawkins, Hitchens, and Harris use (especially Dawkins... there is something about his speaking that makes me think he's looking down his supercilious nose at anyone who doesn't believe as he does); hell, there are times when they make me cringe. For that matter, those three men have had public falling outs with one another on occasion when one of them has said something ludicrous (I'm thinking of Dawkins association with the ""Brights Movement,"" which Hitchens lambasted.)  However, for Pagalia to critique them as being adolescent when her article reads as a ""look at me, not them, I'm the cool one here!"" piece (where she makes the claim that she ""started the fad for"" publicly proclaiming oneself as an atheist comes to mind) which screams of hypocrisy to me. That said, there are points she makes in the article that I agree with... for instance, finding it hypocritical that some in academe or media demand understanding of Muslim beliefs while being derisive of others. I also agree that sneering can be ridiculous, and that it can be a huge turn off. As for who and what she finds funny (she likes Lenny Bruce, but doesn't like John Stewart?), all I can say is that humor is subjective from person to person, and what one finds funny another might not. But to behave as if snark-loving humorists are somehow *lesser* comedians, or that people who enjoy that are somehow less sophisticated than Pagalia herself is hubris.

I think she's rather busy promoting her own book and trying to differentiate herself from other prolific atheist writers. For all her protestations against other people ""sneering at dad,"" she certainly seems to be doing the same.

A lot depends on the size of your congregation, how overworked your elders are, how observant your service coordinator and congregation secretary are, etc.

None of the following is anything official, just my observations on how things are perceived by the brothers and how they might be handled; everyone's mileage may vary.

Missed service reports:

Month 1: Probably due to an oversight on the publisher, if the secretary even notices it.

Month 2: Did the publisher forget to put in his time again? I wonder what's up? Maybe I should mention it to him/her?

Month 3: A habit is forming. Is the publisher forgetting to input his/her service time, or are they not going out for some reason? Is everything alright in their lives? Maybe a word of encouragement is needed, or a question if there is something we can do to help. If the secretary is overworked and the congregation is large, then this is right around the time he should begin noticing that something is amiss.

Month 4: Concerning. This is right around the time of the CO visit, most likely (just because the CO visits 2 times a year normally) and the elders are reviewing congregation records. Something will likely be said right around this time. Obviously something is amiss. Find out if the publisher is okay, find out if they are simply forgetting their time sheets, rectify the situation if possible.

Month 5: Very concerning. You're most likely on someone's radar by now. Questions and encouragement will likely be forthcoming.

Month 6: You are now officially inactive, according to the Branch records as well as the congregation's records. Mobilize the elders, something is amiss!

1787,"It's just a philosophical system. It's certainly not a religion. There are various other philosophical systems out there; humanism appeals to me simply because it's so open ended and seems to focus on a general ""good of mankind"" motif. It's not as if I have a disciplined approach to it or anything, I just think that overall we have the ability and responsibility to improve the lot of humankind in general, and that we also have responsibilities to society and the natural world around us. Taking an Ethics course (basically moral philosophy) in college a few years back convinced me as I was beginning to awaken from the Borg than mankind doesn't need God in order to be a moral creature. Plus, I tend to be a very analytical kind of person, given to research and education, all of which dovetails nicely into humanism.

I lean towards [secular humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism) since I'm an atheist. It's kind of a position of default for me though; I didn't actively look for some type of philosophical doctrine. I just found that, after a lot of thought, I identified with a lot of the following:

&gt; Secular humanism posits that human beings are capable of being ethical and moral without religion or a god. It does not, however, assume that humans are either inherently evil or innately good, nor does it present humans as being superior to nature. Rather, the humanist life stance emphasizes the unique responsibility facing humanity and the ethical consequences of human decisions. Fundamental to the concept of secular humanism is the strongly held viewpoint that ideology—be it religious or political—must be thoroughly examined by each individual and not simply accepted or rejected on faith. Along with this, an essential part of secular humanism is a continually adapting search for truth, primarily through science and philosophy. Many Humanists derive their moral codes from a philosophy of utilitarianism, ethical naturalism, or evolutionary ethics, and some, such as Sam Harris, advocate a science of morality.",2015-08-29 17:32:11+00:00,cujvxdf,10.0,t1_cujv3ex,1572.0,exjw

1796,"&gt; On the other hand, reading about certain situations (like the WWII German concentration camps, among others) does raise the question - why didn't the people revolt en masse? Their numbers were large enough to overwhelm their captors.

I promise I will bring about my long-winded reply into how the WT controls JW's below. There will also be a TL;DR at the end ('cuz I'm polite like that.)

There have actually been quite a few things written about subjects like this. Understand that prisons, concentration camps, ghettos, and the like are institutional systems designed for the isolation and control of elements of the population. They could be called a science in and of themselves; there is a lot of applied psychology that goes into their functioning (but then again, as a former university professor of mine put it, when it comes to humans *everything* is psychology.) Also understand that I'm lumping in modern prisons with things like concentration camps; I'm doing this to highlight the institutional system of things... most corrections officers (at least, in the US, Canada, and Europe) are nowhere near as bad as the guards in charge of Nazi concentration camps were (there are always some exceptions, on both sides of that equation.)

Part of it boils down to the level of control the jailers have over their captives: though a guard might be highly outnumbered by the prisoners, he has force multipliers (weapons and training) that creates a situation in which the prisoners likely won't prevail if they do riot. Additionally, they are in an environment which gives advantages to the guards over the prisoners: sure, you might get the guys that are on the floor or the yard, but the guards in the control centers, the towers, the walls, outside the fences are pretty much beyond your reach as a prisoner... and they can retaliate swiftly and brutally against prisoner uprisings. Here in the States you'll have prison riots and uprisings in which it seems the prisoners get the upper hand for a while; however, the key part of that is that it's only *for a while.* Eventually they get worn down and overcome, even if it sometimes takes days; this is a product of US prisons being loath (through laws and custom) to use deadly force unless absolutely necessary to bring about control to the situation and of course their desire to avoid bad press and publicity in overcoming a riot or uprising. Nazi Germany didn't labor under those same constraints when it came to the concentration camps; there were prisoner uprisings, but they were typically dealt with swiftly and extremely harshly. Camp guards were extremely brutal (I'm generalizing a bit here, but the evidence stands that the majority of the camps just weren't very nice places to be a prisoner at) and effective at using that brutality to cow the prisoners into obedience. Basically, the guys with the guns control the group. When was the last time you could say that you ever saw a successful prison uprising? I mean success as in the prisoners were able to overcome the guards and get out of the prison... it's quite rare.

That's the practical side of things. For the mental side of things, think about how those institutions are structured. There is something inherently depressing about institutional facilities; you are a captive, and your brain knows it. This is true of prisons, of concentration camps, and of dreary workplaces all over the world. Please note, I'm not trying to equate workplaces to concentration camps, but rather suggesting something that we might have in common that provides a glimpse of the soul crushing depression that a prison institution might evoke.

Prisons are not happy places. They are generally pretty drab. There are security fences topped with razor or barbed wire everywhere a prisoner might travel. There are bars or high-strength (bulletproof) glass on the cells. There is a severe lack of privacy. There are very few places you can go without permission from the guards: you cannot go outside, you cannot go to the mess hall, you cannot go between cell blocks, you cannot go to the exercise facilities, you cannot go to the library or the media center without being *allowed* to go by the guards. You can be rousted out of bed or cell at any time by the guards so they can search for contraband. You are housed with a variety of other people who are not the nicest folks around. You are degraded, dehumanized, and treated oftentimes as subhuman (by both other prisoners as well as guards.) Everything in the system is designed to make certain that you know your place in the world: you are a bad person who has done bad things require you to be incarcerated and to lose the rights you have grown up with. And that's in American prisons, which are far nicer by comparison to many other prison systems around the world (don't get incarcerated in third world nations), and far nicer than the concentration camps of Nazi Germany.

Additionally, it's easier to contemplate the odds of a prisoner uprising when we know that we won't be the ones staring down the gun barrels when the guards begin shooting. Even if we know that eventually we might be headed to the gas chambers or might be killed at a guard's whim, at least for today we are alive... and life to most people is precious, and might even be more so when it hangs by a string over a razor's edge.

How this equates to JW's:

JW's labor in an environment of control: behavioral, information, thought, and environmental (BITE) control are key parts of how the Society makes its members toe the corporate line. Through indoctrination techniques, threats, and reprisals for actions not fitting in with the dictates of the Society, they cement this control over people quite firmly. Think of how this compares with prisons: inmates behavior and environment are controlled quite closely, though access to information and thought control is not concentrated on quite as much (you do have rehabilitation efforts, but this is arguably done in order to try to make an antisocial person a productive member of society at large.) In the Watchtower Society, you are constantly inundated with teachings designed to convince you that you need to only read their informative materials, that you should only associate with fellow believers, that everything outside the Society is dangerous, demonic, and opposed to God (who loves you so much that he gives you this perfect organization that will hold you close, etc.) If you doubt, if you question, if you take action to break free (uprising) then actions are taken to limit the damage you may cause, to get you back in your cell, or to ""execute"" you (through disfellowshipping or disassociation). The Watchtower is very much an institutional construct, and as such it has controls and processes in place to deal with anything that might disrupt the institution. Granted, the Society doesn't literally kill you, but the effects of DF'ing and DA'ing are similar: you are dead to your former family and friends, and your entire support system is forcibly removed from you.

**TL;DR:** Prisons, concentration camps, and institutional systems (as you can argue the Watchtower Society is) utilize methods of intimidation, control, and reprisal to keep their inmates (or members) in line. Rebellion, uprising, etc. is dealt with swiftly and harshly. These things are designed to prevent people from escaping.",2015-08-29 16:35:48+00:00,cuju57w,6.0,t1_cujs6ei,3669.0,exjw

Very good point! This is one in which that evidence from the Society's literature regarding blood transfusions will be helpful. The Society tries to wiggle around it by using terms such as ""we value quality healthcare,"" and other weasel words; using the blood brochure or articles detailing the abstinence from blood doctrines will help immensely. You want control of medical care if necessary; the court will likely state something to the effect of you parents conferencing and coming to agreeable terms about healthcare.

1828,"Want some good news? I can offer some, as an exJW parent who has to share custody with his JW ex-wife.

**The court doesn't give a damn what your beliefs are or are not.**

They will **not** award full custody based on your religious preference. Your exwife will have to prove that you are an unfit parent, and your religious outlook really doesn't impact that.

The court is going to be more concerned with what **type** of parent you are. Are you loving? Do you provide a stable home (obviously some leeway will be given regarding moving due to the breakup)? Do you provide food, shelter, clothing? Are you available to your children? If you are working, do you make certain they have adequate child care?

The only way to lose custody of your children is if you agree to your exwife's terms for some reason, if you are an addict or alcoholic, or if you pose a threat to your kids well-being (eg. you are abusive and it can be demonstrated through police reports, child services investigations, etc.)

**Your religious beliefs don't matter.** Welcome to the protections afforded you by the US constitution. You could be a convert to another church... the court doesn't care. You could have changed your religious views to Buddhism... the court doesn't care. You can be an open atheist... the court doesn't care. You might raise some eyebrows if you turn to Satanism, but even then the court isn't supposed to care (if you turn to Satanism, I'd keep it on the downlow if I were you just to be safe.)

Unless you've given concrete reasons for the court to take custody from you, it will not happen. Not in today's society. The system has gone through a ton of changes, even in the 12+ years I've had primary custody (for one thing, it's no longer called primary custody, and for another thing, it's really difficult to get anything other than a 50/50 or a 60/40 split on time anymore.)

Go ahead and gather what information you can on the religion and how it views things that are potentially impactful on children, such as the blood doctrines, holidays, need to be ""no part of this world,"" etc. Gather information showing the systematic problems facing them with child abuse. It's good to have that ammunition if you need it; however, you likely won't need to use it.

Oh, and before I forget:

**LAWYER THE FUCK UP.** Biggest mistake you can make is not getting an attorney. He should be a mid-range priced attorney, most likely. If you can afford the best and most expensive, then get him... but given the info about the EBT card, you'll probably not be able to do this. So do the next best thing and get a mid-range attorney; s/he'll be all that you likely need. The goal isn't to crush your ex-wife, the goal is to protect your parental rights.

Edit: Your position is terrifying to any loving father or mother. I know, I've been there. Getting an attorney to walk you through this and protect yourself is vital. You'll be okay as long as your nose is clean. If it isn't, then the attorney will help you to clean it up as best as possible and get you the best deal you can get. Your ex will not get sole custody; it just doesn't happen like that for no good reason anymore.

Edit 2: Dammit, almost forgot... document absolutely everything, if possible. Try to keep communication in written forms (email is far preferable to texting, if for no other reason than the permanence of it.) Obviously verbal communication is necessary... so keep a small journal handy to document things that are said, agreements made, arguments had. Try to keep a calm and cool head about things at all times; don't fly off the handle. Demonstrate that you are the logical, level headed parent, especially when she tries to push your buttons or gets argumentative. DO NOT TRY TO SABOTAGE HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KID. Document the hell out of it if/when she tries to sabotage YOUR relationship with your child. Become an avid record keeper: record and save receipts for things you buy or use for your child, keep records of phone calls (time and duration, as well as tone), visitation records (at least up until you have a set, court approved schedule.) A lot of this will be unnecessary, but you never know what might help defend you, *especially if she starts inventing arguments and crap that doesn't happen.*

You'll be good man. I might also suggest taking a parenting/custody course (many states mandate this in divorces.) Listen, take notes, take it to heart. Don't freak out about the scare stories on the internet; most of them are bullshit in some form or other. The divorce is really simple to the court unless you both make it complicated: the court wants to make sure there is compromise, that the child's best interests are protected, and that his/her family life is as normal as can be given the circumstances. They don't care too much about you or your exwife, just the child. This is a good thing.",2015-08-27 20:44:09+00:00,cuhw1zd,1.0,t3_3in0lc,2572.0,exjw

Given what you've stated about your parents, I'd be really reticent about telling them anything as well. Also given what you've stated about your parents and your relationship with them, are you sure you even want to tell them? I don't think anyone (other than those narcissists) would blame you if you didn't. Especially if you didn't tell your father.

Your father has some really deep seated mental issues. I don't think narcissism actually covers it; he's showing signs of paranoia, delusional behavior, and a slew of other things. He might be narcissistic, but I think his actual disorder is something else entirely. I'd be tempted to tell him to just do it if he threatened suicide again, but I'm a heartless bastard about being manipulated like that.

1839,"So what about a situation like that my wife and I have? We faded, more or less. I don't believe there is any way we could be counted as a stuck-in.

* No more meetings or field service, and haven't participated in the same for roughly two years now.

* Have informed wife's parents (since mine aren't JW's) that we will no longer attend meetings, service, conventions, etc. due to issues and problems we have with the Governing Body, how the organization is being run, and with various teachings that don't coincide with what the scriptures state (though they do not know that I'm firmly on the atheist side of things, and that my wife is more or less agnostic in viewpoint nowadays.)

* We have both spoken up against the organization and the Governing Body about how it has handled various things, such as DF'ing, the child abuse scandals, the methods they are controlling the congregations, etc.

* We do not openly celebrate holidays if they are around to see it, but they know that we will celebrate them when we go to visit my family.

* We openly associate with a long time friend of my wife's who has been DF'd for about two decades now. We've made it clear that we will not shun people.

Honestly, about the only things we aren't really open about is the complete depth of our disgust and disbelief in the organization. However, neither do we shy away from letting it be known that we have issues with the system. Also, we aren't completely open about participating in holiday stuff, though we have been open about the kids getting gifts around Christmas and other holidays.

We haven't actively DA'd yet, but it's pretty clear we no longer stand in the organization. The only reason we haven't DA'd completely is largely due to my wife's family and keeping that relationship open. Neither have we been DF'd yet, though we certainly could be for some of the things we've said to others and how we associate with a DF'd friend.

Will we DA some day? Who knows? I certainly don't give much of a shit about how the organization or anyone else wants to classify me. I get the right to choose for myself whether or not I feel like I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and I deny the right of anyone else to classify me against my will.

&gt; You still are a name and a number in the congregation list.

Who fucking cares whether I am or not? What business is it of anyone other than myself and my immediate family's? The Society can inflate or deflate their lists and membership numbers as they feel like, as there is no transparency behind their accounting anyway. Is anyone truly stupid enough to believe that if they have massive dropoffs in membership that they are actually going to publish that fact? All that matters to me is that I do not feel I am a member of the organization, I do not take an active part of it, and that I have made it known to those I care about that I will have nothing to do with the organization any further.

A ""stuck-in"" cannot do most of the stuff I outlined above. He may avoid meetings for the most part, but he certainly cannot state that he has problems with the Society and no longer wishes to support it through his monetary donations, his field ministry time, or his attendance at the meetings. In fact, a ""stuck-in"" may feel that he is forced, for one reason or another, to be an *active* part of the congregation, due to family, living circumstances, or other situation we are not privy to. In my opinion, **that** is the difference between a fader and a stuck-in. One has a certain amount of freedom, and a certain lack of expectation on the part of JW family, than the other. Stuck-ins have to continue to contribute in some way to the organization; faders do not.

The only difference between a fader and a person who has cleanly DA'd himself is that one left more quietly than the other, and likely because they are trying to maintain an open relationship with family who are still in the cult (because outside of family, why the fuck would you still be associated with the organization?) As for differences between faders and ""stuck-ins,"" one feels they have to make contributions to the Society for some reason whereas the other one doesn't. Still, this is generalizing everyone; there are varying degrees of openness with everyone, from DA'd to fader to stuck-in.

&gt; you give the cult what it wants from those who wake up to their abuse - silence.

And for the faders who've let it be known that they have problems with the organization? Is that also silence, simply because they chose to maintain some facade which allows them to continue communication with loved family members and with the hope that they can some day, hopefully, work those family members around to thinking for themselves? Are they likewise giving the cult what it wants?

Fuck that shit. I'm going melodramatic here: faders are the silent killers in the night; DA'd persons are the brash attackers in your face. Either one can get the job done, though they are effective against different targets for different reasons, and most warfare makes use of both. Stuck-ins are the refugees that do what they can, when they can, where they can; Viva la Resistance, no matter what form it takes.",2015-08-24 16:29:21+00:00,cue0wyb,1.0,t3_3i6a4y,34064.0,exjw

Those are the best punches. They leave their mark, but the recipient doesn't necessarily realize it.

It bothered me, and I didn't realize why at the time (oh, cognitive dissonance, how cultists love thee!)

That particular punch wasn't what knocked me askew and made me question the organization, and it certainly wasn't what shattered my own world view and led me to doubting and then waking up to reality, but it (and a whole bunch of other stuff) certainly contributed.

The path to waking up doesn't normally start with one event, but a series of them. There is, in my opinion, no ""making"" a person see reality, only contributory efforts. Your comments and questions are a part of that series. Maybe, when something does happen to jar your friend, they will help him wake up. Maybe they will be that little itch in the back of his mind, bothering him, that he has to occasionally pick at.",2015-08-19 20:45:13+00:00,cu8pdhi,7.0,t1_cu8o7fi,1637.0,exjw
1864,"&gt; ""violent videogames make you violent in real life""

I've always hated that reasoning. There is no correlation between playing a video game and then becoming a violent person. Hell, murder rates have actually decreased since the advent of shooting games (though that's not necessarily indicative of causality, mind you.) Millions of people play violent video games every day, and yet the vast majority of them seem to somehow manage to not go on killing sprees in their local grocery store when the apples that were on sale ring up at the wrong price.

If video games lead to violence, then so do other things which engage the same areas of our brains, such as movies, television, and books containing violence.

Oh, wait... the bible is a book, isn't it? And it reads like violence fetish porn throughout most of the Old Testament / Hebrew Scriptures...

Meh. Anyway... while living at their home, you have to live according to their rules, just as my kids have to live by my rules (no matter how unreasonable it may seem at times.) It really sucks for now. However, in another year you'll be 18 and hopefully going off to university... and GTA5 will be just as fun to play then as it is now. Maybe even more so, given you won't have to hide it. Trevor will give you some much needed venting when you have to deal with the aftereffects of completing finals.

Video games, violent or not, are harmless unless you're mentally unbalanced to begin with. You know what's really harmful to your brain? Watchtowers. Those things will rot your thinking ability. Just say no. Friends don't let friends read Watchtower magazines.",2015-08-19 20:28:32+00:00,cu8onxr,3.0,t1_cu8o0e5,899.0,exjw

1867,"&gt; I think that in almost all cases, refusing to discuss your own beliefs gives you tremendous power, infinitely more than trying to explain (bleecchh!) things, which almost always backfires.

I agree. Discussing our own beliefs will lead most JW's to simply block us off and throw up their defensive mental walls. If a person really wants to engage, you can't go far wrong with questions and critical statements (but not attacks!) about the organization. The idea is to get the person to begin thinking; an out-and-out declaration of your beliefs or lack of faith in the organization triggers the *Danger! Apostate!* loop in their conditioning.

When /u/truthcanbequestioned began to really question things, I encouraged her questions. I made little observations on things I had noticed here and there; little critiquing statements about stuff we had both been exposed to in the organization. Then, as the cracks in her armor got wider, I got more vocal and up front with things. But in the beginning I was so cautious... much like Matthew 10:16 - *“Look! I am sending you out as sheep among wolves; so prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves.* - NWT.

It's much the same method the JW's teach for getting people to question their entrenched beliefs to prepare them for indoctrination, especially for people married to a non-believing spouse. However, in this case, it's to get them to think for themselves rather than to indoctrinate them to a differing belief system.",2015-08-19 19:51:00+00:00,cu8n1g9,5.0,t1_cu8m8wd,1103.0,exjw

1870,"&gt; I very rarely contemplate attending church. If I have children, I'll need to do something to teach them about God,

Why? I assume you still believe in the Judeo-Christian God, but why do you need to do anything to teach your children about him? You seem to have a somewhat nebulous spirituality and belief in a creator; why isn't that good enough? I think your next point is illuminating:

&gt; I haven't seen a church that fits what I think it should be.

So why go to a church? If they don't offer what you need, or you see the hypocrisies that all churches seem to suffer from, or they just don't seem to really keep in tune with your own spiritual outlook, then why subject yourself or your children to that?

&gt; Don't let this bad experience keep you from loving God and being thankful for the gifts that he gives you everyday.

I have absolutely no intention of hostility or of being offensive when I say this: to each his own. Many of us are leading quite fulfilling lives without a belief in a supreme being, but if that's something you need in your life, then that's cool. I'm just glad you got out of the poisonous atmosphere of the Watchtower Society relatively intact, and that you were able to improve yourself since then. It's great that your parents are okay with you, even if it sounds like your relationship might be somewhat strained.

&gt; Use your own mind and decide what you believe...All you can do in life is what you think is right.

There is no tolerance in the Society of anything outside of the traditional heterosexual binary gender system. If you were born male, you're male, and vice versa. You might feel yourself to be free of gender identity, but the congregation never would. If you were trans, then you would be expected to live according to your birth gender; failing that, you would face ostracism in the congregation. You would certainly have no roles in the congregation; you would not qualify for any positions other than the basic rank and file. This applies to cross dressing as well as being openly trans.

If you are gay, then you are expected to hide it and live life as though you are not. You might be single for the rest of your life, you may be attracted to the same sex, etc., but you would not be allowed to be yourself in any way. Actions to the contrary would result in ""counseling,"" ostracism, and eventual removal (should you act on your sexual identity.) Again, you would very likely have no roles if it were known you were homosexual. Additionally, whether you were trans, gay, some combination of both, or some other gender identity not in line with the traditional binary/heterosexual system, you would be made to understand that you are very much imperfect and sinful (moreso than the typical person) through a variety of never ending slights, statements, etc. It's possible (but highly unlikely) that a gay JW could attain privileges, but only at the cost of denying himself, living in anguish over his/her attractions, and constantly suppressing who they were.

If you were NOT living according to your gender or sexual identity, and were maintaining the traditional binary/hetero roles, and it was unknown what your actual status was, then you'd be fine. You might be viewed as an oddity of a person or weird in some way, but you could likely (depending on **how** odd you were viewed) attain some of the privileges other brothers gained (unless you were female... then you're stuck with pioneering because you were born with the wrong genitalia.)

Basically, if you don't fit in with the traditional binary/heterosexual image, you're out in the cold and will be made to feel that way until you either conform or leave.",2015-08-19 14:59:41+00:00,cu8arnj,1.0,t3_3hkl8l,13091.0,exjw

1919,"&gt; I can't stand balsamic vinegar

Yeah, it was an... *interesting*... flavor. I'm glad I tried it, it was an experience. I'll not drink it again if it's offered.

Cider doesn't quite fit into the beer category comfortably. It's similar to beer in that it's fermented with yeast, has a similar alcohol content, and is bubbly (carbonation.) Yet, it's also similar to wine in that it's made from fruit. I think of it as a crossover type of drink: it's got a foot in both camps, but is it's own entity.

Smuel Smith's Organic Cider is supposed to be really good, but I haven't tried it yet. Angry Orchard is pretty decent; it might be made by the same guys who make Sam Adams beer, but it doesn't taste like beer.

&gt; Usually I just slice him up with analysis, reflecting his behavior back onto him, with a dash of sarcasm.

You indicated he was alcoholic in the past? It sounds like he's trying to avoid temptation; however, he needs to also respect that his inability to control his consumption shouldn't be applied to you. Not everyone who enjoys an alcoholic beverage will become an alcoholic, and you certainly don't announce that they will to an entire restaurant full of people. You are demonstrating that you respect his struggle by refraining from alcohol on most occasions, but for those times when you do want a drink, you should be allowed to enjoy it in peace. Hopefully he comes to this realization and leaves you alone; it certainly doesn't sound like alcoholism is a problem for you, given what you've stated.",2015-08-11 18:26:13+00:00,ctzf82f,12.0,t1_ctzeatc,1307.0,exjw

I love hard ciders. Think apple juice, with a little burn. They are one of my preferred drinks. Citrus shandies (think lemony beer) are another favorite... they shouldn't taste like the lime beer you got; good ones should taste decidedly lemony. I had one of **[these](http://www.gianteagle.com/ProductImages/PRODUCT_NODE_60/34100728052.jpg)** last night, and it didn't taste beery at all to me.

Beer isn't for everyone. I didn't like it for a long time, until I got a bit older and began exploring other nontraditional beers and after my tastes began changing. Most traditional domestic American beers are lousy; microbrews can be really good (though I had one about a year ago that tasted like balsamic vinegar... definitely weird, though I'm glad to have tried it for the experience. I won't likely drink it again.) The thing about beer is that you can find a huge variety (and more every year) with vastly different tastes to suit the drinker.

Whiskey has no carbohydrates (unless some flavoring has been added, which should be outlawed and punished with great malice) so if you like a keto-friendly diet it fits well. It has no fat, no cholesterol, and no sodium. Granted, it also has no potassium or vitamins, but it can't be a complete wonder-drink.

Hell, whiskey is one of the healthiest beverages you can imbibe, if you count healthy as meeting the criteria above.

In the other three congregations, any time you had a strong-willed or charismatic elder come in who wanted more ""responsibility"" (authority), there would generally be a dustup for a while, and either the old guard would assert themselves and make him know his role in the pecking order, or he would force changes and begin taking over roles that had been filled by others before him.

In my last congregation, the 8-man elder body was firmly controlled by 3 men who had been in their positions for decades and had quite a few strong ties to Bethel. It was very obvious who was in charge.",2015-08-04 20:21:21+00:00,ctri4v0,1.0,t3_3fsbic,1880.0,exjw

If you are planning on university or college, you will also want to ascertain the age at which you no longer have to account for your parent's income on your financial affidavits (well, at least this is the case in the US.) Here in the States, that's around 24, unless you've been emancipated as a teenager, which is an extremely difficult process to get through before your age of majority (18.) If you want or need financial aid, you need your parents financial information to put on your FAFSA and other financial aid documents. Yes, here in the States we'll gladly sign you into the military and send you out to die as soon as you're 18 based on your own desire to serve, but if you want money for an education you'll need your parent's permission and their financial information.

So, depending on if you are planning on secondary education, you can do it as soon as you've moved out and are supporting yourself, or after you've graduated college, with little fear of repercussions. This, of course, depends entirely on how petty or vindictive your parents would be; some people have no problems coming out before leaving home or before graduating college, while others have a nightmare of a time.",2015-08-03 02:57:12+00:00,ctpiiaa,2.0,t1_ctphalq,2364.0,exjw
1963,"&gt;  the entirety of the walk was basically dealing with her lecturing me and telling me to comeback and how leaving is affecting her happiness.

You know what's really awesome about cults like the Watchtower Society? How so many people feel so very entitled that they think it's alright to try to force someone else to be responsible for their happiness.

How is it your fault that this sister, who you don't know very well (and it must be assumed doesn't really know you that well either), is not happy all because you are leaving the organization? Don't the scriptures that Jehovah's Witnesses state that we are supposed to carry our own loads, to be responsible for ourselves before God (Gal. 6:5)? This has been brought out in the Watchtower as well. Is this sister not familiar with her own beliefs enough to realize that you cannot determine her happiness? This idea that you are somehow responsible for this person's happiness, especially as you are not well acquainted, is completely idiotic.

It has always rankled me, even as a true believer as I once was, that I should somehow be carrying my own burdens, my family burdens, and then be responsible for some numbnuts in the congregation whose apparent spirituality and happiness hinges upon my every move, because they cannot be responsible for themselves. Now that I'm a nonbeliever of any sort, it seems especially disgusting to me.

1982,"&gt; But sometimes I think exjw's that are ""doing better"" is only a myth. Or a ruse to help us cope with the fuckery of it all.

How do you mean, a myth? Do you think that exjw's can somehow magically be completely free of scarring? Perhaps that's true in some cases. Most of us have some scars, and some of us have lots, and we will likely carry that for the rest of our lives.

However, scars can be dealt with. They might be a part of us, but that doesn't mean we can't be functional, and that we can't get better over time.

Some of us have gone through some pretty extreme shit in our lives. Abuse, neglect, rape, the cult, more abuse, broken relationships, shunning, and all that... and yet, we can truthfully say we are getting better. You know why?

Because we aren't tied down to that fucking cult anymore, that's why. We are healing. We are getting better. We'll slip back on occasion; we'll slip into the mud and then pick ourselves up, clean ourselves up as best we can, and then start walking forward once again. We'll go through depression. Go through it, get out the other side, and keep on going. You aren't alone in this. You aren't the only one suffering, and the rest of us will help carry the load as best we can when you get down. But you have to be the one who ultimately has the strength to get your ass up and out of it, because all we can do is support. You are stronger than that fucking cult. You are better than that bitch of an exwife. Love for Jehovah has nothing to do with whether you are a good father or not, and your daughter will come to realize this as time goes on. My daughter used to give my wife and me fits because of the shit my exwife pulled on us and the manipulation she put my kid through. You know what? My daughter has been telling her friends and their parents that her biological mother is insane. *Without me fueling that thought.* I let her grow up and see things as they really were. It took 12 long fucking years, but she saw it for herself.

Life gets better. But only with time, hard work, and determination. There are going to be pitfalls. There are going to be relapses into depression. There are going to be bouts of anger.

Hell, for the past two weeks I've thought about how much easier things would be if I committed suicide; how much better things would be for my family, and how I wouldn't be able to disappoint them anymore. I do this every 4 - 6 months. In fact, yesterday was the first time in half a month where I felt semi-normal; today I'm doing quite a bit better. I know today that the suicidal thoughts were lies to myself. Hell, I knew that then as well, but they were so damned tempting... but suicide only transfers the pain from me to my wife and kids. Sure, I get out of it, but they get to live with it for the rest of their lives. Is that what you want to give your daughter? You don't hold on for your daughter, you hold on because you don't want your daughter to have the burden her daddy threw on her when he chose to stop holding on.

It gets better the longer you are away. When I woke up to TTATT, I was suicidal for a long period of time. Hell, the first six months had me thinking suicidal thoughts more than not thinking them; the next six months were about half and half. I still get them... hell, I'll most likely go through periods like that for the rest of my life, given what I grew up with. You know what? Every time I get through those dark times, I'm glad I didn't do it. I get another day when I can hear 4 of 4 laughing over some silly cartoon bug farting. I get to watch 1 of 4 get ready to go out on a date. I get to see 2 of 4 have a great time at a friend's birthday party. I get to see 3 of 4's face animate excitedly when he talks about which character he wants to dress up as for Halloween this year. I wouldn't get any of that if I ate the bullet I thought about eating a week ago.

Today is better than yesterday. Yesterday was a hell of a lot better than the two weeks before. The time before those two weeks were better than what came after. You take each day as it comes, you get through it as best you can, and if you look at things objectively you realize you had more good times than bad when all is said and done.

&gt; I've got a daughter. She's why I'm still here. But she can only keep me holding on for so long, especially since now she's being taught that Daddy doesn't love Jehovah.

This is called parental alienation. [There are things you can do about this.](http://family-law.lawyers.com/visitation-rights/parental-alienation-syndrome.html?page=2) Get your attorney involved. He can help stop this behavior.

&gt; How to Deal with Alienation
&gt; 
&gt; Are you a victim of the parental alienation syndrome? It can strike with little warning and leave you wracking your brain, trying to figure out what happened. Many alienated parents find it difficult to control their anger and hurt over being treated so poorly by their child and ex-spouse.
&gt; 
&gt; Experts on alienation suggest the following ways to cope with the problem:
&gt; 
&gt; * Try to control your anger. Stay calm and in control of your own behavior
&gt; * Keep a log of events as they happen, describing in detail what happened and when
&gt; * Always call or pick up your child as scheduled, even when you know the child won’t be available. This can be painful, but you must be able to document to the court that you tried to see your child and were refused
&gt; * During time spent with your child, focus on positive activities. Reminisce with your child about the good times you had together
&gt; * Never discuss the court case with your child
&gt; * Try not to argue with or be defensive with your child. Talk openly about what your child is actually seeing and feeling, as opposed to what the child has been told to be the truth
&gt; * Work on improving your parenting skills by taking parenting courses, reading parenting books, etc., so that you can be the best possible parent to your child
&gt; * If possible, get counseling for your child, preferably with a therapist trained to recognize and treat parental alienation syndrome. If it’s not possible to get your child into counseling, go to counseling yourself to learn how to react to and counteract the problem
&gt; * Don’t do anything to violate any court orders or otherwise be an undesirable parent. Pay your child support on time. Fulfill all your parenting obligations to the letter
&gt; * Don’t react to the alienating behavior by engaging in alienating behavior toward your ex. This just makes things worse and further harms your child
&gt; * If you’re not getting court-ordered time with your child, go back to court and ask that the parent violating the court order be held in contempt of court. The sooner you contact the court about the violation of the court order, the more likely it is that the problem can be stopped before it becomes permanent and irreversible. If your custody order isn’t specific as to exact times and dates you’re to be with the child, ask the court to make the order very specific so that there’s no doubt about what is required
&gt; * Try to support and not blame your child. Your child didn’t create the situation and desperately needs your love and affection

1983,"&gt; The local police are treating the vandalism as a hate crime. Officer Ken Bethune, who responded to the call today, said his department was familiar with McDaniel’s history with the Witnesses.

&gt; “She believes that this is just more backlash going back years, when she brought to light some molestation,” he said. “I labeled it as a hate crime because she said someone supports the view, in that particular congregation, against homosexuality.”

Interesting that the officer is taking it on as a hate crime. I agree with him, and it's likely that much of the hate stems from her being lesbian as well as testifying against one of their elders.

&gt; Since she was expelled three years ago, she said, she has been shunned by her family and harassed by the Witnesses in the form of anonymous threats and hate letters.

Just the harassment and hate mail puts it in the category of hate crime, especially if the perpetrators are spouting off about her sexuality. If the law can determine who is behind it and gather proof of their actions, then someone is going to have a very sore ass when the courts get done reaming them.

2003,"Yes, there was a land bridge between Australia and Asia, and yes, aboriginal peoples crossed it (and thus, it's possible that kangaroos could have crossed too.). However, the likely landfalls they would have made have been under water for the past 15,000 years, and the crossing of the aboriginal tribes are widely accepted to have been at a minimum of 40,000 years ago according to that article. Both land bridge and migration would have had to take place far earlier (about 3x earlier at minimum) than creationists say the Earth was formed.

Edit 1: Australia had a land bridge connecting it to New Guinea, and Borneo had a land bridge connecting it to Asia, but apparently the trench between Borneo and New Guinea was too deep for at least the past 50 million years to allow direct access from Australia to Asia. This would make it even more improbable that kangaroos or their ancestral equivalents could have arrived in Australia after a global flood a mere 4,500 - 5,000 years ago. Regardless, both human and kangaroo would have faced the daunting task of crossing the trench between between Borneo and ~~in~~ New Guinea. Humans could overcome that distance with technology; while ~~well~~ it's *possible* that ~~straight~~ kangaroos on driftwood ~~Driftwood~~ might have crossed the same trench, it is highly unlikely as ~~he has~~ you do not have kangaroos, or their fossils, on the Asian side of Indonesia. In fact, the fauna found between the Asian and ~~in~~ the Australian sides of the Indonesian island chains ~~James~~ has a sharp demarcation between Borneo and ~~in~~ New Guinea, where the oceanic trench separates the two islands.

Suicide is a permanent solution to a problem that can be overcome. There is a lot in life that you will find joy in, as long as you make it through your down times. You *can* make it through those down times, no matter how bleak it seems.

I, like several others who've commented in this thread, was not a born-in. I converted and got baptized around 18. My background was that I came from a socially repressive rural area of South Florida, I had been abused or neglected for much of my life, had been raped and molested as a younger child. I was really fucked up emotionally when some JW friends I had in high school invited me to the meetings. I will say that I was searching for something at the time: normalcy, love, and acceptance. That desire is what attracted me to the organization and kept me there for twenty years. Prior to conversion I was more or less agnostic, after conversion I was a believer (with a lot of suppressed doubts.)

However, I did leave.

I'm an LGBTQ ally. I am thoroughly liberal in political outlook (I test out somewhere to the left of Bill Clinton, but a bit to the right of Barack Obama.) I am scientifically literate, and constantly questing to learn more in order to expand my knowledge... I love learning. I don't believe in grand conspiracies. I have voted since leaving the organization, and am currently learning what I can about the candidates to make informed choices in the upcoming election. Within 6 months of stopping my meeting attendance I donated blood, and have donated a total of three times in the past two years.

You are right: people are often attracted to the Watchtower. But that's only because the Watchtower is actively seeking them and luring them in when they are looking for **something**... though what they are looking for isn't necessarily the WTBTS. Many of those who convert and leave do keep some of the crap from the organization with them... and many drop it like it's nuclear waste. Same thing for born-ins... many who come here looking for advice, help, etc. but were born-in have a very difficult time letting go what they've been indoctrinated into believing whereas others are able to give it up quite readily. Don't believe it? Just check out some of the ""I can't celebrate the holidays/see the point in voting/etc."" threads or comments that pop up periodically. Most of them are from born-ins.

Edit: There are a lot of hurdles for the average person to overcome to be heard, and you are right that the system seems (and is) broken and dysfunctional; unless you're a massive corporation you are rather unimportant to the vast majority of politicians. Still, outside of open, armed revolution you can only effect change through that broken system. And sometimes you can be a part of that change. For example, in the last election here in Florida, I voted for environmental protection in the matter of setting aside a fixed fund for wetlands restoration and maintenance; it's very important to protect these in a state like Florida where commercial development runs rampant and roughshod over everything, and with a state government quite willing to allow it. Our governor has overturned almost thirty years worth of hard-fought environmental protection here in Florida in his quest to create jobs by allowing corporations to do whatever the hell they feel like. The measure passed, and there is now a constitutional amendment requiring a certain amount of funding be set aside for wetlands; my state government, who would rather divert that funding to their own pork projects (and thus their bank accounts through various intermediaries and cutouts) now has to pay that money into something it was supposed to be going to in the first place. The broken part, the diverting of needed funding for ecological protection, got fixed (well, until those same asshats figure out a new way to siphon the money back into their cronies pockets. That's a battle for a future date.)

Take one ""wrong original understanding"" for an example: the topic of organ transplants. I'm stealing Mr. Grundy's work here:

&gt; Imagine being the Witness parent of a child that needed a kidney transplant in 1970. Although the Awake! 1949 Dec 22 had described transplants as ""wonders of modern surgery"", in 1967 God revealed that transplants were wrong in his eyes. The Watchtower 1967 Nov 15 pp.702-704 stated that being now ""enlightened by God's word"" God's people understood that transplants are against divine principles and cannibalistic. The parents must sincerely have believed they were putting Jehovah first when watching their child die, refusing them the opportunity of possible survival through a transplant. How would that parent feel on reading the Watchtower 1980 Mar 15 p.31 - ""There is no Biblical command pointedly forbidding the taking in of other human tissue. It is a matter for personal decision. "" The enlightenment of 1967 had proved to be dark, harmful and in need of later correction, a regressive doctrine that resulted in the unnecessary death of members. When a doctrine changes and then reverts back to the original position this is not evidence of light getting brighter, it is evidence of a lack of Holy Spirit directing the Governing Body.

Here we see a complete reversal of doctrine, and then another reversal yet again.

* 1949 - organ transplants are wonderful

* 1967 - God reveals somehow that transplants are wrong and actually cannibalistic, and therefore NOT to be done

* 1980 - God flips on his decision about transplants once again and says it's a ""matter for personal decision.""

For 13 years, God had supposedly informed his people that the original understanding, the **wrong original understanding**, was that a transplant was okay. If you needed one during that time period, and you were a faithful Witness, you died. Unnecessarily, as it turned out, because then God changed his mind again and went ""oh, you can go ahead and get your organs from other people. I was totally joking about them being cannibalistic.""

Charles Taze Russel, the founder of Jehovah's Witnesses, once stated (emphasis mine):

&gt; ""If we were following a man undoubtedly it would be different with us; undoubtedly one human idea would contradict another and that which was light one or two or six years ago would be regarded as darkness now;… But with God there is no variableness, neither shadow of turning, and so it is with truth; any knowledge or light coming from God must be like its author. **A new view of truth never can contradict a former truth.** ""New Light"" never extinguishes older ""light"" but adds to it…"" Zion's Watch Tower 1881 Feb pp.3,188

However, this happens frequently with the Watchtower's teachings. If Russel were alive today, and proposed many of the teachings that he taught as ""truth"" back then, and didn't accept the new versions and doctrinal changes made since his death, he would be disfellowshipped as an apostate and thrown out of the congregation.

A couple of other doctrinal changes that have occurred:

* [Prior to 1954, Jesus was an object of worship.](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/worship-jesus.php) After 1954, worshipping Jesus became idolatry and you could be disfellowshipped for it. Most modern Jehovah's Witnesses don't realize this, as most older Watchtowers have been either destroyed or are archived, and the Society will not grant access to them.

* [The understanding of ""superior authorities"" in Romans 13:1](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/superior-authorities.php) have been a cornerstone of various doctrines, and have changed throughout the years, and then changed back again.

There are many other changed doctrines and teachings; far more than is possible to go into here. [I recommend this article,](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/changed-watchtower-teachings.php) from JWFacts for some of the biggest changes. Here's a list of some of the things that have changed throughout the years, at a glance:

* [Changed date doctrine in the 1800's](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/1800s.php)

* [Changed the importance of the date 1914 in their doctrinal teachings](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/failed-1914-predictions.php)

* [1925 - announcement made that ""Millions now living **will** never die,](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/1925.php) when it failed, required the rewriting of the majority of the Watchtower's date doctrines.

* [Watchtower said that the anointed 144,000 class](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/memorial-partakers.php) (those that go to heaven according to them) closed in 1935. They've had to revise that statement, since the ""anointed"" have been increasing in numbers...

* Did you know the world was supposed to undergo Armageddon in 1975? The Society heavily implied this in their literature. Ask a JW about this date, however, and they will likely deny it. The Society itself says that the implication was on the part of some over-zealous brothers, and was not officially endorsed at all. [Except this list of Watchtower quotes refutes that claim.](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/1975.php)",2015-07-17 21:16:56+00:00,ct70unm,2.0,t1_ct6w17u,7538.0,casualiama
2110,"&gt;*Maybe if you based your research on something other than exjw and other butthurt disfellowshipped people, you'd know better than to believe the things you read on the internet*

Well, that's a hell of an assumption you've made there, buddy. I might also mention that your statement to me that I should ""know better than to believe the things you read on the internet"", *after you have already directed people to research your religion on your religious organization's very own internet site* is rather ironic. You imply that I need to research Jehovah's Witnesses on something other than exjw's. Cool, I can agree with that. No one here, to the best of my knowledge at this moment, has suggested that people not go to your sources to examine the JW side of the argument. **You** have stated that people should disregard information other than the official website of Jehovah's Witnesses by stating a statistic which you cannot back up and making a claim that the stories and information found in this thread are biased. **You** are the one insinuating that the people answering questions in here are falsely representing themselves. Most exJW's will tell interested people: look at information from both sides of the argument.

You mentioned that the Society encourages using multiple sources for research. Excellent, I'm glad that they have apparently changed the stance they've held for most of their history within the last three years since I left the flock. I'm also glad that you acknowledge the rightness of using multiple sources. I personally have used multiple sources to check my beliefs, at least I did once I began to wake up. Prior to that I toed the company line and used only their tools; I submit that using other sources is eye opening, to say the least.

However, I notice that you state (and I quote you below) that you are willing to use other sources, but in reality you seem to contradict yourself.

&gt; *Please no exjw messages. I didn't read this one, and I won't read any others. Thanks!*

How to make sense of this? Well, in case you actually are open minded enough to consider other resources, I would recommend some of the following websites:

http://www.jwfacts.com/ - You'll find lots of good information here, compiled by a former elder in the congregation. Plus, it has ample quotes from the Society's own literature! Don't just take Mr. Grundy's words for granted, check out his citations and quotes in your very own copy of the Watchtower magazines and books! I recommend checking them on the old Watchtower Library CD; it was much easier to find the information on than picking up the bound volumes.

http://jwsurvey.org/ - This is more of a blog site, but it also has reams of good info on it. It's not as encyclopedic as JWFacts, but is often more entertaining given it's writing style. Also written by a former elder in the congregation.

https://www.jehovahswitnessrecovery.com/ - You might not like this one. After all, it's ""butthurt exjw"" stuff. However, given your cavalier attitudes about the damage that disfellowshipping causes, you could use the education of the personal experiences within it.

http://www.silentlambs.org/ - specifically deals with the multitude of child abuse cases around the world linked to the Watchtower Society and Jehovah's Witnesses. These are more of those ""butthurt exjw's"" you denigrated earlier. I include it, however, because you should be aware of your own organization's dirty laundry.

Now, I will be totally open and honest: as you have probably gathered, the above are websites run by exJW's. You might, because of your deep indoctrination from the Society, be reticent to go to those. That's a shame, as the best information that presents the other side of the JW coin is from exJW's; we're one of the few people who actually give a damn about you and the other Witnesses in this world.

**The good news is that you can explore many facets of Jehovah's Witnesses from the perspective of other people than exJW's!** I'd recommend the following site that **is not** exJW in origin:

https://www.freedomofmind.com/Info/infoDet.php?id=114 - a database run by the [Freedom of Mind Resource Center](https://www.freedomofmind.com/), a group created by Steve Hassan, a noted mental health counselor and one of America's leading cult experts. This particular link goes directly to their section on Jehovah's Witnesses and has articles, videos, and other information.

You should also familiarize yourself with the following:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Reform_and_the_Psychology_of_Totalism#Main_points - I recommend reading the section on ""Main Points"" under the topic *Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism*.

2113,"There really isn't any more to it than that. I'm offering a generalization here; individuals may vary, but the normal reactions by the majority of JW's are the same: if you offer them religious material or literature they will either turn it down or, if they do accept it, will dispose of it as soon as possible after they are away from you. Individuals might vary to some degree, as humanity isn't nearly as homogenized as one might think, but the vast majority of Witnesses are far more homogenous in their outlook and behaviors than most people are. It's all a result of indoctrination, you see.

Understand: the Watchtower Society has trained and indoctrinated them to believe that they are the one true religion, and every other religious group is controlled by Satan and therefore is false religion. That's how the Society describes your religious beliefs in their literature: *false religion*. The members of those religions are unwitting tools and followers of Satan, but they are still part of a wicked and evil system. Their job is to save you from that condition... you have nothing to offer them in return in their minds. Any literature or religious material you would give them is designed by Satan to weaken their faith... plus, since you don't have truth but they do, why would they bother to read it?

Now, perhaps and individual might read it out of curiosity... but he would be, in their own words, spiritually weak and courting spiritual disaster. Were he to read that material and then think ""Hmm, they make good points, maybe I should explore this further"" and then goes to your religious services, even for one exploratory meeting, then he has committed the sin of false worship. If he rejects what he has done and seeks the ""loving counsel"" of the elders - in other words, if he seeks mental readjustment - then it stops there, most likely. If he continues to read your literature and go to your services then he will be disfellowshipped for becoming an apostate. Given the fact that the JW in question stands to lose his entire social and familial network through shunning (disfellowshipping), he's not likely to risk it.

They are indeed hypocrites who expect others to listen to them and read their stuff, but they aren't willing to look into other people's religions. Except insofar as they are taught by the organization to induce doubts into the minds of the followers of those religions in order to make them more willing to listen to the messages that JW's preach.

2116,"My wife and I both became disillusioned and voluntarily left at around the same time a few years ago. It wasn't really one particular thing that led to us leaving, but a whole bunch of things building up over a period of time. We've never disassociated because her family is all in the organization, and disassociated people are to be treated just like disfellowshipped people: absolute and complete shunning. Her parents know we have severe issues with the organization and the direction it's going in, but they can live with that if they aren't forced to acknowledge that we are completely out and never coming back; it's a fiction that we put up with because otherwise they **will** shun us, or at least her father will. We're also not disfellowshipped, although were the elders made fully aware of how much we disagree with the Governing Body we soon would be.

I left in my late 30's. There were a lot of things that just didn't add up over the years; JW's are taught to hide and ignore their own feelings of doubt, but after a while that becomes a pretty large internal burden. Then there were a series of things that went very wrong in my family's life (nothing that we had control over at the time), and the ""help"" and ""counsel"" that the elders provided actually made things worse. There were, for my wife and I, several earth-shaking events that transpired one after another and rocked our world view enough that we began to see the realities behind the organization - really, we began to see the man behind the curtain, so to speak.

Additionally, my wife was a regular pioneer, and attending JW's pioneer school; the things she heard and learned there from the circuit overseers teaching the course made her reevaluate a lot of what she thought she knew of the organization. She heard things there that really disturbed her; things that the average rank and file member doesn't hear or learn. One thing in particular stood out: the circuit overseer (who is in a position right below that of the Governing Body, is supposed to be appointed to that position by the GB, and is supposed to be their mouthpiece to the congregations, essentially) related the story of a JW woman who married a man from Mexico. He convinces her to leave the US and go to his home country. Turns out he's abusive and severely beats her. She leaves him, crosses back over the border to her family's home in the States. The question was posed: what is the proper course of action for the elders in counselling her? Turns out that according to the organization, she is supposed to go back to her husband in Mexico and endure what happens, and that leaving him in that situation was wrong. Part of the justification for this is that she should have known what kind of man he was when she married him. Pioneer sisters, like my wife, are supposed to agree with that direction from the organization and back it up if they are faced with a similar situation or if they are asked for advice by another woman in that situation.

At the same time that she was going through that school, I had been appointed as a ministerial servant for quite some time (and was tracking towards elder.) I was used for various instructional parts in the Kingdom Hall. I was delivering public Sunday talks (think sermons and you have the right idea), parts on our Service Meetings as well as instructional parts on our Theocratic Ministry School (these are instructional meetings where the rank and file are taught how to be more effective in the field ministry, how to use scriptural arguments to indoctrinate others - of course, it's not put that way by the organization - and various other things that teach them how to be good little JW's.) There were a lot of behind-the-scene things that I was learning at the time that made me very uncomfortable. In particular were meetings held when the circuit overseers came to our congregations between the CO, the elders, and the ministerial servants where we would receive instructions on how to ""shepherd"" - oversee - the flock. Stories like the one my wife related to me in the paragraph above were normal; there were others that raised the hackles on the back of my neck.

When you hear female exJW's complain that they were expected to be subservient to the men of the organization and that they had few rights of their own, they aren't kidding. A lot of the instruction I received dealt with men keeping control of their families and the congregation. A lot of what I learned was how to handle reproving people, why and how judicial committee decisions were made, and (for some reason) a hell of a lot of information about why pornography was so horrible and wrong - the Society puts a lot of emphasis on controlling what people do with their genitals.",2015-07-17 13:10:52+00:00,ct6i3ao,16.0,t1_ct6bens,22854.0,casualiama

Hell, maybe even have him read your post here. Give him a rundown on how JW's tend to behave and think. Explain that your parents are members of a very high-control religion (if you don't like the word cult) and their thoughts are shaped by that.

Or, could you be panicking over nothing? Could your parents treat him respectfully and kindly in person, only talking about their concerns with you later on? If they have really accepted that you don't believe as they do and they understand your viewpoint, then perhaps it won't be as bad as you fear.

Regardless, your boyfriend should know that things might get a bit weird or awkward. That doesn't change how you feel about him, and honestly it wouldn't be the first time in-laws had a strained relationship with their child's chosen partner.

As an exJW, I'm glad that your family has a better view of love than most involved in the organization. They haven't allowed the overall attitude of conditional affection to infect them. They are an aberration, however.

It's not that JW's don't demonstrate love, understand... it's that it is **so** conditional on being one of them (for the majority of Witnesses) that is the problem. Most of us have lost family, lost friends, and have been vilified and emotionally abused by our ""loved ones."" That is an attitude encouraged by the Watchtower Society. We are vilified from the platform at meetings, in the literature, and from the Governing Body themselves as ""mentally diseased,"" ""Satanic,"" and ""wicked"" apostates. Those are negatively charged words designed to separate us from our loved ones.

[**Here are just a few**](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/quotes/apostates.php) of the organization's quotes about apostates. These quotes are taken from their literature. If you're squeamish about going to an ""apostate website,"" then check out their own literature for yourself. In fact, I recommend checking both sides of the argument (something you won't hear from a JW generally.) If you have an older copy of the Watchtower Library CD, you can look these up for yourself (I say older because the organization has been caught numerous times changing doctrine in old articles electronically and then claiming that they always taught those changes.)

Oh, and according to the Governing Body, you are an apostate regardless of being baptized or not. You knew the ""proper teachings"" and yet rejected them. Welcome to the club, fellow mentally-diseased minion of Satan!

&gt; “**Apostasy is abandoning or deserting the worship and service of God, actually a rebellion against Jehovah God.** Some apostates profess to know and serve God but reject teachings or requirements set out in his Word.

I was a ""worldly"" outsider until my mid- to late-teens when I was exposed to the cult; I studied from 16-18, and completed my conversion at 18 when I got baptized.

Cults often look for the emotionally vulnerable. People who have had life shattering events (grief, abuse, etc.) tend to think emotionally and lack their normal reasonableness. That's how I became enmeshed in the cult: a lifetime of abuse and neglect, coupled with the apparent destruction of my family (I had to run away to survive), a bad breakup with a girl I was in love with (you know how teenagers are...) and I was ripe for the pickings when some JW friends I had in high school invited me to their meetings. Even though I was reasonably intelligent and had, up until that point, a great belief in the needs of science and education to further humanity, I still managed to succumb to the lure of emotional stability and normalcy that the Witnesses seemed to offer. The indoctrination process is subtle; most JW's don't even realize they are indoctrinating you... but it's almost a science in emotional manipulation and blackmail. That they (and we exJW's) were trained by the Society to seek out people in emotional turmoil (part of the reason for the field ministry, actually) and ensnare them in turn... well, that's part of the program, and most JW's aren't even aware of how they are taught to do that.

I've always had a problem with crushing that voice of reason that loved science, though. Eventually, other life-shattering events occurred that rocked my worldview enough for me to be able to breathe, look around, and realize that I had made a huge mistake almost 20 years ago.

2172,"It's a far larger problem than the rank-and-file JW's know or want to believe. Most of the court cases brought against the organization have had one thing in common: the organization, through its elders, it's circuit overseers, and the upper management at Bethel (their headquarters) has hidden occurrences of child abuse and molestation. They have, through some rather Byzantine rules, created a society of silence and secrecy, especially when something occurs that might shed them in a bad light in the public eye. Child predators find the environment to be particularly fruitful for them, because of the secrecy things are held in. Child victims and their parents are often discouraged, through various means, from going to authorities with the crime. Sometimes they are even threatened with expulsion from the organization and disfellowshipping. If anything is done to the predator, it is kept under wraps, and the predator can work his way back into the organization's good graces and can even be appointed later on as a ministerial servant or elder (and put in charge of organizing things like the field ministry - door-to-door work - with children. It's happened, numerous times.)

This is an organization that views child predation as a **sin** rather than a crime. They equate it (strongly) with homosexuality and view it as an abhorrence, but it is outweighed by the need to keep the organization clean-looking to the rank-and-file and outsiders looking in. The needs of the child, and the protection of the same, takes a distant second place to that overriding concern of theirs.

Here's a few: [1st,](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beyond-bullying/201309/the-silence-shunning-conversation-kipling-william) [2nd,](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-time-cure/201302/shunning-the-ultimate-rejection) [3rd](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-time-cure/201303/shunning-the-ultimate-rejection-part-ii).

Some families will break the rules on shunning, but very few. The Society (the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses) constantly stresses the importance of shunning disfellowshipped people, equating it with a life-or-death loyalty test to God. It is repeatedly written about in their instructional books and magazines, it is spoken of on the platforms at their meetings, it is used as examples during their assemblies and conventions. It is also a disfellowshipping offense to associate with disfellowshipped persons if they are not close relatives living at home or spouses. Guilt and fear are the Watchtower Society's key weapons to keep the rank-and-file in line.

As for enforcing divorce if one partner wakes up... well, they state repeatedly that the only good reason for a divorce - *with the hope of a scriptural remarriage* - is due to adultery. However, if one partner claims that they feel their spiritual welfare is being endangered, then it can be done without too much problem.

As for waking up their partner... this has happened occasionally. However, it largely depends on the partner and how tied to the organization they are. In my case, my wife left shortly after I did; she saw a lot of the same things I did. In another person's case that I know of, they are still married to a believing spouse, and there isn't much hope of that person waking up.

I could have very easily been disfellowshipped for coming out to my wife about my lack of belief, had she felt a need to go to the elders to report me. In fact, it was actually a fear that I had, and that our marriage would fail shortly afterwards. I'm glad to say that this hasn't happened, and I think we are closer now for the display of trust than we were before.",2015-07-15 20:23:56+00:00,ct4jwij,2.0,t1_ct4idxo,2213.0,casualiama

For me, the worst part of being a Jehovah's Witness on a daily basis was the soul crushing process of having to deny who I was as a person, denial of my so-called ""worldly"" family, and having to subsume my real personality under the ""new personality"" that Witnesses are instructed to form as part of the group (also commonly known as mind control or brainwashing.) I had a huge amount of [cognitive dissonance](http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html) going on, as I had to take a lot of things I knew were factual (lots of scientific knowledge and teachings) and had to convince myself that those things were wrong in the face of Watchtower Society teachings.

2199,"First, let's define the term disfellowshipping (Watchtower refers to the JW's main form of instruction, the Watchtower magazine):

&gt; ""Thus ""disfellowshiping"" is what Jehovah's Witnesses appropriately call the expelling and subsequent shunning of such an unrepentant wrongdoer."" Watchtower 1981 Sep 15 p.22

There are a number of reasons a person can be disfellowshipped. Here's a few of them (note how many seem to be focused on what people do with their genitals):

1. Adultery

2. Fornication

3. Apostasy (hey, what we exJW's are doing right now!)

4. Homosexuality

5. Associating with disfellowshipped people (can't have a relationship with someone who's disfellowshipped unless they are a close family member or a spouse.)

6. Blood and blood transfusions (can't donate, can't receive.)

7. Drug use

8. Drunkenness

9. Dishonest business practices

10. Employment violating Christian principles (working for other religious organization, working in a gambling institution, selling tobacco, contract work at a military establishment, being a member of the military)

11. False worship (attending another church, following mourning customs that involve false worship)

12. Fraud

13. Gambling (or related employment)

14. Gluttony

15. Greediness (rather open ended, isn't it?)

16. Idolatry

17. Loose conduct (again, rather open ended, but includes things that the elders/Society feels is sexual perversion - things like oral sex, etc., things that show disregard for Jehovah's moral standards, and disrespect, disregard, or even contempt for what the Society states are God's standards, laws, and authority.)

18. Lying

19. Non-neutral activities (politics and military service)

20. Obscene speech

21. Parents who condone immorality with their children (report your kids to the elders, moms and dads!)

22. Porneia (includes oral and anal sex between married couples, mutual masturbation between persons not married to each other, homosexuality, lesbianism, fornication, adultery, incest, and bestiality - all of these things are considered comparable)

23. Slander

24. Spiritism (includes yoga)

25. Stealing, thievery

26. Subversive activity (such as hosting or participating in an AMA such as this!)

27. Uncleanness (Sexually perverse practices within marriage, such as oral and anal sex, heavy petting and breast fondling, touching of sexual parts, practice of viewing abhorrent pornography)

28. Violation of secular law if done in flagrant manner

29. Violence, extreme physical abuse, fits of anger

30. Willful nonsupport of family, endangerment of mate's spirituality

31. Participating in worldly celebrations such as Christmas and Easter.",2015-07-15 16:51:27+00:00,ct4b89a,2.0,t1_ct4agcv,1145.0,IAmA

Most recovery efforts aimed at getting people out of cults require separating them from the group for a period of time in order to weaken that grip the cult holds on them, so that they can breathe, take a look at themselves and the cult, and hopefully come to a realization that there are things that are just wrong about it. However, you start getting into legal trouble if you kidnap someone out of the cult... so it's not a good idea to snatch them up and isolate them to get them to see reason.

2224,"&gt; I feel like I've been blaming myself for not being smart enough to see it. Why couldn't I see? I am a smart person--people say I have an old soul. What blocked me from seeing?

Why would you blame yourself for not being smart enough to see it? You simply processed your experiences differently than your brothers. Your older brothers had different experiences and outlooks than you did, as did your younger brother.

Check this (not to sound like I'm bragging, because I'm not; generally I'm my own worst critic):

I was not born or raised a JW. I started studying at the age of 16 and converted (got baptized) at 18. Prior to that I was what most people would call a nerd; albeit one that was good at certain sports. Hell, I'm still a nerd (and hipster enough to say I was a nerd before it was cool.) I was in the gifted program at school (I had tested with a high IQ, for whatever that's worth), I had been a member of Mensa, I didn't have to apply myself very much in school to get excellent test scores, and most comprehensive tests I took I generally placed in the upper 1% - 3% of the nation (depending on the subject: math was my weak point.) Even today I find myself easily bored; with only a tech school education I haven't managed to get a job that truly challenges me intellectually (and the ones that would challenge me require far more schooling than I currently have - hope to rectify that in the next three years.)

And yet, I converted to a religion that is obviously a sham and a cult. Why? I can only chalk it up to low self-esteem and trauma from a lifetime of childhood abuse and neglect, plus the added weight of having been molested and raped as a child on a number of occasions, plus being a social outcast in my school, plus living in a remarkably socially backwards and repressed region of the country (JW's actually fit right in there with their social outlooks), plus various other issues. Basically, I was emotionally vulnerable at a time when I was perfect for recruitment, and was unlucky enough to be exposed to the Witnesses through what few friends I had at the time.

Smart people get involved in cults all the time. Hell, the best members to recruit are intelligent and yet relatively inexperienced people. I knew a number of JW's who had degrees; yet, they still got embroiled in the cult. No one believes they *joined* a cult; it isn't until they begin waking up that it dawns on them. You were raised in it; for you, it was pretty normal. What we are familiar with is normal for us as individuals; others might think it's weird as hell. You may have identified closely with your mother at some level at the time, or perhaps you felt a responsibility to get baptized even if, subconsciously, you didn't believe. Regardless, it doesn't make you less intelligent than your brothers that you got wrapped up in something they managed to avoid; it just means you processed things differently than they did, and took a little longer to realize what it actually meant to you.

Think of this: how many people do you see here in /r/exjw who are intelligent? I've met a number of very smart people through this subreddit. We all have one thing in common: no matter how it happened, we were all members of a cult at one point.",2015-07-08 15:40:55+00:00,csw9wox,3.0,t1_csw8ht1,2224.0,exjw

He had switched out for another brother during this one part, and was sitting next to this sweet little old lady (he said she looked to be in her 80's.) The speaker quoted 1Cor. 15:33 - ""Bad associations spoil useful habits.""

As you know, [""associate""](https://www.signingsavvy.com/sign/ASSOCIATE/2992/1) is a thumb's up, with a thumb down circling it (apparently he didn't use the sign for ""association,"" which is different.) Evidently, the brother in question used the sign for [""circumcise,""](http://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=6264) which is really similar...

From what the brother said, the sweet little 80-year old deaf lady was laughing so hard she had tears running down her face and almost fell out of her chair, while everyone else around him looked shocked and aghast. The brother was barely able to continue once he realized what he had signed.

Most of the ones I knew owned their own businesses and had quite a bit saved up in the bank, or continued to get paid from their interests in those businesses. Some of them started out as poor as the standard rank and file, but succeeded later on; it's what allowed them the opportunity to become CO's in the first place. An elder I once knew stated to me once: ""Have you ever seen a *poor* circuit overseer?""

They continue to make a living without having to pay for anything themselves, and on top of that they receive ""gifts"" from the congregations.

There is absolutely no transparency or real accounting for how they are supported; the congregations are given a number for the CO's ""needs"" and then encouraged to spend more than that. Bethel probably knows how much they are receiving (although, as someone else posted, I don't believe they need to report gifts,) but continues to shade them.

Edit - this is still the standard for blood transfusions and children as far as I know:

*""But suppose one's wife or child were near death.* **Giving blood, no matter who the loved one might be, would still constitute a violation of God's law.** *Just because one is near death, this does not give one liberty to break God's commands. When one is near death is no time to tamper with or violate the law of God, but a time to draw as near as possible to God by remaining faithful. Everlasting life is the reward for faithfulness.

There was a level of chance, perhaps, but that is no different than a golfer that has a gust of wind blow his ball off course a little bit. The CO agreed that he was probably correct that tournament poker players use skill and strategy far more than luck of the draw, but used the age old argument you mentioned above: ""Yeah, but how would other people perceive it?""

George Romero-type zombies would be better killed with quieter, more stealthy weapons. Their hearing is supposed to be very acute, so you want to silently kill them where possible to avoid swarming. For that, go Daryl-style and pick up a crossbow with a ton of bolts; bows require a bit more training to be effective whereas crossbows are a bit easier to aim due to their construction.

Make sure you have some sort of bladed or crushing melee weapon as backup. You don't **want** to get within arm's reach, but it's almost certain that at some point you will be, and you want something relatively quiet for that as well.

Don't fall for the hype of flamethrowers. In most situations they will be as dangerous to you as to the zombies.

2297,"This topic comes up a lot in here. Unfortunately, the answers rarely change.

&gt; 1) Stay at home until he turns 18 (next June unfortunately). This is not ideal. My parents will let him go to college, but not the college he wants to go to. Also they are trying to force him to aux pioneer.

This will likely be the easiest route, as well as the most realistic for your brother's situation, for a variety of reasons. The primary reason is that emancipation takes a degree of time to accomplish in court, and the qualifying ages for emancipation limits the amount of time available (in other words, he likely won't have enough time left in your parents' home to become emancipated before he hits 18. Another reason is that emancipation as a teen is understandably hard to qualify for due to the proof needed and the hoops you have to jump through. The courts don't want rebellious teens emancipating themselves just because they got pissy at their parents (I'm not saying this is the case here with your brother, just that this is how the courts view it.) Unless your parents throw your brother out and state they no longer want him around, it's not likely to happen.

I might add that law enforcement likely will not attempt to *force* your brother back home, given his age and how close he is to the age of majority.

&gt; 2) Get Emancipated. This requires either my parents saying they don't want him anymore, or proving that his parents are not fit to parent him. If anyone knows anything else about Emancipation in the state of Georgia, we could really use your help. I believe he will need to prove that he can support himself financially and my parents will not allow him to get a job.

Here is the pertinent information on [Georgia's emancipation laws:](http://www.georgialegalaid.org/resource/emancipation-of-minors?ref=7eJpu)

**Who can be emancipated by a Juvenile Court Order?**

*Minors who are at least 16 years old and less than 18 years old may apply for emancipation in Juvenile Court. The minor must be a Georgia resident.*

**How does a minor prove that the emancipation should be granted?**

*The minors must be able to show:*

*That the minor's parents or guardians do not object to emancipation. If they do object, then the minor must show that the emancipation is in his or her best interests.*

*That the minor has the ability to manage his or her own financial affairs. This includes having proof of employment or other means of support (not public assistance).*

*That the minor has the ability to manage his or her own personal and social affairs. This includes having proof of a place to live.That the minor understands his or her rights and responsibilities after emancipation.*

*The minor must list any adults who have personal knowledge of the minor's situation and who believe that emancipation is in the best interest of the minor. The court will contact these adults and seek a sworn statement from the adults describing why the adult believes the minor should be emancipated. Some examples of adults the minor might list are:*

*A doctor or nurse*

*A psychologist, counselor or therapist*

*A social worker or school guidance counselor*

*A school administrator, principal or teacher*

*A clergy member*

*A law enforcement officer*

*An attorney*

*Anyone involved in the emancipation case can ask the court to assign an employee or appoint a guardian ad litem to investigate and make a recommendation as to whether emancipation is in the best interest of the minor. The court can also appoint an attorney for the minor and appoint an attorney for the parents or guardian if they are indigent and oppose the petition.*
**Can a minor obtain Juvenile Court emancipation without informing his or her parents or guardians?**

*No. All living parents (or guardians) must be notified of the minor's request for emancipation. The minor must list each parent's (or guardian's) name and last known address. Sometimes the minor's parents (or guardians) are no longer living or cannot be found. In this case, the minor must list the name and address of the nearest living Georgia relative.*

&gt; 3) Guardianship. I could legally be his guardian, but this would require him to use my tax forms for FAFSA for when he goes to college. This would be fine, but I'd think we'd both prefer emancipation.

This is a potential route; I don't know exactly how this would work out. I think it would still require that your parents stop seeking to have your brother live with them.",2015-07-01 12:09:03+00:00,csolf39,1.0,t3_3bpo3o,30649.0,exjw

2301,"&gt; ... by no means am I saying that this problem is unique to Jehovah’s Witnesses. **I am actually pretty sure that it is worse in many other groups including the Catholic Church, where there is a literal hierarchy on paper.**

I don't know that I would agree that the problem is worse in the Catholic Church by any means. Jehovah's Witnesses have a clearly defined hierarchy as well, though the terms are different.

From the top-down:

* Governing Body

* Various Committees and departments run by elders at Bethel and its associated branches around the world

* District Overseers

* Circuit Overseers

* Various committees run by the elders within a circuit

* Congregation Elders

* Various committees run by congregation elders

* Ministerial Servants

* Rank &amp; File (the laity) - households controlled by the husband

The GB hands down the overall edicts, which is fleshed out and reinforced by the Bethel committees and departments; this is then passed down to the DO's and CO's, who delegate enforcement to the congregation elders, who enforce it on a congregation level with the assistance of Ministerial Servants. There are other committees to handle the running of the whole shebang (the RBC - or whatever it's called now, the convention committees, etc.)

This is a definite and concrete hierarchy, hence the Society stating in court (as the author brings out) that they are organized from the top - down much like the Catholic Church (or words to that effect.)

&gt; Class distinction is only human, I guess. But Jehovah’s Witnesses like to claim that they are immune to these kinds of social problems as a group. They write: “Jehovah’s Witnesses […] recognize that social classes have no meaning in the eyes of God. Thus, **they have no clergy/laity division, and they are not segregated according to skin color or wealth.**” In fact, the article where those words appear is even one of the top ten search results when you google “class distinction.”
&gt; 
&gt; **While the second part largely holds true, I have to disagree with the first proposition.**

I believe, unless I'm mistaken, that the author is confirming that there is a clergy/laity division. It's certainly in keeping with what a lot of us are familiar with, and with the overall message of the article. I think there is more of a problem with wealth segregation or discrimination than there is with race, though in certain parts of the world that can still raise its ugly head (and, at one time, racism was part and parcel to the Society's teachings... granted, it's been largely done away with, but it's still there to some extent.) By far a larger problem is wealth privilege. As one elder once said to me, ""Have you ever seen a **poor** circuit overseer? Maybe at one time in their lives, but certainly not when they were appointed as an overseer.""

I used to live in a congregation in which the vast majority (say, about 4/5) of the elders were wealthy men... it was hard for someone in lower middle class (and impossible for lower class) to hold a position. Granted, that's anecdotal, but it held true through several congregations I was a member of. I can only think of one congregation in which half the elder body could be counted as mid- to lower-middle class; they weren't part of any of the circuit-level committees as a result, I believe (partly because they were too busy busting ass trying to put food on the table to deal with more responsibilities than they had.)",2015-06-30 18:06:26+00:00,csns7qe,1.0,t3_3bmrno,14726.0,exjw

As any sales manager will tell you, the answer to everything is to sell, Sell, SELL!

Your mother died? Get on the phone and make cold calls to get sales appointments. Nothing helps grief like distraction, nothing distracts like the stress of cold calling.

Your daughter is pregnant? Get out there and get people's signatures on those contracts. You're going to need the commission and residuals.

Your dog chewed your testicles off? Cool. Now you have one less distraction from getting new clients.

Zombies are breaking out and laying waste to civilization? More bodies to sign the paperwork, more potential customers, you now have a target rich environment to practice your pitch to.

The Society is no different; everything they teach the rank and file is all about selling their product to the exclusion of everything else. If you want to show loyalty to the company, then you sell.

2308,"It's a classic case of an abusive relationship, with a ton of mental conditioning thrown in for good measure. The two go hand-in-hand.

Think of how many people find themselves tied to an abusive person (speaking from a number of past experiences here); you feel as though you deserve the treatment you receive for a variety of reasons, most of which are self-esteem issues. You keep returning to the person, hoping things will get better, even when it's obvious it won't; that, or you keep returning to the person knowing that you cannot do any better and that you should (for some reason) be treated badly.

Likewise a DF'd person: you've been told time and again that you deserve the bad treatment you are getting. You go overboard on guilting yourself. You know that you did something to deserve this; you know that there is no other hope out there for you. You go back to the organization like a battered spouse goes back to their personal hell. You keep going back to it, because you know you have no other options. Never mind that you really do have options, never mind that you are better than that, and never mind that there are people who will love you properly... you can't see it, because you are worthless without your abusive partner (the WTBTS in this case.)

It's why so many of us need the assistance of a support group in some way; and why so many of us need therapy (whether or not we get it is a different matter, as many of us cannot afford it.) Coming out of Da' Troof is like running from an abusive family member: you need shelter, you need support, you need an emotional platform.

Add to all that the completely normal fear of rejection (amplified by the WTBTS' teachings and mental conditioning) and the fear of the unknown... it's not surprising that so many DF'd people go back, even if it's not so that they can leave on their own terms.

If you can get your followers to willingly martyr themselves to your god, especially if there's an easy way out of it (relatively speaking), then you have something that can cement them to you more strongly. It also gives you something concrete that separates your followers from all the benighted and doomed people of the world that don't believe as you do.

As well as the opportunity to add an extra nuance to their control over their follower's minds and behavior through the Watchtower's stance on blood, I think part of the GB's reasoning is also as simple as ""We said this was the way it's supposed to be, and dammit, we're not going to be gainsaid, even in the face of evidence that we are incorrectly applying the scriptures."" In other words, they've decided blood is bad and they're going to hold to that no matter how wrong they are.",2015-06-26 01:27:04+00:00,csixq74,4.0,t1_csitvsp,6836.0,exjw

2332,"We aren't afraid to discuss these things, because we discuss them at length on a frequent basis. Death threats and physical violence are just far more uncommon than mental abuse and blackmail. You will see more discussion of the latter than the former just because the rate of incidence is so much higher for those things; more people have experienced the destruction of their family groups, have suffered emotional blackmail, and have survived mental and emotional abuse than they have outright physical violence or death threats.

That isn't to say that physical abuse and threats don't occur; we've had several people in my time here who have had some rather harrowing stories in that regard, and the community generally rallies around those people and offers what emotional support we can.

The same is true of other exJW sites and blogs. I've never known exJW's to shy away from discussing the abuses that we've all suffered, and some have suffered more of, and they certainly haven't avoided discussing it out of a sense of fear.

2362,"&gt; How did that affect you, especially after having left?

&gt; How do you feel about sexuality now since you left?

Immediately after leaving I had to question a lot of things about my own sexuality. As a married man with a family at age 38. Talk about confusing and depressing... when I realized and accepted for certain that the organization was wrong, it really threw my world into a loop; I had to reevaluate everything in my life and myself. Add in childhood traumas, various issues from growing up in an extremely rural and repressed area in addition to converting to being a Witness... well, I had never had the opportunity to really explore things that a lot of people take for granted in their late teens and early twenties.

Since, I think I've gotten a lot of things figured out. My wife and I really enjoy repression-free sex, and we like the kinkier things in life. Now we're in the process of getting into better shape so that we can explore some of those deep, dark fantasies in real life. We haven't really gone beyond the bounds of the typical marriage, but within it we feel far more free to explore our own interests and boundaries.

We have never really been into strict vanilla sex, even when we were in, so all we're really doing is expanding our horizons and experimenting with other stuff that we find interesting. If we come across something that doesn't really gel with one or both of us (and this has been a rare occurrence), we discard it and happily chalk it up to an educational experience. So far that's been working well.

Being out ""in the world"" has made us both much more communicative about our fantasies, thoughts, and desires; we no longer feel the crushing guilt that we had before of being into the kinkier side of life.
