I find myself getting a bit tired of the scenery around Asellus Primus. There was also an unfortunate incident involving a corporate manager, some cargo tie-downs, a synthetic [dogtopus](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y8n2sKY-ktg/TvRQjW2-X5I/AAAAAAAABJY/wS-VJbOMGZI/s1600/dogtopus.jpg), a sentry drone, and a case of bootleg liquor - I can't give the story the justice it deserves, except to say that corporate managers will go to great lengths to secure their secrets, and dogtopus tentacles can apparently go *anywhere.* In my defense, the dogtopus wasn't my idea. I suddenly realize that I am in need of quickly relocating for health reasons to a system far removed from here.

So, fellow space tramps... where do I go from here? I'm afraid that I'm only familiar with the systems immediately around Asellus Primus. Where do you guys find yourselves heading after you tire of your origin systems? Do you stay in Federation space? Do you head out for the Empire, or perhaps the Alliance? Do you seek out the independent systems, or do you venture off into the black?

There is so much out there to see, explore, exploit, and otherwise investigate. I guess I'm just curious to find out where people tend to travel, and perhaps why they went there.

It's not too late to improve ourselves when we wake up from TTATT and get out of the organization. All too often we think that we lost our entire lives (and we did waste a good bit of them, that is true), but there are things we can do to make things better and improve ourselves.

We recently had a couple of posts on here asking for advice about what to do or how to fill time after leaving the organization, and a couple of other posts lamenting that they feel lost after leaving the Borg. If I might suggest it, look into furthering your education. It's amazing how mind-expanding most college courses can be, and they have the added benefit of contributing to a well-rounded life. Plus, if you choose your courses and majors wisely, you can find yourself in a much better employment position (or not, if you select the wrong majors...) Additionally, you will find yourself around other people likewise trying to improve themselves and their lives, who are exploring knowledge as well. Friendships can be made, relationships can be built.

It's not really important, it's honestly not a big deal, but sometimes writing things out clears my head and I'm currently feeling a bit piqued.

Bit o' backstory as to why I don't feel like I can simply cut off contact like a razor: my wife and I have a weird version of a fade going on. I was a convert to the cult at 18 (started studying at 16) and have no family members in Da Troof ^^^TM. My wife is third generation JW; all of her family is in with the exception of one of her brothers, who is mostly out.

Three years ago, we stopped going to meetings, service, and haven't been to a convention or assembly. We haven't been to the Memorial in two years (we went one year just to try to keep peace with my wife's parents.)

Though we haven't officially DA'd, and we haven't been DF'd, we have let her parents know that we have a serious, deep, and irreconcilable disagreement with the current Governing Body and how the organization has changed. We haven't come right out and said ""This is bullshit, we don't believe at all, and you're in a cult,"" but then again we've been pretty clear about where things stand... what we haven't done is made it so that her parents could not maintain a polite fiction if they so chose. My wife's father went to prison during Vietnam for this organization rather than go to war; he refuses to have anything to do with any family member, including his children, if they are outside the organization (and has done so before when one of his sons and his brothers got DF'd... at different times and for different actions, you pervs.) We already know what the reaction will be when we are finally at a point where we can make a break, and at this point and time we are not able to deal with that. I'm not going into details on it, but suffice to say that it involves finances, university, and enough other entanglements that making a clean break is virtually impossible right now. Additionally, you have all the messy stuff caused by the fact that I'm actually fond of and care for my in-laws. I love them, and they are normally quite good people.

During all this time I've been careful about not being too offensive. I make little digs here and there, because I love making people somewhat uncomfortable (but not too uncomfortable as that would just be rude and I try to be a polite person.) I make little jokes. I'm Facebook friends with my wife's mother, because my account was the first one we set up years ago and that's how we update family with pictures of the kids and stuff. Over the past few years I've made posts that were definitely not in line with the organization, but nothing that could be considered over-the-top. I've made a few pro-civil rights posts about the LGBT movement and marriage equality which MIL found offensive, but that's easily hand-waved aside since I have two mothers who are lesbians (not the hot kind, you sick fucks) and as a dutiful son I should express some support of it (I'm actually quite firm in that support.) I've made a few posts that made fun of the political process and candidates, but I didn't endorse any candidate myself. The most controversial and offensive posts I've made were links to the cartoon Cyanide &amp; Happiness, and one post stating ""I fucking hate South Carolina"" when my family got caught up in a massive traffic jam on I-95 which extended through the entire state (the entire fucking state) after Christmas... and the ironic thing there is that I didn't post that comment, my wife did.

Yet that doesn't stop my MIL from using my facebook posts as an excuse to unfriend me. That's not such a big deal, really... I mean, my wife and I had discussed doing it ourselves just to make our lives easier. It would certainly curtail the phone calls asking for an explanation of why I posted something; funnily enough, most of what I posted is stuff that I had posted/had joked about in the Kingdom Hall. The only thing really different is my expressing support for LGBT's. However, I didn't unfriend MIL because I didn't want to cut off that point of contact; it's the best way to get updates on her grandchildren and I feel a responsibility and duty to maintain relationships if I can. I kept MIL as a FB friend because I value loyalty to my loved ones.

Apparently that feeling of loyalty is not reciprocated. I knew it wouldn't be. After all, the cult trumps everything. Still stings though... someone I've known for 15-16 years, and been related to by marriage for 13 years, and whom I've shared many experiences with, whom I have shared mutual emotional support and sacrifice, and whom I genuinely like, love, and care about, will still toss me out of her life (even in such a minor way) just because she doesn't agree with something I might have said, *that wasn't directed towards her at all.*

What pisses me off though is that it's my fault. I didn't do anything outside the norm (except for being friendly with those sinful homosexuals, of course) from the person I was even as a JW... but the reasoning given to my wife as to why my MIL was going to unfriend me is my bad language and offensiveness in my posts to Facebook. I'm the reason she's breaking that line of communication.

In the past 3 months, the only thing offensive on my FB page is a series of Happy Birthday messages to me from various people and my responses (I thanked them, joked with a couple of them who are ex-Dubs, but didn't shut that down as my MIL probably feels I should have), [a Cyanide and Happiness cartoon](http://explosm.net/comics/4163/) (which I found awfully funny and in wonderfully poor taste) and ""I fucking hate South Carolina."" That last wasn't even mine, dammit.

**The reality is that we went up to North Carolina to spend time with my two moms over the holidays.** We went up to North Carolina, and my in-laws knew we celebrated Christmas with my family. This happened last year as well, with MIL accusing us of going apostate, and me agreeing with her. That was a fun conversation.

The reality is that this is a petty slap in the face to me for daring to mislead her daughter and grandchildren into being evil.

Since I'm not one to rise above returning pettiness for pettiness, I unfriended her first. I decided I wasn't going to be the dumpee, but rather the dumper. Childish, I know... but I'm feeling rather offended by this whole stupid set of circumstances. I'm really offended that rather than being honest about her reasons (that she doesn't like that we went to celebrate Christmas with my family, that I'm supportive of the fact that my two moms are lesbians, and that she's choosing to cut off a line of communication in which we provide updates about her grandchildren because she's a JW) that she would instead try to place the blame on me and say that I'm posting offensive language. It's like being abused by my stepfather as a kid, or by my wife in my first marriage... no matter what I did or didn't do, if that person decided they were pissed at me for any reason whatsoever, or they felt like lashing out at me, then I was going to be deserving of that treatment and guilty of something even if they had to manufacture a reason for it out of nothing.

That hurts.

Questions arise as a result that are often taken for granted by people who are actively involved in the process. Here in the US, many of us exJW's support one candidate over another, but may not know quite how the voting system works. I am certainly no expert, but I thought I'd share **[this](http://www.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/presidential-elections/congressional-and-presidential-primaries-open-closed-semi-closed-and-top-two/)** with you if you were interested.

Party Primaries are fast approaching. Want to be a voice in helping select the presidential nominee for your political party of choice? Want to make sure that one candidate is chosen over the others? Check the voting regulations in your state (it's quick and easy for most of us.)

If you live in an Open Primary state, voters of **any** affiliation can vote in the primary of any party they choose, though they cannot vote in more than one primary.

For Closed Primary states (like my own), you can only vote in the primaries if you are registered with a given party. If you're not registered with any particular party (you're an independent) then you can still vote for whomever you want on Election Day, you simply cannot vote in the primary to help select who gets to that point.

For Semi-Closed Primaries, if you are unaffiliated with any party you can choose which party primary to vote in while those registered as any party can only vote in the primary they are affiliated with.

There are some other types of voting systems, but those three are the majority here in the US.

I bring this up because a number of us here in this subreddit have mentioned wanting to see (as an example) Bernie Sanders win the Democratic nomination (leading into becoming president, then Supreme Leader, then Global Overlord, and eventually [Emperor of Mankind,](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Emperor_of_Mankind) only with less Golden Throne and more vitality.) However, if you are like me and registered as an independent and you happen to live in a closed primary state, then you have no input into who gets onto the Democratic nomination. While he may break with the party and go independent if he doesn't win the nomination, that is probably not going to happen (and if it did, he likely wouldn't win a presidential bid anyway because of the fucked up two-party system that dominates American politics.) Thus, if you are in a position like I am, if you want to be a part of the primary process in a closed state you have to swallow your bile and register as either a Republican or Democrat before the cutoff date to do so arrives. Personally, since most of my ideals seem to align on the liberal side of things, that's not too hard a pill to force down my gullet... but your mileage may vary. Oh, and you can always switch back to independent later on if you want.

Again, just thought I'd offer this up for any fellow exJW's not familiar with how the primary system works here in America (specifically in closed primary states) and for those who might want to vote in the primaries though they are registered as independents currently. I am not telling anyone they need to endorse anyone in particular ^^^^^vote ^^^^^for ^^^^^Sanders!!! ; vote for whomever best represents you ^^^^Sanders ^^^^represents ^^^^you ^^^^best, ^^^^vote ^^^^for ^^^^Sanders!!! .
