In case you're confused, と here is the conditional particle, not the quote particle. As you know, you have to have a だ before a conditional と after nouns and na-adjectives.

You could understand it as a contraction of ""何でもかんでも作って売って、というようなやりかただとお店のやりくりが大変ですけど"". So 何でもかんでも作って売って is describing a noun, in this case やりかた, but in colloquial speech like this the noun is left out and implied.",2016-08-10 12:16:01+00:00,d6bp4a7,1.0,t3_4x0q8p,22689,LearnJapanese

ようとする is not the same よう as in the first. It is the しよう/食べよう/踊ろう/話そう form of the verb, and it only happens to take the form よう for a part of the verbs.
