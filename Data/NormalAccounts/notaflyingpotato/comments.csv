You keep bringing this up every time you interact with me on reddit and also a few times on your sub, that's not what ""not giving a fuck"" looks like.

I mean, ""everyone"" knows isn't proof or an argument and now that you've run out of argument you just resort, again, to insults, it's pretty funny to see.

For like the hundredth time, I banned you and the two or three other people in that thread because you were bringing drama, not because you called someone ageist. You're constantly deforming everything to fit your false narrative and when you don't have any proof you resort to childish insults.

325,"The Left Communists were the left wing of the third international. They were Marxists who supported the 1917 Russian Revolution (i.e. the uprising of the peasants and workers), but differed with the centre and right wings of the Bolsheviks (there were left communists in the Bolshevik party, including the worker opposition which was the first groups to be purged) over a number of issues including the formation of the Soviet government in the U.S.S.R., the reformist tactics of the Comintern in Europe and America, the role to be given to autonomous and spontaneous organisations of the working class as opposed to the political parties, participation in Parliament, the relationship with the conservative trade unions and the trade union leadership.

There are two main currents of “Left Communism” stemming from the third international: on one hand there are the “Council Communists” (the term used by the Dutch and German Left Communists after 1928) who criticised the elitist practices of the Bolshevik Party, and increasingly emphasised the autonomous organisations of the working class, reminiscent in some ways of the anarcho-syndicalists and who would later adopt an ""anti-party"" stance. And there is the Italian left communists who reject compromise with the institutions of bourgeois society, participation (or the idea of taking over the trade unions), the dictatorship over the proletariat, against various fronts with bourgeois parties and both are against national-liberation struggles and all forms of nationalism, the bolshevisation of the third international parties and eventually they both agree on the state-capitalist and counter-revolutionary nature of the Russian state by about the early 1920s.

The main figures of Left Communism were: Karl Korsch, Anton Pannekoek, Paul Mattick, Herman Gorter, Otto Rühle and Amadeo Bordiga.

In addition to this there is also another more contemporary current which can generally be described as the ultra-left, which can include people like Dauve and who don't necessarily stem from the historical roots of the traditional left communist parties.

436,"&gt;If Marx liked cheese, would liking cheese be Marxist? If Marx disliked ham, would liking ham be un-Marxist?

Marx didn't write thousand of pages on ham and cheese.

&gt;Is Zizek not a Marxist?

No he isn't, he's just a glorified socdem.

&gt;In fact, hell, throw out all psychoanalytic theory from the ""Marxist"" tent, since Marx and Freud never met; there goes the Frankfurt School.

What are you even talking about? How does saying that Marx's analysis of capitalism constitutes ""marxism"" (I don't even like that label but for practical purposes I guess I'll use it) make the Frankfurt School not marxist?

&gt;There's a reason the words ""Classical Marxism"" exist

There's no such thing as that.

&gt; there is a ""Marxist"" perspective on everything under the sun.

Just because someone who calls themselves marxist analyses something doesn't make the analysis marxist. It's the same for people who call themselves marxist, they aren't necessarily one just because they say it.

&gt;When a thinker with such influence develops into a school of thought, you have to account for development within the school.

Yeah but you have to sift through a lot of shit (for example leninism) before finding something worthwile in these ""developments"".

&gt;That article actually calls Kautsky ""the guardian of orthodoxy"" and ""almost universally regarded as the most knowledgeable expert on the work of Marx and Engels and their privileged interpreter"".

Ahahahah, holy shit, have you actually read the article or did you just skim through it trying to find a quote that contradicts me? By ""orthodoxy"" he means ""orthodox marxism"" which, contrary to what the name would let you think, has nothing to do with marxism. It was basically the ideology of the SPD and therefore of the Second Internationale (the one that disintegrated in the face of WWI). It was merely social democracy. 

Also, Dauvé says he was *regarded* as the ""most knowledgeable expert on the work of Marx and Engels"" but, if you actually read the article, you'd realise that Dauvé violently disagrees with that statement, so do I and so did pretty much everyone post-WWI.

Lol, what is it, then?

&gt;This is somThe Soviet Union was Marxist in that it subscribed to Marxist analysis of history

What? Just because they said that the past was an history of class struggles, it makes them somehow marxist? There's no such thing as a marxist state. There's either a DotP, which isn't really a state in the common meaning of the word, or a classic state which is inherently counter-revolutionary, no matter how social democratic it is.

&gt;Leninist theory was founded on - if obviously not identical to - Marx's prescriptions

That's just not true. I would invite you to read [this](https://libcom.org/library/renegade-kautsky-disciple-lenin-dauve) article on how kautsky's social democracy still influenced Lenin deeply and tainted his ideology.

459,"/u/Tiako never said that cultures didn't exist.

Capitalism is the same, you are 100% right that ""you can't put capitalism under a microscope, nor is there a platonic form of capitalism floating in the ether"" but that doesn't mean capitalism doesn't exist. Capital is very real and we can observe it as a material reality every day of our lives, money, commodities, states and etc, these are actual things that we can see and they compose capitalism.

464,"&gt;I don't have any examples on hand but every debate on Reddit between Stalinists and leftcoms is a back and forth of Marx quotes and claims that the other side doesn't know what they're talking about.

I've never personally quoted Marx to anyone but I don't see anything inherently wrong with that? Usually MLs like to justify state atrocities using Marx so we correct them. If they chose another person's texts to distort, then I imagine we would correct them about that too.

&gt;When an ideology is created centering around a particular individual, this is often the outcome.

I'm pretty sure the same things happens with anarchism, only there's more thinkers to debate about. Marxism isn't only Marx, either.

465,"&gt;I do remember making a general statement once that debates between Marxists often come down to arguing about what Marx really meant instead of developing original critiques.

Do you have any examples of this?

&gt;I somewhat remember saying that left communists are very invested in presenting Marx in a particular way that is probably not consistent with who Marx actually was. Stalinists do this too of course, and it's basically been the task of all Marxists to portray Marx a certain way since the day he died, beginning with Kautsky (if not before).

Don't you think this happens with every well known intellectual figure?

650,"&gt;I don't recall ever mentioning any social democratic politics.

Politics like mutualism, market anarchism and anarcho syndicalism are just aiming at creating a nicer capitalism so I consider them social democratic.

&gt;Also, nice attempt to just completely disregard everything I just typed.

What more did you want me to say? You just told me ""these people believe that capitalism is socialism and therefore capitalism is socialism"". You didn't try to explain to me how money is compatible with a classless society. Just saying that people believe certain things don't make these things true, some people believe our planet was created 5000 years ago, that doesn't make that claim any less bullshit.

&gt;Like, I knew you were always washed up with ideology but I never knew it was this bad.

You're the one who has switched ideology 4-5 times in the last three months.

758,"&gt;Even if state control of the local economy by a native elite can keep more of the profit generated locally for investment in the home country, however, the leftist fallacy is the assumption that this will enhance the position of the working class of that country, rather than advancing the power of the local boss class. In short, the conflict between the industrialized countries and third world nationalism is a tug of war over the division of the total booty, that is, over the relative shares controlled by the bosses of the different countries.

[...]

&gt;The logic of the nation-state system is similar to that of competition in the sphere of production. The world's productive forces are divided into competing business organizations where each can survive only as long as its sales revenue is greater than its costs. Competition forces companies to constantly seek innovations that lower their per unit costs, especially labor costs. A company with greater resources will be much more likely to survive in the constantly changing world of market forces and attempts by competitors to take away their market share. A company must pursue economic expansion to survive in such a world.

&gt;Competition between nation-states has the same logic, leading inevitably to the ""arms race,"" that is, technological innovation to enhance the destructive power that a state can bring to bear on the world scene. ""Dominate or be dominated"" is as much the logic of competition between nation-states as between businesses. The imperialist tendency is inherent in every state.

&gt;**The formation of new nation-states can no more put an end to imperialism than the formation of new businesses can put an end to capitalism. The ""defeat"" of one empire in this or that region, or the long-term decline of a formerly dominant power, will not bring an end to the system of imperialism but merely facilitate the rise of a new empire, or the rise of numerous mini-imperialist tendencies, with all the dangers of military conflict that implies.**

848,"How do you get ""we have to seize state power"" from that:

&gt;""Present-day society"" is capitalist society, which exists in all civilized countries, more or less free from
medieval admixture, more or less modified by the particular historical development of each country,
more or less developed. On the other hand, the ""present-day state"" changes with a country's frontier. It is
different in the Prusso-German Empire from what it is in Switzerland, and different in England from
what it is in the United States. The ""present-day state"" is therefore a fiction.

&gt;**Nevertheless, the different states of the different civilized countries, in spite or their motley diversity of
form, all have this in common: that they are based on modern bourgeois society, only one more or less
capitalistically developed. They have, therefore, also certain essential characteristics in common. In this
sense, it is possible to speak of the ""present-day state"" in contrast with the future, in which its present
root, bourgeois society, will have died off.**

&gt;The question then arises: What transformation will the state undergo in communist society? In other
words, what social functions will remain in existence there that are analogous to present state functions?

[..]

&gt;Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the
one into the other. **Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be
nothing but the *revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat*.**

The DotP isn't a state like you imagine it to be, if you stick with the, imo, simplistic definition of the state as the ""instrument of oppression by one class of the other"" than I guess you could technically call it a state but that's not a better understanding of it than most tankies have. The DotP is the organ of working class power, the form it will take might be something resembling the council republics we saw appearing during the post WWI revolutionary wave or it might be something entirely new and radically different since capitalist society has changed a lot since then.

In the end, it doesn't matter what you or me think is the best way to communism since revolutions aren't an ideological affair, the proletariat doesn't rise against its oppressors because enough of them have read Bakunin or Marx. What Marx was trying to describe is the way the proletariat liberates itself and with it the rest of humanity, he's not trying to give a blueprint on how to do it.",2016-06-23 17:23:05+00:00,d4l1aq8,9.0,t1_d4kqjmb,14378.0,shittankiessay

988,"Some interesting excerpts about the CGT (the biggest french union):

&gt;The CGT had already started walking when we got there, presumably to stop the non-affiliated sections of the march from taking the head.

[...]

&gt;On this, Thursday 12th’s march, the CGT were openly collaborating with the police to control the demonstration, and this was evident as the vans broke through police lines, without helping pedestrian protesters, or those younger, or masked, through as well.

[...]

&gt;On Tuesday, the collaboration of the CGT with the police continued. The Service d’Ordre de CGT, who are a section of that union, were out in a huge block. The SO are basically self-elected strongmen from each union who are supposed to control the march - apparently this didn’t always have a collaborative aspect – in the last weeks their aim seems to be to try to get the head of the demonstration. They resemble, in their helmets and build, the BAC (the undercover cops). Some Service d’Ordre – two pathetic Stalinist men with long sticks - had attacked the march on Thursday, and the crowd rushed at them, throwing whatever they could – bins, rubbish, bottles. The discourse against the casseurs (breakers) has seemed to strengthen in the last week, since the Loi was passed, and it seems the unions want to strengthen this distinction, between those who ‘work’ (in more secure, unionised jobs) and ironically those who can’t work or don’t in the same capacity (so, the salariat, précariat, the kids from the banlieue, the MILI: Mouvement Inter-Luttes Indépendents, the lycéens).

1045,"&gt;Every single social gain workers have under capitalism has been won primarily through the work of unions.

Not through the work of workers? Read [that](https://libcom.org/history/1926-british-general-strike) article and tell me that unions aren't just the last line of defence of the bourgeoisie. Here's some quotes:

&gt; Union leaders were terrified at the possibility of a General Strike. J.R. Cleynes of the General and Municipal Workers union said clearly “I am not in fear of the capitalist class. The only class I fear is our own.”

[...]

&gt;And what was the TUC doing while the British ruling class were preparing for the biggest fight in British union history? Very little. The bosses had said clearly that miners would be locked out on May 1 if their demands weren’t met. On April 27 1926, three days before the showdown was to begin, the TUC General Council met for the first time. The TUC asked to speak to the PM, desperate to find some way out of this conflict. While sipping on cherry and begging for mercy with government officials, the TUC did nothing to organise the workers for battle, so the workers organised themselves.

[...]

&gt;On May 1, one million miners were locked out and the TUC took over the dispute...immediately rushing to the government for talks. At 11pm the miners’ leaders came to the table and rejected the ridiculous sell-out negotiated by the TUC.

[...]

&gt;The compromise was put to the miners’ leaders who rejected it 12 – 6. The TUC General Council, however, was ready to accept it but found that by now the government wasn’t listening. The TUC were trapped in their worst nightmare, both government and workers willing to fight.

[...]

&gt;But by now there were four million workers out on strike who willing to fight. Transport was crippled with London being solid. o­n May 4, 15 out of 315 tubes ran, 300 out of 4,400 buses (by the end of the week this was down to 40), nine out of 2,000 trams operated. By the end of the first day builders, printers, dockers, iron, steel, metal, heavy chemical, transport and railway workers were out on strike. All with the TUC stuck like rabbits in headlights. The working class was truly in the driving seat. Nothing moved unless the workers said it could move.

[...]

&gt;Churchill started printing the British Gazette whose sole aim was to print lies about the strike and spread ruling class propaganda. In response the TUC produced The British Worker. The stated aim of this paper was to rally the working class around the strike and increase the militancy of the movement. However what it actually did was mainly refute Gazette accusations that the unions were organising revolution. It attempted to keep control of the millions of men and women involved in the strike. Jimmy Thomas of the TUC admitted to the Commons o­n May 13 that “If by any chance it should have got out of the hands of those who would be able to exercise some control, every sane man knows what would have happened...that fear was always in our minds”.

[...]

&gt;But locally, the workers were very well organised. Councils of Action were set up and grew in both size and authority across the country. They organised transport, picketing, entertainment and financial assistance for those in need. East Fife set up a workers defence militia which had a membership of 700 and had regular clashes with state forces. In many areas, workers produced high-quality strike bulletins. All this, however, was condemned by the TUC.

[..­.]

&gt;Russia gave the British Communist Party their lead. It was simple: “this is not a revolutionary movement. It is a simple wage dispute.”

[...]

&gt;The TUC, trying to control its members, issued a statement calling for workers to “Stand firm. Be loyal to instructions and trust your leaders.”

[...]

&gt;Regardless, on May 11, just one week into a strike growing in confidence, the TUC called off the strike. Union leaders claimed “assurances had been given”. Some assurances! After the strike, over 3,000 people were prosecuted and wages were slashed. The working class had been betrayed and the bosses took their advantage.

[...]

&gt;The day after the strike was called off, 100,000 more workers were out than on the first day of the strike. It would be a big mistake to confuse the unions’ spineless acts with the workers. After the strike was called off “the temper of the workers was more militant than ever...feeling was bitter – bitter against employers who were everywhere victimising the local strike stalwarts, and bitter against the TUC General Council.

&gt;The ruling class had spent hundreds of millions of pounds but they would have lost had it not been for the concerted campaign of sabotage carried out by the TUC.

And that's just one strike, this kind of thing happened and keeps happening repeatedly every time a strike goes farther than just asking for better wages.",2016-06-01 19:38:30+00:00,d3s4zxu,6.0,t1_d3s3o9e,1702.0,socialism

1171,"&gt;The radical opposition between serving the capitalist state and fighting for the working class was demonstrated by Benn himself during his spell as energy minister in the 70s, when he directly confronted the unofficial power workers’ strike against Labour’s Social Contract (i.e. government imposed wage cuts). This included a plan to use troops to carry out the power workers’ jobs (i.e., strikebreaking).

1179,"&gt; ‘The front’ had come to be
thought of as a mythical far-off place to which young men disappeared and either did not
return or returned after three or four months with vast sums of money in their pockets. (A
militiaman usually received his back pay when he went on leave.)

-

&gt; If you had enough money there was nothing that you could
not get in any quantity, with the possible exception of bread, which was rationed fairly strictly.

-

&gt;A day or two after the street-fighting I remember passing through one of the fashionable
streets and coming upon a confectioner's shop with a window full of pastries and bonbons of
the most elegant kinds, at staggering prices. It was the kind of shop you see in Bond Street or
the Rue de la Paix. And I remember feeling a vague horror and amazement that money could
still be wasted upon such things in a hungry war-stricken country.

-

&gt;After several months of discomfort I had a
ravenous desire for decent food and wine, cocktails, American cigarettes, and so forth, and I
admit to having wallowed in every luxury that I had money to buy.

All those are from Hommage to Catalonia by George Orwell.

1278,"&gt;Che Guevara was sympathetic to Peronism and imbibed most of its ideas. In many ways he was to
remain under the spell of Peronist ideology all his life. In 1955, after he had opted for Stalin, he could
also claim that “we have to give Peron all possible support…” (p. 127)1 When Peron fell he stated: “I
will confess with all sincerity that the fall of Peron deeply embittered me…Argentina was the Paladin
of all those who think the enemy is in the North.” (p. 182) During the Cuban revolution, Che called
his new guerrilla recruits Los Descamisados (p. 231), the name Peron gave to his followers.

[...]

&gt;One can see Peronist (and generally fascist) influence in many aspects of Che’s thinking. In terms
of what was needed to make a revolution, Che believed that “What was required to make political
headway…was strong leadership and a willingness to use force.” (p. 50) Che was never concerned
about Fidel’s dictatorial and autocratic ways. He believed the true revolution could only be achieved
by a “strongman.” (p. 319)

[...]

&gt;As head of the Cuban economy, Che was ultimately responsible for the abolition of workers’ rights
and of the destruction of the independent trade union movement. Of the former, by late 1960, workers
had lost the right to strike, job security, sick leave, the 44 hour week, overtime at time and a half, paid
vacations, and were forced to do “voluntary labor.”3 As for the trade unions, as well as liquidating
anarcho-syndicalism, the regime tried to get the Communist Party slate elected to the leadership of
the Cuban Labor Confederation (CTC). This was rejected by 90% of the delegates. The Stalinists were
imposed from above by the State. The leader of the CTC, David Salvador, an important member of
the 26th of July Movement, no less, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his opposition to the
Stalinist takeover of his union. He spent his time behind bars in a prison with some 700 other political
prisoners, many of whom, no doubt, were trade unionists.4 Che’s guilt in these matters could not be
plainer, for in October 1960 he stated, “the destiny of unions is to disappear” and supported Law 647,
by which “The Minister of Labor can take control of any union, dismiss officials and appoint others…”5

[...]

&gt;He was “notoriously
severe” with his punishments. One time he threatened to shoot a number of guerrillas who had gone
on a hunger strike over the bad provisions. Only Fidel’s intervention stopped him.

[...]

&gt;Che is implicated in the destruction of Cuban anarcho-syndicalism, (and Trotskyism as well). Cuba
in the 1950’s was the scene of the last of the great Latin American syndicalist movements. (See Appendix.)
Libertarians controlled many trade unions and were an important anti-Batista force. The
anarchists had survived the Machado and Batista dictatorships but did not survive two years of Castroism.
By 1962 the movement was down to 20 or 30 members, hundreds of others having fled into
exile, imprisoned or executed

&gt;Next we can take a meat-cleaver to production work itself. No more war production, **nuclear power**, junk food, **feminine hygiene deodorant** — and above all, **no more auto industry to speak of. An occasional Stanley Steamer or Model T might be all right**, but the auto-eroticism on which such pest-holes as Detroit and Los Angeles depend is out of the question. **Already, without even trying, we’ve virtually solved the energy crisis, the environmental crisis and assorted other insoluble social problems.**

How does stopping the development of one of the most promising source of clean energy solve the energy and environmental crisis? What's wrong with cars in general and why the fuck would I want a model T when I can have a car with airbags that is all around much safer to drive? And, finally, what's wrong with feminine hygiene and deodorant? I don't think many women would like to stop using pads and tampon lol. Is the author a weird kind of anarcho-primitivist? 

Also:

&gt;We should be more than skeptical about the promises of the computer mystics. They work like dogs; chances are, if they have their way, so will the rest of us.

I guess that's more understandable since it was written in the 80s but the computer should definitely be a major part of our post-work communist society if we want to make it work (pun intended).

And finally:

&gt;All the scientists and engineers and technicians freed from bothering with war research and planned obsolescence should have a good time devising means to eliminate fatigue and tedium and danger from activities like mining. Undoubtedly they’ll find other projects to amuse themselves with. Perhaps they’ll set up world-wide all-inclusive multi-media communications systems or found space colonies.

1395,"I'm also from Québec but here's something I wrote in a PM like a week ago:

From what I gather, it seems to be quite a lot like the occupy movement except that they have a strong disdain for political parties. They are of course a leftist movement but there's a lot of different political beliefs among them, from some vague class collaborationist social democracy to hardline anti-capitalism (the left of the left, like one protester said).

I think the most interesting aspects of it all is the rejection of parties and unions and the daily General Assembly. There is definitely an undertone of radicalism that might be ""hidden"" a bit by the mainstream media. For example, on [this](http://i.imgur.com/rb6wiIP.jpg) image we can see ""Que revive la Commune"" which means ""Bring back the Commune"" or this, said by a protester:

&gt;On s’entraîne à écrire la Constitution, simplement pour se rendre compte qu’on peut le faire nous-même

&gt;We're practising writing the Constitution simply to realise that we can do it ourselves

Another big theme seems to be the opposition to the *Parti Socialiste* (Socialist Party) which has been the biggest ""left"" party in France for decades but is now as much of a neoliberal party as *Les Républicains* (yes, that's Republicans, like in the US). What sparked a lot protests recently in France is the revision of the ""Loi du Travail"" (Labour Law) to essentialy abolish the gains made by the working class in the last 50 years so there's a big overlap between the protests against this law and the Nuit Debout protesters.

1398,"&gt;You must be the third person from Québec I've had a lengthy chat with recently.

That's strange lol.

&gt;Anything interesting you know of I'd never get to hear otherwise?

The current leader of the Parti Québecois (our nationalist party, it used to be left-wing nationalism but now it's just good old center-right neoliberalism with a touch of xenophobia) changed his first name from Pierre-Carl to Pierre-Karl because he was a big fan of Karl Marx. He's a billionaire, the head of his father's media empire and anti-unions, now. I don't really know what to talk about. What's the kind of thing you're curious about?

&gt;How does it vary from the rest of Canada?

Much more left-wing, like you say. Even though the party currently in power (The Liberal Party, like in Australia) is neoliberal, it's like a soft version of neoliberalism and literally every party that gets more than 1% of votes is socially progressive. We don't have social conservatives, it seems. There's a big homosexual community in Montreal, they even have their own district (*Le Village*, the town) and it's one of the most fun place in the city, if you ask me. 

In federal elections, we're usually the province that tips the balance to the left. In 2011, Québec was responsible for the massive increase in votes for the NDP, a social-democratic party while the rest of Canada voted massively Conservative. In 2015, we helped put the liberals in power with their leftish platform, since the NDP went too much to the right, trying to gain votes in the rest of Canada. It's strange, federally, the province always votes for the left but, provincially, it votes for the right. 

I don't think the far-left ever played much of a role in our poltics, with maybe the exception of the FLQ, a nationalist terrorist group who was also Marxist-Leninist. The provincial government asked Trudeau (the father of the Trudeau we have in power today), the PM, to send in the army and declare martial law. There were hundreds of arrests and the FLQ was repressed. 6 years later the Parti Québecois was elected and we had a refendum about Québec's independence which resulted in us staying in Canada.",2016-04-23 19:16:23+00:00,d2ejt9t,12.0,t1_d2e7ppz,22847.0,leftcommunism

Yes, that was me. 

&gt;Many local folklore heroes are what they call bushrangers, people in the ~1800s who took ""fuck the police"" as far as it would go.

That would make good movies. Instead of killing indians like in american westerns, they'd kill pigs! A much more positive message if you ask me.

&gt;Anti-authority sentiment in that sense lingers on, particularly in crowds that'd get described as blue-collar.

It's strange socialism never was that big there, then, with that kind of sentiment being relatively widespread.

Yes, I agree. Perhaps I was approaching it with too much of a detached point of view, viewing it in term of usefulness instead of an expression of alienation.

&gt;The school is not some liberated zone but as necessary to the functioning of todays capitalist system as the police station (if not more so)...so in that sense attacking a police station should take place alongside attacking the school (here students are synonymous with workers in their response to the respectable calls towards 'controlling' workplaces/school, the response is ""no, I want to burn the workplace/school down"").

Yet again, I agree, I guess I still think school (even in the state it is now) has some potential to make positive change. Do you think I'm naive to think that?

1448,"&gt;That'd be communism, and it's supposed to be the goal, but Marx thought a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" is necessary to achieve it, if I remember correctly.

The DotP is *not* a state, that's an important distinction. The DotP is merely the proletariat having power and using it to end classes and therefore property, the remnants of the State, wage-labor and etc.

&gt;I'm not exactly sure how a Marxist would explain what went wrong in these cases.

If you want a left communist perspective (definition of left communism [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/leftcommunism/comments/4b5488/meta_should_we_write_a_brief_left_communism_101/d167zhz)), I would say that the so-called communist states were actually the counter-revolution. Take Russia, for example, the Russian Revolution was a proletarian one but was hijacked by the Bolsheviks who took state power and, to consolidate their power in the face of the failure of the international revolution, started repressing the working class. 

The turning point, the counter-revolution started earlier but that was the definite defeat of the revolution, would be the repression of the Kronstadt revolt by Trotsky and the Red Army. At the same time, there were massive strikes in Petrograd and the city was put under martial law and the strikers forced back to work by the army and the secret police.

For all this talk of evidence they don't present a lot of it.

&gt;Third they were offered a chance to talk which they refused.

That's like literally the contrary to what happened. To quote Victor Serge (who, as you probably know, was sympathetic of the Bolsheviks): 

&gt;Some American Anarchists—Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and a young man named Perkus, the secretary of the Russian Workers Union in the United States—had arrived a short time before. A scheme for mediation took shape in the course of some talks I had with them on several successive evenings. When I told some of the party comrades about it, they countered:

&gt;&gt;""That won't do any good. We're bound by party discipline, and so are you"".

&gt;&gt;I protested: ""One can get out of a party"".

&gt;&gt;Cool, unsmiling, they replied: ""No Bolshevik deserts his party. And, anyway, where would you go? Ours is the only party, to put it mildly.""

&gt;The Anarchist mediation group used to meet at the home of my father-in-law, Alexander Roussakov. Since the Anarchists had the ear of the Kronstadt Soviet, it had been decided that only Anarchists would take part in the negotiations, and that the American anarchists alone would assume responsibility vis-à-vis the Soviet government; so I was not present. Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman had an interview with Zinoviev. They were received cordially, for they were still able to speak authoritatively in the name of a section of the international proletariat. Their mediation scheme, nevertheless, was a complete failure. As a sop, Zinoviev offered them every facility for seeing Russia from a private railway car. ""Think it over and you will understand"". Most of the Russian members of the mediation group were arrested. I was not—an indulgence which I owed to the good opinion that Zinoviev, Zorin and a few others had of me, and to my position as a militant in the French workers' movement.

They jailed the russians in the mediation group and tried to bribe Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. ",2016-04-17 00:40:11+00:00,d25t8hg,1.0,t3_4f40kp,8236.0,shittankiessay

1474,"R2:

I'm more interested in the ""political"" part, here, for obvious reasons.

&gt;Orwell was, to apply the obligatory labels, a socialist, a social democrat and even by some accounts, an anarchist.

Here they note the difference between socialist and social democrat, which is suprising since after that they liken socialism with government which is usually done when social democracy and socialism are confounded together.

&gt;He saw the rise and fall of the fascist dictatorships of Mussolini’s Italy, Hitler’s Germany and Franco’s Spain. 

I don't think he saw the fall of Franco since he died in 1950.

&gt;siding with the anarchists 

And the marxists since he literally fought in the POUM's milicias.

&gt;But this brings up an interesting contradiction. Can one be both an anarchist and a socialist? They do seem to be quite ideologically distinct.  

Anarchism is and always has been a far-left movement dedicated to the destruction of capitalism and is therefore socialist and communist. I assume they think the abortion that is anarcho-capitalism is ""anarchism"" but it isn't, except in name. The absolute ignorance of the writers about basic poltical ideologies for a website that has the stated goal of categorizing « the religions and political views of the influentials » is pathetic.

The same website also has one for Marx and it's as bad as you imagine.",2016-04-14 21:16:59+00:00,d234zvx,1.0,t3_4etbfx,597.0,badpolitics
1475,"&gt;or Stalinism

Which is capitalism in crisis too. ;)

&gt;I don't know if he ever declared for any specific political idea, but he seems to be anarchist/leftcom-adjacent.

I often feel that well know figures like him who reject both mainstream ""marxism"" (marxism-leninism) and capitalism would probably love left comunism if only they knew about it but I guess that's my personal bias.

&gt;I've read a number of biographies of him, but they're always written by Liberals, Neo-Cons, or ""Apolitical"" types, so they try to place him within their tradition.

I know of one book about Camus that might interest you, it's in french, though. It's called *L'ordre libertaire* by Michel Onfray (who is a quite well known french philosopher, even if he sometimes borders of pop-philosophy) and it's about Camus's life and his philosophical life (the subtitle is ""*La vie philosophique d'Albert Camus*""). I got about a hundred pages in and kind of... stopped reading but it was really interesting. I don't know if it's available in the U.S..

&gt;Besides that, I'd like to write (prose fiction), and exile is good for honing one's thoughts, as in the case of Joyce.

You make me want to read more. I have quite a bit of free time these days (months even) and I feel like I'm wasting it on reddit. I barely manage to read 1h a day (often less) through all the time I waste on reddit and on the computer. I guess that's a \#firstworldproblem but it sucks.

&gt;Still, I consider it one of my favorite philosophical essays

No problem, there's not that many french speaking people on this american website. :P

&gt;the rejection of both Stalinism and Fascism

I thought it was the rejection of both Stalinism (what passed as marxism back then) and Capitalism? 

&gt;His opposition to both French and Algerian nationalism during the Algerian War

Yes, he got so much bullied for that but he was right, after all.

&gt;I would say a lot of the difficulty comes from his rapid-fire discussion of a bunch of obscure phenomenological writers, like Shestov, Jaspers, and others

1563,"I was just reading an [article](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/12/isis-syria-iraq-war-al-qaeda-arab-spring/) about ISIS and I found a few paragraphs that are relevant to what I was saying and I thought it might interest you. Here they are:

&gt;Many commentators writing about Iraq often chalk this outcome [ISIS] up to the stupidity and hubris of the Bush administration, and the succession of obvious policy errors made following the occupation. Such an approach assumes that the United States actually sought a stable and united Iraq.

&gt;Yet a non-sectarian, unified Iraq led by a government with strong popular support would have been a disaster for US interests in the Middle East. Without this possibility ever seriously in the cards, it is not hard to see that from the outset, the fragmentation of Iraq along sectarian lines was the most likely outcome of US occupation (particularly since this also coincided with Iranian interests). Divide and rule has long been a preferred method of colonial domination.

&gt;These are the actual material and political roots of the region’s current sectarian turn. Despite what ISIS, Saudi Arabia, or Iran might claim, sectarianism is not the result of ever-present doctrinal or ethnic schisms, existing since time immemorial and persisting unchanged into the contemporary era.

&gt;It has always been, as the Lebanese communist Mahdi Amel argued decades ago, a modern technique of political power, a means through which ruling classes attempt to establish their legitimacy and social base, while fragmenting the potential for any kind of popular opposition. Post-invasion Iraq and the subsequent rise of ISIS provide a tragic confirmation of this thesis.",2016-04-03 22:47:29+00:00,d1olpj4,10.0,t1_d1mtujv,135472.0,shittankiessay

That's right and that's why I posted this. That doesn't mean it isn't a progressive movement and positive for the indigenous communities there, it's just not socialist.

1666,"&gt;I don't think that it's a coincidence that universities are the home of the Trotskyist and Anarchist student groups, or that the majority of users here who are in college have social-democratic conceptions of class politics.

But what specifically makes students more likely to have ""social-democratic conceptions of class poltics"" more than others?

&gt;Many regular people just use them as useful idiots and regard them as such

What do you mean by that?

You seem to be forgetting that a lot of students also work, especially in the U.S. with the college/university not being free, so it's not like they have no idea what work is. I just read a [small text](http://libcom.org/history/1962-1973-worker-student-struggles-italy) on the industrial struggles in Italy during the late 60s and early 70s and they talk about the radicalisation coming from the university and ""student-workers"". 

&gt;Revolutionary groups sprang up across the country throughout the summer of 1968, and many began to join striking workers on picket lines. This presence, aided by the interlapping of factory and university provided by the ""worker-students"" led to many groups being able to exert considerable influence in the factories, in some cases even completely supplanting existing shop-floor union organisations.

[...]

&gt;With the increase in the availability of further education, thousands of young workers were experiencing the radicalising effect of the universities, and many brought this fresh perspective on their situation back to the factories once their education had finished. This new awareness, coupled with the changing needs of workers in the factories was soon to find expression in the many revolutionary groups that would penetrate the factories and take class struggle in the northern industrial belt to its height. These conditions in the factories perpetuated throughout the mid-60s, until, in 1968, unrest in the northern factories exploded into mass struggle.

There's also, of course, Mai '68 that, as you probably know, united workers and students in a quasi-revolution.

1672,"I found this article really interesting, especially part 2. I haven't read part 3 yet but I expect it to be as good as the two others. Here's an interesting excerpt from part 1:

&gt;For Solnit, the current social order requires constant effort to maintain. She likens it to an electric light, and disasters to a power cut. When the power goes out, literally or metaphorically, there is a spontaneous “reversion to improvised, collaborative, cooperative, and local society” (p.10). The repressive actions of the state – in San Francisco 1906 as much as Katrina in 2005 – are about reimposing state power and capitalist normality.

&gt;The state sees localised self-organisation, collaboration and mutual aid as a threat to be crushed. Which is why the state is often quicker to provide its own citizens with hot lead than fresh water: order must reign. 

Also, this footnote:

&gt;Jason Moore argues that ""as a metaphor for communicating the significant – and growing – problem posed by greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the Anthropocene is to be welcomed"", but that in pinning the problem on 'anthropos' - humanity - rather than specific forms of social organisation - capital - it naturalises the problem and smuggles in neo-Malthusian assumptions. 

Do you know if there's any socialist analysis of language out there? How it's influenced by the dominant ideology of our time, for example.

And some other excerpts, this time from part 2:

&gt;there is no reason to think disasters will lead to social transformation any more than austerity will inevitably lead to revolution. However, climate change does change the parameters for revolution. Things like rising food and energy costs, mass displacement, and water scarcity will increasingly stress the capacity of proletarians to reproduce themselves within the prevailing social relations. 

[...]

&gt;The apparent universality of disaster communities gives strong grounds to believe self-organised social reproduction will emerge wherever capitalist normality breaks down, whether that's due to disaster or social antagonism. Contra-Endnotes, this means we are not restricted to purely negative injunctions:

&gt;Endnotes wrote:

&gt;*What advice [communization theory] can give is primarily negative: the social forms implicated in the reproduction of the capitalist class relation will not be instruments of the revolution, since they are part of that which is to be abolished.*

&gt;We disagree. We think that disaster communities offer a glimpse of what non-capitalist social reproduction can look like under abnormal conditions. Since a revolutionary movement is by definition abnormal, it would be as much of a mistake to dismiss disaster communities as to claim them as sufficient in themselves. This does not mean a simple quantitative accumulation of disasters adds up to communism – only that there are glimpses of non-capitalist social relations in disaster communities. Indeed, it would be impossible to account for disaster communities degenerating back into capitalist normality if they hadn’t at some point operated on at least a partly different logic to that of value and capital accumulation. We argue this is a communist logic of self-organised production and distribution for human needs, without state or market mediation.

I know y'all are big fans of endnotes around here so I'm wondering what you think?

&gt;Of course, we cannot fully specify in advance 'what is to be done', nor would we wish to. That has to be worked out by the participants in the movement as it develops. But that doesn't mean we can’t identify some of the constraints, the possibilities, and the latent potentials which are unable to be realised under capitalist social relations. 

[...]

&gt;Disaster communities are informative in this regard - both in showing how present-at-hand technologies, knowledges, and infrastructure can be rapidly repurposed to meet human needs, and in how these emergent innovations can dissipate and be reabsorbed into capitalist normality. We could go further still, and insist on the need to rediscover a concrete utopianism. Increasingly, it is capital which relies on abstract utopia - for instance building new 'clean' coal power plants with vast empty halls for carbon capture technology that doesn't exist. By contrast, a concrete utopianism looks to the already-present possibilities which are frustrated by the prevailing social relations. 

&gt;Labour-saving technology is everywhere but is experienced as speed-ups and unemployment. Industrial ecology is largely limited to a corporate social responsibility gimmick in a world ruled by value. Collaborative, self-organising, and co-operative forms of production are pioneered but often experienced as self-managed, precarious exploitation. Viable, sustainable, and low throughput agricultural practices exist but are marginalised in the energy-hungry world market. Biophilic cities and regenerative design are largely restricted to isolated demonstration projects or gentrifying urban spaces for the well-off, their potential constrained by class relations.

I thought this was a great example of how capitalism stifles science.

I think you can have a democratically elected centralised leadership, without having a military caste.

&gt;Last I read Orwell, he lamented how the bourgeoisie were returning to normal lives in early 1936, well before the Stalinist factions had a monopoly of political power and force.

He arrived in Barcelona at the end of December 1936, and fled the purges in June 1937.

Other than these two things, I agree with you, I don't doubt that the article isn't perfect. We can both agree that Stalin wasn't a positive force for the revolution, though.

1689,"&gt;their natural impulse was to arm themselves and fight, not to picket and demonstrate.

I don't actually see anything wrong with that? It's much more effective than picketing.

&gt; It's tied up in protestantism, the southern honor culture which dictated that a man bore sole responsibility for upholding his place in society (with violence if necessary), and a generalized fear of outsiders and alien organizations.

Do you think it would be possible to abandon this mentality? I don't know anything about the southern U.S. so I'm wondering how deeply rooted those things are?

&gt;a Communist Party-affiliate union sent officials down to organize the largest mill in the South, and despite some early successes, failed pretty spectacularly

If you work for a wage and a surplus value is extracted from the work you do, you're a prolétaire. It doesn't have much to do with with your education or skin color, it's a social relation with capital.

Anthropology, sociology and history have proven quite definitely that there's no such thing as a ""natural state of man"". Sure, you can be pessimistic (I am) but don't rely on things that don't exist to justify it. ;)

&gt; it's just that I don't think human beings are fundamentally decent enough in the aggregate to reach them

It's not a question of being decent, it's a question of class interest. It's in the interest of the proles to abolish capitalism and class society as whole, it's not some people getting together and trying to change the system because it's not ""decent"" enough.

1768,"TL;DR: Fuck unions, especially those headed by stalinists.

Some interesting segments:

&gt;When the United States entered the war, the leaders of both the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations pledged that there should be no strikes or walkouts for the duration of the war. Thus, at a time when profits were ""high by any standard"" and a great demand for labor meant ""higher wages could be secured ... and a short stoppage could secure immediate results,"" the unions renounced the principal method by which workers could have gained from the situation. Instead, they took on the function of administering government decisions affecting the workplace, disciplining the workforce, and keeping up production. ""To cease production is to strike at the very heart of the nation,"" proclaimed the AFL. The CIO announced it would ""redouble its energies to promote and plan for ever-increasing production."" Over the radio, Philip Murray of the CIO urged labor to ""Work! Work! Work! Produce! Produce! Produce!""

[...]

&gt;Interestingly, the unions with Communist leadership carried this policy furthest. As Business Week noted:

&gt;&gt;""A more conciliatory attitude toward business is apparent in unions which once pursued intransigent policies. On the whole, the organizations involved are those which have been identified as Communist-dominated.... Since Russia's involvement in the war, the leadership in these unions has moved from the extreme left-wing to the extreme right- wing position in the American labor movement. Today they have perhaps the best no-strike record of any section of organized labor; they are the most vigorous proponents of labor-management cooperation; they are the only serious labor advocates of incentive wages.... In general, employers with whom they deal now have the most peaceful labor relations in industry. Complaints to the union's national officers usually will bring all the organization's disciplinary apparatus to focus on the heads of the unruly local leaders.""

[...]

&gt;The sense of solidarity was strong enough so that wildcats often expanded on a large scale. In February 1944, 6,500 Pennsylvania anthracite miners struck to protest the discharge of a fellow worker. Ten thousand workers at the Briggs Manufacturing Company in Detroit struck for one day over a cutback in work schedules. Ten thousand workers at the Timken Roller Bearing Company in Canton, Ohio, struck twice in June 1944 over the general refusal of the employer to settle grievances. In September 1944, 20,000 workers struck for two days at the Ford Willow Run bomber plant against the transfer of workers in violation of seniority rules.

[...]

&gt;The unions and the employers worked hand-in-hand to suppress the wildcats. For example, at the Bell Aircraft Corporation plant in Marietta, Georgia, employees in the electrical department, most of them women, left their jobs after the transfer of a supervisor. Union officials ordered them back to work, but the workers held out for six hours. Next they were called to a meeting in the plant labor relations office. Union officials told them they had forfeited union protection when they broke the no-strike pledge, then company officials handed out discharge slips to the seventy workers.

[...]

&gt;As early as July 1944, The New York Times acknowledged ""labor-management antagonisms which forecast a post-war period of great turmoil in labor relations.""33 The real question was not whether there would be strikes, but whether they would be union-controlled or wildcats.

[...]

&gt;Indeed, most union leaders would have preferred to avoid the strikes of 1946 altogether. They led them only because the rank and file were determined to strike anyway, and only by leading the strikes could the unions retain control of them. In a widely cited Collier's article, business analyst Peter F. Drucker pointed out that in the major strikes of 1945 and 1946, ""it was on the whole not the leadership which forced the workers into a strike but worker pressure that forced a strike upon the reluctant leadership; most of the leaders knew very well that they could have gained as much by negotiations as they finally gained by striking. And again and again the rank and file of the union membership refused to go back to work.""

[...]

&gt;The attitude of top union officials was embodied in the preamble to the 1947 U.S. Steel contract, in which company officials pronounced that they were not anti-union, and union officials stated they were not anti-company but were ""sincerely concerned with the best interests and well-being of the business.""

[...]

&gt;Far from trying to break the unions, management in the large corporations had learned how to use them to control the workers. General Motors' foremost demand in 1946 auto negotiations was ""union responsibility for uninterrupted production.""

[...]

&gt;In this situation, the trade unions played an essential role in forestalling what might otherwise have been a general confrontation between the workers of a great many industries and the government, supporting the employers. The unions were unable to prevent the post-war strike wave, but by leading it they managed to keep it under control. Nonetheless, they were unable to prevent wildcat strikes and other direct challenges by workers to management control.",2016-03-07 02:56:40+00:00,d0qbrmw,1.0,t3_49aj7u,598.0,leftcommunism

1821,"On a related note, I wanted to share another example of the viciousness of stalinists during the Spanish Revolution. That example is a person named [André Marty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Marty).

André Marty, the head of the Comintern from 1935 to 1944, was named Political Commissar of the International Brigades (a brigade  made up of volunteers from everywhere in the world who went to fight fascism in Spain) in 1936. During his two year as Political Commissar, he ordered the execution of tens, maybe hundreds of members of the International Brigades. I remind you that these were *volunteers* who left their homes and families to fight for what they believed in. I think Emma Goldman, in the essay linked above, describes it better here:

&gt;These men from every part of the globe had flocked to Spain, often begging their way across, to help the Spanish revolution, to join the ranks of the anti-fascists and to lay down their lives in the struggle against Franco were held captive. Others again had been picked up on the street and had vanished without leaving any trace behind.

Or here:

&gt;members of the International Brigade who had come to Spain from every land to fight fascism, only to discover the harsh differentiation against them, their officers and the political commissars and the criminal waste of human lives due to the military ignorance and for party purpose and glory. All these and more are incarcerated in the fortress of Montjuich.

These people, who he cynically accused of ""Trotskyism"", are the ones who died at the paranoid hand of André Marty who, of course, received his orders directly from Moscow.",2016-02-25 03:28:56+00:00,d0culdo,1.0,t3_47gw35,1366.0,socialism

&gt;On the USSR, it still had vestiges of socialism, but they were hollowed out by the revisionists in the party that wanted reconciliation with the capitalist powers.

Wtf?

&gt;The basic idea is that the socialist economic logic as well as structural proletarian dominance secured through the constructed state was never fundamentally altered.

It's The People™ who chose to send themselves to labor camps and purge themselves!

&gt;This is why I think sometimes it's actually necessary for the state to be forced to allow for a small, subordinate commodity market. That way, they can keep it under control instead of just letting it grow untouched.

So... like state capitalism?

&gt;was still a revisionist, putting profitability over use value in the USSR's economy

**SOCIALISM**

&gt; the USSR continued to function as a socialist formation, based on its state structure and dominant economic logic.

&gt; I'm not exactly sure how the shadow economy problem is best dealt with, but certainly acknowledging its existence and heavily regulating it through the state is better than ignoring it.

So... like state capitalism?

&gt;I think the shadow economy provided a material base that was exacerbated by and in turn exacerbated the contradictions related to imperialist threat and revisionist party ideology.

His explanation:

&gt;In the face of reactionary military actions... we responded with a devastating action: Lucanamarca. Neither they nor we have forgotten it, to be sure, because they got an answer that they didn't imagine possible. More than 80 were annihilated, that is the truth. And we say openly that there were excesses, as was analyzed in 1983. But everything in life has two aspects. Our task was to deal a devastating blow in order to put them in check, to make them understand that it was not going to be so easy. On some occasions, like that one, it was the Central Leadership itself that planned the action and gave instructions. That's how it was. In that case, the principal thing is that we dealt them a devastating blow, and we checked them and they understood that they were dealing with a different kind of people's fighters, that we weren't the same as those they had fought before. This is what they understood. The excesses are the negative aspect... If we were to give the masses a lot of restrictions, requirements and prohibitions, it would mean that deep down we didn't want the waters to overflow. And what we needed was for the waters to overflow, to let the flood rage, because we know that when a river floods its banks it causes devastation, but then it returns to its riverbed.... [T]he main point was to make them understand that we were a hard nut to crack, and that we were ready for anything, anything.

2033,"They sent me two links, one I couldn't open and one that contained a quote by Bordiga (it wasn't anything written by Bordiga) that said: ""One does not build communism"". The whole context is: 

&gt;Post-war Trotskyists (for whom Trotsky is of course not responsible) saw the industrialization of the Stalinist regimes during the period when the Third World was showing no signs of development anywhere as the definitive proof of their deformed socialist character. Against this attitude, Bordiga said: ""One does not build communism"". The task of the ""development of the productive forces"" is not the task of communists. He also added: ""It is exactly right that the 'foundations of socialism' are being built in the Soviet Union""; for him, this was precisely the proof of the bourgeois character of the regime.

I told them that in this context the quote meant the same thing as this quote by Marx: 

&gt;Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.

I then proposed to send them some texts written by Bordiga and other left communists so they could see by themselves that leftcoms actually think communism is something that comes from the proletariat. They accepted so I sent them some short texts by Bordiga and Pannekoek.

2046,"&gt;From what I've found among the socialist/communist community is that if we keep denouncing each other and continue to seemingly veer around solidarity among ourselves then we've already lost to the capitalists.

I think it's important that we critique ourselves as much as we critique capitalism or liberalism. Capitalist ideology is extremely pervasive and some well intentioned people can find themselves defending counter-revolutionary states without realising it. I think leftcoms (even if I don't identify as one) are perceived to be ""sectarian"" because they apply the marxist concept of ""ruthless criticism of all that exists"".

&gt;Capitalism is inevitable, even in the most communist of systems.

Communism is stateless, classless and moneyless. They think capitalism is ""inevitable"" in ""communism"" because they equate state ownership of the means of production with communism. That's just state-capitalism.

&gt;Yes Capitalism is the natural state of man

Like others said, it seems that the thousands of years humans spent as hunter-gatherer aren't real. Also, it's just another rehash of the ""human nature"" argument, which has been disproved countless of times from many different perspectives. My favorite is a small text by Peter Kropotkin called *[Are We Good Enough?](https://sovversiva.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/are-we-good-enough/)*.

&gt;Capitalism is unlearned. While Socialism can only be enforced through the threat of violence.

The reality is literally the opposite. Capitalism is inherently violent, if you don't work you starve and die, it's as simple. Socialism (and communism, they're the same thing) gives workers control over what they produce and guarantees everyone a good standard of living.

&gt;Communism is at its very best when it is crudely aping capitalism. See: Russian industrial revolution, modern Chinese financial deregulatiom

Again, they have no fucking idea what communism is. The russian industrial revolution was just planned state-capitalism, nothing to do with communism. I don't really understand how they can imagine that chinese financial regulation is communism in any way, shape or form.

I don't understand what you mean by that.

&gt;His experience in that system gives him an advantage

K? I don't really care about his ""experience"" in the system, since I want to destroy the system.

&gt;especially since very few leftists want to have a true, potentially bloody revolution to change the system through aggression.

It doesn't really matter what ""leftists"" want, what matter is that, if a popular revolution were to happen, it would be violently repressed and the prolétariat would have no choice but to defend themselves, unless they want to be slaughtered. Also, again, I don't want to change the system, I want to destroy it.

Almost no *francophones* identify as ""canadian"" in Québec.

&gt;The Canadian government wouldn't be as able to intervene against a popular revolution.

If the conditions were ripe for a revolution in Québec, don't you think they would be for the rest of Canada too? Or even the U.S? It's not like we're that different, we are both first-world nations with about the same societal makeup, the only big difference is that we speak french. 

Also, if there ever was a communist revolution in only Québec, the Canadian bourgeoisie wouldn't give a single fuck if we were independent or not, they would do everything in their power to crush it. Don't forget our neighbor, the United States. They would bomb the fuck out of us if it's what it took to annihilate the revolution. The only possible way a revolution could be successful is by being international. Québecois workers have so much more in common with canadian workers than with their bourgeoisie.

&gt;Any attempt to restart sectarian bickering by wanting to reunify with Canada would die along with the current generation as there hasn't been much of a history of violence so it's unlikely the children of federalists will care.

What does that have to do with socialism?

&gt;Before it's brought up again yes Native sovereignty must be upheld and the current treatment of aboriginal peoples is absolutely unacceptable and should be a top priority.

Yeah sure but I don't see why a french speaking bourgeoisie would change anything to that. Most of our bourgeoisie is already french speaking anyway and it didn't help the natives.

&gt; but for english Canadians to accuse Quebecois of being more racist is absolutely hypocritical and ridiculous.

I don't know if that was directed at me, but i'm a *francophone* born in Québec. The rampant racism running in the *séparatiste* movement is fucking disgusting and toxic.

&gt;Frank Capra managed to fool just about everyone; even his wife was unsure of his political affiliations. Longtime co-workers who were Democrats assumed he shared their political convictions. Katharine Hepburn, who starred in his 1948 picture ""State of the Union,"" thought him ""quite liberal""; others applied the term ""radical"" to him. And why shouldn't they have, when Variety was calling a sympathetic character in ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" ""quasi-communistic"" and The Saturday Evening Post was reporting that in the Soviet Union Capra was ""hailed as a comrade""? But as Mr. McBride, the author of previous books on Howard Hawks, John Ford and Orson Welles, tells us, Capra was a lifelong Republican who never once voted for Roosevelt. He was an admirer of Franco and Mussolini. In later years, during the McCarthy period, he served as a secret F.B.I. informer.

&gt;In part, the misperception was due to Capra's writers, who generally ranged from New Deal Democrats to card-carrying Communists. One of Capra's great strengths as a director in the 1930's was his ability to work with anyone who had something to contribute to his pictures, even those who were far to his left. He was also enough of a popular entertainer to cater to his audiences; he understood that during the Depression the most hissable villains were grasping bankers and businessmen.

Some good quotes:

&gt;Not much remains from the turbulent period when the Cambodians tried to radically change the order of things in the course of their unique traditionalist conservative peasant revolution under communist banner. That was the glorious time of Jean Luc Godard and his La Chinoise, of the Cultural Revolution in China sending party bonzes for re-education to remote farms, of Khmer Rouge marching on the corrupt capital. Socialist movement reached a bifurcation point: whether to advance to more socialism Mao-style, or retreat to less socialism the Moscow way.


A ""traditionalist conservative peasant revolution"" is supposed to be a good thing? ""More socialism"" or ""Less socialism"".

&gt;Surprisingly, Cambodians have no bad memories of that period.

Right.

&gt; Cambodia’s population was not halved but more than doubled since 1970, despite alleged multiple genocides

Literal genocide denial!

&gt;Being a strong nationalist, Pol Pot was suspicious of the Vietnamese and Chinese minorities. But what he hated most was acquisitiveness, greed, the desire to own things.

He was racist, but it's okay since he didn't like greed!

&gt;The Cambodians I spoke to pooh-poohed the dreadful stories of Communist Holocaust as a western invention. They reminded me of what went on:  their brief history of troubles began in 1970, when the Americans chased away their legitimate ruler, Prince Sihanouk,  and replaced him with their proxy military dictator Lon Nol.

The use of the term ""pooh-poohed"". TIL communists support princes as legitimate rulers.

&gt;As for the mass killings, these are just horror stories, averred my Cambodian interlocutors.

More genocide denial.

&gt;To me, this recalled other CIA-sponsored stories of Red atrocities, be it Stalin’s Terror or the Ukrainian Holodomor.

""The Holodomor is just capitalist propaganda!"" ""Stalin did nothing wrong!""

&gt;They also supported the black legend of genocide to justify their own bloody intervention.

EVEN MORE genocide denial.

I don't think that's fair, he definitely draws a lot of comparisons between the classical liberal ""values"" and the aims of anarchism but I think it's more to make a point than anything.

Do you have some links to him being anti-communist? I know he doesn't like the USSR (I think we pretty much all agree with him on that here) but I heard him talk positively about left communists and council communists.

I'm pretty sure he never made apologies for the Khmer Rouge, he only questioned the validity of certain claims, explained how U.S. atrocities created the perfect conditions to their rise and compared the treatement of the genocide by the american media to the one in East-Timor that was commited by the U.S. backed Indonesia. 

At least, that's what I read in the two links I found. We should probably read his book on the subject, the one that caused the controversy.

&gt;The typical Stalino-Trotskyist position on the Spanish Civil War (read: the bourgeois position) is that Franco came to power because the anarchists refused to join the united front.

From what I read, it's because the stalinists undermined the anarchists (and the trotskyists) just to grab more power. Also, they didn't have many weapons and the USSR traded them for political influence and money, of course (how socialist of them).

You seem much more open than any other ""libertarian"" I saw on this forum. I reacted like that because we get at least one libertarian/capitalist a month that comes here and tells us how shit socialism is and it's a bit tiring. 

I'd also like to precise that socialism is not singlepayer healthcare or a ""bigger"" government, it's the abolition of capitalism and the public ownership (by that I mean controlled by the workers, not the government) of the means of production.

It already has. During the spanish revolution, the stalinists, who had gradually been taking power, decided to outlaw the POUM and started a big propaganda campaign calling them fascists-trotskyite saboteurs while members of the POUM were out on the front line fighting *real* fascists. Before that there was the Kronstadt rebellion that was violently repressed by the Red Army or the abolitions of the soviets by Lenin.

&gt; He was disillusioned with communism as a reaction to Stalinist policy (like George Orwell, with whom he had a bit of contact) and developed anti-authoritarian tendencies.

On a related note, what kept me from exploring socialism/communism when I was a social democrat was the image that all socialism is authoritarian. It's largely due to propaganda, obviously, but some socialists don't really help with this image when they talk about executing every person with dissenting opinions or making a drinking game out of executing ""bougie"" (i've seen that here).

http://libcom.org/library/albert-camus-anarchists

&gt;The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of tyranny a good conscience. It would be easy, however, to destroy that good conscience by shouting to them: if you want the happiness of the people, let them speak out and tell what kind of happiness they want and what kind they don't want! But, in truth, the very ones who make use of such alibis know they are lies; they leave to their intellectuals on duty the chore of believing in them and of proving that religion, patriotism, and justice need for their survival the sacrifice of freedom.

-Albert Camus, ""Homage to an Exile""

&gt;He expounds on this in ""The Rebel"", which was praised in the bourgeois press for being an anti-communist screed.

Just because he was praised for being anti-communist doesn't mean he shared the views of the bourgeois press. There is many crictism of the USSR to be made from the left. 1984 was anti-stalinist, but George Orwell was a socialist, even if the bourgeois propaganda system calls the book anti-communist.

&gt;opposing national liberation

You can oppose the kind of national liberation taking place without opposing national liberation. It's pointless to support a national liberation movement that aims to replace the bourgeois elite of the imperialist nation with the bourgeois elite of the nation trying to ""liberate"" itself. It's like supporting russian imperialism against american imperialism, they are both equally shit.

&gt;because ""oh the poor settlers might get hurt""

He was against killing civilians. ""Settlers"" and ""natives"" alike.

&gt;ignores their role in the absolutely brutal violence of colonialism

You realize the *Pieds-Noirs* were workers too, right? Indeed, some of them participated in the colonial regime, but that doesn't mean they were all guilty of oppression. Like I said in another comment, Albert Camus was born in a poor family and his father (who was an agricultural worker) was killed in WWI.",2015-11-08 02:17:18+00:00,cwsfv4x,4.0,t1_cwsdxw8,3453.0,socialism

His grand-father was french, his dad was born in Algeria and his mom was from Spain. He was born in Algeria. If the fact that one of his ancestors was a ""colonialist"" makes him a racist and imperialist, then you (assuming you live in north america), me and the hundreds of millions of people who live in North and South America are racists and imperialists.

You seem to think he was born in a rich colonialist family or something but he was really poor, his dad died in WWI when he was 8 months old so his mom worked as a maid to provide for him and his older brother. He was born in a ""proletarian"" family.

I said violence against civilians. Not just violence. At least quote the whole thing. I don't think bombing a bus full of people is a great technique for national liberation.

&gt;This liberal Camus would have preferred they ask the French Empire nicely.

&gt;
A: In short, a circlejerk.

Deuxième et troisième ligne de la FAQ. Ils le disent que c'est un circlejerk. Est-ce que tu prends /r/circlejerk au sérieux?

&gt;Turning the tables like this and watching reddit's reaction to us has been telling. It's important to understand that what we do here is satirical. We ridicule thoughtless, abusive and dehumanizing mindsets by reversing the position of privilege and parroting the standard defenses contrived to excuse them. Shitlords who have never dealt with prejudice -- and willfully ignore the views of those who have -- use justifications (Free speech impediment!/Just a joke!/White male discrimination!) that de-center and dismiss a complaint without ever having to acknowledge it.

Une autre quote de la FAQ. Est-ce que tu comprend? C'est juste pour faire chier le genre de monde qui fait des blagues raciste, et que quand une personne visée par la blague est offensée lui dise que c'est ""juste une joke"".

&gt;Je n'ai pas l'impression que l'utilisation de cette phrase est ironique. Il y a même une SJW qui se fait poursuivre en cours en angleterre pour incitation à la haine à cause de cela

&gt;This article in The Guardian explains why these statistics are bullshit. The solution the author proposes are liberal but the rest of the article is interesting nonetheless.

&gt;[""Exposing the great poverty reduction lie""](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/08/exposing-great-poverty-reductio-201481211590729809.html)

&gt;This article by the same author as the one before, shows how the world bank slightly changed it's definition of poverty to fit it's goal. Here's an interesting excerpt:

&gt;""But the IPL proved to be somewhat troublesome. Using this threshold, the World Bank announced in its 2000 annual report that ""the absolute number of those living on $1 per day or less continues to increase. The worldwide total rose from 1.2 billion in 1987 to 1.5 billion today and, if recent trends persist, will reach 1.9 billion by 2015."" This was alarming news, especially because it suggested that the free-market reforms imposed by the World Bank and the IMF on Global South countries during the 1980s and 1990s in the name of ""development"" were actually making things worse.

&gt;This amounted to a PR nightmare for the World Bank. Not long after the report was released, however, their story changed dramatically and they announced the exact opposite news: While poverty had been increasing steadily for some two centuries, they said, the introduction of free-market policies had actually reduced the number of impoverished people by 400 million between 1981 and 2001.

&gt;This new story was possible because the Bank shifted the IPL from the original $1.02 (at 1985 PPP) to $1.08 (at 1993 PPP), which, given inflation, was lower in real terms. With this tiny change - a flick of an economist's wrist - the world was magically getting better, and the Bank's PR problem was instantly averted. This new IPL is the one that the Millennium Campaign chose to adopt.

&gt;The IPL was changed a second time in 2008, to $1.25 (at 2005 PPP). And once again the story improved overnight. The $1.08 IPL made it seem as though the poverty headcount had been reduced by 316 million people between 1990 and 2005. But the new IPL - even lower than the last, in real terms - inflated the number to 437 million, creating the illusion that an additional 121 million souls had been ""saved"" from the jaws of debilitating poverty. Not surprisingly, the Millennium Campaign adopted the new IPL, which allowed it to claim yet further chimerical gains.""

&gt;The comments on the thread jerking each other off about how great the free market is are all fucking wrong. You can easily find statistics that shows the real effects of neoliberal policies and it's not pretty.

Edit: Also, 1$ a day, even if the reduction was real, isn't enough to live on. Here's another excerpt from the second article I linked above: 

&gt;According to Peter Edwards of Newcastle University, if people are to achieve normal life expectancy, they need roughly double the current IPL, or a minimum of $2.50 per day. But adopting this higher standard would seriously undermine the poverty reduction narrative. An IPL of $2.50 shows a poverty headcount of around 3.1 billion, almost triple what the World Bank and the Millennium Campaign would have us believe. It also shows that poverty is getting worse, not better, with nearly 353 million more people impoverished today than in 1981. With China taken out of the equation, that number shoots up to 852 million.

So that's 3.1 billion people (nearly half of the world's population) who are under an IPL (International Poverty Line) that would be actually enough to sustain people and the number is growing, not shrinking.",2015-09-22 22:24:17+00:00,cvappxn,1.0,t3_3lz5q1,9170.0,DebateAnarchism

2532,"&gt; To him, Free Trade is the normal condition of modern capitalist production. Only under Free Trade can the immense productive powers of steam, of electricity, of machinery, be full developed; and the quicker the pace of this development, the sooner and the more fully will be realized its inevitable results; society splits up into two classes, capitalists here, wage-laborers there; hereditary wealth on one side, hereditary poverty on the other; supply outstripping demand, the markets being unable to absorb the ever growing mass of the production of industry; an ever recurring cycle of prosperity, glut, crisis, panic, chronic depression, and gradual revival of trade, the harbinger not of permanent improvement but of renewed overproduction and crisis; in short, productive forces expanding to such a degree that they rebel, as against unbearable fetters, against the social institutions under which they are put in motion; the only possible solution: a social revolution, freeing the social productive forces from the fetters of an antiquated social order, and the actual producers, the great mass of the people, from wage slavery. And because Free Trade is the natural, the normal atmosphere for this historical evolution, the economic medium in which the conditions for the inevitable social revolution will be the soonest created -- for this reason, and for this alone, did Marx declare in favor of Free Trade.

2542,"&gt; Avram Noam Chomsky is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, logician, political commentator, social justice activist, and anarcho-syndicalist advocate.

He's no physicist.

&gt;That is, we're benefitting somebody.

Yes, the U.S. and a small wealthy elite in the country.

&gt;So you can't just argue that we're killing a bunch of foreign countries when there's really no standard as to who should be in power and nobody really has the right to stop us. Sure, you could argue we don't have the right to intervene, but the people in power would argue against you.

Fuck you.

&gt; Furthermore, your shitty Iraqi genocide link is from a site that promotes the idea that the American government did 9/11, which is ridiculous.

Poisining the well fallacy.

&gt;None of our interventions are ""genocide"".

Never said that, the U.S. backs states that commit genocides, though.

&gt;The president we overthrew? You know what he did? You overthrew someone else.

I'll cite the article I sent you, that you apparently did not read: ""*The immediate pretext for the military intervention was the country’s chronic political instability that had culminated in the overthrow, mob killing, and bloody dismemberment of President Jean Vilbrun Guillaume Sam.*"" He was already overthrown.

&gt;That's how the world works in some places. I'm sorry that not everyone can have democratic elections like us, but it's not our fault that they can't sort their own shit out.

No, that's not ""how the world works in some places"". Fuck off with your thinly veiled racism. Like I said before, and I provided many links to prove that, the U.S. doesn't let that happen. The systematic overthrow of every leftist government in South America during the 20th century attests of that. 

Today (well, yesterday, where I live) marks the 42th anniversary of the coup d'état, backed by the U.S., that brought Pinochet in power and killed Salvador Allende, a democratically elected marxist president. Don't tell me ""that's how the world works"" when we have proof in public records that the U.S. intervened and keeps intervening in almost every country around the globe. 

&gt;Look, the bottom line is foreign intervention not only benefits the United States, but many times can benefit the world through increased stability, allow us to have outposts in otherwise hostile regions, and can benefit the people of that area.

It was certainly beneficial to the [1 millions members of the Indonesian communist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366) who were massacred by the U.S. backed government of Sukarno or the [Indonesian invasion of East Timor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor), where one third of East Timor's population was wiped out or even the [13 000 arabs](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/07/israel-demolish-arab-buildings-west-bank-un-palestinian) who live in home that aren't guaranteed to be there the next day. Do you want other example of stability and benefits to the populations devastated by U.S. imperialism and it's right-wing military dictatorships?

&gt;We're not obligated to help everyone. However, we have, as a nation, extended our reach (all within our rights) to protect our interests and our citizens, as well as the citizens of our allies.

So an american citizen's life is more important than, for example, an indonesian citizen's life? Some people are worth more than others, only because of where they're born, that's what you're saying? Because for a country that calls itself the ""Champion of democracy and freedom"", that's kind of a conflicting statement.

&gt;Why do you hate America so much?

&gt; The world's governments first pledged to end extreme poverty during the World Food Summit in Rome in 1996. They committed to reducing the number of undernourished people by half before 2015, which, given the population at the time, meant slashing the poverty headcount by 836 million. Many critics claimed that this goal was inadequate given that, with the right redistributive policies, extreme poverty could be ended much more quickly.

&gt; But instead of making the goals more robust, global leaders surreptitiously diluted it. Yale professor and development watchdog Thomas Pogge points out that when the Millennium Declaration was signed, the goal was rewritten as ""Millennium Developmental Goal 1"" (MDG-1) and was altered to halve the proportion (as opposed to the absolute number) of the world's people living on less than a dollar a day. By shifting the focus to income levels and switching from absolute numbers to proportional ones, the target became much easier to achieve. Given the rate of population growth, the new goal was effectively reduced by 167 million. And that was just the beginning.

This article in The Guardian explains why these statistics are bullshit. The solution the author proposes are liberal but the rest of the article is interesting nonetheless.

[""Exposing the great poverty reduction lie""](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/08/exposing-great-poverty-reductio-201481211590729809.html)

This article by the same author as the one before, shows how the world bank slightly changed it's definition of poverty to fit it's goal. Here's an interesting excerpt:

&gt; But the IPL proved to be somewhat troublesome. Using this threshold, the World Bank announced in its 2000 annual report that ""the absolute number of those living on $1 per day or less continues to increase. The worldwide total rose from 1.2 billion in 1987 to 1.5 billion today and, if recent trends persist, will reach 1.9 billion by 2015."" This was alarming news, especially because it suggested that the free-market reforms imposed by the World Bank and the IMF on Global South countries during the 1980s and 1990s in the name of ""development"" were actually making things worse.

&gt; This amounted to a PR nightmare for the World Bank. Not long after the report was released, however, their story changed dramatically and they announced the exact opposite news: While poverty had been increasing steadily for some two centuries, they said, the introduction of free-market policies had actually reduced the number of impoverished people by 400 million between 1981 and 2001.

&gt; This new story was possible because the Bank shifted the IPL from the original $1.02 (at 1985 PPP) to $1.08 (at 1993 PPP), which, given inflation, was lower in real terms. With this tiny change - a flick of an economist's wrist - the world was magically getting better, and the Bank's PR problem was instantly averted. This new IPL is the one that the Millennium Campaign chose to adopt.

&gt; The IPL was changed a second time in 2008, to $1.25 (at 2005 PPP). And once again the story improved overnight. The $1.08 IPL made it seem as though the poverty headcount had been reduced by 316 million people between 1990 and 2005. But the new IPL - even lower than the last, in real terms - inflated the number to 437 million, creating the illusion that an additional 121 million souls had been ""saved"" from the jaws of debilitating poverty. Not surprisingly, the Millennium Campaign adopted the new IPL, which allowed it to claim yet further chimerical gains.

The comments on the thread jerking each other off about how great the free market is are all fucking wrong. You can easily find statistics that shows the real effects of neoliberal policies and it's not pretty.",2015-08-01 16:45:39+00:00,cto0omo,1.0,t3_3ff2jf,1543.0,socialism

2727,"I think the ""SJW"" movement points out real issues in our society, but some of them, like you said, divide the movement and separate people instead of uniting them against a cause, be it capitalism or other more specific issues. 

I think their (ours too) goal should be, instead of trying to ""hurt"" the privileges of white, able-bodied, cis, straight, mentally stable men, to try to elevate everyone to the level of privilege of the most privileged in our society. Isn't that what socialism is all about, getting rid of inequality?

I know that this is the goal of a big part of the movement but some people, who claim to be part of it too, seems to think contrary.

Edit: Wording
