As the museum so nicely demonstrates, it had to be done.

But tankies are hardly the alpha and omega of shitty leftism and it hardly seems fair to just pick on one group of pompous and self righteous asshats when there is a whole world of pseudo-socialists out there.

It makes sense, no one can build a 777 by himself, for example. If the division of labor is abolished, wouldn't that make any industry over the scale of small craft impossible? Is my definition wrong? 

While I'm talking about the division of labor, what exactly is the division between mental and physical labor? I know that some jobs are more physical and others more cerebral but in every one of them there's a bit of both. 

Sorry if those are basic questions but I haven't read much of the  ""economic"" side (Capital, Gotha Critique or Critique of Political economy, for example) of Marx and I didn't want to ask the Tank101 subs.

and checking (like the French *controle des billets*), and his emphasis
was on the prevention of sabotage and fraud by the capitalists. 

&gt;*My PDF has some weird glitches in the display of special characters, that's why the russian word is all messed up.*

The author then comes back many times to this distinction between the russian word Lenin uses and *real* control over the means of productions. If all this is true and correct, isn't that really important? If Lenin merely wanted worker oversight instead of worker ownership, it would change a lot of things.

It's the [garage guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZKp_jFxQJc&amp;feature=youtu.be) explaining how to read books! Reading books cover to cover is a myth, you only need to read the table of content, the first paragraph, some word in the middle and the last paragraph! 

I don't think it needs an explanation. It's fucking dumb and disrespects the book and the author.

I made the mistake of looking at the comments on /r/worldnews, it's disgusting down there, but less bad than after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. So called ""muslims"" saying it's the arabs nations fault, saying the colonisation of Algeria had nothing to do with radicalization and various bad history or just plain racism. There's also some dumbasses using it to push their ""free speech"" agenda in some twisted ways. At least some are telling people not to generalize to every muslims and etc.

What do you guys think about the causes of these attacks and the future consequences? Do you think western governments will, again, use these tragedies to increase surveillance on the general population? In a socialist country/world, what could we do to prevent this kind of radicalization? Do you think the consequences on Tunisia's economy will push more people towards radical Islam?

I looked into it a bit, the Kobo Aura looks pretty good and it's cheap.
