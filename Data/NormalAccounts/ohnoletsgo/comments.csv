4,"I'd agree.  For the most part, high fashion isn't necessarily meant to appeal to the layman, like you or I.  It's more intended to make a bold statement.  

Ultimately, though, design cues and technology used in these ""risk taking"" designs trickle down into more consumer-friendly versions.

For example, the Boost technology pioneered by the Yeezy line is one of the most comfortable shoe soles in production today.  The knit upper is also incredibly comfortable and breathable, making them great for running or everyday wear.",2016-11-06 22:18:45+00:00,d9oq11k,4.0,t1_d9oov61,1511.0,videos

6,"I agree, that colorway of the Air Jordan is pretty bland -- all black.  It's also relatively common too. 

Nike has put out some absolutely amazing colorways this year that combine classic design with cool backstories -- just check out the [OG Banned 2016](http://www.flightclub.com/air-jordan-1-retro-high-og-banned-2016-release-black-varsity-red-white-012496), which was apparently the same color combo that Michael Jordan originally wore in games, but was banned from wearing because the NBA was hesitant to adopt the new sneaker technology.  

Now that story is probably mostly hyperbole for marketing purposes, but damn if those shoes don't look good.

7,"From what I can tell, you're from Australia, which also has a thriving sneaker culture, you probably just don't realize it because it's more casual and Australian fashion tends to skew towards more towards subtlety and comfort. 

In the US, our sneaker culture is driven by flashiness and celebrity endorsement.  The most popular sneakers this year (by far) are the [Air Jordan 1](http://www.flightclub.com/air-jordans/air-jordan-1) (Nike, Michael Jordan celebrity endorsed fashion sneaker) and the [Yeezy](http://www.flightclub.com/adidas/yeezy) (Adidas, Kanye West celebrity endorsed fashion sneaker.) 

Both Nike and Adidas have done a fantastic job marketing these sneakers by releasing them in small batches and making them super exclusive.  

Everyone in Australia can probably go out today and get a pair of Adidas [Sambas](http://www.adidas.com/us/samba-classic-shoes/034563.html) (one of the most classic soccer sneaker designs in the world), but when there are only 10,000 or so Yeezy's made, it creates a huge market demand which Adidas then takes design cues from and trickles them down into more affordable and readily-available models ([NMD](http://www.flightclub.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=nmd), [Ultraboost](http://www.flightclub.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=ultraboost)), which come in a huge amount of colorways (different color combinations) and limited edition designs.

The net result is that there's a huge thriving resale market here in the US. -- i.e. new sneaker is released in a small batch, they sell out almost immediately and are resold with a markup to the MSRP.

So to answer your question, it's a popular item that people with expendable income decide to spend money on because they're a fashion item and status symbol.  Unless you're a complete basement shut-in autist, I'm sure there's something you spend your expendable income on -- computer components, anime videos, whatever.

29,"Two paths in startups:  success, funding, IPO or stagnation and failure.  Just do your due diligence prior to joining.  Is this a product or service you could potentially stand behind?  Would you use it yourself, or see the value within the market?  Are they offering a competitive package with equity?  If not, steer clear.  

Also, one of the best pieces of advice I got before interviewing:  the interview is a two-way street.  They need you as much as you need them.  Ask to speak to current employees, but also seek them out independently via Linkedin.  High turnover or refusal on their part is a huge red flag.  Read Glassdoor reviews and challenge your hiring manager if there are negative reviews.  Investigate company financials and recent news.

Note, this is much more effective if you're more established in your career and in higher demand, but is an excellent exercise for younger jobseekers as well.  

Like many people, I shoveled shit for a few years in a few questionable companies before finding my true path.

33,"Most wing places have bowls for each of their sauces so they do not co-mingle. This is so you don't accidentally mix your hottest sauce with your mild sauce and accidentally dose an unsuspecting patron with a super hot wing. 

That being said, you usually can't mix sauces unless the wing place specifically states you can (Taco Mac for example will give you a side of another sauce, but won't mix them. Too much cleaning involved to maintain speed and efficiency.)

Lemon Pepper wings are a dry rub which is applied much the same as wing sauce -- i.e. tossed in a bowl with seasoning. While they're effing delicious, they also don't have much kick, so people will often combine lemon pepper (dry rub) and one of the hot sauces (wet) for an amazing combo.

ET is who'd I'd recommend a company sending 5M email a month to. Mostly consumer marketing. 

Edit: so the story is that ET bought Pardot prior to the acquisition by SFDC. None are integrated, but ET skews towards they B2C business and Pardot on B2B. Can be a confusing sales process.

117,"So, here's the breakdown:

Hubspot:  Strong for inbound and generating leads and primarily inbound focused.  Tends to be best for very small organizations and doesn't scale well to mid-size or enterprise.  Cheap.  Also they've been investing more and more into their CRM business, so be aware that may be the direction they're tending.

Eloqua:  Was fine 8 years ago, but I've heard that it's a nightmare after the acquisition by Oracle.  Lots of need for technical resources and not user-friendly.  I'd avoid for now unless you're a large enterprise with lots of IT resources to help.  Mainly focused on driving middle of the funnel nurturing and outbound.

Pardot:  Hasn't gotten a ton of love from Salesforce after the acquisition by SFDC.  Does inbound and outbound, but most of the focus is on drip campaigns and email.  Demo's very well, but salespeople hate Lead Deck and it's not as easy-to-use as you think.  Not amateurish, but I'd expect to re-invest in 1-2 years.  Expect them to throw in an Exact Target rep too if you're just focused on email.

Marketo:  Good mix of top-of-funnel (inbound), middle-of-funnel (nurturing/outbound) and bottom-of-funnel (sales).  Consider this if you're an SFDC or Dynamics shop as they have the tightest integration I've seen out of the four.  Skews towards mid-size and enterprise, but has decent pricing for small biz too -- they'll get aggressive to beat Pardot.",2016-02-12 17:41:43+00:00,czxipno,3.0,t1_czxhwjt,1118.0,sales
