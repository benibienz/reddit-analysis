I was powering up my 1762 poliwrath and upon doing so went back to see where he was now ranking on the CP scale.

I was shocked to discover that while I was powering poly there had been a massive change in my pokemons ranks !

My entire top 4 levels had a massive revamp, my exegg went from 2040 and #1 in CP to 2075 and position #3, my two top Vaporeons jumped from 2020 and 1989 to positions #1 &amp; #2 at 2289 and 2269 CP.

A 100% rhydon I caught in the wild recently at 1472 jumped all the way to #4 position and now has 1925 CP and Snorlax bounced from 1820 and #7 position to 1899 and #5 position.

Poly jumped to 1816 cp, however is now behind an arcanine that I am not sure where it came from.

11,"&gt; I assume you're talking about people with disabilities? if you can get out of the house and into a car, surely you can go outside and stroll around in your wheelchair, scooter mobile, or whatever it is you/they use to get around and play like usual?

I can still walk , but only for short distances and even surfaces and with something to help steady me, operating vehicles is no prob.

My major hurtle is I live on a farm near a small town in the rural midwest.

Pokestops are far and few between, those that are easily accessible after a drive by yours truly amount to 4 in a twenty mile radius.

The remaining fifteen are either a lengthy walk after parking, a short walk across rough terrain, or for various reasons only accessible from a hwy or roadway.

Unless you consider slowing to a crawl or parking on a busy hwy/rdway safe, this speed reduction has made those particular pokestops a hazard for all to utilise.

Several of those roadway accessible stops were my choice hits as I went about my daily tasks and deliveries.

The only way I can now use them is by waiting till late in the evening or early in the morning when traffic has died down and I can time my niantic induced speed reduction accordingly.

What is a real pisser is all the damn prime spots for pokestops are not so marked utilised and due to niantics refusal to listen to its players/trainers designating these historical markers and points of interest as pokestops is currently unavailable.

For instance one of the more interesting, [and comical](https://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/1997/01/war-was-never-so-sweet), battles to take place in the U.S. is duly marked by a marker not far from where I live, but no pokestop.

A 5 mile long walking trail that parallels a nearby scenic drive with several historical markers has ZERO Pstops.

The historical dedication site/park historical monument for this states largest body of recreational waters,,, no Pstop.

There are several other historical monuments and markers as well as interesting sculptures and museums in this area all handicapped accessible , and not a one of them has a Pstop.

But the giant adirondack chair sitting in front of the local laser tag business that is only accessible from the busy hwy, or parking then jumping a chain link fence and walking close enough to open it does.

So do two local water towers surrounded by locked chain link fences, if you park along or on the busy streets that is.

Oh and I about forgot the one near the sports center sign along the hwy near the edge of town,, again accessible only by slowing to a 'niantic crawl' or parking on or along the busy hwy.",2016-11-17 10:58:35+00:00,da41tcl,4.0,t1_da3zqup,7271.0,pokemongo

What really surprised me was when I discovered one day that they had all somehow linked up with my Sony laptop from work and copied some of its programs as well, WTF ?

I now believe this may have happened through a shared wifi system  and passwords.

Another thing that is a bit freaky is I bought a sony flat screen for my home a few years back and later acquired a Sony Blue Ray DVD player to hook up to it.

Upon doing so and turning on the telly I was surprised to discover the TV announcing, ""A sony Blue Ray player has been detected, do you want to automatically install it into this system"" ?

At the time I thought, hey, that's pretty cool , and replied yes and it did so in short order, no muss no fuss.

A bit later I bought a Sony surround sound system and hooked it up to the TV and B-ray player.

This time when I turned on the TV I was expecting the auto hookup screen,,, however what it now said was rather disturbing.

Any thought otherwise is delusional, PERIOD !

Now lets look at those two VIABLE candidates, one is a well known lying conniving crooked old crone who will stop at nothing to gain power and wealth, no matter who or what it may hurt or destroy while doing so.

The other is a wealthy businessman with a big mouth, ego and a gung ho attitude who is willing to take the fight to the enemy no matter how bad it may get.

One cares for this nation, and the other considers it nothing but fodder for her to use in quest for power and wealth.

We may not like Donald Trump, however with his willingness to take on our enemies at their own level, and his proven track record for not giving a damn if he gets dirty while doing so, he may be just that right person at the right time this nation desperately needs right now.

I agree with that, however I also am open minded enough to realise that Trump beat every one of them at their own game and did so playing by the rules.

I honestly thought he was a goner when he made several mistakes and failed to understand the rules concerning delegates, however he recovered from it and bulldozed onward and upward despite everything his opponents were throwing at him.

Yeah, I was pissed, just as you were when Ted Cruz finally had to throw in the towel, however after the anger wore down, and the convention came to an end with no gopE uprising, I realised Trump was our duly elected candidate for the GOP.

By default that makes him the only viable contender against horrid hillary clinton.

I may not like the guy, and I wish it was Ted Cruz instead, however I have to give the Donald credit where its due, he bellied up to the table, played the right cards when it counted, and trash talked his opponents into making bad moves on their part.

480,"&gt; The Alt-Right is a small lunatic fringe of Trump supporters. They are the actual racists that the left uses to try to smear everyone else.

Who smears the left for their blatant racism ?

Again no I do not have to reject anyone because someone says I do.

And no just because I support their efforts against the left does not make me a racist because the left or you says it does.

I attended a tea party rally in a town not far from where I live, there were several people in Confederate uniforms ( one was a friend they are all reenactment nuts ) with battle flags and full dress gear.

Does that mean tea partiers are racist and so am I because I support them ?
Hell, now simply displaying a gadsden flag is supposed to be racist, and I have them all over the place and on my vehicles.

Does that make me a racist ?

I disagree with the catholic diocese that does make me an atheist ?

We support our troops that unfortunately do some awful things now and then, does that mean we are guilty of those crimes as well ?

I have met several military people with racist views far worse than any I have seen expressed by the alt-right, does that mean I should not support our troops ?

Do you get my point ?

From what I have come to understand it is a movement that is steadily gaining strength, it's internet savvy and the voice and influence that gives it is what is scaring the hell out of the left.

Things like this do not grow or influence people unless there is something going on to give them a reason to listen or seek it out.

There is a void in our culture just waiting to be filled, and this could be one of those things that fills it.

Ironically it is the left who created that very void with their anti religion ( christian ) agenda, and protected species victimhood ideology.

As I have said many times, political correctness ideology through no part of my own other than being who I am has made me enemy #1 because I am caucasian, own firearm's and several vehicles they have labeled as offensive and a lifestyle they have blamed all the worlds problems on, plus I do not buy the bullshit they are selling.

With (hip/mainstream) society making them an outsider there are a lot of young people looking for something to be a part of, and this is something that they find appealing. 

This is why I believe we should not be so fast to diss this movement, by doing so we risk turning them away and right into the hands of the left which is more than happy to accept them if they can be twisted to lean their way.

&gt;The real fight is the fight to save conservatism from the Alt-Right and to make sure the next presidential race is a choice between conservatism and liberalism instead of a choice between big government liberalism and big government nationalism.

Conservatism has already lost out to immoral ideologies like gay marriage, drugs, out of control big business and illegal immigration and even political correctness !

That last being expressed by those of you condemning others just because they don't fit precisely into the PC tolerable mold.

I know I don't fit that mold, so apparently like Reagan said about the democrat's, he didn't leave the party, the party left him.

729,"Saw this happen with several larger fish one year on the farm.

We had an 8 foot diameter metal stock tank for the Cattle that had 4 large carp, and two 3lb black bass and several crappies in it that I had caught during the summer.

The tank was filled from a freeze proof hydrant which it was placed next to for just that purpose and heated by a propane stock tank heater hooked to a 100lb propane tank.

This particular year, sometime in the late 70's a heavy wind driven snow made it impossible to get to the stock tank and service the fuel tank or check the water level for around two weeks or more.

The cattle were unable to reach the tank as well, so we had to set them up a water system in the barn which was filled by buckets on a daily basis.

After several days of sub zero temps the weather finally settled down and I was able to make the journey to the stock tank with a John Deere tractor cutting a path for the cattle as I did so.

As expected the stock tanks water was frozen solid due to the heater having ran out of fuel only God knows when.

I changed fuel tanks and fired the heater back up to thaw the solid mass of ice, I could see the fish frozen in place in the solid block suspended where they had been when it froze around them.

I knew it would be several hours before the tank thawed, and I could clean them out before they contaminated the tank so I left and went back to the house planning on returning later that evening.

It was actually the next morning before I was able to return, I found the water ice free, and to my amazement all the fish were swimming about in the tank as if nothing had happened !

""The common enemy of humanity is man.
In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up 
with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, 
water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these
dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through
changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.
The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""
- Club of Rome, 
premier environmental think-tank,
consultants to the United Nations



""We need to get some broad based support,
to capture the public's imagination...
So we have to offer up scary scenarios,
make simplified, dramatic statements
and make little mention of any doubts...
Each of us has to decide what the right balance
is between being effective and being honest.""
- Prof. Stephen Schneider, 
Stanford Professor of Climatology,
lead author of many IPCC reports

""Democracy is not a panacea. It cannot organize everything and
it is unaware of its own limits. These facts must be faced squarely.
Sacrilegious though this may sound, democracy is no longer well 
suited for the tasks ahead. The complexity and the technical nature 
of many of today’s problems do not always allow elected 
representatives to make competent decisions at the right time.""

""In my view, after fifty years of service in the United Nations system,
I perceive the utmost urgency and absolute necessity for proper
Earth government. There is no shadow of a doubt that the present

""Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound
reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world

Nopes, your side lost this argument for you long ago.

Case in point, I posted an article about black teens attacking two white teen girls taking care of a white baby.

I caught holy hell from the tard community because the articles headline claimed they were white girls when they were in fact half black and half white.

The two girls that were attacked looked white, and the blonde haired baby was obviously white, however the tard community adamantly insisted there was no wrong done because they were really BLACK.

Which doesn't make sense when the same tard community tells us a guy who thinks he's a woman can be whatever he wants, or vice versa, however a person who calls themself white because they look and identify with whites is not allowed equal right to do so if they have an iota of black blood flowing through their veins.

Notice I said leader, not President.

I know this will not set well with many on here, however I have long thought of FDR as being a great leader, yes I do not agree with a lot of his policies and legislations he enacted, however its hard to argue that he was not the right guy at the right time.

Ronald Reagan was another perfect example of a great leader, and President in my opinion.

Like FDR he took his office to the people, he was always on the spot reassuring us during times of disaster, and always reassuring us we had nothing to fear during times of turmoil.

Unlike FDR and Reagan obama is always last to address the people, and when he does its begrudgingly with no feeling and absolutely no reassurance PERIOD !

Hill the horrid exhumes the same ill feelings, and we all know she is a damn malicious liar from the get go.

Trump on the other hand, despite all his faults, has no problem taking it to the people, in fact he actually appears to enjoy doing so, and often in so doing he says things some dont want to hear and others dont like, but unlike his politically trained opponents he says what he thinks, not some scripted speech he doesnt believe a word of and has no intentions of following.

As he has demonstrated here with this trip to Louisiana, he knows how important it is to those people that someone give help and hope when there does not seem to be any.
Obviously there is not much he can do, however that feeling of hope, and the attention his being there is sure to bring is often more than enough.",2016-08-19 13:58:24+00:00,d6o1evw,1.0,t3_4yhl37,23194.0,Conservative

On busy Friday and Saturday evenings however I have observed a drastic increase in spawning rate and the spawning of far more interesting Pokemon.

The only difference being there are obviously many people playing.

That combined with the fact that NASA is currently engaged in a directive given them by obama to undertake improving relations with the islamic people.

That is when I fully realised NASA like thousands of other government controlled organizations is forced to follow the will and whim of its political masters if it has any hope of receiving a portion of the taxpayers money.

When the political masters say jump, nasa asks how high, how far and where ?

I live in rural america, the majority of the terrain in this area is either farmed agriculture, peoples yards, woods, or hiking trails.

With the exception of three 'Pokestops' located on the closest towns courthouse lawn ( A Patriotic painted rock, Civil war statue, and the courthouse itself ) all other pokestops are spread a minimum of a mile apart, and are close enough to the streets where a person driving by at the posted speed limit of 30 or 25 MPH can open them and rake in the booty ( I know this because I do so every day while making my rounds, I have constructed a special holder for my cell and it is as simple as a glance, poke and swipe ).

I catch most of my pokemon by parking on the town square and firing up lures in the two closest pokestops.

Other than that I have discovered my best bets are 'cruising' the Mc D's or Wally World parking lot snagging as many pokemon as possible in a small area than grabbing a parking spot and hopefully bagging them before they escape.

Otherwise driving sub 20mph around the towns residential area pops up an occasional prize pok'e critter ( so far the middle aged guy driving slowly through the hoods has not raised any unwanted attention, I try and mingle with the garage sale shoppers).

At this point in my life a wheel chair would be a very big hassle, especially loading and unloading into my vehicle.
For some it would be a burdensome cost, and might even incur greater expense to acquire a vehicle capable of transporting the necessary equipment to go sidewalk level mobile.

The only ones in denial about ""climate change' are the idiots stupid enough to think the current warming trend is unprecedented , caused by human activity and is dangerous because a political ideology told them so.

The chicken little cult that has been ( deliberately ) built around the UNPROVEN mythology of MAN MADE CLIMATE CHANGE is nothing more than a political agenda using quasi science as a tool to achieve its goals.

Its founders clearly stated their intents, and openly stated their goals, anyone with an open mind could see right through their smoke and mirrors bullshit they have concocted to cover their evil intentions should they simply take the time to look .

""The common enemy of humanity is man.
In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up 
with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, 
water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these
dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through
changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.
The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""
- Club of Rome,

""Today American's would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow they will be grateful. This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government.""

-Henry Kissinger in an address to the Bilderberg Organization meeting at Evian, France, May 21, 1992

I have yet to read where Trump has condemned Ted and his speech, I may have missed it, but I have yet to see anything claiming so.

In fact I commend The Donald for inviting Ted to speak, in this guys opinion that took as big a balls as did Ted to stick by his laurels, beliefs and ideology.

The Donald took a big step towards uniting the party by inviting Ted to speak unrestrained and with no requirement for a public endorsement.

The only reason there is even an issue is because the new york rino delegates demanded an endorsement, and of course the msm is damn determined to play that to the max.

Ted gave a great Speech, and fully supported the GOP ticket as he stated from top to bottom.

A very very bad choice of wording in my opinion, by doing so he has designated his own officers who use 'sniper' tactics to being ""cowards"".

The blm 'snipers' could be called lots of things, however cowards would not be one I would bestow upon them.

Unlike their police officer or military counterparts the blm snipers knew that as soon as they even aimed their weapons at an officer, even without pulling the trigger they were bringing a world of shit down on them, and by pulling that trigger they guaranteed themselves at best a life behind bars and more than likely a one way ticket to hell in the very near future.

Call them terrorists, murderers, killers or something along that line, but not cowards, because by doing so you only garner your own 'snipers' with the same epithet and add fuel to the fire that you have to put out.

Actually the islamic terror connection to this nations existence reaches back even further than that.

Keep in mind that this nation eventually came into existence because one Spanish explorer named Columbus was searching for an alternate route to the east so as to bypass the territories that were under control of a hostile islamic empire that had strangled all trade with the 'East' at the time.

As the muslims claim to believe, 'nothing happens that is not the will of allah'.

This is a typical case of people looking for a reason to be offended finding one everywhere they look.

Believe it or not I personally ran into pretty much the same issue several years ago while helping out on a damn Christmas lights display.

I was recruited ( unwillingly I might add ) to make a ""star"" that would have lights installed on it to be hoisted to the top of a tower for a christmas light competition.

I was given the task with no instructions beyond 'we need a star'.

So I set to work figuring out how to make one that would be large, lite and durable enough to do the job, I decided to make it out of a sheet of half inch plywood.

Then I discovered that drawing out a star is not as simple as it sounds, first off, I am a Dallas Cowboy fan so that was the initial inspiration for my desired star.
Second I am no artist, that being the case, try drawing a five pointed star and see what an abomination you come up with.

Upon experimentation I discovered two triangles mirrored then overlapped made a very nice looking and well balanced star, and who cares how many points a star has as long as they look nice right ? 

Upon completion I was prety proud of my star, as were the peeps who gave me the task of producing it, after painting and installing the lights, then hoisting it to the top of the tower then powering it up everyone agreed it looked AWESOME !

You could see our star over a mile away as you drove down the nearby Highway.

A few days later, the comments started being heard about the ""jewish star"" in one display.

WTH people, grow up and get a life !

By the way our display won.

1096,"The cannon part of this article reminds me of an incident that took place here in my nearby 'hometown'.

On the courthouse lawn of our town square sat a civil war era cannon that had been filled with concrete long ago to prevent it being abused by ""miscreants"".

One such miscreant happened to notice late one evening while lounging around said cannon that the yearly expansion and contraction of the cannons barrel had slowly deteriorated the concrete slug to the point the cannon could be tipped forward, and the slug removed.

This observation set in motion a plan to have some late night fun with the old cannon.

The group of miscreants set their Sgt. of arms to work developing a proper caliber powder charge while the others fabricated a ramrod from a push broom handle, wood scraps, and duct tape.

An old towel was considered sufficient for the purposes of a wad, no projectile was intended, the miscreants were only interested in the bang and not destroying any hapless building in the old war guns set line of fire.

Three M80's were sacrificed for their fuses, and a welding rod and small hammer were to be used to clear the fuse vent.

Around 2 something in the morning the band of miscreants went to work, with lookouts in place the sgt. of arms and the primary conspirator and one other cohort walked up to the cannon, tipped it forward enough to slide the concrete plug to where it could be grabbed and pulled from the bore.

They then set to work loading the charge and prepping the fuse, all went surprisingly smooth and well, so they were done in less than a minute.

The fuse was inserted then lit and all ran like hell for cover.

Before they could all reach their designated observation points the cannon fired, and it was far far louder than any had expected it to be !

(Sgt. of arms later admitted he may have been a bit liberal with the modern gun powder.)

The loud report combined with the huge fire blast exiting the barrel lit up every building on the square for a brief moment and echoed across town for several seconds.

All perps involved fled the area like rats off of a sinking ship.

The next day the incident was reported on the local T.V and Radio news and in the town paper.

Because of the incident the cannon was removed from its long time perch on the square, and then later moved to a museum at the state capitol where it now resides forever silent.

Other than a new born child pretty much every person on Earth with the slightest knowledge of the existence of firearms is aware they have a loud report.

The fact is this leftist turd wrote this article with extreme hateful bias and ill intent against any person who would possess such a product and the Firearm itself.

He then way over dramatised the experience intending to instill further fear into the ignorant and in the process made a fool of himself in the eyes of the informed and experienced.

I have through the years encountered many people young and old who were apprehensive about firearms and even 'scared' of the 'menacing appearance' of my own .223 firing semi auto rifle.

Every single one of them when asked if they would like to fire it has taken me up on the offer, the thought of actually shooting something that looks as it does seems to have an attraction they find impossible to resist despite their claimed fear of such a device.

To date I have found a simple demonstration of its handling and operation with a warning about its loud report and slight kick, with a few shots fired by yours truly to familiarise them with its capabilities, they have all found themselves enjoying the experience and have appreciated the chance to fire such a weapon.",2016-06-19 16:21:17+00:00,d4fhe19,3.0,t1_d4fgda5,1864.0,gunpolitics

It's all due to the math.

Islamic terrorist have outnumbered Gays for centuries, one can import islamic terrorists far faster than gays could ever reproduce, greater population numbers means more voters, more voters means more scumbag democrats in political positions.

As a bonus there is the fact islamic terrorists hate Gays and consider it open season on them which by default would steadily eviscerate any potential 'loose' gay vote being up for grabs by a competing political ideology.

Advantage, islamic terrorist by far.

Being an ideology of absolutely no morals the left would obviously throw the gay community under the bus in a heartbeat for the far far larger potential of the islamic terrorist vote.

1402,"&gt; Did you think I would answer differently? It has no bearing on the point that I am making that there are crimes and terrorist attacks committed by Muslims in the name of Islam.

Many of the examples I pointed out to you are legal killings endorsed by the islamic controlled government/state !

Throwing gays off of roofs has almost become the national sport of islam !

Burning people in cages and dipping them in acid is now a daily event.

Stoning women to death for public exposure, disobeyance, or driving a car etc. is such a common experience in islamic nations it is considered just part of an average day in the hood.

All of the above are approved and condoned by the state under the guise of sharia law, the law of islam.

This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown.

Yet you have absolutely no problem ignoring the 'hard science' that conflicts with the political agenda driven bullshit you so blindly and devotedly believe.

Any and all 'science' connected to the global warming cult must first be funneled and filtered through the ipcc where it is judged kosher to the cause or thrown out because it is in conflict with their agenda.

Even that of your beloved NASA, a government operated organization that is controlled by the very same tax dollars allotted by politicians who herald the UN as the impending salvation of their socialist elitist cause.

I guess you missed out on the fact that NASA is currently engaged in a mission of islamic relations as mandated by obama himself ?

1638,"I was the direct witness to an uncannily similar acrobatic airshow 'accident'  of a rather famous pilot several years ago during an annual 'Fly In' at the local airport.

My family owned the land surrounding the municipal airport at the time and due to the fact my grandparents, father and myself were and are all pilots I have been commissioned to perform several maintenance duties on the airfield since I was old enough to operate the necessary equipment.

Because of the above I was a volunteer for the Fly in and had the task of directing attending aircraft to the closed grass runway for parking during their stay at the event.

I was stationed at the far end of the runway so as to stop the landing planes from making a U turn and taxying back down the main strip and onto the adjoining closed smaller antiquated asphalt strip to keep traffic flowing smoothly.

I had been their all morning directing traffic when the small red Pitts Special taxied up for takeoff, It was Glen Sigafoose a pilot I knew well because of his being the owner of SIG model aircraft company and his having attended many events locally.

He waved me over and informed me he was the beginning of the Airshow and I was supposed to head in during the show and take a break.

I had ridden my motorcycle to my assigned position so upon Glen's takeoff I walked to it and fired it up and began the journey to the hangars were the crowd was waiting for the show to begin.

As I rode down the asphalt runway which ran parallel to the new main Glen came out of a long dive following the main flashing by me and at the far end of the main began his climb, however upon rotating upward the plane faltered and quickly dipped down after crossing the end of the runway and the fence several hundred feet from its end then crashed into the ground in our cornfield !

Due to its momentum the Pitts took a bounce then cartwheeled through the tall corn before coming to and abrupt stop, due to the height of the corn at the time the small plane's remains could not be seen from ground level, and there was no fire or smoke to designate its position.

I quickly rode to the fence, parked my bike and jumped the fence and ran in the direction through the tall corn to where I had seen the plane end up.

I ran right to it and found the Pitts rolled into a ball, the open cockpit was well crushed, and Glen's body was secured in place by the belts.
I quickly ascertained by the damage to his upper body and head he was deceased, at about the same time I became aware someone was yelling my name so I left the crash scene and quickly returned for the fence where I found a local Highway Patrol officer who was a family friend and the airports manager.

They asked If I found the wreckage which I told them I did and informed them he had not survived, at that point the Patrol Officer jumped the fence and had me guide him to the aircraft.

He like myself quickly determined Glen had died upon impact, at that point we walked back to the fence where a crowd was quickly gathering, the Patrol Officer directed me to stand guard at the fence and direct the ambulance crew to the site, and to let no one else near it.

After the body was removed and the event quietly disbanded an FAA investigator flew in later that day and I directed him to the site as well.

Upon finishing his investigation and chatting with the Airport officers I was assigned the task of bringing in one of the farm tractors with a loader to pick up the plane and load it onto a hay wagon , then haul it to an empty hangar where it would stay until it was released by the investigators.

I was present during the planes teardown in case they needed help lifting it with the tractors loader.

During that ordeal the inspector discovered that the carbs float had snagged into a closed position which would cause fuel starvation, however he was not sure if it had been in that position prior or during the accident.

Luckily for us there were several other good contenders and one very strong bearer of the Conservative Torch to choose from, the latter being Ted Cruz of course.

Its the final lap at Talladega and carl edwards is in the lead with Jimmy Johnson hooked three car lengths behind in second place, the rest of the pack consisting of cars of various amount of laps down with the exception of brian vickers in 15th place who is desperately holding onto the lead lap.

Carl is the dream boy of NASCAR fans and the media, who constantly fawn all over him and grant him interviews at the wink of an eye, Jimmie is the proven racer, everyone knows nobody is a better driver than Jimmie and he has the record to prove it, vickers, he is there because he once raced for a winning team, he is not known to be a winner and this year has been no different for him.

Vickers only chance in hell is if the two leaders pull a crash and burn and take each other out of the race which is not all that impossible, this is Talladega after all.

Carl in his usual fashion is talking trash on the radio to the commentators telling them how good he is and how he has this race won.

Meanwhile Jimmie who has been a contender the whole damn race is working the wheel waiting for the slightest bobble from carl or the right moment to pull one of his fast moves and pass carl at the last moment.

Everyone knows you never count Jimmie out, if anyone knows how to win it is Jimmie Johnson.

If you haven't figured it out by now carl edwards is trump, Jimmie Johnson is obviously Ted Cruz and that damn vickers is kasich.

""No matter if the science of global warming is all phony...
climate change provides the greatest opportunity to
bring about justice and equality in the world.""
- Christine Stewart,
former Canadian Minister of the Environment

""If we don't overthrow capitalism, we don't have a chance of
saving the world ecologically. I think it is possible to have
an ecologically sound society under socialism. 
I don't think it is possible under capitalism"" 
- Judi Bari,
principal organiser of Earth First! 

""The only hope for the world is to make sure there is not another
United States. We can't let other countries have the same 
number of cars, the amount of industrialization, we have in the US. 
We have to stop these Third World countries right where they are.""
- Michael Oppenheimer,
Environmental Defense Fund

""The fate of mankind, as well as of religion, depends upon
the emergence of a new faith in the future. 
Armed with such a faith, we might find 
it possible to resanctify the earth.""

""The greatest hope for the Earth lies in religionists and 
scientists uniting to awaken the world to its near fatal predicament
and then leading mankind out of the bewildering maze of 
international crises into the future Utopia of humanist hope.""

""The earth is literally our mother, not only because we depend on
her for nurture and shelter but even more because the human
species has been shaped by her in the womb of evolution....

""It is the responsibility of each human being today to 
choose between the force of darkness and the force of light.
We must therefore transform our attitudes, and adopt a renewed
respect for the superior laws of Divine Nature.""
- Maurice Strong,
first Secretary General of UNEP

""Little by little a planetary prayer book is
thus being composed by an increasingly united
humanity seeking its oneness. Once again,
but this time on a universal scale, humankind is
seeking no less than its reunion with 'divine,'
its transcendence into higher forms of life. Hindus
call our earth Brahma, or God, for they rightly
see no difference between our earth and the divine.
This ancient simple truth is slowly dawning again upon
humanity, as we are about to enter our cosmic age
and become what we were always meant to be:
the planet of god.""

[About the IPCC](https://www.searchlock.com/search?q=the+truth+about+the+ipcc)


The inconvenient truth is that anything and everything you see related to global warming and its cult following is filtered directly through the ipcc.

Nothing , and I mean absolutely nothing you are presented about the climate change issue is deemed kosher unless they have said it to be.

1773,"&gt;What a couple of nerds am I right

Actually their story is pretty interesting, from what I have been told the oldest started riding an old indian to deliver mail during the early 20's when still a teenager.
While doing so he ran into some interesting fellas who asked if he would be interested in making some 'real money'.

It seems there were people who hung out in a town nearby with a reputation for being on the wild side who needed to have messages delivered for them because they didn't like using telephones.

And having used motorcycle couriers where they lived while not on the lam they were looking for some local bikers who might be interested in a 'little work'.

Being as it was the depression and my Great Uncle being the oldest son in a family with seven siblings this was an opportunity he could not pass up.

That being the case he found himself delivering the mail, and picking up a message now and then with special instructions on where to meet the recipient, most of his drop offs were in the Ottumwa Iowa area, however he did make a few trips to Burlington as well.

However the ones he really liked were the ones that sent him all the way to the 'Windy City' Chicago, they payed the big bucks.

On those special occasions his younger brother would ride along and help with the 'driving' if he got to tired.

Now bear in mind back in those days there was no pillion for a rider, just a fender, very little suspension and no interstate, PERIOD !

They strapped a bundle of gunny sacks wrapped in rawhide to the rear fender and that was the seat for the rider, God forbid you lost your footing of got your pants leg caught in the exposed chain.

They used a length of rope to tie on incase the rider fell asleep !

A trip to Chicago from here is no small deal on modern bikes, I can only imagine what it was like with those conditions on one of those old hardtails.

Like I said my Great Uncles were some real bad asses, those two later ended up in WWII, one in the Pacific Front and the other the European, he was one of the people who charged the beaches of Normandy on D-day and lived to tell about it.

A Chicago trip payed $150.00, at that time that was almost a years wages at a good paying job.

It was with the money they made running 'messages' that they bought the two new 36 knuckles in the pic, who they were working for with their side job was never told to them, and they didn't ask.

An interesting side note:

Ten years ago my Gal and I were visiting Chicago and checking out the sites, while taking in the Museum of Science and Industry and touring the Automotive display we came across a display of an early Twenties Indian Motorcycle with the background of of a blacktop roadway and a crossroad sign which read Chicago ILL. 10, Mystic Ia. 365.

I was amazed, what the hell was a podunk town like Mystic doing on a display in a museum in Chicago ?

I was so curious about it that I found an employee of the museum who contacted someone else on his radio, he then told me the lady responsible for the display would come down and tell me the story herself if I was willing to wait, and I was.

Upon introducing herself she told me she was born and raised in Mystic, and we had a little Iowa reunion of course, then she told me the story behind the display.

The display was part of the museums Crossroads Theme, and this particular display was about the prohibition era and its influences on Chicago and thereby the upper midwest.

She then told me that her family owned a property in Mystic that was often used by some of the Chicago 'Big Wigs' avoiding the prohibition laws and just law in general.

Those 'Big Wigs' would never use a phone due to the fear of the law listening in so they hired motorcycle couriers to deliver messages for them.

She said they used motorcycle couriers because they were faster than the cars of the time and could easily outrun and hide from the law if necessary ensuring the messages always got through.

Plus the riders were alway young daring characters in need of making some money.

When I told her about my Great Uncles she was excited, she wanted to know If I would be willing to send her the pic and allow her to make a copy of it, I would so she took my name, address and phone number.

When she returned the pic she told me it and the story I relayed to her about the two men on and their adventures were now on a plaque in the display with the old indian motorcycle.

She also wrote a story about meeting me and my Lady Friend for the local paper, which also carried the infamous pic of the two scoundrels.

Saddly both of them had passed on in the 90's, however I sent copies of everything to their families letting them know their legend lived on.",2016-04-13 01:21:18+00:00,d20lsl3,8.0,t1_d20jfhi,3751.0,Conservative

""Today American's would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow they will be grateful. This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government.""

That being said at that point a simple apology, or explanation as to why he felt the action was necessary should have and all indications are would have sufficed and that would have been the end of it.

However the creep and his so called boss instead of being decent people decided to take the low road and began a smear campaign and outright malicious lying to demonise and intimidate this young lady and the eyewitness who saw the whole incident unfold before his very eyes.

Whats ironic is to hear trump whine about people insisting he fire the ceep after the vid made it obvious he was flat out lying by claiming he could never do anything like that, to trash a mans life for such a small incident.

Yet the toupeed manure spreader had absolutely no problem trashing the victim and the eyewitness's lives and reputations along with encouraging his rabid braindead zomboid followers to intimidate them.

Obviously


&gt;He said he never touched her or knew who she was.

He did claim he did not know who she was, however he outright lied when he claimed he never touched her, the fact is he initially did state he 'did manhandle her'.


&gt; How do we know he knew who Michelle Fields was if in his mind he never tried to throw anyone to the ground and then hears about this person? He may have thought, ""I never did anything like that. Who is this person?"" You know, just using your same logic there.

Oh he knew what was being referred to shortly after the incident, he even went so far as to say he would contact her and apologise for the incident which he never did and which caused her boss to insist she report the incident to the police.

Keep in mind that her direct boss who insisted she file a police report also resigned because of this incident because of the reaction breitbart had to it and towards her.

It is when it conflicts with the truth and what the person at issue is stating.

Do not forget, there was an eye witness to this ordeal directly behind her and the creep that saw the whole thing happen.

In fact from the first reports of the incident she was so shocked by what happened she did not even know who did it until the AP photographer who was the witness told her.

In the police vid he can be seen directly behind her in a plaid shirt looking directly at the ordeal taking place in front of him.

""Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound
reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world
has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both
governments and individuals and an unprecedented
redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift
will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences
of every human action be integrated into individual and
collective decision-making at every level.""

""Today American's would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow they will be grateful. This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government.""

Yet malicious liar trump and his creepy cronie sure have no problem trashing innocent hard working peoples lives when it comes to covering their asses.

She was working for a trump friendly news service, they knew who she was, and even stated that she supported trump as her second choice for President.

However lowanddumbscum and his enabler the great pumpkin apparently incapable of being decent human beings and proven malicious liars instead go on a campaign of personal destruction and false accusations directed at this woman, why ?

Their response from the start makes absolutely no sense, why demonise this young lady instead of demonstrating at least a little bit of decency ?

I am coming to believe lying malicious trump is incapable of being decent, and like hitler he surrounds himself with goose stepping extremists just like himself.

Now that this vid has been released and this issue has returned to bite malicious lying trump and his creepy cronie in the ass instead of humbling down and malicious lying trump saying he was simply standing by his creepy cronie and said cronie giving an apology, they turn up the attack on the victim.

There is no pic or vid that shows the cowardly lying cronie holding her upper arm as the the mindless trump minions are claiming.

What amazes me is what kind of people after having it clearly proven to them that malicuous liar trump and cowardly abusive liar lowandumbski have been lying all along about this ordeal now defend them and accuse an innocent victim who's story has been vindicated by incontrovertible proof of lying !

2099,"&gt;  I was just pointing out that the GOP has a history of screwing candidates, and this would screw Trump.

How would it ""screw"" trump ?

If he does not have the delegates going into the convention to win outright he will have to face the scrutiny of the appointed delegates at the convention.

AS PER THE RULES that have been longstanding and well known for years.

Ron Paul was working with the same plan that Cruz and others are, however by the time the convention rolled around it was pretty much game over.

The only one attempting to do anything wrong here is trump, he wants to change the rules at half time to his benefit.

Unfortunately for him life outside his gilded tower does not work by his rules.",2016-03-28 21:17:14+00:00,d1gudq4,10.0,t1_d1gu2ie,432.0,conservatives
2100,"&gt; Yeah, he got screwed. They changed the rules specifically to get around him.

I believe you are not understanding what I am saying.

Even though Paul did not win Iowa, his people here held the majority of the appointed delegate seats headed to the Convention.

His team worked the same strategy here in Iowa that Ted Cruz's has  
in Louisiana and elsewhere.

If you think I am dissing Dr. Paul you are horribly wrong, I supported him during the Caucuses and up to the point he bowed out of the race.

He had strong support In Iowa in 2012 and finished surprisingly well, unfortunately he did not have the money backing him romney and santorum did.

If I remember correctly Dr. Paul and his supporters captured several state delegate positions in other states as well, just as Ted Cruz has.",2016-03-28 21:07:06+00:00,d1gtxxf,8.0,t1_d1gtj4m,551.0,conservatives

2102,"&gt; But it should be, and if the shoe were the other way around, conservatives would be screaming.

Pretty much the same thing was done by Ron Paul's campaign organisation here in Iowa during the 2012 elections.

Sure there were sore losers like trump crying foul, and even the GOPe didnt like it, but they did nothing against the rules, and those rules remain the same to this day.

Listening to trump now whine because he failed to read the rules so he now demands they be changed to fit his narrative and make him the winner reminds me of another loser who tried doing the same in Florida during the 2000 election.

I used to be a trump supporter, I believe even chab would attest to that, I am the person who posted the first Diamond &amp; Silk vid that went viral many months ago to this forum.

However I also live in Iowa, that being the case we have a long drawn out opportunity to get to know the candidates well, in some cases to well.

That was the case with trump, the more I heard from him, and read about him, the l more I became disenchanted with him and his 'ideology' what ever that may be, it seems to change on a minute by minute basis.

I am not a person who gets suckered in by razzle dazzle and bullshit, which is why I never was a global warming cult blind believer also.

Having come to see trump for what he wasn't I took a look at the other candidates, I rather like Carson, but he was just not leadership material.

Fiorina sounded good at first, however she had to many faults, jeb, christie, kasich, santorum, walker, and huck etc. etc. never had a chance.

Rubio had the immigration baggage dragging along behind him.

Then Ted Cruz started showing up in the state appearing on local talk radio and even in the news when he made his historic speech before the senate.

I dug for info on him, and found few flaws, and what many may have considered flaws ( unwavering stance for the Constitution and refusing to bow to the left ) were badges of honor in my opinion.

So your right I am A cruz supporter, and one who has become so with research on the candidate not school girl admiration for bullshit rhetoric and lies like trump spews on a daily basis.

2319,"People think your nuts when you talk about ""agenda 21"", however let me warn you, it is very real.

I never even heard of it until I found myself in a very real and expensive fight in court with its forces.

To make a long story short, Upon returning back to Iowa from Texas I undertook a clean up operation on the railroad right of way that cut a swath across our various family properties.

When the Rock Island railway abandoned the right of way the SCOTUS in a landmark decision retuned ownership to the adjoining landowners affected by the granted right of way.

During My hiatus in Texas the local municipal airport had extended its runway, and in so doing it caused a dam between the end of the runway and the railroad right of way.

This quickly transformed into a swampland , which engulfed about ten acres on the family farm.

Upon receiving ownership of the RXR right of way yours truly went to work with a dozer and a backhoe creating a canal through the right of way allowing the damned water to flow freely into its long existing path and draining the short lived swamp reclaiming valuable farm ground.

Not long after I found myself being summoned to court by the DNR and this odd fed group called the USDA's Department Of Sustainable Development.

I quickly discovered these people were the real troublemakers.
And through some legal help discovered they are part of a UN plan called agenda 21.

It cost me a lot of time and money to beat these assholes.

So if you think they are another MIB myth, think again, they are very real, and very dangerous.

You would be amazed where they pop up and what they have their fingers into.

For instance, all of this global warming bullshit is of their making.

The democrat support is just not showing up at the polls, The right is on fire this election and its not just for trump.

Ummm, last I knew Ted considered himself a Baptist.
His parents left the catholic church when he was just a wee kid unit and his father and mother joined the Southern Baptist faith.

You my friend are what what our team likes to see getting involved , Young people, I am always reading and hearing from the msm that your generation is a lost cause, however my own personal observations are telling me otherwise.

When I attended the Iowa caucuses in my community there was a fairly large group of young people in attendance, I am talking late high school early college age, they were all hanging together and I was guessing they were all Rand Paul supporters.

During the candidate presentation prior to the vote I gave a short speech in support of Ted Cruz, and was surprised when not one single person spoke up for Rand Paul.

After the vote this group of young people came over to me and told me they liked my Ted Cruz speech, that is when I discovered every single one of them were Ted Cruz supporters !

I have since discovered that this is the norm and not unusual at all, I gotta tell you I find that highly encouraging for this nations future.

I have also found many younger people are highly receptive to Ted and his ideology, I have encountered several young people starting to pay attention to politics for one reason or another and have found with a little information and some gentle prodding they will take a look at Ted, and have all become converts.

2476,"This ""evangelicals"" going for trump issue has become an unexpected little benefit for yours truly.

You see my fellow posters despite you all knowing and believing me to be that big fuzzy teddy bear you have all come to love and adore I am actually  a demon possessed 'backslider' and outcast rebel of the Baptist brotherhood.

Or so I am told.

I know this may come as a shock to many of you on here, but this one time choir member and head of the church youth group quit attending services several years ago and has not graced the inner sanctum of salvation since, much to the chagrin of several of his fellow Baptist brethren.

For years now I have been plagued with the inevitable ""why don't you come to church anymore"" every time I meet any of my 'former' allies while out and about or while attending social gatherings of one sort or another.

However I discovered this past Sunday evening that the donald has done this demon infested malcontent an unforeseen service during his attempted rise to power, he has become the hero of those self proclaimed ""evangelicals"".

In so doing he has damaged their armor so to speak.

During the Sunday Gathering of the 'Herd' , that being a group of TWD fans who migrate to one of our members abode to watch our fave show in his theatre view equipped 'mancave' I found my self surrounded by a group of said ""evangelicals"" hell bent on forcing me to return to the 'House Of Worship'.

Outnumbered, and in peril my mind was in overdrive looking for an escape route, when suddenly a glimmer of hope developed into a thought and my mouth opened and I asked them ' who did you vote for in the Caucus' ?

As expected they all piped up and proudly declared , 'Donald Trump Of Course' !

Like the average standard issue nameless trump chumps they are they were oblivious to the fact that they had just lost a major battle.

Shaking my head with that demonic smirk I am credited with upon seeing yet another victory at hand I informed them I support Ted Cruz, still do and I voted for him.

I then tore into them informing them I never want to hear another word of condemnation from any self righteous trump supporter.

Because if they have no problem with his lifestyle and all of its obvious sins and immoral activities they sure as hell have no right to judge me and mine.

The look on their faces said everything, they knew I was right, and they knew they had screwed the pooch with their blatant ignorant support of trump.

I thank donald for his assistance in shedding me of that problem I have long confronted, I shall now wield him like the infamous black sword 'Stormbringer' every time I find myself confronted by the ""evangelicals' who have ill intent towards yours truly showing in their eyes.

2596,"&gt; I agree with you on your last sentence. But when we elect President Trump, you'll see that we've smartened up. No more rewarding illegals for invading our country, no more punishing cops for doing their job, no more obamacare... things are going to be good.

I honestly used to believe that, I used to think Trump had a lot going for him.

However the more I dig into his past, and listen to his empty rhetoric with its non existent plans to support any of it, I steadily lose ever more faith in trump.

I now believe he will sell out to the left without batting an eye, and when faced with the reality his empty rhetoric will take lots of work to apply, he will fold up like a chinese umbrella in an Oklahoma super twister.

He has illegals working for him at this very moment, he even stated last night he prefers them over U.S. citizens because he makes more money through their cheap labor.

The products that bear his name are produced in foreign nations.

His wives are foreigners.

He has never worked for anything in his life, and it shows with his disrespect for millions of hard working people he refers to as the 'poorly educated'.

I am not so sure that trump will not sell this nation out any longer, I once believed he wouldn't, what I am learning is I was misguided in that belief.",2016-02-26 13:41:52+00:00,d0ejf74,6.0,t1_d0ej2t6,784.0,Conservative

So I watched it, Well Ted's part anyway.

I was impressed and felt he really looked great in that venue.

When given a chance to speak the real Ted Cruz shows itself, and with how he addressed the questions he demonstrated how his core beliefs are not a hindrance, but an asset to a conservative ideology.

When asked about working with the opposition he clearly demonstrated he is willing to work with those who may not agree with his core beliefs and conservative ideology, however at the same time he is not going to abandon them to simply 'make the deal'.

That spoke volumes in my opinion.

That is your opinion, I disagree however in that this endorsement reflects the toxic vitriol emanating from Trumps campaign and his rants.

I support a lot of what donald is saying, however I also feel he often crosses the line and is obviously making promises and claims that will be impossible for him to fulfill.

At the same time he is projecting an ideology that can have detrimental repercussions when those easily excited to a religious fervor take his diatribe literally and believe it justifies activity beyond those of a civil society.

When you tell people someone is the enemy long, loud and continuously enough they soon begin to believe they must do something about that enemy especially if the government fails to.

At one time such ire was directed toward those of Jewish heritage and religious belief by a political leader, the eventual outcome of that ideology is well known, and should be something we learn from  and avoid repeating at all cost.",2016-02-25 18:27:18+00:00,d0dj1bg,4.0,t1_d0dihzd,692.0,Conservative

Why should Cruz drop out instead of rubio ?

Where has rubio won anything yet, and no claiming third and second place to be a victory does not count.

2681,"I readily admit the donald has his issues that give me cause to have concerns with him, however that damn rubio is nothing but a typical purdy boy scumbag snake in my opinion.

I do not trust rubio one iota, after doing some research on him I have come to believe he is a damn lying lib snake wearing a rotted dead pachyderm hide.

I told Clatsop long ago that he is the one who needs to go first because he was far more a danger to Ted Cruz than trump is.

The donald is unpredictable, and has leftist ties in his past, however he is like nitro, dangerous to handle no matter who the handler may be.

In that sense I see him being a better bet than rubio, the donald is more likely to resist the GOPe as well as the jackass party in its evil endeavours, where the rube is a proven loyal puppet in their pockets.

I also believe the donald wakes up every morning thinking what can I do for the nation today because its in my best interest also.

The rube always has his own interest in mind, no matter what effect it may have on our nation, just like the current purdy boy scumbag infesting the oval office.

Ted Cruz is by far the candidate the nation needs right now, and I will always believe that.
If not the white house, I would really like to see him get the current vacancy on the SCOTUS, in many ways that is a position that is actually even more appealing for Ted in my opinion.

Seated in the Supreme Court Ted cruz would be a force to reckon with for many years to come, and do so without having to face an election cycle every few years.

From my perspective Ted Cruz would be the perfect man to replace Scalia.

The county Sheriff was our precinct captain and knowing me and two of my comrades well (I know what your thinking, but we have all known each other since high school ) He assigned us the task of handing out the ballot slips.

Upon completing the task we found ourselves at the back of the very crowded room with extra slips in hand, I had 7 in my possession, my comrades each had 5.

We looked at our extra slips, shrugged and stuck them in our pockets since there was no trash receptacle handy.

After the caucus we piled into the troop transport and went for pizza, while waiting for our pizza I suddenly remembered the slips in my pocket and pulled them out, upon seeing mine my comrades laughingly did the same.

That is when we counted how many we had in hand and discussed how we had the power to alter our precincts vote in our hands all the time.

However it would not have changed the outcome, our precinct went with Cruz by a large majority, all our 'extra votes' would have done is made the margin of victory even bigger and probably had someone scratching their head when the registration tally did not match the vote count.

I mention this simply because I know how a caucus can be a very lax community affair and the captains pretty well know who they can and cannot trust.",2016-02-24 03:37:08+00:00,d0bj0rm,1.0,t3_47ahj2,1285.0,Conservative

It was not until the settlers with their tilling and fire control took over the land that trees were able to get a foot hold and survive to become the many forested areas we are familiar with today.

Is what caused me to question your stand on the issue.
Myself being a person who flies a Confederate Battle flag as a symbol of my rebellious spirit and protest against a tyrannical government that would control every aspect of our lives feel it is my right to do so out of personal expression.

Having lived in the Great State Of Texas for several years of my life I came to admire the culture of Southern Pride amongst the states people, a pride and culture I also know well from my relatives in North Carolina.

They do not fly a Confed Battle flag to express racism, as is claimed by the politically correct idiots, they do so out of pride in their heritage, it's spirit and the culture that is found throughout the southern states.

A culture by the way I being from Iowa find much more friendly than any I run across in the north eastern states.

The people mentioned above would never fly the Battle Flag above the U.S. Stars and Stripes, that would be a big taboo even in their eyes, The U.S. flag is the flag of their nation, a nation they are very proud of, the Battle Flag is the flag of their spirit, a spirit they are also proud of and rightfully so in this guy's opinion.

At the same time I for one have the same respect for the rainbow flag etc. it may not be my cup of tea, however I respect the rights of those who fly it to express themselves just as I do when I fly or wear or even sleep under the Confederate Battle Flag.

We had the great fortune of exploring the Yorktown on a weekday when she did not have that many visitors, and to our delight we discovered that of those few visitors was a group of elderly people who amongst them were three Gentlemen who had served on the mighty ship during WWII.

We first encountered them as we entered the ship and the three Vets. were telling their family and friends about the various areas of the ship at that point.

Upon realising they were former crew we asked a few questions, and they were happy to answer, so we asked if we could tag along and listen in, the whole bunch were happy to have us along, and it became obvious the three old warriors enjoyed having new ears to tell their tales of adventure to.

They knew every nook and cranny of the Yorktown and one or the other would take the time to explain what took place there and how  various artifacts and components operated.

Then there were the areas of the ship where they all had a story of being there when action took place and they were involved in some way, some of the stories had memories of lost friends, and others remembered how the crew fought dangerous flames heat and explosions during an attack from enemy planes while conducting raids on the Japanese islands around Okinawa.

We had started our tour around 9:00 in the morning and were surprised to discover it was a little after 4:00 in the afternoon when we departed the ship and said goodbye to our tour guides.

It was obvious they enjoyed the day just as much as we did, Listening to the old warriors tell about the action, sounds and show where it happened and what took place as it transpired brought the warship back to life and made you feel like you were seeing it as it happened through their eyes.",2016-02-19 23:39:34+00:00,d06hhm6,1.0,t3_46n9hf,3287.0,TedCruzForPresident

To exclude hunting/survival with firearms from those inalienable rights granted us by the constitution which is protected by the 2nd amendment gives those who would deny us our 2nd amendment rights an opening for gun control.

If you believe that it is wrong for U.S. citizens to kill animals, or hunt for survival then you believe they have no need to own any firearms for doing so.

By that you would eliminate firearms designed with that intent, restricting any you do own to being weapons of war,,, and one does not have to be very bright to see how shaky the ground gets from that point.

2980,"&gt; Fair enough, but I'd say that lots of people who are getting abortions are people who can't financially support a child. Because of the innate poverty of lots of low-income mothers who choose to abort, if these kids were born, then they would disproportionately commit crime and cost money to the prison/justice system. This is not to mention schooling, food stamps etc.

In that case it would have excluded everything east of the Mississippi and west of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.

It would have included all of Louisiana and parts of northern Texas with the rest of that state remaining under the control of mexico at the time.

Everything east of this area was greatly controlled by the east coast states and its larger cities such as New York, Chicago, Atlanta etc. , and everything in the midwest/Louisiana purchase territory was under the control of New orleans and St. Lois and their control over the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.

As time passed Texas gained control of the rest of itself and mexico lost control of the regions as far west as Nevada and Utah, when this took place that area was added to what was considered then as the midwest.

Later as Chicago's power expanded and St. Louis grew their influence over the region began to change the map until the Civil War greatly divided the nation along new lines of north and south.

3069,"There is something very suspicious about this Ben Carson Ted Cruz dustup.

Think about this, why would anyone involved in an election make an announcement like the carson campaign did just a few hours before the voting started ?

Now we know the supposed reasoning for this jumping off of the campaign trail was for some clean clothes, however why make a public announcement that anyone with a lick of sense could see would set the rumor mill running, which is exactly what took place.

Then ask yourself, does this really sound like something an intelligent person would do on the first day of trying out for the most important job in the world ?

I have never heard a reasonable explanation for this weirdness to this day.

We also know that the Cruz campaign was not the only one spreading this rumor around like wildfire, The rubio team was doing exactly the same thing.

Yet for some reason the rubio team has not received one accusatory word from the two antagonist pushing this issue that being Trump/Carson, in fact rubio has come out of this mess smelling like a rose.

Cnn has completely escaped any condemnation from the trump/carson team up as well, and they were the media responsible for initially broadcasting this info, which by the way brings up just how they got this info, and why it was even made available in the first place.

Since that story broke it has been constantly stirred by the trump/carson twosome, with both making accusations against Cruz and Cruz only, of vote fraud and election theft with both of them the victims of said actions by the cruz campaign.

Meanwhile we find out the carson campaign through mishandling of its cash supply is all but broke, and should probably have folded up after its poor showing in Iowa.

Carsons activities the following week did not reflect those of a person running a political campaign with the intention of winning, in fact it looked more like someone going through the motions and more interested in maintaining the squabble under way with Cruz rather than giving a damn about this nation and its interests.

During this time trump instead of going after the candidate chewing on his heels, that of course being rubio, instead attacks Cruz on a daily basis with the accusations that he and carson had obtained victimhood status by being supposedly robbed in Iowa by Cruz.

Then we find ourselves in New Hampshire, a hostile environment for both the cruz and carson campaigns it being common knowledge that their campaigns appeal to the same segment of voters.

A couple of days before the election in NH trump suddenly drops the Theft Rhetoric against Cruz and starts up with the mr. nice guy routine.

On election day we find out Trump and carson have been chatting and carson has been hinting he would be interested in the VP position because he knows his campaign is dead, however he is still in the game for what reason ?

And that carsons ex campaign manager has been working with the trump team in New Hampshire.

Meanwhile his presence in the election absorbs votes that would obviously went to only one other candidate, Ted Cruz.

Now who is stealing votes here ?

And who gains from the damage done by carsons presence in the election ?",2016-02-10 13:59:50+00:00,czuq66v,1.0,t3_450lnj,39258.0,Conservative

He is also vehemently against what he calls ""amnesty"", which may alienate him with the nearly 20% of this country with Hispanic backgrounds.

There are many Reagan Democrats amongst those Tea Party people you have so much disdain for, and also many unemployed democrats who are adamantly against amnesty ( you really don't pay attention to current events obviously ).

As for those 'independents', there was a big bunch of them at the poll I attended Monday night, and they all voted for Ted Cruz, now how did that happen ?

Ted Cruz not only proclaims those attributes, he has proven time and again that he unwaveringly will stand behind them, as did Rand Paul.

It also reminds me of a rather funny incident that happened to me during the pursuit of the item pictured while I lived in Texas during the 80's.

I had been living In the Dallas area for several months and during a lunch break stopped into a Dairy Queen in hopes of quenching a craving I had been enduring for some time.

As I scanned the menu hanging up behind the counter an attractive young lady kindly asked if she could help me.

Still searching that menu without spotting what my gut desired I asked her "" do you have tenderloins ?"" 

I then looked down just in time to see her turn and leave the counter to a back room, silently with a funny expression on her face.

I then continued to scan the menu, in a matter of seconds I heard a deep voice say, 'I will not allow you talk to my employees like that !"".

I looked down to see a fairly large black gentleman before me who was in an obviously irritated state, I then realised it was me he was addressing and irritated at.

As I stood there dumbfounded as to what I may have done to cause this reaction, ( a state I find myself in quite often by the way ) a man in line behind me spoke up.

He said, 'I can tell by his accent he is a yankee from up North, they have a sandwich up there called a tenderloin, he meant no harm.""

Upon hearing that it then sunk in what had happened, and I with a red face apologised to the manager telling him it never even occurred to me how what I said might be misconstrued like that.

He then broke out laughing and returned to the back room where shortly the young lady returned as red faced as I was, we both apologised to each other and I eventually had to settle for the standard issue burger and fries .

It was quite some time before I made it back to Iowa where I was finally able to satisfy my tenderloin craving in safety.",2016-02-01 15:31:34+00:00,czjrbbr,1.0,t3_43otns,1457.0,Conservative

The majority of Ted Cruz supporters are veteran caucus goers and evangelicals.

Both are well known for being hardy characters that can be counted on no matter the weather.

Here in iowa the weather this time of the year is usually snow, and we are currently under a winter weather watch right now and a blizzard warning for monday night.

Bad weather this time of year always hurts the caucus turnout, real bad weather really hurts it and all but eradicates the first time caucus goers.

As for any hope the election may be postponed, don't count on it, I Personally have been contacted twice by a couple of elderly poll workers during some very nasty weather for transportation to and from the polls ( They are long time friends of the family and know I have 4X4's )

Its a story she related to the County Clerk who then told our local newspaper about it and they ran it in the paper, I was razzed and applauded both, but my fave part was the delicious pies and home made bread I recieved as reward for a job well done from some appreciative Ladies in the community.

[McCain`s Birthright Citizenship, Yes–Illegals, No](http://www.vdare.com/posts/mccains-birthright-citizenship-yes-illegals-no)

Where there has always been some conflict with obama and his birthright is with the age of his mother when he was born and her having lived in the united states long enough to meet the 14 year requirement.

She was only 17, and lived in Hawaii which had only been a state for 6 years.

Speaking of obamas eligibility, if trump is honestly so damn concerned with this birthright issue why hasnt he put some of that billions of dollars to use finding out if obama is legally holding the oval office ?

I notice he has never had any issue about obamas eligibility when conducting any dealings with him, yet here he is saying he will not debate Cruz until he knows he is eligible.

As I said, bernie is promising FREE STUFF FOR EVERYONE !

Who wouldnt like bernie other than people who know its all B.S. and know who will actually be paying for that free stuff bernie is promising for his own benefit.

I imagine a 'grumpy' old conservative like myself would have lots of friends and followers if I promised free stuff to everyone, so how is bernie any better than me ?

When I was around the age of the majority of bernie's followers I supported and voted for another guy who promised free stuff and happiness forever.

And that guy, Jimmy Carter, was the worst president this nation ever had until obama took office.

The next general election I voted for a guy who promised us there was hard work ahead repairing the damage jimmy incurred upon us,but if we all worked together we could rebuild this nation and be proud to call ourselves Americans once again.

That mans name was Ronald Reagan.

I was embarrassed in knowing that I voted for jimmy carter, but I have always been proud to say that Ronald Reagan was My President.

I want another President I can be proud of, not one who promises the sky and delivers us darkness, despair and turmoil.

Ted is not a billionaire, like his main competitor.
When its all said and done trumpy will simply use it as a tax write off, meaning it is taxpayers like YOU and ME who are paying for his campaign.

&gt;Bernie being the other,

Bernie is promising FREE STUFF for everyone !

Ted is promising hard work ahead to repair the damage people like bernie and obama have done.

One is selling bullshit while the other is selling the truth, so what do you want, bullshit, or honesty ?

&gt; many people that says Ted Cruz isn't even allowed to run.

You mean trumps mindless minions are saying Cruz is not allowed to run.

Well, dont look now, but he is 'running for President', not running and hiding behind his money and big mouth like donny trump.

The first time I ever went turkey hunting they sent me out with this 'squawk box' that I was told sounded like a hen if one operated it correctly.

I had no idea how to operate the goofy thing , however off I went box in my pocket gun in hand.

I settled down by a huge oak near where we had seen a lot of gobbler activity than waited for some action.

Not long after , I spotted a bunch warily walking out into the open field and picking at the ground of the fresh picked corn field.
The problem was they were way across the field from me.

So, I thought, well I will see if I can make this box sound like a hen Chattering, 

I scratched the box with the stick, and it made a sound close to fingernails on a chalk board, but didn't sound like any darn turkey I have ever heard.

I looked up to see where the birds were and was shocked to see two big toms running as fast as they could right towards me !

I must have either sounded like the worlds sexiest hen turkey, or these were the horniest toms in Southern Iowa !

They ran right up to the edge of the tall grass that surrounded the tree I was under then stopped.

They stood there, there necks extended up looking about for that beautiful turkey babe that had just beckoned them.

I had lifted my shotgun and trained it on them as they ran towards me, and had one dead in my sights, BOOM !

I jumped up to see if I got him, and then realised there was a loud crashing noise behind me, I spun around to see a third tom flying blindly away in terror crashing through the tree limbs as he went !

Then I noticed the rest of the birds across the field had just vanished, and I couldn't see the tom I shot at so I walked to the edge of the field, and there he was,, and not far away was the other tom as well, both dead as a doorknob.

When I cleaned them later the tom I shot at had obvious buckshot damage, the other one, not a scratch, my grandfather said I had just scared him to death.

And they were both delicious by the way.

3612,"I was hired to drive a car to L.A. for a couple that had moved there from Des Moines ( The trip out was a story in itself, I found myself stuck in the middle of a blizzard crossing Nebraska and ran into a police chase and shootout between Vegas and L.A. ).

On my return trip I caught a red eye that had me jumping from L.A. to Vegas, where I then caught a flight that went back to Des Moines via a stopover in Omaha.

A little side story, on the hop to Vegas I sat with an elderly couple where the wife started up a conversation with me, she asked if I was going to Vegas for the weekend and I told here no I was heading back home to Iowa.

Upon hearing that she lit up and said they were originally from Iowa  also, she then asked where I lived, I told her, she then asked my name.

When I told her she asked her husband what was the name of that gas ( propane) company they bought gas from back home, He said the name, and yes it was the same last name as my own because my grandparents owned it.

She then said she remembered a young man used to deliver their gas and their dog just loved it when she heard that big truck pull in because he always had a little boy with him who would play with her while his dad filled the tank.

I shook my head knowingly and said, yep, that was me., and I even remembered their dogs name Maggie, a beautiful golden retriever.

Its a small world.

*(Upon telling the story about the elderly couple I forgot where I was and realised I forgot to tell about the hold up before we were allowed to board the plane for the trip to omaha.)

While waiting for the plane in Vegas people began to gather and suddenly in marched what looked like 6 fully armored police officers in swat gear.

A women from the airline was with them and she announced there would be a hold over on our plane while due to an incident on board that the police would have to take care of.

The plane landed, taxied up to the terminal, hooked up and then a very disheveled and rattled looking flight attendant opened the door allowing the police officers to quickly march in.

A few minutes later they returned with four officers carrying an obviously battered man by his arms and legs face down with a bloody towel wrapped around his head.
They were followed by two more battered looking individuals in handcuffs being herded along by the two remaining officers and two battered and shaken Flight attendants bringing up the rear.

There was no explanation made, after a short wait we were allowed onboard, and from all appearances nothing had taken place.

After a quiet flight to Omaha I just stayed on the plane for the last leg of my trip as everyone else disembarked, it was now 5:00 something in the morning.

As the plane taxied across the Omaha apron I realised I was the only person on the plane.

When we leveled out for the short hop to Des Moines the flight attendant stepped out of the galley and held up a bag of peanuts and a can of pop and shook the bag of nuts questioningly, I shook my head no and she returned to the galley.

As we descended into Des Moines she once again stepped out of the galley and walked down the aisle apparently checking for trash and lost items.
 I suddenly heard a ruckus so I turned around to see what was going on, it seems the attendant had discovered a girl in I would guess her mid twenties who had fallen asleep and missed her stop in Omaha.

She was upset, but the Attendant consoled her by telling her she could call her family and let them know what happened, and all she had to do was stay on the plane for the return trip to Omaha after the turnaround.

Case in point I was attending a big Pheasant Hunt here in Iowa a few years back at a friends farm where several of his friends from Chicago were invited to join in.

I was amongst a group of three fellas from Chicago I had never met before in my life, and due to us all being amongst the youngest and most fit we volunteered to walk a large field during the first drive of the day.

As we walked along we all chatted introducing ourselves, eventually one of the three asked what I did for a living so I told them, then I asked what they did.

They told me they all work together at the U.S. Post Office in Chicago.

A few seconds of silence followed this revelation as I pondered what I had just been told.

Then without missing a step I stated, "" So what your telling me is I am now walking across a large field with three armed postal workers ?""

They all three broke out laughing at that observation, and had to tell the rest of our party when we joined together later.
Yes they were and still are democrat union workers, as well as my friends.

However, when they do something unusual enough to gain my attention, you damn right I get interested in whats going on.

I lived in the Dallas Ft Worth area in a housing development in the suburb of Watauga.
You couldnt miss the neighbors acting oddly, they were just a few yards away and directly across the road.
In fact the one directly across the road from me was an ATF officer.

The talk of the neighborhood however was the couple that lived next door to the south.
There was always something weird going on there, loud noises, screaming, and one evening shortly after I moved in the wifes VW Scirocco busted out of the garage door with no one behind the wheel and took out the ATF guys mailbox !

If I hadnt seen it I wouldnt have believed it.
Something apparently shorted out and started the car which was in gear and away it went until it got hung up on the post that formerly held the mailbox.

Shortly after that incident I came home from work and they were loading their belongings into a U haul.

I went over to see if I could help carry a sofa they were having a tough time carrying out and she happily relinquished her position at one end.

After helping with several other bigger pieces we had the truck loaded, and I asked where they were going.

They told me as far away as possible, ""there was something weid about that house"", ""its haunted"".

After they left I told the neighbors what they had said at a get together that weekend, and several others who knew them better than me said they had been claiming that for quite some time, but they all thought the noises and flashing lights emanating from the house was just the couple acting weird.

The house remained empty for the next three years before it was bought by a young family with two kid units.
I lived next door to them for four more years and never heard a sound, and they never said anything about strange goings on.

[From the 8th century until the 15th century, the Republic of Venice and neighboring maritime republics held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East. The silk and spice trade, involving spices, incense, herbs, drugs and opium, made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in medieval medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics, perfumery, as well as food additives and preservatives. They were all imported from Asia and Africa.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery)

Muslim traders—mainly descendants of Arab sailors from Yemen and Oman—dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly Kozhikode, westward to Ormus in the Persian Gulf and Jeddah in the Red Sea. From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until **the rise of the Ottoman Empire, that eventually led to the fall of Constantinople in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.**

In 1415, Ceuta was conquered by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast. Young prince Henry the Navigator was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the Trans-Saharan trade routes. **For centuries slave and gold trade routes linking West Africa with the Mediterranean passed over the Western Sahara Desert, controlled by the Moors of North Africa.**

**Henry wished to know how far Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade directly with West Africa by sea**, find allies in legendary Christian lands to the south[32] like the long-lost Christian kingdom of Prester John[33] and to probe whether it was possible to reach the Indies by sea, the source of the lucrative spice trade",2015-11-21 04:17:47+00:00,cx7ojcm,2.0,t1_cx7ne7q,2643.0,ShitRConservativeSays

[At the start of World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_German_Americans) , under the authority of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, the United States government detained and interned as enemy aliens more than 11,000 German nationals, as well as detaining a small number of US citizens of German ethnicity, either naturalized or native-born. The aliens included immigrants to the U.S. as well as German nationals stranded in the U.S. by the hostilities. In many cases, the families of the internees were allowed to remain with them at internment camps in the U.S. In other cases, families were separated. Limited due process was allowed for those arrested and detained.

A total of 11,507 Germans and German-Americans were interned during the war. This group was overwhelmingly composed of German nationals. Together this group accounted for 36% of the total internments under the Justice Department's Enemy Alien Control Program.

By contrast, an estimated 110,000-120,000 Japanese-Americans were forcibly relocated from the West Coast and incarcerated in concentration camps in the interior run by an agency of the Department of Defense.

I checked the article once again, and the only mention of climate change was in a NASA release quoted in the article and that was simply in reference to the ipcc .

An employee’s belief or practice can be “religious” under Title VII even if the employee is affiliated with a religious group that does not espouse or recognize that individual’s belief or practice, or if few – or no – other people adhere to it.** Title VII’s protections also extend to those who are discriminated against or need accommodation because they profess no religious beliefs.

Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.f 24 And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.g 25 Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,h 26 and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil,i who has taken them captive to do his will.

Congratulations, ISIS.
You wanted attention, and yesterday, you got it. Only, you chose the wrong people to seek that attention from.
You did not get the attention of our weak President. He tweeted his support for your medieval holiday following your cowardly attack. You did not get the attention of our useless and corrupt Congress. They were too busy lining their pockets.
When you attacked those four Marines, you got the attention of every one of our 186,800 active duty Marines, along with every Marine who ever served.
You just stirred up hate, discontent, and malice within a group of people who relish the idea of engaging the enemy.
There is something you obviously don’t yet know about Marines…
The brotherhood we share is stronger than the challenges we face, the weapons we master, or the enemies we destroy.
You will learn that soon though.
You attacked a group of men who bond over the smell of gunpowder and misery—and enjoy it. You didn’t attack America’s leaders, you attacked America’s Marines, and that is a battle you are not prepared for.
You see, we won’t play by the rules you’re accustomed to seeing. When you play in our backyard, we don’t have to answer to any chain of command. We will not follow ridiculous ROEs crafted by a spineless bureaucrat to appease some goat herding tribal leader. And we won’t be wearing uniforms so that you can easily ambush us.
Nope. None of that shit.
When you think you’re walking into a target-rich environment, you’re really walking into an ambush.
That pudgy, middle-aged guy wearing khakis in the mall, who unbeknownst to you, is a former 0311 and armed, will dump your sorry ass before you have a chance to scream “allah snackbar.” And that soccer mom pushing a stroller, she’s got a Glock and will happily leave you gasping in a pool of your own blood before she lets you hurt her children.
We are here and we still have the training and experience to wage war, whether here or abroad. And wage war we will. Every one of us are willing to fight and die to protect our Marine Corps brothers and sisters, our families and friends, and our way of life.
And we will win, because while you fight to destroy what you hate, we fight to protect what we love.
Semper Fi!

One thing is for sure he has gathered a lot of support, and from across the political and social spectrum to boot.

That is an admirable feat in anyone's book, the last time I remember any candidate for president doing that trick was back in the mid 80's, which puts The Donald in good company in this posters opinion.

By law it does have the right according to the U.S. supreme court if that business is a small one controlled by an entity who's religious faith is in some way affected.

&gt;I do not feel that Christians are being persecuted.

Thats because you do not understand the Christian Religions ideology or beliefs on marriage, and I suspect even if you did you would not care. 

However what you believe is not at issue here it is what the person performing the service believes, that is protected by Constitutional law not just civil law.

Marriage in the Christian belief is a bit different from what is considered a "" modern legal marriage"". Marriage in the bible is neither a religious nor a civil matter, and the couple is considered married when the union was consummated.

At that point all legal benefits and recognition's are granted.

In our 'modern' world it is the legal marriage that provides similar protections. Merely having sex or living together does not provide the legal protections for spouses and children that the Biblical model of marriage provides, however in some states it does.

By participating in a homosexual 'marriage' in any way a Christian is performing a sin according to the bible by recognizing and abetting what it calls an 'abomination' and strongly condemns.

Since when did a legislated law trump Constitutional law ?

In case you have not noticed legislated acts of law are overturned by the courts quite often, Constitutional law, is a hell of a lot tougher to amend, even the tyrannical courts know they have no power to override it.

The civil rights laws are not constitutional laws, and the Constitutional law pertaining to the discussion at hand states :  **Congress shall make no law** respecting an establishment of religion, **or prohibiting the free exercise thereof**

You might also remember the recent hobby lobby decision, it does not bode well for the 1st amendment being trashed for civil rights legislation any time soon.

We went to the Revolutionary first, it was the battle of 'Moores Creek Bridge' , and to be honest I was expecting to be bored senseless, I never found the history of that era very interesting.

I was pleasantly surprised at how wrong I was, there were many different shows put on by various organizations and people of many talents and knowledge of the era and the background of the battle being recreated.

What was most interesting was the musicians speaking and demonstrating the importance of their trade during the war, and the many speakers representing both sides of the issue and demonstrating the tactics, participants and munitions of the time.

The speakers for the ""opposition"", that of course being Great Britain were several military officers and enlisted men from the U.K, their main speakers was an officer from the Royal Scots Dragoons.

He was in full dress of the period in representation, and when he gave his speech on their perspective of the confrontation it made you want to grab and wave a Union Flag and start singing 'God Save The King' !

I especially found his demonstration of who the Scottish Loyalist on the British side were and how they were equipped to fight in battle very interesting, my Scottish heritage may have had a little to do with that.

I discovered the real meaning behind songs I had heard and sung all my life, and that those guys wearing 'dresses' ( kilts ) were nothing to mess with at that time, they were world famous and respected for being the best bar none at hand to hand combat.

Early the next morning during the recreation with the fog of the river still hanging low and thick in the valley the Scotts began their march towards the bridge playing a battle march on the pipes.

You could not see them, but you could hear them getting closer, and the sound of the Bagpipes mixed with the tension of anticipation was utterly and eerily Unreal !

It was an experience I will never forget, and damn glad I did not miss.

The Civil War recreation was equally exciting, informative and interesting, of the two I will admit the Civil War recreation had more action as far as weaponry.

However the sound of those bagpipes emanating from that fog could never be overwhelmed by the roar of cannons or musketry for making ones hair stand on end !",2015-08-20 05:09:22+00:00,cu96iqb,2.0,t1_cu94n2b,4200.0,Conservative

[**What “Allahu Akbar” Really Means**](http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/commonwordcommonlord/2014/02/what-allahu-akbar-really-means.html)

Bear in mind that the Quran teaches :

The Quran:
Quran (2:191-193) - ""And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. **And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing**...
but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful.   And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and **worship is for Allah alone**.

Quran (8:15) - ""O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end.""

Quran (8:39) - ""And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion should be only for Allah"" 

Quran (9:14) -**""Fight against them so that Allah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people.""**  Humiliating and hurting non-believers not only has the blessing of Allah, but it is ordered as a means of carrying out his punishment and even ""healing"" the hearts of Muslims.

I had no use for romney, however I was denigrated when I dared question his conservative values by those on here who claim to be Conservatives, the only thing romney had going for him in my opinion is he wasnt ohbahmuh.

Same goes for McCain, The only redeeming thing he had going for him was Sarah Palin and once again the fact he ended up running against a communist/socialist habitual liar.

Trump has the bagage of being a business man in a democrat controlled region weighing against him, meaning to do said business he had to grease the palms and associate with the left to get along and get things done.

Should he be judged by his actions under such circumstances ?
I am not sure, I still cannot forgive Newt for sitting on that couch with the wicked witch from the west and spewing toxic global warming bullshit.

That being said, I still have respect for Newt to a degree, and were he to be the nominee I would have no trouble supporting and voting for him.

I like Trumps feisty attitude and outspoken brazenness, he says what is on his mind, to hell with those who do not like it.

I get the impression he honestly cares about this nation, not pc bullshit, not whatever makes the world 'like us better' and certainly not whatever would be the path of least resistance.

In that respect he reminds me a lot of Theodore Roosevelt, a person I have come to admire as I learned more about him.

Do I agree with everything Trump says, no, however I have yet to hear him say anything I find completely unacceptable as I did romney and McCain.

In my opinion he is a Conservative in the sense he doesnt want to turn this nation into a socialist shit hole as does the current dweller of the oval office, and he has demonstrated he has an interest in respecting and protecting many of the institutions that have made this nation the greatest on Earth.

• Global climate models are unable to make
accurate projections of climate even 10 years
ahead, let alone the 100-year period that has
been adopted by policy planners. The output
of such models should therefore not be used
to guide public policy formulation.
• Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the
reported late twentieth century surface
warming (1979–2000) lay outside the range
of normal natural variability, nor were they in
any way unusual compared to earlier
episodes in Earth’s climatic history.
• Solar forcing of temperature change is likely
more important than is currently recognized.
• No unambiguous evidence exists of
dangerous interference in the global climate
caused by human-related CO2 emissions. In
particular, the cryosphere is not melting at an
enhanced rate; sea-level rise is not
accelerating; and no systematic changes
have been documented in evaporation or
rainfall or in the magnitude or intensity of
extreme meteorological events.
• Any human global climate signal is so small
as to be nearly indiscernible against the
background variability of the natural climate
system. Climate change is always occurring.
• A phase of temperature stasis or cooling
has succeeded the mild warming of the
twentieth century. Similar periods of warming
and cooling due to natural variability are
certain to occur in the future irrespective of
human emissions of greenhouse gases.

**The IPCC was created in 1988 largely due to the efforts of Maurice Strong, a billionaire and self-confessed socialist, as part of a larger campaign to justify giving the United Nations the authority to tax businesses in developed countries and redistribute trillions of dollars a year to developing nations. Strong had previously succeeded in bringing about the creation of the UN Environment Programme in 1972 and served as its first executive director. The IPCC is a joint project of that entity and the World Meteorological Organization.**

**(Strong was subsequently implicated in corruption surrounding the UN’s Oil-for-Food-Program and has resigned from his UN positions. According to John Izzard writing for the Australian publication Quadrant Online, &lt;1&gt; “Following his exposure for bribery and corruption in the UN’s Oil-for-Food scandal Maurice Strong was stripped of many of his 53 international awards and honours he had collected during his lifetime working in dual role of arch conservationist and ruthless businessman.”&lt;1&gt;)**

**Strong and his allies at the UN gave the IPCC a very narrow brief by defining climate change in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, Article 1.2, as “a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.” IPCC’s mandate is not to study climate change “in the round,” or to look at natural as well as man-made influences on climate. It is to specifically find and report a human impact on climate, and thereby make a scientific case for the adoption of national and international policies that would supposedly reduce that impact.**

**The IPCC is also designed to put political leaders and bureaucrats rather than scientists in control of the research project. It is a membership organization composed of governments, not scientists. The governments that created the IPCC fund it, staff it, select the scientists who get to participate, and revise and rewrite the reports after the scientists have concluded their work. Obviously, this is not how a real scientific organization operates.**

**The IPCC’s first report, released in 1990, admitted that observed climate change was probably due to natural rather than human causes. However, every report since then has claimed with rising certainty that there is a “discernable human impact” on the climate and that steps must be taken to avoid a global climate crisis. There is ample evidence that this level of alarmism and asserted confidence is fueled by political considerations rather than actual science.**

**For example, in 1996, Dr. Frederick Seitz, one of the world’s most prominent and respected physicists, wrote in the Wall Street Journal: &lt;2&gt;“In my more than 60 years as a member of the American scientific community, including service as president of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Physical Society, I have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer-review process than the events that led to this IPCC report.”**

**Numerous authors (see here, here, and here)&lt;3&gt; have observed a growing disconnect between the “Summaries for Policymakers,” which are designed to be read and used by political leaders and the media, and the reports themselves. The former systematically remove the expressions of scientific uncertainty and alternative explanations of climate phenomena that were abundantly present in the first three reports, with the obvious intention of misrepresenting the science and fueling unnecessary alarm. By the fourth and fifth assessment reports, even the underlying reports were being purged of ideas and evidence that contradicted the IPCC’s political agenda.**

**In 2009, a hacker or whistle blower made available on the Internet a collection of email exchanges among leading authors and contributors to the IPCC reports. The ensuing scandal, called Climategate, &lt;4&gt; exposed efforts by IPCC authors to withhold data from independent scholars and attempt to prevent peer-reviewed journals from publishing research that undermined or questioned their own work. In 2011 &lt;5&gt; the hacker or whistle blower released a second batch of emails that made even more clear that the IPCC process was broken.**

**This sordid history has led to calls for the IPCC to be dismantled &lt;6&gt; and for its Fifth Assessment to be its last. &lt;7&gt; This would be good news, though long over-due. The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) was created to take the IPCC’s place by giving honest scientists an alternative outlet for their work and citizens of the world a genuinely independent source of research on this issue.**",2015-08-05 08:36:43+00:00,cts49dh,4.0,t1_ctqj7d5,116422.0,Conservative

""Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound
reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world
has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both
governments and individuals and an unprecedented
redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift
will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences
of every human action be integrated into individual and
collective decision-making at every level.""

It was insane, I was sitting on the 'bench' attached to the rear bulkhead safely strapped into place while the crew sat on the door sills, no safety straps , PERIOD, legs hanging out like they were on a hay ride while we whipped around trees and hillsides following a nearby river.

They are nuts !
But I have to admit it was fun.

The second ""ride"" was this past march when a strange man and a woman in black suits grabbed me and wrapped me up in some dark bag then strapped me to a gurney and stuffed me into a black helicopter which took me to some large institutional building where they placed me on a table with bright lights shining in my face, poked me with needles, cut me with knives and pumped hallucinogenic drugs and strange looking chemicals into me.

4543," From the link.


I called Grassroots Campaigns and spoke to an individual there familiar with the ad. He explained it is part of an ongoing campaign being run on behalf of Planned Parenthood. PP has been hiring grassroots fundraisers since last summer. The Craigslist ad is part of that fundraising campaign, not an attempt to hire protest organizers.

There is another link on the ad itself which leads to this page offering full time “Assistant Canvas Director” jobs. The job description reads in part “Canvass in the field for four days per week, to train new and
experienced staff in the field and meet personal fundraising
requirements.” So it’s definitely a fundraising job.

Planned Parenthood is working with Grassroots Campaigns to hire fundraisers in Austin and also, it appears, in other locations around the country. **These job listings are not part of the recent attempts to block SB5 though it’s probably not a stretch to imagine some of the folks will be participating in the protests.**",2015-07-29 02:38:37+00:00,ctjt4au,2.0,t1_ctjrry6,2252.0,Conservative

At the same time, they began a cynical smear campaign to label anyone who opposes their devious strategy as greedy racists.**

How quaint.

Now dont all of ya go pissing your pants at once because I have blessed you with my presence, the place already reeks bad enough.

As for why I am here, well my #1 fan requested I make an appearance , and being the great guy I am I just couldnt let him down now could I !

So remember to thank,,, uhm ,, oh,,, uh,, oh hell whatever the idiots name is, it doesnt matter anyway.

So without further fanfare, I will answer his brainless blabberings.


&gt;Here's my question. Assuming this story is true (it's not)**( like he was there)**

&gt; I see no evidence that this person was a liberal, or a gay, or a hate maggot or whatever new term he's learned that day. If I see someone screeching and breaking things in a department store, I will assume they are just mentally ill without regard to their political affiliations.

**Who what ????** 

**where the hell did that bullshit come from, I never once claimed there was any political affiliation or anything even close, he must have dreamed that up during one of his whack off sessions while fantasizing about me.**

&gt;And how well-connected was this demon maggot that everyone in the parking lot knew who his parents were?

**And where did I state that everyone in the parking lot knew the piece of shit or his family ?**

**To the best of my knowledge no one knew who the kid was until the police and his parents arrived, nor did I ever state otherwise.**

**Again, more delusions by you know who.**

 &gt;And why is this guy's mother going crazy and hitting police?

**Only God and the skanky bitch herself would know that, all I know and ever stated was that one minute she was talking to an officer, and suddenly she started screeching and hitting the cop, which got her manhandled, cuffed and deposited promptly into the cruiser.**

&gt;And how did /u/propshaft find out later that the guy lost teeth? Did the guy's friends find him and tell him?! 

**Well since he who has no sense demands to know, I guess I'll have to tell you.**

**It stated so in a letter I received from a ( supposed ) fly by night lawyer attempting to scare me into paying for the Damages and accrued expenses.**

**I properly filed the letter in the trash where it belonged and never heard another word about the ordeal.**


**Now to address whatever his name is using his own words** ""What a dumbass.""

4742,"I had an encounter with a demon possessed maggot like this several years ago.

The scumbag was in a sportsman's outlet slinking around deliberately snapping the fishing rods in half breaking them.
I saw him break one and jumped him about it, like the demon infested turd in the vid he went into a shrieking tirade which brought management who promptly escorted him outside.

Unfortunately they did not call the law, they just let the bastard go and told him not to come back.

Later as my friends and I made our purchases and left the store we were walking towards the truck when I heard something behind me and the next thing I know I was clobbered in the back of the head by a damn tree limb the bastard had hit me with.

I was dazed, and my friends were shocked, however I looked up to see the demon coming again with the limb raised about to hit me again !

I grabbed the limb before it struck me and the demon began screeching again, but not for very long because I quickly knocked him on his ass and out cold with a hard punch to his face.

Several people saw the incident and gathered around, one idiot kept saying, you just made a mistake buddy his mother and father will sue you penniless.

Within minutes the police and an ambulance arrived , and they loaded up the now silent demon.
A few moments later as I was talking with one of the officers about the incident the mother of the maggot arrived and upon learning I was the one who had sent her piece of shit to the hospital she started up with the mouthing off and threats.

When she learned the police were not going to press any charges she started screeching herself.
They tried to explain to her that I had the right to defend myself, but she was having no part of it, which eventually got her cuffed and placed in a cruiser when she hit one of the cops.

I was later told the little maggot lost three of his front teeth and had to have his jaw wired shut for over a month because I had broken it in two places.

His stance on illegal invaders for starters.

Mr. Trump appears on Fox and Friends on Monday mornings and devotes much of his time to media interviews in order to promote a Free Market, the importance of a strong family, a culture of Life, a strong military and our country’s sacred obligation to take care of our veterans and their families.

The cross country route was an option available only during early spring weather, vegetation and parasitic insects or wildlife and Mom allowing.

Admittedly one hostile wildlife encounter event ended up with me being weaponized to ensure safer journeys during our trips to lower level education in the local 'rural school'.
That encounter being with a hostile skunk which may or may not have been rabid, but certainly with a bad attitude and penchant for sharing it perfumery with anyone or thing unfortunate enough to wander within range.

Sis, myself and Twiggy our ever present Beagle escort named after a famous Brit Super model of the era, finding ourselves so victimized by said skunk that day found ourselves banned from the one room institution of education and sent back home for odor removal.

Pop armed me with a 22 Remington rifle to ward off any future such encounters while traversing the 'hood'.

Taking the long gravel road route had a rather unusual characteristic associated with it as well.

While passing the three residents along that route we would have their various four legged security guards join us on our journey.

While in School Twiggy and company would hang out under the shade tree  or playground merry ground waiting for those imprisoned inside the government establishment to be released on recess and lunch furloughs, lunch being their favored occasion of course.

This doggy entourage would then join us on the return home dropping off at their assigned residence along the way.

At the time it was just another part of our daily routine, now that I think about it there was something rather comical and quaint about what we took so casually.

4859,"The Constitutional Amendment Process
The authority to amend the Constitution of the United States is derived from Article V of the Constitution. After Congress proposes an amendment, the Archivist of the United States, who heads the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), is charged with responsibility for administering the ratification process under the provisions of 1 U.S.C. 106b. The Archivist has delegated many of the ministerial duties associated with this function to the Director of the Federal Register. Neither Article V of the Constitution nor section 106b describe the ratification process in detail. The Archivist and the Director of the Federal Register follow procedures and customs established by the Secretary of State, who performed these duties until 1950, and the Administrator of General Services, who served in this capacity until NARA assumed responsibility as an independent agency in 1985.

The Constitution provides that an amendment may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the State legislatures. None of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by constitutional convention. The Congress proposes an amendment in the form of a joint resolution. Since the President does not have a constitutional role in the amendment process, the joint resolution does not go to the White House for signature or approval. The original document is forwarded directly to NARA's Office of the Federal Register (OFR) for processing and publication. The OFR adds legislative history notes to the joint resolution and publishes it in slip law format. The OFR also assembles an information package for the States which includes formal ""red-line"" copies of the joint resolution, copies of the joint resolution in slip law format, and the statutory procedure for ratification under 1 U.S.C. 106b.

[(CNN)](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/06/us/san-francisco-killing-sanctuary-cities/)The killing last week of a San Francisco woman, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant with a felony record, has put the spotlight on the city's policy of refusing to honor federal requests to hold on to people found to be in the country illegally.

San Francisco authorities released suspect Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez in April after dropping the drug charges on which they had asked federal authorities to turn him over -- even though federal officials had asked the city to let them know if they were going to cut him loose.

The city, however, doesn't honor such immigration detention requests under its 26-year-old sanctuary law.

""Equal protection"" for what ?

Equal protection for all forms of sexual perversity to become part of the institution of marriage ?

Thats what you were striving for wasnt it, homosexual/gay ""marriage"" ?

It was not and is not called common or like gender marriage, no the sexual orientation was always and constantly strove and fought for.

Had it been gender, this would be it, war over, battle won, there are only two kind.

There is a little problem with your 'who shot first' claim here.

First of all South Carolina did not 'take' the fort, it was already located on their real estate.

Second that property which was unoccupied at the time of South Carolina's seceding from the union was 'invaded' illegally by cowardly union vermin who had abandoned and fled Fort Moultrie nearby.

When 'kindly' asked to vacate the premises by Confederate Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard said infesting yankee vermin refused to do so.

Due to their illegal and hostile invasion of the South Carolina property, and refusal to leave, they forced the hand of said properties owners to engage in use of force to remove said vermin from the location.

Due to the marksmanship and humanitarian mercy of the Confederate batteries not one person occupying that fort was harmed !

In fact, the only casualties experienced during the entire engagement befell on two union soldiers who were killed by an explosion that took place when the idiot yankee Maj. Robert Anderson insisted that his men be allowed to perform a 100 gun salute !

James Madison (1751–1836), who is considered one of the main figures behind the U.S. Constitution, maintained that slavery formed the ""line of discrimination"" at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. To ensure ratification of a U.S. constitution, northern and southern delegates reached a number of compromises that, according to Professor Eric Foner, ""left the institution [of slavery] more deeply embedded than ever in American life."" The slave-trade clause permitted the continued importation of slaves until at least 1808, a provision that many condemned. The fugitive-slave clause protected slavery even in free states: If a slave escaped to a free state, his status remained that of a slave. In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Law even required the capture and return of runaway slaves by citizens of the North.

Article IV, Section 2. This is the fugitive-slave clause which reads:

No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom Service or Labour may be due.

This clause explains that no person held in service (which implied slavery) or labor in one state, and under that state’s laws, can escape into another state and be relieved of his services. Even if a slave escapes to a free state with laws prohibiting slavery, he still must be returned to his rightful owner to whom he owes his services in the slave state. He is still a slave no matter where he is, as long as he belongs to his master. This point would later be discussed in the opinion of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott decision. This clause ""…became the basis for the more notorious kind of federal intervention in behalf of the institution."" It provided for the enforcement of returning slaves anywhere in the Union to their rightful master.
The clause’s wording was very ambiguous and seemed to include apprentices and anyone else bound to service for a limited period. ""…it drew no distinction between free ad non-free persons."" It was ""[N]ot in what it said, but only how it was universally understood,…[that] the so-called fugitive-slave clause acknowledge[d] the existence of slavery in America."" 8 As with the other clauses, this one also did not use the word slavery, but it was understood to pertain to slaves.
The fugitive-slave clause is also distinguishable from the one that precedes it in Article IV, Section 2. This clause explains that ""A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime"" who flees from justice shall be delivered to the state having jurisdiction over the crime. This clause more clearly indicates the type of person sought out to be returned to a state. Its wording refers to criminal activity, while the clause following it refers to a person held in service or labor.
There is also a distinguished difference between the actual wording in the first clause and the wording in the second clause. The fugitive in the first clause is referred to as ""flee[ing] from Justice,"" while the slave is referred to as ""escaping"" from ""Service or Labour in one State."" Thus, the fugitive-slave clause clearly refers to slavery.
The placement of the fugitive-slave clause in Article IV and not in Article I ""…suggests that it was designed as a limitation on state authority and not as an extension of federal power and responsibility."" 9 Article IV outlines the powers of the states and not the powers of the federal government. This clause reminds us that slavery is an issue of state, not federal, laws. Also, the fact that not all states permitted slavery suggests that slave laws may have been considered unjust by non-slave states.

5036,"As a panel of historians emphasized in 2011, ""while slavery and its various and multifaceted discontents were the primary cause of disunion, it was disunion itself that sparked the war.""Pulitzer Prize winning author David Potter wrote, ""The problem for Americans who, in the age of Lincoln, wanted slaves to be free was not simply that southerners wanted the opposite, but that they themselves cherished a conflicting value: **they wanted the Constitution, which protected slavery, to be honored**, and the Union, which had fellowship with slaveholders, to be preserved. Thus they were committed to values that could not logically be reconciled.""Other important factors were partisan politics, abolitionism, Southern nationalism, Northern nationalism, expansionism, economics and modernization in the Antebellum period.

I am told its a subsidy because it would be tax dollars if not for the incentive, yet in my opinion this means all money is the property of the federal government.

Which means any money anyone is allowed to keep and spend as they wish is a subsidy.

[con·ser·va·tism  (kən-sûr′və-tĭz′əm)](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Conservative+(politics)
n.
1. The inclination, especially in politics, to maintain the existing or traditional order.
2. A political philosophy or attitude that emphasizes respect for traditional institutions and opposes the attempt to achieve social change though legislation or publicly funded programs.
3. Caution or moderation, as in behavior or outlook.

Do I need to explain further ?

Admittedly that third part doesnt fit me to well ( Caution or moderation, as in behavior or outlook.) I am more the damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead type than a cautious one, I am an avid motorcyclist and have jumped out of perfectly good aircraft during my younger wilder years, otherwise the definition fits me pretty well.
