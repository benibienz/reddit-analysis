Have any of them claimed to have been offended and are now requesting/demanding an apology ?

That being said, is Trump the one who has dumped this questionable recording on the nation and brought it to public attention ?

Obviously not, in which case I have to ask, how is he responsible for it offending anyone ?

Doesn't that responsibility lie with the persons or organizations who did release it upon the nations media ?

Where is the apologies from the people responsible for doing just that ?

I hear far far worse emanating from rap crap and gangsta garbage, yet I never recall anyone demanding any of them apologise to anyone, especially women and the police.

Yet their gutter talk is common place on the airwaves and market and intentionally and knowingly recorded with the intention of it being marketed and heard far and wide.

When are they going to apologise ?

If anyone owes an apology to anyone its the clinton campaign for abusing the privacy of Trump and company by dragging this recording into the public.

I for one have yet to hear any apology from haggy hill for her calling millions of our fellow Americans deplorable and worse.

Where is the msm's demand that that wretched witch apologise and be held accountable for her filthy mouth ?",ConservativesOnly,An honest serious question: Who and why does Trump owe an apology to ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConservativesOnly/comments/56ofq3/an_honest_serious_question_who_and_why_does_trump/

It was easily the weirdest election to date.

The Democrats cancelled their convention and unanimously decided to support a Republican candidate, who died during the election before the Electoral Votes were tallied.

Those votes for him were later disallowed by Congress.

The Women's Suffrage movement nominated the first woman to run for the nations highest office, Victoria Woodhull,  as well as the first black Vice Presidential candidate, Frederick Douglass. 

On the day before the election Woodhull was arrested for ""publishing an obscene newspaper"", then deemed ineligible for the office because she would not reach the constitutionally prescribed minimum age of 35 until September 23, 1873.

Now we have another woman running for the nations highest office with a foreboding dark cloud of criminal charges looming over her.

Might lightning strike twice ?

That being the case the Donald held his own, he obviously lost some ground with the GOP when he would not confirm he would stand behind its nominee if it was not him, however I personally do not hold that against him.

After all should that nominee be christie or jeb, I would agree with him.

Ted Cruz came out looking Presidential, he was not allowed to speak much, but when he did he carried himself very well and showed his knowledge on the issues.

Cruz has the ability to talk to the people in a manner that shows intelligence without being arrogant, when he speaks he demonstrates leadership as well as a humbleness that commands attention yet draws respect.

I was a bit disappointed in Walker, however keeping in mind his background he held a steady course.

I liked Paul's jabbing's at the 500 pound gorilla in the room, his tussle with christie, I just wish he had been allowed more time to continue jabbing.
I felt he gained some ground with his clarification of his views on foreign affairs, an issue that has given me some apprehension, he left me feeling better about supporting him.

Huck was Huck, having seen lots of him during the 08 elections here In Iowa I pretty well knew what to expect, and he has not changed one bit, he's likable, but I am not sure he would make a good leader.

Jeb and christie, no change there in my opinion, they gotta GO !

Carson, smart, however he just does not seem to light a fire in anyone, Hes a guy you like to like, however he just comes off as not really wanting the job.

Rubio, first time I have ever really payed much attention to the guy, not bad, but not ready for the job, yet.
