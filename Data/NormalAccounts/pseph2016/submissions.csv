I noticed that TV stations waited until 11pm ET to 'call' Obama's victory. 11pm ET is (8pm Pacific time) when voting closes in California (55 college votes), Washington state (12 votes), Oregon (7) and Idaho (4).

However CA, WA and OR were/are known to be safe Democrat states, so it should be obvious to most observers that those 74 votes were/are near certain for the Democrat candidate.

Furthermore, at 11:00:01pm, there would be no official vote counts available, because only 1 second had passed since the closure of voting. Why did TV stations bother (especially in 2008, when Obama won easily) waiting until 11pm to call the election for Obama, when it was obvious that he would win CA, WA and OR?

Likewise in this year, Clinton should easily win the 74 votes in CA, WA and OR. If a TV network has called for Clinton to have at least 196 votes before 11pm, will they again play the charade of waiting until 11pm to call a Clinton victory, even though no official vote counts are available at 11:00:01 ?

Edited: The first 40 seconds of this video best describes my question:
