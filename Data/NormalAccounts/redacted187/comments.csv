175,"In case you're still pursuing this, I'd like to help. i came from Google, looking for the same thing. I have it all figured out now, working perfectly with 3 player splitscreen!

Step 1: Every player needs a controller. I suppose you could use a keyboard for one of them, but that would be weird and causes all sorts of inconveniences.

Step 2: Download [this](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1283271-joypad-mod-usb-controller-split-screen-over-350k) mod and install it. If you don't know how to install mods, there are a lot of cool videos that make it easy to learn. Make sure you have the right version of the mod for the right version of the game. Right now the latest version of that mod is 1.9, so you need minecraft 1.9 and forge 1.9 for it to work.

Step 3: (optional) go into the [jvm arguments section](http://i.imgur.com/wv7DzSz.png) of the profile editor, and type in: `-Dorg.lwjgl.opengl.Window.undecorated=true`

That'll allow you to have little to no border in between screens, so it's like seamless splitscreen.

Step 4: Open each player's minecraft instance one at a time, that way you can all use the same account to play. Like this: Open minecraft, start a LAN game. Open minecraft again (for player 2) join the Lan game. repeat that last one for however many players. There is one downside, though: Each player wont be able to have their own personal skin. That's only possible with multiple accounts. (You can pretty much disregard this step if you intend to use more than one account).

EDIT: Woah, I found a WAY better guide. It is a little more complicated, but I think it's worth it. I'm using a combo of what I told you and [this guide](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/unmodified-minecraft-client/tutorials-and-faqs/2192485-same-pc-multiplayer-w-guide-up-to-4-players) from now on.",2016-07-20 17:06:35+00:00,d5jrkqy,,t1_czs225c,,Minecraft

There's so much information that Googling barely ever works unless you know before hand exactly what to look for, and even then there's not a very good chance you'll get info that actually helps. You install Windows, and you know what's happening. No, it's not because I'm stupid and need guidance like a stupid baby, it's because Linux is just a huge clusterfuck in general and you're expected to just know how everything works before you even do anything.

Windows - You're friend throws you a ball, and you want to catch it. You know what to do, just open your hands, follow the easily predictable path of the ball, and put your hands where the ball will be. When it reaches your hands, close them around the ball. Simple, you almost instinctively knew what to do.

Linux - You're friend throws you a ball, and you want to catch it. You know what to do, it's simple.

Yeah that was my bad, I brought opinions of my own into the mix. But, the fact is, it has more animations, and that's usually considered an improvement.

The core of this whole argument is almost entirely based on opinions, though. ""Better"" than 7 is, and always will be, an opinion. I really want to keep this opinion-light. Yes, I believe it's better than 7. I used xp for it's entire run, skipped vista, used 7 for it's entire run, 8 for it's entire run, and 10 since the first insider builds. In my experience, Windows 10 has provided the most user friendly, best performing experience.

*  It runs better. It can be installed on awful systems and run perfectly fine, in places where older OSs can't. Just better optimized in general. DX12 obviously is a huuuge plus. It doesn't matter if Vulkan is better if nobody is using it. I like having both. This should be a big deal to all of us here, because we're gamers.

&amp;nbsp;



Those are the biggest two I can think of right now, but they cover a LOT of things. This list was like 11 reasons long until I stopped and realized I could compact them into two.

Also, if you don't like something, you can change it. I didn't like the default explorer, so I got [Clover](http://ejie.me/). I also suggest [Winaero Tweaker](http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.1836) for anything else you don't like. It ""fixes"" everything you don't like.

Also, I'm not saying it's perfect, because it's not. It's just not as ridiculously awful as you want people to believe.

There are a lot of valid criticisms to be had about 10, but you've listed almost none.

&amp;nbsp;



&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;



&gt; *    The Windows 10 EULA is stupid.

&amp;nbsp;



Okay, that's pretty subjective. Do you have a reason? You can call anything stupid without a reason.

&gt; *    Windows 10 is spyware according to Microsoft's own definition. [source](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/pc-security/spyware-whatis.aspx)

&amp;nbsp;



http://i.imgur.com/EquSq4c.png

""Without your consent"" is important here. You know what you're getting before you install it, and besides that it's all incredibly easy to disable. I saw it, and within the first few minutes of me using it it was gone for good.

&amp;nbsp;




&gt; *    Windows 10's update is [annoying](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/fl0m-windows-twitch-update/)

&amp;nbsp;



Again, subjective. Again, you can disable it. 

[Just a quick google search shows you tons of ways how](https://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=stop+windows+10+from+updating&amp;oq=stop+windows+10+from+&amp;gs_l=serp.3.1.0i20l2j0l8.10960.14762.0.17090.21.13.0.8.8.0.130.1363.6j7.13.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..0.21.1376...35i39j0i67j0i131i10i67j0i131j0i10.X_keWo3rfpQ)


&amp;nbsp;


&gt; *    Windows 10 aggressively tries to install itself on Windows 7 and 8.1 computers.

&amp;nbsp;



Yeah, I agree with that. It's still subjective, though.

&amp;nbsp;



&gt; *    Windows 10 broke full disk encryption in Truecrypt/Veracrypt, which are the only disk-encryption tools for Windows without backdoor.

&amp;nbsp;



I don't know enough about this to say anything about it. For now I'll assume it's true.

&gt; *    Some people complain about broken drivers, and Windows update replaces working ones with broken versions.

&amp;nbsp;



""Some people"". Also, yeah, you're installing a whole new operating system, it's never going to be perfect. It gets damn near close, though. You can also prevent it from doing stuff to your drivers automatically. [Link](http://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/)

&amp;nbsp;



&gt; *    The settings are trimmed down a lot compared to Windows 7. To set your printer to print on both sides, you must access the Windows 7 settings menu.

&amp;nbsp;



No, the control panel is still there. They just decided to make another settings menu with less options. They never removed the control panel. (Or ""Windows 7 Settings"" as you called it.)


&amp;nbsp;


&gt; *    There are a ton of pre-installed programs which cannot be removed.

&amp;nbsp;



They are basically unnoticeable and still [super easy](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-remove-bloatware-windows-10/) to remove.

&amp;nbsp;



&gt; *    Error messages are not helpful. (""Something went wrong"")

&amp;nbsp;



Error messages have NEVER been helpful on windows. They didn't get better or worse.

&amp;nbsp;



&gt; *    Because Windows 10 uses secureboot it is more difficult to reinstall.

&amp;nbsp;



I've reinstalled windows so many times, it's funny. I've never had trouble. If you're having trouble, [use google.](https://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=windows+10+reinstall&amp;oq=windows+10+reinstall&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0l2j0i20l2j0l6.8709.10824.0.11044.9.5.0.4.4.0.192.623.2j3.5.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..0.9.638...0i67.qJBUfEgCgg0)

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; *    Logging into your computer goes via your Microsoft-account. Which is weird, because the Microsoft-account is something online, while your computer can be offline. One time I did not succeed in changing my own password.

&amp;nbsp;

You have an option when creating your account to link it to your MS account or not. You can create local accounts, I'm not sure why you think you can't.

&amp;nbsp;



&gt; *    The flat theme used in Windows 10 makes it completely unclear which window is selected.

&amp;nbsp;



[Not really.](http://i.imgur.com/QYo8kAQ.png) Maybe if you're blind.

&amp;nbsp;



&gt; *    The lockscreen is annoying: I boot my computer to use it, so why am I presented with a lock-screen. Just let me type my password directly.

&amp;nbsp;

You can tap one button to get rid of it, it literally takes a fraction of a second. I usually use numlock, so I don't forget later and get frustrated when the numpad isn't working.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; *    There are advertisements in your start menu.

&amp;nbsp;

Yeah, that kind of sucks, but you can disable them for good in less than a second.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; *    Even solitaire is changed for the worse.

&amp;nbsp;

That's not a very good reason. There are tons of solitaire alternatives, and you can even [install the old versions on windows 10](https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+7+solitaire+for+windows+10&amp;oq=windows+7+solit&amp;aqs=chrome.2.0j69i57j0l4.7039j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)

Remember when they tried to charge for mods on in an already established modding community on an existing platform? Yeah, that didn't go so well. So, they build their own platform, try it out with a new game, let it build up momentum and come out of beta... then BAM! Now they can charge for Skyrim mods with minimal uproar.

The [Death at a Funeral Remake](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321509/) is ""the black version Death at a Funeral"", because they clearly just wanted a black version of Death at a Funeral. Just like they wanted a ""female version"" of Ghostbusters.

Death at a funeral, but black, was the whole concept.

The new star wars, is just... the new star wars. Nobody cares that the new main characters are a woman and a black man, because before writing the movie, they didn't sit down and say: ""Okay we're gonna make star wars, but diverse"".

It was just Star Wars, but new. A new, better, Star Wars remake that extended and complimented the original was the concept.",2016-06-11 05:24:36+00:00,d44lz1o,11.0,t1_d44ljoq,1030.0,todayilearned

1190,"&gt; I don't like the start menu.

Classic Shell, or start10. Both low-impact on performance, integrate flawlessly into your system. 

&gt; The search bar is only able to be placed on the task bar, and not in the start menu.

1- Open start

2- Type

Boom, no reason to have the search on your taskbar. Also, have you tried small taskbar mode?

&gt; Shutting down takes 4 more steps to do with the keyboard.

If only PC's came with some sort of dedicated button for this task, so you could shorten it to one press. ^^^/s

Also how much time are you saving with 4 less presses, or just using the mouse?

&gt; The volume mixer can no longer be accessed from the volume slider and now has to be opened through your folders.

Right click the volume button, ""open volume mixer"". Or just use winaerotweaks if you want it to be one press.

1425,"I know I'm a rare case, so don't let that impact your opinion of 4j. But, yes, as ridiculous as it sounds, that is the case. I watched videos about minecraft almost every day for about a year and a half before it came out in Xbox. I was so hyped when it released. When I did play it on console, I played it literally every day. I played for about 2 years before I started getting fed up. I saw how much better the PC, and even the damn MOBILE version of the game was, and started to see how many other, similar problems there were with the console platform as a whole. Even playing PC minecraft on a shitty laptop at 15 FPS was worth it for me. Minecraft being so terrible on consoles is why I'm a PC gamer now, and I don't regret the move.

1584,"&gt; Every top comment is followed by ""No, you're wrong."" 

No... you're wrong. 

In all seriousness though:

People submit their opinion, and people with a different perspective counter that, and then the first party defends their opinion... so on and so on.

That's what a discussion is. Nobody is having a pro-marijuana circle-jerk downvote fest, people are discussing this in a polite manner, and upvoting each-other because both sides are contributing to the discussion.

[Look at this.](http://i.imgur.com/Cup5iKl.png)

Where do you see a problem? Both the parent comment *and* the response are highly upvoted. There's no problem with two people sharing their point of view in a non-threatening manner, and having a civil and honest discussion.

Second, try to keep the game as close to the vanilla experience as possible (excluding the mod you are showcasing of course.). No texture packs, no shaders, no custom maps. These things distract from the content you are trying to showcase. People are watching these to find out how the mod will work for them, so you want to keep it as general as possible. Otherwise, it's harder for people to imagine using the mod themselves.

2022,"Your gamer friends are probably recommending 7 because they are going along with the circlejerk about how much 8 sucks. They probably know next to nothing about the OS and can't see past the one shitty feature it has: the Metro Start screen. Windows 8 is so much faster, for almost everything. It boots considerably faster, it's definitely better optimized for gaming, and the start screen that people hate so much is [optional](http://www.classicshell.net). It is one of the best OSs (OS's?) I have ever used. It also has backwards compatibility, so it can run pretty much everything from Windows 7 and below. Windows 7, however, cannot run any Windows 8 apps.

Also, you get a free upgrade to Windows 10 in a few months anyway, so if you for some unfathomable reason do not like it, you get to change. 

Side note: I ran Windows 7 for 4 years, Windows 8 for 3 years, and Windows 10 for 2 months now. Windows 10 is definitely greater than 8 for gaming, but it's not finished yet so I don't reccomend it just yet.

After a while (like 10 seconds) of your player being retarded, you'll teleport into the plane. Due to the strange nature of the animation and questionable life decisions your character makes, most people assume you just can't enter the plane that way and give up before giving the seemingly brain-damaged little guy a chance.",2015-06-26 16:53:20+00:00,csjkolg,6.0,t1_csjjb1n,2052.0,GrandTheftAutoV

What /u/complex_reduction said, and also:

I own a PC and a PS4, and honestly it wasn't as hard as you would think to get into PC. Contrary to popular console gamers' belief, it's considerably more expensive to game on console than it is on PC. On average, I spend about $25 less on new PC games than I would on a console. My Library of 150+ PC games cost less than my library of ~60 console games. With things like the Humble bundle, greenmangaming, and steam sales, console gaming looks like a really, really expensive option in comparison. That being said, I still use my PS4 for the few exclusives I just can't go without, like TLOU, uncharted, etc. But yeah PC gaming is cheap.",2015-06-21 02:45:39+00:00,csdgrij,5.0,t1_cscvv8v,45647.0,AskReddit

You were wrong, Touchscreen mode DOES NOT EFFECT how you move your camera, walk, or anything in game. With or without touchscreen mode enabled, the game works the same as shown in that video. The touchscreen controls do not effect anything but the menus, and the inventory, like I said.

Uh, yeah, I did, it's like two or three replies up. I just clarified what it actually did. You said that it lets you move your player around, which is incorrect.

I don't understand. The PS4 was outdated the day after it came out; that's how consoles work. You can't upgrade or buy a new, better PS4, they're all the same (which is why I like consoles, I like simplicity). 

&gt;Also, the fact that you're comparing on-sheet specs between a PC and a fixed hardware setup with a completely different hardware architecture reeks of you being a misinformed layman who think that just because actually putting together a PC is pretty much like playing ""fit-the-shape"", that that therefore means that comparing specifications is somehow equally straight forward.

You got me there, I don't really have a good defense for that one. Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly a layman. If this argument is to continue you're gonna have to find someone smarter.

 You win, but you're being kind of aggressive for no reason. I thought we were all friends here :D

If you don't like Linux, Windows 10 is free, and windows 8 is like 20$ from some places. /r/microsoftsoftwareswap

Also, if you hate games/customization, you can get OSX for cheap.

Wat. Why? Is my PC magically going to get worse over time? Console generations last 7-10 years now, and my PS3 still works just  fine. You can keep any gaming system, PC or console, for as long as you want w/ out needing an upgrade every time a new game comes out.
