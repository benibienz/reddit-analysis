&gt; What if people who didn't have robots, wanted to trade and form their own alternative economy ?

* I think this is similar to current bitcoin. It probably would happen.

&gt; Where does 3D printing &amp; energy self-sufficiency fit into your ideas ?

* I love this question. 

 * 3D printing might tie in on a consumer level  as it is today, but on another level. Maybe, the 3-D prints are going to be on a living organic basis, or a material science basis for function. I.e. a 3-D printed: tree, hair, socks, etc.

 * I wonder on the energy self-sufficiency portion, tieing into 3-D printing maybe the ability to printout your own PV cells, batteries, etc. Future of Solidstate batteries may come into this mix as well as future of chemical structure. Maybe the future of 3-D isn't as we know it, but more on a nano-scale of binding, and chemical structures.

&gt; our economic model requires consumption; what if no one is interested or needs what the robot owners make ?

46,"You may want to try to remember more on the interval spacing from one note to another. As humans we naturally learn to recognize melodies based on the pattern we heard. The pattern we actually first recognize is the spacing between notes. Take the major scale, where ws = whole step, hs = halfstep: it is made up as: ws,ws,hs,ws,ws,ws,hs. Most teenagers can without trying whisle the major scale, because there brain has associated a pattern via the steps between each pitch. 

So it may be a good start to think of music based of the interval between pitches and associate something to each interval spacing.

Learn along the way!: How I would do my first experiement:
-associate a person to the intervals: 1/2, whole, 1.5 steps, 2 steps, etc.
-allocate a familar location that I know by heart like my house and place the people that I associated to each interval type, in the order of the music which I visualize I proceed through my house: walked in front door, walked past tv stand, walked past master bed, etc.
-That's it

Next time you need to recall a piece verbatium by ear you will have the interval spacing directly available.

Of course this is assuming you have practiced making interval jumps.

Submitted ~100 applications:

Sent Resume to ~ 20 people:

What I have seen is job applications pretty much get you nowhere, unless you have made a connection with someone in 
the hiring group or company. I started getting smart toward the end and any application that I applied for I went on Linkedin found an HR person from that company and personally emailed them. It worked too, because they usually responded, but would say something like..""I see you already put in an application, so I can't pass your resume along."" So you might want to just email the HR person and a week later apply.
Another way is to use ifttt receipes for help finding jobs.

Alittle extra advise is don't just accept a low offer because your affraid you won't get another one. I got an offer in the low 50s and a week later I got an offer in the high 60s. I refused to accept the first offer because I knew it was a low ball offer.
