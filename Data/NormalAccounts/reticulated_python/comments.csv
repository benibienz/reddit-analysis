0,"I still keep in touch with the people that formed my core group of friends throughout high school. Some others I also keep in touch with, but not as much. I see those people maybe once a year. And then there are others that I don't talk to at all. For the record, I've been out of high school for over two years now.

One thing I've noticed is that most people don't make much of an effort to initiate get-togethers with high school friends. They'll be there if you invite them, but they'll never organize events themselves. So there are 2-4 people, including myself, that plan almost every 'reunion' we have. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, but it goes to show that if you want to stay friends after high school, it takes considerable effort. It's still worth it.

1,"I didn't intend to detail every aspect of my life, but it just sorta happened. So enjoy.

Things are mostly great. I might as well start with the bad things: school is busier than I'd like. Lab exam and a lab report at the end of next week, another lab report (and a lab) on Monday, and a math assignment due in  a week. My grades are great for the time being, but they're at risk of slipping in the next couple of weeks. But I know I can do it. This time last year, I had twice as much school work.

But everything else couldn't be better. I'm really improving at piano. I have a break from music theory lessons for a week, so I can focus properly on school work. Tomorrow I'm meeting with a prof whose work I like, and we're going to discuss the possibility of me doing my fourth-year project under his supervision next year. Also, it turns out me and a good friend are both interested in each other romantically. However, we both have doubts about whether we should move forward with the relationship. Tomorrow we're likely meeting up, and we'll talk about what we're gonna do. I'm leaning towards going ahead with a relationship. But we'll see what happens. I think everything will work out alright. Oh, and I'm also talking with a good friend from high school that I haven't spoken to in a few months tomorrow. Really looking forward to that.

Some composers have had their works catalogued by others. These numbering systems can sometimes be more useful than opus numbers. BWV (which is an abbreviation for 'index of Bach's works' in German) is an example of this. The BWV catalogue is organized by type of composition; for instance, BWV 772-994 are all keyboard works. With many catalogues, the letter abbreviation denotes the name of the person who created it. For example, Mozart works are often referred to by K numbers, for KÃ¶chel, the dude who catalogued Mozart's works.

WoO is a catalogue just of Beethoven's works that were published without an opus number. The name is an abbreviation for ""works without opus number"" in German.",2016-10-27 02:37:09+00:00,d99gofi,2.0,t1_d97n5ct,103217.0,piano

17,"On one hand, everyone should get their chance at reading in class--on the other hand, it impedes progress for everyone else.

Ideally, the majority of time would be spent on group discussion, and reading bits out loud would enrich the discussion. In that case, since most time isn't spent on the reading anyways, it seems like it'd be alright no matter who reads.

But in many classes that's not the case, and then I see slow readers prevent the class from getting through the material smoothly. I didn't consider that in my previous comment.

This demonstrates an important challenge in group education: you don't want to leave anyone behind, but you don't want to slow everyone down. In my experience, a great English teacher spends more time on getting everyone to participate in discussions, which in a sense partially dodges that problem, and probably teaches the students more too.",2016-10-21 07:58:23+00:00,d91ic1b,3.0,t1_d911p5f,29775.0,teenagers

I think the automated selfie and kik threads were unsuccessful because they removed part of the social aspect of these threads. When a real person posts a social thread, posting a top-level comment is in itself a social interaction, between the commenter and poster. Child comments also serve as social interaction. In an automod social thread, only child comments provide direct social interaction. The result is that few top-level comments are posted. This is exactly what we saw over the past few weeks.

Maybe it would be good to expand this section with some of the recent discussions, or add a section on playing hands together. Just something that would further emphasize the importance of slow practice.

Also, it'd be cool to have a section on how to learn how a piano works and how to become a piano technician.",2016-09-10 01:47:50+00:00,d7ggxfq,1.0,t3_51i8hq,266804.0,piano
59,"Thank you!

I think the problem with the bar you mentioned is that up to the first beat, the chords suggest B flat minor. But then I throw in a D flat major chord, which is a III chord in b flat minor. Since the modulation isn't smooth, the A flat major chord following it feels out of place. I'll see if I can come up with something better.

EDIT: I updated my submission. See https://musescore.com/user/4153991/scores/2585986 ...though I'm not sure if this actually makes it any better.",2016-09-06 15:59:15+00:00,d7blysp,3.0,t1_d7auj0m,58621.0,MonthlyComposition

Originally, I was going to give the inner parts a more active rhythm than the outer parts, with an oscillating melody, sort of like the second movement of the Pathetique sonata or Chopin's etude op. 10 no. 3.

What determines the curvature of spacetime is the mass contained within it. You could say, matter tells spacetime how to  curve, and the curvature of spacetime tells matter how to move.

173,"Thanks! So many animals go into states of hypometabolism in various conditions. The one I'm studying is frogs that freeze in winter. Their heart rate slows to a crawl, and only the essentials of metabolism are retained. And then, once spring comes, these frogs thaw and go back to a regular metabolic state. And they can do this ridiculously fast. I'm studying how this process is regulated in the brain of the frog.

Now, there are lots of different proteins involved in freezing frogs, but I'm studying one particular histone proteins. Histones are super cool and are found in almost all eukaryotes. (Eukaryotes are those organisms whose cells have a nucleus. They all descended from a common ancestor.) The DNA in eukaryotes is wound around these histone proteins. These histones can be modified by adding and removing methyl, acetyl, phosphate, and other groups, which in turn changes how the DNA is wound around them. And if DNA is wound up differently, that impacts whether enzymes have access to it. To begin the process of producing proteins, which carry out metabolic functions, a protein called RNA polymerase (along with some others) needs access to the DNA.

So putting this all together, what can we infer? In frozen frogs, metabolism is suppressed. One way they could do this is by modifying histones to prevent RNA polymerase from accessing their DNA. So we hypothesize certain histone modifications will be found in frozen frogs that won't be found in non-frozen frogs.

Hope that makes sense--lemme know if anything's unclear. What are lab rotations?",2016-05-01 20:11:10+00:00,d2orupa,5.0,t1_d2oq3r1,2703.0,teenagers

This would be an excellent time to talk to a school counsellor, or your doctor, or a trusted parent/guardian about how you're feeling. There's a good chance that'll help you deal with things. And don't hesitate; do it now, as soon as possible, before you fall further into the cycle of not getting shit done. Running away will not solve your problems--you'll just be depressed/anxious in a different place.",2016-04-24 03:06:57+00:00,d2ez983,1.0,t3_4g61oy,9696.0,teenagers

195,"You're clearly dedicated to this--that is excellent for only seven weeks. Keep up the hard work and you will do very well. Absolutely get a teacher if you can. At pretty much every stage of learning piano, a teacher will greatly help you improve.

One thing I noticed in your video was your left wrist was a bit low, other wrist seemed good though. Also, try to bring out the melody, so those notes sing out above the rest. I'm not sure from the video to what extent you are doing this already--if you are, keep it up.

A couple of other things to do: learn to read sheet music as soon as you can. It'll make learning new pieces a lot easier, and it's basically a requirement once you get to a certain point. If you can find the time to learn a bit of music theory, do that too. It's not strictly a prerequisite for good piano playing, but it's often helpful in ""understanding"" the music you play, for lack of a better word. Also, music theory is fun.

277,"Jack Horner is the guy who started this project, and he think they'll have a chickenosaurus in five years. I'm less optimistic, but I still think it can happen within 10-20 years.

There are a few major differences that separate birds from their immediate ancestors. Going from front to back, the first big difference is in the head; birds have a beak without teeth and we need to change that into a snout with teeth. You can get chickens to grow snouts by modifying some gene expression, and it's actually pretty easy to do. It only takes some tiny changes. Chickens can also be induced to grow tooth buds, but they've unfortunately lost the genes for enamel. To get them to grow full teeth, you need to splice in the enamel genes from the closest living relative: crocodiles. But this is completely possible and similar things have been done with other genes and species.

The next big difference is the hands and the wrist. Bird fingers are fused together to support the wings (I think), but dinosaurs have unfused fingers. There's also a slight complication with the development of the bird fingers but it's kinda technical and I don't really understand it. Basically it's hard to tell which fingers in the bird correspond to which fingers in dinosaurs.

There are some differences in the hips as well. Birds exhibit some bone fusion in the hips to make a structure called a synsacrum. But the biggest hurdle is still the tail. Bird ancestors had long tails with around twenty (give or take like ten) vertebrae. Modern birds have only a few vertebrae and the tail is capped with a few fused vertebrae known as a pygostyle. The development of the tail is quite complex and really puzzling in places. But understanding it will really be a big leap forward in developmental bio.

I should say that the line between birds and not birds is not sharply defined. There are dinosaurs with fused fingers and beaks, but a long tail, and it's hard to say whether they're birds or not. But if we keep pushing this bird modification further, eventually we'll have something that everyone agrees is no longer a bird.",2016-03-21 00:55:57+00:00,d17bx0q,3.0,t1_d17ad6l,2591.0,teenagers

280,"This is a very good question. Various gases (most notably water vapour, methane, and carbon dioxide) absorb electromagnetic radiation, but only at certain wavelengths.

The sun emits radiation at a spectrum of wavelengths that peaks in the visible light region. So mainly it's visible light, UV rays, and some infrared rays that are emitted. (Other wavelengths are emitted, but not as much). Some of this is reflected by the atmosphere and some is transmitted to be absorbed by the ground. But the surface of the Earth emits radiation as well. Because its temperature is much lower than the Sun, it tends to emit mostly in the infrared region. Greenhouse gases can absorb this radiation and then emit it in any direction, including back towards the ground. So some radiation is prevented from escaping the atmosphere, because it is absorbed and reemitted to the ground by greenhouse gases. The net result is that the Earth is warmed than it would be without these gases.

This has caused global temperatures to increase at quite a fast pace. In addition, activities like logging destroy the habitats of species. These changes are occurring too rapidly for many species to adapt, and as a result a mass extinction has begun.

There have been a few mass extinctions in the past, and we absolutely should avoid a man-made one.

290,"Is revenge morally acceptable? I don't think it is.

Suppose for a moment that it was. You could write that moral principle precisely as ""it is acceptable to cause harm to another if they have previously caused harm to you"". But then the question comes up: how *much* can you harm someone in revenge? For the sake of argument let's say you can quantify how much harm something does, so statements like ""I caused you twice as much harm as you caused me"" make sense. Then we can further specify our hypothetical moral principle:

""It is acceptable to cause up to (x) times as much harm to someone as they have done to you"". Here, x could be any number greater than zero. I think this is a dangerous principle. If Alice harms Bob, then by this rule Bob can harm Alice too. But then Alice can harm Bob again, and it goes back and forth. You'd get these cycles of revenge that really don't benefit anyone, and harm everyone.

I think this is unbefitting of a moral rule, and so it shouldn't be taken as one. Also, I realize this isn't really practical advice--but eh, it's fascinating to think about *why* some things are moral and others aren't.",2016-03-16 21:17:18+00:00,d12h3wq,1.0,t3_4appop,2142.0,teenagers

If you go into politics, you will be doing tons of speaking. That covers two of your interests.

Living organisms consist of huge numbers of molecules, which means they can more or less be analyzed with statistical mechanics, and the laws of thermodynamics. But living systems operate far from equilibrium conditions, and most of the existing knowledge of statistical physics only applies near equilibrium. This is a hot area of research right now.

328,"My teacher always told me to keep interpretation appropriate to the style period, and the examiners I had always commented on whether I did that. I think the reason they ask for pieces from different periods is so you can demonstrate you have a strong command of the different styles.

This makes the biggest difference in Baroque music, which was written a long time before instruments resembled the modern piano. All pedals should be avoided in Baroque pieces. In accordance with the style of the day, the tempo should be strict (with some exceptions that I'll address) and dynamics should be ""terraced"" normally. By terraced dynamics I mean that changes in volume occur abruptly, instead of gradual crescendos. For example, if you have a sequence going on, then with each repetition of the sequence you would get louder, or softer. As for tempo, generally stay at a constant tempo, unless there's a direction to change speed or you're at the very end of the piece. Sometimes (I've seen it in a couple Preludes and Fugues) there's a brief pause before the coda, and there it's acceptable to slow down going into the final chord before the coda, returning thereafter to the original tempo.

Schubert took romanticism a step further, and as a result he's sometimes considered classical and sometimes romantic. His pieces demonstrate heightened emotion and passion, unlike the restraint present in the classical era. He also modulates pretty abruptly, and to more foreign keys than previous composers. Schubert also had a fascination with nature and the supernatural,  characteristic of the romantic era. Check out ErlkÃ¶nig and the Trout Quintet for a good example of Schubert.

Around 1810 a lot of famous romantic composers were born: Schumann, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Liszt, and probably more I can't remember. All of these composers are worth checking out. Carnaval by Schumann is really nice; I also like Chopin's Raindrop Prelude and Liszt's La Campanella.

410,"I agree with you, but this is a point that has been brought up several times. It's only natural that a subreddit for teenagers is full of (in general very similar) relationship posts, since early relationships form an integral part of many teenagers' lives. I feel we're at the stage where rather than just complaining about the issues here, we need to take action to fix them.

So what can we do? Relationship posts aren't going away anytime soon. Solving that issue is going to be the most complicated (I think). I support implementing a weekly relationship megathread, just for a trial period to see how it goes. I think it should be something like /r/piano's 'No stupid questions' thread: people aren't forced to ask questions in the megathread, but they're allowed and encouraged to. Similarly, people would be encouraged to post their relationship stuff in the megathread, but not obligated to. What does everyone else think? If there's significant support it's worth contacting the mods over.

Shitposts are the other big deal here. Is there anything we can do about this? Honestly, I enjoy them every once in a while (e.g. /u/alakul's ""MY GRANDMOTHER SAID I WAS THE MOST HANDSOME MAN"")--there's just too many of them. I believe the best course of action is to just downvote shitposts until people get the hint and stop making them so often.

Possibly influenced by Paganini's showmanship, once Liszt began focusing on his career as a pianist again, his emotionally vivid presentations of the music were rarely limited to mere sound. His facial expression and gestures at the piano would reflect what he played, for which he was sometimes mocked in the press.""

Also noted were the extravagant liberties he could take with the text of a score at this time. Berlioz tells us how Liszt would add cadenzas, tremolos and trills when playing the first movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, and created a dramatic scene by changing the tempo between Largo and Presto.""

Is it even possible to pursue two separate careers in physics and biology? My tentative plan is to flip-flop between the two. For example, this summer I'm going to work in a biochem lab, next summer I'll try to get a physics internship, then I'll do my honours project in bio, a master's in physics, etc. I'm worried that if I do this I'll just end up not being successful in either field.

554,"Well, why don't we divide this by type of organism.

Bacteria and archaea: absolutely. I don't see any ethical objection here. These are not conscious organisms. The same argument applies to protists, fungi, and plants.

Animals get a little more complicated when you get to more intelligent, conscious species. For an animal to be opposed to itself being cloned, it must have some sense of self. This is not the case for many animals, like--for example--sponges, sea cucumbers. On the other end of the spectrum we have humans, which are self-conscious. If I don't consent to being cloned, it is definitely unethical to clone me anyways. Could a chimp consent or not to being cloned? I don't know.

Suppose I did consent to being cloned. Is it ethical to clone myself? Well, the only other party that is involved here is the clone. One could argue it's not ethical since the clone may eventually object to its creation. But I could then counter, does that mean it's unethical for someone to have a child, since the child might eventually object to its birth? The only difference between the two scenarios is that in cloning, genetic material comes exclusively from one individual, but a child's genetic material comes from two people. I don't think this affects my argument at all.

So I conclude that cloning a consenting human is ethical. But to be fair, I'm really not sure why anyone would want to do that.",2015-12-09 19:32:16+00:00,cxt5x92,1.0,t3_3w33om,13640.0,teenagers

586,"I should specify that if the quadratic doesn't have real roots (i.e. it doesn't cross the x axis), then r and s will be complex numbers, which just makes things complicated and won't help you solve many problems. Also, if there is only one root then r = s and y = a(x-s)^2.

Lastly, this is actually a special case of a more general theorem. Any nth order polynomial can be written as

y = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n)

where the r_n are the (potentially complex) roots of the polynomial. You can actually apply this beyond polynomials sometimes.

638,"I only socialized a little bit until grade 8. Sort of a funny story--one day at lunch I said the word 'shit' for some reason, and then all of a sudden everyone was talking to me. Middle school was strange like that. Throughout high school I progressively became more socially confident. Back in grade 8 or grade 9, I was considered a weirdo by a lot of people, I think. At least I know I wasn't though of as ""cool"". But I had a good group of friends and I never really felt lonely until university (that's another story). In grades 10 and 11 I really started to get more involved in extracurriculars and school events which made me a ton of friends and gave me the confidence to seek out new friends. By my last year of high school, I had no issues at all.

Did people care a lot about your age? I found most people didn't care, but in many ways I was less mature than others around me and that was reflected in the way I was treated.

The biggest thing that made otherwise boring classes fun for me was having friends in class to talk to. I feel you on the mediocre teachers--a good teacher makes a world of difference. All the classes where I consistently learned had great teachers that always made sure I was challenged. I really can't tell you how much better it will get after high school--I'm sure it depends a lot on what kind of person you are and what school you go to.

But the most important thing is to keep challenging yourself, seeing as how school isn't doing it for you. That independent study thing sounds great! Keep doing that kinda thing. I guess you like physics, based on what you did for independent study. I do too. You need to keep yourself stimulated, so get a book on classical mechanics, read it carefully, and do the problems in your spare time. I can recommend books if you like--but /r/physics can probably recommend better!

Yeah, I didn't expect at all to see so many people who have skipped grades. Then again, there are over 100,000 teenagers on here, so maybe it's not all that surprising. It's not common where I am either. Other than me and my brothers, I've only ever met 1 person who was accelerated.

I attend university in Ottawa (shoutout to /r/CarletonU!) and I'm doing a combined major in bio and physics. I added minors in chemistry and math this year. I don't think being young helped or hindered me in university applications. In the end my mom didn't want me leaving home at 15 so I stayed in Ottawa.

642,"I skipped two! Well before high school, though. Anyways I think it was overall a good experience. There are downsides to it, though. Because of the age gap, dating has always been difficult. Part of that is just because I don't spend enough time meeting girls, but especially in the earlier years of high school, I had no chance with anyone I knew. That age gap becomes less and less significant over time, though. It's not thaaat much of a big deal these days. The other downside was not being as physically capable as the other students, especially in middle school. Running a 3.0 on the beep test really stinks. It probably would have helped if I was more athletic back then. Nowadays, I'm in decent shape and I've grown, so that's never an issue.

I skipped grades because I wasn't challenged enough in school. Unfortunately, I didn't find I was challenged after skipping grades, either. There are maybe 3 classes I took in high school that I feel were truly worth my time, academically speaking. Now in university, things are getting a bit more interesting, I guess. First year was a bore just like everything else. I still feel my classes are boring most of the time, but it's occasionally cool. I'm starting to think that I'll never feel fully stimulated in organized education, but I try to be optimistic. Having friends in class really helps make it fun.

I realize I've focused mainly on the negatives, so I should clarify why I still feel I've benefited from skipping grades. While I am bored in class, I'd be a hell of a lot more bored if I hadn't skipped grades. Being in a class with older people who were more mature and more capable than me in many ways served to motivate me to acquire the skills I lacked (mainly physical ability and social skills). And I'm already able to gain research experience at 17, something I've been wanting to do for a very long time.

Anyways, that's my experience. Yours might be different  of course. But if you're not feeling challenged enough, be aware that probably won't be completely fixed by skipping a grade.",2015-10-27 19:07:37+00:00,cwexaip,1.0,t3_3qeqmh,25422.0,teenagers

657,"Interesting article. I think it's good that students can opt out of dissections. Many are, with good reason, uncomfortable with cutting into a dead organism.

However the author claims that many virtual simulations of dissections are proven to work as well as physical dissections. I'm pretty sure that's not true. Virtual dissections are idealized portrayals of the real thing. In real life, anatomy is way less neater and much messier than a virtual dissection. Being able to identify structures in a virtual dissection is far simpler than identifying structures in a real organism. And being familiar with those structures--with the anatomy of a real organism, not a diagram--is an incredibly useful skill in biology, and is often necessary to pursue research in bio.

I could go on about this for ages, but I don't want to rant. It's perfectly alright to not want to do a dissection. But to claim students can learn just as much biology from simulated dissections is a dangerous lie--if that belief becomes widespread, schools might eliminate real dissectiond, which would undermine the education of budding biologists.",2015-10-22 23:14:52+00:00,cw9ftqn,1.0,t3_3ps5cy,29057.0,teenagers

676,"Hmm, maybe I can explain it. The important thing to remember is that although there is a strict structure for a fugue, Bach and others didn't always adhere to that structure. They took liberties for the sake of their art, and you can too.

So a fugue has three main sections. The opening section is sometimes called the exposition. The exposition begins with the subject, the theme that will be featured throughout the fugue, heard alone in one voice. Then another voice enters, playing the answer. The answer is just the subject transposed to the dominant or sometimes the relative major key (for example, if my fugal subject was in C minor I'd put the answer in G minor, like [Bach does here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kTErsqPtIg)). The answer can be real or tonal--in a real answer, the pitches of the subject are transposed exactly; in a tonal answer, they aren't. Tonal answers (like the one in the piece I linked) are used when you need to change the subject a little to get the harmonies to work the way you want them to. If there are more voices, they all come in gradually, one at a time, just like the first two voices did. Each of them plays either the subject or the answer when they first come in. Often, composers will throw in things called countersubjects. A countersubject is a theme that's frequently heard throughout the fugue against the subject. So when one voice is playing the subject, another voice might be playing one countersubject, and another still might be playing a second countersubject. Once all the voices have played the subject/answer once, the exposition can be ended. Or if you want to keep going you can put in redundant entries, which are just more occurences of the subject or answer. Oh, and one more thing: in between occurrences of the subject and answer, there are occasionally codettas, which are short passages that spice up the exposition and help you modulate between the tonic and dominant keys if you need it.

Next comes the middle section. While the opening section was quite strict in form, the middle section gives you a lot more freedom. The middle section alternates between subject entries and episodes. A subject entry is just when one voice plays the subject. It can be in any key you want! The middle section is the time for a lot of modulation. In the Baroque era, fugue composers tended to stick to the related keys; that is, the tonic (I), subdominant (IV), and dominant (V) keys and their relative major/minors. You don't need to stick to those if you don't want to, though. The subject entries alternate with episodes. Episodes are where you take fragments of material from the subject and countersubjects and manipulate them to make something cool. They often feature sequences--the same passage repeated progressively higher or lower. Sequences allow you to easily modulate to a new key for the next subject entry. Once you've gotten bored of the middle section, it's time to move on to the final section.

The final section consists of the last subject entry, and sometimes a coda. By this point, you need to modulate back into the tonic key. The last subject entry is in the tonic key--this confirms the tonality. Sometimes, there's a coda after this. A coda is just an additional little bit at the end of the piece that helps give it a sense of finality. The fugue should end on the tonic chord.

I think that's about all there is to fugues. If I missed anything or got something wrong, someone please correct me! I realize a lot of the concepts I mentioned might benefit from an example, so here's an [example fugue](http://www.youngcomposers.com/forum/t3239/a-crash-course-in-writing-fugues/). Also, listen to some fugues and follow along with sheet music and try to identify the different parts I mentioned.",2015-10-19 23:42:19+00:00,cw5r95g,4.0,t1_cw5oilv,4680.0,MonthlyComposition

753,"Ontario student here. I love math, and the state of math education, at least what I've seen of it in Ottawa, is really heartbreaking.

Throughout my entire time in public school, math class was my least favourite. The material was so dumbed-down, there was always tons of repeat material from last year, and I felt stifled by my teachers. Kids don't even learn integrals in grade 12 calculus anymore. I remember in grade 4 once, we learned to find the area of a triangle by drawing the triangle on a grid and counting the number of grid squares enclosed by it. That night I did some research and learned the exact formula for the area of a triangle. I used that formula on a test and didn't get any marks, because I was supposed to count grid squares instead.

That's just one example, but there are plenty of times things like that happened. It felt like I was only being taught the bare minimum of the curriculum. And if I wanted to learn more I had to figure it out myself--my teachers never helped me with that.

I see around me all the time people who don't like math. I think people would like math more if it was taught differently, if math class was able to instill a curiosity and a desire to learn in students. Now I'm not sure about this, but I think to teach any subject like that, you need a passion for both the subject itself and a passion for teaching. In my experience, most teachers loved teaching, but they didn't necessarily love the subjects they taught, especially in elementary school math and science.

My evidence is anecdotal and I don't pretend to have any of the answers to these problems, but I suspect there is a serious problem in our education system that will require big changes to fix.",2015-09-14 13:50:40+00:00,cv14bzo,2.0,t1_cv0wwmr,26090.0,AskReddit

I would say things to myself like 'would you rather play now and not be able to play properly for the rest of your life, or not play now and have the rest of your life to play.' It works better if you say it out loud in front of a mirror.

It could go in /r/musictheory, /r/piano, /r/classicalmusic, or /r/composer, but nowhere else I can think of. /r/classicalmusic has composition challenges, and they work out pretty well, but [they haven't had one since June](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/search?q=composition+challenge&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on). /r/composer is too small IMO. We've already looked at why /r/piano challenges don't work out. /r/musictheory could work though.

I don't know which of these is the best option, to tell you the truth. But if you make a new subreddit for it, make sure to advertise it in the existing music subreddits.

Another way we can encourage participation is with a flair system. /r/sketchdaily rewards users with flair for the number of challenges they've participated in, and for the number of consecutive challenges they've done. If we were to implement something similar, it would probably be best to go with a separate subreddit just for the compositions.

I read your post in /r/musictheory and I think it's a great idea. The composition challenges should somehow be integrated with teaching people how to compose though. Like I said earlier, /r/SketchDaily's 'Serious Saturdays' are a great idea. So maybe every week, we post a composition challenge. At the beginning of the post a concept relating to composition is explained. Then a piece is analyzed with respect to that concept. And then there's a challenge to compose something that incorporates the concept. I like the idea of an alternative, abstract theme here. Then at the end there's the links to composition resources.

Yeah, I'd say get in contact with /r/piano and /r/classicalmusic and see what they think, or even if they'll support a new subreddit dedicated to these composition challenges.

826,"Hope I'm not too late to this thread. I composed something for a composition challenge in /r/piano for the first time last week, and it was very rewarding. That said, there are a few reasons I didn't participate earlier, and I think they help to explain the low participation in the weekly challenges:

1) I don't know anything about composing. I've played piano for a decently long time and have studied theory and harmony, and I *still* feel lost when I sit down to compose. And a lot of people on /r/piano are quite new to theory and harmony, so you can imagine how they would feel when faced with a composition challenge.

2) Transcribing a piece I wrote is tedious. Even if I have something written out on paper, or in my mind, entering it into a program such as Musescore takes a pretty long time. Frankly, it just doesn't seem worth the effort a lot of the time. This ties in with your points about lack of feedback and people upvoting others' compositions. If I felt confident I would be rewarded with helpful feedback and karma, I would have a much greater incentive to take the time to transcribe something.

3) Lack of participation. It's a lot easier to feel comfortable doing something if a lot of other people are doing it too. As the number of people participating increases, it becomes easier to attract new people. Though it's a bit redundant for me to say the reason for lack of participation is lack of participation, eh?

I agree with your observations too. Now, how can we get more people composing? Let's look at each issue sequentially: not knowing how to compose, time required to transcribe, not thinking work is good enough to submit, and lack of participation (including feedback and upvotes).

If people don't compose because they don't know how, well why not teach them how to? Sort of like SketchDaily's Serious Saturday, periodic posts explaining basics of composition could be implemented. We could even take it a step further and have a 'Composition 101 course' series of posts.

I don't know of any way to rapidly transcribe music on a computer. So, it's necessary to provide people with that incentive of feedback and karma to get them to take the time to transcribe. So if we solve the lack of participation problem, this problem is solved too.

Imagine how much we could learn from a dinosaur. We could learn about hunting habits, how it moves, etc. And we could learn more about the transition from dinosaurs to birds.

We might actually have a dinosaur hatch from a chicken egg in a decade or so. I'm going to copy a relevant comment of mine from a few days ago below:

Maybe not, but you will probably live to see a dinosaur that isn't a bird!

The main differences between modern birds and their more recent ancestors are 1) the beak and lack of teeth, 2) the wing and arm, and 3) the short tail and a thing called a pygostyle.

Modern birds, for example chickens, are thought to possess some of the genes for the corresponding ancestral traits (teeth, a snout, reptilian arms, and a long tail), but these genes are activated in a certain way in the developing embryo, which makes a chicken become a chicken and not something else. By changing how genes are activated and at what times and where in the embryo, we could create a modified version of a chicken with the ancestral traits of non-avian dinosaurs. Jack Horner, a paleontologist, would call it a Chickenosaurus.

It turns out gene expression in a developing chicken embryo is quite complicated, but still, we will probably see a chickenosaurus within our lifetime. A couple scientists already made chickens develop snouts instead of beaks. And another found that chickens could grow tooth buds (but someone else seems to have shown that chickens don't have the genes to make enamel, which complicates things a little). The tail is really tough to figure out though. There's a great paper on the subject called From Dinosaurs to Birds: A Tail of Evolution. The precursors to the vertebra in an embryo are called somites, and somites are added at a shockingly regular rate in chicken embryos (also mouse embryos I think, but don't quote me on that). The adding of somites is related to these things called clock genes. A clock gene is expressed in an oscillating fashion: the amount of gene expression goes up and down in a regular cycle. A few of these clock genes control the addition of somites. But there's still a lot about tails we don't know.

Well, my enthusiastic rant's over now!

There's a song by the Butthole Surfers that goes 'It's better to regret something you did than something you didn't do'.

889,"If you want to look for a correlation between the number of subscribers to a subreddit and the quality of discussion on that subreddit, you'll need a metric to measure quality. What do you think would be a good way to measure quality?

I have one idea for such a metric: the number of upvotes on a post divided by the total number of votes (the % upvoted, basically). Ideally, a post is upvoted when it contributes to discussion and downvoted when it does not. Then, the ratio of upvotes to total votes is a measure of quality. But that's a pretty naÃ¯ve metric, because we all know from experience that terrible content can be upvoted significantly.

So maybe we need another metric. Number of comments per post would be one possibility, but a lot of comments do not contribute to discussion. How can we distinguish between comments that contribute and those that don't? First, we can only take comments with a score of greater than 1. The next thing that comes to mind is to only count comments that have been replied to by someone else. Maybe some combination of all of these methods would be a good measure of quality.",2015-08-01 17:38:30+00:00,cto291w,1.0,t3_3feby0,22322.0,TheoryOfReddit

You or your partner should call a doctor, see if they can help.

In addition, you seem to be really, really distressed or disturbed right now, which is perfectly fine, but it's important to acknowledge that can make thinking calmly and rationally difficult. Take some deep breaths and talk to someone you trust. Is there a parent or some other older relative you can talk to? Even if you're hesitant to talk to them because you fear they'll be mad at you, you have to tell them if you can. Someone who loves you will be above all else concerned for your well-being. And by the way, I find it's easier to tell someone about stuff like this if I look at the ground and speak in a firm, steady voice.

She actually offered to drive me to this public speaking contest when I was in her class. I wonder what would have happened if I had agreed. I was only 11 years old at the time...

Affect can refer to how someone presents their mood. For example ""The man had a flat affect"" means that the man did not show emotion visibly.

Effect can be a verb meaning to create something. For example, ""Under the pressure of a deadline, John always succeeded in effecting a well-written essay.""

979,"If you want to, you can change keys whenever you want. Modulating to a new key can add variety. But if you modulate too often sometimes it sounds unsatisfying to the ear.

Back in the Baroque era (1600-1750, when guys like Bach, Vivaldi, and Handel were around), modulation was less frequent then it is now. A common structure was to present the opening section of a work in some key, followed by the next section in the dominant (V) key, or in the relative major if the opening was in a minor key. Also common was to have the opening section in one key, then a contrasting section in the dominant key or relative major, followed by a return to the initial key.

That said, there are still lots of compositions from the Baroque with frequent modulation. Check out fugues, sinfonias, and inventions by Bach. He modulates very frequently. However, most of the time, he modulates to the 'related keys' of the initial key. The related keys are the I, IV, and V keys, as well as their relative major/minors.

Later on, towards the end of the Classical era and into the Romantic era (the 1800's, more or less), composers began experimenting more with modulation. Abrupt changes of keys were more common, and there was a greater variety of key changes too. 

Into the 20^th century, composers took modulation and tonality even further. Not only did they change keys all the time, some of them had two voices playing in different keys at the same time! This is called polytonality, and you can find it frequently in works of composers like Debussy and Stravinsky.

Then this guy called Schoenberg came along and sorta took polytonality to the next level. In polytonal works, two (or more) keys are treated as equal partners. There are two (or more) tonal centres. So what would happen if you treat every note as equal, if there is no established key whatsoever? The result is called atonality. It is really, really cool and very dissonant. If you're interested in this sort of thing, look into Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern.

Sorry if I'm rambling--I think the history is really cool, though. All of this is basically to say that there are no set rules about what you can and can't do with key changes and tonality. If it sounds good, then it sounds good. Harmony is a fascinating topic, and I'd recommend getting a book on it if you're interested.",2015-06-16 16:36:48+00:00,cs8i597,2.0,t1_cs8guam,1994.0,piano
