It's been a whole year since we started running these challenges. We've come a long way, and there's a lot more to do in the future. In addition to the September challenge, I'll also outline some changes we're going to implement shortly to the subreddit.

-----

**Main Challenge**: Write a 16-bar, binary theme following [this outline](https://musescore.com/pensive2/szymanowskis-challenge).

**Alternate Challenge**: write the saddest-sounding piece you can.

Some background information: this challenge is courtesy of /u/Barcelona_City_Hobo. See [their comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonthlyComposition/comments/4x6ml7/feedback_criticism_on_the_subreddit/d6dsq36). I quote the most relevant part below:

&gt; In 1915, Polish composer Karol Szymanowski was approached by a pupil, showing him a very ambitious piece. Szymanowski said it was awful, and challenged him instead to create a 16-measure binary theme according to a template he jotted on a paper.

&gt; He said: ""If you can complete this outline in an interesting and engaging way, it will show the full extent of your musical capabilities.""

I would strongly recommend reading /u/Barcelona_City_Hobo's comment that I linked earlier, as well as [some commentary](http://drwilliamhughes.blogspot.ca/2012/05/jarosaw-iwaszkiewicz-my-composition.html?m=1) by the student that Szymanowski gave this challenge to. I feel this is one the best challenges we've ever had, and I look forward to hearing all of your compositions! As always, feedback is greatly appreciated, either in this thread or by messaging the mods. You can submit music scores or audio.

-----

Now, the changes!

**We are opening up the subreddit to a variety of submissions.** Soon, submissions will no longer be restricted. We will still have monthly challenges, but in addition you can post  
* Composition challenges  
* Composition games (like the Two-Bar collaboration game)  
* Looking for a composer penpal posts  
Challenges and games are pretty self-explanatory. A composer pen pal is someone with whom you can share works in progress, get feedback, and share musical ideas. Since the subreddit dedicated to them (/r/composerpenpals) is dead, we're allowing posts seeking pen pals in here.

-----

But wait, there's more! **We're looking for musical ensembles that would be available to play the compositions produced in a future challenge.** If you are interested, please contact me or /u/Calebdgm. Tell us your ensemble's skill level, how many compositions you'd be willing to play, and any specifications for compositions that the composers would need to keep in mind. We're not necessarily looking for performance-quality recordings, just reading through the parts would be fine, and any feedback the musicians would have about their parts would also be much appreciated!

-----

Whoo, that was a long post.

This post is about the collaborative composition effort, and how there's been zero progress in about a month. I should have stayed more on top of things. I've been quite busy lately (full-time job for the first time in my life, and I did my grade 10 RCM exam today). I think I spread myself too thin.

So I want to regroup and try again. I have fewer things to deal with now that the piano exam is over. I also think the way I proposed organizing the collaboration wasn't conducive, so I'd like to try something a little different. How does the following plan sound to all of you?

* I make an initial post. Individuals write the beginning of the composition, which can be as long or as short as you like. These beginnings are submitted as comments in my post.
* I make a second post. Individuals choose a beginning from the previous post and continue it, submitting it as a comment. Again, your work can be as long or as short as you like.
* This continues on and on. I make posts, you continue works from the previous post, until we have complete compositions.

I'm 17 now. Around this time every year she holds an end-of-year piano recital for all of her students--I don't think there's been a single year I haven't played something.

And now I'm going to do my Grade 10 RCM exam next month, and she says she can't teach me any further than that. I'll be with a different teacher next year. So, this afternoon is the last of her end-of-year recitals that I'll be performing in. I'm playing [Claire de Lune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ip64cG7gK4) and [Waltz in E minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AauGBCVDMn0) by Chopin.

It's quite a strange feeling. I've been with this teacher my whole life, and before that she taught my brothers. She's been a major part of my life, and I've never known any other piano teachers. This recital feels like the culmination of all those years she taught me--like the climactic end of an era. But that's to be expected. What I really find interesting: after so many years, the thoughts running through my head right before I play are always the same--

*Alright, focus. Adjust the bench. Stay calm, the audience isn't trying to find mistakes. Now play, and try not to screw up!*

And it'll be the exact same thing this afternoon, or at least I think so. I still remember when my teacher had to count me in for every piece I played, including at the recitals. Now I can count myself, but in my head I always imagine her voice counting it:

*One, two, three, one, ready, play...*

The person doing the first bit of the sonata writes their part and submits it, then the person writing the second bit does the same, and so on.

I will set a deadline for how long you have to compose your part, but I won't be too strict about them (i.e., if you need an extra couple days that's perfectly alright).

The form of each movement is something that should be decided in advance. Since this is the first time I've ever tried organizing something like this, I think it's best to keep it a fairly traditional sonata. Let's say first movement in sonata form, second movement theme and variations (but this can be changed if people want to), third movement minuet/scherzo and trio, and fourth movement sonata form.

A scherzo and trio is in ternary form: it begins with the scherzo, followed by a contrasting trio, and then the scherzo returns. Here are the composition challenges for April:

**Main Challenge**: Compose a scherzo or a scherzo and trio.

**Weekly Challenges**: I'll add some in a little bit when I think of them.

These challenges are for everyone who wants to practice composing. Each month, at the beginning of the month, we will post a main challenge, something for people to compose.

The main challenge this month involves writing a composition for violin. I've been in contact with ~~/r/violin~~ /r/violinist, and (hopefully) the lovely people over there will play some of our compositions. The weekly challenges involve writing for the various sections of the orchestra. Keep in mind you don't need to do them in any particular order, and there's no minimum length. Here are the challenges:

**Main Challenge**: Write a work for solo violin.

**Weekly Challenges**:  
Week 1--Compose a short piece for string instruments only.  
Week 2--Compose a short piece for wind instruments only.  
Week 3--Compose a short piece for brass instruments only.  
Week 4--Compose a short piece for percussion instruments only.

We're gonna try something a little different this month. There will still be the month-long main challenge, but we're replacing the alternate challenge with a series of smaller weekly challenges. The idea here is if you don't have time to work on a large-scale work, you can just write a few bars (really, it can be as short and simple as you like!) to keep your streak going. Hopefully, this encourages greater participation. I'd like people's feedback on these weekly challenges. Do you like them? Hate them?

Alright, on to the challenges. A remix of a musical composition is an altered version of it, often involving adding, removing, and changing bits of the composition. The basic idea is to take someone else's ideas and reinterpret them to create something new. That said, here are the January challenges:

**Main Challenge**: Remix a submission to a previous challenge; preferably a submission by someone else, but remixing your own work is acceptable.

**Weekly Challenge**: Write a brief composition that references a theme used in a submission to a previous month's challenge.

The idea for the weekly challenge is to write something referencing a different theme each week. And remember, it doesn't have to be a masterpiece. 4 bars, 8 bars, 16 bars, and even just a melody are all acceptable. They're essentially a musical sketch or scribble. I hope you enjoy the weekly challenges--please give feedback in this thread!

Is it even possible to pursue two separate careers in physics and biology? My tentative plan is to flip-flop between the two.

To know what a theme and variations is, you need to know what a theme is, and what a variation is.

A theme is a major musical idea that is featured prominently in a piece. Yeah, I know that's not a very clear definition. Maybe [an example](http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/8/8e/IMSLP195385-PMLP01410-BeethovenAdagiocantab13edBerg.pdf) will help. That's the second movement of the Pathetique sonata. Check out the first 16 measures--that's the theme. Notice how the theme recurs a few times in the piece, modified slightly.

A variation is a statement of the theme, but modified somehow, so that the essential character of the theme is there and recognizable, but something very noticeable has changed. And a theme and variations is a musical form in which the theme is presented at the beginning, followed by a bunch of variations. Sometimes there's a coda at the end. My favourite example of a theme and variations is the fourth movement of the Trout Quintet by Schubert. [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwbWvGtaZGo) and follow along with the [sheet music](http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/6/63/IMSLP116763-WIMA.17fa-d667-4.pdf). That will give you a good feel for what a theme and variations sounds like.

Now, for the alternate challenge, the goal is to develop a theme as much as you can over an ostinato. An ostinato is basically a short segment that repeats throughout the work. It's usually heard in the lower voices, but it doesn't have to be! The piece that inspired this challenge was Ravel's [Bolero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK23BhEQVyU), so you can use that as an example. There are many, many more examples of theme development over ostinatos in music--look around and you'll find some. A good place to start is Dido's Lament from the opera Dido and Aeneas by Purcell.

That's it for this challenge. Please, give your thoughts and feedback!

These challenges are for everyone who wants to practice composing. Each month, at the beginning of the month, we will post a main challenge, something for people to compose. Often we'll try to make it something that everyone can work with, but when the main challenge doesn't suit you, there's the alternate challenge. Pieces can be submitted as a score (musescore, noteflight), and/or as audio (soundcloud, youtube). Feedback is much appreciated, and you can give it in the discussion thread, or by messaging the mods of /r/MonthlyComposition, there's also the [Challenge Suggestion Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10xeYa8NH3KhnvvLe3hJd6nsMU9bRfCxfQ_1Z4VEqjmQ/viewform?usp=send_form).

So, what we call B and B-flat, are called H and B in German, respectively. This means that in German you can spell the name Bach with musical notes. J.S. Bach (1685-1750) must have though this was pretty cool, because he incorporated the BACH (B-flat, A, C, B) motif into a number of his works. Also, Bach was a master of counterpoint, especially fugues. That's why the main challenge is to write a fugue. Thoughts or feedback, anyone?
