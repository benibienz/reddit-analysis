10,"Here are the highlights from the article: 

&gt; Filling the janitorial jobs with veterans helps the VA meet its hiring goals without intruding on a lucrative union giveaway that favors current government employees over everyone else for the majority of open positions. 

&gt; The VA is currently advertising for 3,000 positions, some seeking multiple people each. Only about 50 job ads, seeking an estimated few hundred workers, are accepting applications exclusively from veterans. And of those, all but a handful would have a returning hero trade a rifle for a mop and $13 an hour. At the same time, more than a thousand vacancies, many with no highly specialized skills required, were being advertised as open only to current civil servants.

&gt; ... the VA has become a self-perpetuating, union-backed jobs program for career bureaucrats.

&gt; [Veterans] contend managers support the status quo because they fear employees who are vets are less likely to quietly go along with sloppy practices and more likely to turn whistleblower when they witness conduct detrimental to their brothers in arms.

&gt; Richard Hill, a VA doctor for 20 years who is also a veteran, told TheDCNF that ""the leadership believes the VA exists for them and their staff. The veterans are just a nuisance. Employees, especially doctors and nurses who are themselves veterans, identify with the veterans and cause trouble. It is that simple.""

26,"Timothy’s hurried steps rang loudly in the empty walkway. He needed to speak with Dr. Schnabel as soon as possible. Ben hadn’t listened to him, but a man with a biology PhD might. At least he was hopeful after their telephone conversation earlier in the week. 

Timothy was quietly muttering to himself when two birds, both Cardinals, gently perched themselves on a handrail in the Universities open-air walkway. 

He stopped dead in his tracks. Both birds stared at Timothy. One cocked his head and chirped gleefully before flying away. The other started to hop, but before it could fly away Timothy said, “I know.” The red bird, back toward Timothy, stopped. 

“I know everything,” he continued. “All of it.” 

The Cardinal’s head snapped back and crooked to the side, immediately making eye contact with Timothy.

Timothy started to walk away, but the bird, still half a dozen yards away, hopped in front of him, squared itself up, and chirped – as if daring Timothy to elaborate. 

“Why?” Timothy pleaded. “Why won’t you tell them?” 

The Cardinal went into frenzy. Chirping and hoping to-and-fro before darting away as only a bird could. 

A moment later, as Timothy walked away he heard hundreds of birds chirping in the distance. 

Maybe that wasn’t the wisest move, he thought to himself. He shouldn’t show all of his cards at once, but he desperately needed an animal to speak with him if he wanted his thesis advisor to believe him. 

Timothy reached into his pocket and turned off his recorder. Ever since the animals went mute two years ago he had made it a habit to record all of his interactions, just in case one ever slipped up. So far, none have. 

As Timothy approached Dr. Schnabel’s office he wasn’t surprised to find that there were already a few people there. He expected that he’d have to wait during office hours, so he found a bench close to the office and began to sort through his notes. 

“Are you a friend of Andrew Schnabel’s?” asked one of the men from inside the office. 

Timothy thinking this was an odd question (and a bit rude) looked up with a rather annoyed expression.

“Something I say upset you?” asked the man, as he opened his blazer by putting his hand on his belt next to a, now clearly visible, badge. 

“What? No.” Timothy said. “What happened; is Dr. Schnabel okay?” 

“I’m detective Mckelvey,” he said. “What business do you have with Mr. Schnabel?” 

“Doctor,” Timothy said reflexively. “I’m a PhD student and I was hoping to discuss my thesis with him.” 

Timothy was now wrenching his neck to look into the office. There were several other detectives and at least two other people who were clearly University staff and clearly worried. 

“Is everything alright?” Timothy asked again. 

“Doctor” the detective emphasized “Schnabel has gone missing. When was the last time you spoke with him?” 

“A few days ago,” Timothy said. “We were discussing my thesis.” 

“And what’s your area of study,” Detective Mckelvey asked. 

“Early Biblical history as it applies to WWII and modern history,” Timothy said. Before continuing he noticed that the window was open in Dr. Schnabel’s office. Perched on the sill was a Cardinal – looking straight at Timothy. 

“I should go,” Timothy said. 

“Sir …” Detective Mckelvey began. 

“I have to go,” Timothy said insistently. 

As he turned and started to walk away the detective grabbed his shoulder. “What’s your name, young man?”  

“Timothy Perish,” he said nervously. 

The detective handed him a card, “I’ll be in touch, Timothy Perish.” 

--

Timothy was glad to finally be home. His first-floor apartment was small, but it suited him. He settled into his chair in his living-room-turned-office, pulled the laptop out of his bag and turned it on. 

Just then, Blue, his 10-year-old dog slowly moseyed into the room and laid down in the corner on his dog bed. 

“What happened to Dr. Schnabel?” Timothy asked. 

He knew Blue wouldn’t answer, but losing the beloved advice and companionship of his best friend had been hard on Timothy. Blue had been his closest friend for years, but after today’s events Timothy was beginning to wonder if he could still trust him. 

“I know you know something,” he protested. “I know V-Day was a sham, I know we’ve only got a year left. How many?” At this point Timothy was practically in tears, pleading with his friend. “How many will die?” 

Blue sighed as he stood; he was an old mutt after all. He approached the doggy door at the front of the house and looked back over his shoulder. 

“Are you coming back? Will this be the last time I see you?” Timothy asked. 

Blue took one last look at his old home and friend before heading out the door. Before he was half-out the door he stopped and Timothy heard a voice he hadn’t heard in years. 

“You should run. Run as far away as you can. Stay hidden. Don’t come back for seven years. If you do you’ll die.” 

And with that Blue ran away. 

“Blue, wait!” Timothy jumped out of his chair and started to run after the old dog, but he was already down the block.  

Timothy’s heart sank as he heard tires squeal and the crashing sound of metal and glass. 

Time stood still, his feet couldn’t seem to move fast enough. Timothy reached the end of the rural block, but Blue was already dead. 

“What happened?” Timothy screamed at the driver. 

“These birds started dive-bombing my car, I swerved to avoid them and this dog came out of nowhere! I’m really sorry buddy, it all just happened so fast.” The man said, clearly shaken. 

The man was still talking – calling after Timothy, but he was too numb to hear what the man was saying. 

What about my parents, my friends? Timothy thought to himself. He knew it wasn’t safe for him to stay at his home anymore. As he slowly walked home, Timothy reached into his pocket and turned off his recording device. 

His recording device. Timothy had just realized that he instinctively turned it on when he started talking to Blue. He had the whole thing recorded. He finally had the evidence he needed to prove his thesis. Now, if he could get to Ben maybe he could stop the massacre that he knew was about to happen. 

As Timothy approached his apartment the world started to come back into focus, and he started to hear all of the chirping around him. He looked up and saw hundreds of sparrows. All of them calmly resting on the power lines​ connected to his building. 

So, Timothy ran. ",2015-09-01 15:51:48+00:00,cun3ggl,1,t3_3j7pvp,11206,WritingPrompts

You can pick them up at 3Rivers individually to try them out. Or, you could do what I did and just put up a big backstop ;) ",2015-07-07 15:48:31+00:00,csv2bry,1,t3_3cfavg,7476,Archery

55,"I'd look for a bowyer near where you live. There are hundreds (if not thousands) of bowyers who would be happy to work with you on your first longbow. Then you know who made it, you know what to expect, and you're not buying another run-of-the-mill bow. If you have trouble finding one on Google try the guys over at TradGang or TradTalk. They're usually pretty helpful and they're really knowledgable. ",2015-06-18 12:36:27+00:00,csamdoo,1,t3_3a8vel,31870,Archery

57,"I have the [Vintage Leather Stiff Back Armguard](http://www.3riversarchery.com/Vintage+Leather+Stiff+Back+Armguard_i6131-1_baseitem.html) from 3Rivers and I love it. I shoot a longbow, so I didn't want something that looked like plastic or something that looked like it belonged with a more modern rig. However, I'm not into looking like Robin Hood either. That coupled with the fact that I have long forearms meant that I've tried out a lot of arm guards, most of which were alright, but not 100% what I was looking for. This is my newest armguard (got it some time in January or February) and I couldn't be happier. ",2015-06-18 12:23:52+00:00,csam3li,1,t3_3a7p2r,52710,Archery

61,"Rule of thumb is that every additional inch adds 5%, this translates better for a wider weight range of bows. (Conversly, every inch less subtracts 5%.) 

So, if you're adding two inches, that's an additional 10%, which translates to 3.5 extra pounds. Making your bow 38.5# @30. ",2015-06-16 13:21:24+00:00,cs8bb0c,1,t3_39ywcn,53589,Archery
