10,"&gt; Unsurprisingly a canucks fan is pretty uninformed.

Great way to get people to listen to you, just insult them off the bat

&gt; Curry isn't a great defender but he's certainly not horrible.

True! Curry is an excellent man on man defender and plays the passing lanes super well. Curry is also a solid team defender but his off ball defense is horrific and he also struggles with getting around screens.

&gt; Westbrook gets tunnel vision 

Dont have to say that twice

&gt;  but athletically he has all the tools.

True, The problem is he uses none of thsoe tools and he does *nothing* on defense, he hates playong defense and all he does is try and go for steals to start fast breaks. its pathetic the amount of effort and the lack of knowldege he has on defense

&gt; One of the reasons why Chris Paul is one of the greatest point guards in NBA history is because of his defense.

It helps but his offense makes him on of the greatest point guards ever, make CP3 a league average defender and his impact and legacy is relativly the same. His midrange, ball control and IQ are why he is great. 

&gt; Isiah Thomas on the pistons as well. 

Overrated defender, he wasn't bad but having Dumars to cover the best defender on the opposing team and having Laimbeer, Rodman, in the front court to cover up for his mistakes helped him a ton. 

His scoring and sense for the game is what made im great. He just knew when it was approprtiate to defer or to score himself. he had a feel for the game that made him great.

&gt; Stockton was an excellent defender.

Agreed but his longeveity and consistent play along with his high level decison making and playmaking while also being an above average shooter made him great 


&gt; If you think defense (at any position, really) ""isn't a big deal in the slightest"" you need to study the game more

On PG it isnt a big deal. i'm sorry but so many successful teams with bad PG defenders prove this along with the fact most of the all time great PGs and current PGs are average-bad defenders

Im not good at the game but i can at least play and have fun now which is a huge improvment 



1) Dont die

Sounds simple right? Good, because it is. Stay with your teammates and dont go running and gunning unless your team is pushing. Stay behind cover, Just dont get shot


Stay on you're side and pick enemies off, dont try and choose your gun fights, make sure the enemy is vulnerable and he dosent have a buddy waiting to get you after. **Just play the game slower**

2) You suck, me too. We can still help the team though, Heal people, **Fire at the enmy from a far to supress them, Mark enemies,** Use anti tank weapons properly, etc

3) Be aware of your surrondings, just look around and predict what happens next. Did you just see 5 teammates die and a bunch of enemies run towards your current position? Get out of there and mark them, Did you see a few noble teammates kill a group of enemies and now your team is pushing? RUN AND GET THE FLAG WITH THEM

4) Shoot where the enemy will be, not where they are

5) Once you are below 60% health. take cover until you are fully healed. the smallest shit kills you with that low of health.

Also some bad picks in that stretch like


In 2008 we drafted Roy Hibbert and traded him for jermaine o neal who did a whole lot of nothing. instead we could have drafted Serge Ibaka, Ryan Andreson, Batum, **DEANDRE JORDAN**

in 2009 we drafted Derozan which is a good pick since he ended up being the best player left after the Curry, Griffin and Hardens of the draft

in 2010 we drafted Ed Davis, not terrible but we ended up trading him in the Rudy Gay deal. Way better options could have been drafted but most of them were second round crapshoots

in 2011 we Drafted Val which sucked because we had a really big whole at SF which Kawhi Leonard would have filled perfectly. also missed on Klay, Butler, and more 

in 2012 we Drafted terrence fucking ross over Drummond because guess what... we drafted Jonas the year before so it wouldn't make sense to pick drummond..... This isnt even in hindsight, Kawhi fell for no reason in the draft and he was one of those guys people were picking to be a hidden gem in the draft and it turned out he was and Drummond was as talented as anybody n the 2012 draft and people were even saying he should have gone second overall. 


I really hate the Val pick in hindsight because had we not drafted Val i think we would have taken drummond in 2012 and [Colangelo i think would have taken Kawhi with the fifth pick](http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/233751/Bryan-Colangelo-Raptors-Considered-Drafting-Kawhi-Leonard-At-No-5)

How can you say that and be serious? You can't just say besides Lillard and McColum our two 20+ ppg guards who can they rely on to score. 



Portland has the better PG, SF, PF and bench. And one of the 5-8 best coaches in the NBA 



Houston has nobody. 

Harden is their only above average offensive player. They have no starting qualiber PG or PF.

Dwight is barley or maybe not even a top 10 center anymore. 

Ariza is a bottom 10 starting SF in the league. 


Their only worthwhile bench players were Capella

Shaq would be able to eat them up on offense but he would be a even bigger liability on defense. The Warriors ability to force centers into guarding the perimeter is amazing and Shaq would be helpless on D.


Iggy. Klay, Dray could all contain Kobe (Especially '01 Kobe) and the Warriors bench poops on the Lakers bench.


I don't think the '96 Bulls have many ways to try and slow down both Kobe and Shaq. 




Lakers against '96 Bulls would probably be like 4-2 Lakers 


Against the Warriors I imagine it being 4-3 Dubs

He gets player to play to their Strengths and somehow has a team of role players with differing skillsets to almost 50 wins this season 


I simply think Stevens is a better coach than spo 



If you want to base coaches off results you have to look at rosters, Front offices, owners, etc.

Spo has always had the advantage on all those fronts. 


If there was an NBA fantasy draft and before any team could pick players they had to choose a coach and i chose Stevens over Spo would you be this upright? Probably not

* Heat are low because i don't trust their health. 

* I dont like the Bulls roster if im being honest and i just dont think they are as good as people think

* Raptors stay about the same

* Wizards continue how they played in the playoffs and gain 5 wins

* I dont think the Bucks are that good. they have awful perimeter shooting and rim protection and people are too quick to jump the gun on the Bucks

* Cavs have injury problems off the bat so that's why i say 56

* Rockets are too deep and good to not be fantastic in the regular season

* Clippers stay the same i think their starters regress a bit and their bench improves a bit

* Grizzlies are treading water, everybody is getting better and they stay the same

* Warriors wont have such little injury problems like last year so 60 wins

Dellevedova was fantastic for the first 4 games. 

Mozgov was great throughout and even posted like a 30 point game.




The bench for the Cavs was terrible but I'm not convinced the starting lineup played as well if not better than if Love and Kyrie were playing. Guys stepped up and the only reason people trash LeBrons teammates is because of name recognition.

And Lavine shows hints of excellence but he is still an unknown while Giannis looks like the real deal at only 21, Jabari has shown signs of hope in the past month and Middleton is still young and is a great 3 and D player could probably be as good as Klay

3414,"&gt; Back when WoodysGamerTag was allegedly making six figures a month from a Minecraft server he ran, some kid gave him a $10k donation, using his parents credit card or something like that. Despite him making as much as he did, Woody's sole intention was apparently to ruin this kids life and to do as much damage as possible. Yeah the kid fucked up and did a shitty thing, but did he deserve to have his life ruined for it? At that time, Keem openly spoke up against Woody and gave no fucks about the fanboys' backlash and defended the kid.


Good to know you didn't know shit from that. That kid didnt accidentally do anything. So lets star with ""kid"" you make it sound like he was a 9 year old that didn't know people cant blow money it was a 15 year old and at 15 people know that you cant just spend money like that without permission.Next is that you make it seem like a one time purchase it was months and months of the 15 year old spending 5 dollars here and 10 dollars there on the server. Woody was mostly playing around with the jail thing but Keemstar didn't care and used that as a headline because it attracts hate to woody and keemstar hates woody. Woody didnt even press charges. he just ot in contact with the 15 year old's parents and the parents were on woody's side . Next just because Woody was making good money you cant let people steal 10k from you and set a precedent allowing people to do that, If i stole 5 thousand dollars from you would you let that go? No of course not. 



So a 15 year old who spent 10k over the course of a few months and even sponsored a full episode of PKA (took the money back on that) of money that wasn't even his, it was his parents deserves to be let go because woody was in a good financial situation?

just move on to everybody involved. Whiteboy also isn't very good at handling situations like this, he sounds like a 11 year old trying to make a point.

But im not ready to say who is the ""bad guy"". Whiteboy and Woody simply dont seem like malicious people. I wont blindly hate whiteboy like the rest of you guys will but this is a losing situation for woody. 



This will just get worst. Keemstar will pick up on it and side with whiteboy since Keem and Woody don't like each other and Whiteboy and keem seem to be friends and unfortunately Keemstar is becoming a giant channel and this whole thing should die soon or woody will have a nice big hate wagon following him

3983,"I thought the world of Skyrim was much better and more dense

Better enemies and combat is indisputably much better in skyrim than Oblivion.

The dungeons in skyrim were amazing and looked fucking great


The dragons and shouts added a whole new layer of fun to the game

People dont like saying it but graphics do matter especially for triple A games and Skyrim due to being 5 years older looks much much better

Much better UI and map

The DLC imo was far better in skyrim

and buying multiple homes and getting married was cool and then you could build your own house.

I actually liked the main story of skyrim more than oblivion buts that's just opinion. 

Becoming a werewolve and Vampire was incredibly fun and a viable way to play in skyrim.

&gt; This has been a great first quarter of the season. Sure the West is top-heavy and the Lakers and the 76ers are... struggling.

&gt; The east is stronger than it's been in a long time and at first glance it seemed like they were even stronger than the west, but as of right now, other than matches that include 4 or 5 certain teams (Warriors, Spurs, Lakers and Philly, and maybe OKC), I couldn't definitively tell you the outcome of any game.

&gt; Every night has the chance for overtime, and there've been a lot of games that have gone to overtime. I don't know much about stats, but it seems like more than usual. Could just be recency bias.

&gt; There are 15 teams between a win ratio of 0.4 and 0.6 with three more at .609 (Hornets, Pacers, Heat).

&gt; There are 12 teams with between 13 and 15 wins, 9 of which have 14 wins (Bulls,Mavericks, Grizzlies, Hornets, Pacers, Heat, Celtics, Pistons, Hawks ).

&gt; TL;DR - The NBA doesn't need Bernie Sanders. The middle class is strong. Warriors are the 1% and Philly has a few subprime loans.

* Heat are low because i don't trust their health. 

* I dont like the Bulls roster if im being honest and i just dont think they are as good as people think

* Raptors stay about the same

* Wizards continue how they played in the playoffs and gain 5 wins

* I dont think the Bucks are that good. they have awful perimeter shooting and rim protection and people are too quick to jump the gun on the Bucks

* Cavs have injury problems off the bat so that's why i say 56

* Rockets are too deep and good to not be fantastic in the regular season

* Clippers stay the same i think their starters regress a bit and their bench improves a bit

* Grizzlies are treading water, everybody is getting better and they stay the same

* Warriors wont have such little injury problems like last year so 60 wins

5033,"Some real unpopular opinions that yet downvoted whenever i say them i will probably still get hate in this thread


- Wilt is the only player from the 50s and 60s NBA that would be a starting caliber player in the NBA today. (All star too) sports evolve and pioneers of the sport are always the worst. But Wilt is like if somebody grabbed an all star center and put him in a super weak era. Its kind of like if you put Barry Sanders on the 1919 Chicago Bears. He would be so ahead of his time he would dominate and that's what I think Wilt did 


- The difference between Wilt and Russell is like the difference between Hakeem and Tyson Chandler. Wilt was just a far better player i think. Bill Russells pace adjusted stats for the 60s era is 12-12 on less than 50% shooting and less than 60% FT% and this is in one of the weakest eras ever

- Kobe in his peak was better than Peak LeBron or Duncan 

- Phil Jackson isn't the best coach ever. Pop is

- '15 Warriors were better than the '13 Heat and '14 Spurs 

- Anthony Davis will never be the best player in the NBA

- Curry is the best player in the NBA (May not be unpopular anymore) But LeBron isnt second i think Durant is 

- D'Angelo Russell will be the third best player from the draft (Behind KAT and Porzingis) even though people are calling him a bust already

- Bulls should just blow up their team keeping Butler and some other young guys but get rid of Noah, Gasol, Rose, Etc because their roster isn't working as it is and their only getting worse 

- Basing greatness off rings is one of the most flawed things NBA fans do 

- Kobe game did age well. He just got the worst injury in sports at an old age and if he stayed healthy he would still be an all star (a deserving all star not fan voted) 

- LeBrons Last years performance in the finals was worse than in '12, '13 and '14 ",2015-12-11 17:36:25+00:00,cxviuai,1.0,t3_3we473,4640.0,nba

Curry is winning MVP this year and Durant has been fucking incredible this year so i think he will be a runner up


I think Durant has another '14 level season and Thunder win 60+ games plus voter fatigue put Durant ahead of Curry

I think Pacers will put some nice pieces around PG in the next few years so they can get in the late 50 win column and he puts up career numbers of like 28-8-5 on high efficiency with continued elite defense and KAT for second because i think the wolves  will be really good in 3 years. Year 3 is when most young players breakout and seeing how good KAT is already i think he can put up 25-12-3 and DPOTY level defense on a top 3 seed wolves team that has year 4 Wiggins as the best second option in the NBA

5217,"Curry has an MVP, and barring injuries i have never been more sure the warriors will repeat and curry will win MVP as this year. 


That puts him at 2 titles and 2 MVP's and like 4 all star appearances. before he turns 28



Lebron averages 25 on nearly 15% less TS% (Fucking giant difference) while Curry is averaging 32 without playing 4th quarters on like i said before 15% TS% (70%) they average about the same assists and LeBron only gets 2 more rebounds a game despite the huge size difference.


LeBron is one of the most frustrating to watch defensive players in the NBA. he has the ability to still be elite on defense but he simply doesn't try on D anymore and hasn't for 2 seasons now while Curry has been getting better and is one of the best in the NBA at getting steals which usually leads to points (extra 4-9 points a game based of his defense)

Shadows of Evil is the second worst map  in zombies history

- This place loves easter eggs but the matter of the fact is that most people who play zombies don't give a damn about the easter eggs and it feels really forced this time. Its good that its their for the people who want to do it but it feels kind of forced 

- It takes too long to have fun. Zombies has always had that set up but it usually lasted like 10 minutes but in this map it is a 40 minute ordeal before you can actually start killing zombies and having fun and you make the smallest of mistakes with not being quick enough with your beast mode to open everything or getting hit 3 times in 2 seconds because zombies hit too fast and you cant buy quick revive right away because you need to save every last point so you can finish PaP early before the margwa comes so you can be in a good position going forward. Its not supposed to be a chore its a game

- 95% of people will never get swords because its just a stupidly complicated process. 

- If you cant learn a map from naturally playing it their is a fatal problem with the map and thats the case here.

- Too many *other* zombies at a time.  Their should never be R.A.P.S, flying bugs and a Margwa with zombies chasing you at one time. 




Its a shame they ruined this map will such mind blowing laps of judgement because the WW is amazing and the environment and setting is incredible but they turned a great map into an awful map with all the chores i have too do ",2015-11-17 19:24:43+00:00,cx3lzfw,1.0,t3_3t6ozm,4392.0,CODZombies

* Heat are low because i don't trust their health. 

* I dont like the Bulls roster if im being honest and i just dont think they are as good as people think

* Raptors stay about the same

* Wizards continue how they played in the playoffs and gain 5 wins

* I dont think the Bucks are that good. they have awful perimeter shooting and rim protection and people are too quick to jump the gun on the Bucks

* Cavs have injury problems off the bat so that's why i say 56

* Rockets are too deep and good to not be fantastic in the regular season

* Clippers stay the same i think their starters regress a bit and their bench improves a bit

* Grizzlies are treading water, everybody is getting better and they stay the same

* Warriors wont have such little injury problems like last year so 60 wins

* Raptors stay about the same

* Wizards continue how they played in the playoffs and gain 5 wins

* I dont think the Bucks are that good. they have awful perimeter shooting and rim protection and people are too quick to jump the gun on the Bucks

* Cavs have injury problems off the bat so that's why i say 56

* Rockets are too deep and good to not be fantastic in the regular season

* Clippers stay the same i think their starters regress a bit and their bench improves a bit

* Grizzlies are treading water, everybody is getting better and they stay the same

* Warriors wont have such little injury problems like last year so 60 wins

Name 5 things that ruined MW3 i dare you. In MW2 you had Commando, One man army noob tubes, Insane amount of hackers every lobby, Stopping power was a must have perk. And thats before i even get to the weapon imbalance. The ACR and UMP was so much better than every single gun by such a large margin but nobody ever noticed because MW2 had so many other glaring isses 

Same thing with cod 4. Whenever people say that we should make games like cod 4 again its insane.  



People would wonder why they ever praised the three kill streaks setup 

people will wonder why they forgot about Fragx3 and how utterly annoying it was. Hell i still have a fragx3 T-shirt that blametruth was selling like 7 years ago.

People get to remember how they only get 2 perk slots because if you don't have Stopping power then say goodbye because you are fucked.

Oh and i hope they keep the gun balance the same and you think people complained about the black ops 1 Famas or MW3 Akimbo FMJ9s just wait until people get a hold of the M16 again. it was a death ray.

People love the spawns because they were consistent....until they got spawned trapped. there has never been an easier game to spawn trap than in cod4

Lets add to the fact that killstreaks from your previous life count towards you next lifes then after one 7 kill streak if you are playing TDM you just won the game right there. 

You get a 7 kill streak then die. now you respawn and call in the Attack Heli which usually gets you 4-6 kills enough for a UAV almost every time and usually an airstrike. with the predictable spawns you place that airstrike and its an easy 2 kills and you get another Attack heli. 


Rinse and repeat 



COD4 was so utterly broken but people forget because its the first cod they played and have massive amounts of nostalgia about it

If it weren't for name recognition he wouldn't have even been nominated yet. 



Dirk is old and slow he is at this point arguably the Worst defensive and rebounding starting big man in the NBA 

He was still solid offensively at times last year that made us remember why he was a former MVP but age has caught up wit him badly. and we are adding yet another year to him this season.

Literally every time people say Melo is better at scoring then Durant they never bring out the numbers because Durant straight kills him in almost ever category. 

Melo in theory is better than Melo in reality. 


Carmelo's best season he averaged 28.7 PPG on .560 TS% in the -12-13 season

Durant averaged in 13-14 32.0 PPG on .635 TS%

hell even last year in 30 games coming off an injury Durant put up 25.4 ppg on .633 TS% and people were saying he was playing badly.

People will wonder why they ever praised the three kill streaks setup 

people will wonder why the forgot about Fragx3 and how utterly annoying it was. Hell i still have a fragx3 T-shirt that blametruth was selling like 7 years ago.

People get to remember how they only get 2 perk slots because if you don't have Stopping power then say goodbye because you are fucked.

Oh and i hope they keep the gun balance the same and you think people complained about the black ops 1 Famas or MW3 Akimbo FMJ9s just wait until people get a hold of the M16 again. it was a death ray.

People love the spawns because they were consistent....until they got spawned trapped. there has never been an easier game to spawn trap than in cod4

Lets add to the fact that killstreaks from your previous life count towards you next lifes then after one 7 kill streak if you are playing TDM you just won the game right there. 

You get a 7 kill streak then die. now you respawn and call in the Attack Heli which usually gets you 4-6 kills enough for a UAV almost every time and usually an airstrike. with the predictable spawns you place that airstrike and its an easy 2 kills and you get another Attack heli.

&gt; This is everyone's favorite question, and let me lead off by saying I HATE PLAYER RANKINGS. Context matters so much in terms of player value, and the measures we have are so inexact that the only things you can be sure of are completely uninteresting. LeBron James is better at basketball than Carmelo Anthony, but we didn't really need analytics to prove that, did we?

To answer your actual question,**USG/Efficiency, on-off plus minus splits, some sort of box score aggregate (PER/BPM whatever) and a RAPM-style number all come into play, but they have to be combined with a more qualitative understanding of a players' role and other circumstances - is he hurt? Being asked to do too much? Being used poorly by a coach? In the perfect situation to succeed? All of those factors have a huge influence on the statistical output of a player, regardless of the metric(s) chosen.**


This is in response to ""Whats the best stats to rank players""

There is enough footage of guys like Magic, Bird, Jordan ,Hakeem, etc to watch them play. give some of there stats some context and do some research on them to make a proper evaluation on how good they really were.

There is nothing as awesome as watching your favorite team to win a championship and nothing more crushing to see them lose late in the playoffs


I got to see my favorite NFL team New Orleans win the super bowl in the '09 season and it was amazing. Seeing the team you watch every game of and support finally hold that trophy is incredible

And the last thing i want is the crushing disappointment of seeing your team lose late in the finals. My favorite hockey team the Canucks lost in the final in a game 7 after they had a 2-0 lead in the finals and that game 7 loss crushed me. i stopped watching hockey for a few seasons.



It would be awful to consistently have hope that your team is good and can win it all only to fall short and never do it. I'd rather see the Raptors hold that trophy because i could always remember that team, remember that season and even though they would has 20 straight 20 win seasons there is enough other interesting teams in the NBA to keep me watching and still loving it. losing deep in the playoffs every year would make me hate the NBA

Do we discredit the 07 Spurs? In round 1 they faced a pretty easy Denver team. Then the #1 seed Mavs were eliminated so that made the path to the finals even easier. then they faced in the second round the suns who in game 5 didnt have Amare or Diaw. Than a Jazz team who didn't have a good bench or a starting quality SG. Then obviously the finals when they faced Lebron and scrubs.

And winning 2 more games wouldn't change that for me 


MJ was scrutinized at the time. Before his first ring people were saying to Jordan what people were saying to Lebron

""He cant win a title""

"" doesn't have ""it"" ""

But Jordan proved them wrong and beat the pistons and eventually won 6 NBA titles in 8 years just crushing the league  


And if lebron and the cavs had to face the bad boy pistons in '07 Lebron woudnt have made the finals.
