**What is this series?**

 
* In this a weekly series where i will choose a borderline Hall of Fame Player, Coach, Referee or Team to make an argument whether or not they should be in the Hall of Fame.

* I am going to list notable stats and accolades that can be used as a  reason why or why not a player should be in the Hall of Fame. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Rules**

* **Serious responses only**

* Try and make an argument for why and why not _____ should be in the hall of fame. If you can only make an argument for one side than please give extra reasons on why you said whether or not they should be in the Hall.

* If you are using off court reasons on why somebody should be in the Hall of Fame than elaborate on what they did. Dont just put ""____ had a big influence in europe"" Explain what influence they had.

* Never say ""He wont get in because the voters don't like him"". That isn't the point of this series.

------------------------------------------------------------------
A bunch of the comments end up being crappy like ""Because that team sucks thats why they wont win"" or ""Because LeBron will stop them"" instead of something like whats below

--------------------------------------------------------------



**Spurs**

**Why they will win**

- The new addition of Lamarcus Aldridge and David West far outweighs some of the depth they lost in Baynes, CoJo, etc

- Pop is still the best coach in the NBA and will get this roster to play to the best of their abilities

- Tony Parker only had a down year last year and will come back to normal this season

**Why they wont**

- Spurs finally get ""old"". Duncan just looks exhausted every time he gets to the floor, Parker continues to play like he did last season. And Ginobili and West just prove they are too old to be solid contributors on a Championship team

- Kawhi doesn't take that next step to super stardom like people are expecting 

- The new roster overhaul leads to chemistry issues similar to the 12-13 Lakers which prevents them from ever being true contenders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
^ That is how the comments are supposed to look.
