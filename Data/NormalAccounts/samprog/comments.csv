You can be whoever you want to be and don't worry, in a few years everything will change, you've got your whole life before you!",2016-09-16 08:52:33+00:00,d7p06cq,1.0,t3_52zmyg,26036.0,socialanxiety

My parents got divorced when I was 4, so every second weekend I'd go visit my dad. My dad found a girlfriend a year after that and they moved in together in a house. Because they were lacking rooms, I had to sleep in the same room as them, on a pull-out couch.

I went to sleep earlier than them everytime, because I was a kiddo around the age of 6. The little rebel I was, I often stayed up late and read or played on my gameboy. I'd go to sleep as soon as I heard them coming upstairs and fall asleep at the same time with them.

One night they went to bed and I heard a few more kisses than usual. Also the sheets were moving more than usual. Basically they had subtle sex as I was in the same room. Heard moaning and everything. Of course they thought I was sleeping, but damn, why do you do this?!

We're swiss, so she told me they're ""truube"" which, of course, means grapes. What I understood instead is ""drooge"" which is ""drugs"".

194,"Bit late, but I once got banned from a swimming pool in a wellness hotel in Austria.

Probably was around 14/15 that time and my dad took me and my sister (17/18 at the time) to a wellness hotel. The room was awesome since it was a emperors suite (big ass suite) and the hotel had everything to relax properly. There was also this awesome swimming pool where you could swim indoors or outdoors (connected).

Now since I was 14/15 and we stayed there for a week, I got bored pretty quickly and decided to try out everything there is. My dad and my sister were in the town shopping, so I went to the gym (cause why not). After a workout that lasted maybe 10 minutes (I was a pretty impatient kid), I went for a swim.

Since I wasn't tired at all from the workout and I like some Action, I jumped in repeatedly and trained my plunge dive. There were some other kids too, but the unsocial thing I am, I never met them. One of them was even wearing the same swimming shorts!

So after some time of me jumping in repeatedly, the pool attendant furiously ran up to me and banned me from the swimming pool for jumping in, since this was my second warning and a *wellness* hotel...

I never received a warning before but quickly left to the room where I played video games until my family returned.

So what happened, the boy with the same swimming shorts as mine got warned and I got banned :/

\^most educated answer right there. /s


Edit: okay I looked it up because it bugged me. The best answer I could find:

---

The filter will filter a small amount of THC out but not because of the actual filter...let me explain

Marijuana has 4 times as much tar/resin in it as a cigarette, not to mention is usually has more water in it than tobacco in cigarettes.  Those two traits cause for the filter to become clogged pretty quickly.  The tar/resin runs into the filter creating less volume for airflow through the filter.  The tar, filling a lot of the pores in the filter, also creates some surface area and even channels where smoke which passes over or through the tar in the filter will then collect (a very small amount) of THC.  When you add water vapor into the equation and are smoking higher quality aromatic buds you may find that you get less flavor (or terpenoids) in the smoke which has been ""filtered""

All that being said, the amount filtered would be miniscule and not noticeable.  I personally use crutch paper (paper rolled up into a filter) so that I don't get the above mentioned tar/resin on my fingers from smoking a joint with cigarette filters.

Also the fact that weed is illegal creates a huge stereotype in society. Just to think about it, the media in the states has been way more positive about weed after legalisation. Also it got socially accepted really fucking fast (or from what I hear).

I dreamt I was at the house of a girl I like. She was on the computer in her brothers room and I was laying on the bed, browsing Reddit (I even dream of reddit). We were talking and she says, she misplaced her phone, so I'm kinda looking around, but don't find it.

So far, we were alone in the house. Her best friend comes along and we just talk about bullshit and I kinda flirt my way through it and have fun while doing it. Her parents come home as well, and they are pissed. They somehow know me (never seen them before) and greet me friendly by name, like parents would greet guests. They scold the girl for whatever reason and the three of us go into her room.

She complains again, that her phone is missing, so I call it. It rings literally an inch from her bed and she finds it.

There happened more, but nothing sexual or anything. Just more talking and flirting. Can't really remember.

That's all, but it gave me a warm feeling.

I like this booklet/album because it gives a proper etiquette or just some tips. Also it is really good for giving advice.

I don't follow it completely, but keep it in my head.

For example, Rule of thumb #5. It advices you to give the first hit to the left. ""Give the gift of green"". We in our little stoner circle always give the first hit to whoever built the joint or filled the pipe and the second to the one that donated the weed.

Also it's a good starter for beginners. The first time I lost my lighter, I got really upset. Now I know #19: ""[Lighters come and go""](http://potshotcomic.com/11/).",2016-01-27 12:47:07+00:00,czdrk66,2.0,t1_czdrcd4,643.0,trees

When you're gay on the other hand, people think it is something special. You have to come out first and maybe will be treated subconsciously differently.

It's similiar to smoking weed.

1486,"1st off, I play a lot of video games, though I wouldn't see myself as a loser. Also it's something pretty harsh to say for someone who doesn't know me or any other meant person.

Gaming as a hobby isn't dumb, it improves a lot of useful things for life. Just to list a few; teamwork, handling stress, communication...

And the list goes on. I'm sure you're able to find an article online if you're interested.

And why do friends that only exist online don't count?

I've met some of my best friends online, some of them I have never seen in real life. It's like when you're in a football team and your teammates don't count as friends. You play games with them and maybe talk about some private stuff too.

Sir, as sorry as I am, but open up your mind, this is 2015.

Also I wouldn't talk about E-Sports being dumb and players to be losers when compared to regular sports. 11 man trying to get a ball into a net, while trying to fool the judge by falling to the ground and whining like a bitch when touched a little isn't really a ""top of the career moment"". Or is it?

And the fans after their team lost a game going crazy and vandalizing everything that comes in their way? Definitely not an E-Sports scenario.

See everyone has their own opinion, now you just have to learn to deal with it. I don't say every football player is a loser, I just don't like football. It's their choice what to do in life.",2015-11-04 04:37:51+00:00,cwntbcr,6.0,t1_cwnjkoa,15843.0,AskReddit
1487,"Hearthstone is a very technical game and needs a lot of research, knowledge and extreme predictions. Also there is a lot of randomness to it. It can happen, that this can be very boring to watch.

Me personally, I love to watch Hearthstone tournaments, simply because I'm interested in the decisions they take, what cards they play and of course, how the players skill level is compared to each other.

Also tons of tournaments are carried out in a public setting. Just look at League of Legends. There are even public viewings.

In hearthstone specifically, there is no point in being in an arena/stadium. It is much more confortable if you can participate from home. But there are of course also tournaments, which require the players to be on premise.

To the neckbeard: Since I assume that this is Noxious, I can only say that he's a funny guy with a lot of knowledge of the game. I would describe something else as a neckbeard.",2015-11-04 04:27:10+00:00,cwnsz0j,4.0,t1_cwnn4hz,9692.0,AskReddit
1488,"Well, there are also tournaments and team matches, not only streamers. So there you can also see 2 teams of dudes playing against each other, competing to be victorious.

To the donation-thing: On twitch for example, there are 2 types.

1. The subscription, which allows you special benefits (bigger chance in giveways, subscribers-only chat, different emojis, maybe a subscribergame with the streamer)

2. The donation, which is just a nice gesture. When you enjoy a stream very much and get entertained for quite a while, you maybe get the urge to basically ""tip"" the streamer. Also it allows you to communicate better with the streamer, since donationtexts are a higher priority over the chat, which gets spammed quite fast.

Also most donations get read on stream, so you get to feel important as your message is getting delivered to a few thousand people.

Donations like these allow some streamers to live of it too. It's kind of comparable to tipping a server, only that it isn't obligatory.

But as you said, you can of course choose not to donate or not to subscribe.",2015-11-04 00:06:53+00:00,cwnjb0t,4.0,t1_cwnib1i,1567.0,AskReddit

He probably has more friends than you, since he interacts with at least 9 other players per game (CS:GO as example) and believe it or not, pro players do actually have a private life.

My idol is Pazsabiceps. This dude is trained hard and has a wife and a kid. Also he's a funny guy that entertains thousands of people daily on stream.

Also I don't idolize a pro player for who he is, rather for what he can do. So I try to improve my game to match his. That has nothing to do with how fat he is or how many friends he has.

Let's just say you're a big fan of metal and love the community as well as the music itself, of course.

Suddenly, a house fan comes up and tells you that house is also music, which is according to definition, true.

You, as a metal fan, don't like the fact that house is allowed to call itself music.

1780,"a ""bit"" late, but here we go;

Characters:

Tom Tailor, Teacher 1

Frank Chadwick, Teacher 2

Lissy Crawford, Student 1

Trevor Adams, Student 2

Timothy Butler, Principal

---

It's parents meeting day in the little school of Chester. Since there are not many rooms, Mr. Tailor and Mr. Chadwick were assigned the same one.

Usually this wouldn't be a problem, but Mr. Tailor can't stand Mr. Chadwick because he slept with his wife. So as the two entered their room, they couldn't believe their eyes. Mr. Tailor ran immediately to the principal while Mr. Chadwick slowly seats himself into the first teachers chair.
Mr. Tailor comes back alone with a slightly defeated look on his face. ""Mr Butler said there is no other way."", he muttered.

""God damnit Frank, did you need to take my seat? You know it's my favorite!"" Mr. Tailor was getting visibly pissed.

""Calm down Tom, we can share it."" Mr. Chadwick answered with a smug on his face.

Mr. Tailor was not pleased about that answer. He just absorbs it and sits down in the chair opposed to the first one.
It is a long room with two desks on each end, so the parents meetings shouldn't bother each other.

As the students with their parents appear, both teachers put on their annual pokerface and carry on with the meetings.

Mr. Chadwick has a generally loud voice, so everytime he speaks about his student Trevor Adams, Mr. Tailor gets distracted by this penetrating voice stinging in his ears.
As Mr. Tailor talks to the mother of his student Lissy, Mrs. Crawford, he starts to raise the volume of his voice just for parts of his conversation.
""Mrs. Crawford, Lissy sometimes just won't **be quiet** and that can easily **distract** other students.""

As Mr. Chadwick counters: ""Mrs. Adams, sometimes there are people that just don't fit into something. Like they just aren't meant to be where they are, not meant to be doing what they are doing. That can be a relationship or a lesson in class. Now Trevor has had problems with geography, right? Maybe he just isn't meant to be connected with this matter.""

Now Mr. Tailor just loses it. He stands up and screams at Mr. Chadwick. ""**YEAH, WELL MAYBE SOMEONE** isn't meant to be in someone elses **BED** as well! Have you thought about **THAT**? What if there is a **LINE** that can be overstepped?""

Both families gaze in shock. Even Mr. Tailor himself is surprised, but still cooking with anger. ""**WHAT IF** your wife had other preferrences than an old cuck?"" Mr. Chadwick answers.

""Then **WHY** the **HELL** would she choose you?!""
""Because I'm the one that pleases her, Tom, at least **I** can say she enjoyed it!""

""**HEY!**"", Mrs. Adams interfered. ""what the **FUCK** is going on?!""

""Well apparently Mr. Chadwick slept with Mr. Tailors wife."" Mrs. Crawford answered.

Trevor took Lissy and they stormed off to get Mr. Butler.

""This fucker slipped into **MY** bed when I took over **HIS** classes!"" said Mr. Tailor

""Why don't we all sit down and talk about this?"" suggested Mrs. Crawford.

Mr. Tailor is having nothing of it. He storms at Mr. Chadwick and pins him down. Mr. Tailor is on top of Mr. Chadwick, hitting him with rythmic, strong punches.

Mr. Chadwick screams: ""**YOU'RE HITTING LIKE YOUR WIFE IN BED, TOM**""

""**FUCK YOU**"", anwered Mr. Tailor

""**I DON'T HAVE TO, YOUR WIFE DOES IT ALREADY**"", answered Mr. Chadwick.

""**FUCKING HELL**""

""**THAT'S WHAT SEX WITH YOUR WIFE IS LIKE**""

""**STOP IT ALREADY**""

""**THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE SAID**""

Finally Mr. Butler stepped in. ""**HEY! QUIT IT YOU TWO**"", he screamed as he pulled Mr. Tailor off of Mr. Chadwick. Mr. Chadwick looks fairly injured, but he once again has a smug on his face.

If you've read this far write me ""potatosalad"". Mr. Tailor gets suspended and his wife leaves him. She marries Mr. Chadwick and live happily ever after.

THE END!

We were discussing furiously about something irrelevant and he was picking the bud apart with his fingers. I even watched him do it and was amazed how he would line up the bud on the tray I provided.

2019,"The end of fights, the fight of endings
-

**Chapter 0: Prologue**

The whole time everyone thought they were save on their planet. No one knew what was about to happen. Millions of years, the human race just kept on developing, not caring about what bad might could happen in the far future.

Some call this event “the happening”. Others just call it “the end”.
Let me tell you all about the war between heaven, hell and earth.

**Chapter 1: The human race**

The human race is a very interesting race. It’s a quickly developing, advanced species, which invented new technologies and stole others from different planets. But also the humans are stupid. They waste a lot of energy and resources fighting each other over different beliefs or views. They would be a superior race, if they would only join each other, rather than just fighting each other.

**Chapter 2: In the beginning god created…**

There was always a thought of an afterlife. A few thousand years ago, scientists discovered two planets. One with all the good and one with all the bad memories of the deceased. Matching to their ideas of the life after death, they called the two planets “Heaven” and “Hell”.

Life on earth changed after this discovery. People were scared but also happy. They started to take advantage of these planets. Space engineering was advanced, so the earthlings managed to dock these two on earth. Heaven at the North Pole and Hell at the South Pole.

 People weren’t worrying about dying anymore. They knew they could just come back and knew where they were. Due to the connection of the three planets, there was a way to get from Heaven to Hell and vice versa. The docking-connections were called “Highway to Hell” and “Stairway to Heaven”. If someone ended up in Hell, they would just move themselves to Heaven.

Both the ruler of Heaven, Morgan Freeman, and the rulers of Hell, Angus and Malcolm Young, didn’t like the idea of a connection between the two. They were enemies since the creation of the planets. The whole conception of peace was not an option for the two.

**Chapter 3: The evil plan**

As this relationship was developing, Heaven and Hell were fighting each other, but Earth managed to keep them down with their advanced weaponry.

Angus Young had enough of the constant in-between between war and peace. He had a plan to extinguish Earth and shut down the connection. He explained his devilish plan to Malcolm, who tried to contain his evil laughter. The plan was as follows:

All they need to do is to get their hands on the top military general, who knew all about the special weapons and techniques the earthlings were using.
He could lead them into war and shut down Earth, before Heaven could come to help. They could blow up Earth and be done with it. There would only be Heaven and Hell again.

The hardest part about this whole mission was, to get the top military general, because in the world at this time, there were very strict restrictions, so a man in this position was granted to go to heaven. The two brothers of Hell chewed their brains out how they could affect the war chief.

The solution was simple. Humans don’t have a lot of weaknesses, but one of the strongest ones was love. All they had to do was to get him to fall in love with a woman, destined to go to Hell.

So they created a simulation of a woman. It was the most beautiful woman there could’ve ever been on earth, with the charm that could lull any man there was. She had lips as red as blood and hair as black as the night. Her body was formed to perfection with enough characteristics to look real. Her character was smart and just as the general liked it.

They sent her to his favorite bar and let things happen.

**Chapter 4: The good plan**

Around the same time, but not the same place, Morgan Freeman was thinking of a way to lose the connection to Hell as well. But Morgan didn’t want to cause any harm whilst doing it, so he came up with a plan that would get him and his planet away, but also no leave Earth to the Young brothers.

The idea was to gain trust of the civilians of earth and to convince them to undock both planets.

So he created someone as well. He created a man. The smartest mind there is in the sense of learning new things. He didn’t look out of the ordinary; he was just a basic IT-guy.

Morgan sent his minion to learn all about projection technology, because that way Morgan could project himself over the whole world, so everyone could see him.

**Chapter 5: When two worlds collide**

Their plans went pretty great, on both sides. The Young brothers managed to get the general to fall in love with their girl and Morgan’s minion has already learned a lot about projection and was working on a new technology, which would allow Morgan to close his plan.

The beautiful woman killed her lover and the general went to hell, because he was messing with the devil’s work. So he was forced to explain all the weaknesses of the system and then got promoted to the Young’s assistant. 

They were ready to attack.

In the meanwhile, Morgan’s IT-guy had finished his project as well. Morgan immediately started streaming his message to the people. They shook their head in disbelief. The connection between the three planets was one of the best things that happened, ever since earth exists! Why would they just cut the connections?

The Young brothers listened to Morgan whole speech and were shocked, maybe a little bit scared. As they saw that people were considering giving up on the planets, their patience ran thin. They ordered to attack.

Hell’s army came in and knew their way around most of the weaponry, because of the general’s information.

Heaven’s army buckled up and got themselves ready.

Morgan had to think fast, what the most efficient way to this situation was. He decided to send his storm Troup to disconnect Hell from Earth, while trying to save as many lives as possible.

Earth had a hard time fighting back Hell’s army, but gave it real competition.
Heaven’s attempt at disconnecting Hell succeeded, but Hell wasn’t finished yet. They started to drill in direction of Earth’s core to place explosives there.

Heaven’s army was exhausted and got sent to hell, since they had to cause harm and died afterwards. Since Hell was disconnected now, they couldn’t return to battle.

Hell’s army was making progress in drilling to the core. What they didn’t calculate in was a lone hero, coming to save his own planet.

His name was simple. IT-guy. He created a lasergun, which would shoot an incredibly hot laser and burn everything it touches.

He spotted the big load of explosives and had the idea to shoot it. Well said, well done. The big pile of explosives exploded and killed everything on the whole earth.

Hell’s army was defeated. Humanity was defeated.  IT-guy survived, because he was a simulation and it was impossible for him to die, if Morgan didn’t want him to.

IT-guy disconnected Heaven from Earth and was left behind with many thanks by Morgan.

So IT-guy began to search earth for live. He found one person still alive.
She had lips as red as blood and hair as black as the night. Her body was formed to perfection with enough characteristics to look real.

He called her Eve and she called him Adam. And they began to reproduce humanity.

And if they didn’t die yet, it’s about damn time.

I was wondering about the personal one. Why?

I myself am considered effeminate, maybe because I grew up in a houshold with my mom and my sister. People also ask(ed) if I were gay (I'm not).

You made me wonder about your statement:

&gt;Maybe just 'cause I was weird, I could never figure it out.

And as weird as I might sound, the impression you get when you meet me is, that I'm weird. I kind of like it, because it's a neutral weird, it can just go up from there.

Probably you have few to none ""enemies"", cause I can't think of one I personally know for myself.

My goal in life is to help people and I thought about studying psychology to do so.

TL:DR; I was curious because I kind of saw ""myself""
