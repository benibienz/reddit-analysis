The game was made in a comic style (drawn) and of course completely 2D. It was a CD game and I'm not sure if there where animated gloves performing magic in the intro (as company-logo)..

Now they weren't ordinary puzzles; you were given some items and a problem case and had to interact to solve the problem.

An few examples, which I'm sure off, were in the game:

----
You just had a flat tire in the middle of nowhere and your screws for the tire flew off too. 

What you had to do, you changed the tire and took one screw off every other wheel, so you had 3 screws on each wheel.

----
You're a police man and have to watch over a cell with the best escapist ever. You could do preparations and when you were done he would break out. Mostly by spitting his chewing gum at the lamp and breaking it, then escaping.

The solution was to screw out the light bulb and use a smaller light to shine towards the lamp, so the lamp was bright. So when he tried to spit it out, it would just hit the lamp and he couldn't escape.

----

There was also a level where you were in america and had a friend in asia. You wanted to send him some candy, but in the middle there was a postman who would try to open it the entire time and eat the candy. You could only edit the package (with locks or tape or something like that) on either side (asia or america).

No idea how that was solved, probably with a public/private key system.

If you don't know what boating is, it's when the joint is uneven lit and starts building exess paper, the boat.

**How to avoid boating in the first place**

To avoid boating, you simply have to light the joint evenly, so the amber isn't only on one side of the joint.

Also you could try to roll the joint backwards (See the [tutorial](https://redd.it/4j8bqo)) instead of forwards. If you turn forwards, there is a good chance that there's more paper on one side (2-layered) than on the other (1-layered).

**How to save your joint from boating**

What most people do, is just burn the paper off, but most of the times it doesn't just glim away, it lights a flame, which is pretty shocking.

What I like to do is lick my thumb and put the saliva under the lower spot. The saliva prevents the paper from burning and allows the boat to catch up. Afterwards you'll have a once again evenly lighted joint.

I'm a Computer science apprentice and my friends and I Play lots of games, ergo we all built our PCs ourselves.

Let's call the user $fr and me $me

Foreground:

The 7 year old computer of $fr wouldn't work anymore. USB-Ports weren't working, the shutdown-button wasn't reacting and his monitor wouldn't get any signal. Sounds like a classic mainboard failure, so pretty much the whole group already planned his new computer.

I wouldn't give up on the trusty old machine though and decided to take a look at it. After looking at it, I got a vacuum and cleaned out the case, GPU port, CPU-fan.. pretty much everything.

Somehow the USB-Ports worked again, he got signal on the monitor and everything worked as intended. The Powerbutton just fell back into the case, but was still fully functional.

I've never seen this version anywhere before, so I thought I'd share :)

[**The filter**](https://imgur.com/a/Xuinu): It has a great airflow and still filters out the rough parts.

[**The tobacco floor**](https://imgur.com/a/O3ssj): We basically only roll spliffs, so we have that available all the time. It's way more comfortable if you don't have the flame too close to your face.

[**The backwards roll**](https://imgur.com/a/Wn8Rk): Using the least paper I can use to roll, with only one layer of paper around the goods. You do that by taking the paper backwards (glue strip against you) and licking it through the rolled paper.

[**The knocking and the tearing**](https://imgur.com/a/0mPAY): Spreads the goods evenly, helps with the next step. Tearing the paper away is a step you better take slow, since it could destroy your whole joint.

[**The stuffing**](https://imgur.com/a/U6V3R): It makes the joint more dense so it burns a bit better.

[**The twist**](https://imgur.com/a/cDhaV): Also presses the goods a bit together and helps with the next part

[**The pinch**](https://imgur.com/a/xcVdr): This part helps enormously with flaming the joint, since you can burn the cap off easily and then pull it off. After that you can start flaming the joint and it will start to burn evenly.

[**The flame**](https://imgur.com/a/9gw5n): Burn around the tip of the joint, so the flame barely touches the paper of the pinch.

To start off, I've been smoking for a bit more than a year now, half of it daily.

When I started off, my rolling sucked. I started with a few friends and they were better then me. Way better. My joints would just turn out to be uneven, way too fat and sometimes the filter was way to wide and the joint would die very easily (rarely even pieces came through). They would rarely burn even.

Of course I let my friends roll when we were in a group. But I'd watch them, even ask them to explain it to me what they're doing.

I started to practise and soon enough I was able to roll a basic joint. Filter was OK and it was pretty smokeable.

My friends evolved though, started rolling backwards to use less paper and started complain about my joints again. So I let them built again.

They motivated me to roll backwards, which I just couldn't do. I don't know why, it just wasn't happening. Even after 10 or 11 tries, they would still fall apart.

But that didn't bring me down, I continued to train it until I found the point where I'd fail (how to hold my fingers, what movements, etc.) and I'd change it.

I improved a lot because I found fun in rolling.

Now my joints are rolled pretty good and I didn't even notice. Somehow I'm pretty proud about that.

I commonly roll the j's in my group, just because mine are the best atm. Maybe my throne will be taken though haha

So in the end, practise makes perfect (which I'm not yet obv.) and to help you, here's my list on what I'm doing and why:

In the end of the evening I snorted around 240 to 260 mg and my friend around 320.

My first line was 200mg and I didn't feel anything for like an hour, even though I snorted it. Our ""dealer"" offered me another line for free, because it didn't work, so I took it.

We were rolling. It was so much fun, I felt amazing. Also we smoked so much weed... I feel like after some time we weren't rolling anymore, we were just incredibly high.

I never really thought about this.

I don't have any problems to get to know people I don't know. I once went to a party, where I knew one person out of 20 people and I had a great time. I'm still in contact with some of those.

But then again, there's something that holds me back. I feel like I'm scared of interrupting people while they're doing their job.

For example: I'm scared to just go into a pharmacy to buy some eyedrops. I need a moment and a lot of willpower to do it.

Also that's why I don't ask so much questions, because I think I can do it alone.

It is about smokebombs...

---

Some mildly important backstory:

I live in a two-story-house and my mom works at home, in the lower floor. My room is in the upper floor.

---
**This story** is about 8 years ago, when I was 10. It was around the 1st of august (national holiday and birthday of Switzerland). I had just bought 2 sixpacks of smokebombs and a lot of other small firework stuff, like lady-crackers and such.

On the 31st of july, some friends and I found joy in lighting such smokebombs and throwing them into the local creek that goes through our town. They would land on the water and float, sometimes even spin and let all the smoke out. Beautiful to watch.

We blew almost both packs, so I only had 2 bombs left. A red and a yellow one.

At home on the 1st of august I had to entertain myself until the evening, where I could blast the ""big"" fireworks my mom bought. The window in my room is coincidentally facing the creek. My stupid 10 year old brain decides to throw the smokebombs from my room, over the compost, into the creek.

First the red one, then the yellow one. Only problem is, I didn't hit the creek with the yellow one, it just landed on the compost instead.

My mother was currently working as she looked outside the window, just to discover a smoking compost. She of course thought it was burning and rushed outside and grabbed the water hose on her way.

Obviously she discovers the source and curses me out for it. Wasn't allowed to light the fireworks in the evening, which was kinda sad.

**Tl;dr:** Tried smoking the creek, smoked the compost instead. Wasn't allowed to light the big one in the evening.

We were sitting there and I was performing magic tricks. Not card tricks, just physically impossible shit, like I made stuff disappear and appear that wasn't even near me, in an eyeblink. The stuff worked because like 2 or 3 people were helping me and I was just doing the show. Once I interferred by slaming my hand on the table while it was dark. I spilled coffee over the girl opposite of me, *whoops*.

So the nice guy I am, I go get a cup of water for her to clean herself up. Somehow I first took tea and handed it to her. She noted it was tea and that's not gonna help at all, so I handed her a cup of mineral water. There wasn't any water without gas.

So now I notice that there's a leak in the ceiling and it's leaking water. Like as if there was a water-filled bathroom up there. I tell the people in the room and a guy in the doorframe (who wasn't there before) answers, it's what he is here for. So I ignore it and sit down on my previous spot, it's kind of a couch now.

So this girl sits down on my left and I flirt the shit out of her. Like I get her to hold hands with me. Like flirtingly playing. The girl to my right has been watching all along and somehow decides to lean in and kiss me. Like tongue-kissing. She was terribly bad at it. 

*Note, this is all happening while I'm still holding hands with the other girl.*

As the righthand side girl stops kissing me, the coffee-girl just makes a silly joke and starts kissing me as well. I was like WTF, but oh well, what can I do.

At this point the people in the room have easily tripled their number, so the room was now a straight up party. I glimpse outside the window and see my friend walking by, drunk as fuck. So I naturally wave him like crazy and open the window to scream some bullshit at him, while having a lot of joy. He and his friends start laughing (like drunk laughing) and he waves back and screams he's having a great time.

So I go back in and the room is pretty full by now. I sit down on a different couch and some random mother (of another girl that was there) came up to me and showed me the son of her daughter, while said girl just awkwardly stood there. I was like WTF again, but figured the mother was telling me to wear a condom. I didn't even notice her daughter before. I just ignored her and the girl took her son (who was as old as he could've been her younger brother) away.

The coffee girl was just following me around through all this and also just stood there awkwardly. So I look at her with a ""WTF was that""-look and she just smiles and shrugs back.

Suddenly a guy comes up behind her and drags her by the hair to another room close by. Apparently no one seemed to notice. I fought my way into the other room and saw some chubby asian guys on a couch watching television while the guy rapes the coffee girl behind them. I was outraged and stormed at him, screaming to let her go.

I put the filter in place and spread the weed neatly on the paper. It was at that moment when our roomba (vaccuming robot) hit my leg.

I was so shocked, I spilled most of the weed and guess where it fell. The roomba didn't care twice about my precious green and just vacuumed most of it in.

We were to slow to rescue it, due to being too high and just scraped it out of it. It was pretty dusty, but we managed to seperate it fairly well and it took us *only* 30 minutes.
