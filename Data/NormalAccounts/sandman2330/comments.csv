988,"Need help identifying this poker set and advice on how to sell it.

Bought a poker set for $5. Got home and notices a whole row of chips are missing and a couple of chips are mixed together with others. There is also no green row. I don't know anything on poker sets and would like some help.

[Pics]-Whole set

http://i.imgur.com/JWY9hlq.jpg

it didnt come that way, i re organized the chips. It was originally 5 rows on the left and 4 on the right.I didnt notice this till after i got home

[The chips]

http://i.imgur.com/BqgA8Nw.jpg

These are the chips individually. I couldn't find some that look like these. Notice how the are some red chips that seem to be faded from the others. After i reorganized them, it made a complete row of faded red chip. Which tells me the guy probably threw these in from another set (possibly). 

[2 decks of card]

http://i.imgur.com/g9DS0VO.jpg

Here's the 2 decks of cards that might lead to some clues. i google'd both of these and neither of them make poker sets. 

So what im thinking is buying separate rows at the sports store and selling the case as is, but i don't know who makes this set. no names on anything other than the decks of cards.
