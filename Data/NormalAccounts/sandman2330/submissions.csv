Anyways,the movie is about this family and the live in this house that is kinda away from the other houses. And the dad (steve martin) was sad because they never got any mail. Im guessing he never did anything important enough to get any letters delivered to him. I also remember him have a teenaged daughter(i think blonde) who would just get so excited she would just dance randomly. at the end of the movie he sees the mail man come up to his mail boss and put mail in.
