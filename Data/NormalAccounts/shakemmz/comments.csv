Let me put it simpler for you, I find it fun to talk with people about summoners war and about other things. There are a lot of content catered towards the lgbt community, and me and the other 30 people in the chat have found it fun so far to talk about summoners war, as well as lgbt related topics. It's not even comparable to the racial segregation you are trying to put it against, and it's quite ridiculous that you compare them.

Like I said in another post, for example can you tell me how many people you know who are into something like rupauls drag race, and play summoners war? And then tell me how many of them are straight? There's all sort of content catered towards the lgbt community and I don't see why you find it so cringe worthy that people like to make communities in different games and forums, etc related to the LGBT community. It's a great way to socialize with people who have gone through similar situations, might like similar things and just happen to also enjoy playing this game. 

Like I said, there's already 30 people in the chat, several of which are straight and have no problem with the idea of the chat itself, and are enjoying every bit as much as everyone else. I think the main post failed in not making clear that straight people are also welcome in the chat as long as there's no discrimination and over everything love this game. 

And socializing can help enhance anyone's gaming experience. In my opinion most games like this would be boring as fuck if it wasn't for their communities. If it's not for you then move along and don't join. Nobody is forcing you to, but there's people interested in the chat (we have recruited a few people from this topic), and at the end of the day we are having fun there without hurting anyone.

70,"There's different types of communities with different interests everywhere. The chat has been a fun way to get to socialize with new people who are interested in similar stuff and also happen to enjoy the game. Like rashagal said, it's the same reason straight guys have their ""bros"" and girls have their girlfriends. 

Let's be real, as an example how many straight guys want to talk about say Rupauls Drag race who are also interested in summoners war? There's things that are made directed towards an LGBT audience, and while not every single gay person will be interested in these (and I also know some straight guys who happen love some of this things), it's easier to find a gay guy who likes a show like Rupaul's Drag Race than a straight guy. 

And this is just an EXAMPLE, we are not talking about LGBT stuff all day every day. However it's fun being able to talk about such topics with people that also happen to enjoy playing Summoners War.

Mine has 239 speed (counting tyron lead) and he can outspeed most things up here, but sometimes still gets outsped by some chloes in conq. However it's very good against veromos teams since they have no way to prevent the sleep, and it's pretty straight forward. If your aschubel is fully skilled, the team should be able to keep them cc'd all the time (2 turns sleep, + 1 turn tyron, + aschubel normally steals 2 turns with mobilize, turbulence and that speed so his sleep should be back up by the time they unfreeze.) It probably won't work as I move up cause people will start using will runes on their immunity.

133,"&gt; u build your farmer, your next focus should be building a gb10 team.

Fatal blade or rage blade to start with should work on him, though eventually you will want him violent. Really depends on the runes you have available right now. You can either go atk/atk/atk or atk/crit d/atk if you can get his crit rate high enough. If you can't do a hell stage yet, then you can try faimon hard or even faimon normal. They aren't as efficient but they work early on. Also if you have a ramagos built up, you might want to try him out in hydeni hell 5. He was my early farmer until I could get something faster.

If you want to build a faimon farmer first thoughm then susano would be the way to go. Sigmarus can do it but the runes requirement are pretty high since he is really squishy. You could also try the wind succubus on hydeni hell 5, if she works there you might just be able to farm hydeni hell while you get a better farmer. 

You should not be worrying about arena at the moment, try to use your wings as much as you can to get glory points and upgrade your buildings starting with the energy ones, and then moving to the stats (they will help you a lot later on).

168,"First thing you need in SW is someone who can efficiently farm hell stages so you can level up your other monsters faster. At first, I used ramagos (wind warbear) to do hydeni 5 hell, and he's pretty efficient at 5* with 4* runes full hp energy. Only issue with him is that his clear is slow. However, as you progress further you can build up something that can solo faimon hell 1 (from what you have, lapis, water epikion and water mammoth can do it). Ramagos for hydeni is just your safest bet for now, in my opinion. I'm pretty sure julien (phantom thief) can solo it too, but not sure what the rune requirements for that would be. After Ramagos, Julien can definitely be your main damage source through your early and mid game, so I would work on him. I have seen a lot of people who 6* him. 


As far as some easily obtainable monsters that can help you, there are a lot from secret dungeons, specially a lot of light monsters like the inugami, vagabond, bearman and fairy. Then there's the fire inugami, and the wind griffon (obtainable through stages). The werewolves are overall pretty interesting, and that water mammoth could really be useful too.

After you get a decent farmer and start leveling up monsters, the next step is starting to build up a good giants team. But once you get there, you can ask for more advice into that. 


Very important though! Check  the fusion hexagram, and lock the materials you have. There's a few monsters you can only obtain through scrolls, and can be a struggle to obtain later on when you're ready to fuse up veromos or any other nat 5.

173,"I am also short-tempered, and no other game has ever gotten me as angry as this game (I broke a laptop during one game xD), and if I am honest, I have before raged at people. However except for one time, every single other time when I have raged at anybody, it is because they are ruining the experience of the game for me and for the team, and I just end up putting them on ignore and asking for the rest of the people in the team to do so too. Because what you don't see is that when you decide to insult someone in the game, the whole atmosphere of the team is ruined. 

The one time I did rage unjustifiably, was because I was having a bad game, and going through a rough time outside too, and I instantly realized so, and asked my team to please put me on ignore because I was angry and I didn't want to rage at anybody. People understood, and maybe they blocked me, maybe they didn't, but I didn't rage anymore that game after that. The ignore button is there for a reason. If someone is pissing you off, block them, don't insult them.  

A game is not something worth calling another human being any insults for. Everyone has bad games, and some people are better than others, but if you are getting matched with those people, and you play enough, it's because you are on the same level as them and do as many mistakes at them. Would you like it if someone calls you a retard every time you make a mistake? Under your own argument, if someone does wrong, you don't spit at them, you try to help them improve. And you can help them improve without being an asshole. 

In my opinion, Riot is doing a lot just by letting you play the game while being chat restricted instead of banning you for the toxic behavior. What I'm saying is it requires continuous toxic behavior to be punished by riot. And to be honest, I believe that  allowing you to still play their game, and giving you the chance to prove you have improved should be reward enough for toxic players. But they not only do that, they also let you have a chance to get the rewards during the next season. So if you are truthfully reformed, prove it during the next season and earn those rewards.",2015-08-21 14:57:07+00:00,cuape0o,8.0,t1_cuao053,2271,leagueoflegends

People shouldn't feel forced to not be toxic just to get rewards, we are not 3 years old when our mothers had to reward us for peeing correctly in the toilet.
