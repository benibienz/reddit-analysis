We have gotten a few newer people, and aiming this week to properly establish and get a few new members. Accepting players of any level, the main requirements are having a nice attitude and downloading LINE Chat. We have a group chat there where we socialize and it's easier to help newer people through there. Contact Shakemmz on line for more information. The name of the guild is GFury. Feel free to contact me regardless of if you've played the game for a day or a year, we mainly just want to have fun in a nice little group of people who enjoy this game.
