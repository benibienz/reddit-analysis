1,"Yeah SLI is one of the other topics many people haven't showed their results yet. Guess you really have to try it out, it would be cool if you could tell us if it works or not, because there are probably other people who'd also like to know if it works.

Glad I could help you, I wish you good luck with getting everything up and running, it'll definitely be an awesome build if you get everything to work smoothly, have fun!",2016-11-21 14:03:47+00:00,da9ho60,,t1_da9gwkk,1520.0,hackintosh
2,"&gt; Sorry about my lack of clarity on this one. I was more curious about the shutdown/powercycle sequence of the guest without powercycling the host? For example if you have two Windows guests, winGuestA and winGuestB, while keeping the host machine powered on, can you either restart winGuestA without restarting the host or shutdown winGuestA and passthrough to winGuestB without powercycling? I've read people having to do a bit of odd behavior regarding this, but it seemed to be more specific motherboards which were consumer oriented.

Okay, I also didn't get what you meant so I assumed you meant powercycling the host. But I haven't had any problems with restarting the guest multiple times, I also accidentally shut down the Windows guest out of habit so the host was still running for 16 hours, then I started the guest again and I had no sideeffects, so it seems pretty stable.

&gt; My personal fear with this is that it would install other devices which may try to compete with your passthrough devices. 

I didn't have any problems with all the drivers, but you can extract the drivers manually of course, the paravirtualized controller drivers don't even need to be extracted, while installing Windows it's necessary to mount the vmware tools isos to install the pv drivers anyway, else it won't find any disks, everthing else is optional, except the ethernet adapters if you use the paravirtualized adapters.

&gt; Usually passthrough of an onboard isn't recommended from what I've seen but seems like it worked for you.

Yeah it worked and except for the soundcard hiccups everything else worked fine, but I'd also recommend using a PCIe usb controller.

&gt; Yeah the build I've been speccing out has a Supermicro X10DRG-Q as the motherboard with a SC747 chassis. One of the only boards in the world that support 4-way SLI (I don't plan to use that feature hah), it's a dual processor LGA2011-3 board, plus it's a Supermicro board so it's enterprise as hell.

I'd also go for Supermicro, I have one in my homeserver and I'm pretty satisfied with it, I can pass through the onboard SAS controller to my FreeNAS VM which was 100% stable now for over a year with KVM and ESXi aswell.
Going with Haswell-E or Broadwell-E is also a good idea since normal Haswell Xeons have limitations when it comes to device isolation, even though it works fine with my E3 Xeons now, back when I started with the whole passthrough project at home I had IOMMU grouping problems with KVM and GPU passthrough under ESXi wasn't even possible with my hardware because of said limitations.

&gt; Seriously thanks though. Been hard to come by a lot of information on people doing this and really surprised I haven't seen more of it. Glad to know it's working.

You're welcome. :) I'm also kind of tempted to switch to an LGA-2011-3 board since I'd like to have more expansion capability but I'm a little hesitant because I'm actually still new to OSX/macOS and I'm still at evaluating if I really need it for my daily tasks since everything I do can also be done on Windows, I really wanna use it just because of the sleek UI haha.",2016-11-21 13:24:34+00:00,da9ginv,,t1_da9elqn,5000.0,hackintosh
3,"Yeah it's fine, nothing wrong with asking questions about this, since this topic hasn't been really talked about a lot.

Powercycling the whole machine is no problem, I've set both vms to autostart and I shut down the whole pc with just pressing the powerbutton on the pc once, since I don't wanna log into the vSphere client for that everytime.

VMware Tools are installed for using the paravirtualized disk controller.

I played DarkSiders 2 once and it ran without problems, but I haven't played for a long time so I can't really confirm that it's stable. I've also been running Unigine Heaven for half an hour which was stable. I don't have a Vive.

I'm using a Samsung EVO 850 as datastore with a 100GB vmdk for each vm.

For the few things I did on macOS the GTX 770 ran fine, I haven't noticed any problems. The only thing that has been bothering me a lot is my USB soundcard, I passed through my onboard USB controller to the Windows VM and I have this problem that the soundcard stops working for half a second every 2-5 minutes which is really damn annoying while talking to people over voicechat or watching videos.

I think this would be solved if I used a PCIe soundcard, but I actually don't want to buy one, maybe a PCIe usb controller could also fix this issue, but there is a high chance that I'd experience the same problem with the usb controller so meh.

IMHO I'd rather get a server grade board for this setup with ECC ram to provide more stability than with consumer boards because I think, I'm not sure, that the cause for hiccups is often related to consumer grade hardware. I also had good results with KVM, there are some good guides for unRAID and if you know what you have to do you can also achieve that with Proxmox which was my favorite until I switched to ESXi.",2016-11-21 09:12:11+00:00,da9brzp,,t1_da8xy2u,26492.0,hackintosh
4,"I executed the cat commands and /var/lib/vz/images/203/vm-203-disk-1.qcow2 was indeed the right path.

I also now remember that I used mv to flatten the folder hierarchy inside the images directory, don't ask why I did something so unnecessary but I did and if that has overwritten the file because there was another disk with the same name somewhere in these folders, the disk is pretty much gone I guess. 

That would explain why there are no deleted inodes when using lsdel and testdisk only found the folder 203 but there was nothing in it. So I guess this problem is unresolvable, lessions learned. It's a shame about the data on that VM though, but it wasn't really important enough to make backups beforehand so whatever, but thanks for your help!

*Edit:* Yup it's what I expected, there probably was a vm-203-disk-1.raw in the same directory which was indeed my old vm with OpenMediaVault, I guess I've used some really stupid mv command and it has overwritten my qcow2 with that raw disk, because Proxmox can't even start the VM with that disk, it says the disk is not in a qcow2 format. 

That would be a logical explanation why this happened, what I can't figure out is how I even came up with the idea that I want to flatten the directory structure and what parameters I've used with mv to cause such a scenario, BUT I probably was high AF when I did this, which explains the loss of memory and the stupid decision. I've learned two things today, first, don't use mv for this and second, don't smoke weed while doing important stuff.",2016-11-14 17:37:00+00:00,da01a3a,8.0,t1_d9zyszz,3093.0,homelab

I also ran find and that disk was the only one that was found, I also checked all my other vm disks even though I knew they weren't the right ones, no luck either.

When I get home today I will try and look if the file may have been overridden by the older disk somehow. I'm glad I didn't gave up yet and formatted the Proxmox drive.",2016-11-14 08:25:41+00:00,d9zlfra,2.0,t1_d9za9ep,21247.0,homelab

16,"Soo I've gotten passthrough to work with my Nvidia Geforce GTX 770. Only thing I had to do was add ""hypervisor.cpuid.v0 = FALSE"" to my .vmx file so the Nvidia drivers won't detect that it's a virtual machine.

3DMark 11 and Unigine Heaven seem to be working fine, to my surprise, the virtual machine had a better 3DMark 11 score than my current windows installation on the same physical host which is kinda strange.

* Physical Machine Benchmark: http://www.3dmark.com/3dm11/11719322 
* Older Physical Benchmark when the system was freshly installed: http://www.3dmark.com/3dm11/8479686
* Virtual Machine Benchmark: http://www.3dmark.com/3dm11/11719284

So compared to the current state of my system, the virtual machine seems to be even faster, but since I haven't installed Windows freshly it's probably not that trustworthy, but I luckily found an older benchmark which's score was just 200 above the virtualized machines. Of course I can't determine the performance of the system just from 3 benchmarks, but they can give me a rough overview of how fast it probably is. Which is around 3-8% slower than native which is fine I IMHO.

After I've backed up the files on my main SSD I'll use it as datastore and move the VM to it and will pass through a USB controller for my keyboard etc. after that I think I'll use it for a few weeks and see how it goes. If it's stable enough I might stay with this setup. :)

You mentioned mednafen-psx as core for PSX, how does it compare to ePSXe? Compatibility and performance wise I mean. I don't really need any graphic enhancements, I wanna have an as native as possible experience with CRT shaders, so the mednafen-psx core is the way to go, right?

57,"**TL;DR: Cheapest Nvidia Shield TV (though there can be problems with some games). Second cheapest is a used PC. Third a selfbuilt PC and the most expensive would be a prebuilt PC from MSI or ASUS, maybe Gigabyte if they even got prebuilds.**

The cheapest way or at least the best price per performance is always building a PC yourself, it's pretty easy but takes a few hours the first time, if you wanna do that then I'd recommend getting help from /r/pcmasterrace. For Dolphin I'd recommend at least an Intel i5 as CPU and a GTX 960 (maybe even a GTX950 if you're good enough playing without any additional tweaks) and you have a lot of performance for Dolphin and you can crank up the settings to a good amount so that all games look way better than on the Wii or GC.

BUT many people don't like building it themselves, maybe because of the effort it takes, sometimes because they don't think they can do it and I get that some people just wanna plug in and play which is fine. So you have three other options which are probably almost as cheap as building a PC yourself:

1. The cheapest option in my opinion is currently getting an Nvidia Shield TV for 200 bucks which is said to run awesome with Dolphin. But I can't actually recommend it since I have no experience with running Dolphin on my Shield TV, but many people say most of the games run almost flawlessly, but again **almost**.

2. Look for a used PC, often you can get PCs with third or fourth gen (Ivybridge/Haswell) Intel i5s and some decent CPUs from the last gen like the GTX 770 which I have and it runs all games perfectly fine with high settings. If you're lucky you can find a PC with awesome specs for under 400-500 bucks. But it takes some time to find a good one. Look for Intel i5/i7 3xxx or 4xxx CPUs and Nvidia GTX x70/x80 series, though I wouldn't buy anything below the GTX 670 since they are getting really old and don't come near the performance of todays GPUs.

3. If you don't wanna wait to find a good used PC or try out the Shield TV I'd recommend getting a prebuilt PC for around 600-800 bucks from ASUS or MSI, I can't give you specific model numbers since I'm not actually that fond of prebuilt PCs but again, /r/pcmasterrace can help you, even though it happens that some ignorant doesn't give a damn about what you want and just says things like ""build it yourself"", which you have to ignore, there are always people like that.

FYI: Prices can vary, I've based my prices on Euro, if you're from GB or the US they may vary.",2016-08-15 11:59:01+00:00,d6i6vsg,4.0,t1_d6i68t3,1795.0,emulation

59,"**TL;DR: Is the list below a good choice of emulators or should I rather use RetroArch for the older systems?** 

So I'm setting up my gaming pc to be able to launch multiple emulators with Steam BigPicture as frontend (via [Ice](https://scottrice.github.io/Ice/)).

Now I'm searching for the best emulators to use and have some questions. Here is a list of the ones I picked:

* GB/GBC: BGB
* GBA: VBA-M
* NDS: DeSmuME
* PSP: PPSSPP
* NES: NEStopia
* SNES: snes9x
* N64: Mupen64plus
* PSX: ePSXe
* PS2: PCSX2
* GC/Wii: Dolphin

So my question is, would you recommend me other emulators or did I pick the right ones. Or would you rather recommend me to use RetroArch instead of the standalone versions of these emulators? At least for the ones that have RetroArch plugins.

What's important for me is, that the emulators have a way to be launched from the commandline and that they can be automatically launched in fullscreen and I really want to have support for shaders so I can use some CRT shaders to at least make it look like I'm using a CRT since I have absolutely no space in my living room for a CRT tv or monitor.

**Edit:** Alright, I've pretty much found the answer, since RetroArch supports shaders for all its cores I'll use it instead of all the standalone emus.

Well you can also use a mouse with 2000 DPI, but then you'd have to drag your mouse over the whole desk to make a 90 degree turn. To get it faster you'd need to crank up the speed in your XIM config and the higher you set the value the more likely it is to become choppy, that's the reason why people flame about the XIM being ""not like PC gaming because it's all laggy and choppy blahblah"".

With 9k or more DPI you don't need to set the speed on your XIM to such high values, resulting in smooth and fast movement. I don't know anything about sensors, so I can't argue with that, but 2k vs 9k with a XIM definitely makes a noticable difference.

&gt; The XIM is terrible anyway, it's a crappy attempt at emulating 1;! crosshair movement.

Any source on that? Because from what I've read it's the only adapter that even gets close to 1:1 mouse movement, which is the reason why I bought it.",2016-04-08 22:04:39+00:00,d1vhzed,5.0,t1_d1veqgo,4828.0,pcmasterrace

No I don't confuse anything, mate. A ""website server"" is a machine that has a webserver installed and in most cases the user doesn't have access to install anything else on it. And a host is most likely a machine that hosts stuff, like software that can serve websites, for short a webserver. A VPS for example is a host, but you can also call it a server, like the name says, virtual private server.

My system load is fairly low, it has a quad core Xeon with Hyperthreading, so it should have enough beef to handle everything. But latency could actually be a problem. I might pass through the whole USB controller to see if there is an improvement.

The thing is, if I could get it to run in a container, there wouldn't be any problem with latency since the container just gets access to the device without any complicated process.

So I worked part-time over the holidays and built my own NAS with an ASRock E350M1. I also ran Windows Server for a while, but then I switched back to good ol' Debian when I started setting up game servers. I also played with Arch and CentOS, but for my servers I always end up with Debian and Ubuntu, it's just what I feel the most comfortable with, though I really love Arch and I'm still searching for a usecase where it makes sense for me to use it again.

In the past 6 years I've gained a pretty good amount of experience with Linux and upgraded my NAS little by little with consumer hardware when the number of vms was rising. I always had lots of hardware lying around and I sometimes built myself small rigs for testing whatever, but when I realized I had no use for them I disassembled and sold the parts.

Now since I've finished school and have a full-time job as a Java developer I earned enough to build myself a pretty decent server (Supermicro X10SL7-F, Xeon E3-1230v3 and 32G of ECC RAM) which I am satisfied with.

It's running Proxmox under Debian 8 and last week I successfully virtualized my HTPC with VGA passthrough and a virtual OSX machine, which I have no use for though. I'm currently at migrating my virtual machines to containers and I've set up a virtual machine as access point for my wifi devices. Next thing is LDAP at home, getting familiar with Ansible and I also want to look at LACP, since I finally got my 24 port switch.

I also switched to Proxmox with LXContainers on my VPS and I'm thinking about switching my desktop to Proxmox and virtualize my gaming rig, since GPU passthrough works pretty good with my virtual OpenELEC and OSX machines.

I was planning to use GPU passthrough which worked to a certain extent but OpenELECs X server just wouldn't start with my AMD GPU and I have no clue why, that's the reason why I wanted to investigate the config unRAID uses for their OpenELEC template, because I may have missed some parameter or that unRAID uses a special build of OE which I wanted to install. I also tried Kodibuntu but I also had problems with the X server, so I'm guessing the GPU is at fault, but I wanted to test things out a little more, before I get myself an Nvidia GPU.

I use Emby on my virtual OMV machine as alternative to Plex, since there is an official Kodi addon that fully integrates the Emby database into Kodi on my HTPC which is way better than the PleXBMC Addon for Kodi. And since Plex has no official Live TV implementation, which I need since I also watch TV on my HTPC, it's no alternative for me, I also don't even want a replacement since Kodi+Emby is just wonderful, but streaming on the go wouldn't even be possible for me even with Plex since my upload at home is just too low with 1,2mbps. I also don't have enough mobile internet volume (300MB per month) and there is no wifi in the train so even IF I had a decent upload at home, I couldn't really use it and aside from riding the train once a month when I visit my parents, there would be no situation where I'd use streaming.",2016-03-10 14:43:19+00:00,d0uppkb,4.0,t1_d0uob87,2641.0,unRAID

I've looked at pictures and it looks wonderful, but I'll look at some vids too after I get home. TBH a Ducky Shine 4 would be enough for me since the only LED color I need is red.

But my german retailer will also have the DS5 until end of September so I'll wait and then decide if it's worth the extra bucks I probably have to pay for. :)",2015-08-04 14:44:48+00:00,ctr4ax3,2.0,t1_ctr0xqe,6697.0,MechanicalKeyboards

407,"Ohhh ahhh, thank you, since I downloaded the Aeon MQ5 Extrapack for some backgrounds it should theoretically work now when I select None. But I finally split my Anime from my TV Shows, so I'm happy af, it's awesome that the widgets even work with Smart Playlists, so I don't have to set a custom widget slot for my library. 

I created a custom node which filters my unwatched and inprogress Anime and sorts them by the date I added them, but I might convert it to a playlist, so I can keep my custom widget slots for something else.

I really like it too, works like a charm and is the only skin besides Eminence and the Aeon MQ Series which I found pleasurable. But Eminence doesn't support Skin Shortcuts and Aeon MQ takes forever to get a stable release, the current beta is just for Helix but Team Kodi already released Isengard.",2015-07-27 07:22:08+00:00,cthjey3,6.0,t1_ctgqpys,55756.0,xbmc
408,"So I installed it now, it works great with the widgets!
The only thing that bothers me, is that I have no widgets set for Settings, Power, Music or Videos but there is still the latest movie widget appearing above them, it seems like a bug..

For now I used a workaround and defined an empty custom widget for every menu entry which should not contain a widget. Seems like the no widget setting doesn't work with Isengard.

But it's great, I really like it, thank you!

Edit: As I just found out, I can use the same method for custom widgets on Aeon Nox. But I like Arctic Zephyr a little more than Aeon Nox. And Aeon Nox can't use fanart depending on widgets.",2015-07-26 14:40:10+00:00,ctgopwk,4.0,t1_ctfnqld,90478.0,xbmc

Thanks. the panel view bug doesn't seem to appear with KCC 4.5.1 so I only have to figure out what is causing the two volumes to appear as a single book and my problems are gone. :)",2015-06-23 10:53:53+00:00,csfrls1,7.0,t1_csfrfzt,662.0,manga
416,"I found the error which was causing this. I've read the Kindle Publishing Guidelines and found out, that the metadata field 
    &lt;meta name=""original-resolution"" content=""1200x1920""/&gt;
was missing, it's included for Kindle devices but not for custom and since Kindle Fire support was dropped, you probably won't implement this for custom devices..

I don't really want to change the reader software, since Perfect Viewer costs 3€ within the Amazon Store and like I said, I want to use the Kindle Reader because I can have all of my books within my library. So I probably have to fork KCC, learn Python and bring back Kindle Fire support or I'll have to implement my own application with Java. But I'll probably learn some Python, since forking your project is easier. :)

There is probably no chance of you picking Kindle Fire support back up right? Is there atleast by any chance a way where I can force disable panel view on MOBI files, which I don't need anyway? Your code already contains a noPV variable, so it probably only needs a way to force it via parameter or a checkbox in the gui.. I'm a Java dev, so I can't really do it on my own since I never used Python..",2015-06-23 08:48:12+00:00,csfpwjq,3.0,t1_csf3irq,46839.0,manga
418,"I tried to convert some manga for my Kindle Fire HDX 7 tablet, since I like the feature of converting it to MOBI so it will be displayed in my library.
So I set up the folder structure like in variant C in your Github Wiki, like this (I use Bleach as an example):

    Bleach
        ComicInfo.xml
        Volume 001
            Chapter 001
                001.jpg
                002.jpg
                003.jpg
            ...
            Chapter 007
                001.jpg
                002.jpg
                003.jpg
        Volume 002
            Chapter 008
                001.jpg
                002.jpg
                003.jpg
            ...
            Chapter 016
                001.jpg
                002.jpg
                003.jpg

(I only used Volume 1 and 2 for testing purposes).
Then I added the Bleach folder to my KCC queue, selected Other as device and format to MOBI and edited the other settings to my liking and then converted it.
It correctly read the file structure and it also read the info from the ComicInfo.xml and created me a Bleach 1.mobi and a Bleach 2.mobi with the correct authors and covers, as I can see within Calibre. 

**BUT** the title of the books is now Bleach [1/2] and Bleach [2/2], the problem with this is, that on my Kindle it sees them as ONE book, so it shows the cover of Bleach [1/2] in my library but its title is [Bleach 2/2] and if I open the book I can only see the contents of Bleach [2/2] and have no way of accessing Bleach [1/2].

This also is a bit inconvenient, every time I add a volume it has to redo all the existing volumes which takes up so much time and for example if I only put volume 2 into the Bleach folder, it still downloads the cover of volume 2, even if I added &lt;Volume&gt;2&lt;/Volume&gt; to the ComicInfo.xml...

So how can I achieve single volumes which also show up as single books within Kindle and Calibre?

Also is there any way I can disable the panel view for MOBI files? It just shows the upper left corner and if I try to swipe, it just switches to the next page instead of the next panel and I always have to doubletap to see the full page, but the cover for example doesn't have any panels (of course, because it's a cover). I use KCC 4.6 btw.",2015-06-22 19:38:43+00:00,csf36dd,1.0,t3_2rbus4,14598521.0,manga
