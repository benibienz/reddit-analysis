Yesterday I moved all the important data from the vm disks when I was at my last vm disk I mounted it and to my surprise, it wasn't the right one, the original vm was running xubuntu 16.04 and had an 8GB qcow2 disk. This disk that I backed up had provisioned 98GB and had Debian 8.5 installed, which could actually be a really old OMV installation of mine.

So I've put the old SSD with Proxmox back into my server and booted it to find out where my xUbuntu machine was gone. So I've checked the conf of the VM with id 203 and it said local:/vm-203-disk-1.qcow2, so I've navigated to /var/lib/vz/203 and mounted that disk and it's the same f**king disk with OMV not the one with xUbuntu, so what the hell could have happened to the xUbuntu disk??

I mean, how can a file completely transform into an older file?? I've also seen a 203.conf.save file when I looked for the 203.conf and I've found out that the 203.conf.save file was the old config of the OpenMediaVault machine which I deleted a long time ago, so wtf, is the ghost of my old OMV machine haunting me now?

And would there be any way of restoring the data with TestDrive or something?",homelab,Proxmox - VM disk contents changed after backup?,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/5cq08w/proxmox_vm_disk_contents_changed_after_backup/

I'm also running an El Captain VM with a HD5450 on the same machine, but I want to upgrade to Sierra and since the HD5450 doesn't work with Sierra I need a new graphics card.

At first I thought I'd get a GT 740 for the Sierra machine, but I also want to upgrade my gaming rig so I've thought I could also get a GTX 1070 for the Windows VM and use the GTX 770 for the Sierra VM.

The question is, does the GTX 770 work with Sierra? (I'm not using Clover, just the default VMware EFI firmware) I know I could try it out, but I'm not at home right now, so I could decide to buy the GTX 1070 if someone can confirm that it works.

And also can my Seasonic Platinum with 660W PSU supply enough power to both GPUs? It has an efficiency of 91% so it could supply around 600W.

The System:

* Gigabyte GA-Z87X-UD5H
* Intel Xeon E3-1245v3 (84W TDP)
* 2x8GB RAM (1.35V)
* 3x Samsung Spintpoint M9T (2.3W)
* Samsung EVO 850 (1.8W)

The GTX 770 has 230W TDP and the GTX 1070 just has 150W TDP, with an estimated maximum power consumption of 130W for the rest of the system. The system will never run on full load anyway so I'd guess the PSU would be enough, right?

I even installed the other 19GB from the disk, so I just had to download 13GB!

I have a 16mbps DSL connection and typically download with 14-16mbps on my PC, Xbox One and PS3. At first it downloaded with around 9mbps which is kinda slow and it got progressively worse and now I'm at fucking 200kbps meaning I get around 6-9kB/s and the update just needs another 60MB and I'm fucking angry af because it keeps getting slower. I even did three speedtests and I have an average download of 15mbps, a game like Witcher 3 with 35 gigs downloads within 6 hours and I'm sitting here since 12pm and it still isn't finished!!

My router has Googles DNS as default (8.8.8.8) but I even changed the DNS on the PS directly and everytime I change the network settings the download obviously stops and then I have to pause and unpause it which also takes fucking 15-20 minutes until the download even starts again.

* I also changed it to the OpenDNS, didn't help
* Changed the MTU to the optimal value of 1464, didn't help
* Tried various MTU values ranging from 1450-1500, didn't help
* Changed from LAN to Wifi and back to LAN atleast 3 times, didn't help
* DMZ'ed my PS4, didn't help
* Prioritized all the traffic of my PS4 in QoS settings of my router, didn't help
* Between all this I restarted 4 times which also didn't help
* And the worst thing is waiting fucking 15-20 minutes until the download even starts after every damn change which probably also cost me 2 hours

And btw, my PS4 is connected via a Cat6 cable to a gigabit network, don't go on telling me it's the damn connection, even my PS3 updated some games fine yesterday.

I don't fucking care if you downvote my post, I just need to vent before I really smash this piece of garbage.

Problem is, it only has one NIC (ASUS H81T) and the case does not provide any  PCIe slots (Akasa Galileo) so adding internal hardware isn't possible. USB NICs are probably out of the question so there are two solutions, either getting a managed switch and use VLANs as a workaround for the single NIC or just get myself a mainboard with two NICs.

Since this is a Thin-MiniITX build there is only one mainboard as an option (ASUS Q87T) and it's as expensive as the TP-Link TL-SG3216.

Now I can't decide what's better for me, I actually don't need a managed switch for anything else than creating two VLANs, I've never even done it before. But spending so much money on a mainboard just for the second NIC also feels kinda like wasted money.

There is one last option, I could get a case with a PCIe slot and get myself a half-length MiniPCIe NIC, only problem is I can't find one that has a compatible chipset, if you know one that is compatible or a half-length MiniPCIe to PCIe x1 adapter, then I could save probably half the money.",homelab,pfSense with a single NIC - Buying a managed switch or getting a new mainboard?,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/5556ul/pfsense_with_a_single_nic_buying_a_managed_switch/

The reason why I chose to do it this way is because I don't really like using the -Djava.awt.headless=true parameter, because I can't access every setting via MyJDownloader and I don't wanna copy all the config files from my desktop to my container everytime I wanna change something. An example is setting up the AutoReconnect and also enabling the MyJDownloader interface, which is pretty annoying without a GUI.

I made init.d scripts because my LXC container runs Debian Jessie. Credits go to bcap for his [template](https://gist.github.com/bcap/5397674) which saved me much time.

You can basically apply this guide to any software that has a GUI, you just have to edit the startscripts and the paths to fit your application.

**Requirements**

You need to install following packages:

    x11vnc xvfb openjdk-7-jre

And you need to download the JDownloader.jar which you can get from the [JDownloader homepage](http://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2) below **Other**.

A user with the name and group jdownloader, you can use any user but this is the one that my scripts use, so you have to change them if you want another user.

    adduser jdownloader


**Preparation**

*You need to log in as root user or prepend sudo to every command.*

Now you need to create the jdownloader directory under opt.

    mkdir -p /opt/jdownloader

Put the **JDownloader.jar** into the previously created folder and correct the permissions.

    chown -R jdownloader:jdownloader /opt/jdownloader

Now you also need to add a little startscript which has the DISPLAY variable.

    echo &gt; /opt/jdownloader/jdownloader.sh
    chmod a+x /opt/jdownloader/jdownloader.sh
    vi /opt/jdownloader/jdownloader.sh

Add this to the content:

    #!/bin/bash
    DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/java -jar JDownloader.jar

Log in with your jdownloader user and create a password for the VNC server.

    su - jdownloader
    x11vnc -storepasswd
    exit

Now you can add the startup scripts.

     # Download scripts directly to /etc/init.d
     wget http://pastebin.com/raw/2jDnF9wW -O /etc/init.d/Xvfb
     wget http://pastebin.com/raw/g0rPiQcj -O /etc/init.d/x11vnc
     wget http://pastebin.com/raw/LcADS5bv -O /etc/init.d/jdownloader
     # Give execute permissions
     chmod a+x /etc/init.d/Xvfb /etc/init.d/x11vnc /etc/init.d/jdownloader
     # Add them to the list of startup services
     update-rc.d Xvfb defaults
     update-rc.d x11vnc defaults
     update-rc.d jdownloader defaults

And then **reboot**.

**Usage**

Now connect with any VNC client to your server on port 5900 with your previously set password and voila you can see the JDownloader GUI if you did everything correctly. Now you can also set your MyJdownloader login so you can also access your JD via [MyJDownloader](https://my.jdownloader.org/), this is handy when you don't have a VNC client available or if you wanna use the Android client etc.

**Some tips**

You should disable *Tray Icon* in the settings since there is no tray and you can also set *Bubble Notify* to never since it's not really useful in this scenario anyway.

1.  I'm rather a newbie when it comes to assembling a whole keyboard, I can solder quite okay so that shouldn't be a problem (already RGHd my Xbox 360 successfully), but I have no experience with these DIY kits, how complex is it for a layman to assemble the GH60? Does it come with a manual or something?
2. Am I correct with the assumption that I can also mount Cherry MX switches on the PCB plate? Do they have to be soldered? It's probably a dumb question but since Cherry's are described as ""plate mounted"" I was wondering..
3. I've read that with rev B they implemented slots for LEDs for WASD and some other keys, how about rev C? I'd like to at least get some lighting for typing in full darkness.
4. Since the keycaps I can buy on falbatech are neither translucent nor do they have additional labels, can I get myself some translucent Pok3r keycaps instead, are they compatible? (I'd like to have the labels for the FN functions on the keycaps like the Pok3r has)
5. Is this even a project for someone that has no experience with assembling keyboards? I'm not a complete amateur when it comes to soldering and electronics, but I'd like to know how high the possibility is for me to screw things up, apart from messing up the soldering points because of my shaky hands.

I know the first thing is possible via iptables, but I don't know about the second one, also which is better? Using iptables or using a reverse proxy? I don't really want to install Nginx on every container I have just to get the port redirection...

If this isn't possible with iptables, my router runs dnsmasq and I could run Nginx in another container, could I use SRV records + Nginx? This way I wouldn't have to install Nginx on every container.

For example, my Syncthing container is reachable over syncthing.ho.me and the Nginx container over nginx.ho.me, I also have a container with emby under emby.ho.me. Could I use SRV records which point to the Nginx server which then resolves and redirects?

    _http._tcp.syncthing.ho.me. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 80 nginx.ho.me.
    _https._tcp.syncthing.ho.me. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 443 nginx.ho.me.

    _https._tcp.emby.ho.me. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 443 nginx.ho.me.

Does Nginx even honor SRV records or can it only see A records?

**Edit:** Okay, it seems like this won't work... The only way I see is setting up the Nginx container, use syncthing.ho.me as CNAME for nginx.ho.me and then redirect it to the actual Syncthing server on port 8384 I guess.

I also can't use other PCI slots, I only have one x16 slot on my Supermicro X10SL7-F... 

Here is the output of dmesg, maybe I overlooked something, but it doesn't seem to be an error, it might be just an issue with IOMMU grouping: http://pastebin.com/3GhzmKcE

Can't use other PCI slots, I only have one x16 slot on my Supermicro X10SL7-F... 

Here is the output of dmesg, maybe I overlooked something, but it doesn't seem to be an error, it might be just an issue with IOMMU grouping: http://pastebin.com/3GhzmKcE

**Update:** Seems the Proxmox devs included the ACS override patch into the 3.10 kernel, but not into their 4.2 kernel, which explains everything. That means I have to apply it myself and hope it works.
[Found an easy guide for everyone](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/patch-add-override_for_missing_acs_capabilities-patch.23099/)

**Update2:** Nope acs override patch applied, but didn't fix the iommu grouping issue...

**Update3:** Okay tried Arch with Kernel 4.1.15 and vfio patches, didn't work, I also tried Proxmox pve-kernel 3.10 which worked for most people previously, also didn't work. Seems to be my hardware that doesn't play nice with the iommu grouping. Also can't switch back to ESXi because my TV card doesn't work with ESXi's passthrough. I might try another gpu but that's about it then..

**Update3:** The latest Proxmox kernel fixed my grouping issue, so it was a kernel issue, I dunno what caused this but since it's working now I finally don't give a damn, yay!",linuxmasterrace,Can I force IOMMU grouping?,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/3xtuhr/can_i_force_iommu_grouping/

I currently run Proxmox VE 4, but since there is an issue with IOMMU grouping I can't pass through my GPU and the Proxmox support is awful if you just have a community subscription..

So I wanna switch to Arch, but I'd like to have an easy to use web interface for KVM like Proxmox does, so I wanted to install Archipel, didn't get it to run and I'm way too lazy to figure out what the problem is, I just wanna install it and run it...

Are there any webinterfaces that provide similar features like Proxmox' interface?

I beg of you, please don't tell me to use the CLI or VirtManager. I want a webinterface, please.

**Edit:** Options so far:

 * Kimchi (too basic for me)
 * WebVirtManager (also very basic)
 * Archipel (looks awesome but I don't get it to work)
 * oVirt (also looks awesome, but I don't get it to work either)
 * VMmanager (looks cool, but isn't free, might try the demo)
 * convirt (not free, might try the demo)
 * Foreman (will try, but isn't supported under Arch, but should technically work)

**Update:** I just tried to install Archipel again, after a lot of fiddling I found the issue I had, I used python3 (python2 is required, you also need to symlink python2.7 to /usr/bin/python). Another problem was apscheduler, Archipel needs one below version 3, but if you just use *easy_install2.7 apscheduler*, it'll install 3.0.5, so I used *easy_install2.7 apscheduler==2.1.2* and Archipel finally starts without errors. Then all you have to do is use the ejabberd config which is provided in the Archipel wiki, set the right FQDN in the archipel.conf, ejabberd.yml and ejabberdctl.cfg and you're good to go. Might help someone who wants to set up Archipel too.

**Update2:** So Archipel is not an option, it's still very buggy, maybe because it's a beta, but feels more like an alpha, maybe it's just me... The virtual machine creation still has some flaws, also when I kill guests the UUIDs are still in my contact list. It looks cool but it's a PITA to set up and in the end I'm probably better off using virsh..

back then, when I first got my Gateway I immediately dumped my retail Pokemon X and the damn OCD forced me to wipe my retail cards save game instead of testing the dump first. (I knew there was no gain for me, the OCD was just too strong)

I also found out that at this time, there was no way to restore the save game onto the card or fix the save game of the dump. The only thing I could have done was extract the save game with SaveDataFiler and transfer the 500+ Pokemon from the corrupted save to a new save. But they would have been registered as traded Pokes unless I changed the Trainer ID of all the Pokemon which would take hours.. **Edit:** Ok PkHEX has now the ability to change the TrainerID, so I could change that on my new save game and could transfer the Pokemon without editing them.

But since this more than 9 months ago, maybe there is a way now, to restore the complete save game from the dump, I luckily made a backup from the original dump before wiping the save game.

I know the DS5 is releasing this September, but I don't really need RGB backlighting and I don't need macros, so I want to buy the black DS4 with MX-Reds, I already commited to Massdrop for the Vortex backlit PBT keycaps, so I need the DS4 with ANSI layout, since I want the PBT switches.

The problem is, I can only find ISO layout DS4's on ebay/Amazon etc. and if I buy it from the US I have to pay for customs etc., so I hoped that there is a retailer that ships from the EU so I don't have to pay any customs fees.

https://mechanicalkeyboards.nl/ is the only one I found with the DS4 ANSI, sadly they don't have it in stock so I can't order it from there.. :(

**Edit:** I talked to the support of mechanicalkeyboards.nl and he said he has a DS4 with Red Switches in stock, yay! Just bought one, but for 170€ I could have ordered one from the US and pay for the taxes, but whatever..",MechanicalKeyboards,[buying] Is there any EU retailer for the Ducky Shine 4 with ANSI Layout?,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/3gtyqk/buying_is_there_any_eu_retailer_for_the_ducky/

I wanted to buy a DS4 or maybe the DS5 when it releases this September.
Sadly I had to find out, that Ducky doesn't produce their backlit PBT-Keycap-Sets anymore since two years.. I could find only the grey/blue and cream/green PBT caps for the DS4, but I don't like the color of either and they are not backlit.

Soo are there any backlit PBT keycaps for the DS4?

If not, are there any keyboards that have compatible PBT keycap sets or are shipped with PBT keycaps?
Should also be backlit, have MX-Reds and it must have the tenkeyblock.",MechanicalKeyboards,[buying] Backlit MKB with MX-Red and PBT-Keycap-Sets?,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/3gfxjx/buying_backlit_mkb_with_mxred_and_pbtkeycapsets/

So I bought my Xbox One at the end of April at Amazon, I played for about 3-5 hours mostly on weekends, since I was bored a little I haven't touched it for two or three weeks, now at the 24th of July I wanted to play a little Destiny, started the console aaaand it's gone, blackscreen, it does turn on, but I can't see anything. I tried everything and came to the result, that the HDMI port was defective, just after 4 months, wow.. So I opened a service ticket on myservice.xbox.com, wrapped it up safely and send it to the customer service center in Ireland.

After one week on the next Friday it already came back, I was so happy, so set it up and tried to turn it on. Sadly they didn't fix s**t, so the HDMI port was still defective and the best thing of all, my Xbox was full of scratches and the corner on the front was completely damaged...

I was so damn angry, opened the support page and tried to contact the support via chat, after 10 mins I got a reply blablabla, I'm sorry for you blablabla and I'll receive a replacement. K, wanted to go to myservice.xbox.com and open a new ticket, but I couldn't ""Service is not available"". Ok back to the Xbox support page, waited 45 minutes, had to explain everything again (I also explained that it has scratches all over the place now and the corner was damaged), support staff opened a ticket for me, I sent it back to Ireland yesterday.

Today, I received a mail that some of the staff members in the service center reported that my Xbox has scratches all over the place and I should send them some pictures of the Xbox and the packaging from before I sent it to them. Duh, you were the ones who damaged it last time!!

First of all, I should receive a replacement anyway, so why do I have to send them any proof now??

I should have just called Amazon to get a new one.. Never thought I had such a hard time with Microsoft's support. Not Logitech, not Corsair not any manufacturer until now has never let me down so much like Microsoft did..

**Update:** I can't explain how angry and frustrated I am right now... I replied to the mail, that I didn't take any pictures because there was never a requirement that I had to take any. Now I got an email back which roughly translated says, that she can understand my anger and they will not deny my request for a replacement, but they have ""specific rules"".
So, to forward the case to the technical staff, they need a confirmation, that the console is damaged from the outside, so I have to **take pictures of my console (present tense!!)** and have to send it to them. 
**But how the hell should I take pictures of my console if it's already at their service center in Ireland??!?!?!**
This is the worst experience I have ever had with any support in my life.. 

**Update2:** Well, I had the slight suspicion, that the support member that was contacting me about the pictures twice now, wasn't a speaking my language natively, the german was pretty bad, but I really didn't think, that she seriously put my reply into a translator, because if you put the german sentence ""also kann ich keine Bilder machen"", which means ""so I can't take any pictures"", into the Google translator, it gets translated into ""so I can take any pictures"". That's where the misunderstanding probably comes from, but since I guessed that this support member doesn't speak german, I wrote the last mail in english, so she should at least understand that now. But I'm still waiting for a reply, I'm really curious how she responds..",xboxone,My horrible experience with the Xbox Support,http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/3fr2gx/my_horrible_experience_with_the_xbox_support/

The thing is, I can't decide which one I should take, I'm currently looking at the Ducky Shine 4 and the Ducky Legend, but I'm not sure, maybe there are better ones out there? (It should have Red, White or RGB background lighting)

The thing is, I don't like all this fancy stuff like, audio ports and USB hubs within keyboards and macro buttons, I also don't like the overkill look on some of the ""gaming"" keyboards, like the ones from Roccat or Razer, I like it minimalistic and clean. That's why I love the K70, also the Ducky keyboards look very classic and clean.",MechanicalKeyboards,[buying] Which mechanical keyboard with MX-Red Switches?,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/3fqlhq/buying_which_mechanical_keyboard_with_mxred/

Since I have just 3 tv shows but over 50 anime it's always annoying to select the tv shows.

The thing that bothers me, all of the skins I've tried have widgets, that don't adjust to the new nodes, they use the standard tv shows library to filter for ongoing, latest or random episodes or fanart backgrounds etc. instead of the new nodes..

Are there any skins that have widgets which are adjustable to use custom nodes? I'm pretty sad, that kodi still doesn't differ between anime and tv shows out of the box.. That would make life so much easier.",xbmc,Searching for a nice skin with widgets that support custom nodes,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/3ehl0t/searching_for_a_nice_skin_with_widgets_that/

So I'm thinking about upgrading my library to 1080p or Remux, would it even be worth it? Also do I notice a real difference between proper encoded 1080p and Remuxes? I know the quality of remuxes is generally better, but do I notice this quality improvement?
Thinking about just upgrading my favorites, since I'd have to upgrade my harddisks of my homeserver, if I wanted to do all the movies.

My HTPC has a Celeron 1840T (dual core @ 2.5GHz) CPU, so the high bitrates should be no problem. I think..",torrents,Upgrading my 720p library to 1080p/Remux?,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/3bj80b/upgrading_my_720p_library_to_1080premux/
