something behind/in my sinuses painfully 'melting' inside my head. Messed up my sense of balance.  It happened suddenly, and I feel fine afterwards, but its extremely disturbing. Felt almost like my ear canal collapsed. I had a sinus infection recently but its gone now and ive been off antibiotics for several days.
