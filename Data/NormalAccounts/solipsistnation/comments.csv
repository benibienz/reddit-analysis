10,"For the weathering you're looking at, check out Michael Rinaldi's oil paint rendering techniques. I think you could get pretty good results using that-- some of the examples you have look a little obviously streaky (the streaks on the wall in example 3 look very brushy, if you know what I mean-- curved streaks kind of disrupt the illusion since actual streaks are driven by gravity and flow straight down, right?), but the other stuff looks like careful oil brushing. If you haven't done oil weathering before, I'd recommend getting a shade of umber artists' oils and some turpenoid and giving it a try, maybe on a sacrificial kit first. It's revelatory. So much stuff will suddenly make sense and be within your abilities. 

Don't necessarily buy Abteilung 502 oil paints because they are crappy and expensive though. Hit art stores and look for tubes of paint on sale. 

Also don't use the same brushes for acrylic and oils or you'll mess up the brush and your paints and everything. ",2016-11-17 22:59:26+00:00,da4vry2,1.0,t3_5dhiwb,15071.0,modelmakers

I joined a local book club and I've done a bunch of reading for that in the past couple of months-- the best thing from that is, I think, *Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits* by David Wong, which is a sort of rollicking post-cyberpunk novel about... Uh, hard to say what it's about. A girl who inherits her father's crime empire, more or less? Cybernetically enhanced bros? An extremely smelly cat? It's a blast.

It will drive you mad!

Zero kids, two guinea pigs, mostly signed up so I didn't have to read over coldandsleepy's shoulder. Had just moved to California, leaving behind my whole life in Massachusetts. Ended up being chatty and complaining about bees and learning to cook better from the PPK, read and attempted to understand social justice and privilege stuff, and I think got better at it in general. Made a lot of jokes about bees. Sat around and played video games and walked a little, but was mostly sedentary. 

Reddit PPK me: Older. No longer with C&amp;S. Have 2 kids (50% of the time anyway), zero guinea pigs. Still can cook pretty well, but it's harder to take the time if I'm just cooking for myself or the kids (since they're not always the most appreciative audience). Now pretty much entirely vegan, originally mostly out of habit but I guess I'm not going back and might as well embrace it. I can now bike 50+ miles at once, or run 4 or 5 miles if I feel like it. I'm much healthier in general and I've lost 45 pounds since June. Life has changed in ways I couldn't imagine a few years ago, and while it's been difficult I think it's getting better.

Although that sort of assumes you have a bike and want to ride it... Bike shops often organize beginner rides, so you could ask around there if that's interesting to you. I've found that getting out of the house and riding around makes me feel less isolated, even if it's just me (which it pretty much always is). And it's exercise, which isn't really a bad thing either. That can help with mood stuff, and maybe you'll be tired enough not to care as much that you're crashing out alone in the evening instead of hanging out with people, at least for a while. Getting and actively riding a bike has made a HUGE difference in my mood. I've lost weight, I sleep better... All that stuff helps. 

But yeah, serious sympathy here-- meeting people is hard, and after a while it's hard to even get out of the house, which makes it worse.

269,"Hey, so, this is pretty nice! I like T-55s, and Tamiya's kit is really nice, isn't it? Pin washes on there, if you do them in black or something dark, might just look weird. What I'd do if I were making a similar vehicle (you know, [hypothetically](http://imgur.com/a/hKm7t)) is do a dot filter with oil paints-- give it a solid coat of gloss (you'll want to do that before a pin wash anyway), and then use little dots of both darker colors like sepia and burnt umber and some lighter colors, like caucasian skin tone and, well, not necessarily _white_ since it tends to overwhelm other stuff, but maybe some light browns or dust tones. You can work it around so it looks like it's been driving around in the dust, which is what you'd have seen with a Gulf War tank anyway, right? Vertical streaks of dust colors will add a lot, I think, and break up the base coat so it doesn't look as static. 

If you do a pin wash, don't use solid black-- maybe hit it with a darker tan than the base coat, just to give the idea of wear rather than deep shadows. 

Also, nice job on the fuel lines. That's a pretty cool detail. 8) Man, I love T-55s.

292,"You can do almost any kind of paint (just not, I guess, Windex) over acrylic-- it dries to a thin rubbery film that's pretty much impervious to most paint thinners and water.

Your base coat is very clean-- that's good! It gives you a lot of leeway when you go to do weathering. From where you are now, I would:

- clean up a couple of places where the paint escaped onto the olive drab, like around the vision blocks in the cupola. 

- hit EVERYTHING with a pretty major sepia or burnt umber wash

- hit the fabric bits (around the gun mantlet and the stowage in particular) with a darker brown wash. More burnt umber would work-- you want to give it some contrast between the deeper parts of the canvas and the top parts, which would wear differently and get sun-bleached faster than the parts in shadow.

- Hit the M2 .50 cal on top with a deep black wash. Give it some contrast. You could then go over the edges with a soft lead pencil to give it a metallic sheen. A deep black wash on the engine grilles will make those pop too. 

What's up with the yellowish circle on the jerrycans? It looks a little like it's messy paint, but it's a different color. 

Overall, washes will make everything pop out a little more. Learn to use washes! You'll like what they do. 8)

I got this bike because it seemed like a good match for what I want to do-- commuting 5 days every other week, banging around on fairly smooth trails on weekends, groceries, general going places nearby. I'd been riding first a frankenbike made of random parts from a bike co-op's free parts bins, then a 1990 Bianchi with a little road rash that needs some work. I wanted a bike I could keep solid and reliable while I get the Bianchi stripped down, repainted, fixed up and back together.

It's pretty much stock (I put on double-sided pedals so I can clip in or not). I like it, in general, but I'm withholding judgement on the brakes until I can make sure I've got them set up right.

If you can help it, don't assemble those parts until you've painted in there-- things like tank wheels can be left off until quite late in the build process.

It also helps to paint the nooks first-- that way if you have to do a lot of spraying around them to get everything, you're painting onto bare plastic (or primer) and are less likely to overpaint those areas.

332,"Resin kits are sometimes coated in mold release that won't take paint. Make sure you was the parts in water to get any mold release agent off. 

You'll need to cut and sand off the casting plugs-- be aware that resin dust is SUPER TOXIC and you should either wet sand or actually sand and saw under running water. (I did that with the last resin stuff I did-- just hung out in the bathroom with a razor saw and plastic-backed sandpaper with a little water running. I am personally responsible for the California drought.)  

If parts are warped, you can run warm water on them and gently straighten them out. Warm, NOT boiling or super-hot water or you'll melt the pieces. 

You will need good CA to glue the parts together-- normal plastic model cement won't work. If the parts don't seem to have a big contact point you may want to drill little holes and use bits of wire to reinforce the joint, but you shouldn't need to. 

You may need to fill bubbles and gaps in the resin-- you can use normal model putty for this, or Apoxie Sculpt (my favorite-- it's much easier to work with than model putty), both of which will of course require more sanding... The joints may require filler too, so plan on doing some putty work before you can paint it. 

Prime before painting, especially if you did much with filler putty. 

You will probably break the little tiny hose parts. This isn't a commentary on your skills or anything, it's just that they look really fragile and resin breaks easily. Ask me about regluing parts like 30 times. :/

That's pretty much it. 

Just so you know, E2046 are recasters-- their kits (especially the Ma.K stuff) are pretty much pirated copies of the originals (either from Wave or Hasegawa). Wave makes modern plastic versions of Ma.K stuff it's kind of silly to buy recasts. (Especially since HLJ has them for under $20.00 US.) With some stuff I wouldn't care too much, but Kow Yokoyama is generally pretty cool with his fans and stuff. There's no sub policy or anything on recasts or pirated kits, but I try to support the original kitmakers rather than recasters whenever possible. Plus they got the box art wrong. One of those pictures is a SAFS Snowman.

Finer hairs (sable or whatever) are better for smaller brushes and smooth detail painting. 

I go to the art store, look at how things are listed, and go by that. Usually the racks of brushes recommend the kinds of paint they're for. Mostly I pick up brushes recommended for oils or acrylics. I seem to mostly use Princeton brushes, but that's probably just what's been on sale.

They fit pretty well, they look pretty good (but aren't super accurate, in case you care about that), and they don't have a million over-engineered parts. They're cheap enough that if you mess them up you aren't out 60 or 80 bucks for a modern kit. They're pretty much ideal for learning to deal with model kits and plastic and stuff. 

The M41 Walker Bulldog, Panzer II ausf F/G, T-62 and Kampfpanzer Leopard are all pretty good places to start. Serious rivet-counters will get huffy about all of them, but don't be a serious rivet-counter. Build tanks, have fun. 8)

388,"I like both. When I started out, I really liked building-- I like Legos, I get my furniture from Ikea, I built my synthesizer from kits ( www.synthrotek.com has a lot of my money...) and I like gluing plastic together. Over time, I started appreciating painting more, though, and learning techniques and stuff so it got less tedious and more interesting to me. Getting an airbrush was a REALLY big deal-- it meant I could get a nice smooth base coat down without having to fart around too much or do multiple layers. If I had to paint everything like 4 times to get it looking good I would never have bothered-- instead I can airbrush it and bam, instant nice-looking paint! 

As /u/windupmonkeys suggested, here's a picture of two models I built about a year apart:

http://i.imgur.com/f5bQqaz.jpg

They're more or less the same kit, but the one on the right is painted with rattlecan spraypaint, and the one on the left is airbrushed and has some pretty simple weathering using cheap ground-up chalk pastels. 

I built this which I'm fond of, but boy, it has some issues:

http://i.imgur.com/jUJ32qN.jpg

(You can see I didn't paint between the road wheels... This was before I realized you should keep the wheels off and paint them BEFORE gluing them to the hull...)

Two years or so later, I put a solid four or six months into a T-55A, including resin upgrade parts and metal parts and fancy metal tracks, and came up with this:

http://imgur.com/a/hKm7t

...which won a prize at this year's model show in San Jose. 

The thing I think you're seeing is that the process of building a model is (usually) less artistic than the painting. When you're building, you know what it will end up as. You have a pile of parts and a book of instructions, and you follow it, and do some cleanup as you go maybe, and you end up with a tank or whatever that looks like a real tank somewhere. Painting is when you get personal-- you choose the country, the paint scheme, the condition of the vehicle (Factory fresh? Out in the field? Found in a lake?), and so on, and you get to make lots of little decisions and make the model your own. My T-55A is my own-- I picked a real tank I liked and made my tank look like it. Without the paint, though, it's just a generic tank. 

There are some exceptions, of course-- you can do some modification, or add details and fancy parts to make an unpainted model unique too, but without making the vehicle so unique it's not really the same thing any more, it's more limiting. Does that all make sense?

When the hubs are dry, paint half of each tire. (Half because you have to hold onto the other half, right?) Use a small brush and sort of drag it around the ridge by the tire very slowly to get the edge nice and sharp. Let that dry and paint the other half of the tires. Then go back and touch up anyplace where paint got onto the wheel. That should get you some nice tires... 

Finally, hit the whole thing with a darkish wash and you can get away with some sloppy edging without too much trauma. 

I wouldn't bother with masking for brush painting, though-- it's just going to take a while. :/

So you use a lighter color and apply just a tiny bit of it from a mostly-dry brush so the raised bits get a little contrast compared to the base coat. I suppose you could dry-brush a darker color too, for a different effect. Usually you use washes (very thin paint, like a 10-1 water-to-paint ratio or thinner) to fill in shadows like panel lines, or around the base of raised details. 

So yeah, you could use that mix, dip the very tippy tip of your brush in it and then wipe it off on a paper towel until it's almost clean and you can see that when you brush on the towel you're mostly highlighting the fibers of the towel. Then brush it very lightly over the details a couple of times to transfer a teensy bit of paint. You might have to do it a couple of times for it to show up.

With oils, you can get a lot out of just a couple of colors, and you really don't need the more expensive tubes-- if there's one brand of paint with two similar colors and one color is more expensive, I've always gotten the cheaper one (and it's usually something like $16 vs $8) and I have no complaints. You're going to be thinning and blending and squishing them around anyway. 

Anyway, stick with the artist oils and get 3 or 4 tubes of interesting stuff. They'll go a long long way, so even dropping 6-8€ isn't too bad if you think of it as something you'll be using for 5 or 6 years.

- burnt umber

466,"Both! What will happen is, the primer will give you a nice smooth surface, or it should-- raised seams or divots or whatever will show up much more on a clean smooth white surface than they do on bare plastic, especially since bare plastic gets a different finish and color even when it's been sanded really really smooth, so you can't feel it. It can be hard to tell what's going to show up when you paint it. Hit it with primer, you'll be able to see every detail very clearly. 

So, you can sand down raised parts, or fill and sand holes or whatever and prime over that part so it looks nice before you do the real base coat and so on. Does that make more sense? 

Primer also helps a lot if you have metal parts on the model, since it'll give plastic and metal a consistent surface and should be grippier when it dries so acrylic will stick better to it than it would to the metal. Same with resin parts, which sometimes show up oddly if they're not primed.

471,"Also, what I'd do is this:

1. Build the entire hull. Leave the wheels off. Maybe wrap little flags of masking tape around the axles so you don't paint over them. 

2. Apply filler on the hull if needed. You probably won't need much, if any, since it's Tamiya. 

3. Prime everything, including the wheels. 

4. Get a base coat on the hull and wheels. 

5. Paint the tires and do other detail painting on the hull. 

6. Do your first pass of washes/weathering/whatever on the hull, especially whatever you're going to do on the lower hull where it might be difficult to do after you've attached the wheels.

7. Do similar weathering on the wheels so they match the hull. 

8. Paint the tracks. Be really careful with those damn rubber bands. Better yet, throw them away and get some Friul tracks. They look really nice and hold paint better. The Friul AMX 13 tracks are very nice. If you're using Friul's, assemble as a long run (that is, don't make a loop yet, but leave a long piece of wire stuck through the holes on each end so you don't fill them up with paint) and paint and weather them. 

9. Remove the masking tape from the axles and push the wheels onto the axles, but NOT the drive sprocket. Pushing them on should be easy since Tamiya uses poly caps so the wheels will turn if you want. 

10. If you're using the rubber band tracks, loop the first track around the drive sprocket, loop the other end of the track around the idler, and sort of slide it over the wheels and return rollers. Press the drive sprocket into place. This should get the tracks in place without stretching them too much, and ideally without damaging whatever painting you did on them. Be prepared for paint to not stick well. I hate that kind of tracks. :(

11. If you're using Friul tracks, loop them around the top of the run so the ends are on the bottom under the road wheels. Pull out the placeholder wires and stick in a single piece to hold them in place and glue it so it doesn't fall out. 

12. Do whatever final weathering you're going to do (this is where I'd pull out the oils and get all streaky, but it's up to you). 

13. Dullcote the hell out of it to protect the paint and everything.

14. Admire your swanky tank. 

Note that the instructions might have you put the wheels on earlier. Don't ever put the wheels on before painting the hull if you can help it! It's so hard to paint behind them...

A couple of questions-- how long did you dip them in the water before applying them? I had very bad luck with decals before I realized I was leaving them in the water for too long. You should just swirl them and count to ten, then set them on a paper towel (to wick off the excess) for a minute or so until they slide. 

Micro Set may help you-- if you get one of the 2 Micro-S* things, that's the one to get. (You should get both if you're gonna get serious. They do last a long time, at least.) What I do these days is put on a gloss coat (Future) where the decals go, brush a little Micro Set on there and then slide the decal off and onto the Micro Set spot. While it's wet you can VERY carefully slide it around and get it lined up right (I use the rounded tip of a paintbrush handle to slide them around) and then DON'T TOUCH IT until it dries. (I've also managed to poke a decal while applying another decal and destroyed it. :/ ) Once it dries, you can hit it with a little Micro Sol-- it'll get gross and wrinkly and then settle down and look really nice. Then, once all that is dry, clearcoat over it with more Future or whatever you're using as a base for any weathering you're going to do. That'll protect them and seal them in good so you don't destroy them by accident later on. 

I managed to trash the side decals on my Czech Hetzer, and I had to search around and find aftermarket replacements. The decals are super important on that, so I couldn't just fudge it and put a bunch of mud on there or anything-- I had to replace it or trash the build, and I was so far into it....

For either one, it may be worth picking up the Friulmodel metal tracks (Takom has plastic links, Tamiya has rubber band tracks. The Friuls look really nice-- here's mine:

I recommend super thin glue and a glue applicator, or thicker glue applied with a toothpick-- you can apply CA the same way you apply thin plastic cement, but thick CA can get messy quickly and CA in general will bond your skin instantly, so you have to be pretty careful with it. Look for something like a Glue Looper if you really want to get into CA.

You will probably also get better results painting if you prime the metal before painting it. Primer sticks really well to both plastic and metal, and will give everything a uniform finish so the metal parts won't be obviously a different material than the plastic.

I like how the tracks were printed. Aside from that guy and his large-scale T-80 from a year or two ago, this is the best 3d-printed model I've seen so far. I wish he'd gone more for accuracy than functionality, but oh well. 8)

And even in WW2, sandbag and track armor often made hits from early HEAT weapons (Panzerfausts and things) worse. They weren't necessarily well-designed, so sometimes the extra armor would make it so the focus of the plasma jet from the shaped charge was actually on the armor instead of a little ways inside it, enhancing its effect on the target. It helped the morale of the crews, though, so they didn't discourage tankers from adding sandbags and things if it made them feel better about driving into battle.

657,"I usually try to use the paint called out by the manufacturer, but I like to paint with Vallejo (model paint and model air) and not all kitmakers give the right numbers for all sorts of paint. Usually you can depend on Tamiya and Humbrol, and maybe Mr Color or Mr Aqueous Color if it's a Japanese kit, but otherwise it's a toss-up.

There are some ways to figure out what to use-- there are a couple of phone apps linked in the siedebar that do paint translation (""Humbrol acrylic XXX is very similar to Vallejo Model Air xx.xxx"", for example) or you can use other references. You don't _have_ to paint your models the same way as the instructions say. Sometimes the instructions are simplified, or they're just not your favorite camo pattern or you want to depict a specific vehicle you have a photo of or something. In that case, you can spend pretty much as much time as you have digging around and attempting to match paint to blurry photos or whatever. Sometimes somebody has already done it, but sometimes that will be weird or hard to follow-- for fun sometime, look for ways to mix up Israeli Sand Grey (it's gotten easier since Vallejo put out some decent paints specifically made for Israeli vahicles, but it used to be pretty tough-- this was my reference for my old AMX-13: http://idfmodelling.free.fr/article01.html ), or, ha ha ha, Panzer Dunkelgelb. Good luck with that one. 

Also, if you're comfortable painting with a specific brand of paint, you might as well stick with it. Having duplicate colors made by different companies just clutters up your workspace. Tamiya models are going to call out Tamiya paints, but if you like Humbrol, use Humbrol! (Tamiya paint is pretty thick anyway and doesn't always brush nicely-- that's why I switched to Vallejo.) 

TL;DR: Don't buy a lot of paint if you already have the colors; apps are listed in the sidebar; don't look at me, man, he was dead when I got here.

The only things that weren't built from kits are the Doepfer modules, and I bought those used.

I would have built that instead but I didn't find it until after I'd bought the Doepfer.)

724,"Yep, figures are allowed, but you might get better feedback from /r/minipainting. 

I think your little dudes probably would have benefited from some seam cleanup-- you can zip the mold lines off pretty easily without damaging the figure by taking the back of an xacto knife and running it back and forth over the seam. It'll take it right off, but since the back isn't very sharp it's not likely to damage the other parts of the figure. 

I also think your guys would benefit from some washes-- my (pretty limited) experience with figures leads me to believe that once you have the base colors down, the best thing you can do is hit them with some pin washes to accentuate the shadowy places. The one shouting guy's face, for example (since he's got a flesh-tone mouth-- eek!) and the folds in their uniforms would all really pop if you gave them a wash with a complementary color (I'd go black for the face and darker green for the uniforms). 

This guy here isn't perfect at all:

http://i.imgur.com/TLg6mT6.jpg

...but you can see how the folds in his sleeves pop out a bit more. That's a darker wash over the lighter base coat. Same with the texture on his vest thing. (I'm still terrible at painting eyes. I think I left him pink and eyeless...)

But for better advice ask on /r/minipainting. 8)

1. Testor's Model Master glue-- it comes in a funny-shaped bottle with a needle applicator thingy.

It doesn't take much.

2. Super thin cement-- Tamiya Super Thin, Plastruct Bondene, something like that. You can use a brush to apply it to joints-- paint it on both surfaces and press together until they stick (which should take only a few seconds)-- or a glue applicator like a Glue Looper (if you want to get fancy! They are quite nice though.) or a needle stuck in a dowel, with one end cut off the loop so you get a tiny little metal fork. You can pick up a drop in the little fork and hold it to a joint and capillary action will suck the glue into the joint and it will be bonded almost instantly. You can do the same sort of thing with super thin CA (superglue), too, if you're attaching metal or resin parts.

It seems to think you'll need a 1 ohm resistor. 

I got curious about this, since you're describing more or less an LED throwie, and found this:

http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2009/some-thoughts-on-throwies/

Turns out if you're doing LED stuff and want it to last more than a few days or a week, you DO want a resistor in there. (Especially if part of the thing you're building will be sealed inside a model and hard to get open to change the battery.) And as long as you're hooking up a battery and resistor, you might as well put in a switch so you can turn it off when you don't want it lit. 

4 bucks plus postage from Japan is a lot for a resistor and some wire. The EMS store there may have stuff that might work. (He sells some neat stuff, anyway.) Most models with lights in them, I think, also tend to use a single light source and optic fiber to get the light into the windows or whatever.

Just those two, just the ones next to him.

To his credit, the kid stayed in there for another hour or so.

I'm not happy with the tow cables-- it's funny, everything else is so beautifully detailed, and they give you the options of thread (which is underscale and hard to get looking nice) or these sort of half-assed plastic pieces.

891,"Mmm, I'm going to disagree.

Get a double-action airbrush to start with, since you'll want one before too long anyway. Something like a Badger Patriot 105 would be a good starter, I think. They're pretty easy to maintain, aren't too picky about paint (although you'll need to thin some things anyway), and are gravity-fed so you can spray at lower pressure and not use as much paint. A single-action airbrush is going to be hard to deal with since you can only turn the paint on and off, and have no control over how much you're spraying. Yeah, there are more moving parts in a double-action, but you'll appreciate it. 

No matter what kind of airbrush you get, you will need to learn to break it down and clean it inside and out. This isn't _too_ difficult, but like any complex tool, if you don't maintain it it will fail. I have a couple of Badger airbrushes and they're easy to strip down and clean and get back together. 

I started out with a Badger 350, and while it was very simple to paint with and clean, it was only a couple of months before I realized why double-action brushes are useful and I should have gotten one in the first place. Skip that step and save yourself some time and money. 8)

So, it's not bad! There are a couple of things you could do to improve next time-- it looks like you didn't let either the brown or the green camo dry completely before painting the other color next to it, and it ran a little. Or if you're using enamels, it may have attacked the other color a little. Either way, try to make sure one color is completely dry or cured before painting next to it. You might also think about using masking tape (like Tamiya tape, or something that won't pull paint off...)-- cut the camo shapes into it and use that to make off the hard edges. NATO camo isn't quite hard-edged so you can get away with a little more, too. (If you're painting with acrylic, it dries pretty fast, but still needs to cure before you paint right next to or over it.)

Bright metal is pretty much always out-of-place on a modern vehicle-- stuff like the tow cable should probably be a sort of grey/black or black/brown steel color, washed with black. The little silver bits over the tires might benefit from being drybrushed, too, rather than painted normally... Drybrushing can be hard depending on your brush and paint, though, but it's worth learning how to do.

Learning to use washes will definitely help you make better models-- make sure you glosscoat before it though. You can get decent glosscoats in spraycans-- Testor's make a good one. Glosscoat, then decals, then another glosscoat to seal in the decals, then washes and weathering. 

A lot of this stuff is more challenging in 1/72, too-- it's harder to paint detail. You need a teeeeeensy little brush and stuff. 

Anyway, it's a MUCH better start than anything I did when I was starting out. 8)

Aside from being really tiny, though, this is a REALLY well-engineered kit! Everything fits, sprue gates are in sensible places that are hidden when it's assembled, it's not over-engineered (that is, it doesn't have lots of tiny parts for things that could be made in single parts), and even as tiny as it is, it's been a total pleasure to build.

A filter is much like a wash-- paint thinned down 10:1 or more so it's very thin and transparent. Except where a wash is applied on gloss and should seep into panel lines and build up around hull or fuselage details, a filter is applied over the whole thing to give some tonal variation to large areas of color. Think of oil paint dot filters (where you dot oil paints all over a model and then use thinner to spread it out, drawing it downward like rain or dust streaks), or even of a wash applied over a matte surface so it sinks in where it's applied instead of pooling in surface details.

Paints and stuff are pretty tough. I packed all my Vallejo stuff in one layer in the bottom of a box, put a piece of cardboard over them, put on other paints and tools and stuff. I have various little boxes and stuff, and cups to hold paintbrushes, so I just put those in as they were. Then I moved them separately from everything else-- I didn't throw them in the moving truck with everything, I packed them in my car so I could keep them separate and make sure they didn't get crushed. I tend to try to keep that stuff pretty organized to begin with, so I could move boxes of stuff without unpacking them just to repack them, and various types of things together with other things of the same type, so a box of various paint thinners and solvents, a box of glues and other stuff in little bottles, and so on. 

I packed built model kits in largish tupperware boxes-- like, wide flat ones. In-progress kits I packed in loaf-of-bread-sized plastic storage boxes with instructions and parts. 

Kits I packed in some largish boxes together. My little compressor I just set on the floor on the passenger's side of the car. All of this stuff I moved on its own separately during a prep visit to our new place, and it all arrived without too much trauma.

Tamiya seems to have gone for a pretty generic configuration (no Israeli additions or later updates) so it seems like it should match something I could find. 

That's all pretty nitpicky, anyway. It's all better than Heller's incoherent blobs of plastic. 8)

993,"The Tamiya kit arrived today, so I dug around to see how it compares to Takom.

TL;DR: They're both nice but the Tamiya kit is a little easier to build while the Takom kit has a little more detail.

Longer form:

That's pretty much it. Takom depicts the all-metal version of those tracks, while Tamiya depicts the version with rubber track pads. Takom is shipping individual-link plastic tracks of the version with rubber pads separately, too, in case you want to put Takom tracks on your Tamiya tank or something. And of course there are always the very nice Friulmetal sets of both versions. 

Honestly, both kits have really great parts and are generally quite good. I definitely prefer hard plastic to anything flexible (like the turret seal) so that brings Tamiya up a bit in my estimation, but Tamiya's tracks are rubber-bandy enough that I will probably get something aftermarket for it when I build it. 

Which would I recommend? Depends on your skill level and desire to put up with some fiddly metal bits. Like metal and individual links? Takom. Otherwise, Tamiya. I think it's pretty great that where once we had one bad choice, we now have two kits good enough that I'd have to think about it before recommending one over the other!

Merkavas drive around in the desert, and get filthy and dusty-- more dust then mud, though, and they don't get rained on much so there probably won't be much rust streaking. Dig up some photoreference (image search on ""Merkava tank"") and you'll find lots of inspiration. Use mostly light oils for dust streaks-- caucasian skin tone, light browns, maybe yellows, TINY amounts of white (it tends to overwhelm everything else), and you should be able to get it to come out nice. And if it doesn't some paint thinner will strip the oils and you can do it a different way. 8)

(And you don't need fancy model builder oils-- find an art store or a craft store, look for the tubes of oil paints, and pick up a couple of whatever is on sale. Don't spend more than 10 bucks for a tube of paint, and if that seems like a lot, consider that it'll still last you through a lot of models.

For glue, you can get thin cement and a little pointy brush and use capillary action to get only as much glue on there as you need. Hold the parts together, dip the brush in the cement and touch it to the seam and it should suck in the cement. Hold it together with gentle pressure (not too much, since you're melting the plastic!) and you should be able to get a nice clean seam. Add more glue to larger seams if you need to. When I'm using thicker glue (like Testor's Model Master cement in the odd-shaped bottle, or there's a Humbrol version-- they usually have some kind of needle appicator, which I mostly don't use) I put some in a little dish, like a bottlecap, and use a toothpick to put glue only where I need it. That keeps things pretty clean... 

If you don't have a good work surface, maybe you could get a piece of cardboard, or cut down a box into a flat tray with an inch or so of rim around the edges, and work in there. That way stuff won't roll away too far, and when you're done for the day you can pick up the tray and put it somewhere safe while glue dries and so on.

That's almost always a huge pain to get cleaned up and looking good, though-- that's why aftermarket metal barrels exist... 

Usually I cement the halves together and try to get them aligned as well as I can by eye and hand. (Don't get cement on your fingers, though, or it'll be a huge mess.) Then, once it dries, I use the back of my knife (the non-sharp part) to sort of smooth the seam by zipping it back and forth along the barrel. Between this and careful sanding (being careful not to make a flat spot on the side...) I can _usually_ get a 2-part barrel looking good, but not always. :/

Is this the old Tamiya kit? There's a lot of molded-on stuff on the sides that look like old Tamiya molding... A little detail painting can help stuff like the canister and jack on the mudguard pop out a bit. Check photos for color and stuff. 

Also, it's easier to completely paint the wheels if you paint them before you put them on...

And finally, you can make the engine grills on the back look more like grills with a dark wash-- same with the hinges and stuff. A wash will make them look more like functional parts and less like molded-on lumps. I think some pin washes are the thing that would help the most here. Overall it's pretty good for a second build ever! You've got a pretty good handle on stuff like wear locations and chipping, and I don't see any silvering on the decals, so you've got a good start. 8)

(Don't build the thing you most in the world want to build yet, because this is just to have something mess up and learn from, and it's really easy to get discouraged if you mess up your favorite tank or plane or whatever. And don't start with a fancy kit with metal parts or resin or whatever-- go with just plastic.) Build it straight out-of-box, don't add aftermarket parts or anything. Learn the basic stuff-- cleaning up parts, tidy gluing, sanding and filling gaps, and so on. Keep in mind that this is something you're going to have to learn and it's not always easy (especially if you have a poorly-designed kit-- to start off, stick with Tamiya or similar well-engineered kits). 

When you're done, look at how it came out, and be critical. Figure out what worked and what didn't work. Think about how you did stuff, and how you could do it better next time. Pick another kit; repeat. 

Everyone here who is building nice-looking models has embarrassing gluey wrecks somewhere in the back of the closet, or orange-peely paint, or big gaps at the base of the wings or visible mold lines or whatever.

1065,"1. Acrylic over acrylic will work as long as you don't thin the wash with something that will attack the base coat. Thin with water or rubbing alcohol and you'll probably be fine. (Don't thin Tamiya acrylic with alcohol though, and maybe test whatever you're doing on a piece of scrap before you hit your model with it.)

Mineral spirits or paint thinner will not attack acrylic, so you should be fine with that. I use odorless turpenoid from the art store, which works nicely over acrylics. 

The (very) short form is:

- there are 2 main kinds of paint, acrylic (mostly water-based) and solvent-based (enamel and oils-- and lacquers to some extent, although Tamiya acrylic is actually an acrylic lacquer so it gets confusing). Once acrylic dries, it becomes pretty much impervious to most solvents-- paint thinner won't touch it, neither will mineral spirits. Ammonia-based cleaners _will_ attack acrylic though (Windex, Simple Green) so don't put that on dried acrylic you want to keep. 

- Dried enamel and oils are still vulnerable to paint thinners (mineral spirits, turpentine), include the thinner in enamel that makes enamel brushable. This means that if you're painting enamel over enamel and the base coat hasn't entirely cured, you can easily strip it off. And if you're painting thinned oils over enamel they can start to lift the paint and wreck your base coat. 

- so, the reason people suggest alternating types of paints is because that makes it easier to keep track of what attacks what. 

- often the easiest thing to do is to just alternate pigmented paint with an acrylic clear coat, usually glossy. I use Future or Alclad II Aqua Gloss between layers, before washes and over decals and so on. They're pretty tough acrylics and are very hard to damage by anything but Windex or Simple Green.  

2. Yes, you pay for convenience and a handy bottle with a label. And if you don't use a lot of oils it can be way more expensive to buy a big can of turpenoid and a bunch of tubes of oils (which can be 8 or 10 bucks a tube) only to use a tiny dab of them. And you might not want a big can of flammable liquid kicking around your house... 

3. Look for ""oil paint dot filter"" for some other oil examples. Your example looks like it was given a sludge wash of oils, let dry for a bit, and then wiped down with something like a cottonball damp with thinner. Probably raw umber or light brown oils. 

The nice thing about oils is that even after they're dried, you can hit them with a little thinner and either remove them or manipulate them some more. This makes them very forgiving. I think they're some of the best part of model painting-- they're really easy to get looking good, and if you mess it up you can always fix it. You should probably just get some oils and thinner and give it a try. 8)

(Oh, a side note-- don't use the same brushes for acrylic and solvent-based paints-- try to keep them separate since they may goop each other up and wreck your brushes. Also, synthetic brushes may not work well with solvents, so pay attention to how they're marked when you go brush shopping. If a brush says it's for watercolors or acrylics the bristles may not react well to turpentine...)

The parts and tooling for that stuff isn't cheap, not to mention the code and CPU to make stuff respond to real-time controls without the zipper effect, and more complex modulation routing, and so on. These days I think it's a combination of cost and tradition, since there's a specific mod wheel message defined as part of the MIDI protocol, and if you wanted more mod wheel stuff you'd need to send control changes, and those aren't necessarily well-supported (or supported at all) by everything... 

The Korg Prophecy had pitch bend, mod, and a sort of weird log controller that could roll up and down on its (spring-loaded) long axis AND had a sort of pressure-sensitive touch strip running along the top, so you had 3 axes of modulation (up/down, left/right, and pressure). The Korg Z1 simplified that by just putting a touchpad there. 

That super expensive Yamaha physical modeling synth had pitch bend and 2 mod wheels, too. Roland stuff for a while got less complex, though, with pitch on a left/right lever and modulation provided by pushing the lever forward. 

But you should check out the Prophecy. It's pretty fun to play.

You should be able to get some good sounds out of the Triton-- I have a Triton Rack, and it's quite capable. You're going to have to learn to program it, though, and if you're not set up for sampling with it, do that. You should be able to add RAM relatively cheaply, although the only storage option is SCSI disks and that may get expensive and be kind of a pain if you don't already have the SCSI option and a disk kicking around. 

A lot of the 90's industrial guys were also using 80's samplers and stuff, and usually started off with relatively cheap gear. Skinny Puppy did a LOT with an Ensoniq Mirage, one of the earliest and jankiest consumer samplers out there. Learning to manipulate samples is going to be key for that sound.

There are also 1/35 kits that don't have a lot of detail and have relatively few parts-- the less expensive Tamiya kits (M41 Walker Bulldog, Panzer II, anything under US$20) are very easy to put together. If you want to build armor, I'd suggest starting with one of those.

1212,"Yeah, the tape thing was just because the computer at the time was too slow to generate audio at audio frequencies. These days things like CSound can run in realtime. Every time you use a software synthesizer, you are using a (at least spiritual) descendant of the software Lansky used back in the day. (If you play a DX7 or use FM synthesis, it's more than a spiritual descendant, too.)

I am pretty sure Lansky has the code somewhere, but I doubt he'd give it out. It's pretty likely not in a recognizable textfile format, and computers back then often used ways of storing files that seem very alien to us these days. (EBCDIC vs ASCII, different byte sizes, different word sizes, not using file systems and directories the way we use them today, for a few examples.) Even if we had it, we don't have Music360 to compile it on. 

Here is an example of the score (a couple of pages down):

Remember that this is WAY before MIDI or digital synthesis in any form that was affordable to a normal person or even most musicians. A computer at that point was most likely a mainframe, and personal computers were very very primitive. 

He wrote the program, keyed it into punchcards, loaded it into the IBM mainframe, which compiled it and ran it and wrote PCM-encoded digital audio to what I think was probably a 9-track computer tape (you know, the spinny reels of tape you see on old computers in movies). He then took it to a lab that had a DAC to play it-- that would have been another pretty specialized piece of equipment in 1973, and probably something you wouldn't have run into much outside of universities or other research labs. 

The program, it sounds like, would define software ""instruments"" as functions that took arguments for pitch and duration and maybe other stuff (think modulation inputs). He'd then define the score as a series of calls to those instrument functions. 

Does that make sense? This is REALLY early digital synthesis, and all the fancy stuff that lets us play back samples and even FM synthesis in real-time (hit a key, get a sound) was ten years in the future.",2016-02-20 19:46:06+00:00,d07bhg7,4.0,t1_d07b11r,834.0,synthesizers

1222,"Yeah-- model builders are largely idiosyncratic, too. You'd have to aim for the lowest common denominator of what people like to build, so it would probably be a bunch of German tanks and the occasional Sherman, or whatever the equivalent is for aircraft. (""Another Spitfire? I'll put it on the pile."")

Airfix could probably pull it off-- they have a lot of low-cost stuff they wouldn't have to go to a lot of trouble to make and deliver. For $10/month a younger builder could get a little tank or plane to build and if they didn't like that month's kit they wouldn't be out 30 bucks or whatever. But like you say, after a while I think the appeal would fade.

I can see why it would seem like a good idea, though-- if you listen to podcasts much it seems like they're all sponsored by these companies that will ship you random crap in a box. Snacks, clothing, meal ingredients and recipes, underwear(!), and on and on and on until suddenly every couple of days you get some random pile of junk in the mail. I went and looked at where they're coming from, and discovered several companies that are just box-of-crap-logistics-for-hire places! You sign up, drop ship them a pallet of stuff, and they package and mail it for you. And there are several of these companies, each of which is shipping hundreds of potential box-of-crap subscriptions.

So yeah, I wouldn't get into this market right now, especially not with something super specialized. The only way somebody is going to make money on it today is to push it hard and get out quick before the box-of-crap market collapses, which I'm guessing will be 6-12 months from now.

1224,"It's a powered mixer-- it's for a PA system. I'm guessing it's aimed at churches or presenters since it has 3 microphone inputs and one channel for music and separate outputs for front and back speakers. You'd hook up (I'm guessing) 4 speakers to it-- a set in the front of the church and a set at the back of the church (so people in back can hear too), and then microphones for the preacher or motivational speaker and whoever else might be on-stage. 

You can turn the music up and down in the front and back of the house separately, and you can adjust the level of each microphone on its own and adjust whether the microphones come more out of the front or back speakers with the ""MIC FADER"" knob. 

This is a single unit that combines what is often sold as 2 separate devices-- a mixer (that you plug the microphones and CD player or the band or whatever into) and an amplifier (that takes that mix and makes it loud and plays it through loudspeakers. So it's a mixing power amplifier (as they call it), or a powered mixer. 

This one is kind of interesting since it has reverb-- that is, a little bit of echo-- built in. 

I can't tell you more without seeing the back of the unit. I'm going to go see if I can find a picture now.

EDIT: Okay, it's for karaoke. Plug the CD player audio into the music input, plug the singers' microphones into the microphone inputs, hit play and go to town. That explains the reverb, since it'll help make people's voices sound a little fuller and mix them into the music a little better. (Reverb wouldn't make sense for a church-type PA system.)

A vehicle coming out of the factory will have markings on it, and will be clean. It will then go out and drive or fly around and get dirty and scratched up. Those markings (represented by decals) will also get dirty and scratched up. 

Does that make sense?

And for drybrushing vs washes: Washes accentuate shadows and darker, sunken areas of the vehicle. Drybrushing accentuates highlights, the raised parts of the vehicle. 

Again, think about what decals are vs. what the paint is going to represent. An insignia would be painted across panels, even if there are grooves between the panels, but obviously wouldn't end up sort of bridging the gap between panels the way a giant sticker on a real airplane would. So for a model where you have a decal that crosses between hull panels or wings and flaps or something, you'd put on the decals, clearcoat over them, and then do panel line pinwashes over the decal.

Looks like the road wheels just stick onto the axles-- no hub arrangement, no easy easy way to make them turn. If you want to make it drivable the Tamiya kit is probably a better bet. Or the Heller kit DOES have axles that go all the way through and attach to external hubs so you don't have to glue the wheels on directly, but good luck with that. 8)

1312,"HLJ has Takom's new AMX 13s in stock, so I ordered 2 of them! And now, in case you're curious, here are some comparisons. There are 3 turrets there-- the painted-up one is my old Heller AMX 13. I added a little detail when I built it and tried to fix some of its terrible wrongness, but you can see it's big and poorly-detailed compared to both the FL10 turret from the Hobby Boss EBR 10 turret and the Takom turret. Not really a surprise, I guess. 

The HB and Heller turrets are both a little longer and wider than the Takom turret-- I'd have to go measure things to figure out which is more accurate. I'm not TOO worried about it, honestly. 

The Takom hull is molded in super thin plastic-- both of the hulls I received were warped in the box. It's nothing a little bit of hot water won't fix (or just gluing in some braces and clamping it) but it'll take extra work. It's a nice slide-molded piece, though, so it's hard to complain too much. 

I'm not thrilled with the big rubber turret seal-- I don't know if it'll take paint or what. I like it better than Heller's vaguely-detailed version, which didn't really fit right and pretty much would have had to have been rebuilt with putty in order to actually go around the turret at all. Hobby Boss has a plastic one that I'm also not using because I just think it looks bad in general. This is at least good-looking, if soft and annoying. Somebody will probably make it look good, but it won't be me. 

Detail on the drive sprockets is quite nice:

http://i.imgur.com/19RFkeC.jpg

Here are Heller's and a real one for comparison:

http://i.imgur.com/TUnz4ax.jpg

The kits are entirely identical aside from the one sprue with the guns and the over-track stowage boxes. Same PE fret, same clear parts, different decals and instructions and painting guides. 

I'm not entirely thrilled with the molded-on canvas gun seal on the 13/90, but I can live with it. It's nicely-done, anyway.

The brushguards for the headlamps are interesting-- there's a plastic frame, and metal parts to attach to the front. You have to (I think) carefully twist the vertical metal slats so they face forward. Sometimes I look at a kit and I think ""Oh, those are the parts I'm going to break."" Well, there they are. Also the very fine top-of-the-turret grab irons. I've broken them on every other FL-10 turret I've built, and here's another one. :P (They aren't included with the 13/75 or there would be another two.)

Overall, looking at just the parts? These are nice kits and I'm looking forward to building them. I'm still going to take a look at Tamiya's when it ships-- I'm guessing it won't include a lot of PE, but you never know. It's pretty great that instead of having to settle for an old and incredibly shitty kit, we now have multiple choices for models of this weird little tank! (I wouldn't be surprised if Hobby Boss doesn't ship one sooner or later too, since they've already done the work for the turret.)

EDIT: Never mind, I found turret grab irons in the other kit, so now I can have broken 4 of them.

Also, Takom made the little flip-up sight things for the commander and gunner out of plastic, where HB used photoetch (and I've dropped and lost one). Heller made of them out of plastic, over-scale and ugly, but Takom's look pretty nice and about the right size (and not flat like HB's).",2016-02-09 19:17:31+00:00,cztrqyh,1.0,t3_44y9jg,1061.0,modelmakers

The other thing is that that looks like a dust mask (like, for people who sand a lot of drywall spackle or for plaster dust). If you're spraying acrylic that's probably fine. If you're spraying something solvent-based and you don't have very good ventilation, it won't necessarily help since solvent fumes will pass right through it. (If you can smell paint thinner inside your mask, it's not working.) You said you had the window open when you sprayed, which is good, but best (if you can drop 30 bucks on a fancy mask) would be an actual respirator with organic vapor filters.

If you're just spraying occasionally in a room with good ventilation it's probably not that big a deal, but if you want to paint in the winter with the windows closed it's a good idea to get something better than a particulate filter...

Go VERY light on the trigger. If you don't have a double-action trigger it'll be a little tougher to do nice blending, but it's possible. 

Lighten the base color with a lighter version of the same color, not white-- if you use white it'll just look sort of weird and washed-out. If you use something with a different tint it can come out kind of weird too. The shade I used for lightening this thing was pretty different from the base color:

http://i.imgur.com/IwinrpT.jpg

...so it's not ideal. Is this the kind of thing you're seeing? 

If you're trying to do specular shading (like the sun hitting the vehicle), think of your airbrush as the sun and spray (lightly) from the direction the sun would be shining. 

Usually when I have stuff go wrong, though, it's because I've sprayed it too much with the modulating color. Sometimes I'll go back over it with the original base color. You can also then give the whole thing a wash of some sort (or a filter, really) to tie all the colors together tonally. ",2016-02-05 17:52:18+00:00,czp1iaw,2.0,t1_czowz7v,6510.0,modelmakers

1334,"A gloss coat is clear lacquer or varnish-- it gives the decals a nice smooth surface to sit on. If you put a decal on a dull or matte surface, there will be little bits of air trapped under it and it'll give the whole thing a sort of silvery look-- that's ""silvering"". If you look at the area around the printed parts of the decals on some models posted on this sub you'll see it-- it's non-obvious that this is something to worry about until you have a weird-looking decal on your model. :/ 

Usually I paint a little Future on where the decal will go, put the decal on (usually followed by setting solution), and then when the decal is dry and looks good I clearcoat over the whole model to seal in the decals. If you do this right you can make the clear border around the decal entirely vanish. 

The other thing a gloss coat does is give washes a smooth surface to slide along so they'll suck down into crevices and details rather than sitting right where you apply them. If you apply a wash on a matte surface it will stick to the paint where you put it rather than following the call of surface tension and capillary action and sucking up to details or sliding along panel lines or whatever. 

Ultimately, since I mostly do armor and I don't want it to be shiny, use a series of paint and clear layers to build up whatever it is I want my tanks to look like-- so it's something like primer -&gt; base coat -&gt; detail painting -&gt; gloss -&gt; decals -&gt; gloss -&gt; weathering/washes -&gt; dullcoat. 

I think there are only one or two premade airbrush booths out there. The one I usually see (at micro-mark and so on) isn't 2.5 feet wide, but it can be hooked together in multiples so you can get more width.

I built my own out of 2x2 lumber and plastic sheeting, but the fan I used was way too small. Currently I'm planning to replace it with a furnace filter and a giant window box fan. The total cost ends up being pretty low but it was kind of a pain to get together. The important parts are airflow and filtering (if you don't have an external exhaust pipe of some sort...). The rule of thumb I've seen is 100cfm airflow... I was using a PC case fan, but it was pretty tiny and didn't pull enough air to make much difference. 

Either way, you should probably pick up a respirator so you can avoid coughing up paint boogers and having terrible lung problems. Even a little blowback means solvents and junk up your nose...

Being a completist-- gotta build one of every major Soviet Cold War tank. I've got a nice T-55A and a T-72, so I ""need"" a T-62, T-64, T-80, and if I feel fancy a T-90. And a couple of variants of each if I feel especially enthusiastic (I have a T-62AM upgrade kit, which is why there are 2 T-62s in there). 

Attempting, over time, to build the vehicles I especially liked climbing around on when I was a tank museum tour guide. That's why I have the giant 2S7 Pion, the SCUD, the ZSU-23-4 Shilka, the EBR kits, and the M60A2 (which I think I will replace with the upcoming better M60A2 kit that's coming out and is more accurate and doesn't have a bore evacuator on the gun) and the White scout car and some others. 

Maschinen Krieger kits are being reissued right now-- historically they've been made briefly and then gone out of production quickly, with big gaps in between during which the kits get SUPER EXPENSIVE because they're fairly rare. So since they're not terribly expensive (under US$20 for the current Wave SAFS kits) I've been getting extras. I'll build them or I'll trade them to people later. Or if nothing else, they go together pretty quickly and are fun to paint. Lots of good weathering possibilities there. 

Some of the other stuff is just because I think it's neat, and kits come into and go out of production unpredictably-- so when will I get to get another good AMX 30 kit? Who knows? I don't know how Meng works yet, so I picked up their BMP-T and AMX30 kits when I had a chance. And Tiger Model are new and are doing high-quality kits of interesting and non-mainstream subjects (the AMX 10RCR I built a couple of months ago and a VBL) so I want to support them. The big dumb Renwal Tera Cruiser kit I picked up because it was really really cheap-- under $20 for a huge box of plastic for another unusual subject. 

So there you go. Now it's 4 or 5 years after starting this mess and I have a stupidly huge pile of kits in my garage. I'll build some of them, I'll swap or sell some of them probably, and when my kids get old enough we can build some kits together. 

I've mostly stopped buying more kits, these days-- new stuff like Takom's AMX 13s, yeah. I've been waiting for those. But otherwise unless something is really cheap or really interesting I let it go by. I have plenty to do for quite a while. 8)

http://www.homedepot.com/p/Signature-Development-72-in-Fold-Out-Wood-Workbench-WKBNCH72X22/203083493

I have one of those, but I took a piece of laminate countertop 6 feet long and bolted it to the top of the wooden bench with 1/2"" carriage bolts. It's more or less this:

http://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-72-in-Tempo-Laminate-Countertop-in-Tumbled-Roca-483538T6/202060861

...except I got my countertop at a huge discount because laminate is pretty fragile if it's not attached to anything, and the local Home Depot had a piece where the front edges were busted up, so I got it for less than half price. A little quality time with the router and I buzzed the busted edge off and now it looks quite nice:

I found 2-foot by 4-foot cutting mats at uscutter.com: http://www.uscutter.com/Self-Healing-Cutting-Mat

(...and bigger if you have a bigger table...) 

I probably didn't need that, though, but it's nice since I can remove it if it gets too beat up, and it means the laminate will last longer. 

The paintbrush holders are cast concrete because I am a brutalism nerd. They are startlingly heavy. The chair I found by the side of the road and fixed up. It has a lovely giant spring that squeaks when I lean back. 

Anyway, there you go-- 3 or 4 years worth of figuring out what works for me... 

The one you linked to would probably work pretty well. The lighting looks handy, and the pegboard is good for hanging up stuff you need easily at hand and sprues you're using when you need to clear table space. If I didn't have a garage and tools and the ability to bolt giant countertops to things, I would probably be using something very similar to the one you're looking at.

I wish I read Japanese enough to know what this guy in his melted-looking robes was supposed to be. He's pretty cool, anyway.

The kit fit together pretty well, with a little cleanup. Only one resin bubble was visible, in the left hand thumb. There were pretty big gaps between the arms and the torso, so I mixed up some Apoxie Sculpt and squooshed it between the parts to hold it on. I used toothpicks and a sort of rubber-tipped sculpting tool to clean up the joints. You can see the white Apoxie putty in there. I think it should hold the parts on better than CA would-- we'll see, I suppose. The rest was glued with good old-fashioned thick CA gel. 

I think I'm going to prime in black and then give it a light spray of the burnt aluminum color of Vallejo's airbrush metallic paints, and some detail painting on the gun.

If you don't want to buy like 20 bottles of paint for your first kit, see if there are alternate paint schemes (like, if there's a really complex scheme that's described in the instructions vs. a simpler scheme you can find photos of on the internet) and paint those. Or just skip it entirely if it's, say, a tiny little detail on the underside and it's the only thing that's a particular color. 

You can also look for paint sets from Vallejo or Testors or whoever-- sometimes you can get a complete selection of paint for a particular sort of model all at once for cheaper than it would be if you bought a bunch of individual bottles.

1412,"Yeah, FF and I are in pretty much the same boat, although my kids are older now.

Yeah, if you have kids you'll have probably six months of either watching them (we called it ""toddler suicide watch"") or being too tired to do anything. As they get older, it gets better. I started building models at about a year or so into fatherhood because I needed something I could do when everyone else was asleep that was mentally involving, wasn't loud and was pretty calm and relaxing. As they've gotten older I've had more time for it and I've gotten more into it.

One thing that helps with time is swapping kid time and time away from kids with the mother of your baby. If neither of you do anything but watch the kid you will both go insane and/or experience post-partum depression. (PPD is rough and there isn't always a specific cause, so don't assume that just because you're giving her time off she's not experiencing it. Communicate, etc.) I used to take our first kid out to random stores (electronics store, just going grocery shopping or whatever) and give my wife time to sit at home quietly and drink coffee and basically not worry about the baby for a while. I got some kid bonding time and got to run around out of the house, and in exchange she'd take him places or even just let me lock myself in the workroom for a while so I could have time to work on stuff I've wanted to work on.

So yeah, with kids, don't expect full-time weekend builds, just like you wouldn't expect to be able to binge-watch Breaking Bad or whatever with a toddler in the room (unless you want them to learn some exciting new words). But it works out. Don't fear! But also don't make any plans for a few months after baby time... 8)

You can see how he built the tracks separately, in little bits that curve around the drive sprocket and idler, painted them separately from the hull and wheels, and then attached them all at the end.

I'd paint figures as separately as possible-- put them on or in the tank as close to the end as possible. If you have a commander who's only half there, put in the little shelf he'll sit on (or whatever is inside the turret instead of his legs), make sure it lines up right, and then paint him seprately and attach him later. And that driver is probably just the top of his head, right? It might be touchy if he has enough shoulders that it's hard to get him through the hatch, but see if you can paint him separately too. (I'm assuming that what's on the box is what's inside the box, so if the figures are different disregard anything that doesn't make sense...) 

For example, here's my Tiny Frenchman: 

http://i.imgur.com/TLg6mT6.jpg

...mounted on a plastic stick that I cut and sanded to the right length so he'd be just poking his head and shoulders out of the driver's hatch:

I looked at photos and adjusted it a bunch to make sure he was sitting up enough before I glued him in (and he was the last thing to go in, after everything else I did to the model).

1424,"Yeah, what /u/nicely11b said-- leave the road wheels and tracks separate and paint them before attaching them. I usually glue all the tools and junk onto the hull before painting it, though, mostly because otherwise I will lose them or something, and gluing onto a painted surface means I'd have to either mask the place where the parts attach or scrape off paint to glue them on, and either of those means fiddly paint touch-up anyway. So I glue everything on, prime, paint, and then paint the details in place. 

And also definitely don't attach the wheels and tracks until last, so you can paint the backs of the wheels and the parts of the hull that will be blocked by the wheels. You'll have to mask the ends of the axles, which you can do with fancy liquid mask or just pieces of tape wrapped around them. (I've gotten lazy and these days I just paint them and scrape off enough paint that the cement will work when I stick the wheels on, but masking is a better idea.)

What kind of tracks does it have? Individual links or rubber bands or something? 

I wouldn't do a lot of metal stuff right off, but I thoroughly recommend getting metal barrels. This guy on eBay usually has good quality, inexpensive barrels and tracks and stuff (and he throws in bonus pieces like antennas and things when you order): http://stores.ebay.com/AchtungPanzer-SHOP

Here, 10 bucks including shipping for a complete set of 38(t) barrels: http://www.ebay.com/itm/1-35-RB-MODEL-BARRELS-SET-3-pcs-GERMAN-PANZER-38-t-/141885517298?hash=item2109092df2

Stuff usually takes about 2 weeks to get from Poland to the US. I don't know where you are, but it would certainly be faster in Europe.

A good cutting mat is a start. You can get giant ones here for MUCH less than art store cutting mats: 

http://www.uscutter.com/Self-Healing-Cutting-Mat

Nail polish racks for paint (check Amazon). Maybe little drawer units (from Ikea-- they have some nice ones that aren't too expensive and have lots of little metal drawers). 

If you need an actual work surface, either find a desk at Ikea (or somewhere-- I like Ikea, heh) or look at Home Depot. Mine is a sort of folding workbench from Home Depot (about 75 bucks) with a salvaged piece of composite countertop bolted to the top (30 bucks from Home Depot-- composite countertops are kind of fragile and people mishandle them, so I found one that was pretty beat up around the edges and asked if they'd sell it to me at a discount. 7 feet of countertop for 30 bucks. 8). 

Here's what it ends up looking like:

I only set that up the other day, so it'll probably evolve a bit as I build stuff on it. 

Also, I scrounge whatever I can, or buy non model-building-specific versions of things. There's a markup on tools, I think, when they're listed as for model building, but you don't need a Testors brand sprue cutter when a Home Depot or Harbor Freight flush cutter will work as well and cost less... Same with paint brushes-- there are some nice model-specific ones, but shop art stores for sales (or poke around Amazon)... I use bottlecaps for mixing paint or holding little bits of glue, and cheap plastic boxes from Ikea for storing stuff... That kind of thing.

http://www.cybermodeler.com/tips/thinner.shtml

The acrylic retarder and stuff is nice but not really a big deal if you're not airbrushing. It's to keep the droplets from drying before they hit the model.

It may work better, but I'm not sure-- I was happy with drops of water (even just tap water) when I was painting with Tamiya... 

I think you can get smaller bottles of brush-on primer, but at that point it's only about half the price and you might as well buy the spraycan anyway, since it'll work better than brush-painting your primer.",2016-01-06 21:23:31+00:00,cyoinqz,13.0,t1_cyoh63f,1935.0,modelmakers
1560,"For acrylic you can use water as a thinner, or windex if you really want (some people use it to thin paint for airbrushing). For enamel you need turpenoid or paint thinner. Odorless turpenoid from an art store is good because it's not stinky, but you could use turpentine or whatever. 

I'm not sure basic enamel will work as a primer-- is it a fairly matte finish? I like Tamiya's spraycan primer-- it's very fine-grained matte paint and sticks to all kinds of stuff. 

Have you bought any paint yet at all? If not, get a spraycan of Tamiya primer, and use all acrylic for everything else. It's easy to clean up and won't give you headaches if you don't have good ventilation, and you'll know nothing's going to eat anything else and you can mix everything with everything else... Thin with water, clean your brushes and stuff with water, keep it simple.

You can pre-shade with black acrylic if you want since once it's dry acrylic won't eat acrylic. (Once it's dry it'll take ammonia to eat dried acrylic.)

You can paint acrylic over enamel or enamel over acrylic, but you can't mix them. Also, don't mix Vallejo and Tamiya acrylic, since they're slightly different and they'll turn into jello. (The alcohol in the Tamiya paint will gel the Vallejo. It's pretty nasty.) 

Painting enamel over enamel can be touchy, too, since the solvent in the top layer will soften a dried bottom layer. I'd recommend against it unless you put an acrylic clearcoat between them.",2016-01-06 17:58:58+00:00,cyo9h07,7.0,t1_cyo3utf,7737.0,modelmakers
1566,"Oh yeah, if you're going to roll it around, don't paint the tracks at all. 8) And if you want to do shading, get an airbrush... You CAN do it with brush painting, but it'll require some careful mixing and very delicate brushwork and it's very hard to make it look good. 

Contrasting colors getting tied together into a more complementary color scheme is done with filters and weathering-- maybe pigments, maybe an oil paint dot filter, but something to give the whole model a sort of overall tint. This has the effect of bringing everything sort of closer together, so it looks like they're related, if that makes sense. That can be pretty advanced, so maybe don't worry about it right off... 

Pre-shading can be iffy. On my tutorial thing (as somebody else pointed out) I preshade really dark and then wipe it out with a heavy base coat-- it takes a light hand on the airbrush. You don't _need_ to preshade, either, if you're going to do pin washes or oil paint washes or whatever. 

There are so many ways to do all this shading stuff, and they all end up looking slightly different but can all look really good. Mostly, figure out what works for you and do it. 

I would avoid fancy finishing stuff like bullet holes (probably with a hot wire?) or mud for now, and I've never done the texture thing at all. That's pretty advanced and mostly requires some hard-to-find or unpleasant materials like Mr Surfacer or putty thinned with acetone. I wouldn't bother with that on a first model. 

Don't get bogged down in advanced techniques quite yet-- get one solid build done and looking good, figure out what you've learned from that and what you'd do differently next time, and go from there. I try to do one new thing on every model, and build up skills that way. Maybe you aren't as easily discouraged, though-- it's up to you, of course. 8)",2016-01-05 22:17:39+00:00,cynawqv,5.0,t1_cyn8zoc,2639.0,modelmakers
1567,"
10ml should last a while. Those little 17ml bottles Vallejo Model Air comes in last pretty long if I'm not doing anything ridiculous like painting a 1/35 scale Leopold. I don't thin it or anything, either. 10ml should be enough for a couple of models as long as you're not spraying really heavy thick coats. 

For the shading, I usually take, say, the base Russian Green (and yeah, it doesn't matter with that as long as you're pretty close-- exact color matches and whether you should worry about it or not is a pretty big topic though) and a little light green. The ratio shouldn't matter _too_ much-- I usually eyeball it, put a little of the base color straight into the airbrush cup and then drip in a few drops of the lighter color and stir it with a toothpick until it looks lighter. I usually don't worry about thorough mixing-- I'm trying to modulate the color, so a little color variation is fine, if not desirable. 

I spray a piece of cardboard until it comes out how I want (so I can make sure the mixed paint has gotten through the airbrush to the nozzle) and then start VERY lightly layering it over the base coat, starting in the middle of large hull panels or the outer parts of convex curves. You're simulating both a little bit of wear and sunlight hitting and bleaching the paint, or reflecting back a bit. It's going to get a little arty here, and it can look more or less stylized depending on how light you make the highlight color and how heavily you spray it. I usually either lay it on heavier than I should or don't spray it enough and end up with it being not very visible (like that Panzer II from the build log I keep linking you to, which is so lightly shaded it's pretty much invisible in anything but full sunlight). 

I forget what kind of airbrush you have, but this is where it's good to have a double-action trigger and a light touch. 

Try not to get intimidated by shading-- it's actually pretty easy if you have a steady hand and don't go to town on the paint. Seriously, if I can pull it off, anyone can. 8) 

Painting without primer is a crap shoot. You might be fine or the paint might fall off when you touch it. It's probably better to hit it with a layer of something like Tamiya's spraycan primer... That'll also highlight any gaps or rough spots you need to fill or sand-- it's a good step toward finishing, anyway. 

Track painting is a pretty big subject potentially too. The rubber tracks that come with old Tamiya kits may not actually hold paint at all, even with primer. They will probably be the most frustrating thing of all. Especially since if you stretch or twist them as you put them on, since Tamiya primer is kind of rigid and will flake off. I think if you're going to use the kit tracks, I'd suggest painting them black with Tamiya paint (which dries flexible) and just being really careful with them. Be prepared to repaint pieces and then not touch them again if you can help it. Then maybe drybrush a little dull steel color over the raised parts and give them a wash of a dark rust to get gunk into the gaps. There are some decent writeups on the wiki and I think it's been asked enough that you can find it with the search function...

1615,"Build the hull, leave the wheels separate. Paint the wheels and the underside of the hull (so you can paint behind the wheels easily, right?) and the rubber rims on the wheels, and then hook 'em on. Old Tamiya probably has little poly caps that go inside the wheels so they'll just push onto the axles (but be careful not to push too hard and break anything). 

I wouldn't use superglue for a plastic model-- plastic model cement is MUCH easier to deal with than superglue (since superglue will stick to fingers and everything, while plastic cement will mostly only stick to plastic). 

If you're going to keep building models, having a couple of spare colors that aren't used a _lot_ is probably a good idea. You might only use gunmetal once on that DshK machine gun, but everything will have a machine gun of some sort, or some pieces that need gunmetal, right? Paint keeps for a long time (as long as you keep the bottle closed). 

Airbrushing is a good idea for a base coat, at least-- brushpainting large areas is tricky. It's hard to get a smooth base coat. But maybe practice airbrushing on a piece of cardboard or a plastic spoon or something before spraying your model, so you have some idea what to expect.

1635,"Painting rubber tracks is always a pain. It really depends on who made the track, but older vinyl tracks can be a real pain to paint. If you have really old vinyl tracks (old Tamiya kits, for example), don't paint them. Either resign yourself to very minimally painted or unpainted tracks, or throw them away and get aftermarket tracks instead.

If you're going to prime them, don't use a rigid primer like Tamiya-- use a flexible primer like Vallejo. Once you get them primed, don't flex them much-- the paint will flake off. 

If I'm using flexy tracks, I tend to go pretty minimal-- paint them black with nice flexible Vallejo acrylic, then give them a heavy wash of some rusty color to give the base black, and drybrush on light metallic highlights to make the track look worn. 

I think that's more or less what I did here:

I'm pretty sure on this thing I didn't paint the tracks at all, which probably isn't ideal, but there you go.

Usually you do weathering stuff after the glosscoat and before the dullcoat. That way the dullcoat seals it in. So yes, that's when washes and stuff would go on. Usually washes are mixed at a 1:10 ratio of paint to thinner-- for Tamiya you could even use water, although Tamiya thinner would probably be better since I think it evaporates more quickly. Acrylic washes go on a little easier if you dampen the area beforehand, too-- not so you can see standing water drops, but just a little bit of water to make it just slightly wet.

Everything will fit well and the instructions will be good. You'll have something to make mistakes on and not feel like you've wasted money if you have problems. Their M-41 Walker Bulldog is also a popular beginner kit. 

Some older Tamiya and Trumpeter kits CAN be made so they'll move, but they don't come with the parts any more. The wheels have little soft plastic pieces so they turn, and some people here have built those kits so they can drive them around. It's more difficult since they don't come with the motors and gearboxes any more. 

I'd go for the T-62, since I really like Cold War Soviet tanks.

If you're using enamels (or paint-thinner-based paint) then painting over even a dried layer can soften and potentially damage the first layer, so you'd lay down something impervious to paint thinner between them. That's why they recommend acrylic.

As long as you aren't thinning your acrylic with Windex or something with ammonia in it, you should be pretty safe with acrylics. (That's one of the advantages of acrylic over enamels...)

(Similarly, if you're doing oils over enamel, the oil paint thinner will eat the enamel, and you'd want to put a layer down to seal in oils before painting over them with anything since they tend to be a little more fragile.)",2015-12-05 00:24:26+00:00,cxnkd4o,2.0,t1_cxni86w,3860.0,modelmakers

As for glue, CA (superglue) will work but can be hard to work with sometimes. For starting out, I'd suggest something like Testor's Model Master cement, which comes in a sort of funny-shaped bottle with a long thin applicator. You should probably squirt glue into a little dish or a bottlecap or something and apply it with a toothpick rather than straight from the bottle though. You could also use something like Tamiya Extra Thin cement, which is also easy to use but can melt your model if you use too much... 

I would build it with the wheels and tracks and turret off, paint each subassembly separately (so you can get in behind the wheels with paint, and places that would be hard to get on the turret and so on) and then assemble the painted pieces into a final model. 

This is probably the wrong place to ask if you should get into building models. I don't see a lot of people posting about how much they regret it... 8)

But recently it seems like they realized that they could do R&amp;D more rapidly if they got each piece of research to pay for itself. So they miniaturized the MS20 filter and released a very simple cheap pocket toy, the original Monotron. This did well enough to encourage them to continue with little pocket stuff, while taking the pieces and circuit design and miniaturization techniques they'd developed and rolling them back up into larger and more expensive instruments, for which the design work and troubleshooting has already been done. And if the pieces along the way didn't do too well? Not as big a deal, since they were cheap to produce, and a modernized, mass-produceable MS20 filter is going to be useful for a lot of things. That gets us the Volca Bass and so on, and eventually the MS20 Mini. It's pretty clever if you look at it that way, with the little pieces feeding into the larger stuff. 

(And yeah, the cheap stuff is limited, but then, it's cheap stuff. You're funding their R&amp;D and getting toys. If you want toys, you're happy. If you want more hardcore gear, wait a year or so and there you go.)

At any time, any number of groups might need access-- US park rangers, local police, local fire, local ambulances, CalFire, and so on. But people are fallible and there's always that one jerk who loses the key.

When that jerk loses the key, you could mail out new keys to the 8 other organizations who need keys, but that leaves potentially lengthy periods of time when the gates are locked and un-unlockable. That could be a pretty big problem during fire season in California, or if there's an accident and they need to get emergency services up the hill there. Better to let each organization pick a lock and deal with keys themselves. Ambulances have a key; fire has a key; US Park Service rangers have a key; the guy who services the microwave relay up to has a key. If one of them loses it, rekeying requires a bolt cutter or a grinder, rather than days of the USPS.

Looks pretty nice! The painting is pretty decent. It looks like you ran into the same dumb poor fit on the upper and lower hull everyone has, though-- it was made to be opened and closed so you could change the batteries-- that's why there's that clip thing under the turret. That meant, though, that they didn't worry too much about there being a gap right in front and right in back. I think I had to clamp and putty mine when I built it... 

It also looks like you put the decals on over a matte surface-- you can see the decal carrier film around the actual colored parts. You can get around that by glosscoating first, putting on decals, and either glosscoating, weathering, and dullcoating, or just dullcoating over the decals to seal them in. You might be able to hit them with some Micro Sol to melt them into place, too. As it is, they might come off if you touch them, so be careful.

It looks pretty good for a first, brushpainted, kit. You might look at a circle template for painting wheels (even brushpainting, just to keep things tidier-- just put ""circle template"" into Amazon and see what shows up. They're not expensive at all.). It makes painting wheels and tires different colors MUCH easier...

1824,"Okay, I will now argue (slightly) with the previous response. You don't HAVE to leave everything separate and paint it separately, and sometimes it's not really a good idea (gluing stuff on after it's painted can also be tricky). But yeah, for big stuff, where you'd have to paint under it (wheels on tanks, drop tanks on planes that kind of stuff), yes, you're probably better off leaving it separate for as long as possible.

You can mask things that are hooked on (get Tamiya tape or a similar firm-but-not-too-sticky masking tape so you don't damage the paint), or you can paint the whole thing and then brush-paint details, which is what I usually do. 

Don't try to pull stuff off if you can help it-- the glue is actually a solvent that melts and welds parts together. You'll just damage stuff if you try to separate the parts.

When I got to college and had jobs, friends and I would haunt local music stores and scam our way into weird busted-up used synthesizers. My second was a Korg Poly-800, followed by a Yamaha DX27 (mostly used for awful grinding noises), a VERY broken but awesome Arp Pro Soloist, um... I've owned and sold an E-Mu Emax HD, a Wavestation EX, an Ensoniq VFX and Mirage, Emulator II, Roland Juno 1, Juno-106, MC202, TR606, TR707, MKS-30, Korg Prophecy, an A-Station, a Roland MKS-10, um, some other Roland digital ROMpler thing, a couple of other samplers, and I don't even remember them all. Come and go, swap around, trade with friends, make some noise, record some stuff, sell them on, it was fun! I'd scrounge around the lower end of the market and see what wasn't cool and buy it. I lived near Boston and the Daddy's Junky Music across the street from Berklee had, for a while, a bargain basement of mostly crap but occasion treasures (although probably beat-to-heck stuff). 

Then there was a sort of unpleasant and mostly music-playing-less time, and now I'm getting back into it. I'm kind of sneaking back up on it, although I think I've gained momentum and may be putting stuff together again. I scored a free SY-85, I kept my old CZ101, somebody gave me a Triton Rack(!!! A friend indeed!), and I just got this JX-8P... It's been a while, and honestly I was never _that_ good at it, but I've written some catchy stuff and could at least lay down an old-school Berlin-style groove without too much trouble. I lean toward hardware more than software-- for whatever reason I can't get into software like I can hardware. It's probably a generational thing... Now, who knows? Maybe I'll get this going. Maybe I'll get my kids into it. (I hope so.)

I have a couple of things kicking around-- an old Wavestation, a Roland D-10, a Yamaha SY-85 I picked up for free and repaired, a Casio CZ-101 (my first synthesizer, although this is the third one I've owned). I have an old Effectron II reverb/delay unit, which is cool but not quite as long-term useful as a multifx box with memory would be. So I decided to hit Starving Musician and see what they had in their rack.

I didn't actually make it to their FX rack-- I headed back to look at keyboards first and spotted this big ol' slab of 80's analog front and center, and marked for WAY less than I thought it should be, with a case, but with the dreaded warning ""AS IS."" So I checked the usual stuff-- keys, buttons, display, polyphony (in case one of the voices was dead), it all seemed fine to me. So I asked-- the aftertouch is bad, and it's REALLY tedious and fiddly to clean up, so they didn't. They just marked it down and put it up for sale. So I bought it-- $250 for a pretty nice (if slightly filthy) JX-8P, flight case(!), and an M-16C cartridge in the case! Those things alone are worth like 60 bucks! 

This seems like a good omen for getting back into it-- now I just need to find a good cheap FX unit...

The funny thing is, there was just a drop of Vallejo paint in the bottlecap I was (rather foolishly) reusing to mix the transparent blue and black Tamiya acrylic, and it was turning into sticky gel as I painted. It worked out in the end, but I probably should have ditched the whole batch and started over. 

For those I primed, then painted the periscopes with little dabs of Maskol. After painting the camo, I removed the maskol so the white primer was revealed. This mostly worked, although it took off a little too much paint in a couple of places and I had to repaint around a couple of the periscope edges. Next time I think I'd use less Maskol. You can see those spots if you look really closely on a couple of them, and around the headlights (which is the first time EVER that I remembered to paint the insides silver before attaching the clear lenses, so there's at at least. 8).

But if you pick up a cheap model (for modern-ish armor, maybe Tamiya's M41 Walker Bulldog) and mess it up along the way, your SECOND build will be MUCH better and you can make that one the one that counts, if you see what I mean. 8)

You don't need an airbrush for weathering-- mostly I use airbrushes for base coats and some shading and stuff, and then do detail painting and weathering with brushes. There are easy techniques and complex techniques, expensive supplies and cheap supplies, and honestly, you don't need to spend a lot of cash on fancy paint or whatever to get good results. There are TONS of things to buy, but in the end if you have a good knife and a couple of decent brushes and you take your time with it you'll do fine.

Get a tub of Burnt Umber, a tube of caucasian flesh tone, a tube of black and a tube of white (or fewer, in that order of importance) and a can of odorless turpenoid (so it's not stinky) and you're set. Heck, even a single tube of burnt or raw umber will revolutionize your rust streaking... 

You do need to be careful of what you're painting over, though-- turpenoid and mineral spirits will eat enamels, but won't touch acrylics, so if you're using enamels you'll need to clearcoat over it with an acrylic varnish (like Future) before doing an oil wash...

1920,"Yeah, that sounds like a good way to treat the tracks-- I'd be interested in seeing how it comes out. Vallejo's newish airbrush metallic paints work really nicely, if you don't already have something picked out. 

What I usually do with rubber tires is paint the wheel (or at least the outside edges) with a sort of dark grey color-- rubber isn't solid black, it's a very dark grey with lighter depths where dirt and dust builds up, kind of the opposite of most things (which are light with darker shadows). For that kind of tire, I think painting them all grey would be a good start, and then maybe a darker grey around the contact surfaces (where the dust would be knocked off as the wheels turn). 

For the wheels, try to find a circle template with a circle the size of the wheels and use that as a mask to cover up the tires while you paint the wheels. (This is assuming an airbrush-- if you're brushpainting, just have a steady hand...) I would paint the wheels the same color as the base coat of the hull. For your example there, it looks like the base coat is a sort of light yellow, like a washed out panzer dunkelgelb, with the camo pattern sprayed roughly over it. The lower hull probably started out dunkelgelb but got dirty driving around-- you could paint it a darker version of dunkelgelb (since it wouldn't be sunbleached like the upper surfaces) and then give it (and the wheels) a heavy wash of some kind of dirt color, like a darker yellow or brown, and maybe a little lighter dust-like wash.

It's pretty similar, though-- aside from the gill armor (rather than rubber skirts-- that makes it quite unusual, as I think only 20 or so were made with gill armor) most of the differences are internal and not obvious at all, which was kind of a surprise when US intelligence people got their hands on a non-export-version of the T-72 for the first time and realized that all their research had been on the _export_ versions originally, and that the Soviets were hanging onto their highest-quality equipment and selling stripped-down versions to their allies...

1925,"Lightening with white will just make it look washed out-- you want to keep the warmth of the color, so lighten it with something that complements the dark green. I like to use a few drops of Vallejo's light green (since I'm mostly using Vallejo colors these days), but any lighter green will work. I'm not sure NATO green will work, but it might, if it's lighter than your Russian green there. Mix a couple of drops of it with your dark green and see how it looks. 

When you're happy with the color, spray it VERY lightly, building up the lighter color at the center of panels or along the outer curves of, for example, the turret-- think of the airbrush as the sun, beating down and lightening the parts that are most often in full sunlight. 

I used a weird shade to do the shading on this:

http://imgur.com/a/CQBXm

...but it means you can see where I sprayed it. (I kind of like it, even though it looks really unnatural. The original color was quite dark, and I used a too-yellow version of green to lighten it.)

Just start spraying very lightly and layer it on until it looks good to you-- don't worry about getting too exaggerated. If you spray it too much and it gets weird, you can tone it down with filters later.

Your T-72 is a nice clean build. A little shading will make it look really great, and suddenly it'll look less toylike and more like a real object. I love T-72s. They're my favorite Cold War-ear tank... Here's some photoreference for a T-72M, if you're interested:

It's not ugly, though-- utilitarian, and from a time when people trusted government and liked their government buildings firm and solid, like their governments. It's a different paradigm-- before post-modernism got all playful and stuff, and people like Michael Graves starting making buildings that looked like toys, like they were rendered at a lower resolution and scaled up, or drawn in low-poly-count CAD. Big blocks of color, simple shapes and lines, and all to get away from wide-and-flat... And it's fun, but it gets exhausting after a while, being fun and playful and stuff all the time. Give me a solid block of white and some careful geometric curves, give me a rooftop garden and maybe some piloti and a place to walk and sit in the afternoon, sheltered beneath uncountable tons of concrete-- I can be happy there, in a place built and designed by men and women who knew the value of solid shapes and uncompromising volumes and who weren't afraid to design buildings on a greater scale than simple humans.

To get the decals to snug down into the zimmerit on the Tiger, you could douse them with Micro Sol, let them sit for a couple of minutes, and then VERY gently press them into the ridges with a roll of damp paper towel. (Damp enough that the decal doesn't stick to it.) Let it dry and repeat if necessary. Then clearcoat over the decals to seal them in and protect them.

For brushes, shop art stores-- look for sales. You only need a few, a largish 3 or 5 round for base coats (I'm assuming that apartment life means no air compressor, too-- you could go airbrush plus CO2, though, which is silent) and a 5/0 and 20/0 for detail painting. Pick a kit, figure out what colors you need, pick up some acrylic paints (since the fumes won't give you brain damage or stink you out if you can't open the window-- Vallejo Model Color are quite nice to paint with, or Tamiya if you can't find Vallejo), maybe a rattlecan of white Tamiya primer (which might be problematic without ventilation, but think about it). 

Glue -- go for either extra-thin cement (Tamiya Extra Thin, Bondene, Tenax 7R, and prepare to dedicate a natural-bristle brush to it) or the kind of thin gel that comes in a funny-shaped bottle like Model Master cement. Shouldn't be more than ten bucks for enough to last you a few kits. 

Kit: Start with something you like but won't feel bad about if you mess it up, since, honestly, you probably will. Tamiya kits generally fit together very nicely and should build up into a decent vehicle without too much pain. Watch out for weird Eastern European kits since they will often require a ton of work to get them to fit nicely. You didn't mention if you like armor or aircraft or cars or whatever, but Tamiya's under-$20 tank kits are older but pretty decent.

The one thing I'd point out is that the decals are silvering a bit-- it looks to me like you put them on over the matte base coat without any gloss between them and the paint. That traps little pockets of air under them and makes the edges stand out-- you can get around that by putting down a little gloss, putting on the decals (and then using any decal setting solution, Micro Sol/Micro Set, or even just white vinegar) and then doing another clearcoat over them. (Usually a gloss coat, followed by weathering and a dullcoat to seal it all in.) 

So yeah-- the tools look really nice (I always think they're a pain to get painted nicely), and the wheels and tracks are surprisingly good for how cruddy those rubber tracks are. You should definitely try another tank. 8)

* Soviet T-62 in Afghanistan decal set (8 bucks) ( http://star-decals.net/star35883.html )

I usually glue everything down, although that makes painting things like that type of wheel difficult.

And it's a tiny little contact point so it's probably pretty delicate at the best of times.

You should be able to take very tiny amounts of super-thin CA glue and a glue applicator of some sort (the little fork kind, like a needle with the tip of the loop cut off) and get tiny amounts of glue into the gap, just enough to hold it and not show. It won't be super strong, but it'll let you handle it and make it less likely that it'll break if you bump it or something...

Steel photoetch, too stiff to easily bend, with grillwork right next to the bend line, so of course the grille wants to bend MUCH more than the metal. Even with a bending tool and razor blade, the damn thing wouldn't bend on the line but insisted on bending one row into the grill. So it looks kind of iffy now, and might end up okay. I guess when I get around to painting it I'll have to throw a bunch of rust and crap on there so it looks dented and not just poorly folded.

There are some other parts which didn't fit very well either, and I don't know if that's because I hooked some stuff on in the wrong place or if it's supposed to touch or what because the directions aren't very clear...

Practice test-fitting before gluing. Get some tiny little pliers or tweezers to hold the parts that are too small for fingers. And you don't have to paint stuff before it's on the model-- in fact mostly don't if you can help it. I build everything before painting anything... 

Pick up some Tamiya primer in spraycans-- that may help with the runny paint problem. Make sure you're using brush painting paint (that is, not Vallejo Model Air or LifeColor acrylic, or other stuff meant for airbrushing). If you need to, paint thin coats, wait for it to dry, add more coats until it's covered. 

Older Airfix kits can be iffy. I don't know the ones you have because I mostly build tanks.

Think of the modulating color (which should be a lighter shade of the base coat) as the sun, decide what direction the sun may be coming from (probably not straight above), and move it around spraying lightly from that direction.

2 will probably give you the best results overall unless you're pretty hot with a paintbrush. If you brushpaint it, thin your paint a little so it goes on smooth and you don't get brush marks. You'll probably need a couple of coats for good coverage, so take your time and let it dry between layers.

If you don't care if the wheels turn, you could try to get some glue into the axle hole to glue the wheel to the axle. If you have extra-thin cement, you could sort of drip some in from a brush, or if you have thicker cement that comes with a long needle-like applicator, you could squeeze some down in between the wheel and axle to glue it into place. If you don't have an applicator you could use a toothpick like a sort of trowel to get some glue in there. 

Even a little off-center, that might at least make it look better, and it would probably only be off-center by a millimeter or two. You could use thick, gap-filling CA glue to fill in the part around there, too, rather than plastic cement, if that's what you have. Or you could cut a little plastic shim from some sprue or something to poke into the gap around the axle. 

If you don't want to do that, you could use a little saw (like a razor saw) to cut the axles behind the wheels, to get the wheels off, and then make new thicker axles or something, in order to hold the wheels steady. That would end up weaker than the original axles, though. I don't think that's what I'd do-- I'd probably just resign myself to non-turning wheels and glue them down tight.

2075,"Okay, I've done quite a lot of armor, and I've avoided aircraft. 8)

You missed a couple of things about armor-- tanks have tracks. Tracks will make or break your model, I think-- there have been a bunch of threads on here pretty much devoted to painting tracks, and I think you could write books just about painting tracks. Plus they either double the parts count (individual links) or cause problems with painting in general (vinyl flexible tracks) or they just are a lot of work in general (metal tracks). 

Details and large flat parts are, I think, similar-- there are ways to make large flat surfaces interesting (various kinds of shading), and most of the armor I've built has stuff that I know I'm going to knock off as I go. Cold-War-era and newer armor especially gets more complex as we add more rangefingers, vents, extra periscopes, anti-aircraft machine guns, wind speed thingies, and so on and so forth. A modern tank could have a ton of random bits stuck on the turret to be broken off while handling it...

Handling kits while painting can be difficult too-- I have started doing most of my detail painting with the model resting on a piece of paper towel-- it cushions it, protects the paint, and when I want to rotate the model, I can rotate the towel and avoid getting fingerprints in the paint.

As far as filling goes, yeah-- aircraft are less forgiving when it comes to filling, especially things like the place where the wing meets the fuselage. That seems to be where I always see putty in people's builds... But armor may also have joints to fill, depending on how the kit is made. That's going to depend on the kit maker.

Overall, I think armor _does_ depend more on weathering to make the model interesting. This is, I think, due to how aircraft and armor are maintained, and what happens to them when they're in duty. Planes go out and come back within a few hours (or tens of hours) and usually receive maintenance between missions. Armor might be out in the field for weeks or months, getting filthy and having bits knocked off and the paint scraped up and so on. That all gives the armor modeler a bunch of interesting stuff to do to a model. (Rust! Chipping! Dust and dirt!) Aircraft, I think, get less of that, if only because they get washed a little more often than your typical tanks (at least if they're not Cold War parade ducks or armor that never gets deployed so the crews pretty much hang around keeping them clean and working on them, like a lot of Cold War West German armor.)

I think if you want black strips, you're going to learn how to mask. And what that might look like is you priming your car, painting a wide black area where you want the black racing stripes, masking where the stripes will be, and then painting your base color over that. When you peel the tape, the stripes will appear.

But painting decals before applying them is going to cause you problems...

I have used a little black (mostly in place of pin washes), and I think if I were doing a tank in green I'd use a couple of different shades of green-- one darker and one lighter-- sparingly dotted around to give the base coat some visual interest.

If you were going to acquire only 3 tubes, though, I'd say white, burnt umber, and black.

2080,"Yup, that's the one thing I'd say about your builds. They're really nice! Just, you know, the decals. Especially those Tamiya decals, which are a little thick, if I recall correctly. You have to put down gloss, put on the decal, maybe Micro-Sol and Micro-Set to melt the decal film a little, and then glosscoat over them to protect them. 

Those are a couple of really nice buids, though-- I've built that T-55A, and it's one of the best kits I've put together. Yours looks pretty nice (even with the extra beat-up metal). Just those decals... You could probably recover from that, too-- if you haven't put any clearcoat over them yet, you could hit them with Micro Sol and Micro Set (or another decal setting liquid or even plain white vinegar) and see if they settle in a little. You might be able to get away with it. 8)

Then if they do, get some kind of dullcoat-- Testor's Dullcote is quite nice-- beware of using hardware store dullcoat varnishes as they can be very hot and eat your paint, although if you're using acrylic you should be pretty safe-- and dullcoat over the whole thing. It'll also help tone down the Rub and Buff stuff and make it look a little more like worn metal and less shiny. 

I really don't have the patience to build the same kit more than once, but if I did, I'd be building another Tamiya T-55A...

If you do a wash over matt, it'll seep in instantly and act as a filter over the whole surface. If you glosscoat first, you can manipulate the wash a little before it dries, and you can carefully apply it to panel lines and things and it'll fill them in through capillary action without you needing to explicitly outline everything you want outlined. If you try this on a matt painted surface, it won't spread out as much and you can't poke it around with a damp brush or clean up the extra before it dries. 

Then, once you have it nicely washed and weathered (if you're weathering-- this is where you'd do chipping and rust if you're going to do that) you can hit the whole thing with a dullcoat and seal it all in. 

A glosscoat can make all your paint look really dark, though, so don't be too surprised if you see that happen. It hasn't damaged the paint-- it's just a weird glosscoat effect. It'll look better after a final dullcoat.

Rather than being totally unhelpful, though, here are quick answers-- enough to get you googling and searching for stuff:

1. Yes. Read answers here. Here is the subreddit wiki build page: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/wiki/buildalongs

2. Vallejo acrylic. They still come in tiny bottles, but you won't need a lot. 

3. Acrylic -&gt; cleans up with water, no death fumes; enamel -&gt; cleans up with paint thinner, crack a window or you'll experience brain damage (or at least get a nasty headache). That's why I go with acrylic.

4. Look airbrushes around $60-80 (a Badger Patriot 105 or an Iwata Neo, I've read) and get a decent little hobby compressor for another $60ish. 

Kits: Older Tamiya armor kits, the ones that are under $20. Their M41 Walker Bulldog and the Panzer II in the build logs I linked to are particularly popular because they're quite inexpensive.

2183,"Also, general airbrush advice:

Clean it good EVERY TIME YOU USE IT. Almost every problem people have with airbrushes can be traced to dried paint in the airbrush somewhere-- blocking airflow, blocking paint, breaking loose and sticking in the nozzle, stuff like that. Clean it with paint thinner (if you're using enamels) or Windex and/or Simple Green (if you're using acrylics) every single time you use it. If you only have half an hour to paint and you know it takes ten minutes to clean it, you only have 20 minutes to paint, so plan accordingly. You can't spray and then think you'll come back and finish cleaning it later-- paint is much easier to get out if you get it right away. Being lazy once means cleaning gets a LOT more difficult. You don't need an ultrasonic cleaner or anything (although it can't hurt!), just to be attentive and careful. 

Maybe you know this already, but I'd rather post it now and make sure and save you a ""My airbrush farts and bubbles and spits paint, what am I doing wrong?"" post a week from now... And really, airbrushing changed how much I enjoy model building-- it changed painting from something I ought to do because otherwise my models would be just bare plastic (I mostly enjoyed the assembly part of it) to something I look forward to as much as the actual building part.

2184,"It means it'll turn on and off as you spray. There's a pretty tiny reservoir (mostly in the hose, I think) that'll fill up, so you'll hook it all up, turn on the compressor, and it'll run for a second and then stop.

When you start spraying, you'll get about 2 seconds of spray and then the compressor will fire up and putt-putt along as you spray, and when you stop, it'll turn off again.

You have a regulator, right? You'll want to actually set the pressure with the trigger depressed-- that is, without paint in your airbrush, spray it and adjust to the pressure you want while spraying. Then put in paint and go to town.

You may also get a little pulsing when the compressor turns on and off. You _shouldn't_ if your regulator is any good, but be prepared-- that would be a good one to try out on a piece of cardboard or whatever before throwing any paint at a model.

2200,"Assemble them to the right length, but don't make it a loop-- leave each run straight so you can paint it easily. Stick a longer piece of wire with a loop in the ends through the pin holes on each end of each run (so you can paint them without filling in the holes). 

I like to prime them with Tamiya primer or something similar-- your mileage may vary.

Assuming you're making something without rubber track pads, then paint the whole thing with an uneven coat of black (airbrush it, run it along but don't worry too much about getting the whole thing). 

Then hit it with a dark orange wash, pretty heavily. It'll more-or-less vanish on the dark black parts and will show up orangey on the parts with less black. This gives the impression of surface rust and places where the original black paint wore off and the track rusted in crevices and stuff. A second lighter orange wash wouldn't hurt either. 

If you're using pigments or ground-up chalk dust for dirt, put them on now-- work them into the crevices of the tracks, let them dry. Maybe dullcoat over them so they stay in place and melt into the crevices a little. You should now have a nice complex finish on your tracks.

Now take some very fine sandpaper (600 grit or finer), wrap it around a block, and run it lightly along the tracks to take off the paint on just the very edges of the tracks-- this should expose the metal a little on the high points, where it would get more worn off.

Now pull out those long wires from the start and wrap the tracks around the wheels of the tank-- the tracks should be flexible enough that you can carefully work them over return rollers and around the idlers. Get them set in and pin the ends together (make sure they're going the right way before you glue that last pin!). 

There you go!

Light orange washes and not a lot of pigment stuff will get you something like this:

Heavier washes and chalk will get you something like this:

I also tried starting with very dark orange and airbrushing washes over these ones:

http://imgur.com/liscbcQ.jpg

...which worked pretty well:

http://imgur.com/dWup65R.jpg

These are metal tracks with (painted) rubber track pads:

http://imgur.com/bZoeut3.jpg

I base coated with the rubber color and then used heavy orange washes to kind of get in around the rubber squares. And then I touched up the rubber squares a bunch since that didn't work very well. There might be a better way to do it, although I do like how it came out. 

But, yeah-- all the earlier advice holds true: Buy Friul tracks from guys in Poland on ebay rather than anywhere in the US or North America. I usually start at the ActungPanzer! shop:

http://stores.ebay.com/AchtungPanzer-SHOP

They throw in free gifts and stuff (like little antennas and chains and things) if you order a bunch of stuff from them, they ship quickly and pack well. 

The ASU-85 tracks up there were actually from a Chinese company called Spade Ace-- their tracks are comparable to (and sometimes better than) Friul tracks, and the do some stuff Friul doesn't (like the ASU-85).

In both cases, it's probably worth throwing away the wire that comes with them and buying a roll of stiffer steel wire (which cost me about 4 bucks). The very thin brass wire is VERY hard to get into the tracks cleanly without it bending all over the place. 

Metal tracks are great, though-- they look SO much better than rubber band tracks. They're more work, but if I really like the tank I'm building, I think it's worth it.

It's not challenging enough to be much of a build-- it took me under 10 minutes, mostly because all the parts are unique and molded to fit together in a single way. Except they interlock, so you have to put them together in the right order. It's almost like putting together a VERY simple puzzle.

They have a thin smattering of Vallejo paints, a lot of Tamiya, a lot of Humbrol and Model Master, some Tamiya primer and other rattlecans, some Model Master dullcote and other rattlecans, various other stuff like that. There are a bunch of other sorts of supplies, including a BUNCH of Plastruct MEK-based cement and some random tools-- nothing GREAT but certainly stuff to fill out a toolbox... Um, what else?

Almost no armor, although they have a few Tamiya Panther Ds (that's the new one, right?) and some unexciting Airfix and Hasegawa kits. There are some planes, but I don't know what's cool there. There are what seemed like a surprising number of helicopters. There's a shelf of smallish gunpla kits, but again, I don't know what's cool. 

There's uh no more Tamiya sandpaper or Extra Thin Cement. (They only had a couple of bottles.)

If you're nearby it's worth a visit, but I wouldn't go out of my way unless you want to stock up on very basic supplies. (I mean, hey, it's nice to not run out of primer, right?)

I made them an offer on their Vallejo Model Air rack, but they wanted $350 for the rack plus 150 bottles of paint I don't really need. I mostly want the rack. I might go back after the sale and see how much paint is left-- they're not reordering Vallejo paint, so eventually that rack will be empty...

http://imgur.com/a/uLo6g

One thing to notice is that I didn't always follow the directions exactly because I knew how I was going to do the painting and was planning accordingly. That's something you'll pick up after building a couple of models... 

I agree with /u/windupmonkeys-- starting from scratch and trying to build up your favorite starship (or tank or car or whatever) is probably going to be frustrating, especially if it's a fairly complex kit. Find something you like enough to build but that you don't care enough about that if you do something and mess it up it won't discourage you entirely. And then when you do mess it up, keep going, try to fix it, and see how it comes out when it's painted. One thing I've learned is that depending on what you're going for, model building can be pretty forgiving of mistakes. Plastic is easy to work with and there's putty to fill games, plastic strips and rods to build replacement parts if you need to, metal replacement parts for some things, and ultimately you can order a replacement sprue from the kit maker or just weather the kit to hide the mistake. 

And feel free to ask questions here. We have lots of helpful people who like to sound like they know what they're talking about... 8)

I glued some more little bits to the Leopold:

http://i.imgur.com/K0HZtXW.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/OwdOjMy.jpg

...except they're very small and you can't see them in that second picture. But it's coming together! Except the long center part was slightly out of square, so there's a gap you can see in the close-up picture at the bottom of the side... I'll clean that up before I go too much farther.

I have some nice-looking metal shells for it from RB Model (Bought from, you know, those Polish guys on eBay):

http://i.imgur.com/YZFzBYE.jpg

Kit parts are on the left. The metal shells are really great. They look good, they have a nice heft to them, and they came assembled, with the little brass ring already on there.

I have a crew set lined up too:

http://i.imgur.com/0aMFEoh.jpg?1

I'm not sure if I'll use all those guys, but maybe a couple for scale. 

But then I decided to take a break from giant train guns and got a good start on my Tiger Models AMX 10RCR wheeled(!) tank destroyer:

http://i.imgur.com/iQo6lPC.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/zhoX6AC.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/K949WJ6.jpg

It's a really nice, cleanly-molded little kit. Everything is fitting together nicely-- the only problem I've had came from not paying enough attention to order of assembly, so there's a piece that doesn't quite line up and a gap at an edge. I can clean it up, but it was kind of a silly mistake. Tiger do tend to put REALLY HUGE ejector pins on the backs of flat plate-like parts that glue to other flat parts, so there's some cleanup, but they're all in places you won't see once it's assembled. There were a couple of places where the instructions say to remove surface details, too, so maybe they'll have another variant of this out sometime. It's a really nice little kit, though-- detail where it's needed, and not where it's not. In one picture you can see where I had to make a tiny little piece to replace a tiny little piece I dropped, though. I still need to clean that up a bit but it'll look fine once it's all together and painted up. 

I have a couple of resin sets from Blast Models, too-- a set with a crew (I think I'm gonna paint them up, even! At least the driver, which is why the driver's hatch there isn't attached yet) and a set of replacement wheels. Except, well:

http://i.imgur.com/SFEKQLs.jpg

...that is some crappy, crappy molding. Bubbles in the middle of the flat parts, okay, those are fillable. But here I'd have to make new bolts! I already have the little plastic hex rod in the right size, but, man. I ordered resin wheels so I wouldn't have to do that sort of thing! I'm not sure what to do here-- they're from France and took a long time to get here and ugh. I guess I'll email them this picture and see what they say. The figures look fine, and the Panhard VBL wheels from the same people look fine, so it's just the AMX 10RCR set. 

And just for kicks, here's my WIP M56 Scorpion:

http://i.imgur.com/zlDH79W.jpg

...and the worst tracks ever:

http://i.imgur.com/2tWrd2M.jpg

It's easily the creepiest hobby shop I've ever been in, and I've been in almost every model store between Gilroy California and Portland Oregon.

The kits, though-- the guy who runs the place buys up model kits from estate sales, so (if you can get past the realization that you're looking at what was left of a stash after the owner died) he has lots of weird old stuff or unusual older kits, or just stuff that you don't see much in more mainstream hobby shops. And if there was aftermarket stuff like metal barrels in with the kit when he bought it, he packs it in and marks that it's included, or tapes it to the outside of the box or whatever. I have a KV-2 with a metal barrel that I bought from him for a pretty good price. It's definitely worth a stop, but be prepared for it to be a very strange experience. 

He has a good 30 or 40 3-shelf-tall walls of aircraft, a similar (or greater) amount of automotive kits, about 20 2-shelf-tall feet of armor, and a similar amount sci-fi and weird-60's-stuff kits. He doesn't have a lot of supplies, but if you're looking to check out unusual stuff, this is the place to go. I try to stop in when I'm down south, but I wouldn't take my wife and kids in there. 

The hands-down best model shop in the Bay Area is over in the East Bay, Hobbies Unlimited in San Leandro. They have TONS of great, modern kits in stock, mostly military, also train stuff and lots of supplies. They have a wall of 1/72 and 1/76 armor, a wall of ships, an aisle of armor, and a couple of aisles of aircraft, and a pile of SF kits. 

Here's their web site:

Short answers:

1. Assemble all but wheels and tracks (And keep the turret separate, if it has one); prime, paint base coat, and do any shading stuff, then do detail painting with a brush, glosscoat, decals, glosscoat, washes, weathering. Simple, right? 8) You have the right idea-- build first, prime, and paint. 

1.5. Yes, glue won't stick through paint.

2. Yes, acrylics are generally good. Tamiya or Vallejo are good and fairly easy to find. I like to use Tamiya primer, but pretty much anything should be okay. Be careful of hardware store spraycans as the paint may be really thick and may look kind of cruddy when it dries. 

3. Don't run a bead around the outside edge of joints, nope. Model cement isn't _glue_, per se, but rather a solvent that softens the plastic so it welds together. (I'd guess the guys running a bead don't get a very good joint, too.)

I've put together a sort of build log/tutorial set of images of Tamiya's Panzer II ausf F/G, a pretty common little tank. I go into a little more detail of what I'm talking about here, and it might answer your questions in more detail. Here you go:

Those look like standard blades, so you should be able to replace them with Xacto #11 blades (the usual triangular ones) or almost anything else when you run out of these. 

That all looks pretty decent-- not, like, Xuron cutters or anything, but they cost as much as your whole set and I don't think most people really need Xurons (even as nice as they are-- I wouldn't bother with their sprue cutters, but their tiny photoetch scissors are super nice).

If you're going to use something like Testor's Model Master cement (the odd bottle kind) also get some toothpicks and use those to apply it... If you have a steady hand you can use the needle applicator on the bottle, but I always ended up squirting too much onto the plastic that way. I usually squirt some into a bottlecap and dab it on with the toothpick.

If you're going to use the liquid cement (and you should), remember that's it's really hot and will melt your plastic good if you put on too much. You hold the parts together and touch a brush with some cement on it to the joint and capillary action will suck the cement into the crack where it will soften the plastic and let you squeeze it together a little so it welds. 

And if you get any on your fingers, wipe them off right away! You'll melt fingerprints into the plastic and it's a paint to sand off. (Ask me how I know this, heh. I do it WAY more often than I ought to, considering.)

But seriously, liquid cement and a tiny brush will change your model-building life.

There's other stuff missing too, if you compare photos of the MVTF T-55A and mine. But maybe I will anyway sometime... 

Trumpeter's IT-1 is based on their T-62, and their T-62 kit is pretty decent. Armorama gave the IT-1 a pretty good review:

Pre-shading is when you prime in white and then use a dark color (maybe black!) and go over some parts of the surface, like where shadows would fall, and then paint thin coats over that so you end up with some color variation.

You can also do post-shading, where you paint most of the model a darkish color and then spray a lighter version of that color on some panels and high points to simulate where the sun would bleach out some of the paint.

I would recommend that you assemble most things before painting, and paint only a few things separately. Gluing over paint pretty much doesn't work-- either it doesn't stick (because you need plastic-on-plastic contact for the cement to work) or you damage the paint and have to repaint it anyway. You may also find that parts don't fit perfectly, so you may need to sand or putty seams and joints, and that will also take off the paint. Basically, build as much as you can and then paint it or you'll end up having to pretty much paint it twice... 

What I usually do is build the hull and stuff that goes on it, leaving the wheels and tracks and turret off and painting those separately. 

I made a sort of tutorial/build log thing of Tamiya's cheaper Panzer II kit:

I've found this to be, for me, the best way to make sure I can paint what needs to be painted without having to do weird things to get in behind the wheels after they're attached.

One thing other people do differently is to keep extra bits like shovels and things detached and paint those separately. I mostly don't because, uh... I don't know why not, but I don't. (Mostly not wanting to lose the pieces, I think.)

I think more model builders should poke around art stores-- you're right, there are all kinds of useful things there, from sponges to acrylic retarders to really nice brushes and oils and stuff.

If you were to glosscoat it with Future or something and give it a wash to help the details pop out, and maybe go over it with some kind of pale filter so it looks dusty, it would help tie the whole thing together. 

You could also paint in a couple of details, like the oval vision ports around the commander's hatch (which would look good in a very dark greenish color). But you did some relatively difficult stuff well-- the tires look good. I can only ever get those looking good with a circle template thing, and I'm guessing you freehanded them? That's pretty great. Those are hard to get looking good!

Anyway, don't be too hard on it-- it looks good as it stands, and if you ever feel like pushing it a little more it's a perfectly good base coat for doing washes and detail stuff over.

2563,"I finished the suspension and wheels and stuff on both ends of my 1/35 Leopold. They were about 300 parts each. Here's the underside of one of them:

http://i.imgur.com/i9sZ09w.jpg

Each of the blocks on the ends of the axles is 4 pieces, one of which is about 3mm across. There's a poly cap in each wheel. The leaf springs are suspended by 4 tiny little loops each, connected to a piece made of 3-5 parts each. Then there are the brakes (3 parts per each side of the wheels, plus the crosspieces, plus the connecting things between the crosspieces, 3 parts x 2 plus 8 parts times 2 per side). Just getting to putting the wheels on took sometime like 16-20 hours. 

But here they are, with the top parts on (which help keep the whole thing flat and square-- they were slightly warped and it took some clamping to keep them straight when I hooked the top decks to the lower parts). 

http://i.imgur.com/fDcean4.jpg

That section of track is more than a meter long-- the trucks are about a foot long each, and now they're each going to get a bunch more stuff hooked to the top.

They're very large and have lots of detail and crevices. I am thinking I'll prime them in black-- mostly to make sure I get everything covered, since the lighter plastic will really stand out if I miss any spots. And then if I miss anything up in the suspension and stuff while laying down the base coat of grey, the black primer will just look sort of dark and shadowy and won't show up really obviously like patches of uncovered white primer would. 

I am VERY VERY GLAD to be past the super-detailed suspension. It's mostly going to get rusted up when I get to painting it...

2584,"Yeah, you probably will have to take the back half off to mess with the needle. You can spray without it on, too-- it's there largely for balance, and on the Krome it holds a little set knob thing to keep the needle from going too far back (and thus limiting how much you can spray, although I don't think that's your problem this time). 

What it sounds like is either your nozzle is damaged (or maybe missing?) or the needle is damaged-- the needle is what opens up the channel for paint to be sucked down from the color cup into the stream of air. If you get spray even without pulling it back, it's either stuck open (or set too far back) or damaged.

Here's another diagram:

http://i.imgur.com/R6ZcMFr.gif

The actual nozzle is a ridiculously tiny piece of metal, part R-003 or R-004 depending on which size you have installed. Note that the nozzle and the needle are matched-- I think the Krome comes with a fine nozzle and needle set, and there's a smaller, super-fine nozzle and needle set. If you put one with the other you could get similar results (or just crappy spraying in general). 

If you're missing the nozzle (and it's VERY easy to lose-- I dropped one down the drain once... 8/ ) you could also have a similar problem, very gross messy spraying. It may have come installed or it may be in a tiny little vial packed into the case. 

That's a fantastic airbrush, though-- I have one (if you haven't guessed) and I think you scored pretty well by winning one. (And congratulations for that, by the way. What did you show?)

The needle passes all the way through the airbrush from the back to the front. You should be able to unscrew the back half of the airbrush body and see the back of it and a sort of knurled nut that holds it in place. Loosen that a little and push the needle forward until it won't go any farther (don't jam it or anything, but it should poke out of the front a bit) and then tighten the nut down.

You have a couple of options. Neither of them are _great_ but here you go:

1: Careful sewing and superglue. (Superglue to keep the tracks aligned, thread to keep the superglue from breaking.) This will be touchy and may not work well, but it's worth trying if you don't want to get into option 2.

2: Aftermarket tracks. Friulmodel or Spade Ace or Trumpeter. This will be a bit expensive (shop around! Check ebay!) and lots more work but it will look MUCH better than the rubber band tracks would have. Here's a comparison:

http://www.perthmilitarymodelling.com/reviews/vehicles/misc/panther_track/panther_track.htm

...and there are probably other sets out there. Luckily Panthers are pretty popular tanks so there are lots of options.

If you want to avoid breaking tracks in the future, what I usually do is leave off the drive sprocket and idler, painting them separately, not gluing them on. When it's time to hook the tracks on, I loop them around the road wheels and then slide the drive sprocket up inside the loop of track and glue it on, and then do the same with the idler (which will be the easier to get in since you don't have to align it with the sprocket holes in the tracks). That minimizes track stretching and should keep them in one piece and keep paint from flaking off if you paint the tracks first... 

(I've definitely busted tracks anyway, though. You are not alone in your struggle.)

You can scrape them with the back of a knife or sand them onto a palette, then use a brush dipped in paint thinner to pick them up and squoosh them around. After it dries and they're kind of clumpy on there you can take a stiffish brush and brush it off again and get a pretty nice effect. If you brush off a little you get caked mud or dirt, and if you brush off a lot you get a nice dusty effect. 

I like to really work dark brown and reddish chalk into metal tracks to get them nice and dirty, then brush them off a little and sand lightly along the side that contacts the ground to get some bare metal showing. You can see that here:

2710,"Okay, link-and-length tracks. Fun times. 

I hope you haven't glued the wheels in place yet... Or if you have, use a tiny dab of CA or white glue so you can pop them off and paint them separately. 

There are two ways to deal with link-and-length tracks. One is to glue them into place and paint them there. The other is to carefully glue just the tracks and paint them separately. /u/BOB_9000 has given a pretty good overview of glue-in-place. I think I'd amend that by suggesting thin plastic cement rather than superglue (it stays soft longer), and I try not to glue the wheels into place until the last minute-- at least the drive sprocket should stay loose as long as possible since that's the piece that will determine how the rest of it lines up.

So, the glue-together-separately version. This is pretty fiddly, but can look quite good. 

What you want to do here is use thin plastic cement to connect the pieces of track together in a couple of separate pieces. You will need to do this while at least the drive sprocket is still movable. 

Step 1: Paint your road wheels, drive sprocket, and idlers separately from the hull. You probably will have to glue on the road wheels. It is very difficult to get paint behind wheels, so make sure you don't have to by painting the hull and wheels before you hook them together. Step 1 ends with the road wheels and idler attached, but the drive sprocket loose.

Step 2: Lay out the individual links to go around the drive sprocket-- go with one less than you think you'll need. Hit the places where links touch with a dab of liquid cement-- it should get sucked down into the joint by capillary action. It will take some time to cure, so you have a little while where the tracks will be flexible (but kind of delicate). 

Wrap this section around the drive sprocket (it doesn't have to be on the hull here)-- you want to have some idea where it'll end up, so you can aim each end at the next piece. These are pieces 11 and 14 in your picture there. It looks like that's upside-down, too, so piece 11 is the top of the run. So you're going to not worry about that right now. You'll need to later, but not quite yet. 

Set aside the little curve of tracks wrapped around the sprocket until it dries hard. You should be able to remove it from the sprocket and have a little curve you can handle without breaking it. This is important since you'll be painting it soon.

Step 2.5: Get part 12 and part 15 glued together and curved around that road wheel, and possibly attached to part 14. Push the drive sprocket and its track onto the hull and get it lined up with the other bits of track. 

Step 3: Do something similar to step 2 with the bits of track indicated for the idler and that end of the track run. This should be a bunch of 15s and 16s, part 13 and a 15 and a 16. Try to get a little length of track you can move around. You have a little more flexibility here because you don't have to deal with the drive sprocket.

Step 4: You should now have a couple of curves (the drive sprocket and idler, which has a flat length and a couple of extra links on each end), a flat piece with an extra link on the end (12+15), and part 11. You may be short one link on the drive sprocket. If you test-fit all the parts and they don't go all the way around, add in that spare link. This looks like something with alternating links, so you may not have any choice here. The top run, part 11, is where you're going to have to make up any mistakes, so be careful. Ideally you won't have to.

Step 5: Set up just the track in a sort of ring, pushed together and standing on its edge. Spray prime it and paint it however you want, trying not to get too much paint on the ends where the different segments will go together. Don't worry if you can't help it. Get your tracks nice-looking, separately from the hull and wheels which I assume you have either already painted or will be painting soon. Make sure the painted parts still fit together cleanly and aren't clogged with paint or anything.

Step 6: Put some cement on the drive sprocket's axle where it joins the hull. Set the painted track into place and start aligning the drive sprocket and track so that all the painted parts fit together. Use a little super-thin CA glue to hook them into place (applying it from the inside of the road wheels or other places where it won't be visible or too obvious). Just use enough to hook the tracks down. Yes, you're gluing painted surfaces but as long as you're gentle with them this should be okay.

You're done with track stuff. Give the whole vehicle some weathering, clearcoat it, take pictures, post them, lay back and watch your imaginary internet points pile up. 

Does this make sense? It _is_ very fiddly, but it lets you do a lot of track stuff that's hard to do after everything is hooked together. ",2015-07-13 04:42:45+00:00,ct1emsy,1.0,t3_3d290s,20499.0,modelmakers

Check out Badger and Iwata and Paasche at the $70-100 price point. Go for gravity feed double-action (that is, with a cup on top rather than a bottle on the bottom) and don't worry too much right now about getting a super-fine detail-painting tip. Drop $30-60 on a compressor and regulator/moisture trap (since those little hobby compressors are all pretty much identical-- the regulator is the important part. Get a compressor with a tank if you feel like spending more and worry about noise.) and use the rest of your budget on a good mid-to-high-range airbrush that you won't have to replace within six months.

2764,"I used to clean those bandsaws. The stuff that built up in there-- ""meatdust""-- thawed out pretty quickly, leaving a sort of bone and flesh slurry that got into every crack. My job was to take a pressure sprayer full of a sort of degreaser/fat-dissolver and hose them out, making sure that I got all the meat slurry out of every crack and crevice of the saw and the counters. 

On days when I had worked the day before, it was still pretty clean. On days after somebody else had the closing shift the night before, it was terrible. I was a MUCH better meatdust-cleaner than anyone else who worked there, I guess, and I knew that I was missing stuff because I was a college freshman and didn't care _that_ much. In the end, knowing who cleans the machines that cut the meat that people eat and how terrible a job they usually do, I became a vegetarian.

Once I spilled the degreaser on my hand, and it left terrible red chemical burns on the back of my hand for a week. Rumor had it that if you had shoes with natural rubber soles it would dissolve them.

25 years later, I'm still a vegetarian, and when I'm in grocery stores and somebody's cleaning the meat department, it still makes me retch a little.

You could probably also mask around the hinges-- fold them flat, put a piece of paper between the bow of the glasses and the lenses, then fold a piece of tape into an L-shape, sticky side out, and put it into the hinge itself so you could fold it into the hinge, covering the flat end of the bow where it meets the frames and ideally keeping any overspray from hitting the hinge mechanism.

2855,"Sometimes, but not usually. The market has changed a lot, I think. I'm not sure Tamiya even still makes the motors and gearboxes to drive their tanks around any more. 

A couple of things happen with older Tamiya (and Trumpeter and Heller) ex-motorized kits-- the hull around the battery compartment may be shaped funny in order to accommodate the batteries, and there are usually holes in the bottom for switches and things. They may also have upper hulls that separate from the lower hulls so you can take them off and replace the batteries-- that's not a bad thing in itself, but usually it means that there are some design decisions made that lean toward ease of opening, and you may need a lot of putty to seal up the cracks between upper and lower hull. And there may be similar hull problems around the gearbox area, and so on.

Otherwise, since you may not do the painting until you've done at least some of the assembly, you can get it home, order paints, and then start building and hope the paint is there when you need it.

You can also make some pretty basic assumptions-- for armor, if you have black, white, a rubber grey color, orange and red reflective for turn signals and running lights (sometimes labeled ""signal red"" or ""signal orange""), and some rust colors (orange/red, red/brown) that'll give you a good start.

From there you should be able to figure it out based on the subject-- a NATO vehicle will need black, olive, and leather brown. A US WW2 tank will probably need olive drab. A Russian WW2 tank will need Russian green, and so on.

2888,"I'm not surprised we're still fascinated by them. They knew what they were doing as far as looks and style went. They hired Hugo Boss to design uniforms-- US and Russian uniforms were pretty utilitarian in comparison. They had architects who took International Modernism, stuck some classical architecture in there, and came up with a look that heavily inspired the Brutalist buildings that sprung up in post-war Britain (replacing the buildings destroyed by the Germans with buildings based on German war architecture...). There are echoes of WW2 Flakturms ( http://www.airpower.at/news03/0813_luftkrieg_ostmark/flaktuerme.htm ) on every US college campus that started new construction in the 60's and 70's. (Heck, the hippiest college in the US, UC Santa Cruz, has a straight-up concrete bunker as an administration building.)

And the design of their vehicles were pretty futuristic too-- Panther tanks managed to embody a sort of chunky-but-sleek menace (even as their transmissions burned out going up hills). All those angled planes of armor looked _very_ modern and exciting coming out of the 30's and 40's, when rounded vehicles were cool. Sure, big steel boxes like Tiger tanks didn't work too well, but they were intimidating and powerful vehicles. 

So yeah, I totally understand by German stuff is popular... It's not something to be particularly proud of, but there you go.

It looks like you left off all the grab irons and stuff on the turret-- I don't blame you, since those are pretty tough to get on there without locator marks or anything... If you wanted to do that kind of thing without having to deal with the tiny plastic parts, you can use copper wire and a tiny drill (like a pin vise and a 1/16"" bit) and superglue to hold them in. It's often worth doing for those kinds of handles and things.

I'm sure you know what I mean).

And Maschinen Krieger is pretty heavily inspired by Wehrmacht stuff-- the Strahl Republic is pretty Nazi-ish, complete with caps and stuff, and a bunch of names and naming conventions are borrowed from WW2 Germany-- Lots of ""ausf. K"" and ""PaK 40"" and so on. 

I'm not going to try to say that all of Japan loves the heck out of Nazis or anything, because that's obviously not true, but it seems like there's an otaku subculture of Nazi fetishism which seems to be pretty divorced from, you know, death camps and that side of Nazi stuff and just more into the style.

2905,"Yeah-- very strange. I think it's an attempt to understand it a bit, and to get some sense of ownership of stuff that happened before we were alive. I think my own fascination with Soviet-era stuff comes from growing up in the 80's when Soviet Russia was the scariest thing out there. The models I build are the tanks that would have rolled across Europe if a shooting war had started. East Germany (original owners of the T-72M I used as the basis for painting my T-72M model) was particularly scary-- I went to Germany in high school, and I remember a tour guide taking us up to a signpost on the edge of a forest and pointing out the barbed-wire-topped chain link fence about a hundred yards away. A little ways down we could see a guard tower, and saw somebody with binoculars looking back at us, and while we watched a couple of trucks drove by and slowed down as they went. They were definitely looking back at us. 

So building DDR equipment helps me get a handle on that, and on the constant fear of global annihilation that hung over us. I've also read some biographies written by people who were growing up in the Soviet Union at about the same time-- knowing that the people we thought hated us were also scared (and were also just kids, and were hungry all the time) helps put it into perspective. 

""A Mountain of Crumbs"" by Elena Gorokhova is a pretty interesting biography:
