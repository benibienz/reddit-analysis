In the past couple of weeks, new subscribers on /r/modelmakers has jumped from a handful a day to over 300 a day. We've gained like 5000 users in a couple of weeks. I think it's cool and all, but I'm suspicious that it's something automated and not legit users. Has anyone else seen this?

Right now we're looking pretty sparse. Clearly we need a header image!

Feel like doing some graphic design? Reddit header images should be about 1900 pixels wide and 200-250 pixels tall. 

Make an image, upload it somewhere (imgur is the usual hosting site for reddit stuff, or reddit's own image hosting thing, or just put it somewhere and link to it) and post it in a comment here. If we have a couple of potential header images we can vote on them and use the one that gets the most votes, or rotate them in and out every so often or something.

I'm not a super experienced rider, but right now I ride 60-120 miles a week (depending on how much time I have-- my daily ride is about 15 miles, and this morning I rode 25), but my bike is, quite seriously, a huge piece of crap. I expect it to break out from under me without warning. So, time for a new bike. 

I ride on streets and on trails around here. The trails are either paved or packed dirt and sand, or sometimes gravel. (Mostly I avoid the gravel...) It's not TOO hilly, but there are some slopes, and I'd like to expand to riding longer distances so being able to go up and down hills would be nice. My usual morning ride has 3 long, steepish bridges over highways, but is mostly pretty flat. Ultimately I want to commute a couple of days a week, and that would be 9 miles each way, on streets. Traffic could be heavy, depending on the time of day. I don't want to go heavily off-road, but there are a couple of dirt paths I might explore. 

Figure it would be ridden more-or-less daily. 

My budget is $1500 or under. I'm already rounding up, so nobody go ""Oh, but for another $200 you could do this..."" because I would like to aim for $1300 but I can be a little flexible. 8) 

I like the looks of the Traitor Ruben:

http://www.traitorcycles.com/2015/Bikes_RubenDrop.cfm

It's a cyclocross bike, which I think would be flexible and sturdy enough for the places I want to ride, but I could be convinced to look at road bikes if that seems like a better idea. I have this impression that if I hit a pothole in a road bike it'll damage something, but I could be wrong. 

I'm not really interested in a used bike right now. I would like the support of a warranty and a mechanic and stuff before I get far enough into this to start working on my own bike... 

Any advice is welcome. Thanks.

I have updated the subreddit rules. They now include this:

&gt; **NO PURE SELF-PROMOTION**
&gt; 
&gt; If all you post on here is links to your blog or youtube channel and you don't take part in any discussions or threads, you and your channel will be banned from /r/modelmakers. We'll ask nicely once, and if you continue, we will delete all of your posts and block you from posting.
&gt; If you are an active member of the community, occasional self-promotion is fine, but ideally not more than one or two posts a week.

I know, some of you guys (I'm looking at you, Mr. /u/bfmb ) mostly post links to your blogs-- that's fine! You mostly do it once or twice a week and you take part in discussions and are part of the community. That's great. (bfmb, I've enjoyed your posts.)

/r/modelmakers doesn't exist to drive youtube views or blog hits, though. I've now had to ban one user twice for posting tons of links to his youtube channel and not responding to modmail or messages asking him to keep it down to once or twice a week and to take part in other threads before starting the self-promotion. 

So, here it is, officially: NO PURE SELF-PROMOTION. If you're a part of the sub and you want to post some links to your blog, great! Do it. If you're a random internet dude who made some videos and wants to monetize views and you don't care about the people here, go away. Is that clear enough for everyone? 

Thank you. Please keep reporting the spam.

So, community what are your thoughts on straight-up youtube links? It seems like for every one that's cool or useful (the stop-motion model-building ones or technique demos) there are a dozen drive-bys dropping a link or two to farm karma. 

Currently anything with 2 reports gets marked as spam and sent to the moderators for review. This is working pretty well, but I'm considering banning youtube links and asking people to post them as links in text posts instead. That way the cool stuff can still get in, but the drive-bys will get canned.

Thoughts?

As far as the last thing I posted (""What do with marginally model-related content"") based on community feedback I decided not to do anything at all! Right now anything that receives 2 reports is flagged as spam and sent to the mods to review, and that appears to be working very nicely (at least judging by the number of ""HOW TO BE A FAMOUS MODEL"" posts we've been seeing in modmail). Thanks for helping us keep on top of that sort of thing. The system is working! 


UPDATE:

Okay, sounds like the consensus is to leave it as-is. Please help by clicking ""report"" on anything that looks too spammy. If it's really bogus it will go away. If it's legit, one of us will re-enable it. 

I have added a new rule to make it pretty clear what's not permissible.

They were high-rated submissions back then, but there have certainly been other good models since then.

So, let's replace it! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a new header image. This will replace the model pictures at the top of the subreddit's home page. The alien sprue stays, so you might want to consider that when you're making your image.

The current image is 1921x227 pixels-- that's a pretty good size. It shouldn't be too much taller or shorter or it'll look weird, and it should be wide enough that people reading on giant screens can make the window really big without too much whitespace to the right of the image. So figure 1900-2000 pixels wide and 200-250 pixels tall.

Any model-related topic is okay, but I personally will lean toward submissions that use images from the past, say, six months or so of /r/modelmakers.

Upload your image to imgur.com (or the new reddit submission thing), link it in a comment here, ~~and the image that gets the most votes after, say, 14 days from today will become the new header image and mentioned in the sidebar.~~

The moderators retain the right to veto anything that's too ridiculous or off-topic. 

(Thanks to /u/Gewehr43 for the idea.)

UPDATE!

After the 2-week submission period is up, I will post a strawpoll and give subscribers 7 days for voting on submissions. The winner of that poll will get all the fame and glory and stuff.

I'm not going to nuke every youtube video or whatever, but I'd like to know the community's feelings about them. Oddly enough we don't get a lot of downvotes in this sub (mostly because the content is pretty consistently high-quality), but a couple of posts recently have been only tangentially model-related and they're getting hit. One of them got reported. (Not that I'm going to call them out, but whoever reported it, we _are_ paying attention.) 

So, what do y'all think about the semi-related posts? My feeling is that there are plenty of places to talk about video games and anime and , so somebody posting a model related to or based on a video game or series or whatever (""I built these Girls und Panzer tanks/this Metal Gear thing/some Gunpla/the tank from Valkyria/Fury""), or asking for advice on how to model something from other media is fine, but just up and posting a clip from a show is getting iffy. And I REALLY don't want to get down into too many ""MFW carpet monster eats my PE/DAE hate/memespam"" ratholes because they're awful. 

Here are some suggestions:

1. BAN THEM. Hardcore banhammer, no memes/videos/DAE/shitposts. I'm not really excited about this although I do have some very shiny jackboots in the closet.

2. Set up an automoderator post once a week for extraneous stuff-- memes, videos, and so on, and then try to keep that stuff in that thread. This is what I'd prefer. We have a spare day of the week without a scheduled post and if people like the idea we can set it up. 

3. If I'm in the minority, just let it roll. Maybe it'll calm down a bit, but maybe not! 12,000 subscribers is a lot, and we're growing at a few a day. I don't want to let it get out of control here. 

So you know the state of the sub right now, we've been heavily filtering users' first posts to block spam, and while we've blocked a lot of junk, we've also been happy to approve some pretty solid first posts with some great pictures and stuff.

Here we are! It's been a pretty exciting year for /r/modelmakers.

This time last year, we had 6,639 subscribers. We finished 2013 with a little over 3300, so growth has sped up a little, helped by a couple of days in February 2015 when we were a featured subreddit and gained hundreds in a day. (Here are some stats: http://redditmetrics.com/r/modelmakers )

Overall, even with this much growth, we're still a pretty friendly sub-- you should all be proud of how easy it is to be a moderator in here. I don't think anyone was banned, or even very harshly warned. Well done! 8)

The number of groupbuilds increased pretty dramatically, too-- we can't keep finished ones in the sidebar any more-- there are too many of them! (That said, there are a couple that may not have been wrapped up yet. I haven't had time to pester people about it, but I will in the next couple of weeks, so if you're going to wrap them up, wrap them up soon.)

We've seen some new builders show up and go from pretty simple builds to more complex and detailed stuff. We've seen some really fantastic builds, too, of all kinds of subjects-- planes and tanks and cars and SF stuff. 

This coming year, I want to redo the stickied post and I want to convince somebody with more time than I have to rearrange the wiki again. 

I was going to go through and find memorable builds and post links, but man. There were so many. So I'm going to throw it open to y'all. What did you think was great this year? What are you looking forward to next year? Did you learn something this year? Do you want to learn how to do something next year?

Personally I'm looking forward to Takom's AMX 13 and T-55 kits-- it's like they figured out how to get me to buy all their models. I want to get better at painting figures-- I've gotten past the initial challenging parts (painting a figure and then showing somebody else) so it should be easy from here, right? Ha. I want to actually finish some Ma.K builds (which ties into the figures since there are so many great Ma.K figures). I want to finish my giant Leopold build AND figure out where to keep it when it's done. And I want to see what you all build and post. So show me cool models.

So, mighty subscribers to /r/modelmakers, what did you do that was was cool in 2015? What did you see that was cool in 2015? What are you looking forward to, and what do you want to do in 2016? What do you want from /r/modelmakers?

Hey, cool, we're big enough that we're getting spam posts and comments! Go us, I guess!

Please report spam if you see it-- don't assume somebody already has. I don't have time to read every thread these days so I might miss things. I do check the mod queue at least daily, though. 

And if you post something and think it might be caught in the spam filter, the ""Message the moderators"" link is in the sidebar. Give it a minute or two for your post to percolate out through reddit's caches, though.

The good thing, I guess, is that I get to build out and equip a WHOLE NEW WORKSHOP! I've got a nice garage with good light and plenty of space, but it doesn't have a workbench in it. So I get to build a new one. Hooray! 

I know what I want from a workbench, but now I'm looking for ideas-- if you had a decent but not infinite budget, a good amount of space, and the ability to shape that space into whatever you want, what would your ideal model building workspace look like?

That's a lot of moving parts in there-- the toothed parts sort of lift up, and the big piston in the middle there is a big piston and slides in and out. 

I want to paint these, but I think if I do I'm going to have to choose between fixing them in place or having paint that gets scraped off any time I try to elevate the big gun.

Some of that stuff there _does_ get covered by panels and things, but anyone who gets too close would be able to see the scraped-up paint inside. 

There wasn't a particularly convenient way to prepaint this stuff in subassemblies. Plus that piston would be trouble anyway. It's pretty tight. 

I'm leaning toward just gluing the gun into a ready position and painting the parts and not worrying about them moving. Any advice on this is welcome, though... ",modelmakers,Painting movable parts,https://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/comments/3k4ro0/painting_movable_parts/

Mostly they didn't get many posts, and now there's /r/modelexchange, which is a little more current. 

Nobody noticed or complained that I haven't updated in 2 months anyway. So, one less thing for me to forget each month. 8)
