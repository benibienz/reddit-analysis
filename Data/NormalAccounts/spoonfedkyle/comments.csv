24,Brand is one of the best combo champions in the game. His kit is designed so that every order of his combo has a different effect and all four of his spells are damage spells. His passive is very unique to play around in that each skill has a different effect when having already been hit by another spell. Q becomes a stun. W gets bonus damage. E will spread your passive to all nearby units. (Note that R can be thrown in at any time on a lot of these depending on the situation) EQW is the easiest to hit damage combo. QEW is actually possible (you E while the Q is traveling) and it makes the stun a little less predictable. REW puts out massive damage against 2+ enemies that are close together (which you can then follow up with Q and more Es and Ws to finish people off that aren't already dead).,2016-11-02 00:36:29+00:00,d9ho5zw,1.0,t3_5amclo,6124.0,summonerschool

57,"No you should absolutely not be running thunder lords on brand. This one I have actually done the math on before and without pulling it all out and redoing it I'll give you the quick and dirty of why. You are right, in a 1v1, single spell combo TLD will do more damage without a question. But that is not where brand excels. He excels in his team fighting and skirmishing. Which means in all of those situations you have to calculate not only the damage of DFT on one person but the multiple ticks of DFT that you get going on several people. Also if you're going with the morello build that means you have cdr and slightly less overall damage meaning you're definitely trying to get more than one combo off meaning even more ticks of DFT. Then you have the fact that TLD has a cool down and is going to affect the first person you get instead of a chosen person. Meaning you TLD proc is likely to go off on a tank rather than a priority target. In almost every situation than suits brand win conditions it's better to have DFT because TLD is only better in laning phase in mid (not support). So if you're playing mid and plan to get the other team to ff 20 then yeah take TLD.",2016-10-04 18:26:43+00:00,d8dv90s,7.0,t1_d8di6nm,16729.0,BrandMains
58,"I still think you're misunderstanding why RDC can be a better mid game buy than void staff. The 3 stack passive plays a big part in this. You're looking at an extra 1.5% health on every target that gets hit by each bomb. In teams fights you're looking at multiple hits of that extra 1.5% health on multiple targets (between 30-70 damage depending on health of target for each person hit by each bomb). You're also looking at an extra 43 damage on each tick of DFT. You're glossing over a lot of the areas that Deathcap actually excels in. Again, I'm 100% on the void staff train (and i do honestly enjoy the feel of ludens echo at times) but there are definitely perks to RDC as well.

In terms of slot efficiency its not just item to item you have to compare. By taking void staff last you're leaving the time till you're at five items till you've spent as much gold as possible. This means the longest amount of time to where you can still buy pink wards which are probably the most gold efficient item in the game.",2016-10-04 03:37:04+00:00,d8d3myl,5.0,t1_d8d2w1j,1160.0,BrandMains

63,"Really solid post. Seriously good work for the most part and I agree that void staff is a better option, but I almost always find that's its a better option as a final buy. Its slot efficient and fairly cheap so unless I'm really needing the pen to get around someone building MR then I like to take DC first because building DC (or some other three slot item) is awful when you only have one slot left. I do agree with you that void is practically vital on Brand. 

The only mistake I see in your math is this:

&gt; 52*.6045 - 37.8 = -6.366 effective MR against you = you're dealing 107.37% damage to that target.

No matter how much you stack it Mpen will never reduce someones MR to below zero so you can never do more than 100% damage to someone.

Also, by not including math about the three tick passive you ignore the fact that getting a passive off with deathcap vs void staff (in your build example) yields an extra 1.5% heath damage on your bomb due to the fact that you break 500 AP.

This is great for roaming because it gives you the mana and cdr to clear minion waves quickly and get to other lanes and also good against champions like vlad with some kind of healing. My personal favorite start is rylais liandries deathcap, it really keeps you fairly healthy early game, and gives you early item synergy (with two NLR items and rylai liandries passives)that can really put a hurting on your lane, this good against someone you know you can win lane against/are winning lane against. And the last is the safest build, starting out rod into haunting guise into rylais into liandries. This is a solid build against anyone who's going to get on top of you and kill you quick...so burst mage and assassins. 


That's early game. Mid game you wanna look to catch people out with and E-Q-W or if you have the mechanics a Q E W. Obviously if you can get the kill then go for it after. But brand really wants to do two things after laning. Group and dole out massive amounts of damage in team fights and counter attack baron/dragon. Having their entire team in that tiny enclosed space with no minions is like Christmas day for brand. Passive procs for everyone including the objective. To sinish out the game RDC (if you don't already have it), void staff when they're stacking MR, guardian angel if you dying too quickly in team fights or zhonyas if it's due to one person like a zed or someone ult getting you every time. If you're super far ahead don't be afraid to build another NLR item in ludens echo. It's situational to close out the game. You've got to read what's been happening.

If you have any questions feel free to ask. Welcome to brand.",2016-10-03 14:33:42+00:00,d8c4wjm,1.0,t3_55n0ww,15138.0,BrandMains
74,"Yeah I disagree about cdr on brand support. I see a lot of people going for the 123 quick hit combos (which are very useful don't get me wrong) but the best thing in team fights for brand is actually waiting for moments where you can hit large groups and then saving your q as a peel tool or a chasing tool (if you've clearly win the fight) I don't find myself needing extra cdr on him.

I don't think anyone thought it was going to be an issue which is why it wasn't explicitly stated.

&gt; then FAs who were drafted the previous season should have keeper costs as though the new owner was the one that drafted them 

This is already the case for us. It goes based on where they were drafted the previous year. So, trades and add drops don't matter. The only scenario where things were unclear is this exact one.

I proposed three options initially as to how it could be handeled going from most lenient to least.

1. Let it slide and reaffirm that its not allowed for following seasons.
2. He can use either of them as keepers but their position will be determined by the ADP from 2014 as that would have been the last time they were drafted in an appropriate order. But don't penalize him the usual 1 or 2 rounds (In this case jordy rd 2 and KB round 8) and then he could choose whether or not he wants to use them or other players as his keepers.

143,"Hey guys, I'm a joint commissioner in my main league and we're having a hard time making an impartial decision regarding our keeper rules from season to season.

Last season, as many of you know, Jordy Nelson went down before draft time for the entire season. With that in mind he was not drafted at all in our league. Now we are a keeper league and our keeper rules state that you can keep two players from your final roster the year before. Their draft position this year will be n-1 if n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7 or n-2 if n=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 where n equals last years draft position. The n for Free Agent pick ups is 16. Now towards the end of last season one of our managers who was already knocked out of playoff contention tanked his team trading for a second and a first round pick and picking up both Kelvin Benjamin and Jordy Nelson in the last few weeks to use as keepers for this year. The only set in stone rule that we have had from year to year is that you can't do anything that goes against the spirit of the game and the entire league agrees that the FA pickups does just that. However, we haven't been able to come to an agreement on what should be done about it.

We have the situation covered for the future as we've added an IR spot for this season and we've made it well known that in the future picking up an undrafted player that did not play during the season will not allow you to keep them the following year. But we don't know what to do for this years draft. Any ideas?",2016-08-29 17:46:13+00:00,d71gsx2,1.0,t3_504h1d,23914.0,fantasyfootball

163,"Alright so, brand is a lot of fun to play. Since the rework his play style has changed to be a team fighting tank deterent. Obviously if you have free access to the squished then take it, but unlike a lot of mage using your spells on the tanks first is a ok due to the fact that both parts of your passive do %health. Due to the nature of being combo reliant, and somewhat shorter ranged for a mage you're going to want to build ap, Mpen, cdr and health. Throwing in a little bit of game based stats once you've got those bases covered. In terms of comboing during landing phase you want to wait till lvl 3 before you really use many spells, then from there you're trying to get your three stack passive off. Early game you can hit squished for about 2/3 of their health with one full rotation e-q-w thro in some autos and you hurt like hell. 61 damage per attack might not seem like much but it adds up. You're going to start and max in the same order WQE. Obviously take a point in ult any chance you can. In team fights you have great engage and clean up potential if you have someone else with good engage. Your ult has a slow that will bounce between anyone it can get to and this allows your team to move into position and for you to start firing off spells and getting passive procs. The nice thing to remember is that each passive proc that someone is standing inside of will also give a stack when it explodes on them. There are a lot of other tips and tricks I could go into or if you have specific questions feel free to ask.

They definitely hurt his wave clear as well. I don't know if thats something they're worried about as he does already scale very well in to the late game 31% max health starting damage (before resistances and pen are factored in) from your passive alone if you're building pen all three MPen items then you're going to be getting that full 31% on anyone other than a 2 MR item tank.

171,"Could be a bunch of different things unless you're seeing it happen over and over again. Normally yes if you have one champ with the three stack passive and two champs with two stacks that stand inside of the explosion when it goes off then two new explosions should start ticking down on the two other champs. If that's not happening it could be because their stacks have worn off by the time the first explosion pops. It could be that one or more of them have banshees meaning they only have one stack on them not two. There could be a spell shield from a sivir or morg if they're involved.  If none of that is happening then you probably encountered some sort of bug. Damage-wise that pop does a varying % amount of health damage based on your level and your AP. Late game full build it does 25% of the targets health (just the explosion not the passive burn or the abilities) before resistances and penetration are factored in.

Tp does give you the sustain of being able to instant back but if you have good wave management that shouldn't be an issue in mid lane. I only take exhaust against assassins. Fizz and zed being the most prevalent. I've gotten to the point now where I don't have ""a build"" for brand but the standard a lot of people go is ROA into cdr boots into rylais into liandrys then void and death cap. Zhonyas can be good if you plan to play super aggressive and make flash plays and such, any AP items that have health or resistances are good on brand because you lack escapes so it let's you survive long enough for cds to come back up.",2016-06-08 15:21:45+00:00,d40ylt6,1.0,t3_4n23nm,56203.0,BrandMains

352,"I mean I don't know how ""behind"" you're talking about based on your post. But a lot of times even if a game is winnable it may not be a fun winnable. If we're down four to one on towers and an inhib is down and its 14-5 with them having two drags at 20 minutes that game (in bronze) is still definitely winnable. But in order to win it, you're committing to a 50+ minute game unless the other team just hands it to you on a silver (or bronze) platter. The odds of having that happen vs having your team just drag it out to 40+ minutes and still lose are slim so its frustrating when people are saying, ""NO GUYS WE CAN STILL WIN THIS""...yeah we could or we could end up wasting an extra 30 minutes dragging this game out just to lose. The negatives of losing a long game are heavier than the negatives of surrendering at 20.

I get that a three hit passive is not an exciting mechanic, but it does give us brand mains something to play around other than blow your load and gtfo like it was previously. IMHO the rework gives brand more reason to stick around rather than blow his load and wait for cooldowns. I also think there is a case for more variation in your build now whereas previously it was rush lyandrylais sorc shoes maybe a zhonyas depending on the other laner. Now I could see a case for cdr, MPen, straight ap, and even tanker builds as that %health passive change makes him stronger the longer he can stay in and get more abiities off. Overall I think you're overreacting to the numbers and not seeing how the playstyle will be wonderfully enhanced.

If it comes out that Brand is shit tier, he'll be adjusted because unlike when a champ like urgot or yorick is shit, this is coming with their mage update so if they release a ""new"" shit champ it looks bad on them. I've played brand for three seasons now, about 10x as many games as any other champion. They're taking power out of brands solo laning and moving it into his team fighting.

683,"Its got all the logic and makings of a good build but I think the reason that Haunting/Liandry's and Rylai's are the standard first builds on Brand are that 1. Rylai's gives an enemy slow which not only allows you to better hit your abilities but also helps you set up teammates to better hit abilities. 2. The fact that you essentially can perma slow with Brand's blaze means that the passive from Liandry's will basically always be up.

I'm by no means a great player but Brand is the one thing that I do well. I usually build Rylais and Liandry's first and then start molding to the opponent team.

**Passive** - Brashie's auto-attacks and abilities apply icy-hot to your enemies. Icy-hot causes a slow and damage over time to apply. Every fourth auto-attack/ability causes a 2 second stun.

**Q**- Brashie launches a targeted ball of frozen fire that deals magic damage. If the target is seeking muscle relief with icy-hot, it will stun for two seconds. If it is also the fourth attack/ability used then the stun is doubled.

**W** - Brashie sprays a volley of flaming arrows in a cone each damaging the first enemy that it hits. At the end of each arrows range (or at the point of contact) it ignites the ground in pillar of flame. If targets are already suffering from the icy burn of icy-hot then the damage is multiplied.

**E** - Brashie gains a shield of menthol-wielding hawks around her that, when attacked by enemies, will fire out a hawk in all directions giving vision and applying icy-hot to any enemy it passes over.

810,"Not necessarily. There are a couple of things to take a look at that could make these changes swing the game to one side or the other. How fast will the bonus stats cause the waves to push? What rank are you playing at? What objectives are up when the advantage starts?

Hypothetically, lets say we're mid-late game and our first two towers are down in each lane. Lets say the enemy has a level advantage but not a tower advantage. If it used to take a 6 v 6 neutral wave 1 min to hit whichever side it was going to push towards, what if not the bonus stats make it push towards you but it still only takes about 55 seconds. Is it a disadvantage to have farm constantly coming towards you? On the other hand what if it only takes 25 seconds? Then its a huge disadvantage because you won't ever be able to leave the front of tower?

Another thing to look at is where you're at. In most lower ELOs people don't manage waves anyways. So this really makes it a distinct advantage for the leading team because they can just go to an objective and either free take it because the losing team will have all three lanes pushed on them or the entire team will come even with all three lanes pushed, they'll probably still lose because they're behind and then the winning team will take the objective anyways.

If you assume its second attempt is to instead find a 2/3 to match it with then 95% of the 5% it will be successful just as before. Now you're left with .25% of games that will feature a 5 and a solo 1 somewhere.

However small that is, I agree that that is an advantage that I had not thought of. But is putting a disadvantage on each solo player for .25% of games really worse than not allowing people to play with their friends in a competitive environment. You may think it is but I don't. If you give me the option of having .25% of my solo games at a slight disadvantage but I can play with friends in whatever way I please or keeping the current system. I'll take the first option every time.

Just as an example that means that if you were to play 2000 ranked games across the season, then 5 of those games would have you as a solo player at a disadvantage that cannot be righted by 5 other games.

Your reasoning is no different than people who say they're only in bronze because of trolls and afks. And that they're actually much better than their current rank.

This is only true if you are static and don't get any better throughout the season. Lets say hypothetically you get placed in B5 at the beginning of the season but you get steadily and steadily better throughout the season. In the current system if this is true lets say you go from B5-G5 through the course of the season.

845,"Because there are a few scenarios that will play out with split queues. 

**Scenario 1:** *All solo players go to solo queue and then dynamic queue is only 2/3s v 2/3s and 5v5s.* 

Anyone with only four people able to play is screwed.

Anyone who sometimes like to solo and sometimes likes to multi queue gets screwed because they have to play in two different systems.

Queue Timers are longer for both groups.

Pure solo queuers get what they want.

**Scenario 2:** *Solo players have the option of queuing for solo ladder or dynamic ladder.*

Fours now are able to play ranked

Queue timers are still longer.

One or the other will eventually become the ""competitive scene"" for solo players. One will become an inferior form of competition and will eventually be dropped in favor of a different system anyway. If its soloqueue that loses then you'll end up with the system that they're currently proposing. If its dynamic queue that tanks then your talking about giving a feature that a lot of people are excited for and then taking it away from them.

The way they're doing it instead is giving it a sink or swim chance. Obviously if it truly tanks then they'll revert. But they believe it has  a better chance of improving the game, otherwise they wouldn't do it.

848,"I'll try to be succinct.

Playing ranked 5s isn't a good option. Not only do you have to have a specific set of people assigned to your team but you have to have at least 5 of them available at the same time. Wanna play 6-7 games in a row. Better hope all of them do as well.

Normals is not a good option either for someone who likes the competitive side of the game. In normals there's a much higher likelihood of trolls, first time champion selects, non-meta picks (that may or may not work). Not to mention a lot of people have the mentality in normals of ""whatever its just normals"". The competitive game is what is fun.

I do think you're in the minority. It may not seem like it because its an angry minority, but everyone is basing the ""we're the majority"" off on anecdotal evidence where as the company putting these changes into effect has not only the resources but strong reasons to do accurate research in determining what's best for the game as a whole. Are they always right? Obviously not. But that doesn't mean that their research doesn't hold more weight before the new system has even been tested that angry internet mobs.

Everyone's way of thinking is selfish, my own included. Don't fool yourself in thinking that all of these people screaming foul at riot are doing it for the ""good of the game"". They think it will negatively impact their enjoyment of the game. That is also selfish. I am also selfish, in that I want to be able to enjoy the game even more than I already do.

The idea of two separate queues sounds great in theory, but doesn't work in practice as already shown by the multitude of other game modes and ladders. 5v5s is a train wreck. 3v3s is nothing. Having separate queues will force people to pick whether or not they want to be ranked in solo, multi or 5s unless they have massive amounts of time to dedicate to each. The difference between people like me and people like you is I understand that this change has the potential to fail as any major change does whereas you don't see the potential for it to make the game even greater.",2015-11-05 21:25:14+00:00,cwpvf7y,8.0,t1_cwpuvxm,746.0,leagueoflegends

881,"&gt; I can almost never get it

You can always jungle in at least 20% of your games because you'll have first pick. Odds of being able to get it at second pick are fairly high since you only have one person to ""compete"" against. I'd say add another 16%. Third you have another 12%. Fourth 8% and Fifth 4%. Now lets assume that jungle is the MOST popular role and cut all (except the first) of those values in half. 20+8+6+4+2= 40% of games if you're a jungle main in the worst case scenario should still be able to get jungle.

While I agree it should have been goalie interference, the call on the ice was not goalie interference. The refs cannot call a review for goalie interference that can only come from the coaches challenge.

*/u/jrad151*

&gt;Sometimes an off-topic post will be asking ""why the downvotes"" [or another question that might be worth answering while still being off topic]. So if you want to tell them why so next time they know we don't like that around this sub (whatever it was) you have to un-downvote them to even reply.

This one might seem unimportant to the majority of /r/hockey that has been around and understands rediquette fairly well, but there are always new people coming around. Are some of these people trolls? Sure, but for every troll or douchebag out there, there is someone who is just new to the forum that might not understand why something is being downvoted and an explanation might put them at ease rather than going unexplained which will make them think, ""Well this place sucks...people don't like me and I was just trying to contribute.""

*/u/imdwalrus*

&gt;There are plenty of times when I downvote because someone's posted something factually incorrect (like your comment) but still want to reply to correct them.

Saying, the correct answer will rise to the top is not always true. Sometimes incorrect information is posted first and since this is the internet and people believe what they see it gets upvoted. Then 1...2...7 hours later someone with a source comes in and explains why that is false. But at that point its too late to jump over them in points on the parent comment and if you make it as a reply to them it may not even be seen depending on how many comments have been made. By downvoting you're helping balance the scales in favor of the proper answer, but if they respond to you its nice to still be able to read their original comment to make sure you're getting your facts straight.

/u/MIKE_BABCOCK

&gt;There are some great posts on Reddit that are in reply to a comment that's in the negative, this just makes those comments harder to read.

This happens all the time where, I'll downvote someone posting irrelevant information, then someone comes along and makes a good post, more irrelevant info from first poster, good response. Then the first poster replies again referencing something from a higher comment in the chain and now I'm lost so I have to go undownvote re-read, and downvote again.

/u/suredont

&gt;People often edit their downvoted posts, and we miss seeing that.

With /u/tasteofflames...change of heart is the wrong phrase but his understanding of the other side of the coin.

&gt;See, I knew there was an angle I wasn't seeing. I still don't think the dimming is a huge deal, but I can absolutely understand why folks would want that given this type of situation. I certainly come back into threads when more than a couple of new comments had been posted and maybe somebody decided to clarify their point. I can't say for certain if I typically re-read downvoted posts (probably not), but I can absolutely understand that some folks do. The explanation is much appreciated.

Also, on top of all of that. Clearly there are more people in favor of removing it than leaving it as is, which since this is a community driven discussion should be more than satisfactory for the change to happen. The few dissenting opinions have either been downvoted into hell (which is interesting considering the amount of talk about not downvoting based on differences in opinion) or have had numerous replies from people who want the change to happen.",2015-08-03 02:04:26+00:00,ctpgvyp,16.0,t1_ctpg0ik,1733.0,hockey

I don't cheer for Toronto and Boston to lose anymore than any other team. The only teams at the moment I actually cheer against are either in the other division or in the other conference. I root against (in order), Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Nashville, Boston (just because I don't like their current team), Rangers.

I like the 5s and 6s divisional breakdown. I think it keeps the most teams with their rivals and keeps teams in timezones properly (which is going to happen whether you like it or not). The thing that's weird about it is some teams having an advantage within the conferences but that is going to happen when they stay with 15/17 teams no matter how you break it down. At least this way the West is even. Did I miss any big rivalries that should be together?",2015-07-22 23:11:31+00:00,ctcpsoc,1.0,t3_3e7ze1,20230.0,DetroitRedWings
1196,"Yeah, I thought of that too. But then I really started to think of it and All of our real rivalries are in the West. And as much as I don't like not having rivalries (which we don't really at the moment anyways) I hate watching games at 10PM way more. As much as we pretend like Toronto is a rival or Boston...we just don't have any hate or vitriol towards them. We need to either go back to the west or not worry about rivalries. CBJ is a natural rivalry that never got a chance to flourish due to already having in house rivalries and CBJ not being good at all. That's about to change. TBL has some possible love/hate in the making. My point is there is no team in the east that we have a rivalry with.",2015-07-22 23:03:58+00:00,ctcpipa,2.0,t1_ctcpd5c,259.0,DetroitRedWings

Potentially, but I think if he has a really good showing throughout camp and training we could see him. If we lose Pasha for a moment and if we don't have Franzen that leaves us with (in no particular order)

1. Z - Richards - Abdelkader

2. Tatar - Sheahan - Nyquist

3. Jurco/Ferraro - Helm/Andersson - Pulkinnen

4. Miller - Glendenning - Helm/Ferraro

Obviously this is all part of the ""log jam"" that everyone keeps talking about but I could easily see Jurco and Ferraro staying at GR and if any of those third liners get moved in any type of deal to free up space then that makes just a little more room for Larkin. I'm certainly not saying its a lock but it is a possibility depending on where the chips fall at the start of the season.

Obviously depending on his summer showing I would love to see

1. Z - Richards - Nyquist

2. Tatar - Sheahan - Jurco

3. Abdelkader - Larkin - Pulkinnen

4. Miller - Glendenning - Helm

Scratch - Andersson

Minors - Ferraro


Honestly if he had a really good showing even when Pavel gets back I could see:

1. Z - Richards - Dats (Since there is a possibility he won't be taking draws next year)

2. Tatar - Sheahan - Nyquist

3. Abdelkader - Larkin - Pulkinnen

4. Miller - Glendenning - Helm

Scratch - Andersson

Minors - Ferraro, Jurco

God I'm so torn as human being vs a hockey fan. Obviously I'm joyous and happy that the game is getting safer so that fewer and fewer people having life lasting injuries (especially brain injuries). On the other hand the fighting, coming back into the game after an injury (playing through), having enforcers is part of what made me love the game growing up. Obviously its not the only thing because if that were the case I'd just go watch MMA, but the thing I've always loved about our sport is all of the dichotomies (usage?) within the game. It has the finesse of soccer with the brutality of football. The pure vile spewing rivalries (looking at you Colorado) where guys just absolutely beat the ever loving shit out of each other but then at the end of the series they lineup and shake each others hands. You've got big tough goons that have sweet spots for their skilled players and even have a code that says if one of the guys on our team is a dick then come fight me over it. Don't fight him, fight me. Its almost Godfatheresque. Like if you have a problem with my family then you have a problem with me.

Again, obviously I want what's best for the players that serve our teams and play the game for us to watch, but there are times where I'm sad that I can't have my cake and eat it too, by having all of the violent history of the game with none of the permanent lasting effects.",2015-07-06 16:39:21+00:00,csty15j,3.0,t1_cstmby2,32028.0,hockey

But yeah, I can see how it could've affected Nyquist and Tatar to an extent two years, but two years ago resigning Cleary was still a good call. He had slightly lower numbers during the regular season (adjusted for the shortened season they're not all that different), but had just come off one of his best post seasons ever playing 14 games and getting 10 points. There's also the fact that we had just lost Holmstrom and didn't really have any tough guys left on the team so they likely wanted to keep him around to add some of that to the lineup even though he's not the toughest of the tough.

Certainly, last year's contract was suspect but again had hardly any affect on the team since he only played 17 games and we didn't really have any AHL guys that needed to come up during that.

Its not restricting us from bringing in a star player through free agency or trades or anything. The only thing it prevents us from doing is bringing certain guys up from the AHL, which honestly isn't that big of a deal since Cleary was scratched for the majority of the season.

Video review only works for situations that don't occur that often, but can be very important calls, while being very difficult to make that are extremely enhanced by video. Usually the best examples are things that are stationary. Hockey: Whether or not the puck crossed fully crossed the goalline or not. Baseball: Whether or not the ball was outside the yellow or inside. NFL: Whether or not a player stepped on the out of bounds line or whether or not the ball crossed the plane of the endzone.

I don't think it is at all fair to say that the refs (as a crew, not as individuals) are at their limits due to the pace of the game. I think adding 2-3 more refs would really help a lot more than video review in this circumstance. Having more refs means on average the refs will be closer to the potential infractions/dives. Using video review to check if a player was diving or not is not a good use of video review.

1569,"To me calling them a ""modern dynasty"" to distinguish it from dynasties that were in their own time modern is just silly. In this day in age, with the cap, with 30 teams, with training the way it now is, you'll probably never see another ""classic dynasty"" in terms of winning the cup four five six times in a row...its just not going to happen, Chicago across six years has been a dominant force that no one wants to fuck with. Twenty years from now, no one is going to be talking about the fact that they got knocked out in the first round those two years. They'll look at who won the cup three times in six years and say, damn that Blackhawks team was a force to reckoned with for six (maybe more depending on how they sort out their cap nightmare) years.",2015-06-22 16:20:43+00:00,csevnr7,7.0,t1_csevdum,462.0,hockey
