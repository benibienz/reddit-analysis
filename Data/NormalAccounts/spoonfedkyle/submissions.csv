1. MBP

I understand the general concept of each of the things listed above. An RFA means you have the rights to the player and can choose to pick them up for an extra year (sometimes 2? I dunno) at the tail end of their contract. This is players under the age of 2_? What I don't understand is what that means for us in terms of our RFAs. Is there a situation in which we just sign DDK to a longer term deal this offseason? If we pick up the extra RFA year, does that deal remain what his previous salary was? I understand how offersheeting works so I don't need an explanation on that.

In terms of NMCs and NTCs we currently have 0 NMCs (which is good in terms of expansion next year right?) Does that mean that there are 0 players on our team that 100% have to be protected?  What about modified NTCs where do those fall for the expansion draft?

Obviously a lot of us are swayed on our starter pokemon based on what they'll become, but if you could just choose the best of the three at each evolutionary stage for each generation how would you do it and why? [Survey from below](http://goo.gl/forms/hgIyFaMQ1A)

**Gen 1**  

*First Stage* - Bulbasaur is I think the best designed of the three starter pokemon. Bulbasaur was a new idea where as a water turtle (in real life) and a fire lizard/dragon (in mythology) are both fairly common ideas. I just generally find Bulbasaur more interesting.  

*Second Stage* - Wartortle is hands down my favorite of the nine. I just think it is bad ass. Its design gives it this look of a greek god that will rain down (literally) hell against its enemies.  

*Third Stage* - Charizard is straight up iconic. Everyone wanted a holographic Charizard card growing up. He's the strongest of the three and just really interesting looking.

**Gen 2**  

*First Stage* - Totodile just looks the best. Cyndaquil creeps me out with its no eyes. Chikorita looks like....what is it supposed to be I still don't know.  

*Second Stage* - Quilava takes the cake here. It takes the already cool idea of cyndaquil and gets rid of those soulless creepy eyes. Quilava is really sharp looking design wise. While Bayleef is also a nice improvement on chikorita I'm still left wondering what the hell it is supposed to be.  

*Third Stage* - Feralligator looks like he will fuck your shit up. Meganium is a terrible name and is basically just Ivysaur flowers on Bayleefs body. Typhlosion just lacks in comparison to Quilava.

**Gen 3**  

*First Stage* - Treecko...not even a close one. Torchic looks like  he would be top heavy and just fall over and mudkip is....a body with some random fin like protrusions...and weird talon cheeks. The streamlined look of the tree gecko is just sooooo good.  

*Second Stage* - Grovyle...I'm not a huge fan of Grovyle but he's certainly better than Marshtomp (same issues as mudkip) and Combusken is just unsettling to me. At least the look is good for Grovyle. 

*Third Stage* - Blaziken has got a lot going on...he's got a really cluttered design but still looks like he'll kick ass...the other two not so much. (Oh look Mudkip got elbow pads)

**Gen 4**  

*First Stage* - Chimchar is awesome, Turtwig is cool too and then there is god damn piplup....just soo cute. But I give it to Chimchar.  

*Second Stage* - Grotle...All three of them have terrible names and not that great of models so I just picked one. I don't really like any of them.  

*Third Stage* - Torterra is one of my favorite designed pokemon ever! He just looks like a third stage starter pokemon should. Epic.

**Gen 5**  

*First Stage* - Tepig - I'm not a huge fan of these three starters and let me start by giving Tepig's major flaw...there is no part of him that makes me think fire. But I like his model the most, his tail has personality and I think he's the most interesting to look at. Snivy is a grass snake...that also has legs and looks more like a bird than a snake...oshawott is...so round looking for an otter pokemon I don't know why they didn't give him a smaller looking version of Quilava's model. It would look much better and make him more interesting. As is he just looks like a generic ""monster"" holding a seashell.  

*Second Stage* - Dewott - There you go a much more sleak looking otter that looks like a ninja otter. I love Dewott even though I don't love his name. Shout out to Pignite for my favorite name of this generation, though he still doesn't feel like a fire pokemon. And then there is Servine who has the exact same problem as Snivy...it can't decide what it wants to be bird/snake/plant thing.  

*Third Stage* - Emboar - Awesome name, awesome look, has a mane of fire, looks like he will kill your child's igglybuff with one breath. With Serperior they finally got the whole grass snake vibe down, but unfortunately instead of looking like a suped up razor leaf throwing Arbok it came out looking like a lettuce wrapped Dratini. Don't even get me started on Samurott. What the hell is that monstrosity....Seels face, the return of those awful elbow pads from Swampert, a big fuzzy mustache and to top it all off he looks like he got his head stuck in a fossil. Worst of all generations.

**Gen 6 (Finally)**  

*First Stage* - Chespin...maybe its just because I've been watching the anime and Clemont's Chespin is one of the characters with the most personality but I just love Chespin. He's like Pikachu to me, adorable yet fierce, determined yet loving. He's just everything a starter pokemon should be. That being said this is in my opinion the only generation other than the original where all three starters kick ass. I also love Froakie and Fenekin.  

*Second Stage* - Braixen is a really cool pokemon. The idea that its still using its heated breath as the flame source but uses the stick in its tail as a fuel is awesome to me. Frogadier comes in a very close second because he still has frubbles. I didn't love Quilladin while playing the games but he was alright. Then the anime made me like him even less, he's just obnoxious and nowhere near as awesome as Chespin.  

*Third Stage* Greninja. I don't feel like this is even a contest. Chesnaught suffers from the same issues as Samurott in that I don't know what the hell is going on with his model. He looks nothing like Chespin and Quilladin. Delphox is very regal looking but isn't nearly as interesting as Braixen. Then there is Greninja who is just a really great looking pokemon. He embodies everything I want in a fighting ninja water frog. The only thing he lacks is frubbles which I get why he doesn't have them (adult frogs and all), but he makes up for it by using his tongue as a ninja scarf which is...beautiful in its own way.

I'll explain basic fantasy football, our league, and what we're doing this year to make it more fun and bring in new people. Its not complex once you get into it, the first season will always be a season of learning, but we're a fun laid back league and we just play for bragging rights\


Kyle Alexander Hansen


Ok, so fantasy football at its core is about drafting your own team of football stars, and then scoring points based on player statistics each week. You play head to head against another owner to try and win each week
Our league consists of twelve teams and three divisions. Our schedule goes Weeks 1-3 play the other three teams in your division, weeks 4-11 play the owners not in your division and weeks 12 and 13 play two of the people in your division again. Weeks 14-16 are the playoffs.



Your ""team"" consists of 15 players that you draft at the beginning of the season. A QB, a RB, 3 WRs, 1 TE, 1 Flex (which is WR/TE/RB), a Kicker and a Team Defense. Then you have 6 benched players each week.
With me so far?


Robert James


I believe so.


Kyle Alexander Hansen


Ok, so like I said the scoring is done by stats. So, since a QB throws the ball he gets points for throwing TDs and total amount of yards thrown. A RB since he's a rusher gets points for rushing TDs and total rushing yards, WR and TEs get points based on catching TDs, number of catches and total catching yards.


Robert James


Okay. That makes sense. If I don't watch the game, is it a problem?


Kyle Alexander Hansen


Kickers get points based on kicking field goals and extra points. Team Defense gets points based on good defensive plays like interceptions, fumbles, sacks and such.
Not a problem at all, the sites takes care of calculating points, your primary job is deciding who to draft and who to play...the site has lots of tools to help out with both of those things and you're always welcome to ask someone (preferably not who you're playing for the week)
If at somepoint you want to see exactly how things are scored, Go to League&gt;Scores &amp; Settings. It lists every thing you can receive points for.
That's fantasy football in a nutshell.
With me?


Robert James


Okay! Sounds good!


Kyle Alexander Hansen


Ok, so now our league. This league started with 8 teams back in 2011. Jack Jarod Lefelds Britany and Ian were all there plus some others. Then we lost Ian the next year and picked up Bustle, then we lost the others and picked up some of my friends from home last year. This year we're chucking everyone (other than Brit) who is not from home and adding all of our friends.


Robert James

Awesome! I'm excited!


Kyle Alexander Hansen

Now we play what is called a keeper league, which means you get to keep players from your previous years team before the draft (makes it feel a little bit like a real team where you would hold on to players year to year). Normally we keep two players per team and they get ""drafted"" automatically at whatever spot you drafted them the previous year. So you get rewarded for picking an unproven guy in a late round that proves to be a stud.


Kyle Alexander Hansen

Since we have new teams this year, we're still sorting out the details of how we're going to deal with keepers this year so you'll be updates later in the summer and we'll probably all sit down and has out all the changes for the year.
That's pretty much all you need to know at this point. Any questions?


Robert James

Nope! It makes way more sense than I expected.


Kyle Alexander Hansen

Yeah, its all just statistics. Its good for those of us that are fans of only one team because it gives me stake in games I wouldn't otherwise care about. Like I'm a Lions fan and normally only care about the lions, but if I draft AJ Green from the Bengals then I have a reason to watch and care about that game if its on.


Kyle Alexander Hansen

Feel free to play around with the website whenever, there are all sorts of weird tools they have on there to ""get ahead"" but as a first timer most of them won't mean much until you've actually seen it being played. Also, Lefeld, Jack and I are the co commissioners so if you ever have questions feel free to ask any of us.",BigBoysFootballLeague,For New Players,http://www.reddit.com/r/BigBoysFootballLeague/comments/3f7232/for_new_players/
47,2015-07-30 18:39:59+00:00,self.BigBoysFootballLeague,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBoysFootballLeague/comments/3f6xn6/info_for_the_upcoming_season/,,"1. We're going to try and make our addition of five new teams go as smoothly and as integrated as possible this year. As such, we'll be holding an expansion draft with the five new teams. All of the players from last years five abandoned teams will be in this draft and it will be the new teams ""keeper"" picks. They will do a two round draft in snaking order where no previous team can have more than two players drafted from it. So if 1st and 2nd both pick from Team A then only B C D and E can be chosen from for the last eight picks. This is to keep the net effect on the league neutral from year to year. These players would be ""drafted"" in the real draft by the same rules as traditional keepers.

1. Next is keepers: Current Owners get the standard two keepers and new owners get their expansion draft picks. However, a new system is in place for where in the draft you'll receive them. You'll lose -2 rounds from last year if they are an 8th rounder and above, and -1 rounds for a 1-7 rounder. IF you took a guy in the first round last year then the -1 you should incur will be tacked on to your other keeper. E.G. Let's say I took Vin Deisel in the 1st round last year and Kenny Omega in the 15th. (Those are my two keepers) This year I would get Vin Deisel in the 1st but since I took him in the first again, the -1 gets tacked on to Kenny Omega's already -2 for a 15th rounder, and this year he is a 12th rounder. If someone by chance tries to take a 1 and 2 or a 1 and 3 then we will deal with that on a case by case basis to come up with a proper solution.

1. Keeper deadline is going to be August 9th which is coming up very soon. Just a heads up.

1. Next is divisions/owners: We have the New York Division: Jack, Kyle, Rachel, Sagaria. The Ohio Division: Jarod, Brad, Lefeld, Ian and the Time Zone Division: Bustle, Brit, Robbie, Dereix. We think this leads to fairly balanced divisions while keeping some heat between people that are more likely to see each other (Sorry timezone).

1. Player Positions: 1 QB, 3 WR, 1 RB, 1 TE, 1 Flex, 1K, 1 DEF, 6 bench

1. Draft order will be determined by lottery draw. With the following number of entries based on last years standings and giving the new people an average amount of chances. Brit - 11, Kyle - 8, Alex and New People - 6, Brad - 5, Jarod - 4, Jack - 3, Bustle - 2.

1. Draft pick trades are allowed, the only rule being that an equal number of picks must change hands. So, no I'll give you my 10-15 round picks for your number 1. This is a Yahoo! rule not ours.

1. Playoffs: Start week 14. Divisional winners get an automatic top 3 seed and the two best divisional winners get a bye week. All teams are locked once they are eliminated from the playoffs.

1. Playoff Tie Breaker: Take out the first two outliers from each team and reevaluate the winner with that. This means that if player A had 120 with a 40 pointer and a 0 pointer and player B had 120 with a 41 pointer and a 0 pointer then player A would win the match because the adjusted score would be 80-79. This does not apply to regular season where ties are still acceptable.

1. Awards - Winner gets the Susie, last place gets the Sackett.

1. Bets - We talked about doing individual bet games but we don't want to make it mandatory so as not to confuse any new players. Examples: Jack v Lefeld Superbowl rematch of their favorite teams...they could make a jersey bet that the loser has to wear the other teams jersey for a week. This is optional but encouraged to create some more heat between teams (I'm looking at you Brad...)

Yes, I know this isn't the first or last time we'll discuss this (probably even this week), but its the offseason so...whatever. I haven't seen anything like this yet, but maybe I'm not looking hard enough. I'll give my reasons why it works and then I'm sure you'll all tear it to shreds (especially my hometown boys).

**Rivalries** - This setup does the best job of preserving already standing rivalries. In my opinion no one (with two exceptions) even gets a little bit shafted with rivalries. This big two are DET and CBJ. Now this seems a little odd coming from a Wings fan, but honestly we've been in the West for so long that I think anyone saying, ""But original six teams we hate them! Toronto and Boston are big rivals!""  is delusional. Toronto is the closest thing we have and even there the relationship is mild annoyance at best. Could it blossom? Sure! So could CBJ so could Tampa. But at the moment, there's nothing there. Shit I hate the pens more than I hate the leafs. The CBJ-DET rivalry already has some roots in the Michigan vs Ohio hatred, the only reason that didn't blossom larger when we were in the central is because we already had long standing rivals in the Hawks and the Blues and because CBJ was never good enough to be a playoff threat. Both of those things have changed.

**Divisional Breakdown** - Columbus and Detroit aren't going anywhere according to Bettman, so we're definitely going 15-17 unless something drastically changes. No matter what you do in 15-17 some division is going to have an advantage. At least with the proposed 5s and 6s everyone in the West is on equal footing and the East can deal to keep teams that are in their timezone. There are still Wild Cards so like Babcock said last year, (not a proper quote) ""If you barely make the ninth seed and you're blaming division alignment then you need to reevaluate your priorities.""

**Playoffs** - Basically the same system we already have except it gets rid of the staying in division Top two from every division makes it with two wild cards. Instead of dividing by division you just make the 1s the top three seeds. the 2s the 4-6 and the WCs the 7th and 8th.",hockey,Another Realignment Proposal,http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/3e9i09/another_realignment_proposal/

Ignore conferences, ignore divisions.

Do any teams get randomly stuck with another team because their biggest rival doesn't have them listed as their biggest rival?

And then to top it all off he's sitting on the habs toilet seat.

I was finding it really hard to decided on the best player/dollar on each team. Its easy to say I'll take Crosby, Ovechkin, Kane, Subban and Suter, McDavid, Eichel, Gaudreau, Ekholm and Carey Price. Then say take a bunch of 1-2 M contracts. But I'm curious as to how to create the best team with the lowest cap cost.

My main answer is Val Filppula. Especially playing against him this year in the first round I couldn't help but feel he belonged in the winged wheel and not the bolt (Sorry Yzerbros).

How would our lines look if we were doing this shit NHL '16 style. Ignore injuries (including Franzen) and ignore that possibility of making any trades at this point. What would our line up look like? Rather than line by line (if it helps) go position by position. Just for the sake of pissing people off. Lets assume we sign Cleary as well.
