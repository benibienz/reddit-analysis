Awesome job :) I chewed my poor nails my whole life (about 23 years) and stopped 2 years ago, when I graduated university.

Thanks for the tips!  I moved my green button polyp and it's already opening a bit more (has been closed/only partially opened for weeks!).  It also doesn't help that the lil sexy shrimp like to dance over all of the zoas and palys :(

How big is your tank?!  I just love the coral selection. It speaks to me!!  I'm right on the edge of adding supplements, but not sure if it's worth it or not.

3,"&gt;So your current dog is reactive/defensive around other dogs and you want to get another dog? Won't that be a bit of a problem? 

&gt;Also, you say you want a dog that will be great off-leash, but you also want a ""guard dog"" 

&gt;&gt; With a bark but outwardly aggressive towards people that are non-threatening. This might come with training. I don't want a dog that is totally goofy and friendly towards all strangers.

&gt;I don't know where you go off-leash, but most people don't appreciated having a large, off-leash dog bark at them.

4,"I appreciate your questions!

I should have clarified, but my post was getting long!  I should have mentioned that he *does* get along with other dogs, and just fine!  The ONLY time he reacts is when a strange dog comes flying out of nowhere and approaches him.  He doesn't like that and shows by growling at the dog, not attacking.  So, it's not been a problem, I just don't take him to dog parks.  He is fine on public trails/areas and I keep him on leash.  We walk by dogs and he often won't react, unless the other dog is unleashed (in a leashed area!) and they get all up in his business.  He grumbles and I get his attention and walk away or the owner grabs their dog.  I take him out with my friends and family who have labs, pitbulls, mixes, and they play just fine.  I apologize, I left this info out!  He particularly does well with puppies, other small animals, people and children.  He is ""reactive"" in that he doesn't like having strange dogs approach and jump at him to play.  He tends to react towards dogs that are aggressive themselves, and gets along with ""happy"" dogs. 

However, almost all of the time we go to places that aren't public and places we never see people or dogs.  I personally enjoy checking out new places outside of civilization, so in the woods or off trails, etc.  In these places he goes off leash and I have never had a problem.

Edit: at no point have I ever had him off-leash and barking at people.  I will not have a large, off-leash dog in a leashed area that will chase and bark at people.  That's unacceptable and I didn't think I said that in my post, but I'm sorry if I gave the wrong idea.  I don't live in a city and there are endless places to go ""off the map"" where I don't have to worry about running into dogs or people. A big part of going to these types of places is because I, personally, like to enjoy the outdoors and not run into people/dogs.  I hope that clears things up.

If you do research you may come across people strongly urging beginners and first time reefers to NOT start with a small saltwater tank. I decided to go against this as my nano reef tank is at work and I check on it and tinker with it ***daily***.

I don't want to totally deter you, but I must say, based on my own experience I can't imagine not checking on my saltwater tank less than a couple times a week. I'm okay leaving it for 1 day, maybe 2, but that's it for my comfort level. To be fair, my tank is still sort of new and working through a few bugs (dinoflagellates and now ich). 

It's a 12g Nano Cube and I have currently 1 Ocellaris clownfish, cleaner shrimp, some hermits and snails. I just got a new clownfish and a clown goby and introduced ich (ahhh!). I also have about 6 different soft and LPS corals. Everything is doing wonderfully and quick action has helped my issues settle out.

I just upgraded from the stock PC lighting two days ago to the Prime. The response from even the leather has been crazy!

This is my very first attempt at saltwater, while being familiar with freshwater &amp; planted tanks. This is a whole new level of fun and obsession. 😊

I just had an order come in with some zoas, a paly, a Duncan frag and GSP.  I know... GSP and Xenia could be asking for trouble in such a small tank.

**Currently** we have the 2 juv ocellaris, some Devil's Finger, the Xenia, and some shrooms hidden in the back. A small CUC and a cleaner shrimp who's grown like crazy.

36,"Just my two cents! 

I had my Mirena inserted last May.  For about a month nothing seemed to change (was on oral BC). But during the summer I started to get horrible cystic acne. I didn't change anything about my routine so was fairly convinced it had something to do with switching to the Mirena. It was along my cheeks and jaw, so the ""tell-tale"" sign that it's hormone-related.

Didn't notice weight change but if I went up 10 lbs., then I wouldn't have caught it anyways. 

Anywho! In my opinion, I would give it some time. I know it's super discouraging to see those types of (negative) changes/side effects. It took me 2-3 months for things to totally settle: acne and spotting. I contemplated removing my IUD but am glad I stuck with it. This is just my experience, of course!

62,"I hear you loud and clear here. I'm trying to bring down nitrates likely over 400. I've done many water changes and the levels are still off the charts (&gt;160). So stressful. They have one remaining 20 yr old pleco that hangs on. They keep stocking the tank and everything keeps dying.

At least you're doing better than me. I initially changed 40% and killed 5 fish, but they were so sad and sick. I have only done smallish (~25%) WC's twice a week for several weeks and ... blah. I just want these nitrates down!

Good luck. In my case, I'm now going to be doing weekly maintenance on this tank, so I'm not toooooo worried about stocking it (when we get there..).

This is a lot of wisdom in one post. I'm excited that you mentioned the injection because a vet friend of mine mentioned it and told me to look into it. All the more reason to look into it a little more seriously now.

What kind of exercises would you recommend? Swimming is, like, his #1 thing. He's half duck. He over exerts, so I need to work around that when taking him to the beach. Next summer he will be getting his share of swimming!

I was instructed that one of the best things I can do for him is to walk him up hills. I still don't want to take him much more than 5-10 min at a time. I feel like uphill walking might trigger some of those hind wnd muscles to work. Low impact is key, I know.

I really thought I had did a big enough WC to reduce nitrates yet not too big to shock them, and I acclimated them for between 1 and 2 hrs. This is were the errors were made. Perhaps a smaller water change and longer acclimation could have saved these fish, or, the fish were doomed anyway. I just feel awful.

I initially tested the ammonia, and then completely cleaned out the tank after removing gravel. Like, we started fresh. I was confident that this would not cause an immediate spike (I've been wrong before...). The clean-out was Sat and I did another WC yesterday: Monday night.

Your initial observation really hit home for me, thanks so much. That's really what I had been thinking, but was second-guessing myself.

I tried to explain to the owners that these fish were not healthy and that the water was pretty bad.

I tested ammonia (another ammonia test is due soon as we will be re-cycling the tank essentially) and it *was* okay, of all things. I was surprised. 

Anyways, the ammonia will need to be monitored closely. I just did a big water change so we **should** be okay for that for a few days. It's just one pleco in the 85 g and I told them to lay off on the over-feeding they've been doing. Siiiiiiiggggggghhhh.

I don't even know this species. Please pardon my ignorance! Is this a leather coral?

So, in a week's time the water got low (I did not top it up quite enough, lesson well learned) enough for the pump to spit out air and essentially this coral was exposed to that flow. It obviously did not like having the water/air bubbles flowing on it and the polyps (?) have note been extending.

I'm a little worried about this coral. It's been a week since and it looks a little better than it does in this pic. Any input? Will it die because it was exposed to the output with air mixed in?

Things settle down when I am really good with my routine (AHA, BHA, CeraVe foaming, CeraVe moisturizer... etc) and not picking! I get monthly flare ups also.

I was pretty worried about these guys! With expedited shipping, they were expected in 1-4 days. In reality, it should have taken 2-3... but it is what it is! They were in transit for over 7 days, and braved the chilly Canadian climate. 

Shameless promo to the seller: what great quality and service. Things were packed well and the shrimp, though pale from stress, are absolutely gorgeous. I will definitely be ordering from them again. Let this be a PSA for my fellow Canadian shrimp lovers, who also had a tough time finding shrimp! (At a great price)

These are supposedly fire red shrimp (like a high grade RCS?? I'm learning guys..), and I'm in love. They are so active and absolutely demolished an algae wafer, which is so fun to watch. I never, ever imagined they would make it through 7 days. I just wanted to share my experience with you guys!! 😄

Edit: ordered 10 shrimp. Got 10 beautiful adults and 2 shrimplets at 1-2 mm in length ❤❤

1x wisteria, 1x java fern, 1x marimo, and a bunch of java moss
Stick of driftwood

Params are good! 0/0/5
Temp maintained at 22C/72F
Recently changed water sources, so GH/KH are improving. Going from soft to hard-ish water, and the shrimp actually seem to be doing far better.

Light is just the default one it came with. Would like to upgrade and try the Fluval clip-on LED. Light is on from 6am to 5pm. The tank is on my desk at work. Still playing with light times!

I just started root tabs (like, last week). Dose CO2 Booster daily. Definitely gonna keep up with the tabs and see if that helps.

I actually had pretty bad brown film algae/diatoms, but that went away and now I have these dark, blackish spotty things on the plant. I still have a bit of diatom growth on the sides, no biggie.

This seemed to happen when I started with ferts and CO2, if that helps!",2015-09-16 15:23:08+00:00,cv3k1q2,2,t1_cv3ihq7,2471,Aquariums

It's very dark colored and was driftwood I plucked off the beach. I boiled it for many hours and soaked for days.

The wood was a red flag and I took it out this morning. If this is the culprit, I'll be relieved and hope it hasn't seriously affected the survivors.

Not new. Been up and running for at least... 4 months. I watch the params fairly close and I am certain it is cycled.

I listed the plants I have in the tank, besides those I just have some diatom/biofilm/brown algae that they are always grazing on. I think they get lots of food there because I notice their GI is always full of darkish food matter. Hmm.

211,"Yes! This is the struggle I'm having. It sucks, for sure.

GH was good! Well, it's not on either end of the extreme. Thought I mentioned it somewhere in my mass of text haha. It indicates that the water is a little soft; but that *shouldn't* be the issue. Maybe they came from hard water and this is just too much of a change for them... Regardless, I'm looking to introduce minerals etc. to help raise the hardness. Maybe that'll help...

Molting seems to be fine. The dead ones were in tact and not in the process of molting. I watched one moult a few days ago and it was cool! 

All that said, it does seem as though one molts, there's a death. Not saying there's our issue right there, but I always seem to notice a moult that was just shed and a dead shrimp. Hrmphf.

Took him to the vet the next day... sugars were normal! ??????? Xray was normal too. 

So here we are today, and the 2nd day on Pepto Bismol. He **seems** to be almost improving! He went from entirely limp, lifeless and unresponsive (for over 72hrs) to now holding up his weight and lifting his head. He was eating well from a syringe but he voluntarily ate his kibble for the first time yesterday.

Also, after eating his kibbles, a little while after I noticed a very suspicious looking dark, sticky poop.

So, they all made out fine for several months and I wanted to upgrade to the cherries. The preggo female seemed to have ""lost"" her eggs, I thought she just might have dropped them due to being sterile or something as I never saw babies. I was then afraid the ghosts were aggressive and would really pick on the cherries - so I moved them to my 10g planted at home :) today... surprise! A lone baby!

257,"Thanks so much! I *never* thought I would have gotten such positive feedback from everyone! :) I think what you're looking at is a moneywort? I'm definitely no pro. The others are a sword (?), a cabomba, moss ball and some sedge... ? I quite like the moneywort because it's sturdy and tall! ",2015-07-05 13:09:41+00:00,cssseya,2,t1_cssk5wm,32426,Aquariums

260,"This is a great question, and if anyone has any tips I would love to hear them!!!

It's tough. What's harder is trying to feed my 2 baby bn plecos, because my piggy betta seems to love algae wafers, along with the rasboras flakes... siiiiiiigh. We had bloat issues in the beginning when I was just realizing the issue, but a day of fasting fixed that. He has a roundish belly as his norm (not *bloated*), but he is happy, healthy, has healthy bm's and is currently building a bubble nest :p

I feed everyone once a day, and I am still playing with it. He gets Hikari betta pellets, three a day (might go to two). After he's fed, I crunch up the flakes very small and feed the rasbs in an opposite corner, away from the betta. I feed small amounts of flakes at a time, and they are fast enough to get it all before he can figure out what he's missing! Seems to work :) this way, he only gets a couple of small flake particles at most. They all get frozen bloodworms once a week. 

For the snail, I like to give him pieces of algae wafer. I literally have to pick the snail up and place him on the wafer haha. The betta picks the wafer up and carries it away, if I don't!!!!! ",2015-07-04 18:12:50+00:00,css4vvp,2,t1_css4imb,735,Aquariums
261,"Believe it or not, things seem to be growing really well with a single 14W bulb from Hagen... just a T8 Power-Glo. This whole setup is a Marina kit, and it came with a Sun-Glo bulb. Same watts, just different color temps and lumens... different spectral peaks as well? Still something I need to learn more about, a little rusty haha. But yeah, it's pretty low light I guess (ideally 2 or more watts per gallon is ideal, based what I have always read) but things seem to be growing okay! I also tried an Aqua-Glo but I like Power the best.  Will upgrade lighting in the future!

Stock... I currently have my lovely betta, who's such a great little guy; 5 Harlequin Rasboras (trying to make a school of 8, but 5 is working well so far); and I have a fast-growing apple snail in there, you can see in the back.  What you *can't* see are the two Bristlenose Pleco fry I have in there. A friend surprised me with a couple of these guys at work, in a jar, and silly me, I took them. I am absolutely aware of their space needs and am excited to upgrade to at least 29 gallons in the coming months! 

Everyone gets along well!! I think I am at my stocking max, or just a little over.. I have a couple of ghost shrimp I need to add (from another tank at work). The betta is a chill guy and I anticipate that it **should** be okay haha.

262,"So all I do is add root tabs, then dose CO2 booster daily.

265,"I have been trying to keep on top of those dead leaves - there are a few more that can go. Was a little wary of it, but it makes sense that the plant would respond by sending out new ones faster. It seems to be a fast growing plant... Since I've gotten it, it has sent a new leaf up every 2-3 days! I'm surprised the cabomba has done well so far...

267,Yes!! Thank you so much - I'm actually experiencing that right now and was really worried. I already see a new leaf coming up so I don't think all is lost just yet. I frequent r/plantedtank! It's pretty low-tech but things seem to be doing okay. It's just over 2 months old now. Thanks again!!! ,2015-07-04 15:19:22+00:00,csrzt3n,2,t1_csry6xh,3990,Aquariums
