I ordered 10, and they were all adults. 2 babies came as incidentals ;)

So, I've had 3 die since their arrival.

They spent 7 days in transit, and honestly I'm just excited any of them arrived alive! And they all did! Woohoo. Now I'm experiencing these slow die offs. This. Is. The. Worst. 

I understand that stress and deaths happen with these guys. My concern: when do I recognize there is an issue, and not just ""that one didn't make it because of the travel/stress"". :(

You guys were ***so helpful*** when I last pleaded. I took all of your advice and had some happy shrimp and they were thriving. 

Specs:

Fluval Spec III
Fluval Shrimp Substrate
Small piece of driftwood
Plants: wisteria x2, java moss, marimo ×1, banana plant ×1 and an unknown hitchhiking plant... the name escaped me. 
I dose CO2 Booster (I find it significantly helps plant growth - it actually amazes me... I tried stopping it for a week and ended up starting right up again). 
No other additives yet. Plants are flourishing (stock light ain't half bad for low-light plants).
I have a couple mineral rocks in there
I also have 1 catappa leaf in the tank

Current stock: 2 RCS, 1 male ghostie (he may come out soon... he is not bothering the other shrimp *for the time being*) and 7 remaining painted reds + 2 teeny little babies.

With the new shrimp, I noticed some of those little worms. *Scutariella sp.* ? Gonna salt bath them today while I do a healthy water change and re-test all params. 

**I'm afraid I might have some sort of bacterial infection in my tank that is slowly killing the shrimp.**

Params have been consistent at:

pH: 7.2
Ammonia: 0
Nitrites: 0
Nitrates : 5-10, always &lt;10
Temp: 77F

Actually, now that I talk myself through this: KH is low. Like, 20 mg/L carbonate (I'm not sure about the conversion to the well known units). This low KH only happened when I switched to the FSS from an inert sand I was using. With this, pH and KH dropped noticeably.

Yikes, I don't know guys. I certainly do NOT overfeed: this is a mistake I was clearly making in the past. They devour their food in an hour or less: some shrimp pellets and algae wafer pieces from Omega One. They won't take veggies :( 

These guys all seem highly active, bright, colorful and are constantly grazing the moss and swimming everywhere. To me, these seem like happy shrimp.

The shrimp that have died: the first looked like a typical dead shrimp. The body was intact and opaque. The next one was actually mostly eaten (it was Saturday and I did not feed them... the ghostie probably was to blame for the headless shrimp here). The last shrimp... it had some black on it. A patch on its side, down by its tail. I took it out and the shrimp seemed to fall apart... and smelled bad. ?! This, to me, is not a good sign.

Help!

I adore this guy. We talk about our dogs being our best friends, and he really is.

I guess... I really would like to see if anyone is willing to share their experience, and perhaps what they did or would recommend to do to help my boy along!

He is a mastiff/lab (we think). But almost has a rottie look to him. 

I guess he will be 7 in March, and after an unfortunate event he has ultimately torn both ACLs. *sigh*

We have gotten one leg repaired and it has been over 2 months since then. The longest part of the recovery has been his hair growth!!! He has seemingly done remarkably well. He will be due to have the other leg repaired in December after another recheck and discussion with our vet.

He has lost a good bit of weight and looks great/toned at ~105 lbs. At his heaviest he was 135 lbs (yikes!). It's a great priority of mine to keep his weight right here as to not put **any** extra strain on his joints. 

He's been on glucosamine/chondroitin and, maybe it's just me, but it seems to be helping a ton. At one point, a couple of doses were missed and it was noticeable in his behavior. 

I don't want to over-do it but I would like to supplement his diet with some protein. We need to start doing some slow, uphill walks to build up the muscle he's lost. I wonder if adding some ground beef or even chicken pieces might be ok?!? He'd love it of course, and it would be more of a ""supplement"". I don't want to change much of his diet. He's on a good senior/low fat food and, again, has done well.

I want to keep him on a joint supplement. I'm running low on this stuff and have been looking at options!

He's a big dog. After, hopefully, this adventure with ACLs is over... in his older age I know we will end up battling more joint issues, possibly hips. I'd like to do everything I can to help him now and as a preventive measure.

I posted a little while back about this tank that I was hired to ""overhaul"". They wanted me to completely run wild and look after things. They had 2 really old (~20 yr?), big plecos and some tetras. Fish were constantly being added and dying. Everything is now dead but the biggest pleco, and I'm panicking. If that last pleco dies... I'll be horrified. I know this is the nature of the hobby and things die, but I can't help but feel so, so guilty. These fish lived in really rough conditions for years (the tetras would just have lasted a few weeks tops) and now they die on my watch. 

So, 85 gallon. It was a saltwater which was converted to fresh and has been up and running for likely 30 years. It has not been touched in 5+ years, except for the occasional top-up of untreated water. :( I'm amazed it was still running, but it was.

I added a heater and temp is stable at 77F. It was unheated and fluctuated from 59-68F (Canada temps... you know). 

Original params:
Ammonia: trace, &lt;0.25
Nitrite: 0
Nitrate: off the charts. &gt;160

I completely changed the substrate and mucked out 6 gallons of thick sludge after the several layers of gravel were removed. The fish were, I thought, happily chilling out in their large container. One of the tetras had Dropsy and died that day, poor little guy. 

I had sand that I rinsed really well and added that in. Added a couple of rocks and left it at that... keep it super simple to start. They had 3 old corals that were decades old and disintegrated so I tossed them (come to find out they wanted to keep the crumbling and algae ridden coral? Oh man). I kept the same filter but scrubbed the crap out of it. AquaClear 110. I kept a couple good handfuls of substrate in a stocking and it's sitting in the tank. I realize we-re running the risk of a partial cycle with fish-in, but I'm past the point of issues and I would not normally do this. I did not foresee things turning out like they did. :(

Anyways. I only saved about 20-30 gallons or less to keep the fish in. I didn't want to do a 100% WC on these fish, but I wanted to change as much as possible -&gt; nitrates. I added all new, **treated** water (Prime) and over the course of 2 hrs tried to acclimate these poor fish to new water and temps. They all seemed to be doing really well! Except for the Dropsy fella.

I eventually added everyone back to the tank and everyone is doing really well and things are running. This took about 6 hrs and I was beat! Things looked good so I called it in for the day (Sat).

Next day (Sun afternoon): all tetras are dead and the smaller of the plecos is laying on its side. I go back in and mourn... I was so discouraged. I had NO IDEA what had happened. I threw in 6 big plants to try and help things along (java ferns and a giant anubias). 

Tested the water again to see how much it might have dropped after the ~70% water change. **The nitrates did not budge. Still &gt;&gt;160ppm**. Omg. 

So today, I gather 45 gallons of RO water and I want to WIPE OUT these nitrates! Or at least dilute them a bit?!?!?! I do the 45 gallon or ~55% water change and... nitrates have not budged again. Exact same value. I'm talking deep burgundy when we want pale orange. I tested their tap water -&gt; 0 nitrate. The kit is fine, I use it frequently.

Now I am sitting here at a loss.
Surely I screwed something up here. I'm really frustrated and discouraged with these nitrates and think that these poor fish were just barely hanging on, and the change I put them through... they just couldn't handle it. That's what it is currently looking like, because I thought I took all the precautions here. If I could go back, I don't even know what the right thing would have been to do.

If this last 16"" pleco dies, I'll be heartbroken.

Any advice or input is really, really welcome. I have pics of the process if you're interested. Just had to get this rambly post up asap to try and reach out.

I just acquired a new maintenance job and the first task is to basically completely tear up and redo this tank. Check out the pics.

We have some real dinosaurs in there: a couple of 10+ inch long plecos (one is probably 14-16-ish inches. 

The first thing: I know these fish are due for a bigger tank. I know, and it makes me a little sad. I think this is a 90g-100g, but could be off a bit (don't have exact measurements... need to visit and get more details, obviously!!). They are easily 10-15 years old and I wish they had a bigger tank to enjoy. I don't think there is much I can do here, but would like to rescape/overhaul their home to their advantage. I expect to get a little grief on this, and will graciously accept constructive criticism! They *seem* healthy and happy....... given the conditions. I think a nice, hefty piece of driftwood will be our first addition. 

Other (remaining) stock: 4 silvertip tetras and 1 rosy tetra. 

No heater. (I am getting a heater!!!)

1x AquaClear 110

2 fluorescent bulbs. Not 100% sure on watts, looks to be 25-30W x2 T8 ?? (ergo, not much) Will confirm and do some easy, low-light plants. Will upgrade if they will allow! Some new bulbs are due.

It does have 1 extra pump, for which I'm not sure its purpose... likely extra flow? Maybe a surprise sump somewhere.......

It used to be a saltwater tank, and the rocks are remnants of that. The gravel, rocks and decorations will go. Woo-hoo.

I will be doing weekly maintenance and am debating on sand vs gravel. Trying to balance aesthetics and upkeep haha.

My rough idea, to start: some white or black sand would look killer, but I wonder if this is a smart move in terms of upkeep. Maybe some white sand/natural stone combo (always liked the look), with some plants and driftwood. Keep it simple and neat.

I want to do some nice and easy, peaceful fish. What might be some cool community ideas for a 90+ gallon tank?? Hmmm??? They have the plecos and those couple tetras. Maybe some colorful schools and a showpiece fishy/fishies? **Let's hear your favorites!**

I have bettas at home, with some rasboras, bristlenose plecos, snails, etc. A little boring but I like it. I have a shrimp tank at work and look after a saltwater tank at a big office. I'm just lacking a little extra creativity for this tank. 

I suggested some (fancy, maybe) goldfish, which would make a cool tank. Messy maybe. They've had goldfish, and are not interested in cichlids (I tried!). They would like some schooling fish. What about some showy fish? I'll try to resist a betta. ❤

Any tips, tricks, advice are really welcome. I know this is a big job and I have my work cut out. I need to make some changes to this tank haha. They are really cool people, but have just lost their love of upkeeping a tank which is unfortunate for the fish but fortunate for ME! :) they'll cover costs of purchases.

So, I'm ever *trying* to improve my little shrimp tank. I posted a while back and I seem to finally have things under control. I was definitely over feeding, and I feel really bad about it. I've lost 4 RCS over this process and you guys helped me to not lose any more!!

I have a Fluval Spec III with inert black sand. I just got my paws on some Fluval Shrimp Stratum and so I'm planning on a change out. The tank has been running for a good part of the year and I have never had any issues with parameter fluctuations or the like.

Anyone do this?! I'm trying to make it as easy for my shrimpies as possible. I just have 2 RCS now and a lone, surviving ghost shrimplet haha. 

I can save just about all the water (~2.5g). Put it in a bucket with the plants, and then keep the shrimp there. I will keep the massive filter with the carbon and biomax inserts, to maintain as much bacteria as I can. I think the huge sponge will help me in this situation!!!

Once things are out I'll pull out the sand and add the stratum. Now here is where I'm eager to see if anyone can help!

I was thinking about adding new, treated water from the same source as always. Let things settle out and run the filter for a bit. Once things have settled, I was going to figure out how best to acclimate the shrimp. I think I want to add pretty much all the water back, so I would have to take out the ""new"" water I put in. Doing this I would have to mix the water... ? Before ultimately putting the shrimp back in their tank.

I had some RCS brought into my local pet store and took home 6. It's been about 2 weeks or a little more now. I'm down to 3 shrimp. What could I be doing wrong?

I've done lots of research and thought I may have narrowed it down. I took some corrective action and have gone a week without any losses. I just lost another today. :(

I first thought I was over-feeding (very well may have been the case), and fixed that. Maybe I was too late and there is lingering damage. I now feed them very little and remove uneaten food after several hours. They seem happy and their eager behavior towards food, which is new, is a good sign to me; and a sign that I was over-feeding before.

These 3 are highly active and are all males. I think the 3 that died were females: they were big and colorful. Ah! &lt;/3 They swim around the tank and actively graze. They love hanging out in the wisteria.

Wisteria, java fern, marimo and a sprig of some unknown, tag-along plant
No ferts, dose some liquid CO2 daily/every other day
Some brown algae/diatom growth that they seem to *love* to graze on

I mostly feed tiny pieces of Omega algae wafer and/or Omega shrimp/lobster pellets in the morning. Excess gets removed.

I had a piece of old, weathered, dark (and soft...) driftwood in there. Maybe that was hurting them (it was boiled and soaked). I have taken it out and now just have plants.
I want to get some mineral rock (just to see if it helps, no harm?), catappa leaves and java moss.

I was doing tiny water changes daily, like maybe a cup of water - just replacing the water I would take out when I sucked the bottom of waste. The last week, I would still remove waste but took out less water and stopped doing the daily water additions. Thought I would just do 1 weekly change of ~30%.

I thought I may be hurting them by using bottled water, so I transitioned to tap water. Perhaps lack of minerals from said water was killing them? 

Between switching to tap and changing up their feeding, I thought I was golden! I was losing a shrimp every other day and then none for a week.

Last week I bought a hardness test kit. Water is a little soft (60mg/L CACO3) and the KH tested O.K. I thought: 60 mg/L (""associated with a low pH""... but my pH is 7.4).

Golly, what else... hmm.

I'm really at a loss, folks. I tried to troubleshoot the best I could with the research I did on common issues with these little guys. I understand they don't take well to stress and changes. I did a very gradual introduction to my tank, and another gradual change with the new water. 

I may not have any losses with these last three, as the first may have been weak/ill to begin with. Or maybe I am still doing something wrong.

I'm getting a little discouraged at this point. I really want these guys to work out, as I've wanted a RCS tank for so long!

I want to order more shrimp (from a different supplier/store), but first: what can I **possibly** do to prevent/stop me from hurting them?

I plan on taking him to the vet as soon as I can. But I am trying to see if there is anyone that has dealt with symptoms like these, and can give me absolutely any insight.

I have dealt with adrenal and insulinoma and other cancers in ferrets, and yet these symptoms are not familiar to me.

I am leaning towards heat exhaustion or the slim chance he could have gotten into something.

I tried taking his sugars but I could not get a good sample. Will try again later, but he felt warm and didnt want to push it. 

He just drank some water.

Please, if anyone has any advice before I can get to a vet, please let me know! He is absolutely breaking my heart.

**Edit!** went to the vet and spent $200 for them to tell me there is ""nothing"" wrong. He can't stand and is still very limp, of course there is something wrong!!!

They did an xray and took sugars. No lumps, bumps or masses. He had a little runny stool today and see more stool in his colon. Sugars are low but very normal (he hasn't eaten).

Well, I got some high energy canned food that should be easy on his belly. No change but he ate up the food! Positive thoughts appreciated. What a mystery...",ferrets,"I need help, please.

Is some paling normal? I had two very vibrant shrimp, females likely, and one is much paler. The other is fine. I had 6 and lost one yesterday! I was heart broken!

Parameters are good. 0/0/5 or less. Temp is stable at 22/72. They are in an established Fluval Spec III. There is black sand as the substrate, piece of driftwood, a wisteria, java fern frond and marimo.

They get shrimp pellets and crushed algae wafer (Omega One). They get very little food, and left overs are sucked out with a baster haha.

Any ideas? Advise? Input? Any tips are appreciated. The one that died did not pale dramatically. He may have been molting.

I want to do the best I can to prevent deaths and harm to my babies!!! Should I be concerned if they vary in color from day to day? Thanks guys!",Aquariums,"Little worried about my cherry shrimp.

I've been feeding Hikari betta pellets (2 a day), and supplementing with frozen bloodworms. My fella is super active, curious, and a joy to watch. Because I have other fish in the tank, I do struggle with him sneaking in extra bites of food - even though I try my darndest! 

I have a snail and two pleco fry. The betta LOVES rushing to the bottom and trying to steal the entire algae wafer, which is nearly as big as he is. ?!?!?!? 

He is constantly hunting the bottom of the tank for any fallen food. Obviously, not overfeeding the other fish is important here.

I wonder if I can improve his diet? Love to hear what other people use! 

My betta is never bloated to the extent in which I see pictures, like to an extreme, but I have fasted him in the past and it helps. I just want to do the best I can to make sure he's getting the best diet, and if there is anything I can do to help then I would be very thankful for suggestions!

Thanks folks! :)

PS - anyone willing to describe a normal, healthy betta poop!? I think I can spot them in the tank, but just want to be sure!

I noticed one of my Harlequin Rasboras has the tiniest little white fleck on its bottom lip. It looks similar to what image searches look like. I have 5 rasbs in my tank, and I know I don't have a proper school yet. I would like to get 3 more and see how they go. I notice a little bit of chasing around and one of them is definitely a ""dominant""! They all (including the ""ill"" fish in question) are highly active and are voracious eaters! 

I read up on bacterial and fungal infections, particularly on cottonmouth/columnaris. I don't think this fish is sick, and have read that many people that see this on their rasbs have it clear up in a couple of days. I'm hope that's the case here. 

Water params are good - 0/0/5. Ph is 7.6. I just lowered the heater to maintain around 77, but typically runs around 78 or 79. Planted tank with a betta and apple snail.

If this white spot does not clear up, what should I do?!? I would ultimately like to know what general meds I should have on hand. I see Pima and Melafix are a couple of common ones.
