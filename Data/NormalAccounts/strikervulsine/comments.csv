There were 6 of us playing, so we split into two squads of 3 with some randos to fill the extra spots. RIght off the bat I grabbed the MG15/08 sentry kit and I proceeded to use tha thing through 90% of the match.

My squad would lead the push, with me up front soaking damage and being a distraction, my medic right behind me keeping me up. We'd take a piece of cover, reload and heal, then do it again while my other squad of friends moved up to take the position we did.

It was fucking awesome.",2016-11-14 15:53:59+00:00,d9zwg9i,1.0,t3_5csn6u,61026.0,Battlefield

94,"Ok Op, here goes.

So barrel length is measured from where the rifling begins to where it ends. 

With how the AR operates, the barrel begins roughly where the receiver ends both because of the length of 5.56, and because the bolt locks into an extension of the barrel, also called the barrel extension.  So if you buy a 20in barrel, it's actually about 22 inches and change long (maybe more, I honestly haven't measured)

However, because 9mm is about half the length of 5.56, AND because the bolt of a 9mm AR doesn't lock into the barrel, it just rests against it, the barrel of an AR-9 actually starts inside the receiver.

[Here](https://imgur.com/mNpR9WB) is my AR-9. It has a standard carbine length handguard and an 8.3"" barrel.

Fear of terrorism, fear of Clinton, fear of the other.  And unfortunately it's made me abit afraid because scared people do crazy things.

We rail against gun control advocates for using rare but highly publicized mass shootings, gang violence, or suicides to call for gun-control, but at the same time we get terrified of the terrorist boogyman even though it is a rare and sensationalized thing.

Instead of standing tall and saying ""give me your tired and poor and huddled masses"" we put up fences and armed guards, scared that a tiny amount of us will die. We invade countries, destabilizing them, and then wonder why there is this force that hates us that pops up in the power vacuum.


And I'm not saying we should help others and damn the poor of America. But I really don't think Trump and the GOP's method of deregulation, tax cuts, trickle down approach works, or at least works in a way that is acceptable.

For one, the guy in the gif spawned on his team mate.

For two, the game actually tries to do that. If a flag is contested the spawn position moves away from the flag.

For instance, on St. Quienten's Scar on C, if the flag is contested it spawns the Germans about 75 meters north and thr British 75 meters West-southwest.  However, due to the ebb and flow of conquest, that brings up the possibility of the Brits spawning in danger if the Germans are attacking from F or E to C.

And you know what, I'm ok with this. In fact it's good strategy to camp the spawn if you're taking the flag. The enemy team takes a risk of they spawn in a contested area.

The Del-ton is alittle bit lighter, and doesn't have that build up before the break, it's a smooth pull that feels the same weight throughout.

The CCMG might be fractionally lighter than the Del-ton, and has the same smooth, consistent weight to it the whole way.

The No-Name-Vendor one I'd say is alittle heavier than the Del-ton, but just fractionally lighter than the second hand. It has just a fraction of a take-up before hitting the wall and breaking.

The RRA 2-stage has maybe 16th or 3/32nds take up before hitting the wall, and then it feels at least as heavy as the CCMG trigger, the CCMG must be on the low side of Mil-spec

You can either do that, trim a few coils of the safety detent spring so it doesn't put as much pressure, or just flick it back and forth like that until it breaks in.

416,"&gt; As someone with a bit of common sense, the answer to that question is overwhelmingly YES! 

And there it is people. This is why Trump is a legitimate candidate.  There is a subset of America that is so afraid and so bigoted they would sell out the principles of this country.

u/-corvo- we here rail against an AWB due to how arbitrary they are, how they don't prevent crime, how they are motivated by fear and feelings, and how it's a slippery slope that will probably lead to the banning of all guns.

Do you not see the parallels when you advocate for the persecution of a people not based on their actions, but their beliefs.

I mean there are people here who have said they would commit treason against the United States were a gun ban go into effect. I plead the 5th with regards to my feelings about that, but do you think those people should have their rights stripped just because they say they might take up arms against laws they feel are unjust? Or should the government wait until they actually commit seditious acts before trying to prosecute them?

We really need this motion to pass, because if we don't, the government will be able to sweep this whole thing under the rug like it never happened. They'll file a motion to dismiss, saying that everything has been settled and there will be no precedent set and no case law to use in the future. By having the motion for attorney's fees granted, the facts of the case will become a binding precedent that can be used in future 925(a) lawsuits. As it stands right now, there is no 925(a) case law out there because the government does everything they can to make the cases disappear.

I also won't vote for Clinton because I feel like she thinks she DESERVES to be President, that Obama stole '08 from her, and that now it's HER time.

What you said about the status quo is true, and that's why I don't like her. She's the same kinda person, one who claims to be tough on banks and reign in wallstreet, while taking hundreds of thousands of dollars form them, both in contributions and for speeches. 

Back at the beginning of the Campaign when Jeb Bush was being touted as the front runner I was really pissed that we had the possibility of going Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Bush. The US isn't a monarchy, but maybe it is, because now we have a real possibility of going Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Clinton, and who knows, maybe in 2020 or 2024 Jeb will get another shot.

I really wish Sanders had beat Clinton. He wasn't pro-2A by any means, but atleast he seemed different and I liked more of what he said than what I didn't like.

Trump, while immoral and ruthless, is a business man, and I think he saw a market that was ripe for exploitation in the subset of the GOP that was mad. Mad at the rich, mad at foreigners, mad at terrorists, mad at the government, mad at their predicament in life, just mad, and he spoke to those people. He turned their emotions into votes while the rest, and probably majority, of the GOP was split between Bush, Rubio, Carlson, Kasich, and Cruz. Now he's banking on the GOP taking that suppository because they hate Clinton, and the Dems staying home because Clinton isn't hugely popular with the left side of the spectrum.

So I'm staying out of it. I might vote for Johnson, I might write in someone, I'll vote in my state and local elections, but I won't vote for either of them.

And fuck ya'll who give me shit for not sucking that Trump dick. It doesn't mean I like guns or the 2A any less than you, it just means perhaps I have more diverse principles and am not a single issue voter.

And it's not because she's a bad rifle, far from it; she's rugged, well built, and has more money in her than any of my other rifles (though that's because of the EOtech).

And despite her being my first rifle, she's definitely the red-headed step child. [I have better looking AR's](https://imgur.com/a/lQbGk), [I have shorter AR's](http://imgur.com/4drJqCf), [I have longer AR's that are lighter, I have AR's that I shoot better](http://imgur.com/a/gDlL2), she just doesn't really do anything that something else I have does better.

However, she was my first, and you never forget your first. She still holds a special place in my heart, a permenant spot in my safe, and I'd reach for her in a heartbeat if I had to defend my home.

So I took her out on a date, stretched her legs and ran her around the block, and she still shoots great and loves me back.

618,"So you know how on range day, when you open your safe and start pulling out guns to take with you, there's always that one that gets passed over for one reason or another?

This is mine, a Rock River Arms CAR-4

And it's not because she's a bad rifle, far from it; she's rugged, well built, and has more money in her than any of my other rifles (though that's because of the EOtech).

And despite her being my first rifle, she's definitely the red-headed step child. [I have better looking AR's](https://imgur.com/a/lQbGk), [I have shorter AR's](http://imgur.com/4drJqCf), [I have longer AR's that are lighter, I have AR's that I shoot better](http://imgur.com/a/gDlL2), she just doesn't really do anything that something else I have does better.

However, she was my first, and you never forget your first. She still holds a special place in my heart, a permenant spot in my safe, and I'd reach for her in a heartbeat if I had to defend my home.

So I took her out on a date, stretched her legs and ran her around the block, and she still shoots great and loves me back.

 I've been actively working on this for the past 6 months or so. If I'm going for my most accurate I can put a mag of 9mm from my Glock 19 inside a 3 inch circle at 10 yards.

But, in the AR platform, for civilians, it doesn't do anything other than be quiet through a suppressor than the 5.56 doesn't do cheaper and with more availability.

Hell, out of a 10 inch barrel, out to 200 yards the rounds have similar trajectories.  Yeah, 300blk might hit harder, but if you're shooting paper that doesn't matter.

And then for HD that penetration is actually a liability.

So in the end, if you want 300blk go for it, but if you want something just to be different you're wasting money that could be spent on a different gun.",2016-09-12 17:07:37+00:00,d7jrjbh,5.0,t1_d7jn9bp,5565.0,ar15

Third, it really only applies to people doing more than just plinking, which, if you read OP's post, is about all he seems to want to do. I assumed he was going for a 10.5in barrel to match the 5.56 one he has. If he wants to go shorter, yes, 300BLK will perform better.

It just comes down to if you're not going to use 300BLK like it was designed for, suppressed, short barreled rifles, you're just adding alot of cost.

But that's why I suggested OP keep his current upper and buy a 300 blackout one, that way he can have his suppressed Blackout fun when he wants it and still enjoy the cheaper 5.56 ammo when he doesn't.

Did the same thing with the tiger stripe camo, though I think that one could be refined and done better. 

I'd recommend stencil adhesive now, keeps the stencil from moving around when you spray.

If you're using an exacto knife, simple designs with straight lines or gradual curves are best. Anything super detailed is going to be very hard.

However, if you have access to a laser cutter I see no reason why you couldn't make a design as complicated as you like.

One final tip, look for spray paint cans that have flat spray as opposed to a cone. Makes it much easier to do a sweeping, back and forth motion.

Also less is more, a couple steady swipes will do wonders.

696,"So you've been talking to me in another thread, but since you won't seem to ask me, but instead ask him why he carries, I'm going to give you my story. Please, read it, even if it doesn't change your mind, read it just so you have a better understanding of how I and many others think and feel about this.

So when I started to become a teenager, I started to get an interest in firearms. Yes, I'll admit it, it was fueled by media, namely the Resident Evil games and the Matrix, to name a few. I would read everything I could about firearms from whatever source I could find.

When I turned 18, I bought a shotgun. When I turned 21, I bought a handgun. I had always said I was going to get my concealed carry permit when I turned 21, but at the time I didn't because I was working in schools and those are Gun Free Zones. 

Guns kind of wained alittle in my mid twenties. I still liked them, but I didn't really do much. I'd go shoot maybe once a year, but that was it, and still no carry permit. However, during that time, I grew by leaps and bounds. I lost a ton of weight, I gained alot of self confidence, I got a full time job, and generally just became a much more mature and better person.

About 18 months ago I went shooting one day and remembered something I'd told myself years ago. When I got a full-time job and could afford it, I was going to get an AR15, so I did. When I bought that rifle, firearms went from a casual, and frankly, ignorance filled  occasional distraction to a time consuming hobby.

Now that I had one, I actually started to learn about the platform, how they work, why, why they are the way they are, how they differ from other firearms. I learned so, so much, both technically and physically. I went from not being able to hit the broad side of a barn to being an actual decent shot. 

Shooting became fun not because I was making cool noise, but because I was improving a skill. The fundamentals of trigger control, breath control, muscle control, sight control became a form of meditation. 

I can truly say that I love firearms, just like someone may love cars or trains or boats. The mechanics fascinate me and the actual act of shooting is relaxing.

However, I still didn't get my concealed carry permit.

Then November 13th, 2015, the November Paris Terror Attacks, happened. 

The woman who single handedly changed my life, a French citizen named Angelique, who motivated me to get my shit together and lose nearly 200 pounds by just being herself and paying me the time of day, was at the Bataclan Theater, at the *Eagles of Death Metal* concert.

For three AGONIZING days myself and her other friends from around the world tried desperately to find out if she had survived. Thankfully, she had survived with just a gunshot to the leg, but during those 72 hours of uncertainty I read ***EVERYTHING*** I could possibly find on what had happened at the Bataclan, dreading that I'd find her name in some article among the deceased victims.

I can tell you the exact account that made me make the decision to get my carry permit and start carrying a firearm every day.


As you know, the shooting wasn't over in an instant, it took 20 minutes, and was then followed by a standoff that lasted over 2 hours.

During that time, most likely shortly after the initial attack, a group of people found themselves in a break room and used a refrigerator to barricade the door. People died trying to get into that room, they died against that door, desperate for escape, for salvation.

Can you imagine? Can you put yourself in their shoes? Can you imagine the terror those on the outside felt? Can you IMAGINE the terror and GUILT those on the inside felt, hearing people being massacred on the other side of a thin door?

Look, thankfully, I know statistics. It is unlikely I will ever be the victim of a violent crime. It is much much much more unlikely I will ever be involved in a terror or mass shooting attack.

However, it is an undeniable, unassailable fact that there are people out there who want nothing other than to do others harm, whatever the motivation might be.

And that day, after reading that story, I made my decision. I will back down, I will retreat, I will hide, I am not a hero,

But, if I were faced with a person hellbent on doing me harm, I made the decision that I wanted something more than a refrigerator and my bare hands between me and death. So I carry a firearm with me every day, everywhere I am legally allowed to do so, and advocate for those restricted areas to be reduced and eliminated because criminals, murders, do not respect the law and they won't be dissuaded by it.

All of this is why I find it really insulting that your prejudices cause you to belittle ***MY*** choice, ***MY*** decision to exercise my **RIGHT** to defend myself from immediate, grievous bodily harm or death when that decision was so long in the making and took such a heavy emotional toll to come to.

If you don't feel like you could be responsible with a firearm, if you don't feel like you could take a life if you were forced to choose between yourself, a loved one, or an innocent and someone intent on doing them grave bodily harm or killing them, then by all means, go about your life. I don't belittle you for that choice, it is one every person has the right to make. But please, please, don't advocate for taking that choice away from *me* as well.

698,"Ah, you're referring to ""deescalation"" Yes, that's something I take to heart. I don't want to shoot someone over an argument, I don't want to shoot someone over some offense, real or imagined. I will back down, I will walk, or run, away. But if you're saying every conflict can be resolved with words, you're out of your mind.

The fact of the matter is, there are people out there bent on doing harm, if I go through life never being on the receiving end of that harm, I will die a happy man. I don't want to shoot anyone, period. However, I also made the choice that, if it came down to it, I would do whatever it took to defend myself, or an innocent, from immediate, grievous bodily harm or death.

Getting back to the matter at hand, why do you think that my decision to carry a firearm makes me ""paranoid"" and leads you to believe that I have ""low self-esteem""?",2016-09-10 02:19:46+00:00,d7gi104,10.0,t1_d7ggd6t,2868.0,pokemongo

Carrying at work is going to be up to you, I don't know if your state has No-Guns signs with force of law, or if at worst you're gonna get fired if outed, but ultimately you need to be aware of the possible consequences and decide if you can accept them should they arise.

A small pocket pistol in a discreet holster in your pocket and no one should ever know unless you open your mouth or take it out to play with it, two things you shouldn't do.

There is also deep concealment,  think a holster that goes over your other gun *nudge nudge wink wink*. These are much harder to draw from but also much much harder to be outed with.

Then I had an epiphany.  These things are made to be humped by grunts into war. You think ammo doesn't get banged around in the back of a Humvee or on a rig?

My rule of thumb is if the case isn't cracked, if the round is straight, and it feeds, I'll shoot it.  The pressure will expand the brass to the chamber and knock the ding out.

The only round I've tossed was one where the case shoulder had been sheered by something, picture it was ground down at an angle.

Also, American Eagle is made by Federal, which is like the Gold Standard company for 5.56mm. It doesn't look pretty, but I've shot thousands of rounds of it and it's been perfect.

That being said, you should shoot XM193 instead of Xm855 because it's cheaper plinking ammo.  If you're going for extreme accuracy you want match ammo anyway. ",2016-09-06 19:30:47+00:00,d7bugic,1.0,t3_51eudi,26964.0,ar15

There's two forms of feed ramps. Regular feed ramps found on M16 rifles, and M4 feed ramps found on M4 carbines.

M16 feed ramps are just milled into the barrel extension/chamber. However, when they were developing the M4, they found that, because it cycled so much faster due to its shorter gas system and shorter/lighter buffer (at the point), that the rounds needed a little more guidance.

M4 feed ramps are milled down into the receiver and link up to the feed ramps in the barrel extension.

It looks like you have M4 feed ramps on your barrel extension, but no cuts in the receiver. 

However, money is still on the magazine being at fault, then short stroking, and then finally the feed ramps.

Typically, if it were the feed ramps, you'd just get the tip of the bullet stuck instead of riding over the top of the round.

First, you don't *have* to stick your penis in her vagina. If this was the girl who got hit by the car, (and if it's not, then maybe you got a new fetish) then it sounds like you guys have been together for atleast a little while now.

Go by the assumption that there will be sexytimes in the future and just do what you can now.

Have an open conversation with her. See what she's into, what works for you, and what she's physically capable of doing while she heals.

Don't totally discount mutual masturbation, it's real hot to be cuddled up next to your SO and both be going to town on each other's jibblies.

But then there's the more nuanced parts like who sets the standards? Is the teacher going to present the firearm as a positive, negative, or (correctly, in my opinion) as neutral because that's what it is.

That gets back to what I said in another post and why many 2A advocates are against mandatory gun-safety classes before you are allowed to *purchase* a firearm.

The Second Amendment puts the onus on the government to prove that you cannot abide by the rules of society (IE: not commit a crime with a gun), it doesn't make YOU prove to the government that you should be *allowed* to own a gun. You already have that right and it's up to the government to give you due process to strip it.

The examples are:

* Cold medicine used to make methamphetamines. The fact you just have to give your birth date, or at most flash your ID to buy a package is ignored.

* Alcohol, which can be bought in most any store equipped with a cooler in the vast majority of the states.  Special note to this one
 &gt; ""It is one of the hardest things for anyone under the age of 21 to get."" 

That made me chuckle.


* A phone contract that costs hundreds of dollars a month because you have to get a credit check. Well of course that's harder, you can buy quality guns for a $200 one time fee. Also, I can go to walmart and buy a $10 tracfone. The guy ALSO says you actually can get one without a credit check, but you have to put down $500 as a deposit. My Glock 19 cost me $560 so I guess that was harder.

* A living creature being adopted out by the ASPCA. I can go a mile down the road and buy a puppy from the Amish for $20, no questions asked.

* A fishing/hunting permit, because fuck trying to conserve the natural resources, we're trying to make a political point here. Plus, I don't have to provide my social Security number when I get a hunting or fishing license in my state.

Here's a few things to check out.

There should be a [forge mark](http://i40.tinypic.com/oaosrb.jpg) just past the rear sight assembly on one side of the handle. The mark varies by the forge, obviously, but it should be there.

Also look at the elevation drum below the rear sight. Is it marked 3/6, does it rotate with purpose? Cheap ones tend to just be a screw and the numbers on the drum don't really mean anything while real ones correspond to distances.

If you unscrew the knobs, do they come all the way off? Real ones don't, they're captured so you don't lose them in warzones.

If you flip up the peep sight, does it say 0 - 2 on the larger aperture?

Did you buy the rifle new? What make and model?

Rifle, which is used with Rifle Length fixed stocks, which are longer, meaning longer springs, which take up more of the energy and creating lower recoil.

Then there's Carbine, for when you use a short fixed or an adjustable stock. Shorter, more recoil, but allows that shorter OAL when collapsed. 

You can use either on any length gas system.

Now a heavier buffer in a carbine sized buffer will reduce the recoil more than a standard buffer. I see no reason why it won't work in your rifle.

1483,"Ah see. Why the hell didn't you say this earlier?  What you're talking about is a ""universal background check"" (UBC) law, which, while contentious, is different from liscensing or a registry.


Take out all your references to the internet and gun shows because they don't matter, it boils down to private sales.

Now, the reason we don't have a UBC is technically the federal government can only regulate interstate things, which is why out of state transfers require an FFL to go through, but selling a gun to your neighbor does not.

Really the only way to do so would require all sales to go through FFls, (PA does this with handguns btw).  Having private citizens fill out forms containing all personal information and then retaining them for even a year wouldn't work and could see people jailed for clerical errors.

However, that just flips people over to the ""it was stolen"" defence, which again puts the onus on law enforcement to prove it wasn't.

I mean dude, what can be codified into law that would prevent anything? That's not the point of a law.  A law doesn't prevent anything, it just lays out punishment after the fact.

Have you actually looked into state and federal firearms law? Do you know the restrictions on such? Do you know what constitutes a NFA Restricted Item? How guns can be transferred? What weapons can be sold across state lines and which can't? What constitutes a prohibited person? What the NICS is?  What a shotgun, pistol, rifle is in the eyes of federal law? What ITAR is?

1486,"&gt; I just find it so bizarre not to work on helping correct the problems of the illegal gun market at all because you're worried the government will round up all the guns.

I don't see a problem though. There are laws on the books that deal with it and the onus is on the state to prove that you broke them.

Making a straw purchase is a federal crime. Knowingly allowing a prohibited person to possess your firearm is a federal crime. Yeah, people can go ""gun was stolen"" but that's the same for any crime, and I don't feel like we should make law enforcement's job easier at the expense of people's privacy, which is what a total registry and licensing would do.

And you and I are just mincing words. Yes, I will admit, licensing and registry doesn't *inherently* lead to confiscation; but you also have to admit there people in power, either through due to fear, mistrust of the public, or yes, tyrannical desires, who do not want the public to have certain types or even *any* firearm. 

And the fact that those people exist are why the ""slippery slope"" argument is made because, as you readily admit, it is much easier to build on top of existing legislation than to just do something all at once.

&gt;  I DO think that high capacity mags aren't needed. You're right to hunt a deer isn't in the constitution. You're right to defend yourself with a firearm is. 10 bullets preserve that right.

I would disagree, which is why I carry thirty on me daily.  And I kinda resent the idea that ""no one needs more than 10 bullets"" when there are many cases when yeah, someone did. The ""no one needs more than 10 bullets"" argument implies that, if you disagree, you are up to something nefarious.

1497,"It's not a fallacy if it has a documented example.

Hell, there's two, California and Massachusetts.

California has the aforementioned 10+ round mag ban, then all grandfathered mags have to be surrendered.

It also has the bullet button compromise. Semi-auto rifles with banned features used to be compliant if their mags could only be removed through the use of a tool. Fast forward to last month, now that's not good enough. Now the action of the weapon has to be disassembled. Which led to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XedaFH6pC1o) How long before that's deemed unacceptable, despite being in total compliance with the law today?

Then look at MASS. They too banned most detachable mag fed semi-autos based on features, leading to rifles like [this](http://www.windhamweaponry.com/images/rifles/hiresjpg/R16M4FTT-CF1-NYTHD-R.jpg) which were in total compliance with the law until the attorney general decided that wasn't good enough and expanded the definitions of the law without the state assembly.

I can point to another that was overturned. [NY State's SAFE Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NY_SAFE_Act#Provisions), which in its inception reduced NY's 10 round mag limit to ones that could hold only7 rounds because (""No one needs 10 bullets to kill a deer..."")[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKXJ6VTlAM] *(Note: Wish I could have found a better source, but there it is from Gov. Cuomo's own mouth.)* 

AND the SAFE ACT again made all grandfathered 10+ round mags illegal and subject to forfeiture or sale one year form the enactment.


Now look, if you think mag fed semi-autos should be banned, well, I doubt there's anything I can say that would change your mind, though if you have any questions, feel free to ask. However, perhaps these examples will show you why many gun owners scream ""slippery slope"" when ""Common sense"" ^^To ^^Who? legislation is proposed.

1534,"&gt;The ATF procedure for measuring barrel length is to measure from the closed bolt (or breech-face) to
the furthermost end of the barrel or permanently attached muzzle device. Permanent methods of
attachment include full-fusion gas or electric steel-seam welding, high-temperature (1100°F) silver
soldering, or blind pinning with the pin head welded over. Barrels are measured by inserting a dowel rod
into the barrel until the rod stops against the bolt or breech-face. The rod is then marked at the
furthermost end of the barrel or permanently attached muzzle device, withdrawn from the barrel, and
measured.

1573,"Sigh, and you, sir, obviously don't realize that what you think something is and what the law says it is are two vastly different things. 

Look at the [Mossberg 500 # 50450](http://www.mossberg.com/product/500-tactical-6-shot-50450/)

Yes, it's marketed as a shotgun by Mossberg, but according to Federal Law, a shotgun has to be intended to be fired from the shoulder.

Looking at that gun, there is no way in hell you can say that it is intended to be fired from the shoulder. You would break your collar bone.

So why isn't it a sawed off shotgun?

Because a short-barreled shotgun, by the Federal Law definition, a short-barreled shotgun has to have a barrel under 18 inches in length OR be under 26 inches in length.

What do you know, the Mossberg 500 Tactical 6 shot #50450 has a barrel length of 18.5 inches and a length of 27 inches.

Also federal law defines a pistol as:

&gt; The term “Pistol” means a weapon originally designed, made, and intended to fire a projectile (bullet) from one or more barrels when held in one hand, and having:

&gt; * a chamber(s) as an integral part(s) of, or permanently aligned with, the bore(s);

&gt; * and a short stock designed to be gripped by one hand at an angle to and extending below the line of the bore(s).

Since that shotgun is designed to be fired with two hands, it doesn't qualify as a pistol.

So what is it? Well, it's a ""firearm"" which is [defined as](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921)

&gt; (3) The term “firearm” means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; 

because it fires a projectile by action of an explosive and doesn't meet the qualifications to be anything else.

Not enough for you? Here's from the ATF themselves **PDF WARNING** https://www.atf.gov/file/56446/download 

I direct you to the section titled **""Pistol Grips and Shotguns""** which states, and I quote,

&gt; Certain commercially produced firearms do not fall within
the definition of shotgun under the GCA even though
they utilize a shotgun shell for ammunition. For example,
firearms that come equipped with a pistol grip in place of
the buttstock are not shotguns as defined by the GCA.

&gt; A firearm with a pistol grip in lieu of the shoulder stock is
not designed to be fired from the shoulder and, therefore,
is not a shotgun. Since it is a firearm “other than a rifle or
shotgun,” the purchaser must be 21 years of age or older.
Additionally, interstate controls apply. The licensee and
transferee must be residents of the same State.

&gt; Other questions raised pertain to entries made in the
licensee’s required records with respect to firearm “type.”
These entries should indicate the firearm type as “pistol grip
firearm.”

[OHHHHHHHHHH YEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/591/926/700.jpg) it feels good to be right.

Here is some additional reading. **PDF WARNING** [How the ATF Classifies Firearms](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/atf-national-firearms-act-handbook-chapter-2/download)

1578,"Actually no, it doesn't.

What you're referring to is the definition of a ""Short-barreled shotgun""
which according to 18 U.S. Code § 921 - Definitions is:

&gt; 6) The term “short-barreled shotgun” means a shotgun having one or more barrels less than eighteen inches in length and any weapon made from a shotgun (whether by alteration, modification or otherwise) if such a weapon as modified has an overall length of less than twenty-six inches.

Notice how it says ""The term 'short-barreled shotgun' means a ***shotgun*** having one...""

Well, a shotgun is defined as:

&gt; (5) The term “shotgun” means a weapon designed or redesigned, made or remade, **and intended to be fired from the shoulder** and designed or redesigned and made or remade to use the energy of an explosive to fire through a smooth bore either a number of ball shot or a single projectile for each single pull of the trigger.


Since Sig braces aren't intended to be shoulder, and doing so would be in violation of the ATF's ruling, it can't be a shotgun.

The pictured gun never had a stock on it, so it was never a shotgun, and therefore doesn't fall under those definitions.

1579,"So look, might get shit for saying this but I'm going to say it anyway.

You guys need to get off your asses and take control of your body in addition to your Rights.

Believe me OP, I know how hard it is. At my max I was 385 pounds and when I started actively losing weight I was 373. I was huge, I was a god damn land whale, I was on a short road to an early death.

And in one day I changed my life. I started eating a reasonable diet, I started exercising, and the weight just fell off me.

You don't have to do some 30 day water only fast because I can tell you, that shit wont work. You need to make changes that you can actually stick to.

Even cutting down to the recommended 2000 calories/day, which I can guarantee you're way over, and just going for a walk an hour a day is a great way to start and something you can actually stick to and improve on.

You don't have to give up everything, or really anything, you just have to manage it. Have a 8oz soda instead of a 2-liter, a single burger instead of a double, two slices of pizza instead of a whole one, one cookie instead of 6. If I had plans to go out at night, I'd eat a salad or something for lunch.

If you are honest with yourself, stick with it, and don't give up, the weight will come off whether you're 16 or 60.

1695,"1. That sort of thing happens, buy is rare and isolated.

Usually what happens is some moron will brandish a gun when he shouldn't have, realized he fucked up, and then be arrested shortly there after.

I've never heard of a case where someone thought an attack was happening and shot a bunch of people.

In this country where the majority of it is ""Not a prohibited person? Buy anything legally allowed"" accidents do happen, suicides do happen, and sometimes people use a gun when they are not covered by the law.

Thos of us against gun control think that this is a necessary evil, one we can't prevent without denying many more people their rights. You can't punish people before they act, so while there may be someone who maybe shouldn't have s gun, until they demonstrate that in a legal s3nse then they are free to purchaee whatever.


2.  Thia varies by state.  Where I am in PA I can be too drunk to drive and still carry a gun.  In ohio I can be arrested for having a sip of beer and carrying a gun.  Personally I'm in favor of the former over the latter, and would be ok with the rules of DUI (IE .08bac) applying to the carrying of a firearm in public.

But ultimately the law is something that applies after the fact, it doesn't prevent someone from drinking and carrying a firearm.

Personally, I have had drinks with dinner and been fine, had drinks socially and been fine, and had times when I've locked my gun up because I felt I was becoming too intoxicated.  It's a personal responsibility thing.",2016-07-15 22:53:16+00:00,d5dxh0c,1.0,t3_4t1rcp,1200.0,guns

I carry a gun daily, does it make me feel safer.  I'm sitting here at the vet's office really thinking about this and the answer is ~~no~~

~~The only thing that changed about me when I decided to carry is that...~~

Wait, the answer is yes, but not in the way you think.  Having the actual firearm makes me feel more prepared, but what makes me feel safer is how it changed my attitude.

I don't ever want to shoot someone. I don't want to kill someone. Will I to defend myself from grievous bodily harm, yes, but I don't want to.

So I avoid confrontation. Where once I would have argued, now I leave.  Where once I would have gotten mad, I chill.  I'm more aware, I avoid sketchy looking situations and take in my surroundings more.

Hell, it's made me a better witness, something I got to demonstrate recently.


Also, if this is your video, you're making some huge fucking generalizations.

I own several ARs, yes, they may be copies of something designed for war (like all firearms were) but that doesn't mean I ""feel"" like going to war.

God, war is awful. I never want to go and I honestly want to stop sending troops to fight these ""little"" wars that turn into 5-10-hell we're at year 15 of Afghanistan.  And that doesn't even account for the emotional trauma and civilian casualties.

War is hell but a semi-auto rifle, along with any gun, is just a tool.  Tools can be used for good and for bad, doesn't mean the tool is evil.

Here's a picture. http://s85.photobucket.com/user/AR15_Fanatic/media/AR15/a2stock.jpg.html

Really all the spacer does is give a place to screw the back of the stock into, otherwise the bolt would poke into the buffer tube and possibly impact the buffer.

So it's not the stock's fault, you're fucking up somehow, most likely by babying the charging handle instead of cranking it like you haven't jerked off in three months.

I don't see why this is a negative thing. Yeah, it's a semi-auto rifle. It's designed to be rugged and accurate and easy to use. It's just the modernization of the same thing humanity's been using for the last 100 years.

The Springfield 1903 was built for the express purpose of killing humans, the M1 Garand was built for the express purpose of killing humans.

Your pistols were designed with the express purpose of killing humans,

and your hunting rifle, while designed to kill game, can just as easily kill a human.

Registry is more to do with confiscation, and for that I point to California.  Before this new set of laws you could have a bullet button, now you can't but old rifles are grandfathered if you register them.

However, mags with capacity over 30 rounds USED to be grandfathered too.  Now they are banned en-blanc. You will have to turn them in.

1869,"&gt; Guns are not an equalizer all the time. If that was the case then everyone who ever had a gun would be alive. 

Equal doesn't mean better. A gun is not a force field. It merely gives you a chance, a better chance than just your fists or a knife, because it takes considerably much less skill or strength to use and come out unscathed than a hand-to-hand scenario.

Put a 110 pound woman and a 250 pound man, both with no training at all, and tell them to fist fight each other and I'd take the man every time.

Give the woman a gun and, while she might not win every time, she has a much better chance.

Give them both guns and it drops to 50/50, and then training comes into play.

And yeah, I'm not gonna argue with you. A gun is a tool to kill. Anyone who argues otherwise is just splitting hairs. The difference is when a citizen uses the gun justifiably, in defense of themselves or others, it becomes a life saver.

I really dislike it when people like /u/Gator_Engr and yourself use huge hyperboles to argue their points, so I'm going to talk about a very real example to me.

Here goes:

I have always enjoyed firearms. Probably the earliest memory I can pin down involving guns is Resident Evil. I was really interested in the weapons of the STARS characters, and the interest grew from there.

I read as much as I could about them, and at 18 I bought my first gun, a pump action shotgun, and my first handgun at 21, a sub-compact 9mm. 

I had grown up as a conservative, listening to Rush Limbaugh, voting for bush, spouting the same statistics and rhetoric I'm sure you've heard countless times.

I had always said I was going to buy an AR, going to get my concealed carry permit as soon as I could. But a combination of money and the career I was pursuing at the time I didn't. I had my shotgun and my handgun, and both sat in their cases 99.9% of the time.

Long about.. what, 2012 was it, I had a change of heart. When the Tea Party movement sprung up I took a look at these people who I had supported in my casual ""If he's got an R next to his name, I vote for him"" way and I was rather appalled. It made me re-examine what I believed in and I had a near 100% shift to the left.

I just typed a bunch of stuff that basically sums up to me saying I'm a rather flaming liberal now, except in one area.

It was just last year when I finally had the funds to take my casual interest in firearms and make it my hobby. Since then I have bought several guns and visit the range several times a month because it is something I enjoy mightily. The Ar-15, it's design, its mechanisms, the feel of it in my hands and working on my ability to use it accurately, safely, and effectively just brings me as much pleasure as painting or writing or working on a car or tending a garden does for someone else.

Still, I hadn't gotten my concealed carry permit. Then the Paris shootings happened.

A friend of mine who has had a greater impact on my life than anyone other than my parents was in the Bataclan Theater. For three excruciating, nerve wracking days we had no idea what happened to her and I read EVERYTHING I could get my hands on about that incident, dreading that I would read her name amongst the dead.

It was reading about people hiding in the theater and hearing and seeing people be murdered. People who died outside doors trying to get in while other people cowered behind their makeshift barricades, hoping the gunmen wouldn't.

The man who hid under bodies, literally laying in the pools of cooling blood and limbs to survive. And I put myself in their shoes.

Do I fear being in a mass shooting, terror attack, or the victim of a violent crime? No, statistically I'll never experience any of those things. But it also made me think.

I decided that I would try to save my own life. That if I was in a situation like that, that I wanted something else between me and a madman besides a flimsy door and a couch propped against it.

Do I think I'm a hero? No. Against three men armed with automatic rifles, do I think I stand a chance? Not really. But carrying a gun means I have more of a chance than someone who doesn't.

I'll still run, I'll still hide, but I also know that if I were faced with an attacker trying to kill me I at least have a better tool than a knife, a stapler, or my fists to defend myself and the people around me. Will I succeed? Maybe not, if the good guys always won the world would be great, but at least I'll die trying to do something, instead of cowering and hoping for the authorities to save me.

I pray to God I never have to find out how I'd fare in a situation like that.

But yes, despite being a liberal almost everywhere else, you can pry my guns from my cold, dead hands.

My friend survived, by the way. Shot in her leg, but she's physically recovered and is working on the mental part.

90% of the posts lately have been political, new people aaking what to buy, or new people troubleshooting.

Which is all fine and dandy, I welcome all you new AR owners, even if you don't find the carry handle as sexy as I do.

But I want to get back to what this sub is about, our love of one of the greatest rifles ever designed, the AR-15.

Here we have my A4gery as close to a jungle as I hope she ever gets.

I've had her for about, oh, 8 months now, and much to the sadness of my first AR (a RRA Car-4) she is my favorite.

There is just something about that stock look; the A2 stock, the standard handguards, the A2 flash hider, and of course  the detachable carry that just begs to be fondled that draws me in.

During [Operation: Git Gud](https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/4in65t/operation_git_gud_one_mans_journey_from_shit_to/) I've  begun to learn her quirks.  How 20 round mags don't like to seat on a closed bolt without a good smack, or how she likes her windage 3 ticks to the right.

Hell, you don't need a license to buy or drive a car on private land/roads.  It's when you take it out into the public that you do.

Do you see my point?

You also have to understand that the damn near zealotry some people demonstrate with regard to gun laws is because they've seen their rights chipped away over time.

It was just 10 years ago when the 94 AWB was in effect. 30 years ago machinegun registry was closed.  California demonstrates that the slippery slope is real, and I, for one, would be a little upset if the inanimate objects I enjoy and collect were suddenly rendered illegal contraband because of fear, ignorance, or a disarmament agenda.

2014,"Free societies are not safe, and safe societies are not free.

In our country, you're not supposed to be able to deny people their rights until they have demonstrated that they cannot operate according to society's rules.

Mateen had been interviewed and investigated multiple times over several years and the authorities obviously didn't find anything to charge him with. Therefore, he still had his rights, and unfortunately he committed a heinous act. 

I honestly see the people who died as martyrs who gave their life in the defense of due process. 

Having a right to privacy, having a right to due process, having a right to a presumed innocence, having a right to not incriminate yourself, all of these things mean that sometimes bad men are able to commit bad acts.

Really, we lost sight of that in a big way post 9/11. The PATRIOT act and all the things related to it are a huge blight on what this country is supposed to be about. Reductions in civil liberties allowed to stand because people are afraid.

&gt; Like, how do you watch the bodies pile up and then just turn around and pretend there isn't a clear problem back there? I just can't understand that mindset, my friend. I get it, ""2nd amendment"", how does that make it any better though?

I don't pretend there's not a problem. It's a problem that has existed since man first killed another man in cold blood. Some people just want to watch the world burn, but I am not willing to strip away something from hundreds of millions of law abiding citizens because a fraction of one percent of people commit crimes with them.

Also, since further down you talk about the Amendments to the Constitution, I'd like to talk about that too.

It seems to me that you don't really grasp just what it takes to amend the Constitution of the United States. 

Here's a quote from Wikipedia:

&gt; Article Five of the United States Constitution describes the process whereby the Constitution, the nation's frame of government, may be altered. Altering the Constitution consists of proposing an amendment or amendments and subsequent ratification. Amendments may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a convention of states called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures.[1] To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must be ratified by either—as determined by Congress—the legislatures of three-fourths of the states or State ratifying conventions in three-fourths of the states. The vote of each state (to either ratify or reject a proposed amendment) carries equal weight, regardless of a state’s population or length of time in the Union.

So basically, 75% of the US population has to agree to change the Constitution. I can tell you that 75% of the US does not agree with a total Australian style ban on firearms.

And beyond that, what is proposed is a ban on semi-automatic firearms, no if and or buts about it. And that is something totally unacceptable to a vast majority of the gun owning community.

I mean look at [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L4c6oGsHioo/UREfgeR2qSI/AAAAAAAAAHk/GoTTru1DdDY/s1600/AR-15+&amp;+Mini-14.png)

During the 94 AWB the top was banned, the bottom was not, for arbitrary reasons built on ignorance and fear. They can accept the same size magazines, fire the same type of ammunition, and operate in a very similar way.

[Here](http://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c394/PcItalian/mini-14-deluxelimited_zps4af906e3.jpg) is an even better way to draw the comparison.

2078,"You say that but did you actually read the article you listed.

Here's Kennedy's testimony on what happened:

&gt; Kennedy, Aug. 19, 2004: I got on the watch list last April. I was taking a plane to Boston and I get out to the USAIR and I come up to the counter and I said I want my ticket.

&gt;They said we can’t give it to you. I say, well, wait a minute, here is a Visa. There must have been a mix-up. And the person behind the gate said, “I can’t sell it to you. You can’t buy a ticket to go on the airline to Boston.” I said well, why not. We just — we can’t tell you. Well, I said, let me talk to the supervisor on that. This is at five of seven. The plane is about to leave and finally, the supervisor said okay.

&gt; And I thought it was a mix-up in my office, which it wasn’t. And I got to Boston and said there’s been a mix-up on this thing to Boston. What in the world has ever happened? Is this what happened? Tried to get on the plane back to Washington. You can’t get on the plane. I went up to the desk. I said I’ve been getting on this plane, you know, for 42 years and why can’t I get on the plane back to Boston — back to Washington. And they said you can’t get on the plane back to Washington.

&gt; So my administrative assistant talked to the Department of Homeland Security and they said there’s some mistake. It happened three more times and finally Secretary Ridge called to apologize on it. It happened even after he called to apologize because they couldn’t — my name was on the list at the airports and with the airlines and the Homeland Security. He couldn’t get my name off the list for a period of weeks.

&gt; Now, if they had that kind of difficulty for a member of Congress, they’d have it — my office has a number of instances where we’ve had the leader of a distinguished medical school in New England and the list goes on. How in the world are average Americans who are going to get caught up in this kind of thing, how are they going to be able to get treated fairly and not have their rights abused?

So a guy who has been a US Senator for DECADES had to call around Washington at 7pm to get this cleared up because his name happened to be T. Kennedy. 

As Kennedy says, how is a normal person who has the same name as someone on that list supposed to navigate that system?  

And for Yusuf Islam, 

&gt; Department of Homeland Security said Islam was put on the watch list “because of concerns about activities that *could potentially* be *related* to terrorism.”

Which translates to ""Ehhh, we THINK he might have done something that maybe has some connection to terrorism, but we're not sure."" 

It's speculated he gave money to charities that had terrorist connections. It doesn't say that those charities directly supported terrorism. It doesn't say Yusuf Islam knew about these connections. It doesn't say if he was only donating to terrorism connected charities, or if maybe he made a bunch of different donations to a bunch of different charities. 

The point is, sir, that a list like this TOTALLY circumvents due process, the very idea that you are innocent until proven guilty. Why are we arming supposedly innocent people, indeed, people who just happen to share a similar name to another person, instead of actually following due process?

If this doesn't make you want to scream and rip your hair out, either you're willfully ignorant, or are so afraid you're willing to sell out the very foundation of this country for a little security theater.",2016-06-18 05:40:25+00:00,d4e0m21,6.0,t1_d4dxqu4,6643.0,news

They also make metal gas block height front sights, but they're more expensive, will run you about $100.

Considering any rear sight you use will be made to be level with the A-frame FSB, I'd really suggest just getting whatever rear you want and trying it out before you change it.

I find it funny you lambaste and exalt due process in the same post.

All the FBI has to do is charge someone with a crime that could send someone to prison for a year and they become a person prohibited from buying a gun.

But really, how it's supposed to operate in this country is UNTIL you're charged you're assumed to have done nothing wrong. It doesn't matter what you're being investigated for, it matters what you're charged with and it matters what you are convicted of.

And in this case the FBI actually interviewed the guy and didn't find anything to charge him with. How long should he lose his rights for?

Your TSA analogy doesn't hold water because, theoretically, you are voluntarily submitting to be searched in order to board an aircraft, something you could chose not to do. And even before 9/11 and the TSA, airports would make you submit to a search as a condition for boarding a plane.


Look man, free societies aren't safe and safe societies aren't free.

* There's no way to know until you are stopped from boarding a plane.

* It is extremely hard to get off of said list

and you think it's a good idea to extend that to a constitutionally guaranteed right? A right enumerated between the freedom of speech, religion, press and assembly, and the freedom to be secure in your own home and property; the Amendment that guarantees due process.

It should chill you to the bone to think that, just because you are put on a list, a right in the Constitution can be stripped from you.

Add taking leisurely strolls with your wife and child, ones where you can get comfortable carrying on your body while staying around your neighborhood, and the pounds will start melting away.

2341,"**TL;DR** *Stores don't want your merchandise, they want money. Sell your stuff on the internet*

People selling things to retail stores are taking a hit on what they get so they get the cash NOW, and I don't understand why people complain about it.

Let's say I have a Glock 19 I bought for $550. Popular pistol, reliable, hard to mess up, will run for ever. I can sell it used for $400 every day, might get $450 if I wait and $500 if the market is tight at the moment. LGS has a Glock 43 for $625 that I'd like to trade up for.

Now, the LGS doesn't want your gun, they want your cash money because they got bills to pay and vacation they're saving for. You'll be lucky if the LGS pays you $400 for your basically NiB Glock 19 because, and here's the key, they are incurring all the time and effort it'll take to turn that pistol into money. They are more likely to offer you $250 and price it at $400 to get that quick turnaround because they have something YOU want and you are offering something that only has a value in the future.

You're basically getting a cash advance on a consignment sale.

* When not a panic, atleast 75% of what you paid for it.

* Furniture you added has, at most, 10% of its retail value. You're better off putting stock furniture back on and selling the stuff you added separately.

* Same goes for optics.

* Any tuning done by anyone who isn't famous is worth zero and may even decrease value.

* Unless there's visible wear on major components, round count doesn't really matter unless it's 5000 plus, and then only marginally until you get to the point where things need replaced.

If you don't need the money right now OP, hang onto it for a couple months. Then you might get what you paid for it, or even more.

2516,"I am not a lawyer, but you're actually ok doing what you're doing. The law says in ""Exceptions"" to ""Firearms not to be carried without a lisence"":

&gt; (4)  Any persons engaged in target shooting with a firearm, if such persons are at or are going to or from their places of assembly or target practice and if, while going to or from their places of assembly or target practice, the firearm is not loaded.

However, farther down, it says:

&gt; § 6108.  Carrying firearms on public streets or public property in Philadelphia.

&gt;No person shall carry a firearm, rifle or shotgun at any time upon the public streets or upon any public property in a city of the first class unless:

&gt;(1)  such person is licensed to carry a firearm; or

&gt;(2)  such person is exempt from licensing under section 6106(b) 
of this title (relating to firearms not to be carried without a license).

Subsection (b) is the list of exceptions, of which #4 is one.

To make sure, let's see what the state defines as ""Unloaded"":

Under ""Definitions"" it states:

&gt; ""Loaded.""  A firearm is loaded if the firing chamber, the nondetachable magazine or, in the case of a revolver, any of the chambers of the cylinder contain ammunition capable of being fired. In the case of a firearm which utilizes a detachable magazine, the term shall mean a magazine suitable for use in said firearm which magazine contains such ammunition and has been inserted in the firearm or is in the same container or, where the container has multiple compartments, the same compartment thereof as the firearm. If the magazine is inserted into a pouch, holder, holster or other protective device that provides for a complete and secure enclosure of the ammunition, then the pouch, holder, holster or other protective device shall be deemed to be a separate compartment.

So in my lay-person interpretation, you're gold.

You back down from every fight, cow-tow to every argument, walk away from every insult because you know that you will kill a person if the situation escalates.

Everything that happens before the gun comes out is the attacker's warning, and once the gun comes out, you kill the threat.

But ah, here's the rub, the attacker can suddenly stop being a threat. 

Just because you draw your gun doesn't mean you're obligated to kill the person. If they suddenly realize that they really didn't want this fight and run, then no, you don't have to kill them, and I like to think that I'd have the wherewithal stop.

* 20in barrel that is not ""pencil""

* A-frame gas block

* A2 flash hider

* Rifle Length USGI handguards

* Mil-spec lower with whatever LPK and trigger you want.

* A2 full length rifle stock

* A2 style grip

Building one yourself will let you pick whatever kind of barrel you want, but pinning the front sight is a PITA and may require a gunsmith.

Buying a complete upper is easier, more expensive, and your barrel choice is limited.

If you want an A4gery, just get a flat top upper, an f-marked gas block, and a USGI surplus carry handle.

People who shoot professionally could probably do it on a stationary target, but soldiers, police officers, or even civilians would be hard pressed to shoot a moving target's limbs. Hell, some are hard pressed to hit them at all.

It's not like the movies. If you're lucky, you've got a few seconds to line up the shot, but people don't always go down in one shot. In the moment, it can be hard to tell if you've even hit the person, which is why you're trained to empty the magazine into an assailant. 

Guns are not wounding tools, they are weapons to kill. You shouldn't use them to wound, you should use them as a last resort to lawfully defend yourself and your family.

I conceal carry, and, God, if you're listening, I pray that I am never forced to draw my gun against someone.

It was gorgeous. 74 degrees out, very little breeze, very few clouds, and only a few shooters, mostly at the handgun ranges. For a few hours I was the only one doing a rifle.

A 16 inch carbine was my first rifle, and I love her dolled up ass, but the A4gery is my favorite. Simple, but effective, and oh so fun.

The last shot was of the last 3 rounds of the day. After doing a mix of 50, 75, and 100 yard shooting, I decided to just see if I could hit paper at 300 yards from the bench with irons.

The slightly lighter shade of pixels on the bunker to the right is the target, and I did not hit paper.

However, I plan to make a day of dialing the elevation in. I know she won't shoot MOA at that distance, but I'd like to be able to hit Minute of Man from prone/the bench.",2016-04-26 01:07:03+00:00,d2hbrib,1.0,t3_4ggg26,349.0,guns

&gt; Your first job is NOT to get home. Your first job is to uphold the law. That means not violating it yourself. You are not above the law.

This, while aggressive, actually seems pretty straight forward. In his opinion you should be first and foremost worried about enforcing the law and doing your duty, even if that means you have to sacrifice yourself, than to go home to your family.

Now, one can argue that really, if you were following the law the only time you wouldn't make it home anyway would be in a situation where you *would* be in the right to do whatever is necessary to make it home; it's kind of a catch 22.  

However, the idea that you would rather go home than enforce the law, which is what doing anything to make it home implies, rubs many people the wrong way. Also, I think the fact you are so readily admit this doesn't help.

&gt; That thin blue line crap is despicable. It's an excuse for cops to support each other for acting above the law.

I think this is in reference to your username, which makes reference to the ""Thin Blue Line"". The TBL is often seen as cops always backing other cops, even if they are not correct or acting lawfully. Whether this is true is arguable, but I don't see how you can deny that there are instances where police officers either do not intervene when their colleges are overstepping their bounds or actively assist them in doing so, and unfortunately that breeds an aura of mistrust within the citizenry towards law enforcement.

&gt; Anyone who has the authority to enforce the law on citizens should be held to a HIGHER standard. Since you're a cop in California, I'd be surprised if you held yourself to such a standard. You get to enjoy the special rights that most average citizens in California are denied because of your job.

Here he's doing a rather poor job of expressing his discontent over California's insistence of limiting the citizens of the state's rights to own Semi-automatic rifles, and indeed, even semi-automatic handguns and magazines over the capacity of 10 rounds; a sentiment shared by the vast, vast majority of this sub.

With regards to the ""special rights"", he means specifically your possessing on an un-neutered semi-automatic rifle and magazines over the capacity of 10 rounds. /u/JediGeek feels that you should be held to the same limitations. Honestly, I'd prefer that citizens be brought up to your standard, though restricted by the federal National Firearms Act, of course.

To further emphasize this point I direct you to /u/wichitawesome's post http://i.imgur.com/5g8V7aE.jpg https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/4ftxju/my_duty_guns/d2by24q

&gt; Also, yes, people call the police when bad things happen. You guys essentially show up to do paperwork after the crime has happened. In general, the police exist to condition the public to kneel to authority. There is very little effort to actually stop or solve crime. The Supreme Court even ruled that police have no duty to protect. What good are you then?

At this point, /u/JediGeek is obviously upset. Personally, I wish he'd chill and try to express his points more constructively. 

He kinda loses the plot here, it's obvious at this point he doesn't really like the police, or really most governmental authority. That's his right though, as long as he still obeys the law. 

He swings wildly back and forth, talking about how police response times mean they often show up AFTER a crime has been committed, which they cannot be blamed for really, officers can't be everywhere.  He then says that ""the police exist to condition the public to kneel to authority.""  I don't really agree with that, I believe the Police are there to enforce law, gather evidence, and protect the citizenry when they are able to. However, the fact that the police are unable to be everywhere at all times, and that ""The Supreme Court even ruled that police have no duty to protect"", /u/JediGeek is trying to make the point that we individual, lawful citizens have a duty and a right to defend ourselves, presumably with the same or similar weaponry that the civilian police force has.

I hope that clears things up abit, and if you would like to discuss things further I'd love to, though it may take me abit to respond.

I would like to note one more thing though:

In looking through your comments, it seems like you still have a military mentality. You refer to your job as your mission, and use a lot of language that you no doubt learned and used during your service in the Army.

However, there is something you should not forget. The Police Forces of the United States are *civilians*. You are employed by the state/country/municipalities/etc as a civilian. As much as we like to sugar coat it, a solider's job is to find the enemy and kill them. A police officer's job is to serve the community while enforcing the law.

2915,"Everyone in this thread with this problem, here is my advice to you. Lose some weight.

Now, before you crucify me, let me tell you my story.

Three years ago I weighed 373 pounds. I had been overweight my entire life, I had been obese since middle school, I had been morbidly obese since highschool. At my max known weight I was 385 pounds. I had never exercised, I had never tried to eat right, and I was on a path to dying in my 30's.

And then, just out of the blue, something happened that flipped a switch in my brain and made me get my shit together. That day I went for a walk. It took me two hours to walk two miles, and I collapsed in a heap on my kitchen floor when I was done. Yet, the next day, I got up and did the same thing, and the day after that, and the day after that.

I started tracking calories and went from eating about 3-4000, possibly even 5000 a day to just 1600 (though I recommend you start at 2000 and then lower from there when you adjust).

And guess what, IT FUCKING WORKS. There is no secret to getting healthy, it just takes time and commitment.

You will feel better, you will sleep better, you will look better, your mental state will be better, you will cary a gun better, you will shoot better, YOUR SEX WILL BE BETTER.  If you are honest with yourself and do the work, it will happen.

So we need more information.

We need pics of your AR, pics of your spring and buffer, preferably laid out next to your stock, a pic of your BCG.

Where you buy it from and who makes your AR?

Does racking the charging handle chamber a round no problem? Or does it hang up? How would the rounds fail to feed? Would they get stuck while sliding into the chamber? Or would the bolt just ride over the next round?

Hmmmmmmmm, did you build your AR, or buy it used? Then I'm going to go with someone put a rifle length buffer in a carbine length buffer tube, because that would explain failure to eject, failure to feed, and the ""heavy"" rearward slam.

In regards to your specific question, if you read the linked section of the law, it says: 

&gt; (2.3)  An actor who is not engaged in a criminal activity, who is not in illegal possession of a firearm and who is attacked in any place where the actor would have a duty to retreat under paragraph (2)(ii) has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his ground and use force, including deadly force, if:

&gt;&gt;(i)  the actor has a right to be in the place where he was attacked;

&gt;&gt;(ii)  the actor believes it is immediately necessary to do so to protect himself against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or sexual intercourse by force or threat; and

&gt;&gt;(iii)  the person against whom the force is used displays or otherwise uses:

&gt;&gt;&gt;(A)  a firearm or replica of a firearm as defined in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9712 (relating to sentences for offenses committed with firearms); or

&gt;&gt;&gt;(B)  any other weapon readily or apparently capable of lethal use.

Colt, for some reason or another, isn't like other AR manufactures in that they don't have alot of options. I personally don't know if you can, as a civilian, order an A4 configured AR from them.

Why do you want a Colt? Is it just the pony, or is it because the military uses them?

If it's the military angle, you should know FN now makes the military's M16's and M4's. A 20in FN Ar will run you between 900-1100$ depending on where you find it.

However, you can build an A4gery for much less. Check out mine: http://imgur.com/kkv8Dj9

Dan Wesson is a lovely gun, but the only handgun's I've owned have been Glocks, so it'd be like going from a Carolla to a Corvette.

Then I found this gorgeous FFL that was literally two miles from my house, that I've driven past almost every day, and had no idea was there.

His shop is extremely neat, his prices are competitive with online prices, and it's conveniently located, so I check it out.

End up leaving with an ""Unfired"" used Stainless Springfield Loaded 1911 for $700 and a Glock 19 for $510. Add on sales tax and ammo for both, out the door for $1350.

JSE Surplus 20in Hbar Upper, Chrome-Moly ~~Lined~~ Barrel, F-Marked front sight block, A2 Flash Hider.

JSE Surplus Standard BCG and charging handle.

Stag Arms Lower with generic parts kit that I bought off Gunbroker as part of a rifle I sold the upper to to fund this one. I will note, I believe it has the default trigger on it and I actually like it nearly as much as my RRA's two-stage trigger.

RRA A2 grip from my Car-4

RRA A2 Stock form my Car-4

Military Surplus detachable carry handle.

RRA aluminum magazine.

It does have a Magpul trigger guard because I have been too lazy to switch them between rifles to make it the standard mil-spec one.

Because it was rainy, I was the only person at the rifle range, and it was super relaxing to zero in. Took setting the rear sight one marking line right of center to line up, but it was right on target when there.

I may eventually put a rail segment on the hand guard and put a bipod on it and get a 4x scope of some sort for when I feel like I want to swap out for some range, but I just love the look of the standard A4.

Guys, you should be exercising your body, not just your right to keep and bear arms.

Op, I don't know what your situation is, but you should be doing everything in your power to change it, and change it you can.

I was 385 pounds at my max, today I am down to 190, and it took me just two years to do that.

Control your diet and start doing whatever exercise you can. When I first started, I walked 2 miles, it took me two hours, and my legs gave out when I made it home. But I went out the next day and did the same damn thing. Now I do mud runs and spin classes and all that stuff.

Now, that being said, I have the gut problem too from what weight is left and the loose skin. 4-5 o'clock is where I carry, with the gun canted forward. It is super comfortable there.

I carry a Glock 26 too, and use a Desantis Insider holster. It's a no bullshit leather holster and I find it works great, though you may have to replace it every couple of years. Only downside is it's not rigid at all so it's hard to re-holster if you wear your belt tight, but in my opinion if I need to get rid of my gun fast I'll just put it on the ground, otherwise I can take my sweet time putting it away.

Desantis does make a similar holster that has some rigidity if you want that, however.

3507,"Well the ""rules"" are State Law, so they'd take an act of the State Assembly to change.

But really, the major ones that aren't rules at every other range in the country are no multiple-projectile cartridges (IE: Shot shells or flechette rounds) and the mag limits. 

And considering there's over a dozen ranges, all maintained by the state, paid for by the game commission's budget, and maintained pretty decently I might add, that are open dawn to dusk 99% of the year, it's a small price to pay.

http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=514&amp;objID=620410&amp;mode=2

They used to be free, now you need to have a current hunting (or fur takers possibly) license or buy a $30 range permit that's good from July 1st to June 30th (or something like that, it's for the year no matter when you buy it).

Some people bitched to high hell when they did that, but they have really done a good job with the funds. Replacing the beat to crap wooden benches with very nice concrete ones, regularly maintaining the ranges, replacing backstops and the like.

I will say, there are some rules I wish they'd change up. The rifle ranges are intended for sighting in hunting rifles primarily, so there's a 3 round per mag limit, and if a game warden swings by you can get a ticket for having a mag loaded with more. I haven't seen one the last 4 times I've gone, but one pulled up the three times before that. That being said, it's still a nice time to shoot AR's or AK's, even if you can't legally mag dump them.

The pistol ranges allow you six rounds, and those are actually pretty nice to practice your shooting, the one I go to has backstops at 10, 15, and 25 yards.

If you do go, bring a broom and dustpan. I always try to sweep up some of the extra brass people leave around, after picking up all the 9mm and .223 I can find, of course.

95% of the people there are polite and cordial. A guy even let me squeeze off a few rounds with his Tavor. But every once in a while you'll find someone who is completely disregarding the rules and bumpfiring full mags from his AK or who, like wheel gun guy, just waves his gun around everywhere.",2016-01-28 13:07:42+00:00,czf23r5,3.0,t1_czf1wxs,520.0,CCW

I look at him agape for a few seconds, then pipe up ""Hey, those aren't loaded right."" He looks at me and goes, ""Yeah,"" and I raise a hand, ""Let's keep them pointed down range then,"" and he gives me a look and says, ""They're black powder, I don't have the percussion caps in them,"" and shows the empty notches for the caps.

I just repeated myself, ""Just keep them pointed down range,"" and he proceeds to get an attitude, so we packed up and moved to the rifle range.

3656,"I used to be kissing 400 pounds and have since gotten my shit together and am now in the muscular 180's, if my lazy fat ass can do it, you can too, but I digress.

Being overweight, and by extension massively so, hampers your ability to shoot, period. The way you hold it, where it rests, how it recoils, and the toll that takes on you is amplified when you've overweight and out of shape.

When shooting long-guns you just don't have the endurance to hold it steady over time and that creates muzzle waiver as you fatigue.

When shooting handguns the way you hold it and how the gun fits in your hand changes. I used to think my Glock 26 was a tiny gun, but that was because my massive sausage fingers just weren't what the gun was designed for. After I lost the weight it sits much more comfortably in my grip.

If people want to be obese, fine, I don't think they should be rounded up and put in camps or something, it's your life. But, don't kid yourself, you're being unhealthy, it is /going/ to do damage to you down the road, and you /can/ do something about it. Now. Today. Right this second.

Track your calories to eat a reasonable diet and do just an hour of exercise a day. Start with what you can and build from there.

The first day I started it took me 2 hours to walk 2.2miles, and when I got home my legs literally collapsed and I laid on my kitchen floor to recover. But I picked myself up and went right back out and did it again the next day. No excuses, get your lives together.",2015-12-21 15:38:59+00:00,cy6n9ut,1.0,t3_3xnx4h,39179.0,guns
3657,"Unfortunately, I can't go back and look at the questions again, but I believe the last one was something like ""Do you think having background checks for private sales will reduce firearm crime?""

The problem is YES and NO aren't really good answers because, as with most issues, things get complicated.

There is little doubt in my mind that requiring universal background checks for all firearm purchases would stop some private sales from happening, usually to people who, while not necessarily out to commit crimes with guns, are nevertheless prohibited from owning firearms. It could also cut down on straw purchases, because it would add another step to complete said purchase.

But that's also being idealistic, because without a registry (which I oppose) one could always just ""gift"" firearms, and with straw purchases one could always claim it was stolen. 

But again, on the other side, most criminals are stupid, and I could totally see a situation where one rats on the other for a better deal.

And then there is the problem of tracking guns. Who retains the 4473 form? Are private citizens going to be expected to hold onto this form or something like it when they sell a firearm? Or would that be build into the NICS check? If it's built into the NICS check, wouldn't that create a defacto registration for almost all guns?

The point is, boiling these things down to simple yes or no answers is simplifying the issue massively. But, as I typed this, I realized that you are probably just trying to get peoples base opinions on this and therefore this big post is moot. 

TL;DR: These are complicated issues that are hard to boil down to just Yes or No, but it's probably Moot for OP's purpose anyway.",2015-12-21 15:12:33+00:00,cy6me8l,3.0,t1_cy6jf0q,6832.0,CCW

I point you to the relevant parts:

&gt; ATF hereby confirms that if used as designed—to assist shooters in stabilizing a handgun while
shooting with a single hand—the device is not considered a shoulder stock and therefore may be
attached to a handgun without making a NFA firearm.

So your rifle is still OK. However, this changes if you ever put that sig brace against your shoulder.

&gt; The pistol stabilizing brace was neither “designed” nor approved to be used as a shoulder stock,
and therefore use as a shoulder stock constitutes a “redesign” of the device because a possessor
has changed the very function of the item. Any individual letters stating otherwise are contrary
to the plain language of the NFA, misapply Federal law, and are hereby revoked.


&gt; Any person who intends to use a handgun stabilizing brace as a shoulder stock on a pistol
(having a rifled barrel under 16 inches in length or a smooth bore firearm with a barrel under 18
inches in length) must first file an ATF Form 1 and pay the applicable tax because the resulting
firearm will be subject to all provisions of the NFA. ",2015-12-15 04:04:31+00:00,cxzflqe,11.0,t1_cxzb588,11509.0,guns

I could easily hide a .22 derringer, but I feel .22's are too light a load and that derringers don't have enough capacity for self-defense.

Some guns have free-floating firing pins, IE, they move around, and might go off if dropped. The SKS is one.

HOWEVER, usually, to do that, you have to drop it vertically, so the stock (or front, but who drops a gun barrel first?) hits the ground sharply, making the firing pin bounce forward and strike the primer.

Dropping a gun on its side has a much lower chance of that happening.

Scout choppers also seem fine since they are pretty much glass cannons.

3913,"Ya know, sometime in 2005 I went to this conference/camp thing for high-school students in DC. It was called like the National Youth Leadership Council on Defense Intelligence and Diplomacy.

Looking back, it was really just a thing that looked good on transcripts and got you to talk about and think about this kind of stuff, so an interesting, albeit expensive and ultimately unnecessary experience.

However, the final culmination of the four-ish day event was a role playing experience where everyone in the group (about 30+ kids) took on the role of people in various levels of government from the President all the way down to the aide of an ambassador to Nigeria or something.

The premise of the exercise was that a plane carrying a nuclear warhead crashed in a separatist region of Nigeria sparking a major international incident and at the end the kid playing the role of President would make a speech to the American people about what happened.

I was the Ambassador to Nigeria, and I remember one of the program's employee's coming in a few times and handing me a piece of paper that read something like ""Such and Such rebel group claims to have recovered the nuclear weapon"" or ""Reports of US Special Operations in such and such region"" and I then was supposed to disseminate that information.

Looking back, no one was talking to each other. I remember making a few copies of the notes and trying to send them to the CIA, SECDEF, and Joint Chief like twice, but I never thought to send them to any of the underlings.

At the end of the exercise, some how we got it so fucked up the President, SecDef, and Secretary of State all thought there were two missing nuclear bombs, that we had reclaimed one at some point, but that another was still out there and that the President was ordering a full scale invasion of Nigeria to get it back.

It really gave me pause. We were thirty people, kids true, but still thirty people in the same hotel trying to communicate and get everyone on the same page.

Even pre-9/11, the US government was massive, with dozens of military, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies each with hundreds to thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of employees. Getting everyone on the same page, sorting important information from the inconsequential, redundant, or just bogus and then disseminating that to other agencies of them to sort through as well, it is amazing that it ever happens.

It made me accept that sometimes things fall through the cracks and the enemy gets lucky or is just that good, but that is the price of living in a free society.

Sometimes our countrymen, our loved ones, or even ourselves WILL die to a lone mad man with a gun or an extremist group with a bomb, and that is the burden we carry so that we can have the right to move about freely, be secure in our property and even our very minds, and to not have the government watching over our every move constantly.

If 9/11 happened today, I hope we'd do things differently, but people are scared, and they let their fear make decisions to feel less afraid, even if the reality is that it is almost entirely a show to just make you feel safer.",2015-09-06 05:18:55+00:00,cus8ffc,5.0,t1_curhdzq,56285.0,AskReddit

So naturally I picked it up, showed my siblings and parents, carried the thing around for probably half an hour before setting him on a tree and leaving him to be. Checked back later and he was gone, I assume to tell his bat bros about the wild experience he had.

You seem to have the theory that a person not saying they're under 18 or not of legal age would get a predator off the hook in and of itself.

We can get into arguing age of consent laws, which, personally, I have zero problem with, but to me, a person having no reasonable assumption that another is underage shouldn't make them a criminal if it was a consensual relationship.

And just to be clear, I am arguing in a broad sense, not in relation to this particular case.

For all we know, at this time, rumors could be true and Kane could have roofied a woman to have sex with her, and he got double fucked, and rightfully so if it's true, that she turned out to be under age.
