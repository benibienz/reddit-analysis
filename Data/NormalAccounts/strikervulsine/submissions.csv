10,2016-08-17 02:52:17+00:00,self.guns,https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/4y3du5/its_so_wee_a_ruger_lcp_review/,False,"So last week I purchased a Ruger LCP .380 semi-automatic pistol. I wanted a gun I could leave at my girlfriend's house so I could fly to her out of state home without having to check a bag. I also wanted a reliable CCW for not much money since I have two AR builds in progress.

Being an avid disciple of /r/gundeals, I had heard good things about the LCP, and for $250 at my preferred LGS, I figured why not.

[Here's Lil' CP on its second outing.](http://imgur.com/R05ZIaZ)

Now, I make no claim of being an expert on firearms, so this review is just based on my own rather limited opinion.

The LCP is a single-stack, double action pistol chambered in .380acp with a capacity of 6+1 and no manual safeties. [Here it is compared to my EDC Glock 26 Gen 3.](http://imgur.com/WoEWoaJ).

As you can see, the LCP is alittle over an inch less in OAL, an inch shorter in height (even more with the Pierce extension on my G26's mag), while having about 2/3rds to half of the Glock's capacity. You can see the difference [when the LCP rests on top of the Glock.](http://imgur.com/t4vWxNd) 

However, where the LCP and G26 vary the most is the width. Because it's a single stack, the LCP is [extremely thin. ](http://imgur.com/Me2iBqN) Despite this, you can still get [a decent grip](http://imgur.com/fq0jY5E) on the LCP, though not as nice as the [Glock's.](http://imgur.com/nh0tPGh)

Continuing along, a huge difference between the LCP and the Glock 26 are the sights. [The standard Glock sight's aren't the best,](http://imgur.com/RD9ShIe) but [compared to the LCP's](http://imgur.com/4Bzy68K) they're awesome. The LCP's sights might as well not be there. There is no way you'd be able to pick these things up in anything other than broad daylight. Then again, the LCP isn't designed to shoot distance; it favors more the point and shoot method at close range. I'll probably end up putting a bit of paint on the front sight post to make it easier to see.

Holding the two pistols with their stock magazines is similar. Both the [LCP](http://imgur.com/TysK05c) and the [G26](http://imgur.com/nSTHhPU) stop just below my ring finger. I find the Glock's more curved grip fits my hand better, and the wider frame makes it easier to hold. That being said, the LCP isn't terrible.

Shooting the two pistols, however, is worlds apart. [Glocks have notoriously ~~bad~~ not great triggers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykjesxWEqVI&amp;feature=youtu.be) with some decent slack to them. Because my 26 is approaching 10 years old, the break is actually pretty nice, nicer than my new Glock 19 Gen 3.

However, if the Glock's trigger is ~~bad~~ not great, [the LCP's is terrible.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XnxZx-ZD0Y&amp;feature=youtu.be) It's a tough, long pull the whole way. Research seems to say it's about 8lbs, which makes me shudder to think what the NYPD's 12lb trigger feels like.

The reset is awful too. It has two stages, and the pistol will not fire unless you let the trigger reset in its entirety. 

You can see the effect this has on my shooting. [This is 5 rounds from my G26 at 10 yards.](http://imgur.com/A2Ft9Bg) [Here's the same distance with the LCP.](http://imgur.com/qeeE3Ej) Awful, only three rounds on paper. Thankfully, at 3 yards [it gets better](http://imgur.com/Y102qeu), and [another try at 10 yards](http://imgur.com/9cgYCed) had all 5 on paper this time. I'm sure there are those of you out there who could put 5 rounds in one hole at 15 yards, but that's not what the LCP is designed for. It's supposed to be a last ditch, save your life gun, and at the distance that it'd be called on to fill that, it's accurate.

BTW, the LCP is definitely not a range toy. It recoils hard and is so thin all that force is directed right between your thumb and trigger finger. After three mags my hand was sore. It is not fun to shoot at all.

This brings me to one thing I didn't know about the LCP before I handled it. It doesn't lock open on an empty magazine. [Glocks, like most semi-auto pistols,] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOl95w9-GsI&amp;feature=youtu.be) lock their slides to the rear on the last round fired. [The LCP does not.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVYygelWMak&amp;feature=youtu.be)

In conclusion, the LCP is an excellent pistol for what it is designed to do. It is tiny, and therefore ultra-concealable. It is light, and therefore easy to carry. It is simple, and therefore easy to use. It is cheap, and therefore accessible.

I would wholly recommend it to anyone looking for a pocket pistol to use as a backup gun, or to carry in places you want to make sure no one knows you have a gun.

I wouldn't recommend it as an EDC, I'm going to be sticking to my G26, and if you're looking for a range toy and the ~$200 price tag appeals to you, buy a Hi-Point instead.

So yeah, it's been about a month since the last posting. I haven't gotten to shoot as much as I had in the past, mostly due to doing some extra work to make extra cash to fund ammo for this project, and traveling with my girlfriend.

However, fear not, for I have not given up on my quest to git gud.

**What did I need to work on?** 

* Planting my support elbow for my rifle and **NOT MOVING IT**. That thing should be routed to the ground, and I should adjust my body around it.

* Shifting my Natural Point of Aim on target, and I watched a video just recently that explained how to do such in prone, and am eager to try it out.

* Flinching

**What I've been doing**

* Researching how to find NPOA

* Practicing finding NPOA

* Practicing moving my body around my support elbow.

* Dryfiring, though not as much as I should

**Range Days**

**6-2-16**

Was a short range trip this day.

*Rifle*

[Only target](http://imgur.com/gNOQuM8) 30 rounds in 10-three shot strings at 50 yards.

Not much to say about this. Group 6 was fucking awful, the rest were about what I do, but it's weird that I'd get two rounds pretty close together, and the third wide. I have a theory that I'll touch on later.

*Pistol*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/ykCbAr8) 25 rounds in 5-five shot strings at 10 yards. I can just see my groups shrinking from where I started. Still have a tendency to drop the muzzle now and again, I think it's from me tensing up as I anticipate the noise and recoil of the shot.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/A0Pb3Fb) 25 rounds in 5-five shot strings at 10 yards.  Well, even my worst is better than I was. 2/3rds in the black, and I'm at the point now where I almost always know when I done goofed and didn't pull the trigger right. 

**6-13-16**

*Rifle*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/NDryAIs) 15 rounds in 3-five shot strings at 50 yards. Group 3 was probably the best, though I pushed one round wide left with too much finger most likely.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/aOt661Y)  15 rounds in 3-five shot strings at 50 yards. A meh round. The shots are in the same general area I guess. 

[Rifle Bonus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Bh2jDJmyI) Video of one of my groups being fired.

*Pistol*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/Rqc7kT1) 40 rounds in 4-ten shot strings at 10 yards. Still some muzzle dip, but most of them are right in the black.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/duDkM1F) 50 rounds in 5-ten round strings at 10 yards. Dat muzzle dip low left, dat recoil anticipation upper right. Dat 5th string that went fucking everywhere. Just bad.

**6-14-16**

*Rifle*

[Only Target](http://imgur.com/Ujkqnve) 20 rounds in 4-five shot strings, last one from the bench at 50 yards. I'm getting better at my rifle, but not nearly as much as my pistol, and I'll go into what I think the reason is later.

*Pistol*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/5jKtlmO) 15 rounds in 3-five shot strings at 10 yards. One flyer wide left, but I can see my groups shirking by the week.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/Xxc8Hk4) 15 rounds in 3-five shot strings at 10 yards. It's a good day when your best target and worst target are rather similar. 

**6-20-16**

*Pistol*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/bCxLTX9) 20 rounds in 4-five shot strings at 10 yards.  I chose this one because I have more rounds dead center. This was a short range trip right before the club meeting.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/OIEL5JI) 20 rounds in 4-five shot strings at 10 yards. Pushed some high, which I think is caused by tightening your hand as you pull the trigger?

**6-30-16** 

*Rifle*

[Only Target](http://imgur.com/zuIrAgD) 20 rounds in 4-five shot strings at 50 yards. It's kinda amazing how a slight change in hold over translates to inches difference in groupings at 50 yards. At this distance, these targets are just small dots right above the front sight post. Still, 16 days since I last shot my rifle and it shows. I wouldn't call this very good.

**7-8-16**

*Rifle*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/QBHdPoQ) 20 rounds in 4-five shot strings at 50 yards. A little better than a week ago, all the groups are at least in the same general area.
 

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/WUCtDYs) 20 rounds in 4-five shot strings at 50 yards.  Honestly, if you overlaid the two I think their roughly the same, this is the worse one because more shots are high and outside the black.


*Pistol*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/4aKuyL) 20 rounds in 4-five shot strings at 10 yards. Now this is what I'm fucking talking about. One right, caused by me jerking the trigger. Two low from dropping the muzzle like a pleb, but the rest are that sweet sweet black.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/BnLy9Wf) 20 rounds in 4-five shot strings at 10 yards. For some reason, instead of shooting high right when I flinch like most people, I drop the muzzle and shoot low. 


**Conclusions**


Well, first off: [Here's a demonstration of progress](https://www.dropbox.com/s/19dhggj4gr1ul3b/Progress%201.jpg?dl=0) -- -- Not bad for 2 months IMHO


So, I think I know what to do now and how to do it, it just comes down to practicing. You can see, I'm improving faster with my pistol, and I think I know why; more trigger pulls. I'll be honest, I haven't been dry-firing with my rifle, and while I'm sure that doesn't help, I think there's an even bigger reason. I shoot about a third to a quarter as many rounds with my rifle just due to time restrictions and somewhat the cost. It takes me about half an hour to shoot 20 rounds in 5 shot strings due to walking down to the target to mark it, loading mags, getting set up in prone position, ETC.


How could I fix this? Well, I could stop taking breaks between strings and shoot 10-20 rounds at a time. I was doing 5 shot strings because I wanted to see if I was doing something wrong and then fix it if I was. However, I think that also contributes to my groups not being together. The target is so small that even a slight difference in hold over between strings can spread the groups out on the target. Now that I more or less know what to do and how to do it, would shooting longer strings to get more rounds under my belt help?

Also, with my rifle, I tend to put 4 rounds relatively close together, while a fifth is usually an outlier. In looking at the video, my theory is that, once I've found my NPOA and pull the trigger, the recoil of the rifle shifts everything slightly. I often find my grip on the handguard gets shifted after the first shot. How do I fix this? Or is it just something that happens with prone unsupported shooting?

Any comments or suggestions?

So I think I'm going to make this a weekly post to keep me focused and honest.  

**Things I needed to work on**

* Consistent cheek weld on rifle

* Firing during respiratory pause

* Smooth trigger pull

* Flinching

**What I've been doing**

* Focusing on my breathing

* Dry firing both pistol and rifle

* Touching my nose to the charging handle to get consistent cheek weld


In an attempt to keep this more manageable, I'm going to post my best and worst targets for both pistol and rifle for the day.

**Range Days**

**5-16-16**

*Rifle*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/VAXcQOd) 50 Yards, prone unsupported, still no sling. 15 rounds in 3-five shot strings. 1 and 3 are actually pretty decent, even 3 where I just felt off and uncomfortable, probably because I have soft baby elbows. Two I'm spread out, most likely from flinching for the low right and too little trigger finger the wide left.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/4KP2uQ4) 50 yards, standing. Not awful, but not good either. Honestly, this was just because someone showed up at the range and was uncomfortable with me shooting prone.

*Pistol*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/b0mOCxR) Last pistol target of the day. 10 yards, 10 rounds in 2-five shot strings. I was really trying to focus after my last target which was the worst of the day. Pretty decent if I do say so myself. Two shots alittle low, but a nice centered cluster. Improvement, yay!

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/zJPxCer) 10 yards, 20 rounds in 2-ten round strings. Some flinching causing muzzle dip, but atleast when I do that I'm still shooting straight. The 3 high flyers I honestly have no idea what I was doing there.

*Conclusions* 

By now, I can more or less ""feel"" when I was on target or not, so it's a matter of just focusing and being **consistent**. Consistency is key*


**5-19-16**

*Pistol*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/IpfwSVC) 10 yards, 20 rounds, 2-ten round strings. Honestly, I'm not impressed with myself this day. It was not a good day at the range. I hadn't been dry-firing, I'd been working day shift, it was just blah.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/ba0SxK7) 10 yards, 20 rounds, 4-Five round strings.  It was hard to choose the worst target today, but I went with this one. Awful, I was flinching like crazy, and the only good thing I can say is atleast it's mostly centered.

*Conclusions*

Just because you're tired, doesn't mean you should skip dry-firing practice.

**5-23-16**

*Rifle*

Note: This was when I got /u/martisa02's extra sling. For those of you who don't know, the [loop sling method](http://artoftherifleblog.com/the-loop-sling/2011/08/the-loop-sling.html) is a form of shooting where you use the sling as another point of contact to keep the rifle steady. It's kind of like having a brace to rest the rifle against.

[Before sling](http://imgur.com/t9xVcR2) 50 yards, 10 rounds, 2-five shot strings. Not bad but not good, and definitely left to right movement.

[After Sling](http://imgur.com/BZ2SEyy) 50 yards, 15 rounds, 3-five shot slings. Even using the loop sling method for the first time you can see the spread has tightened up considerably. 

Note 2: It was after this that I realized I zeroed my rifle incorrectly the first time. To do a 25/300 zero with a flat top upper, you *don't* turn the elevation knob to Z. No wonder I was confused when trying to shoot at 100 yards. Everything I'd heard was that you had to hold low because at 100 yards with a 300 yard zero, the round will impact about 7 inches high. In my experience it'd been pretty much straight on, but that was because I am a derp. Rifle is now correctly zeroed, and I even got a front sight adjustment tool and moved the front post down so the right impacts right above the post, instead of right behind it.

[100 yards](http://imgur.com/GvvyS7Q) 8.5 MOA, whooo /s You can see the few hits of string 1 and 2 where I had been holding the rifle centered.

*Conclusions*

The loop sling method definitely helps, and I will be using it from now on.

**5-25-16**

*Pistol*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/XEyywZ8) 15 rounds in one string. A few flinches, but most of them are centered. The higher ones were where I was experimenting with POI. Seems with my Glock 19, when I do everything correctly, the round impacts just above the front sight post.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/KxYHuSJ) 15 rounds in one string. I know I missed at least twice, if not the full three times. Major flinching. This was just after getting done with day shift again and hadn't gotten back on the dry-firing train.

*Rifle*

[Hold Over Practice](http://imgur.com/TgNBL1n) This day was really an attempt at figuring out the hold over position at 100 yards. You can see from the chart at the top most of it was from a supported bench position. Average there was a 4.5 MOA. When switching the prone that grew to a 9 MOA. Definitely need to keep practicing, but I think I got the hold over figured out.

*Conclusions*

Dry-firing pays dividends and I *NEED* to keep doing it

**5-27-16**

*Rifle*

[50 Yards](http://imgur.com/sOi4NAn) 20 shots, 4-five shot strings. OK, but I seem to put 4 rounds close and then send a 5th wide somewhere. I'll talk more in conclusions.

[100 yards](http://imgur.com/vDVGzF9) You can see in the write up. Best group was 2.75 MOA. If I can shoot like that every time, I'll be happy. Average while prone using the sling for the first six was about 6.5 MOA.  Strings 7-10 I did in all one mag in less than a minute. That wasn't the thing to do. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. I'm not ready to shoot like that and it's really just a waste of time and ammo to try. 11 and 12 were bench supported and average 4.5 MOA, same as just two days prior.

*Pistol*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/DKNyBFD) 10 yards, 20 rounds, 2-ten round strings. Still a few muzzle dips, but most of them are inside the 3"" ring.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/Mro4vTh) 10 yards, 20 rounds, 2-ten round strings. If I had had more bullets with me, I would have shot more. I wasn't happy with this being the last target of the day.

*Conclusions*

With my rifle, I think the biggest problem is STAYING PUT. I'll set up, and then I'll wiggle around, which makes putting shots in the same group in the same place almost impossible.

With my pistol, well, more dry-firing, as always.


**What am I doing well?**

* With my rifle, I think I'm pulling the trigger correctly. When I dry-fire I can do it without making the sight picture move. 

* Zero is corrected

* Positioning is better, with arm under receiver, and loop sling correctly used.

* With pistol, I'm straightening out my shots, even with I do flinch.

**What do I need to work on?**

* More dry-firing

* Planting my support elbow for my rifle and **NOT MOVING IT**. That thing should be routed to the ground, and I should adjust my body around it.

* Shifting my Natural Point of Aim on target, and I watched a video just recently that explained how to do such in prone, and am eager to try it out.

* Again, don't go too fast. Take your time, relax, give yourself a few moments between groups to focus.

* Stay at 50 yards until I'm punching one hole. Stretching to 100 was interesting, but I'd be better served just focusing on 50 until I'm punching out the center every time.

* Toughen up my baby soft elbows.

**Your thoughts?**

Do you like these posts, though I'm going to do them regardless?

Recommendation on stretching exercises?

[The Rifle](http://imgur.com/PhG26N2)

[The Pistol](http://imgur.com/DqbEiIm)


So I think I'm going to make this a weekly post to keep me focused and honest.  

**Things I needed to work on**

* Consistant cheek weld on rifle

* Firing during respiratory pause

* Smooth trigger pull

* Flinching

**What I've been doing**

* Focusing on my breathing

* Dry firing both pistol and rifle


In an attempt to keep this more manageable, I'm going to post my best and worst targets for both pistol and rifle for the day.

**Range Days**

**5-10-16**

*Rifle*

All targets posted at 50 yards

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/20XJcGH) This is awful. 8 shots from bench unsuported after 12 from prone that were... ""meh"". Only 2 in the black, 6 all around the outside.

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/WcabVPc) Next 10 shots, same position. Much better, 9 in the black, concentrated high left, one in the white alittle higher. Not exactly the tightest groups, but better.


*Conclusion* 

Considering this is the next day after part 1, not much improvement. After this day I started dry-firing my rifle, and focused on firing during respiratory pause, which I think is the main reason I was all over the place on the worst target.

*Pistol*

All targets at 10 yards.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/77bn798) Five shots. Yep, five. Awful, totally missed with three.

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/QEtq4vw) Not necessarily the best target, but the most indicative of my performance. 15 rounds shot in a string. Target speaks for itself.

*Conclusion*

I'm still flinching pretty bad here, need to focus on trigger pull. Steady pressure, first finger pad, focus on front sight.


**5-12-16**

*Rifle*

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/WYGwAqD) 20 rounds fired in 5 round strings at 50 yards from unsupported bench since there were other people at the range. Best group was the 4th, pretty tight, though slightly low and right. Overall, 75% in the black, all of them in the white circle. Wost shot was the wide left #2, most likely from flinching.

Worst target is not pictured. Posted an 8 inch circle on a 12'x12' square at 100 yards, fired 2-5 round strings from bench unsupported. Hit the circle twice and was all ready to hate myself until I saw that I clustered 6 hits on the bottom edge of the square. I had been holding low to compensate for bullet ride at 100 yards with a 300 yards zero. Obviously over compensated, I'm beginning to suspect that, with my skills, I should just hold the top of the post over the target and not try to get fancy.

*Conclusions*

This is after two nights of dry firing with the rifle. A marked improvement I think. Groups are already tighter, and focusing on firing during respiratory pause is working.

*Pistol*

All targets at 10 yards

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/hIh4amH) First pistol target of the day. 15 rounds, 8 of them I'm flinching like a little bitch, other 7 are pretty good.

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/z3jZJ8t) Last pistol target of the day. 10 rounds, 9 of them in the black. Pretty nice if I do say so myself. I focused, I relaxed, I did everything I was supposed to do for the most part and it shows.

[Target of Note](http://imgur.com/D2vabCw) As you can see form the note, first three shots were everywhere. I put my gun away, took a walk, picked up my shells, then reset. Still flinched on one and put another high, but the five were right on the money.

*Conclusions*
I'm at the point where I can tell when I do something wrong. I can pull the trigger and have a good idea whether I hit the black or not.

**5-13-16**

*Pistol*

Started here this time, all targets at 10 yards.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/NlRCHQ9) Last pistol target of the day. 5 rounds as fast as I could pull the trigger. I'm definitely not a pro. No real need to explain this.

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/hsKLesF) Two-five round strings. 9 in the black, one low left, a flinch. 

*Conclusions*

I'm getting better, but I'm still fighting the flinch. I seem to do better if I don't take my time to think about things, and therefore build up the anticipation of the recoil, but not too fast, obviously. I've been working on trigger reset too, letting it only come back enough to reset, but not entirely.


*Rifle*

All targets at 50 yards.

[Worst Target](http://imgur.com/Jh0IkXs) Trying some things up. After talking to an Appleseed volunteer I tried doing the canted prone position to get my nose on the charging handle in an attempt to work on consistant placement. I also tried to get my support arm under the receiver for a more stable position. It was a light day that day, only 30 rounds fired, so I need to practice these more.

[Best Target](http://imgur.com/95tOjen) 10 rounds prone, 2 strings of 5. Pretty nice, especially that three right in the middle, though they're from two seperate strings.

*Conclusion*

when I put my arm under the receiver, the sway from my breathing was reduced considerably. It feels like an awkward position, but I think I just need to practice it more so it becomes natural.


**What I'm doing well?**

* When I pull the trigger right, it's right. I think I'm doing a better job of it with my rifle.

* I know what needs to be done, it's just a matter of doing it.

**What do I need to work on?**

* Actually DOING what needs to be done. Front sight focus and consistant cheek weld paramount, followed by propper support positioning.

* Quit being a bitch with flinching. I think this just comes from repetition and practice. I'm seeing less wild shots, which means I'm flinching less, it just takes time.

* Push yourself, but not too fast. On the 13th, I was doing some drills and I didn't shoot that well while doing it. I need to push myself, but not too fast, I'm not at the point where I can try to beat Jerry Miculek.

**Your Thoughts**

Honestly, I can see improvement, but I don't really know what's ""Good"" other than making one ragged hole in a target from whatever range you're shooting.

What would qualify as good shooting a 6 inch target with a 3 inch black at 10 yards with a pistol? At 50 yards with a rifle with irons?

**Operation: Git Gud**

AKA: One man's journey from shit to proficient

*Edit: [Part 2 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/4je6ol/operation_git_gud_part_2/)* *[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/4lz21p/operation_git_gud_part_3/)*

**Outline:**
		
The purpose of these posts is to chronicle my attempts to go from a shit shooter to a proficient one.  I've liked guns as far back as elementary school. I was always that weird kid with a book on firearms, and once had the ""Gun Digest Book of Assault Weapons"" taken away from me by an over-zealous study-hall supervisor. However, despite my interest, I never really became more than generally knowledgeable about firearms until the past year when I started seriously collecting them. Still, having academic knowledge is different than having practical knowledge, and today I set out trying to change that.

**Goals:**  The first goal of this series is to pass a version of the US Army's qualification courses for both rifle and pistol. Test to be taken at the end of June.

**Prelude:** 

[Rifle](https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/4i0j1g/oh_no_i_suck_again/)

[Pistol](http://imgur.com/BROHWQ8) This is the only shot I have before I started tying to improve. As you can see, I am all over the place from only 10 yards out.



**Rifle:**

[The Range](http://imgur.com/OaGDoYv):
			Large range with targets at 25, 50, 100, 200, and 300 yards.
			Smaller range with targets at 25, 50, 75, and 100 yards.

[The Rifle](http://imgur.com/PhG26N2):	AR-15, 20in 1:9 twist barrel. Standard USGI carry handle rear sight and f-marked FSB, standard mil-spec trigger.

[Zero](http://imgur.com/W5gJWrH):
		To zero the M16A4 rifle using the 25/300 method, ~~rotate the elevation nob to the Z, 
        two clicks to the left.~~^^^Disregard ^^^that ^^^I ^^^suck ^^^cocks Then make rear windage and front-sight elevation adjustments to 
        bring shots to the middle of the target.


[First three shots](http://imgur.com/VRuL3u1). On target, but left.


[18 rounds](http://imgur.com/oravnd9). People showed up at the range after the first three, so I couldn't get pictures after every three rounds. Yeah, not great. Some in the middle, and tight, but I was left, then right, then left and low. Let's try again.


[12 rounds](http://imgur.com/h1mm57l), making adjustments. First note, I fatigue and get worse as I shoot in a string. Notice flier left and right. However, got her  sighted in, including 6 rounds dead center and low, right where you want it.

Once you're zeroed, turn the elevation knob back to 6/3 and you're set. 

Grab a drink, load some mags, and hang targets while a [turkey](http://imgur.com/J1E3h1c) chills down range, apparently oblivious to the 4 people shooting 5.56mm rounds and up. You're lucky you're not in season.

The plan is to shoot prone, but because it was a nice day I was not alone at the range, so I did unsupported bench shooting to “simulate” prone.  As /u/CampingGeek21 said, “[300 might be a bit far for you with your current skill set. Park at around 50 till you're punching out the center,](https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/4i0j1g/oh_no_i_suck_again/d2ucrt9)”  Well, [here's the first attempt of 12 rounds](http://imgur.com/TkUy0p8). 9 of them in the six inch 7-ring, which is just under 11 MOA, which is about what I shot in the prologue at 300 yards. 

[First two three-shot groups standing position](http://imgur.com/CN48cu4). Got one almost dead center, but that's more of a fluke than anything.

[17 shots at 50 yards](http://imgur.com/tnGI59P), would have been 18, but found a round that look like it had been mauled by some kind of machine, the brass and bullet was shaved off at an angle so I trashed it.  Instead of doing 3 rounds and pausing, the last 11 were one after another because I was running out of time and wanted to move onto pistols.  As you can see, not exactly sub-moa performance. I need to research the proper way to hold a rifle in the various positions.


**Pistol:**

**The Range:** 
			15 yard single person lanes, where you can shoot from 1 yard to 15.

**The Pistol:**
			[Glock 19 Gen 3. Totally factory stock.](http://imgur.com/DqbEiIm)

**Prelude:**  http://imgur.com/BROHWQ8  Again, this is the only picture I have of my shooting before I started trying to get serious. 10 yards with three different guns, and as you can see, I am awful.  About a week ago I started doing dry firing practice. I set a timer for 5-minutes, and will just pull the trigger on the 19 over and over again, attempting to get a smooth break with as little movement as possible.  Let me tell you, in three days I was seeing improvement, and in a week, my groups have shrunk by as much as 2/3rds and have straightened out considerably. Would highly recommend you do dry firing practice.


**The shooting:**
			Targets are 9 inch paper plates, distance is 10 yards.

[Target 1](http://imgur.com/4nepPkG): Five shots, all on target, within about a six inch circle, but I think I can do better.

[Target 2](http://imgur.com/n3yZyoa): And I was right, until I got excited and forgot everything I knew about shooting. The 5th round I just shot off into the ether. No idea if it was high or low, left or right. I got excited and just shanked the last one. Goes to show you, fundamentals are everything.

[Target 3](http://imgur.com/66vNw4k): Three shots pretty close together, and honestly, I can't decide if I missed one again, or if I managed to get two rounds right on top of each other. The top hole is definitely slightly larger than the other three, and I've included pictures of the back of the cardboard, and the cardboard without the plate. I'll let you guys call it, but either way, I shouldn't be shooting that high. http://imgur.com/bfGtLVn  http://imgur.com/Wug9ntq
			
[Target 4](http://imgur.com/gi7CRZm): Here I notice another problem. As the shooting goes on, I start to flinch. Possible ways to mitigate this are to take more time in between rounds, more dry-fire practice, and just more shooting in general.

[Target 5](http://imgur.com/EXDSkI6): One of the better handgun rounds. All rounds within about a 4 inch circle. 

[Target 6](http://imgur.com/7le98eT): High right flier is most likely bad sight alignment, the low left one, barely visible on the edge of the plate, was probably flinching.


[Target 7](http://imgur.com/Tyh05nD): If I recall right, I was shooting faster on these last few targets. Four in the six inch ring, one high flier. Again, most likely improper sight alignment.
		
**Pistol 2:**
			[Glock 26](http://imgur.com/UJhQbQM), my CCW handgun. Most of my shooting will be with the G19, but I want to shoot the 26 too, since it is my EDC gun.

[Target 1](http://imgur.com/WZDAXhd): One shot dead center, three low, one wide left. I seem to have a harder time lining up the G26's sights, I shoot low with it a lot. And the wide left was likely flinching.

[Target 2](http://imgur.com/v2UPaJA): Five on the plate this time, but again, two low and left. I'm fatiguing, and it's making me flinch more. 

[Target 3](http://imgur.com/eyPxhvz):  Five on the plate, but two wide left. Most likely caused by improper trigger pull pushing the gun left.

I also shot my [Springfield Loaded](http://imgur.com/US1bbzL). I'll add that if you like, but I want to focus on the G19.

**Conclusions**:

Well, I got 28/29 rifle rounds at 50 yards inside a 7in circle, and 43-44/50 handgun rounds at 10 yards in a 9 inch circle, which is much better than I was doing even two months ago.

I can recognize what I'm doing wrong, and what I need to improve on.


So, what DO I need to improve on?

Well, for the rifle, there are two major things. First, I need to research proper firing positions for standing, kneeling, sitting, and prone. Second, I need to focus on putting my cheek at the same place on the stock each time. I think that is the most likely reason I kept shooting left on the first zero target..

In general, I need to work on flinching. I seem to be able to control it when I take my time, but if I try to speed up shots, or string many shots in a row, I start to anticipate the recoil. It probably doesn't help that I started shooting with 12ga slugs.

So now  I ask you, good people of /r/guns, how am I doing? What am I doing well? What am I doing poorly? What do you recommend? Do you have any resources you can point me at that I could read or watch to improve my shooting? I throw myself at your mercy.

**TL;DR. OP is a bad shot, he shows how bad he is, and asks for your help in improving.**


*Edit:* Two more things to work on.

1. Maintaining proper breath technique, and firing during respiratory pause

I posted a review of this product in /r/guns a few weeks ago, but decided to update it and post it here since this seems like a more fitting sub.

The story goes that I was looking for a door organizer for my Stack-on 8 rifle cabinet because I was running out of room. The commercially available ones didn't appeal to me because the reviews said they were all junk that fell apart and couldn't hold weight.

After an unsuccessful trip to the local hardware store for pegboard, I finally decided to just get what I wanted in the first place and order a custom panel of MOLLE from http://www.wildecustomgear.com/

Since it was custom made I expected it to take weeks, and was quite surprised when I placed my order very late on the 25th, it was shipped on the 26th, and I received it the 29th.

Here it is: http://i.imgur.com/MKotHwR.jpg 

It's a 9x44 piece of Molle webbing in coyote tan. The first thing I noticed when taking it out of the packaging is that it's heavy. The fabric is very dense and solid, I don't feel like it's going to rip or tear. Cost was $60. They're priced by square inch in teirs of 50 inches. Cheapest is $20 for up to 100in^2, most expensive is $375 for 2500in^2

http://i.imgur.com/s4RZOqo.jpg  

http://i.imgur.com/e8sqREC.jpg 

There's about a half inch of hemming around all four sides, the corners look double stitched, and the grommets are on both sides.

http://i.imgur.com/0TqkJYb.jpg 

The back has several pieces of heavy duty velcro. Notice how it's not spaced evenly; I think this is because of the odd dimensions, and instead of just cheaping out they used an extra, smaller piece right on the bottom.

I also ordered a pistol magazine holder. You can get these in rifle or pistol sized, and as many of them linked together as you want. I only ordered one to test them out, but let me tell you, I'll be getting more.

http://i.imgur.com/pxSo9Wj.jpg 

 http://i.imgur.com/hRrH1Ht.jpg  

http://i.imgur.com/9m8AFRL.jpg 

As you can see a lot of fabric goes into a simple pouch. It's made from the same material as the MOLLE panel, and is stitched and double stitched and stitched again. Impressive for something designed to just sit in the safe and not to be carried in a rig, though it's possible you can do that. Cost was $6.

http://i.imgur.com/bRAsclh.jpg  15 round Glock mag fits like a glove.

http://i.imgur.com/1xYAWAq.jpg  Milspec 1911 Magazine fits, it's not tight, of course, since it's a single stack. This is my only gripe with anything I'm going to talk about today; the pouch is juuuust too small to fit two 1911 mags inside it. It's possible with single stack 9mm's or smaller you could fit two in a single pouch.

http://i.imgur.com/JnD6YVO.jpg  Here it is, panel attached to the door of my Stack-on 8 gun cabinet and the mag pouch in place.

The panel is designed to attach to the fuzzy inside of safe doors, so I used a mix of velcro strips and outdoor permanent mounting tape. It held for about three weeks before letting go. Another trip to the hardware store and I found rolls of Gorilla brand mounting tape rated to 30 pounds. I used three rolls and basically coated the inside of the door, and the panel seems much more solidly attached. 

http://i.imgur.com/Q5TcuG9.jpg  I also ordered a 2 AR mag pouch, which I plan on reviewing later when I get a few pouches to compare it to. Everything mounts with these plastic straps, called Tactical Tailor Malice Clips.

http://i.imgur.com/pF7OJJa.jpg  Two fully loaded mags in place.


Shortly after my first order WCG released adjustable holsters to go with their panels. It's nothing complex, heavy duty velcro straps stitched to a MOLLE panel. http://www.wildecustomgear.com/store/molle-gun-safe-door-panel-organizer-pistol-holster

Same high quality stitch job, cost is $10.50. I feel like this is slightly high, I'd prefer about $8, but then we're bickering over the cost of a cheesburger at McDonalds.

http://imgur.com/ysJaTOt He's a pic of the panel in the cabinet with everything attached. It seems to be holding so far, I might add the four AR Mag pouch to the bottom at some point.

I am almost never spurred to write up a review of products, let alone take pictures and write an essay, but this product was exactly what I was looking for, exceeded my expectations, and was delivered extremely quickly. I highly recommend this product, and if you have a safe with the fuzzy inner door covering, I'd recommend it even more.

1. She doesn't like Gratuitous gore. For example, Hostel would not be a good choice. Gore is fine as long as it's not the main focus of the movie.

2. I am a big pussy and have barely watched any horror movies before, so I do not know what is quality and what is made for SyFy crap.
