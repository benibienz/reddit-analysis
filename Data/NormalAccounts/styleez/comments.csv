1,"I think Nance is a better fit with the first unit, and Julius would be better with the second, but Luke said it himself. This season is about development over winning. Julius Randle is still just 21, the organization still has hopes of him turning into an all-star type player, and he's shown flashes with his ability to board, get out in transition, and defend in space. 

To max out his development we need to carefully manage his confidence.

14,"I don't really like the punt strategy. Imo your goal shouldn't be to own 2 categories and lose 2 automatically with the rest being coin flips. It should be to be in the upper half or third of every one and close to the top in maybe 3. The downside of the first strategy is if you happen to get beat in one of the categories you thought you locked down, you're now at a huge disadvantage. I like to go into a matchup confident that a reasonably good week means I could win any category against anyone.

That means I would immediately target players that balance out your fg% and TO's, which is convenient, because the players that do this are mostly high level big men, which is the obvious hole on your roster going into the draft. I would put a lower emphasis on rebounding because you already have two elite rebounding guards.


Not sure who'll be available since you're in a keeper league, but I'd target guys like Al Horford, Derrick Favors, and Lamarcus Aldridge early, and avoid players later on who are similar to your top 2, aka contributors in every category who sacrifice in efficiency. These are guys like Batum, Kristaps, Kevin Love, Kyle Lowry, Isaiah Thomas etc. I wouldn't go near any of them. 

Lots of point guards fall into this mold, but you probably don't need to invest another high to mid pick in one, since Harden is going to be PG eligible this year. If you do feel like you need another one, Dragic could be a good guy to look at.

None of the bigs I mentioned earlier are great shot blockers, so I'd target guys like Andrew Bogut, Robin Lopez, and Steven Adams later on. They're currently projected on ESPN as the 19th, 20th, and 21st centers off the board, and all three guys should average 1.5-2 blocks a game and shoot well from the field, plus none of them turn it over.",2016-10-03 17:50:38+00:00,d8cdzoa,1.0,t3_55ocye,6367,fantasybball

The Lakers currently owe a first round pick to the 76ers, and a first round pick to the Magic.

If it falls in the top 3 again in 2017, we keep it again, and convey it no matter what in 2018. 

Because of the Stepien rule, you're not allowed to trade away future picks in consecutive years. So if we lose our pick this year, we owe Orlando a 2018 first rounder. However if we land in the top 5 in 2018 we get to keep it, and give it up no matter what in 2019. If we keep our pick this year and convey it to the 76ers in 2017 then we owe our 2019 first rounder to the Magic no matter what. And finally if we keep our pick this year and next year, then the first round pick we owe to Orlando disappears and becomes two second round picks that would convey in 2017 and 2018.

61,"Don't get me wrong, I'd be happy if we signed him, but Batum bothers me from an injury perspective. These are his games played for each season of his career:

79

37

80

59

73

82

71

70

You might look at these numbers and feel like 70 games a season over the last few seasons is pretty good, but I had him on my fantasy team this year, and he was questionable in at least half of these games. He had recurring ankle, toe, and foot problems. In the 14-15 season, he had year-long nagging injuries, causing him to shoot 40% from the field.


Barnes missed some games this year, but has played 81, 78, and 82 games in the three years before. 

And to everyone making the point that Batum is better than Barnes at every facet of the game, you're right, but you have to consider their respective ages, especially considering that our young core won't be ready to compete for a few years anyway. Harrison Barnes is four years younger than Batum. 

11.7/1.8/4.9 on .466/.383/.761

13.9/1.4/4.6 on .451/.391/.836

The first line is Barnes this year. The second is Batum when he was 23. I think it's worth noting the 1.4 apg Batum put up that year. Now he's considered one of the best playmaking wings in the game, non-Lebron division, but he had to be given that role to realize his potential. 

Again I would love Batum on the team. But I think Barnes is just a better bet over the next four years. His numbers are being depressed by being on GS, where he's usually the fourth or fifth option on the floor. I love his athleticism, shooting, general fearlessness, and championship experience. Plus he's the same age as JC. I think he'd be a good addition to our core, and that a bigger role could help him grow into a really good player. So while Batum would be better immediately, I don't see him making as much sense in the long run.

There's no questioning he's raw, he's just played way less basketball than most other kids his age. Dude also needs to fill out, because getting boxed out and establishing post position were major issues for him.

That being said, he's got unquestionable tools. He has great size for the 4, and if he could add 25 pounds, adequate size for the 5. He's a B+ level athlete at the 4, and an A at the 5. He's an explosive jumper, has the lateral quickness to hedge the PnR, and has decent hands. His jump shot is buttery. He didn't get to show it in college, but his range extends at least to the college 3 right now, and I'd project him as a viable NBA 3 point shooter in 2-3 years.

1) On talent, Mclemore was considered a possible first overall pick for much of 2012-13. Issues with his mentality caused him to drop and, along with general Kings problems, are likely to blame for his failure to break through at the NBA level. On the other hand, everyone **loves** Buddy's confidence, work ethic and competitive fire. 

2) TIL 10 ppg is marginal.

3) His turnover percentage of 13.2 is right in line with other players of his usage percentage. Of the top 10 NBA players in usage percentage this season, Kobe has the lowest turnover percentage at 10, which is misleading because half of his shots are basically turnovers. Second lowest is Damian Lillard with 12.5. The highest number in the top 10 is 16.6. 

4) He's not *extra* old. He would be extra old if he was born in September, at the beginning of the cutoff period, not in December at the end. If he had started school a year earlier, he wouldn't have turned 18 until December of his freshman year. 

5) Buddy Hield is not the same player as Lillard or McCollum. Yes his assist numbers are lower, but his scoring is better. In a fluky 12 game sample size, McCollum shot 51.6% from 3 his senior year, but otherwise, Hield's shooting numbers are uniformly better than what Lillard and McCollum put up. Higher fg%, 3p%, 2p%, ft%. He put up a slash line of 50/46.3/89 while taking 8.6 3's a game. That's fucking outrageous. And he did it in the Big 12, not the Big Sky or the Patriot League.

6) If you're looking for a comparison in terms of size and playstyle, Wes Matthews was listed at 6'3"" throughout his college career, played 4 years, averaged the same amount of steals his senior season, never averaged above 2.5 assists per game, and has had a great NBA career.

Porzingis is the most important player on the Knicks by far. Nothing else on their roster really matters at this point. For him to reach his potential, he has to be unguardable by smaller players in the post. If you let teams go small against him, it puts you at a huge disadvantage defensively.

145,"This is probably BS, but it gives me an excuse to post the greatest NBA fan theory of all time. This was posted a long time ago, but it's super relevant now. 

The Lakers are the movie Gladiator. 

Dr. Buss is Marcus Aurelius, a highly esteemed leader who reigned over a golden age. The story begins as they are on their last legs.

Phil Jackson is Maximus, the highly decorated head coach/general of the realm's forces. 

Jeanie Buss is Lucilla, daughter of the emperor/owner, romantic interest of the coach/general, and generally considered to be more sane and capable than her weird brother.

Jim Buss is Commodus, son of the emperor, who guides the empire down a dark path.

Everyone in Rome/Lakerland loved Phil/Maximus, and upon the passing of Marcus/Dr. Buss, it was intended for each of them to succeed their mentor and assume leadership. In the movie, Marcus Aurelius told Maximus this face to face, and in real life there was a standing offer for Phil to return to coach the Dwightmare Lakers. 

Upon learning this, the shady son, who despises Maximus/Phil for his relationship with his father and sister, does some sketch ass shit in the middle of the night, bypassing the established order and installing himself as ruler after his father dies. Commodus kills Marcus Aurelius before the emperor had informed anyone of his plans for succession, and Jim Buss got Mitch to call Phil at 3AM to let him know he hired D'antoni, despite the fact that PJax was offered the job only a few days earlier, and had never declined, only asked for time to make his decision. 

Maximus and Phil are then sent into exile, as Commodus/Jim run the empire into the ground, which is where we find ourselves currently.

The return of Phil and his defeat of Jim would signify the end of the movie, leaving the Laker empire to regain their rightful power.",2016-02-08 20:31:06+00:00,czslyd2,1.0,t3_44seja,5304,nba

If that's the case, put yourself in Russell's shoes. You just lost after not playing in crunch time. Again. You're pissed. There's also a fuckton of pressure on you coming from the fan base, with a growing portion of them calling you a bust. You're a little insecure. Some reporter asks you if you know what you're doing wrong, and you're supposed to say ""yeah, I don't work hard enough?"" No, you're going to try and deflect.

Justise has put up 7.1 ppg, 1.3 apg, and 4.9 rpg in 28 minutes. I love Winslow and his potential, but that is low level role player production.

He was always going to be a guy that needed time to adjust to the speed of the pro game, since he's not an elite athlete, so we should all just be patient and watch for improvement. If there's no progress throughout the year then we can start to think about panicking, but for now we should all just calm down and let it play out.

I'm not trying to compare them in quality, although I do rate Coutinho pretty highly, but his playing style reminds me a lot of a young Ronaldinho. I like Sandro, and Munir is definitely talented, but both project as central players in my opinion, and to be completely honest, neither seem close to guaranteed that they will ever be Barcelona first team quality. 

Basically, I don't see the upcoming wide forward prospects currently in Barca's ranks, which is easily the most vulnerable spot on the team in terms of depth, and I think Coutinho would be a great addition to the team.

216,"Most non-Laker fans probably don't remember that the team had a very promising young backcourt before Kobe even came into the picture. Nick van Exel and Eddie Jones started as 22-23 year olds for a Lakers team that made the playoffs in 95 and 96 without Shaq or Kobe. 

With young Kobe on the bench, Eddie Jones made the all-star team in 97. In 98, both he and van Exel were all-stars, helping the Lakers to win 61 games and meet the Jazz in the conference finals.

Eventually they were both traded, in large part to allow Kobe to grow into his role, which history ultimately proved was the right move. Still, given the circumstances, if you replaced Kobe on that team with a comparable talent at a big man spot, they unquestionably would have been a deeper, more complete team because you wouldn't have had to break up that backcourt for an uneven return.
