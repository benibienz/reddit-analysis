46,I think porn plays a big part into it. Men grew up being told masturbation/porn was normal and women were told it was inappropriate. Its also harder to masturbate as a woman without toys and its embarrassing to purchase one for most girls. So girls are deprived from masturbation whereas men can do it daily which I'm sure effects sex drive. My parents grew up thinking masturbation was terrible so they had a great sex life. I grew up being told the same and my boyfriend grew up jackin' it daily. So now here I am deprived of sex because my boyfriend has a low sex drive.

53,"Holy shit this sounds just like my dad. He loves telling jokes, making people laugh, no matter how dumb he looks or if it hurts anyones feelings, his main goal is to get a laugh and he will try as hard as possible to get it. When we don't laugh or when we don't find it funny or get our feelings hurt, he gets very sensitive and huffy. 

At first I would always laugh because I felt bad and didn't want him to react the way he usually does. But now, I ignore him or act like I didn't hear him and if he reacts that way I still just don't say anything. Because why should I change the way I act around someone that I not only care and love about, but should be doing the same to me. 

If this situation happened to me, I don't think I could ignore it simply because that was MY day and NOT his and he did not need to interrupt like that.

 I think you should let him know it hurt you, or at least made you upset, and talk with him about it like adults one on one. If anyone else is in the room he might throw a fit (like my dad does) to see if anyone is on his side and get even more angry to see no one is. So keep it between you two.

75,"I work at an after school daycare within an elementary school and this is way more true than you can imagine. The worst part is that parents do not truly care for their kids, they care about how their kids make THEM look. Once a teacher came in and told one of the kids ""Remember, if you finish your homework, you will get a candy bar!"" My jaw dropped. Why would you bribe a kid to do their homework? Why don't elementary students want to learn? When I was in elementary school, I loved learning and wanted to succeed. These kids now couldn't care less because the teachers don't try to engage them. They let them get away with throwing fits, not doing homework, and these kids know how to abuse this system. They aren't dumb. They cry to get attention, they cry to get their way, they are not actually upset, they just know how to make you give them what they want. This isn't the teachers fault, either. It's usually the parents scaring the shit out of the superintendents, forcing them to become pussies enable to keep their jobs, and I personally cannot stand it.",2016-04-07 16:05:00+00:00,d1tobr6,4.0,t1_d1tnqev,735.0,AskReddit

81,"Eh, everyone is being very hyperbolic on here. The only reason I ever asked my boyfriend to not wear condoms had nothing to do with wanting a baby. I knew he was clean because I was his first kiss, first girlfriend, first everything. When I asked him to not wear a condom, I was on birth control and I only wanted him to feel more satisfied with the sex and I wanted to feel closer to him. When this happened, we have been dating for a year at this point which I guess is a bit different from your story. I never let him cum inside me, I always had him finish on my back, butt, or stomach just to be 100% sure pregnancy wouldn't happen. Now if she wanted you to cum in her, she either has a fetish or actually does want a baby. I recommend you talk to her about this and find a compromise, don't just end it.

85,My point is that you will make as much as any other person at your job within the same position as you regardless of gender. Seeing a statistic that says women make .70 to every dollar a man makes seems bad until you find out they grouped together every man and woman in every position at any job in America. A woman working as a store clerk is obviously going to make less than a male psychologist. Your compensation is your choice. You choose whether or not you go to college and get a well paying job. You can't blame men for doing that and getting more money than you. ,2016-01-24 01:14:30+00:00,cz9j6q2,3.0,t1_cz9hwcj,2302.0,AskReddit
