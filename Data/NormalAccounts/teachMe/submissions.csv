The system doesn't recognize the adapter for the purpose of charging, but it will run off of it for power.  The battery remains at 1% which I assume is 1% or 0%.   In the official Dell support forums, this problem is addressed through a BIOS update, which I did find the appropriate version for for this model.  However, you all know that if the power dies mid flash, you can brick the machine.  The BIOS updater says not to attempt the update with &lt; 10% charge, but this issue happens on machines that necessarily have &lt; 10% charge.  The battery hatch is not exposed, so I cannot swap in a charged battery. Given that the power adapter actually works, should I even attempt the flash?

This is meant to highlight other current players that are at Joe's skill level and above.  I don't mean to make this into any kind of petty thing.  Post names (and clips, if you have them) of other current players  that would be enjoyed if you like Joe Dart.  I think there are a lot of Midwest (Chicago/Detroit) players that get that Motown/Jamerson sound simply from proximity.

To start the list:

* Pino
* Garrett Sayers
* Sharay Reed
* [Bobby Vega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPzwuiJCSbs)
* Carol Kaye
* Joshua Young
* Young Chuck
* Rick James [(this one)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D_smzbSV6I)

* [Dane Alderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TrcZ_QQaEM)
* Derrick Hodge
* Mike Santamaria

In an AMA, Joe listed his influences as: Flea, Pino, Jamerson, Verdine White, Rocco Prestia, Stuart Zender, Bernard Edwards

I think there are host of jazz players that have the chops and groove for it, but don't always play funk, like Oteil, Janek, Bona, Hadrien, Anthony Jackson, Yolanda Charles, Michael League.  I guess that's a big rabbit trail.
