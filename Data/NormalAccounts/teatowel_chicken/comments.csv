They helped massively, he also referred me for CBT which helped too. I was also suffering from PTSD too which I went to see a counsellor for. 

The only person who I found to be really unhelpful was my health visitor, who tried to make out that I was a nutter who was going to harm my daughter, sent social services round and was just generally quite nasty.
