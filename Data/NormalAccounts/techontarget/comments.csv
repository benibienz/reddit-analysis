With America ""winning"" the Cold War and coming out on top with the most (at the time) advanced military force of its size. The USSR split and fell apart into the smaller countries that saw the opportunity to split away from the now former USSR. Fast forward to the mid 1990's. The USA has started to act as the self-appointed with UN support ""police force of the world."" Fast forward again to the early 2000's, Russia under Vladamir Putin starts to test the UN/Western Europe by moving troops into Georgia (The Country formerly part of  the USSR, not the state) and essential counts coup against the USA. Then jump to the 2010's when Russia actually invades the Ukraine. This is a turning point that the USA and the UN fail to stop (keep in mind there might not have been a peaceful solution). After doing nothing on the Ukraine issue Russia sends military support to the Syria, in some circles this is viewed as the first step of Russia taking the mantle of ""Most powerful country in the world"" and the USA is no longer the only country that holds a significant sway over the UN. Even though Russia has not been a member of the UN since 1991, they are beginning to influence UN policy through demonstrations of force.",2015-10-01 15:29:19+00:00,cvkkgfi,1.0,t3_3n0v62,62750.0,explainlikeimfive
