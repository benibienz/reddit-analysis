113,"I took a flannel, I brought 4 into a fitting room to try them on (i'm really skinny so i was genuinely trying them on to see if they fit okay) then went back out and got different ones and just stuffed one into my bag. 

The attendant had just asked me how many items I had, the first time I said 4 and had 4, the second time I said 4 and had 5.

i'm wearing the shirt right now!

Edit: Whoops, I forgot to say, this was at a Vans store in the mall. They only had one fitting room but it was really nice. It wasn't really guarded, the attendant just let me say how many I was bringing in then she yelled to the person at the register ""4 in"" or something, she didn't actually count herself. They let me bring my backpack in, this was close to the college though so I assume lots of customers have backpacks usually. 

edit2: I still need more flannels though, I basically wear jeans+tee+flannel yearround and I don't have enough flannels for variety. Anyone have advice for lifting from Uniqlo?
