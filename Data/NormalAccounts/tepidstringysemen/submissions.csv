Up 'til this point I'd only snagged sushi from Whole Foods. I've only actually done this maybe 3 times, most of my posts were made up. Today I went to Whole Foods again because I was buying groceries for my mom. They had the kinds of water bottles I wanted so I just put one in one of the cupholder pouches on my backpack. The labels on these are at the very base so it was obscured. I probably spent like 20 minutes in the store though waiting for texts on what ingredients to buy. 

Now at this point I was getting cocky. I headed to Big 5 sporting goods to try to get another bottle (the one I got from whole foods wasn't insulated) but they didn't have any insulated bottles. I ended up buying some sweat pants with zippered pockets that I needed for Halloween anyway. 

Act 3. I am still at this same mall with the whole foods and big 5. There's a target attached as well. Now, being a somewhat rationally minded person, I searched up ""Target"" on here. This is where I believe my story diverges from the ""sane person timeline"". After seeing page upon page of posts recommending against going up against Target, I decided this wouldn't deter me and headed towards the store. There was a mall security guy right by the entrance but he didn't pay attention to me, probably since I hadn't even entered the store yet. 

This entrance goes straight into the electronic department. Conveniently, the sporting goods section is right by there. I walked into the aisle, put an insulated bottle into the other cup holder on my backpack and walked back out. The label was hidden by the backpack again. I saw several target employees while I was there but none in the water bottle aisle. 

The gate didn't beep (because water bottles aren't tagged) but I still think it was a terribly foolish venture. There were black orbs on the ceiling which I assume are those pvz camera things. There was one in the water bottle aisle where I lifted and ""concealed"" it. 

This is the only thing I've stolen from Target, priced at $30, but I've shopped here before.  

If I don't steal anything from Target again, do you think they'll still be able to get me?",Shoplifting,"Friends, I think I'm fucking retarded",https://www.reddit.com/r/Shoplifting/comments/59ry5g/friends_i_think_im_fucking_retarded/

I checked back 20 minutes later (saw it when parking my bike to go to the grocery store, then again when I got back.) and it was still there, still unlocked. 

Then later I went to starbucks to use their wifi and read my textbook and there was another bike. This one had its lock (the coil kind) through the bike and the thingy it was supposed to be locked to but THE LOCK WASN'T CLOSED. So it was just hanging limply without actually keeping the bike from being taken at all. This was outside the mall, one of the busiest and sketchiest areas, and people are leaving their bikes unlocked. That one was still there when I left an hour and a half later. 

You'd think maybe it's just a low bike-theft area, but tons of people, especially at the junior college nearby, myself included, have had bikes stolen, even where people cut through the locks. Yet these fools leave their bikes out in the open relying on thieves' naïveté and god's good gaze to keep them safe.
