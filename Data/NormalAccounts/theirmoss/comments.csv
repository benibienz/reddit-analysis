* Why didn't he provide a lawyer for Heather Clem, the other subject in the sex tape? After all, if this as all about privacy, what about Clem's privacy? Was it not as violated as Bollea's?
* Why didn't he protest the Florida Attorney General who refused to prosecute Lloyd and Calta?

**edit:** for your lawyers:

* [Gertz v Robert Welch, Inc](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/418/323/case.html) — republishing a claim isn’t libelous if the person doing the republishing does not believe the claim is untrue. **I believe the claims of you being a cult leader are true, based on other published evidence.**
* [Hustler Magazine v Falwell](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/485/46) — obvious parody (having sex with one's mother in an outhouse) isn't libelous, and you can't sue for emotional damages for a parody. **What I say is obviously parody. No reasonable person would believe what I say is true.**
* [Schnitt v Clem](http://archive.wtsp.com/news/topstories/article/295022/250/Verdict-Jury-sides-with-Bubba-the-Love-Sponge) — calling a public figure's wife a whore and claiming that public figure is a scam artist is perfectly legal when framed in the right context. **You came here and made wild claims. I responded back with even wilder claims.**
* [Mitchell v Cartoon Network](http://www.avclub.com/article/billy-mitchell-loses-regular-show-lawsuit-doesnt-c-228906) — turning a public figure into a caricature, then mocking said caricature, isn’t legally mocking the public figure. **You and your group are nothing but caricatures.**
