After Butterfly Labs collapses, engineers find new jobs at 21 Inc.
==================================================================

**A bitcoin miner has shipped on time.** Yes, that is news. A new venture-capital backed company, [21 Inc.](https://21.co/), has released a miniature bitcoin miner that they call a ""Bitcoin computer"". For $399.99, you get [a Raspberry Pi, an SHA-256 ASIC board, and a giant fan.](https://21.co/learn/faq/#what-is-the-21-bitcoin-computer)

Again, this is news: normally, a manufacturer of bitcoin miners would [overdesign and underengineer](http://www.buttcoinfoundation.org/butterfly-labs-hot-air) their equipment, or, if they managed to ship something functional, it would be so poorly engineered -- and over budget -- that it be [an explosion waiting to happen](http://www.buttcoinfoundation.org/butterfly-labs-caught-allegedly-faking-ce-certification-bitcoiner-gets-his-miner-seized-in-germany) and/or [priced comparably to a four-door sedan](http://www.buttcoinfoundation.org/butterfly-labs-mini-rig-is-a-huge-broken-unstable-piece-of-shit).

21 Inc. has done something *remarkable* in the Bitcoin world: they started a company that operates like a legitimate business. They're even [listed on Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/21-INC-21BC1-Bitcoin-Computer/dp/B014RD021C/), a company that's so strict with vendors that [Nintendo was kicked off their system for not kissing enough customer ass](http://kotaku.com/5944662/somethings-not-right-between-nintendo-and-amazon-but-neither-side-is-talking).

*Okay, enough with the praise.*

This thing sucks.
-----------------

The 21.co ""computer"" certainly deserves a place in the VC world, along with the other products consisting of wild promises and inane use cases. For the price of [4 Raspberry Pi computer kits](http://www.alliedelec.com/adafruit-industries-2125/70460874/), you get the following:

 * [A Raspberry Pi.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) You can do a lot with this. One thing you can't do, however, is reliably run a Bitcoin node: the single gigabyte of RAM gets crowded with the bitcoin memory pool (normally up to 100 megabytes, or more when a ""stress test"" is taking place).
 * [A 128 GB micro-SD card.](https://www.sandisk.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2014/sandisk-introduces-worlds-highest-capacity-microsdxc-memory-card-at-128gb) Used to store the block chain, which is about 32 gigabytes in size right now, and growing at about 144 megabytes per day. Unfortunately, the copy of the block chain 21 Inc. includes is obsolete the second they ship the product, so you have to wait a few hours for the block chain to synchronize. This uses those valuable limited write cycles you have on your SD card.
 * [A compatible WiFi adapter.](http://www.alliedelec.com/raspberry-pi-wifi-adaptor/70670777/) Internet bandwidth ought not to be a problem, as long as no ""stress test"" is taking place: the Bitcoin development team can't decide if 14 kilobits per second is [too much](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-November/011725.html) or [not enough](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinXT).

*(If you have a remote desire to develop applications that use bitcoin, stop here. Go through that list and buy just those items above. You don't need anything else. If you're looking for comedy, or if you're a sucker with too much money, read on...)*

Is that all I get for my money?
-------------------------------

Those products alone don't allow you to make Bitcoin applications, apparently. You need these things, too:

 * [An ASIC chip and a giant fan.](https://assets.21.co/learn/content/topics/introduction-to-the-21-bitcoin-computer/introduction-to-the-21-bitcoin-computer-400-hover.jpg) Bitcoin mining hardware has a propensity for running hot, so you need a fan. Unfortunately, the Raspberry Pi can't power those two items. The Pi uses a standard 5 volt mini-USB connector for power, and draws at most 2 amps. **The fan alone uses three times the maximum current that the Raspberry Pi can handle.** Also, a tiny fan like this emits lots of noise, so you may want to include some earplugs in your Amazon.com shopping cart. Free up another outlet for you to use, because there are two power supplies!
 * [A software API that's basically a copy of another API.](https://21.co/learn/21-command-line-interface/) The API is based on software written by the developers who run Blockchain.info, a site that once famously wrote [a random-number generator that always gave the number 302](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/crypto-flaws-in-blockchain-android-app-sent-bitcoins-to-the-wrong-address/). Apart from some very contrived ""demos"", this is useless.

How about the software demos?
-----------------------------

It's difficult to justify developing a $400 computer that can't do much. So, to entice some customers, 21 Inc. included demos that try *really hard* to make customers feel inspired. Here are just a few things that 21 Inc. claims were totally impossible before their product existed:

 * [Web proxies, but with bitcoin!](https://21.co/learn/bitcoin-payable-http-proxy/) Gone are the days where you would pay a small fee (normally, no more than $9 per month) to access a wide array of private proxies. Now you can build your own service where you charge customers 1 cent *per request* to use a single public proxy. If that doesn't seem absurd yet, consider the following: loading this page probably used 60 requests for images, fonts, and various code to make the page work.
 * [Online SMS gateways, but with bitcoin!](https://21.co/learn/bitcoin-sms-contact/) Don't pay your phone company fifteen cents to send a single short message, and definitely don't pay a monthly fee to send unlimited messages! Be your own phone company and lure people into using your gateway. Granted, developers can use the same third-party messaging API for free, but that isn't the bitcoin way. Also, you may want to make sure you're legally a company and not an individual, just in case people want to use your message service for [sending death threats to those who defame Satoshi](http://www.buttcoinfoundation.org/business-owner-sounds-off-about-bitcoin-missionaries-trying-to-convert-him-the-flock-does-not-take-well-to-dissenting-opinions) and a few three-letter agencies charge you as being responsible.
 * [Data storage, but with bitcoin!](https://21.co/learn/bitcoin-notary-public/) With this project, you can write up to forty bytes to the world's slowest database. Enough said.

What are the real customers saying?
-----------------------------------

The packaging is slick:

&gt; [""This @21dotco computer came already opened...""](https://twitter.com/brianchoffman/status/666308388612100096)

The hardware is reliable:
 
&gt; [""...it must have lost power, which caused my SSH keys to become corrupted.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3t6nre/21_co_bitcoin_computer_and_customer_service/)

The software is revolutionary:

&gt; [""...it will be more expensive to pay for your spotify subscription via your electricity bill, but a lot of people don't care.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3t64ru/the_idea_behind_21co/cx3opxy)

I want to buy it anyway!
------------------------

Go ahead. I won't stop you. **Oh, and 21 Inc. [doesn't accept bitcoins](https://21.co/learn/faq/#why-cant-i-buy-the-21-bitcoin-computer-with-btc).**
