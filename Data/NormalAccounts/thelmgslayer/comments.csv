109,"Yeah, I am the same as your high-school self in terms of presenting to the class. My hands shake so much, making the presenting 10x worse, since I can't even read my notes that I am presenting. The fact that I am also hopped up on ADHD stimulants doesn't help, since even when alone/not presenting, my hands shake when trying to hold something.

I guess as long as you talk early on in the (school)year, then it's better than later. For example, last year in math, I maybe answered 1 question, that was all, for the 180 days in school. But last year in English, I answered a question each day or so. In math, I guess I saw it as weird if I suddenly started answering questions one day. So I stayed quiet.

I also don't learn well when seated in the middle/front of the room, I feel like everyone is staring at me ... But that's a problem I'll have to talk with the teachers about when they change seats.

The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, commonly known as the June Fourth Incident (六四事件) or '89 Democracy Movement (八九民运) in Chinese,[1] were student-led popular demonstrations in Beijing which took place in the spring of 1989 and received broad support from city residents, exposing deep splits within China's political leadership. The protests were forcibly suppressed by hardline leaders who ordered the military to enforce martial law in the country's capital.[2][3] The crackdown that initiated on June 3–4 became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre or the June 4 Massacre as troops with assault rifles and tanks inflicted casualties on unarmed civilians trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing, which students and other demonstrators had occupied for seven weeks. The number of civilian deaths has been estimated at anywhere between hundreds and thousands. The scale of military mobilization and the resulting bloodshed were unprecedented in the history of Beijing, a city with a rich tradition of popular protests in the 20th century.[4]

The Chinese government condemned the protests as a ""counter-revolutionary riot"", and has prohibited all forms of discussion or remembrance of the events since.[5][6] Because of the lack of information from China, many aspects of the events remain unknown or unconfirmed. Estimates of the death toll range from a few hundred to a few thousand.[7]

The protests were triggered in April 1989 by the death of former Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang, a liberal reformer who was deposed after losing a power struggle with hardliners over the direction of political and economic reforms.[8] University students marched and gathered in Tiananmen Square to mourn. Hu had also voiced grievances against inflation, limited career prospects, and corruption of the party elite.[9] The protesters called for government accountability, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and the restoration of workers' control over industry.[10][11] At the height of the protests, about a million people assembled in the Square.[12] Most of them were university students in Beijing.

The government initially took a conciliatory stance toward the protesters.[13] The student-led hunger strike galvanized support for the demonstrators around the country and the protests spread to 400 cities by mid-May.[14] Ultimately, China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and other party elders resolved to use force.[15] Party authorities declared martial law on May 20, and mobilized as many as 300,000 troops to Beijing.[14]

In the aftermath of the crackdown, the government conducted widespread arrests of protesters and their supporters, cracked down on other protests around China, expelled foreign journalists and strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic press. The police and internal security forces were strengthened. Officials deemed sympathetic to the protests were demoted or purged.[16] Zhao Ziyang was ousted in a party leadership reshuffle and replaced with Jiang Zemin. Political reforms were largely halted and economic reforms did not resume until Deng Xiaoping's 1992 southern tour.[17][18] The Chinese government was widely condemned internationally for the use of force against the protesters. Western governments imposed economic sanctions and arms embargoes.",2015-09-06 15:23:01+00:00,cusihop,3.0,t1_cusigu3,50.0,AskReddit

275,"Some dreams I've recorded (wrote down in dream journal):

I was in Dome and Hardhat (maps MW3). I killed an invisible guy. I jumped around the corner of hardhat and killed a guy that planted at A. 

---------------------------------------------

I started in Mission, SnD. I was using the model shotgun. I jumped off the middle of the map and got a kill. Then it switched to ping pong. We had 3 lives. I went up the backside of the map, and almost lost a life, but I survived. Then I went to an open area at bottom of hill and had some good rallies going.

---------------------------------------------

I was in a house with some friends, and I think Mr. Fern was there. Pretty chill guy. He was saying how we had to forfeit our beer before he finds it and yells at us. I was worried that he would find my beers. I found an empty bottle in my backpack and wondered who drank it. And I couldn’t find my other bottle.

---------------------------------------------

I was in bio taking a test, and I had a lot of questions left to answer. I was panicking because I couldn’t finish it all in like a minute. I asked for more time, but he kept saying finish up your last questions. It seemed like a punnett square problem. It was difficult to read the question, and the answers I had to choose from had exponents in them. I was worried that the time had flew by and the period ended too quickly.

---------------------------------------------

I saw Thor and was he was showing me how to make a hammer like his.

---------------------------------------------

Four of us are in a spot like the stoop of Lincoln Hubbard’s right before going up the hill behind the school. But the hill was not there, it was like in reverse, so it was flat. I have my guitar, gave it to a kid to play. He went to the flat area, kind of far away. Will and I are there. We have to defuse bombs. We clear the highschool, run out of the school from the science research hall and cafeteria exit. We then go to Holycross hospital and have to stop the last bomb.

---------------------------------------------

A few friends and I are at a ski mountain, only ones there. We have to do a few things before skiing though.

---------------------------------------------

A person offered me a free sample/cup of coffee drink for free. I was upset that it wasn’t black coffee.

---------------------------------------------

I was taking a personality test and my results were the same as George Washington’s.

638,"I agree with that to an extent. I listen to certain new country. Obviously, there are some songs that are autotuned like pop and such, but there are many more that are more slow moving, like here is an example, Darius Rucker, he is not that well known, yet he has country which is a mix between old and new. His song, Southern Style, [Southern Style Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89kwXDo53DA), is about old fashioned southern roots.

So, I think that it depends on how far you search in terms of the music charts. Obviously, the fast moving, pop-like songs will sell more to the teens and young adults, which outnumber the older generation. The songs that are slower will not sell as much, which is why they are not seen on charts. This creates an image of country nowadays like pop-country and such.
