Not sure how it went, but it looks good.

-----------------------------------------
Hey, so I went and bought all of the ingredients for this, just re reading the instructions. Here is the link: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/14539/prize-winning-baby-back-ribs/

Here are the instructions:

1
Preheat a gas grill for high heat, or arrange charcoal briquettes on one side of the barbeque. Lightly oil the grate.

2
In a small jar, combine cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Close the lid, and shake to mix.

3
Trim the membrane sheath from the back of each rack. Run a small, sharp knife between the membrane and each rib, and snip off the membrane as much as possible. Sprinkle as much of the rub onto both sides of the ribs as desired. To prevent the ribs from becoming too dark and spicy, do not thoroughly rub the spices into the ribs. Store the unused portion of the spice mix for future use.

4
Place aluminum foil on lower rack to capture drippings and prevent flare-ups. Lay the ribs on the top rack of the grill (away from the coals, if you're using briquettes). Reduce gas heat to low, close lid, and leave undisturbed for 1 hour. Do not lift the lid at all.

5
Brush ribs with barbecue sauce, and grill an additional 5 minutes. Serve ribs as whole rack, or cut between each rib bone and pile individually on a platter.



----------------------


So basically, I was wondering if I am supposed to flip the ribs over at any point, so half the time one side is hitting the grill, and the other side is facing the grill during the second half.",Cooking,I need help interpreting this rib recipe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/499293/i_need_help_interpreting_this_rib_recipe/

So I offer my help, and set out on a journey that begins at 6:00 pm yesterday. I first sit down, and easily come to see how the Time Machine is full, so I would have to delete some old backups. After monkeying with Finder for awhile, after many attempts to find the sparse bundle, I find it, I am able to access the old backups. So by now it is 7 pm, so we go and have dinner, while I have some old backups in trash, emptying the contents of the trash. 

The annoying thing about what I had to do was, about every 30 seconds, an alert popped up, asking if I wanted to skip an item that was in use, so this required me to sit at the computer for many hours, clicking 'SKIP' 120 times+ an hour. We decide to watch an episode of Bloodline (a great show btw), and that ends at around 9:30 pm.

My parents and sister go upstairs to sleep, but I stay up, determined to finish the task at hand.

Fast forward to around 11:00pm or so, and the old backups seem to be done erasing from the trash.... but I couldn't have been more wrong...

The files never actually deleted from the trash, (there goes 2 and a half hours of work), so I had to investigate the problem and find a solution.

I eventually come across a thread that says I need to download Clean My Mac 3, an app that focuses on deleting items efficiently. So I spend time using that, getting used to the settings and all.

I now have to go through the whole deletion process again. However, I have to stay up, to monitor the computer in case of any application failure. By now it is midnight.

I decide to sit and watch some Netflix, while running the app in the background. The problem with this app is that it takes FOREVER to delete each backup. I guess I am in it for the long haul.

By 2 am, I am done deleting around 300GB of data, or so I thought. It turns out while yes, I did delete 300 gigs, the time machine did not create free space for new backups to save to.

So, once again, I head to google for a good 30 minutes to determine what to do. I have to do some funky terminal commands, and then the space would magically open up for new data.

So, after I got the command all set up, i hit enter, and waited. This is around 2:45-3:00 am. The thing ends, and I see a headline in terminal **10GB has been cleared from a total of 300GB** by now, I am surprisingly not tired, since I have ADHD and my hyper focus has allowed me to stay focused for all this time. But while I am not tired, I sure as hell am pretty pissed off.

I figure that I should try it again, so I delete another 300GB or so, now nearing 4:30-5:00 at the end. And I go to free up some space, enter the terminal command and **9.3GB has been cleared from 300GB**. Now keep in mind, I had 120GB free at the beginning, (i needed 170GB free to upload the laptop's data), so at roughly 150GB, I was so close.

I kept going, loaded up another 300GB to delete, and now it is just around 5:00am. My dad walks downstairs, in his boxers, and I am sitting at the computer and say 'Hey Pa' which freaks him out. He is not very happy that I stayed up all night, trying to fix HIS problem (and save us money by not calling the tech guy). He starts interrogating me about if I had taken more of my ADHD meds throughout the night, and truthfully, i did not, and I also had no coffee the day, so IDK what kept me going all night. He leaves me be and goes for a run.

He gets back, around 6:15 or so, and I am making some breakfast and coffee. I decide to take my dog for a mile walk at 7:00am. I get back, and see my mom, now if my dad were like a 6 on the angry scale, my mom was a 9.1 out of 10. She got very mad, demanded I go to my room and sleep. Being how I just had a cup and a half of coffee, we both knew I wasn't going to be falling asleep soon.

My mom is still very mad at me, basically locked me in my room so I would sleep. I insist that i stayed awake for *her*, to help her solve an ongoing problem. I am not even tired yet, and it is 4:00pm as I type this line, funny huh?

**TL;DR** My ADHD caused me to focus intently on fixing a computer problem, ended up pulling an all nighter to solve a family computer issue. My mom is mad at me for trying to help, making me feel like a fuck up.",tifu,TIFU by hyper-focusing,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3jj2k6/tifu_by_hyperfocusing/
