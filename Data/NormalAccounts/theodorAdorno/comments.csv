0,"&gt;The bottom door rail being wider is an aesthetic thing, not really an engineering thing. 

The principle reason I doubt that is I set out to build a door of my own design that had uniform rails, and I found that the bottom had to be wider so that I could locate the mortise further up the stile lest gravity temp it to bust out the bottom.

Although the issue of perspective is interesting.  Really, if that's true, the stiles should gradually get larger as they go down.  It would help the illusion they're going for.  But the Statue of David uses the trick you talk about, and it is much subtler.  He doesn't make David's twice it's normal scale in relation to the body..And that is a much more extreme viewing angle.",2016-11-17 01:37:34+00:00,da3m1dp,3.0,t1_da1ldb2,111412.0,woodworking

Some other examples would be to talk about why the bottom rail on a door is wider than the rest, or how you can increase the load capacity of a beam by 100% simply by ""fixing"" the ends into the supports rather than simply resting them atop the supports.  You can identify classic engineering problems embedded in everyday woodworking, delving into the ""hows"" of the many rules of thumb.  The engineering problems to be solved in green wood working are also really interesting.  But also the dynamics of how tools interact with surfaces during working and sharpening.  There's the issues of sanding versus planing upon the surface of the wood, and which one creates stronger glue joints and why.  and on and on.

Corruption in US politics isn't a matter of keeping secrets.  Not in the normal sense, anyway.

The whole point of the sandwich line was to get the attention off of your weight and get people laughing at a witty mix of self-deprication and play-disrespect for the body-shamer kid.  When he uses the joke world wherein you get a sandwich every time you make love to his mom,  channeling it back to the present moment where he's shaming you, the only alternative is to say ""you're trying to hurt my feelings and humiliate me in front of everyone.  Sorry for the mom joke.  Please continue.""

I've actually only recently realized that most of what's going on in these situations is a weird sort of voyeurism.  When you defend yourself and try to dodge and change the subject, you engage everyone's voyeuristic faculties and they watch you do this little dance to try to avoid the inescapable humiliation.  The only thing to do is to take it right on the chin, but not just as a way to avoid it.  You call attention to the situation ""you're humiliating me in front of others.  There's nothing I can do to stop you, and the best part is you can just say ""hey, I'm just calling it as I see it"" or even better ""Im trying to get you to take better care of your health.""

They asked me how I would ever get married.  Instead of just saying ""I will not get married"" I said I would have a robot wife.  When they asked how I would kiss her metal lips, I said I would give her spongey lips)
* have a wwii tank and pet armadillo

My teen bucket list was:

* have a metal band with devoted following and dk-style lyrics
* ""travel the world""
* get married at age 27 no earlier no later
* become and engineer and build water systems in places that need it



my bucket list at age 27 was:

* cleverly deface a billboard (or destroy it)
* fly an RC blimp decorated as a cartoon missile at a president during a speech
* throw a basketball game using well-placed  pulses of light in the players' faces when they're trying to shoot
* pull off any major media stunt that calls attention to an important issue

My current bucket list is more like:

* build a successful cooperative enterprise
* help organize a successful strike with police union solidarity 
* organize a protected historic district
* teach kids to build 
* design and build a church
* design and build a cabin
* design and build a house
* build traditional doors and windows
* restore a model t truck and drive it as a work truck ( low top speed will not be a problem in my city due to traffic)
* write a mass in plainsong
* never leave my city, and know everyone in my neighborhood personally
* organize a highly engaged, involved and active neighborhood
* drive a wwii tank
* own an ak
* do finish carpentry for a luxury spaceship

What I have noticed:  

* The horizontal bracing on those covered walkway posts is not the diagonal kind I have encountered in the West of the US.
* the the building on the right middle of the image is being framed out and it is being done in balloon framing, which places it after about 1830, and supports it being an American boomtown.
* the photographic method places it between about 1841 and 1858. (are you sure it's a daguerotype?  If so the decorative frame makes it likely American or English)
*  The palm tree is not a species I recognize (at least not from that image.)  Perhaps someone in r/botany will be able to point you in the right direction.

Except for the Palm tree it could be San Francisco during the Gold Rush (1848-1855 would place it right in the middle of the daguerreotype era).  But those shanties are so exotic to my eyes.  Still, I can't rule out SF.  California has hills just like those, and harbors where boats can come in just like that.

103,"We have reached the point with the dovetail that the Romans finally reached with the arch in the latter period of the empire (they hid it behing greek style post-and lintel architecture for years in non-utilitarian projects).  The dovetail is no longer merely a utilitarian feature to be hidden by more acceptably classical forms.  It is itself a classical form worth showing off.  It's a good development, and a LONG overdue one, at that.

That being said,  I think we execute all of our joints with a bit too much pedantry.  There are examples of medieval joinery that survive to this day that  when you examine the insides of the joints, they are often roughly but thoroughly executed, with rather wide tolerances.  Often the design takes this into account, or the pieced had to be supplemented with iron strap repairs somewhere along the line.  On the one hand we have the jigs and tools to do better, but on the other hand we don't really have the time (well, I don't).  So I think we have the perfect excuse to let the appropriate speed at which we execute a joint dictate the degree of fine execution with which we work.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with executing perfect joints, only that there is something to be said for executing several useful projects with honest roughness rather than one single project you fuss over endlessly.  Chop chop chop away at mortises until you can cut a deep one square and deep.  If you find that your work requires and or allows for a finer degree of execution, then by all means, make the sides of the mortise and your dovetails perfectly smooth.

117,"&gt;Honestly though, I kinda disagree. Joinery like this is accessible for anyone today - those who appreciate it can learn to do it on their own, while rich people are usually the first in line for beautifully crafted works.

it looks like we agree on my main point that being surrounded at home with the fruits of well-honed crafts of your neighbors is yet another privilege our society rations strictly by wealth and class.  If a factory worker decided to learn a craft on the side, she would have a level of mastery corresponding to the amount of time she were able to devote to mastery.  Were she not shackled to a 9-5, she would reach mastery in a much shorter timeframe.  But even forgetting mastery, she would have more time to enjoy what she loves to do and reach her full potential.

I wanted to challenge your point about debauchery and similar hobbies because in my experience and that of many I know, these are a makeshift, a stand in for features of well-lived lives.  It gives one somehing like the same feeling of abandon and joy engendered by immersion in ones craft, but without the feeling of service.  And this, I claim, is also what separates craft from hobby.

What I'm saying can be boiled down to the following, like any craft, the fully-realized craft of joinery of wood is impossible without a measure of cultural joinery both in terms of transmission of the knowledge of the craft (and the bonds that feedback in those arrangements), but also in that feeling of service to the greater good, and the feeling of belonging to a larger whole by practice of your craft.

And that last fact would bring perhaps the deepest feeling of kinship and joy to the beholder.

""Mutiny is the only salvation for the Pequod's crew, and it is our only salvation.  But moral cowardice turns us into hostages.

Politicians, corporations, the public relations industry, the entertainment industry and our ridiculous television pundits speak as if we can continue to build a society based on limitless growth, profligate consumption and fossil fuel. They feed the collective mania for hope at the expense of truth. Their public vision is self-delusional, a form of collective psychosis. The corporate state, meanwhile, is preparing privately for the world it knows is actually coming.

Moby Dick rams and sinks the Pequod. The waves swallow up Ahab and all who followed him, except one. A vortex formed by the ship’s descent collapses, “and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.”

As the planet begins to convulse with fury, as the senseless greed of limitless capitalist expansion implodes the global economy, as our civil liberties are eviscerated in the name of national security, shackling us to an interconnected security and surveillance state that stretches from Moscow to Istanbul to New York, how shall we endure and resist?""

I'll do you one better.  History is not something we can change, but the whole point of studying it is because it helps us understand the present.  The parts we don't like need to be focused on for the very reason that we are prone to overlook them.  But what I am saying is very different.  People always talk about how great everything is, and they look at people like me as ""negative"".  The thing is, I am jsut WAY more positive than they can even fathom.

Could it have come faster?  I think so.

Even chaos AD ended up mostly incoherent with the notable exception off *Biotech is Godzilla* which it turns out was written by Jello Biafra.  I guess some of Jello's more metal projects are what I'm looking for, but the thing about Jello is he could never be seriously metal.  he's a smart ass punker through and through.

Metallica's *disposable heroes* was pretty good, and the *justice* album had some gems.  But it's all mostly poetry about ""power wolves"" and getting crushed by the ""hammer of justice"".

I guess it's a hallmark of the the metal genre to speak more generally about these matters, but I think they mostly betray a lack of a coherent world view beyond ""somehing is fucked up"".

That's why Maiden is so important for songs like ""childhood's end"" and ""be quick or be dead"".

As I've grown older I've realized that their best album opening song is actually  Be Quick or Be Dead.  For one simple reason, it's one of few metal tracks that doesn't go completely off the tracks lyrically when tackling some aspect social justice.  ""Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers"".

""The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says must vote for what you want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright

Clinton was the most successful at cutting welfare and ramming through job-killing globalization and financialization of the economy (glass stegal etc).

Totally agree on worker controlled workplaces being the answer, and this brings me to my point about republicans.

The obstacles in front of his voters.  Remember that itinerant students and the young more generally have a harder time than other groups overcoming the many informational, infrastructural, and psychological barriers to registration and voting.  Some of those barriers are just a natural part of being young and not having your shit together, but this combines with the common barriers to depress youth turnout.

Example, I am very engaged and informed, but I nonetheless almost did not get to vote.  In many past elections I outright failed.  When i was in school and working I was simple too overwhelmed to even know a what day the primary was happening on in my state.  I did not have a permanent address, I was living out of state half of the time, not knowing which one to register in... in short, being that I was so overwhelmed, it was really tempting to believe everyone else would vote, and that I did not have to.",2016-06-22 08:44:21+00:00,d4j5lj8,3.0,t1_d4j0o1r,13881.0,SandersForPresident

292,"Thanks.  It's a heavy burden which I often rebel against :)  (..by not being that smart)

On your point;  I see this pendulum political model at work all the time.  ""the pendulum is swinging back to the (right/left)"".  Assigning a simple direction to class struggle is the most efficient way of neutering critique.

I've found that I can even open up ostensible libertarians by way of using language of ""wealth concentration"" and ""efficient resource allocation"".  It's all about flavor for these guys.  The upside of the symbolic level at which dominant narratives operate is that the substantive level is left largely unpolluted.  So what I do is re-appropriate libertarian symbols for use in legacy libertarian critique of capitalism.

Here are some typical kinds of instruments I use.  Basically ripping off the Graeber and Chomsky I find most useful for talking to ""righties"".

""Capitalism is holding back markets.""  

""The state is a conduit for power.  That's why its gibberish to talk about the ""power of the state"".  Eliminate the state tomorrow, and concentrated wealth/power will exert itself through something like a state, or spontaneously create a new state.  The goal of libertarianism is to eliminate concentrations of concentrated wealth and power which comprise coercive state power.""

You used ""traditional power structures"" the way I use ""concentrated wealth and concentrated power"".   I think they can be used interchangeably, for the most part...maybe not, but I like to reserve words like ""tradition"" for use as one of the victims because it helps me problematize the ""right wing"" schema.",2016-06-12 18:44:13+00:00,d46a7n8,5.0,t1_d45ht2w,63827.0,SandersForPresident

BUT then I realized I had to leave town for work, so I had to take off work and drive to Norwalk to the county registrar to vote.  

At the county registrar yesterday, a pollworker saw my ballot as she was helping me seal it and sign it, and she started acting really weird.  My intuition started telling me she was rushing me to put the ballot in the depository for some reason.  I looked down, and noticed that I had not dated next to my signature.  I imagine there's a bean counter that goes through the ballots discarding those that are missing signatures.  A signature without a date probably doesn't count as a signature, and so, my ballot would have been chucked.

When  I think about all of the things that had to go right for me to vote, it starts to make sense that turnout is under 12%.

You can make the rain and run the business and he can plug away.  You can either hire him as an employee, or he can be a partner in the corporation.  I think the latter is called a joint venture.  I've spoken to contractors who have gone into this arrangement with developers, and I know the owner of a restoration company who hires licensed contractors as employees.  They join him in droves because as a group they are horrible businessmen, and he keeps them busy and pays well.

426,"&gt;No idea how you get 12-15 million people in a walkable, single-story town. The word ""city"" isn't confusing when it's being used to describe the second largest grouping of people in an urban area in the United States. It's apt.

LA doesn't really work as a city. It's more useful to think of it as a confederation of neighborhoods with a corrupt city hall.  Once we embrace that reality, we can abandon the folley of trying to plan it like a city, and plan it for what it actually is, what it has always been to varrying degrees of success.

I'm sad that you think the answer to a lack of commercial rent control is letting a Walmart (or its pale imitators) raid the neighborhood.  There's no way that didn't cause pangs of conscience as you uttered it.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  Besides, you've got affordable groceries coming out your ears in HP.  Good God.  I think you have el super and another mega Latin mini chain on york alone.  On fig you've got nothin.  That nice, shuttered, brick city-owned building on the corner of fig and fiftysomething would be perfect for a grocery store..or that space where that beauty supply money laundering operation recently took residence after giving the building a horribly tacky face lift.

This Target we are talking about was certainly the result of a shady back room deal.  That's how the neighborhood got that judgement against them.  The fact that no one has money for nice things, but only wreched makeshifts of them is certainly the result of back room deals. As ownership becomes more and more concentrated, more and more people will only be able to afford to shop at the walmarts among us.  this is a trend to be fought.  They don't need your support.  

We should look to the past for inspiration in building a future that is congruent with how LAs neighborhoods were built.  A past where one could open a store on a commercial strip rather than wait for your corporate overlords to save you.  A past where every neighborhood was somehow walkable eventhough there were no highrises or ugly apartments.",2016-05-05 15:41:00+00:00,d2twi3p,6.0,t1_d2tlz3q,20985.0,LosAngeles

432,"&gt;In Highland Park you have 2 strips of retail. If it were denser you'd have more strips, more corner shops, more cafes. Some people wouldn't have to walk 10 or 15 blocks to get to a shop or a cafe - and instead choose to drive. That would be unheard of in Paris.

First of all, highland park has a third, smaller commercial strip on monte vista and the beginnings of one on ave 50.  The smaller streets did used to have corner shops. I used to live on a smaller street where I was walking distance from two such shops as well as the main strips.  All that with charming 120-year-old, 2-story development.

Yeah, you could bulldoze it all and make it even more walkable, but there's just one problem:  the people who live there like it more or less the way it is and I promise none of them want a target anywhere near their home.

First off, I highly doubt that.  Second, Okay.  So what?  You act like that would tell us something.   If I ran out of space on my property, I would maybe start improving existing buildings, or buy another lot.  There's no reason development has to occur in the same place that's already built.  

&gt;other cities show that vertical growth is the way to limit street traffic and expand amenities like public transportation while accommodating for the constant steady population growth forecasted for LA.

Listen to you.  It's ""the"" way.  No it's not.  There are plenty of functioning walkable single-story towns and have been since the beginning of time.  The word ""city"" is confusing you.  LA used to be a loose amalgamation of functioning, walkable neighborhoods like Highland Park.

I'm thinking of having kids too, so I can start a conversation about the cost of childcare, inadequate pay, no maternal paid leave etc etc, and everything else that affects the shit out of us.  From there converting them to Bernie is trivial.

The same can be done for anyone you know who is affected by not being rich.

I also like the idea of a mortise that traverses the grain in a direction that will make the most use of the shrinking.  I think that means chopping toward the center of the tree, radially with respect to the growth rings rather than tangentially.  If I don't have full rings in a mortise member, I orient the outside of the tree with the tip of the tenon to maximize the grip away from the shoulder creating more stability across the joint.  If I do have full rings, I know i'll have equal grip at either end of the tenon, so I don't worry about it.

But I am not convinced this is any better than going parallel to the rings because if you do go parallel, you can take advantage of the tendency of the mortise to become curved as it dries.  If you stick a tenon that will dry a little to the right into a mortise that will dry a little to the left, you might end up with more stability overall.  I don't know.  I am testing all these possibilities with scrap.

I read that japanese temple builders take note of which way the tree was facing in nature before cutting it down so that they can preserve that orientation when building it.  I believe this would help with long term stability because the tree has established a certain relationship with the heat of the sun and the elements.

Hi, Is [VOTER’S NAME] there?  My name is [YOUR NAME], I’m a volunteer with Senator Bernie Sanders’ Presidential Campaign. 
 
I’m supporting Bernie because for over 30 years he has been standing up for regular people, not the billionaires.

1 - Strong Bernie
2 - Lean Bernie
3 - Undecided
4 - Lean Clinton
5 - Strong Clinton
6 – Other/Not Voting/Already Voted

IF 1 or 2:
That’s great! We have active volunteer groups all over the state and we need your help identifying supporters in your area. Can we count on you to join us and volunteer for Bernie?

IF NO TO VOL:  Thats ok.  Thanks again for committing to support Bernie on March 15th.  Together we can win! Have a great rest of your day! [END CALL]
 
IF 3:
I fully understand being undecided, you still have time but its close. I hope you will vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders. He has consistently opposed job-killing trade deals in stark contrast to Sec. Clinton’s support of outsourcing American jobs to low-wage countries. Sen. Sanders believes we need to uplift working Americans by raising the minimum wage, ensuring equal pay for women, and expanding social security. He is the president we need to ensure that all Americans earn what they truly deserve.

You can find where Senator Sanders stands on other issues important to you at berniesanders.com. Have a great day and thanks for your time! [END CALL]

931,"I've studied police unions at length.  i think it's a clear cut case of having no vision.  Just look at the NYPD guy.  Patrolmen hate enforcement policy handed down to them from management.  The directives they receive from city management expose officers to legal and personal risk, and the ridiculously union appears unaware that it has a chance to change that.

A great example of this was during the occupy protests.  You could read at the Police Union's own website that the enforcement approach the city took towards the protests was hurting morale.

There was also the spectacle of the breaking of the Camden police union, and the police joining the occupation of the Wisconsin Capitol occupation.

Anyway, my research led me to conclude that national police labor leadership over-learned the lesson from the 1919 Boston strike (they still cite it as proof that they could never cooperate with the large labor movement again).  The laws and the country have changed since then.  The police unions are at the height of their strength.  They should wrest enforcement policy away from management.  What does this mean?  It means change those base policies like stop and frisk, and theatrics Union which performance is evaluated.

In all seriousness, I tend to agree with your reality-informed view.  But something is afoot.  I am seeing insane amounts of engagement from people who were never engaged before.  The cultural pieces have been falling into place for a while now, and I believe we are in for a sea change to the status quo very soon.  If this isn't it, it will be just another bundle of straws on the buckling camel's back.

The narrative of the 1% became common, and income inequality became a permanent part of the pop media frame and dinner table talk.  Socialism is more favorable than capitalism.  A number of important economic papers from LSE and elsewhere have been published and widely publicized explaining key faults of today's market economies (I know no one reads them, but they were reported on, and likely contribute to some public elites breaking ranks).  Obama failed to ""change"" anything, leading to critical and deep disillusionment.  Bill Gates recently said only socialism can save us.  The Pope.

I feel like there is a confluence of cultural phenomena setting the stage for what we are seeing unfold right now.  At the very least the old tricks appear to be losing their fail-safety.",2016-02-13 03:14:49+00:00,czy4380,6.0,t1_czy0c9f,7260.0,SandersForPresident

I still hold out hope someone like you and someone like me can have a sane conversation about this without exploding.  Want to try?

I find the conversations I have to be highly contingent on threshold matters that are never covered by anyone in the discussion.  For example, I have this conversation with my brother often.  He is pro nuclear, and his arguments usually assume that reducing energy consumption is a non-starter.    Now if *even temporary* reduction in consumption really is a nonstarter, then yes, I agree.  Let's go France's route.

My problem is we never even explore the feasibility of consumption reduction, it's just off limits.

Now, more to the point, how are you not moved by the fact that clean-energy sources met 27.7 percent of Germany’s demand in the nine months through September.  Canada, Brazil and Norway all produce all of their electricity with clean sources.

Now I know what you are thinking, those cold countries could use electric heaters instead of coal to heat their homes if they would only adopt nuclear.  To that I must just ask, what about that time-honored renewable resource called trees?  They burn incompletely so you are always sequestering some carbon overall by using wood as fuel…as long as you cut it by hand!

I wish the pundits would just highlight this more, because that really is the choice, and both candidates not only agree that is the choice, but they agree on who would do what.

Most politicians (eg. Clinton) love to treat the symptoms because there are more credit-claiming opportunities that way.  Treating the roots eliminates credit-claiming opportunities, and is harder to do, by definition.  What's interesting about this particular root is it is more exciting to talk about than all of the individual symptomatic problems, and in addition people have recently become better able to connect the dots between, say, income inequality and symptomatic injustices.  Another sea change that has occurred is that less people think they are going to be rich some day, so the class warfare being waged against them is now laid bare for the viewing, unobscured by childish illusions.

Hillary was clearly checking boxes off a list of things she needed to say on that stage in order to make requisite impressions on key voter blocs.  Her strategists have done the math, and all she has to do is stick to the script in order to win.

She was ecstatic that the young people were all going for Bernie Sanders event hough the establishment is trying to sell them Hillary.  I chimed in that Bernie's policies are strikingly similar to Ike's, and that is why the corporate establishment is attacking him.

992,"Hillary has been doing a great job of applying the Luntz doctrine.  Supporters of a candidate are generally aware of, and forgiving of their candidates weaknesses.  So you don't waste time attacking their weaknesses.  **You attack their strengths.**  If you call their strengths into questions, their supporters start to wonder if they have any untouchable strengths, or if they only have weaknesses.  
   If Bernie trades on not running a negative campaign, you call it ""a subtle smear campaign"" and you challenge him to ""come out and say it to your face"".  If Bernie's strength is that his is the anti-corporate guy, you poke holes in that.  And so on and so on.  
   What I am wondering is, what would it look like to attack Hillary's perceived strengths?  This is hard to do, because most of us think like working people, so from our perspective it is easy to see that a lifelong corporate opportunist has no strengths.  But what if we thought like elites, and mainstream Manhattan democrats?  What are her perceived strengths to them?
   She will protect their privilege, and can be trusted not to institute or agitate for more efficient wealth allocation in the economy.  With this in mind, we can begin to see what a Luntz type strategy against Clinton might look like.  Essentially, the message would have to get out to these lovers of the status quo that she will actually harm the status quo, she will lead to instability and her policies will lead to an erosion of their privilege.  This isn't as hard to do as it sounds.  Afterall, there is plenty of evidence that weaker-than-is-possible broad purchasing power as a result of insane wealth concentration and a lack of investment due to the consequent poor consumption will lead to overall lower growth, for example.

WHAT?!  Berne's biggest under-promoted feature is that he is best for down-ticket due to higher turnout!

I have been wondering how every Democrat mayor, governor, etc etc isn't wholeheartedly and publicly supporting their obvious savior.  I mean, it requires *no* idealism whatsoever to support Bernie if you are a democrat running for any office.  It is cold hard shrewd political reality that higher democrat turnout helps down-ticket democrats.  The threat of retaliation from the Clinton machine does not explain the mysterious lack of political good old-fashioned self-interest, here.

It is my hunch that a Luntzian initiative has been initiated to misinform down-ticket Democrats on this.  I mean, even if you believe that there just aren't enough democrats facing a serious challenge, there is evidence that Bernie will be better in midterms.  With 2010 fresh in their memory, the Democrat establishment's behavior is a bit of a mystery to me.

My whole life I have fought the notion that democrats just don't want to win too badly, because they need to be able to preserve the status quo and keep enough republicans around that they have an excuse for those of us who expect them to alter the status quo.

1073,"&gt;This so much... I used to call myself pro-business, but I just can't stand industry giants bullying, bribing and legislating their way into monopolies and bailouts while small business owners (and employees!) struggle to survive. If a completely ""free market"" means allowing wealth to black-hole itself into infinite density, then it's a failed policy as far as I'm concerned, because monopolies destroy market freedom.

Well said.

A little off topic, but I am fascinated with the reality behind words we use like libertarian, republican, conservative, democrat etc etc.

Welfare is considered socialist, but it is just privatization of wealth.  If I instituted land reforms whereby I distributed all public property to all citizens, would that be a socialist move or a libertarian move?  I read that this was once a republican proposal for what to do with public land.

Today, the republican party is the same, only they have added to their principles the preservation of privilege when it comes to the allocation of resources.

Reading the history of the republican party is a fascinating thing to do.

1085,"jeez.  I think I didn't make myself clear.

I'm wondering why downticket dems aren't supportinf Bernie since he is clearly better for them due to increased turnout.  The one dogma of politics is that politicians are single-minded seekers of re-election.  If that is true, we need to account for when they don't act like it.

I think many democrats in congress dont really give a shit about us, and I think these democrats like being able to blame republicans when these democrats fail over and over again to disrupt a harmful status quo.  The reason they do this could be any number of things.  Maybe they don't want to risk a challenge in the next election.  Maybe they don't want to hurt their funders.  Maybe they personally *like* the status quo

Bernie would be a boon to any other democrat on the ballot (governors, senators, mayors, you name it) who is facing a republican challenge since he will turn people out more. And he will probably be better than any dem pres has ever been in mid-terms.  So we need to ask ourselves this question very seriously:

IF BERNIE WILL BETTER INCREASE EVERY DEMOCRAT'S TURNOUT THAN HILLARY, WHY ARENT THOSE DEMOCRATS SUPPORTING HIM???

We need at least a theory for why this should be.  I like mine.  No one else seems to be advancing one.

Maybe no one has examined this to them.  Maybe their fear of the hillary machine is greater than their need to be elected.  I don't know, but we can't just ignore this apparent anomaly.

I have spoken to the cslb and the department of industrial relations, and they seem to prefer the union apprenticeship route.  The only problem there is that union work is of an exclusively new construction and commercial nature.  Why would I apprentice doing work that bears so little a resemblance to the kind of work I will be doing?

well, the answer, it seems, is that I will do so because the supplemental classes are free, and I get priority registration and they are easily applied toward the displacement of required experience such that going the union route I can be sure to be done in as little time as possible.

That is, unless you know a quicker route...

Also, apparently homeowners can hire employees to help them...  That seems like a hell of a loop hole as well (although the calb takes pains to warn owners not to deal with unlicensed people trying to convince them to do the work as owners and hire the unlicensed person.)

Look, you may get lucky and your red wings will fit perfectly (not that anyone even knows what that means), but in my experience, they play fast and loose with sizing at the stores.  They also probably will not have your closest size in the style you want.  If they do happen to have the style and size you want, it will still never fit as well as Whites, which are made to your foot size.  Red Wing realizes their vulnerability in this, so they have a pathetic garauntee where they will let you have two boots of different pre-made sizes for each foot if you want.

1113,"&gt;In his time, one of the biggest barriers to class mobility was the astronomical costs of education. Sending a child through university cost more than a century of working class income, even the elite class had to start a fund at the birth of a male child in order to afford the best schools. Education beyond the basics was really a privilege for the wealthiest families of the nation.

This plays interestingly with this quote from Morris:

""A superstition still remains from the times when 'education' was a rarity that it is a means for earning a superior livelihood; but as soon as it has ceased to be a rarity, competition takes care that education shall not raise wages; that general education shall be worth nothing, and that special education shall be worth just no more than a tolerable return on the money and time spent in acquiring it; and, mind you, such special education must be very carefully directed towards the one aim of commercial success in the speciality, or it will miss, and be thrown into the mass of general education which earns nothing.""

&gt;I see the company as both a product and an agent of the instant gratification society we live in.

At their scale, they are a product and agent in every realm they touch.  For example, I think that if we looked for examples that they are overall agents of wealth concentration, both in their business operations and in their contribution to the advisement of those entrusted with the authorship of policy favoring wealth concentration.  Now I don't have examples of this ready, but I do know what I would be obligated to do if I were an IKEA planner.  I would be working to make use of and expand industrial policies favoring my firm, preferably to the exclusion of my competitors.  I would additionally be obligated to be working on erection of barriers of entry to competitors and other innovations designed to lock out competition.

This is the sort of thing they teach you to do at elite business schools, I'm told.

But they are, as you say, a product, and I would say primarily and doubly so.  The first way is obvious.  As the cliche goes, they are a product of the system.  The second way is more radical.  Even in their agency they are a product of the system.  The legal and other structures comprising what passes for some semblance of a market system heavily rewards anti-market activity.

I think that if people knew what percentage of the opposition's money we are looking to raise (preferably %100) it would help people.  Im thinking something like:

Our opponents have $x and an additional $w in estimated super pac moneys.  For us to raise $x + $w, 50% of likely donors would need to contribute $c (per T).

This would eliminate the sense that no matter what we do we will be eventually wiped out by an ocean of political spending.

If the numbers are so grim that we don't want to share them, that is no excuse since not talking about them automatically creates this sense.

Just think of how much demand for the products of local firms has been lost to wealth-concentrating mega-firms like ikea.  Not just in furniture, but in everything.

Labor-eliminating firms reduce both prices and purchasing power.  The result is that fewer and fewer people can afford anything but the types of products that must diminish purchasing power.

The most odious aspect of all of this is that the business models of such firms live and die off one or another form of public subsidy, which due to their scale, they can make disproportionate use of, and advise trade planners on its continuance and expansion. Take say, the 1 billion in annual fossil fuel subsidies annually.

1140,"&gt; Change rarely happens when a new idea comes about, it usually comes about when the proponents of the old idea die out or get out of the way.

In Max Planck's situation, that was definitely the case since his opponents careers depended on the validity of old ideas.  But who's career depends on the continuation of performance pay?  I think you nailed it when you said management is disconnected.  And why shouldn't they be?  After all, it's not (usually) their company.  They're hired to act on the owners behalf, an of course, they are subject to the same deleterious effects of performance pay as those they are managing.  Of course, there are always worker-owned enterprises ([this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-obHJfTaQvw) is a great and informative watch if you have the time).

Not to get too philosophical, but what the hell.  I think we are up against a very basic question.  You and I can safely enough say we are conscious as individuals, and we can probably agree most people are at least minimally conscious.  What we are going to find out very soon is if the human race *as a whole* is a conscious thing, able to respond in a coordinated and dynamic way to self-imposed threats to our survival, or if it is like any other destructive force of nature, awesome and unconscious.  And this takes us back to your hopes for the human race.  Why on earth would we want mankind to colonize another planet when they have proven through their inability to sustainably inhabit Earth, that they are no more conscious than a stone?

I want to make sure I'm making sense on the matter of consciousness.  If we cannot stop ourselves from destroying the habitability of our only planet, we cannot be said to be conscious.  Of course, this is more or less settled in everyone's mind already whether they know it or not.  You see it when you propose substantive changes to the way resources are allocated.  Whenever someone says ""that ain't gonna happen"", they are admitting we are not conscious and that we deserve to die out, and that we do not deserve another planet.  So you see, people like you and me, who might still harbor some commitment to the idea of a conscious human race, have quite a task ahead of us.",2015-12-24 11:35:50+00:00,cy9y7fr,13.0,t1_cy9x5kv,4682.0,woodworking

1157,"&gt;That is a stunning quote. I feel divided, I love science and believe humanity needs to colonize to other planets ASAP, however I view many 'advances' as overall lowering the quality of life. If we could keep medicine and science, but find a way to balance that and turn our cities and towns into small farming, self sustaining communities... I think we would find utopia. No more death from childbirth, but no cubicle farms, no polluted skyscrapers and poorly built mcmansions. 

As long as science serves primarily the needs of concentrated wealth, good science will continue to be but a byproduct of bad science.  People are still in school learning how best to detect and extract hydrocarbons from the ground.  Other people are learning how to mitigate the inevitable disasters hydrocarbon use is bringing upon us.  

Specialists are trained to solve problems created by other specialists.  

I have been deriving some hope from the following possibilities:  

*  The behavioral sciences have torpedoed the idea that people are motivated by performance pay.  The evidence shows that such motivators are more likely to *impede* performance.  The business community cannot accept this, so they keep funding more studies on it, and they keep coming to the same conclusion.
*  The inevitable unemployability of the majority of the population will simultaneously make clear to all the truth about automation oriented toward wealth concentration; it's completely unsustainable.  Afterall, what is the point of gaining production efficiency if your firm has to pay a tax to support a hefty guaranteed basic income so that former workers can maybe afford your product?  
*  Very visceral and easy-to-see, unprecedented catastrophes will be increasingly easily attributed to climate change which will be very easily seen as an extension of the same mechanisms behind the aforementioned problems.
*  If democratic structures are at all operative at this point, democratically managed economies oriented toward efficient resource allocation will be inevitable.  

I know there is a confluence of phenomena (automation, growing superfluous population, climate change, wealth concentration, bacterial resistance, nuclear threat, resource war) any one of which is catastrophic in the extreme, but the good news is that as more and more people start to feel like we are about to undergo certain catastrophe, it will be harder and harder to argue for short term stability above all.

thanks!  I am surprised!  Amazing.  So checking for pitting is really a heuristic stand-in for evaluating the general condition of the saw.  Good.  I like heuristics.

The pitted saw.  It's blade features a pattern of smooth, flush pits, like the surface of a golf ball.  What is the purpose of the pits?  Well, it's twofold.

I could not fathom that neither Clinton nor Gingrich were good guys because that would be completely insane.  How could the all wise system leave out an option that is so much better than the ones available.

In a way, all we have to say is educate on the scandal of political finance.  If those of us who get it can put ourselves in the shoes of people who don't, we might just be able to teach them at their level.

The only way I have ever broken my own loyalty towards anything is by way of something I am *more* loyal to.  We need to identify a cause which meets the following criteria:  

* Hillary fans are more deeply connected to it than they are to her
* Hillary would hurt that cause

The only one I can think of is Hillary herself, which is tempting due to it's elegance, but there must be more.  Chomsky use this trick in an Israel debate once.  He said ""I'm against Israel's Palestine policy because it is destroying Israel"". And then he had examples.

Frank Luntz said, attack their strengths, not their weaknesses.  Supporters already have whole mental mechanisms for dealing with the weakness of their hero.  They don't have the same for their hero's strengths"".  This is why relubkicans attacked Kerry's military record.

So I guess we can ask ourselves; what are her perceived strengths and how can we call them into question:

Electability
Legitimacy
Repugnican's have always attacked her
She's a woman in a mans world
She's effective
She's the establishment candidate
She has more endorsements
She's a Clinton
The democratic establishment likes her
Women's issues

Take that last one.  It may be possible to come up with numbers on just how many women were killed as a result of her Iraq vote.  But if she actually voted wrong in even one woman's issue, that could sink her.

Unfortunately I think the key to the real dead enders is a level of ubiquity and reputation thst can only be accomplished by mass media.

If you talk to people describing themselves as conservative, they will tell you the great society was the worst thing ever, and then, in the same breath, they will insincerely tell you how important it is to address poverty *instead of* trying to fix inequality.

Addressing poverty is a way of staying away from the truly dangerous issue of flattening the structure of privilege, and wealth concentration.  This is why democrats shifted focus there.  Now, with a populist wave coming, republicans are dishonestly adopting this approach.

1225,"If you are wondering what is going on in the heads of Hillary fans, I think I know.

Remember Larry David lampooning Sanders by saying ""We are all gonna die"" ?  That was the clue.

I think Hillary is exactly who you would vote for if you thought the political, economic status quo is **not** in need of fundamental, deep and substantive disruption.  If you think a few little tweaks and reforms here and there, baby steps, little by little is going to result in anything but disaster, Hillary is the person you will vote for.  If you don't see the political finance system as fundamentally flawed, you will vote for Hillary.  If you are unaware that Bernie is a moderate on the global political spectrum, you will vote for Hillary.

So the task is clear.  We don't need to talk about Hillary.  We just need to sync everyone up with the reality of the dire situation.  The key here is to remind them that of the large global and national problems converging on us at the moment, *any one* of them is capable of causing major disruptions if inadequate responses continue.  In other words, take your pick; controlled disruption or uncontrolled disruption.  Fail to get money out of politics and nothing else will go right.  Fail to radically disrupt the energy status quo, and you will end up with far worse disruptions.  Fail to disrupt the displacement of workers by rapid and accelerating automation and offshoring, and you will have a major disruption.  Keep letting wealth concentrate into fewer and fewer hands and you will have a major depression.  Keep letting banks get bigger than they were before the last crash, and they will crash even bigger next time.  We haven't even gotten to antibiotic resistance yet.

Kill the complacency.

I remember when I was a Bill Clinton supporter.  I sort of peripherally knew there were people on the left who thought he was conservative, and I knew they were talking about things I knew nothing about, but I just thought ""could the democratic establishment be wrong and these punks be right?"".  It was all about legitimacy.  All I cared about was the 'D' team beating the 'R' team.  It was like sports.  I saw no connection between the policies and the candidates.  Clinton was the good guy and the republicans were the bad guys, and that was that.

Now, for a certain core of her supporters, I think this is about seeing her finally win.  It is about closure in a media soap opera dating back to the early 90s.  Every time they see her aging face, they are reminded of the saga, and they know they have to vote for her to show the republicans that they can't keep her down.  This is some very basic emotional thinking, but basically, they care about her feelings. They want her to win for her own sake.  They want her to experience joy.  I think one way to combat it would be to make them afraid of a terrible and humiliating failure.  That failure has actually already occurred, but if Hillary debates Trump, something very terrible could happen to her.  Not only is there a possibility that she could lose, but the idea of her could die.  Just think of it.  **The republican front runner takes far less corporate money than Clinton.**  Not just any republican, but the ultimate villain.  Imagine your favorite hero.  Now imagine the righteous villain exposing the hero as a fraud for all the world to see, and then defeating the hero.  Trump will eviscerate her and humiliate her with this fact, and worse, he will do it in his particular way.

&gt;tight budget  

Here, I claim, is the secret to getting by on a few tools until you can tool up:  
*Don't design something that requires tools you don't have.*

If all you have is one good, half-inch chisel, you will design things differently than if you have a full arsenal.  The same goes for every tool, I claim.

You really can take this to as far of an extreme as you like, you just have a harder time in specific situations, and you will have to be sharpening more often, which apparently isn't as time consuming as people think.  

Here's another completely untested idea I am inexplicably confident about:  
*A single bow saw, 10 tpi with a progressive rip cut pattern can do almost everything.*  You can tighten it as much as you want, so there is no need for a back.  Since there is no back, you can cut panels with it.  The only drawback I can think of is that regular saws have that broad blade which leans up against the sides of the kerf, and helps keep you square.  Also, the broad metal might dissipate heat more efficiently, which can stop the saw from seizing up.  On the other hand, there is less metal to cause friction in the kerf.  That is why you will be so thankful when you finally get those other saws.

Alternatively, you can probably get by with a single crosscut panel saw and a 14-inch carcass saw with the same progressive rip cut pattern.

Anyway.  Not my idea.  https://youtu.be/UA5DixEaaUo?t=3m25s


Get a perfect combination square.  A cheap try square ruined my life once, so I don't mess around with cheap measuring tools.  

A single set of 6 to 8-inch dividers greatly simplify layout and measuring, and due to their nature, they don't need to be expensive, they just need to be lockable and rigid.

Amazing.  I am overjoyed that we are talking.  I now trust that you will hear me out because you did something no one ever does.  You asked me to explain something.  Very rare on the Internet and increasingly in what passes for personal discourse.  I also appreciate your bravery for saying the status quo does not need to be disrupted.  This shows that you care enough about genuine engagement that you might actually be eager to hear whether or not I have a real case here, or if I'm just another outraged faction who thinks the sky is falling because my little vision of what should be isn't anywhere near being the case.

You can trust I will hear you out as well.  I will also be as charitable as possible to overcome any in congruence in our respective parlance (a problem often leading people to dismiss each other.)

First, FDR was the best president our system was capable of producing at the time he emerged.  (Obama was the best president this system could produce when he was elected.).   It was already clear that the rule-by-owners form of government with multiple guards against democracy which the framers specified, was not only destroying the lives of workers but it was also leading to its own demise.  The right was digging in its heels to continue more of the same.  Most people were ready for utter revolution.  (In fact, they had undergone several revolutions by then.  Not only were people's lives severely disrupted by rapid expansion, land reform and industrialization, during the gilded age,   wealth had become incredibly concentrated at the top.  People were sick of losing everything and not having any hope for the future.  Revolution was definitely in the air.  ""Fortunately"" enough of the legislature knew this, and gladly supported the creation of a safety net to avoid a more substantive revolution which might disrupt the persistence of privilege and lead to guillotines or worse.

Of course, even this wasn't enough.  The collective action problems built into the legislative system and the conservative courts made sure the New Deal couldn't even make the modest reforms it needed to make to end the depression, which went on and on.  Only the war could overcome legislative collective action problems (a major fundamental flaw in our constitution), bring about policies like the famous 90% income tax, universal employment, extreme government intervention and massive wealth re-distribution.  The new deal set the stage (many experts think our morale and  performance in the war was greatly improved by the new deal), but it was crucially hampered by our constitution.  In short, our constitution succeeded at what it was designed to do; avoid ""innovation"" except perhaps in the case of disruption.  reformism failed and disruption had prevailed.  Unfortunately that disruption had to come in the form of a war.

It always seems reasonable to think we can incrementally reform our way to a more just economy and political system, but evidently our constitution is designed to make this impossible, and all the big changes to the way resources are allocated in the economy, for better or worse, have come as a result of disruptions.

The framers were clear about their intentions.  Their intentions were to protect privilege and avoid democracy.  You can read about it some in the federalist papers, but they were much more clear in the secret constitutional debates.  Here's Madison:

""In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation.""

So they placed  safeguards against democracy, many of which remain today.  Many such safeguards remain embedded deeply in the constitution.  This is why it doesn't matter who wants bernie to win (or for that matter who wanted Gore to win).  You or I don't vote for presidents or nominees, a special class of insiders does that for us.  And for all their fear of the plebes seizing power by democratic means and instituting land reforms, the framers apparently completely neglected to place constraints on concentrated wealth's influence on the political system.  And that, my friend, is some bullshit.  

These precautions are also why the reforms we try to make get so watered down in committee of they don't get killed outright, that we can literally count the number of good, substantive policies that have passed congress in our lifetime on 1 hand.  And even these major acts of congress are paltry makeshifts and half measures.  Obamacare was gutted and coopted by insurance.  The stimulus act was weak due mostly to obstruction. (China's stimulus dwarfed ours).  The civil rights act certainly *helped*, but it left the source of the problems untouched because it left poverty untouched, and poverty is concentrated by race.  Even after our banking system almost caused Armageddon, the legislation we were able to pass was completely foiled by collective action problems (our buddy Dodd-Frank)

We are going to have several disruptions in the near future.  Automation, climate change, accelerated viral and bacterial mutation.  There are now several issues requiring an organized response,  any one of which would be a fundamental problem.  Our political system is simply not responsive enough to deal with these problems in a timely enough fashion.  This used to be an asset, but these new problems will quickly metastasize to an inoperable point unless substantive, deep, organized and sharp action is taken.  Our political system is designed to fail at solving these types of issues, and the market has proven incapable of anything but exacerbation.  Even Bill Gates is admitting only socialism can save us now.

The time for reformism, I humbly submit, has passed.  Disruptions are  coming, and to meet them appropriate, we need to disrupt the obstacles in our way to responding to them.

I will hope, as I did for Obama, that Hillary knows what needs to happen, and she will be a real leader when she gets in.

I never fell for Obama.  I wanted to, and I was encouraged that he had an organizing past, but I looked at his actions, and I had a general historical political model to place his actions in context. I knew that what we needed after Bush, and with the economy crumbling, with a large and growing superfluous working age population, many of whom sit in jail, was something more like FDR, and less like Obama. His legislative actions backed up what he said he would do for anyone who was paying attention to either.  He billed himself as a Reagan Democrat. And it wend beyond his labor policy to his economic and fiscal policy.  He was a status quo candidate if ever there was one.  Here's a little tidbit from his ""vision"" as I captured it february 21 2008 ""Expand the Military: We have learned from Iraq that our military needs more men and women in uniform to reduce the strain on our active force.

Again, as you pointed out, I am not a stockholder.  They have their own thoughts about such ridiculous compensation and you can read all about it in the business press if you are unaware of that controversy.  Of course non-stock holders have opinions on the matter, and they are far more qualified than I am.  You may be aware of some of the conclusions they've been arriving at in the academic literature when it comes to performance pay.

Not that I think recourse to either of the above sources should be necessary for us to become highly skeptical of the claim that anything like a commensurate change in performance is going to be seen by increasing pay from say 1million to 10 million.

&gt;A specific kind of power though. The other path is simply to reduce that power, which is that its violence is seen as legitimate and justified.

This is of course classical libertarian thought, and it is well received by me.  I just have let go of the idea that government is the only or even the primary channel of coercive power.

&gt;What's the alternative to allocation by wealth? How do you determine how much something is valued if not by signaling it with something else that is valued?

&gt;It simply requires force in defending ownership, which itself doesn't require coercion.

We can hang on to the purity of ideas like this, but we need to face the facts of the moment.  When ownership is concentrated, it is absolutely coercive, and it is not going to de-concentrate itself, especially if additional costs of concentration can be socialized.

We have reached the zero level of our conversation, I believe.  What we need at this point is to be very honest, and I think if we do, we will find we agree on the following:

Government arises spontaneously out of existing power structures.  If existing power structures are concentrated, government will reflect that.  This is why talk about ""reducing that power"" is gibberish.

&gt;What's the alternative to allocation by wealth? How do you determine how much something is valued if not by signaling it with something else that is valued?

There are other forms of value besides wealth, obviously.  Or, put another way, there are other forms of wealth.

1254,"&gt; You're not their stockholders;

Firms with outrageous pay ratios have their own stockholders to ignore on the matter of wasting tens of millions per year on CEO compensation when there are far better things to invest in than something for which metrics are so lacking.

&gt;There is definitely a degree to which government interferes in people's lives and it is not constant.

Almost certainly, and as you stated earlier, there is a vibrant market for it.  Firms invest and they expect a return in terms of government intervention.  Beyond that, they need ongoing access to lawmakers in order to maintain or steer policy in a favorable direction.  Government interference can come in the form of anything from overbalancing investor rights in legislation to socializing research costs and costs associated with industrial policy.  You can't have such a high degree of market share concentration without onerous legal barriers to entry for small firms.  Actual recourse to violence is never necessary for market concentration in practice, not that I reject that dogma.

&gt;This includes the biggest monopoly of all: the monopoly on what is seen as justified violence, held by government.

Government is a spontaneous manifestation of power.  The only path is to lessen the degree of power concentration.  Once we accept this, we can start talking about plans.  Or we can keep exchanging platitudes.

I mean that's no more relevant a test than the pennies-per-employee meme (which merely tells us how staggeringly large the firm has been able to grow as a result of conditions).  While I have my doubts as to whether every firm needs to invest in research (of course they do) research is likely *not* the only place a company can invest.


&gt;Monopolies are temporary unless shored by violence, be it private or government. The solution isn't more government.

First of all, ""More government"" cannot be a solution because it is gibberish.  The amount of governance in any given population is probably constant.  What varies is the degree to which power is concentrated and the degree to which wealth is concentrated, among other things.
Monopolies are both a cause and result of power and wealth concentration.  It seems what you mean is we need to stop rationing access to resource allocation decision-making by wealth.  It's an idea I certainly agree with, but it is not a plan.",2015-11-30 17:40:19+00:00,cxi3870,16.0,t1_cx9qzy6,656709.0,SandersForPresident
1258,"&gt;It's according to the supply of and the demand for it.

Who's demand, though?  I made reference to the ""company's demand"", but most of the company has no say whatsoever, and if they did, I promise there would not be demand for paying one idiot 10 to 30 billion dollars, for example.  There are successful firms that operate with 3:1 ratios, or even 1:1 ratios.

&gt;When you're talking about the ratio of CEO pay to the median worker, it's completely relevant to discuss how much higher the median workers pay would be with a given reduction in CEO pay.

A company can make much better use of 10 or 30 billion dollars than sinking it down the pit of CEO compensation.  This is why most employees and owners of the company in fact demand such compensation for any single employee.  Of course, the CEO is merely one employee.  I think the idea that all employees' pay, from the top to the bottom is indexed to some well known supply of skill sets is rather novel.

&gt;I don't concede that, but even if I did it still does not follow that are results are solely or chiefly due to it, because those results can manifests by other mechanisms as well.

If you have a firm that would not exist today without nanny state intervention and protection, you aren't talking about a firm that is operating in a market.  You may be able to set up little play markets inside of the firm, but they are fundamentally debased.  We are talking about firms which enjoy monopolistic market share, operating in every state, every city.  This is as a result of written rules which favor such large scale for a single firm.  It's not better for the economy at large, it may be better for the principals of the firm itself, but that doesn't mean much to you or I, or even the vast majority of the company.",2015-11-23 03:02:04+00:00,cx9qj56,14.0,t1_cx7qqbw,162786.0,SandersForPresident

And 200% is ""much"" more than 0%.  Companies hopefully pay according to their demand for the skill set, rather than how rare the skill set is, lest they hire a full time juggler.

1451,"&gt;When the planet was young, the matter would have been spread out more or less evenly, but still in a very much spherical form (because once there is enough mass, this is always the way). The center of gravity of the sphere would also have been the center of the sphere and the immense pressure from all the mass pushing inwards (or downwards if you prefer) caused the internal structure to heat up and liquefy, thus allowing the redistribution of matter along a density gradient, heaviest at the bottom (middle) and lightest at the top (outside). Make sense?

Fascinating.  Very well explained.  That is very clear to me.  I don't think I could be convinced without the planetary origin story you related.  My only point of confusion is this part:

Now, people like you or me may still refer to ourselves as libertarian and still mean what it has meant for hundreds of years, but if we talk to almost anyone else, we will see how far the term has fallen in its ability to convey what it originally meant.

For starters, how many self described libertarians today are against division of labor like Adam Smith was?  Do they fear offshoring, the way Adam Smith and David Ricardo did?  How many libertarians are as opposed to private tyranny as they are to state tyranny?  And this second question really holds the kernel for me.  In the US, you have ""libertarians"" who are worried sick about state tyranny, but they regard utterly democratically unaccountable global tyrannies as perfectly harmless, or even heroic.  Meanwhile, the only check on that latter, more stubborn tyranny is the former.  Government tyranny has a flaw; it's partially democratically accountable.  Private tyrannies are working on that, and part of the project is to reduce the one potential check on their power; the state.  They want the state as an insurance and private security policy which *helps* them accumulate an undue share of resources, and they have an army of ""libertarians"" helping achieve this very un-libertarian goal.

For example, according to dominant theories of modernization, nothing requires the destruction of tradition more than global capitalism (see Rostow, and no he's not a leftist).  Of course the resulting disruption and concentration of wealth is usually at the root of the problems over which there are pitched battles (notably, abortion).  Also, to put it crudely, if you are rich, your exposure to racist policies, sexist policies, abortion policy or what have you is highly mitigated, so these are really all issues for people in precarious economic circumstances.  If this is the case (and I believe it is not too far from it), then there may *only* be class policy.

So are the justices increasingly in favor of tradition or increasingly in favor of progress?

When people want access to the beach, and Scalia sides with property owners who block them, is he being traditional?  Maybe what happens is justices more and more reflect the will of the global corporate elite and issues that don't matter to that constituency are just superfluous.  They can vote either way.

1475,"""Organic"" is a marketing term, which is why I didn't use it.  Of course the matter is more complicated than ""organic"" versus ""GMO"".  I think its more about high-input farming.  And i don't know that we can disentangle GMOs from input intensive techniques as you've suggested.  Most GMOs are specifically optimized for use in high input monoculture farming, and to withstand the many downsides of the centralized, fossil dependent, food systems they are central to, with long, bumpy commutes, and long refrigeration and storage times.  You see, it is a two way street.  Because we can genetically engineer those downsides away, we can just heap on more downsides.  So round and round we go.  And the inefficiency is not a problem, because, as you pointed out, we can just switch to other forms of energy to prop up the food system someday, if we want to.

&gt;[Citation needed]

See Routledge International Handbook of Sustainable Development.  See Gidon Eshel et al, Jan van der Ploeg, Miguel A. Altieri to name a few.

GMO's are central to, and dependent on the high input farming methods our inefficient food system is dependent on.  And they lead to other impacts that then require more energy to clean up.

So you see, not according to me, GMOs require more, not less inputs.  Inputs cost energy, and energy costs money, which is why millions are spent protecting nanny state subsidies for welfare queen ag firms that create this ""class of agricultural products"".

&gt;By this logic it's even easier to condemn things like organic agriculture, which are lower yielding resulting in more environmental destruction for the same amount of food as conventional agriculture.

Even Ireland was exporting food during the potato famine.  Food security has never been a matter of yield, but I believe this is a reasonable misconception to have, because the idea that people can starve despite there being enough food is so counter-intuitive.  There is plenty of research tying food insecurity to political phenomena, markets and centralization but I don't know of any literature focusing on yield when it comes to food security.

I don't know what you mean by ""organic"", but before the emergence of our current highly technological food system , farms *produced* energy.  Today they *consume* energy.  Yes, GMO farms are less efficient than stupid small holder farms 200 years ago.  So I ask you: yield per unit *what*?  We know it's not energy.  90% of the land goes to fuel and cows.

I am not condemning genetic modification, I'm just pointing out that it is unnecessary, and has thus far been worthy of condemnation in practice.  I have not seen a convincing argument justifying their continued use or development.

This sort of thing obsessed me at your age.  I had so many people I did not want to end up like.  It turns our paying rent is one of the easier things to do..  You get paid, and you pay the landlord.  Not living with your parents is overrated.  You don't magically get more responsible for leaving home.  In fact, I have found the opposite can be true.  Also, I know many people who live at home and build wealth to buy a house.

In my case, I realized the obsession with ""not wanting to end up like"" was rooted in an intense instinct to judge.  That same instinct petrified my young mind, and made it hard to make any decisions.  I was more animated by fear than curiosity, or my interests, or my need to serve my neighbor.  I especially judged people's career paths as ""short sighted"" or whatever (film production, construction, dropping out and waiting tables).  It turned out that my friends who waited tables for a decade after college ended up entering different fields (nursing and production) and they have amazing fulfilling lives filled with family, creative endeavors and even totally unproductive loafing time playing games and watching sports!

Another thing that petrified me was fear I was somehow missing out on all the experiences I should have been having at my age.  That was a big one.  If I did not have a blast on the weekend I literally could not focus the next week on my studies.  The idea that you'll never be (insert age) again so you better live it up spoiled all the fun by making it a duty.   I had much more fun after college than before.

When you are searching your memory for a name, how do you know you've recalled the correct one?  Like suppose I am trying to remember a girls name who's name is Sandy.  First I remember ""it had like an S.  Right?""  If I get a certain feeling, I know that is right.  ""Sheri?""  The feeling is not right.  ""Sally"".  Still not the right feeling.  ""Sara""  Ok, that definitely does not trigger the feeling.

""Sandy""  At this moment, whats going on is I am seeing if the feeling is there.

&gt;A religion which came after Christianity, which took some truths and denied other truths, and sought and seeks to convert Christians is certainly not of God though, right?

It could be that Muhammad was misled about Christianity by (gasp) Christians.  One theory is that the Arians were partially responsible for this misrepresentation.  But this tells us little about what our posture should or should not be toward people brought up in this faith, to whom Islam *is* first.  If we put ourselves in their shoes, we see that there should be no amount of spoken proselytizing that will change their faith.

Seems a bit naive to say the pill was her idea, as if it would not have arisen without her.  Ditto for Pincus.

It may surprise some readers here that Margaret Sanger's advocacy for the pill was to provide an alternative to abortion.  In light of the possibility that the pill *increased* the amount of abortions through some cultural mechanism, or induced demand, Catholics can nonetheless learn a lesson from Sanger's radical anti-abortion zeal:

You are not always having the effect you think you are having.

As the Pope recently pointed out, all forms of birth control are part of a program to limit population in service to justification to the continuance of a lifestyle that can never be universalized.  It seems to me that rather than pursuing a failed strategy of addressing abortion through medical or political innovation, we are called to address it at its root in economic justice, and culture.

Great interview where we find out that her Catholic mother was maliciously impregnated by her Atheist father.  Although, in contrast to claims in the PBS article, Sanger doesn't attribute her advocacy for the pill to this event.  But notice her trepidation to even say the word abortion.  Taken with her article above, 
it seems evident that Sanger was crucially animated by a desire to curb abortion.

I read it's closer to a third (yes I know that's more :), and anyway, that demand would easily be gobbled up by the majority of non-pp facilities especially considering they all have extra-capacity owing to the plummeting abortion rate.

Not that we have any substantiation for the claim that BCP use in the US precipitated the first abortion rate spike in the first place, but GG Pincus invented it...sort of.

First, if someone initiates engagement with the chart before knowing if their action has the effect for or against the cause in question that they think it has, it could lead to a false certainty that would not be there in the chart's absence.  Second, it is more and more understood that a feature of the modern world is that the remote channel has become the main conduit through which evil occurs.

Obedience is one of the main problems facing mankind.  It is how the national socialists and the SS perpetrated what they did in the 30s and 40s.  And there were always multiple layers of administrative diffusion of responsibility.  Just look at Adolf Eichman's trial.  He simply cannot grasp that just by trying to advance his career and do his Job right that he had caused such havoc.  Repeatedly he says it was his superiors duty to investigate the legality of the order.  This realization prompted Stanley Milgram to do his experiments on Obedience.  He found that an actor in a white lab coat with a clip board could get 60% of Americans to shock a man to death just by asking them to.

Careerism is another danger.  Albert Speer wrote a great book about his motivations where he attributes his inaction to a singular focus on getting the job done well.

&gt;The most important of all are workingmen's unions, for these virtually include all the rest. History attests what excellent results were brought about by the artificers' guilds of olden times. They were the means of affording not only many advantages to the workmen, but in no small degree of promoting the advancement of art, as numerous monuments remain to bear witness. Such unions should be suited to the requirements of this our age - an age of wider education, of different habits, and of far more numerous requirements in daily life. It is gratifying to know that there are actually in existence not a few associations of this nature, consisting either of workmen alone, or of workmen and employers together, but it were greatly to be desired that they should become more numerous and more efficient. We have spoken of them more than once, yet it will be well to explain here how notably they are needed, to show that they exist of their own right, and what should be their organization and their mode of action.

But I have to agree with my man Mike_the_Moose, here.  Worker *ownership* is where it's at.  Labor unions are what happen when ownership is denied workers, or when workers deny ownership.

An tapestry of Worker cooperatives, worker-owned enterprises and democratic structures needs to be built from within the current system.

Now I will say, viewing such an undertaking as a phased plan, that there is likely a place for an increased partnership with labor in getting to the next stage.  There is almost certainly a place for state assistance for the less well off, or so Rerum Novarum maintains.

&gt;The richer class have many ways of shielding themselves, and stand less in need of help from the State; whereas the mass of the poor have no resources of their own to fall back upon, and must chiefly depend upon the assistance of the State. And it is for this reason that wage-earners, since they mostly belong in the mass of the needy, should be specially cared for and protected by the government.

1648,"Atheism is a declaration made by a person.  Similar to the declaration that a person believes in the positive case, the declaration is substantiated only by their testimony.  So, for starters, assuming a completely secular posture, we just have no evidence atheism is possible.

Second, following from the idea that a set of psychological phenomena comprising what we term religious belief arises from our biology, we have this situation whereby it may be biologically impossible to not experience religious belief.

Assuming a secular posture, I would say the psychological phenomena comprising religious belief cannot be willed away by simple declaration any more than any other features of our biology.  They can only be mastered.  Mastery would mean channeling these drives toward a non-destructive end.  Perhaps this is the distinction in mind when it was written that faith without works is dead.  Faith without works is unconscious.

So, in other words, the closest we can get to atheism is Catholicism.

I think the softness with which I have been speaking has confused you.

In fact, such a guarantee is *mandated*.  The guarantee comes from God.  It is not needed, it is granted.  The mitigation of that divine guarantee is, of course, the gravest sin I can think of, which exacerbates other injustices, including abortion (again, that's the USCCB and the Pope's contention, not mine.)  Not only *can* this guarantee be honored within the confines of subsidiarity and distributism, this is how it *must* be carried out.

As Saint Ambrose has said in synthesizing Gospel teaching, and as Rerum novarum reiterates:
""You are not making a gift of your possessions to the poor person. You are handing over to him what is his. For what has been given in common for the use of all, you have arrogated to yourself. The world is given to all, and not only to the rich.""

Somehow they have chipped away at the demand such that their rates are lower than countries where abortion is outlawed.

Nor did I say, imply or believe that these features need to be offered on a universal, centralized basis.  Universality of education, food access, healthcare, security and income insurance would not be objectionable to church teaching as long as such universality were administered in accordance with subsidiarity.  For example, if you and I want to enter into an arrangement where we will cover one another if the other one gets injured, or falls on hard times, that is simply an insurance policy.  The church is not against voluntary insurance.  It is against totalizing, centralized state socialism in the context of concentrated wealth.

&gt;Unlike the scientific socialists, distributists to not believe in empowering the state to manage potentially all economic activity for the good of the society. Distributism proposes a society structured on the principles of subsidiarity, where the lower foundational levels of society have natural rights which the higher levels cannot usurp. Even when assisting those lower levels, the higher levels cannot usurp the roles and functions which rightfully belong to the lower levels.

This is why subsidiarity is essential.  But reaching a point where a just society based on subsidiarity and distributism is possible will require a radical transformation, I think you will agree.

I am utterly unimpressed and unmoved by the planned parenthood sex ed materials.  At 13, there was nothing the outside world could show me about sex that I had not already thought of, and ten times more extreme.  Kids talk to each other.  Word gets around fast.  We ran circles around anything pp offers now.  We drew extreme sex comics depicting group sex, anal sex, sex with aliens... You name it, we depicted it.  And this was *before* the internet.  You should have heard the discussion my friends and I had about what we would like to do to the girl in our class.  It was all talk, of course, and we are all happily married with kids, now.  We all went to catholic school, btw.  The public school kids had *nothing* on us.  I was a ring leader of these activity, often initiating the comics which were sometimes 40 pages long.  The momentum of the sexual energy behind these activities was heightened by their taboo.  Nothing was more of a downer, then, than when the adults would demystify it all, and deflate the issue with sex ed.

I think you are missing the real effect of these sex ed materials.  I share your disgust with them, but probably for very different reasons.  To me, their effect is to sexually traumatize youths by co-opting the taboo behaviors, and diffusing the explosive potential they have when relegated to the marginal regions of discourse.  When the establishment is telling you ""yeah, anal sex is okay, it's normal to masturbate, here's how to do it"" etc etc, it only serves to take all the ""fun"" out of it.  You have to admit, there is no way this is going to encourage any youth to do anything.  It will most likely discourage them.  And I don't think that is too far off from what is it actually designed to do.  They are basically starting from a realistic view of where teens already are, and trying to run up along side them to deliver messages from the State.  But it makes no sense that they would be advocating population control, since the state depends on revenue from a runaway market economy that depends on an ever-expanding supply of new consumers and working-age population.

I don't think discouraging youths from having sex is what we should be doing.  I don't believe it is advisable as an approach even if that is the goal.  Not in pp's manner, or any other manner.  The way to correct our youth is to involve them in real movements to transform society, and to strike at the root sicknesses afflicting it.  Instead we are wasting our energy wringing out hands over the symptoms (like this damned video does).

Pursuing prohibition only succeeds in dividing the Catholic vote on issues which *actually* affect someone's choice to have an abortion (*id est* anti-poverty legislation)

*Highly restrictive abortion laws are not associated with lower abortion rates. For example, the abortion rate is 29 per 1,000 women of childbearing age in Africa and 32 per 1,000 in Latin America—regions in which abortion is illegal under most circumstances in the majority of countries. The rate is 12 per 1,000 in Western Europe, where abortion is generally permitted on broad grounds.

Just war, capital punishment and other vestiges of the early church's marriage with pagan power structures, and complications that caused in the ensuing millennia are slowly being cleansed away.  The church no longer uses a large wooden mallet to squash people's heads.  The church no longer accepts abortion at earlier states, as the Aristotelian Decretum Gratiani allowed.

Revelation, science and a commitment to the gospels will allow Catholics to purge pagan pollution from their church for good in due time.  I think this is something Weigel and people like myself should agree on.

We never learn.

Two iron rules the Right has always grasped and the left never does.  
First, spectrum control.  There needs to be a publically visible party or initiative that is perceived as far more ""extreme"" than the candidate.  The candidate then can denounce this extreme along with the opponent on the other side, and appear moderate.  In Bernie case, he actually is the moderate, from a global political spectrum perspective.
Second, only a crisis affords the possibility of radical change. Milton Friedman said it best, Naomi Klein explicated it, we all know it's true, and yet we keep on supporting people like the Clintons.  In a crisis, the new order is assembled out of ideas that are laying around.  Our primary task should be to develop those ideas.  I know they already exist in elemental form, but we need to be constantly adapting the plan for their application along the lines of current realities, which are ever changing.

We may need a pledge, or an education campaign or something by Bernie voters that we will not vote for a corporate funded candidate as a second option.

1837,"&gt;Basic Income. It's the way of the future people. Less work. More learning. More BEING!

It seems to me that GBI is just reversing the efficiency you create when you automate someone's job.  I only mention this to illustrate that the if the rationality behind automating jobs doesn't proceed from humanitarianism, but from personal enrichment and security, then there's no reason to think the same will not be the case when it comes to instituting GBI.

Firms don't create efficiencies so they can share the gains with humanity.  If workers could not force firms to let them keep their jobs, why do we think firms will pay them for doing nothing?

Or, if we irrationally assume Gort will enforce GBI funding, then once we realize automation=GBI, we start to realize the pointlessness of firing people in the first place, and thus the pointlessness of automation.  Suddenly automators are out of a job.

Speaking of Gort, it occurs to me that once AI enters the public policy realm, and starts to tackle the problem of efficient resource allocation, and the security and enforcement it will require, all other forms of automation will plummet in number.  An artificial intelligence planner could plan an economy where all people serve a purpose and are happy.

1840,"&gt;But even if it wasn't buying in bulk, or doing anything more efficiently, it's got 1/25 as many MRI machines.

Far be it from me to argue on behalf of sprawlsville, but let me try anyway.

Efficiency of one thing is often inefficiency of another.
True Denseopolis has 1/25 as many MRI machines, but also 1/25 as many MRI-related jobs.  The consumer splits the gains of this efficiency with the ownership.  It is an efficiency gain on the supply side to the detriment of an efficiency on the demand side (before you quote me on that, hear me out).  And it isn't just MRI-related jobs or even  healthcare that are like this.  Everything in Denseopolis favors supply efficiency to the exclusion of demand efficiency.  It could be that everything in Denseopolis is more efficient, except for the way its economy allocates resources to inhabitants.

Denseopolis might spend most of the winnings of its efficiency gains on GBI for a population which has become increasingly superfluous.  Add to this the fact that it is hard for manufacturers to compete when there are less opportunities for the consumer, as it were, to choose, and you see another inefficiency.  Contrast with sprawlsville where MRI techs are reviewing and recommending systems to eachother constantly.  How often do they get to evaluate a new one in Denseopolis?  Here, Denseopolis favors large firm competition, where MRI techs in Denseopolis can talk to other MRI techs in another, distant Denseopolis.  But even worse,  a handful of global firms wins the few contracts to be won in each Denseopolis, leading to an overall effect of ownership allocation inefficiency.  In effect, the amount of firm ownership per person goes down.

I can think of lots of these.  I don't know.  I am not a fan of Sprawlsville, having grown up in a community where every family lives on a half acre.  That said, Denseopolis has some real problems as well.  Some seem merely cultural, at first, but end up having economic consequences (eg. anonymity, accountability, serial defection, free-ridership and collective action problems).  How can a community effectively govern something as massive as the institutions found in Denseopolis, to say nothing of the management of Denseopolis itself.",2015-07-07 23:35:57+00:00,csvlaqs,18.0,t1_csuhp2f,79464.0,dataisbeautiful

The reason the US can't have the healthcare they have in comparable countries has more to do with our extreme income inequality.  That is why Obamacare is perfect for the US.  It is not an entitlement for the poor.  It is an entitlement for private healthcare firms.

I just have to laugh at the various explanations I hear for why the US is incomparable to European countries with better health outcomes who pay half as much for it.  My favorite is scale.  Lost on people using this argument is the fact that in insurance, larger size is better.  The other old standby is the argument that in the US, we are too diverse.  For this reason to be valid we would have to believe that *every* country with universal healthcare is biologically and culturally consistent, and that a country like the US could not regionally administer a nationally funded program.",2015-07-04 20:11:32+00:00,css89up,8.0,t1_css5ebc,6092.0,dataisbeautiful
1849,"I've heard of old pianos that are 10 whole inches taller than that (I know not all of that is necessarily translates to speaking length, but still).  It would seem my goal should be to find an old, tall upright with a large string angle and bridges pretty near the top and bottom of the cabinet.  

Is there a list of uprights pianos by dimension?  Isn't there some book that lists all pianos ever produced along with details?  I could search it for ""height: 60 inches"" ""height: 61 inches"" ""height:x cm"" etc etc.

Ok, I'm going to start whining, now.

I can't believe I'm the only person (besides a few experimenters) on the entire internet who ever wanted a professional upright with the lowest inharmonicity.

Personally, I think it is unacceptable that there are no uprights with strings that are as long as, say, a steinway d.  It's not like the harmonic differences are unnoticeable.  They are *quite* noticeable.

1853,"&gt; But uber wouldn't of came about if majority of taxis weren't such shit holes

Look at the the long game.  Uber simply leveraged newly existing technology and promoted it in an agile way that is impossible to cab organizations.  They are paying ""tuition"" now to disrupt their way into the market.  Next they'll fully monetize their presence, the insane deals they baited everyone with will go away, at which point they will have also been subject to the same stultifying regulations and influences making them just like any other cab.  But of course, ""any other cab"" will have long adopted the technology and approaches uber (a tech startup) understandably beat them to the punch on.

I see uber trying to shut down  light, independent competition in the future, but they will not be doing it for drivers.  They'll be doing it for investors.",2015-06-25 19:49:13+00:00,csilnon,4.0,t1_csi7q6c,21358.0,worldnews
1854,"It's true, an article essentially telling us shes an inadequate, business-as-usual candidate is pretty unnecessary.  No one who is going to win is going to not be concluding a pact with concentrated wealth interests.  Obama got more corporate money than McCain (people forget).  If Bernie wins, even he will have taken their money.

A vote for anyone who has a chance to win is a vote for the system.  I don't even buy the Supreme Court nomination argument.  The decisions of the supreme court mean surprisingly little when literally *every other important area of policy* is almost completely off.  I'm so done with dems getting by on the mere fact that the repugs are worse.  I say, shoot the hostage.  They want to slowly choke out the country?  Fuck that.  Put a bullet in its head and call it a day.  Afterall, the real problem is cultural.  There is a complacency that runs so deep.  You can't get people involved in anything to save their own lives.  Conversely, if informed people were fed up and ready to act, then it would not matter that the court is conservative.

If republicans had had complete control of all houses and the executive since 2008, regardless of supreme court, we would arguably be in a much better *cultural* position to institute radical change, regardless of (and possibly due in part to) having a horrendously conservative supreme court.  What I mean is people would be more likely to get involved if they didn't have the palliative that *is* the democrats.  It's not even an original point in the least.

I know so many comfy democrats who believe in ""baby steps"".  No.  That is not how this country is designed to work.  One party needs complete control long enough to fuck it up or turn it around so that it is obvious who to keep in power or throw out.  But it hasn't even been functioning on this very inadequate level thanks to purple candidates like the Clintons and Obama (and really, the whole style of political strategy they merely exemplify).  So we have a low-democratic-by-design system that is not even functioning as such.  A circuit that is designed to work badly is not even working as intended.

1862,"Are we counting famine deaths and deaths resulting from food insecurity-related illness?  These phenomena are easily linked to war, and while not ""violence"" are no less violent in any substantive way I can think of.

I think the perception of distinction arises out of the illusion of consciousness in the case of war-related decision making at the nation-state level.  But do we really believe that, for example, the sentence ""Russia decided to invade"" is anything but gibberish?

Perhaps there is just as much consciousness involved in ""violent"" death as there is in any other unjust death.",2015-06-22 17:55:28+00:00,csez7do,4.0,t1_csewm6b,4135.0,dataisbeautiful
