1)  **Don't study.  Know everything by having practiced in real life**.  This one is a non-starter since you will have had to have either broken the law by contracting without a license for years, or worked under someone who methodically showed you the business and legal ropes *on top of* running the company and doing the work themselves.  

2)  **You're over-thinking it.  Buy a membership to an online exam study ""school"".**  A specific recommendation never accompanies, not that one should trust just anyone's recommendation online.  Also, as an approach, it seems wrong.  This is the internet.  You can download things that are illegal to download.  So how is it that a set of questions and answers is on lock-down?

3)  **It's easy, you don't need to study.  Just use common sense.**  This commentator usually reasons that the test is meant for the lowest common denominator.

Hopefully we can break out of this pattern and help get some unlicensed people into the fold.  Anyone have any idea where to get study materials?  At the very least maybe we can move some of the above answers a bit furhter.  I remember googling for hours one night and nothing especially encouraging showed up.

I don't wonder why we aren't beating 2008 turnout.  It was the first black president, and nothing he proposed was specific enough to turn anyone off.  Moderates could see him as a moderate, and leftists could see him as a leftist.  But even that primary didn't crack 20% .

Hillary's coalition is composed of a demographic that happens to vote more reliably.  Old timers kick our ass at this, mostly because they have not changed residences 5 times in 5 years, have a steady income, get mailers from candidates at their *permanent address where they also live* and receive canvassing calls on their land line.  I can't tell you how many times I called a 19 or 20 year old, their parent picked up, said they weren't home, were sleeping or moved and hung up.  I think older voters are more likely to have cars which make it easier to vote, if for no other reason than you register to vote when you register you car!  What's more, you get your registration form in the mail, virtually ensuring you'll be able to vote when that call comes in on your land line.

Also, didn't some of the early States' primaries occur during mid term exams?  My God.  What about finals. Final papers.  We forget that our would-be voters are still deciding the outcome of their life, under extreme pressure while taking on debt and facing failure.  It feel like a life or death struggle from which you cannot for a second look away.

Older people also don't get quite as rattled by life as noobs.  After my first breakup, I could not be bothered to care about my core beliefs for a few months.  

NOW, as hard as it is to understand someone who did not vote, consider that even I, having contributed at least $600 and phone banking whenever I can, was not even registered democrat in my state, and I did not know it is a closed primary.  All of these individual fuck-ups born of not having one's shit together conspire to depress turnout among the populations most likely to vote Sanders.

But still, 12%????  WTAF?

So what is to be done?  First off, remember, this low turnout situation is benefiting the conservative in the democratic race.  So don't be disheartened by results.  Years of no real choices has embedded political free-ridership into the culture.  Voting is something only *engaged* people do, so we have to engage people.  Talk to the people you know in their language.  Tell them this is different.  Tell them their lives and their children's lives could actually be improved.  Second,  while the Clinton machine may not be engaging in voter purging, don't expect them to lift a finger to remedy the myriad factors exerting added downward pressure on turnout because her core constituencies are far less affected by those than ours.  That means WE have to do something.  And whining on the internet is not enough.  We need to increase turnout AND protect the vote -- but setting the record straight is also important, especially when you're up against the orwellian PAC named ""Correct the Record"".

Getting back to the main point:

Don't get discouraged by the results of this election.  We are up against a lot of entrenched apathy, corruption and lack of functionings for voting rights.  But remember, if factors causing low turnout disproportionately affect our coalition, then it's also true that higher turnout helps us.  If you know someone who is away at college, call them, get their address, and mail them a registration form and main-in ballot for their state.

*Clinton is the weaker general election candidate in this race*.  

Sanders is far safer.  His favorability is consistently far higher, she is vulnerable on a number of key areas, she is a fragile candidate, who's handlers are now saying Sanders' criticisms of her are ""wounding"" her by giving republicans ammo.  Sanders also does consistently better than Clinton in GOP match-ups.  Add to this Sanders' midterm turnout down-ticket bonus and the fact that he has future voters locked down, as well as his more robust funding mechanism and you start to see why a superdelegate concerned with victory would select Sanders.

Superdelegates were a makeshift to be instituted in democracy's stead.  We are in a unique situation where superdelegates can simultaneously do right by the majority of the electorate while performing their realpolitik function in beating the GOP.

They then compare turnout to the year the first black president was running on ""hope"" and ""change"" as if that tells us anything meaningful about this race.  The fact is that  **Democratic turnout is around 12%** and in 2008 it didn't even crack 20%.

So suppose Half (2 Million) wanted to vote for Sanders and could not.  How is that democratic?  Another user pointed out that the point of closed primaries is to enforce party loyalty and reduce bad-faith voting.  The problem with this is that we DO have notoriously weak parties that don't even pretend to stick to their platform.  In other words, democrats who adhere to the party platform, are the ones who left.  

Of course the result of the anti-democratic primary is that we are more likely to lose the general because a weaker candidate will prevail due to the intrinsically lower turnout.

I've been looking at getting a B license in California, so I have been reading websites and PDF's and calling people for a couple weeks, now.  My mind has been focused on the best way to go about becoming a qualified, well-rounded, confident construction tradesman so that when the cslb deputy reviews my application, she will approve it.

My first time reading through the dad-joke-named ""Blueprint for becoming a Licensed Contractor"" I didn't think anything of this, but something about going from jobsite to jobsite before they begin their work for the day and asking to get indentured, and planning for four years of experience and courses in my chosen trade followed by additional work as a journeyman in order to be able to sit for the license exam made my eyes halt upon reading that a law, business or accounting degree may be substituted for two years of experience.

That's right, a lawyer can flip a couple houses and BAM, they're  qualified to be a contractor.  Meanwhile,  a journeyman who has completed four years of apprenticeship, waking up a 5am and completing very specific construction trade courses isn't.  In fact, after becoming a journeyman, you could very likely find yourself working for a business major house flipper so that you can be as experienced in your trade as he is in the eyes of the CSLB.

They also overweigh owner-builder experience.  An owner-builder is assumed to have journeyman-level experience.  I actually called them to ask about this.  I asked how they weigh owner-builder experience claims versus those of a trained journeyman, for example.  Afterall, I, as an inexperienced putz, cannot expect to claim a years worth of experience for a job a qualified person could have finished in a week, right?  Wrong.  I can expect that.  As the deputy's assistant told me, ""we take your word for it.  We take it at face value"".

It doesn't help that the same day, a licensed plumber came to replace my toilet's flange and wax ring and came back with the wrong parts twice, sat in his car between each failure watching YouTube videos about how to install a repair flange, and tried to charge me $450.

I'm sure I'm not the first to say that I suspect the CSLB maybe has  a nice little racket going which neither ensures professionalism nor protects consumers.

How?  Priority at federal passport agencies is rationed by urgency.  So the closer your flight is, the faster they'll help you.

If you Google anything passport related, your first few hits will likely be expensive private firms who want you to believe they have some secret, inside track that is worth $400.  Even if you google ""federal passport agency"" the top hit is one of these firms (of course everyone's searches vary).

First you call and try to get an appointment that day using the [national passport center 24-hour hotline](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/where-to-apply/agencies/national-passport-center.html). It will list several agencies in your region.  If your nearest one is booked, try another location.

Now i know a vast majority of conservatives are going to loyally vote party line, but that is no excuse to leave them out there without engaging them.

I think as an approach the material could focus on showing how Bernie's policies would better serve conservative interests than republicans policies will.  I have been focusing on how government-dependent corporations have bought all the major candidates (without pointing out dem or repub).  I focus on the corruption of both parties and the entire government, not just republicans.

Maybe focus on classical republican values like ending wage slavery, and use quotes from prominent republicans.  But also delve deeper.  This may require patient dialogue in the comments (please resist the temptation to snark).  For example, when republicans hate on minimum wage hikes because these jobs are ""supposed to be temporary youth jobs"", this is actually hearkening back to the valuable republican idea that there ought to be enough room in the economy for everyone to own their own enterprise.  The problem is, due to sellout dems and repuglicans, policy favors large, government-dependent firms.  Large firms dominate the scene, and in business school they teach you how to lock out the competition using any means possible, including the law and government.  Here, the material can tap into the anger around regulations that hurt small business.

I am not content to just sit here in Bernie land while my journeying friends and family are led astray.

edit:  Some good ideas in the comments.  I just remembered abortion.  This is a tougher one, because people who happen to believe a fetus is human will never be swayed by the choice narrative.  I instead focus on the strong correlation between poverty and abortion.  When I have posted this in response to abortion related material on social media, I have been confronted with ""no man, it's about convenience.""  At this point, I focus more intently on the poverty connection since even the poor need to scrape together money for abortions.

It is one of those lazy arguments that passes without scrutiny and everyone just accepts it.  Even Bernie has capitulated to it, couching the much-needed statements concerning successful approaches from places like Denmark with brief disclaimers like ""although these countries are small and homogeneous...""

It happened tonight.  Bernie said we can learn from the Nordic countries when it comes to social safety nets like healthcare as a right and AC trotted out the same old meme in response.  ""But Denmark has a population of 5.6 million."" The implication being that whatever solutions they have in Nordic countries will not scale to larger populations, like in the U.S.

* Social insurance is like any other insurance.  Insurance is the pooling of resources to cover contingencies in a smaller subset such that the resource pool is stable.  When it comes to insurance pools, bigger is better.

* If you believe in the concept of insurance, you are a socialist.  There is no escaping this.  Once you are in favor of insurance, you have to be in favor of the main concept of insurance, (larger pools).

* Larger populations can be broken into smaller more manageable sets, by city, state or region for the purposes of administering universal coverage.  Consider the total population of all the Nordic Countries and other countries with developed social insurance schemes.  Now consider a state-by-state Nordic-style program in the U.S., perhaps further supplemented by federal funds where necessary.

* And what about homogeneity?  The idea is that the more diverse your population is, the less like Nordic countries you are, and consequently the more dubious it becomes that Nordic models can apply in the US.  Again, specious.  First, yes, we are far more ""economically diverse"" (*ie* unequal) than these countries, but does anyone think we are really more diverse than all of these other countries *combined*?  And besides, what's the private answer to diversity?  There isn't one.  We just keep paying double for worse health outcomes while [hundreds of thousands die of amenable conditions](http://m.content.healthaffairs.org/content/27/1/58.abstract)

You start to see the weakness of the rebuttal-by-scale talking point when you think it through for even a few seconds.

Another area of missed opportunity is on corporate welfare.  Every time anyone brings up socialism, Bernie needs to use the opportunity to say we already have it.  The bailouts were not the only time corporations fed at the public trough.  In fact, the higher up you go in the  Fortune 500, the more desperate welfare queens you find.  It is called ""industrial policy"" and ""fiscal policy"" and it comes in the form of fossil fuel subsidies to the tune of a trillion annually.  Bernie has got to do a better job of calling out these nanny state beneficiaries.  Something like ""We already have *un*democratic socialism for the few, mega corporations on the Fortune 500.  More public money goes straight to private hands in the U.S. Than in all Socialist countries combined.  I'm asking for a democratic approach to allocating public resources efficiently and for the benefit of all rather than a few well-connected firms with powerful lobbies.  With more money in the pockets of lower income folks, our consumption based economy can once again grow and grow justly.""",SandersForPresident,Why Nordic Approaches Will Work Even Better in the U.S.,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3op6oq/why_nordic_approaches_will_work_even_better_in/

The problem is that it seems to be less in-tune after the tuning.  Now, I realize this is fraught with danger for non-piano tuners like me to talk about, and that talking about a piano being ""in-tune"" is not the same as saying a choir is, but I'll be damned if the second A from the bottom (A2?) is not a little *too* flat.  E2 + A3 sound normal, but A2+E2 don't.

Are there different accepted tuning approaches that lead to different outcomes?  Especially in the first 20 or so notes?  Many of the fifths sound less pure than ones that are right next to them.  Even some of the octaves sound less pure.

I noticed this while the tuner was still here, and he saw me linger on the particularly disappointing fifth A2+E2 and he told me it was because my strings were old.  To be fair, the strings are probably over 100 years old, but did they suddenly age during the tuning?

Also, I think I may have thrown him off because I requested that he keep the piano tuned to 435hz, which is where it was when I bought it, and where I believe it has always been.  He attested to the integrity of the piano mechanically and otherwise (besides the string age).  In the end he told me it was ""close"" to 435hz.

Now the bad news.

Pop music is comprised of a narrow set of contemporary conventions optimized for commerce.  What's more it evokes in the listener feelings from where they usually experience pop music in their daily life.  It is mundane.  It is not sacred.  Worse:  it's distracting.

Music making use of conventions from commercial song has no place in a church.  Much less a church which already has its own music, of which all western music is highly derivative.

Assuming we cannot all agree on what music is appropriate, it seems there are then two possible courses of action we must choose from:

1) Speak all parts of the mass for which singing is not required

Or

2) sing as much as is allowed, but all singing is in plainchant.

How might one go about putting either of these possibilities into practice in ones own parish?  Well, usually there are a group of musicians or a single musician who, being someone who pursued a musical career in the commercial realm, is now applying their expertise in service of their congregation, usually for modest compensation.  Although there can be volunteers as well.

How to manage this delicate situation?

There are three types of parishioners.  The first doesn't seem to care what the musical setting is.  The second likes the commercial cadences and other familiar properties of the music which they experience as being completely normal and appropriate.  The third cannot stand the commercial tripe spewing forth from the egotistical failed musician who inflicts the syrupy, cheesy fluff mass after mass, slowly eating away at the souls of all in attendance while welcoming the specter of commercialism into the one place where it should never be.

Now that latter group may not be in the majority, but besides the musician itself, they are the most vested and the most activated.  Clearly, these parishioners don't *have* to tolerate this outrage.  But what route should they take toward making the changes that need to be made?  How to disentrench the agents of commercial music from ones church?
