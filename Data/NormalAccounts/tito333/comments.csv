475,"If America as a whole is a non-discriminatory, welcoming place, then how does that explain the rise of Donald Trump? 

I think your clarification is good, and I largely agree: Haitians go to the DR for almost the same reason as Dominicans go to the US, but it's not unreasonable to admit that the circumstances are wildly different. 

I'm a Dominican that looks Moroccan and I used to get that nightclub treatment in Spain, people would also not believe me when I told them I was Dominican, since Moroccans lie about such things. Does that mean that Spain is as bad for Moroccan-looking people as the DR is for Haitians?

1) There's a large contingent of Americans who believe in the Confederacy and deny even the right of black people to be free, not just citizenship. This Confederacy existed multiple generations ago but the white descendants still cling to those beliefs. 

2) Peña Gomez. Even Trujillo had a Haitian grandmother, so we've had presidents with Haitian ancestry. How many US presidents have had Native American ancestry, or Japanese ancestry?

3) I lived in the inner city in the US, where my black peers referred to me and to each other as n*ggers on a daily basis. Since Dominicans are also black, we have just as much right to call each other negros and such.

4) There is full-blown segregation in the US for the most part, there's no large removal of people from neighborhoods because people live largely apart.

5) it was not a law, it was a tribunal clarification which applied to anyone born on Dominican soil, be they Arab, Chinese, or Black. If your grandparents and parents are from a country whose constitution defines you as a citizen regardless of place of birth, as is the case with the Haitian and Japanese constitutions, then you are a dual citizen even if you have Dominican citizenship. The Dominican state reserves the right to remove citizenship from a dual national, especially one from a nation formerly at war with it.

Buddy, if you think America's police forces in all-white police departments are black-friendly or that they're not in the 1950s, I just have to disagree with you. As a brown guy, I'm not willing to do a road trip in the US. I've been pulled over in situations where I was the passenger and was asked for ID and I know that we were being pulled over because my gf was white and ferrying around a black guy. I don't feel safe, and I would never want to be in a situation where an American cop pulls me over again with a white woman in the car, so I'm not even willing, as a US citizen, to drive around my own country.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-HK9CwQTBQ Remember, Haiti is a member of Caricom, so this is a block for which the DR was denied membership. 

To say that Haitians are ""encouraged"" to come makes it seem like Dominicans wanted large-scale Haitian immigration, which was never the case. 

It is a complex issue and it should have nothing to do with the fact that they're Haitians. Simply put, they're not cognitive immigrants and they're not wealthy immigrants. We have the right to get rid of every single dual national that does not attain a certain level of education and cannot meet certain financial requirements. Developed European nations have exactly these laws, and that's what I had to face when moving to Holland, so I want the same in the DR. All I want in the DR is Dutch law: legal weed, euthanasia, gay marriage, trans rights, and an immigration system which welcomes immigrants based on their calculated future ability to enrich the nation and integrate fully into the country's culture.",2016-10-02 10:57:28+00:00,d8an9k5,,t1_d8aci2h,28720.0,Dominican
476,"There was mass internment of Japanese citizens during WWII, they had committed no crimes, and white Americans have in the past burned many black neighborhoods (Black Wall Street) and committed lynchings of innocents. Those people spoke the same language as them and had the same passport. Being dark in the DR does not get you labeled a Haitian unless you clearly can't speak Spanish with a Dominican accent, a black Dominican does not have it as bad in the DR as a black American in the US. I simply can't believe that. 

I get that being denied a passport can be a big blow, but there's no other country that treats Haitians as well as the DR. In other countries they get put in cages, denied entry in all forms, and denied health care. The DR has no obligation to the Haitian people... no debt.

4199,"The Taliban in Afghanistan declared the start of their fighting season on Tuesday, vowing to take control of more territory and launch large-scale attacks against the Kabul government and its foreign allies, including the U.S.

Taliban’s announcement of their spring offensive occurs just days after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited the capital Kabul to reaffirm U.S. support for the government led by President Ashraf Ghani.

The proclamation has become an annual rite for the Islamist movement and usually heralds an increase in violence. The declaration coincides with the onset of spring, when snow melts and mountain passes open, enabling the group’s fighters to move more freely in many parts of the country.

It will be the first offensive since last summer’s disclosure that Taliban founder and spiritual leader Mullah Mohammad Omar had died two years earlier. In its statement Tuesday, the Islamist movement said it had named the current fighting season “Operation Omari” in their late leader’s honor.

“With the advent of spring it is again time for us to renew our jihadist determination and operations,” it added, saying fresh military operations would “employ all means at our disposal to bog the enemy down in a war of attrition.”

A spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman said the Taliban offensive would fail and Afghan forces were launching a counteroffensive, dubbed “Operation Shafaq.”

“They won't succeed, and we will bring peace to our people,” said the spokesman, Mohammad Radmanish.

The start of the fighting season follows a year of faltering efforts to restart direct peace talks between the Taliban and Mr. Ghani’s national-unity government. A four-country group made up of Afghanistan, the U.S., China and Pakistan have held meetings since January in an attempt to restart negotiations.

In its statement Tuesday, the Taliban hinted at its possible participation in talks, saying that along with the spring offensive it would seek to “open a dialogue with our countrymen in the enemy ranks” to establish a cohesive Islamic government.

Fighting between the Afghan government and the Taliban is now in its 15th year, and the violence shows no sign of abating. The United Nations said 11,000 civilians were wounded or killed in 2015, a record high. An estimated 5,500 Afghan government troops and police also were killed last year.

A U.S.-led invasion forced the Taliban from power in 2001 and 13 years later, U.S. and forces under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization formally concluded their combat mission, shifting to a training and advisory role but continuing counterterrorism operations. Some 13,000 U.S. and NATO forces remain in Afghanistan, and the U.S. is scheduled to draw down its forces from 9,800 to 5,500 by the end of the year.

The plan is under review, however, as Afghanistan’s security forces continue to perform erratically. In the past year, the Taliban has expanded its control of territory in rural Afghanistan and last fall, they temporarily seized the northern city of Kunduz, their biggest victory of the war.

The movement controls, or has heavy influence in, roughly a third of the country, U.S. and allied officials say. They control no cities.

Mullah Omar’s longtime deputy Mullah Akhtar Mansour formally took over the group’s leadership after news of the founder’s death emerged in July, sparking a prolonged period of infighting among the Taliban’s leaders.

A rebel Taliban group, led by Mullah Mohammad Rasool, has clashed with Mansour loyalists in several Afghan provinces. But the Taliban’s communication branch has sought to play down the internal rivalry by repeatedly insisting the group was unified.

The Taliban also face a challenge from the local branch of Islamic State, a rival for territory. The two jihadist groups have clashed repeatedly in parts of eastern Afghanistan, where Islamic State has established a small but significant presence.

They founded a city in the Dominican, Sosua, that today still has a synagogue, and the government gave any incoming Jews a monopoly on certain businesses. http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dominican-republic-helped-jews-fleeing-nazis-1454694715

And yes, remember that the US attacked its own ship, the USS Maine, to declare war on Spain, in order to steal Cuba and Puerto Rico, and Puerto Rico is basically next to the Dominican. That's why the US still has Guantanamo prison in Cuba today, and Puerto Rico is a commonwealth... everyone born there is a US citizen. http://www.falseflag.info/uss-maine/

I don't want to risk identifying myself, since I know the government just gave Reddit a National Security Letter, but my own great-grandfather fled Puerto Rico because the US was killing Spanish loyalists and raising taxes on farmers.

Believe it or not, the longest US military occupation in history has not been Afghanistan yet, but rather that of Haiti, from 1915-1934. The Dominican Rep. was also occupied by the US military from 1916-1924. 

The US had control of Dominican customs up until the 1940s, and then the US army invaded again in 1965. In 2003, the US backed a coup in Haiti, and then funded a campaign to kill supporters of the exiled President, Bertrand Aristide. Since the US-backed coup, Haiti has been under UN peacekeeper occupation. 

The United States has had a direct hand in all of the misery in Haiti, even backing the brutal dictator Papa Doc Duvalier, who created a voodoo army, the Tonton Macoutes, who would kill people and put the bodies on display until they rotted, killing any family member who tried to bury it.

Btw, did you know that Prescott Bush, George W. Bush's grandfather, was indicted for trading with the enemy, for bankrolling Nazi Germany? The connection to Wall Street is not that hard to make. The Bush family has had its hands in this since the 30s. 

The Bushes have since the 1920s been destabilizing basically the whole world. You have General Smedley Butler basically confessing that the Bushes were hiring him to overthrow the President and install a military dictatorship. A dictatorship that was pro-Zionist.

The collaborators kept it, but I think it shouldn't have been the case, the country would be more equitable today, instead you have a white, rich elite dating back to the dictatorship. 

I think you don't hear about this because Bosch had too many connections with important men: Bush Sr, and Antonio Veciana.

""The gram-negative efflux genes are widely distributed and normally associated with large plasmids, most of which are conjugative. They come from a number of different plasmid incompatibility groups (115, 176). These plasmids often carry other antibiotic resistance genes, heavy metal resistance genes, and/or pathogenic factors such as toxins (70). Thus, selection for any of these factors selects for the plasmid. This phenomenon of cross-selection has contributed to the dramatic increase in the number of multiple-drug-resistant bacteria over the last 40 years (146, 226).""

8496,"Residents of the Gaza Strip, including businesspeople and traders with ties to the Palestinian Authority, have complained that the Shin Bet security service has been grilling them to obtain more information about the situation in the Hamas-run enclave. The extensive questioning comes as they leave Gaza via the Erez crossing, even though they had already received exit permits after lengthy security checks.

Sometimes, the Gazans say, they are required to wait hours to be questioned, making them late for business meetings they have set up in the West Bank or Israel. Other times, they wait several hours but the questioning isn’t carried out and they’re instructed to return to Gaza and come back another day. From testimonies and complaints compiled by the Israeli Gisha organization (which works to ensure the freedom of movement for Palestinians), it appears the phenomenon has become much more widespread in recent months.

It was previously reported that patients on their way for medical treatment in the West Bank or Israel have been required to undergo Shin Bet questioning at the Erez crossing (as a condition for their being allowed to enter). And fishermen arrested on their boats under the pretext that they have crossed beyond their permitted fishing zone also told Haaretz they were immediately taken in for questioning by the Shin Bet, which sought to obtain information about their neighbors and relatives, and what was happening in Gaza. Reports from the Strip indicate that this practice is continuing, and that fishermen who are detained and released are later questioned by Hamas in Gaza.

What is new, however, is that the complaints are now coming from traders and other businesspeople who, in an Israeli effort to expand economic activity in Gaza, have been granted permission to cross into Israel on a regular basis with permits that are renewed every few months. Those delayed at the border are afraid to talk openly about having been questioned or what they have been asked – out of concern they will later be questioned by Hamas security forces.

The widespread assumption among residents in Gaza is that compulsory questioning at the border is one of the Shin Bet’s means of trying to recruit people who will collaborate with the Israeli security service on a regular basis. Gazans with whom Haaretz has spoken have said the questioning and delays at the border are creating and reinforcing an atmosphere of suspicion against various segments of the Gazan population – particularly those with ties to the PA.

One prominent Palestinian businessman, identified here as F.S., has close ties to the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority. “[The Shin Bet] started harassing us for some time, even though we have identity documents as businesspeople and our connections [with Israelis and Israel’s District Coordination Office for Gaza (DCO)] are good,” he told Haaretz. “The entire process is very humiliating. They cause us to wait at Erez, sometimes for many hours. That’s what happened to me a few weeks ago. I went over [to the Israeli side] of the Erez border crossing at around 10 A.M. and was told to wait for a meeting until 4:30 P.M. People who identified themselves as Shin Bet [operatives] interrogated me and then let me go, and I continued on my way.

“Another time,” F.S. continued, “I arrived at the Erez crossing. They demanded that I wait, and then that I go back to the Strip and come back for a meeting [with the Shin Bet] another day. It happened to a lot of my colleagues [from the private sector], and all of us were late for meetings we had scheduled. And we’re wondering why. After all, Israel is touting the fact that it’s giving businesspeople and traders permits to improve the economy [of Gaza] and prevent disaster. But one hand gives and the other gets in the way.” The long waits, the practice of sending people back to Gaza without explanation and the interrogation itself are all very humiliating, he said.

M.A., 31, submitted a request to the Israeli authorities last October for an exit permit, prior to a visa-application interview at the American consulate. During the second week of November, he was told the permit request had been approved and he should come to the Erez checkpoint immediately. He was detained there for questioning by Shin Bet officials, who instructed him to return to Gaza and submit a new permit request. Which he duly did.

On December 7, a representative of the Palestinian Civil Affairs Committee – which transfers such requests to the Israeli authorities – informed him that he could cross the border the next day. So, he reached the checkpoint on December 8, waited several hours without being questioned by security officials, and was once more told to return to Gaza. He filed a third request and was allowed to leave the Strip on January 20.

In a letter to Col. Gen. Fares Attila (the commander of Israel’s DCO in Gaza), the head of Gisha’s legal department, Naomi Hager, complained about the delays and questioning Gazans who have already been cleared for an exit permit have been experiencing, a practice she called illegal.

She wrote that only the Office of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT, which includes the DCO in Gaza) had the authority to grant permits, following a background check, and that no other party has the right to reopen the process. However, an employee at the DCO in Gaza replied that the law did allow other security entities to interrogate and detain people at the crossing.

Asked for a response by Haaretz, the Shin Bet spokesperson’s office said, “During the security evaluation process of Palestinians seeking to enter Israel, a series of steps are carried out by security officials, including, as appropriate, the questioning of some applicants. Security officials are careful to deal with the applicants respectfully, despite the inconvenience (which is not unusual at crossing points between regions and countries).” Gisha, meanwhile, again highlights that those questioned have already passed a background check and received permits to cross into Israel.

Last year, Palestinians made a total of 171,309 crossings into Israel at Erez, according to Gisha’s figures. (This is not the number of people who crossed into Israel, since most crossers did so several times). About 55 percent of the recorded crossings were by traders and other businesspeople, while 18 percent were by patients and those accompanying them. The figures reflect a 127 percent increase over 2014, when there were 75,238 crossings at Erez.

This increase shows COGAT has responded to international calls to soften the stringent criteria that have officially been in place since 2007, and which formally provide for permits only in exceptional humanitarian circumstances. The number of those allowed to leave to study outside of the Strip or for work-related meetings abroad via the Erez crossing has increased (even though they are not considered “exceptional humanitarian cases”). In spite of the increase, Gisha stressed that the exit permits represent only a tiny fraction of the 1.8 million Gaza population. For example, in September 2000, 500,000 crossings of workers into Israel were registered.

It sounds like your father was the victim of corruption and tyranny, which having lived in one of the most diverse and corrupt countries on earth, the Dominican Republic, I learned that those two things are color blind. The DR had a black president [Lilis] who turned into a dictator back in the late 1800s, so the history I grew up knowing was one where black men were skilled statesmen, feared military leaders, vanquishers of European armies, flawless, selfless martyrs, etc. When I moved to the US just before middle school, I definitely got less of that, but I didn't notice because I was so race blind. The only black men I remember learning about were MLK and Malcolm X and Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson. 

I do realize how privileged I am, because only 2% of Dominicans born in poverty move up the social ladder. Sometimes I take cold showers in the mornings here in my house in Europe just to remember was it was like back in the 'hood growing up.

8789,"The Constitution is absolutely a living, wonderful document, I'll give you that. It's one of the things I'm most proud of as an American. 

I was taught to trust the system, so I'm not blaming the Constitution, I brought it up more to highlight the fact that there's injustice written into the very foundation of our nation. Although the Civil Rights movement has made possible a black President and black attorney general and black ATF head, the US is still a very stratified society. Consider that the level of wealth inequality in NYC mirrors that of some African countries. People are waking up to the wealth inequality more than anything. 

I'm glad to learn that race relations are better than they were in the past, but I wish my parents had taught me mistrust of the system. There have been times when I trusted white police and my trust was stepped on and spit on, so I'm guarded not because of something that my father [whose father was a cop during a certain dictatorship that shall not be named] had taught me to keep my mouth shut around cops. Now, that's not to say that I would be less paranoid of a black cop in Puerto Rico, it's just that when someone has a gun and power, you either respect it or face it, especially when you're at the bottom of the social economic ladder, which a large percentage of black Americans are. 

As for the Shen Yun performance [I hope it was enjoyable,] I could tell you that last night I traveled to the city to party.

The system fuses the data from these three data streams to draw a bead on even stealthy aircraft.*

*If the United States, Russia, or China were ever stumble into a hot war, the F-35 and air defense systems like the Nebo-M would likely face off against one another. It’s yet more indication that EW, like cyber, is emerging as the next great arms race. But unlike previous arms competitions, adversary EW is advancing far faster than U.S. military acquisition programs can keep up.

Paywall:
*The treatment of the detained “left-wing activist” is the prologue to a Stasi state. The ongoing events surrounding the anti-occupation organizations is a witch-hunt. There is no other way to describe the madness of the campaigns Israel is waging other than in these harsh terms.*

*They are not exaggerations – prologue to a Stasi state and witch-hunt. The media is fanning the flames. The politicians are inciting, the authorities rejoice, most Israelis yawn and everyone is satisfied. A coalition of wall-to-wall satisfied people – the right, the center, the government, the security apparatus, the press and most citizens. It is a coalition that is foreign to democracy.*

*One day, when things get out of control, some of these groups will be sorry that they collaborated or stood by, but by then it will be too late. The fire will consume them, too. The facts that the Israel Bar Association did not announce a strike, journalist associations did not protest and law school faculty heads did not sign a petition proves how great the rift is.*

*A leftist activist is under scandalous arrest and is being held in scandalous conditions. His arrest at the airport as a fugitive – which is how the press presented it – though there was no restraining order against his leaving the country, tore a wide rift in the rule of law. When he was prohibited from meeting his attorney, as if he were a dangerous security detainee, a ticking time-bomb, a burner of babies in Duma, another brick fell from the flimsy wall of justice. The allegations against him are among the most preposterous ever seen here.*

*The Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court, collaborating with the security apparatus, extended his remand and approved – in alarming, automatic fashion – the police request to prohibit him from meeting a lawyer.*

*The main suspicion against him is maintaining contact with a foreign agent. That “foreign agent” is the Palestinian Authority’s security services, Israel’s security subcontractor. Can we expect a wave of arrests, without the right to see an attorney, of all the agents of Israel’s organizations of security and darkness, the IDF and the Shin Bet, who are in daily contact with those “foreign agents?”*

*Other suspicions against the “leftist activist” are based almost entirely on a TV “investigation” broadcast last week – accessory to manslaughter without anyone being killed, accessory to attempted murder without there being a murder, and even transporting an illegal resident, which is probably an offense deserving life imprisonment.*

*And as if that were not enough, Channel 2 television news delivered the gold-standard in evidence: He received 1,400 shekels ($355) from the non-profit organization Breaking the Silence. What did he receive it for? It doesn’t matter. It’s blood money. You had to see the spasm of revulsion on the face of Channel 2 anchor Danny Kushmaro when he read the sensational news.*

*A “leftist activist” is easy prey. He is merely an appetizer for the witch-hunters. Drunk with victory, their moles continue to stream more and more sensational proof from the basements of the target organizations.*

*Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper revealed Wednesday that Alon Liel, a former Foreign Ministry director general and ambassador to South Africa, had met with members of Breaking the Silence and given them a briefing.*

*Unbelievable! The secret recordings of the bold moles who crossed enemy lines, caught Liel on tape talking about what lessons to draw from the struggle against apartheid and how to prevent the appointment of Danny Dayan as ambassador to Brazil. If I were Liel, I would be planning for my arrest. It would not be much more baseless than the arrest of the “leftists activist.”*

*The media, which “doesn’t work for anyone,” in the words of the presenter of the TV “investigation,” is fanning these flames. The media, which doesn’t work for anyone, except for ratings, the ambition to curry favor, shameful cowardice and fascism, which has long been underway and whose thundering has now begun.*",2016-01-15 14:32:37+00:00,cyz78fr,1.0,t3_413azx,137.0,governmentoppression

People growing up with me generally only knew economic and technological progress in the face of peace. Even the episodes of The Simpsons, one where Bart joins a military academy, the general gives a speech about how America no longer fights wars and how all of them would one day be useless, replaced by robots who would do the fighting. The general said that we would simply be driving the robots. And although this is true to a certain extent with our drone program, 9/11 ripped that for people who were born at the start of the millennium. 

People born at the start of the millennium have only known war and fear of terror. They still believe in a future that is technologically marvelous, but usually most movies made lately are set in a future dystonia where civilization has collapsed ISIS-style. 

So, I imagined that 2016 would be a time of peace, where technology had eliminated the need for war and such. Now, though, I feel that 2016 is more like 1916, just around World War I, because there's so much tension in the world. The killing of one archduke, the beheading of one sheikh or imam, and the whole world bursts into even bigger flames.

9312,"Sorry about that, forgot about the paywall: Benzi Gopstein, leader of the extremist anti-assimilationist group Lehava, has called for the prevention of Christmas celebrations in Israel and the expulsion of Christians whom he compared to “vampires.”

“Christmas has no place in the Holy Land,” Gopstein wrote in an article posted a few days ago on the Haredi website Kooker.

The Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism has called on the prosecutor and the police to launch an investigation.

Gopstein wrote in the article that he is disturbed by “the fall of the line of defense of the Jewish people against our deadly enemy for hundreds of years – the Christian Church.”

He said the Church had used “the maximum tools at its disposal to destroy the Jewish people,” and that today “the Church has been defeated roundly when the Jewish people has one of the strongest armies in the world and they have no chance any longer of destroying our body.”

However, Gopstein said, the Church has not given up. “A last hope remains to those vampires and blood suckers – the mission. If Jews cannot be killed, they can still be converted.”

Gopstein said “missionary bookstores offer their products in front of everyone on Jaffa Road in Jerusalem, whole communities are crawling with missionaries, many businesses are run by them and are used by the mission, many cases using camouflage and without the knowledge of the employees.”

Gopstein said that the “fear that every Jew felt, the disgust that we described above at Christianity – disgust that was the only thing that saved us from the dark days in Europe – has disappeared with the ‘good life’ of the democratic age…and the missionary is on the prowl for prey.”

Gopstein ends his article by writing: “I call on everyone to raise a cry and fight this corrupt phenomenon in the best tradition of Judaism, before we all, including those who observe the commandments among us, become a community of sycophants.”

“Christmas has no place in the Holy Land,” he wrote, adding “Let us remove the vampires before they once again drink our blood.”

The Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism and the Coalition Against Racism have asked the deputy prosecutor for special functions, as well as the police unit in charge of cybercrime, to investigate. The movements wrote: “The article calls for the prevention of celebration of Christmas, the most important Christian holiday, and to work to remove Christians from Israel.” The groups also noted that Gopstein’s description of Christians as “vampires and blood-suckers” contravenes the law prohibiting insult to religious feelings.

“This statement was not made in a vacuum but in the context of many acts of violence against Christian clergy in recent years,” the groups wrote.

Orly Erez-Likhovski, head of the Reform center’s legal department said: “Benzi Gopstein stops at nothing to incite against anyone who is not him – Arab Muslims, Christians and others, using harsh language and calling for violence. Unfortunately…in the face of this incitement…law enforcement is thunderously silent.”

The center’s letter to the prosecution and the police joins a number of complaints against Gopstein that are still waiting to be dealt with. He is still being investigated for statements made in 2012 which became public when he was arrested together with other activists in December 2014, after Lehava members torched the bilingual school in Jerusalem. The findings were turned over to the prosecution in May. However, indictments have not been served, and according to a report earlier this week on Channel 10, it seems the case is going to be closed.

According to Channel 10, the evidence on which police based its recommendation to charge Gopstein included Facebook posts, text messages and WhatsUp conversations, which police claimed were racist in nature.

Among others, posts published on Gopstein's Facebook page included photos of Israeli Arab lawmakers doctored to seem like they were hanged from the neck, as well as calls against miscegenation and coexistence. However, the investigation showed that another person was publishing posts on Gopstein's page during his arrest, making it harder to prove that it was Gopstein who personally posted the questionable content.

The State Prosecutor's Office said it has received the groups' letter calling for an investigation into Gopstein's latest comments, and added that ""no decision has been made yet"" on the Lehava case.
