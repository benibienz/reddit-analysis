17,"The question is about cost, as it always is. The more you rely on a certain feature of a cloud provider, the more you save as they have solved the problem for you. But the harder it is to migrate away from the platform.

If you simply use IaaS as you describe, where you get a VM to do as you please, you aren't really using a modern cloud infrastructure. Today, you might buy a database, caching or messaging service from Amazon without hosting a single server or application yourself. However, if you wanted to buy the same services from Microsoft, you would have to build twice as much interfacing code and some kind of failover system, making your project three times as expensive at least.

For some projects, it will make financial sense to host them on public clouds but take the effort to develop them in such a way that they can move between competing public cloud providers instantly. But you do have to understand that such a project will be far more expensive than simply hosting a JavaEE-Application on Openshift or a Django app on Heroku.

They did decouple the physics simulation from the graphics drawing. This is not the issue here at all.

&gt;  If you can't assure a reasonable accuracy over long time steps, YOU DON'T STEP THAT LONG.

If you don't step that long, KSP would be unplayable. It would be fine during launch, but far too slow during long orbital maneuvers.

44,"&gt; Decoupling simulation rate from frame rate is a beginner thing in game design. There is really no excuse for a simulation heavy game to couple the two.

It's not framerate, it's simulation tick rate. 

The thing with KSP is that during launch, sub-second simulation ticks are needed. And during orbital transfers, you want to calculate entire years quickly.

It's not feasible to have sub-second simulation ticks and display the game sped-up thousands of times. Not because the graphics won't keep up, but because the physics simulation won't keep up. So if you speed up the game, they use less game ticks per time unit, and extrapolate from physical formulas more.

Say you know the formula for an orbit. Then you can calculate the position of the bodies at any point in time easily. But doing the same for a launch, were the structure of the ship is being bounced about by air and acceleration, increasing the time distance between game ticks might easily have an effect on the outcome.",2016-05-07 02:59:59+00:00,d2vz718,5.0,t1_d2vtmko,10222.0,gamedev

I object to seriously thinking about whether the ship is still the ship when it gets replaced. The concept of the ship was simply a working abstraction for thinking and communicating. It is meaningless outside of our thoughts or communications. It seems silly to me to arbitrarily create a segmentation of the universe that is ill-defined (as it has no temporal dimension) and then try to find a flaw in ones own segmentation by abusing that it is ill-defined.

The universe is a continuous expanse of probability functions.

They are just abstractions in the pattern recognition system that is our mind. Reasoning about their identity or other properties is meaningless - they only exist as patterns in our minds.

Asking questions like ""is this abstraction the same as that abstraction"" ist just playing games with the abstractions in our mind. It seems a modern intellectual will have no doubt about that the patterns in their mind are simply patterns and arguing about them is not useful to learn about the universe.

It seems that taking these patterns from our minds, using them as axioms and using rationality to try to derive truths is a very, very flawed concept. And to me, the question on the ship of Theseus is exactly that. ",2015-08-27 10:17:08+00:00,cuhawbm,1.0,t3_3ik2d9,22278.0,askphilosophy

It's not really a problem though. Well, it is if you are thinking in human timescales. If we transition to a form of life that is not restricted in lifespan biologically, nothing says that waiting a couple million years doesn't make sense for an intelligent being.

We are very small and fast, compared to the universe. Doing something like travelling to another galaxy is an action on a different scale than we live our lives, so it needing a different scale of time is no problem in my view.

This might also be a reason for the Fermi paradox. We assume that alien life that spans across galaxies communicates on a similar timeframe than we do.

But it's also that the products they selected are ones they know well, and will vouch for. Many people don't want to spend time working with materials they haven't chosen and are likely the cheapest the customer found on the internet. It might mean they are harder to work with or more likely to break, and even if everything goes well they don't want to be part of a quality of service that doesn't match their standard.

Just have a company to full service. It will establish a good relationship with them, you will have less hassle, the end result will probably be better, and it probably won't be that much more expensive. ",2015-08-04 12:13:57+00:00,ctr01by,3.0,t1_ctqunhd,19930.0,askswitzerland

* Blick
* Tages Anzeiger
* Berner Zeitung
* Der Bund
* Neue Zürcher Zeitung
* Neue Luzerner Zeitung
* St. Galler Tagblatt
* Basler Zeitung

Dann noch den RSS-Feed von SRF, auch wenn's keine Zeitung ist. Ich finde, das gibt einen guten Überblick. Und den Blick mag ich in der Liste, gerade weil es mir sonst niemals in den Sinn kommen würde ihn zu lesen. Immerhin lesen ihn viele Leute.

/r/chpresseschau soll ein bisschen wie ein /r/all der Inlandpresse sein. Und da gehört der Blick dazu, finde ich.

As far as I understand Heroku, it counts the sum of running time. So it doesn't matter when your program is running, it just has a max running time per 24 hours.

179,"You are so right it hurts! Döner in Switzerland is terrible. A few years ago, I travelled in Eurpe a bit with Interrail, making a point to eat a Döner in every town I travelled to. Just a few kilometers across the border to France or Germany, they have fresh bread that they toast well, meat fresh from the grill, homemade sauces, fresh salad. And they put them together like they actually give a fuck: Some sauce on the bread first, them some meat, some veggies, more meat, more veggies and top it off with not to much sauce.

Come back home, and it's shitty industrial bread, barely toasted with meat from the warming bin and sauces that are bought from cash &amp; carry. And they just randomly slap the stuff together. It's absolutely terrible!

And the meat! Almost all Döner places here have minced meat on their Döner rather than real slabs of meat laid on top of each other.

I dream of getting good Döner in Switzerland!

The only passable place in Berne is King's Kebab, the little white house in the intersection by the Lorraine bus stop. Nice guys, properly toasted bread, and real meat slabs so the meat has the proper texture. But they also do the warming box thing, and the sauce is kind of bland.

Fast- and streetfood is generally terrible in Switzerland though. People who sell it mostly give no fucks about their product. It's a discrace.
