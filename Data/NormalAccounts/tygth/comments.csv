What kind  of workout ? ",2016-11-13 08:11:37+00:00,d9y8uqz,2,t1_d9y8982,1778,ftm
12,"Have you tried to observe if there was anything different after the 3 weeks mark ? 
3months on t is pretty short amount of time. But yeah, still . i think i see some muscle difference ? But since my weight isnt going down ( which would make sence as i'm gaining muscle?) I really dont think i'm losing belly fat and i hate it :P. I'm sure you'll find a way to start gaining as well . ",2016-11-13 07:10:59+00:00,d9y7jjw,2,t1_d9y6p80,1885,ftm
13,Totaly normal. Went thru that too . i freaked out and almost walked out the endo's office. It's been 2 months now and seeing hair growing on my face is making me so happy. Message me if you need to talk!,2016-11-08 17:20:21+00:00,d9rb45m,1,t3_5bt9j2,12826,ftm

17,"Facial yes, sorry. 
I don't mind the 'pornstache' or whatever people call it. Sometime people stare, but mostly because they don't know i'm trans. I want it thick and dark, so i heard i should shave . but it's so damn scary !i'd post a picture but apparently i cant ?",2016-10-24 02:19:29+00:00,d952dm3,2,t1_d9526zo,281,ftm
18,"I'm a month and a half on T. Still using my birth name in public. I try to ask people not to use feminine pronouns tho. I just feel like it wouldn't match to get a male name while i'm still kinda looking like a female and not 100% out to everybody. 
I'd love to share more, msg me if you want !",2016-10-14 04:14:42+00:00,d8rbyca,1,t3_57ej0r,1168,ftm
19,"Gain are tiny. Like 5 pounds last week. I'm just curious about the 'losing belly' part lol . this is so annoying i feel like a 5 years old kid with a belly and cheeks meanwhile i'm 25. It's only cute when you're a kid. Yes i'm on T since a month and a half. Just really depressive about this whole ' i dont know when the weight will be muslce and not fat ' i do work out a lot the muscle. Hit the bike everyday too. It just looks like i'll be stuck with that belly forever lol
Thanks for the answers tho",2016-10-12 17:46:53+00:00,d8p2o2y,1,t3_5751qe,3926,ftm

21,"Tyce. I always wanted to pick Tyler , but it sounded weird after i tried it out. Then i ended up with Tyce as my best friend's suggestion",2016-09-17 06:07:25+00:00,d7qa4z7,1,t3_5345gd,32090,ftm
22,"I Always loved Tyler. I kinda tried it out, and as soon as someone called me like this it turned me off pretty fast. Then i started to think about only Ty. But rralised it was short and weird  with my last name. Now i'm kinda into Tyce. My best friend suggested it. I think since you can chose your name , might as well take time to think about it. I don't think there's a need to rush !",2016-09-15 16:24:47+00:00,d7nz657,1,t3_52w6r3,9836,ftm
23,"I felt the same . i was scared , freaking out. Kept thinking maybe i was wrong , maybe the issue wasnt being a girl , maybe there was other options. Saw my Endo on a monday , he told me to come back on the wednesday to get the shot and teach me. I wasnt ready, i was expecting some more time before the appointment and the shot. I was expecting to start later in September and ibwas ok with that. I actually started on August 31st.  I wanted to cancell the appointment.. And then i thought "" if i don't do it now , i'll never be ready and i'll never do it."" I did my second shot this week and i'm feeling pretty good. Come talk to me if you want , i'd love to share more !",2016-09-12 01:36:07+00:00,d7j0a0v,1,t3_52b26r,11643,ftm

28,"Sorry my French didn't help to write a proper sentence . You answered good tho, so thank you! 
It wasn't so much about losing weight, more about how true is the building muscle would help getting rid of the fat",2016-07-07 21:42:30+00:00,d53eu49,4,t1_d53ahbq,5455,ftm
29,"Well I heard  multiple time that it was easier to build muscle (so lose weight) while on T. Guys are obviously losing weight easier than girls. So yeah, the question was pretty much if its gonna be easier to build muscle and get rid of fat. Looks like some people were seeing this question in a total different way. I'm just wondering if you really do build more which I know helps losing fat. I am on a bike 40 mins a day and usually lift 35-45 mins a day but as i'm not on T, it's difficult to see results",2016-07-07 19:28:33+00:00,d5389xr,2,t1_d52os6z,27323,ftm
