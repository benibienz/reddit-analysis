I'm that kind of person who always wanted to lose that old kid belly of mine. I'm also the one who wants to gain muscle. I'm having a hard time motivating myself since everytime i tried , nothing really changed . I'm not eating sugar/fat in general. I'm lifting weights pretty much everyday. I might eat bigger portions than what i should , which i'm already working on . I also realise that my body react different because of the testosterone, which is why i'm posting here , and not on the lose it reddit. I usually work out at home, and i don't know why but i lose my motivation really fast when i don't see any result, and this is mentally affecting me a lot. I'm just wondering , any of you can share weight loss / muscle gain story that would maybe help? I've tried so many things, i feel like i might be forgetting someting , and this belly will just be the death of me.

What's the best way that you guys found to get rid of some extra pounds ? I feel like i'm getting more muscular which mean that if i'm losing fat i don't see it and it's driving me nuts. I've always had couple of extra pounds and good muscle shapes, so now i'm working on seeing more muscle than fat. Any suggestion? I do work out between  1hr and 1.5 hours a day and eat pretty good ( same tuna/rice/veggie ) everyday..

My therapist said one thing tho, and i think that's pretty smart. She mentionned how being surrounded by other tran guy could help feel less ""alone""  and talking with people who went thru the same can be very helpful.
