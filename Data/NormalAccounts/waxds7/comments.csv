Keep in mind that since GE and Silver 1 are on the ends, the actual ratings under those ranks extend out much further.

Just proves that you like to talk out your ass because you don't know if that is true, all valve has said is that they use a modified Glicko-2 system (which isn't even ELO) so your point shouldn't be listened to.

Finally they changed how much time you have in a round (which the community wanted) but instead of changing to 1:45 round with a 35 second bomb timer they implemented 1:55 round with 40 second bomb timer, they are also enforcing this ruleset at the Major tournaments.
