Motofire.com is owned and run by two guys with over 18 years in the motorcycle industry, we are both well known so don't struggle with getting to the right people.
It's not about trying to sell ads for us right now, its about being out there and making people aware of our presence, we can't stand out without content sadly. To be ""relevant"" we must create regular and differing content otherwise the Google rankings never change and we'd get swamped.
We just want to build a motorcycling site that motorcyclists like to visit. We're not even bothered if its via Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube or any other platform, as long as people want to get involved.
The money can come later and we're not trying to flog it for ever penny, a wage and a passion to feed, that'll do :)

1,"You're kinda missing the point. Without creating the content, start up sites like ours won't create the traffic. This way we beat the other to it, provide a different way of supplying content and build a reader base that starts to get us on launches. Its a chicken and egg situation.

Our site looks a lot better and works a lot better than some of the largest players, now we need to get the content supply running.
That takes time but we are getting there!

Readers like yourself help by being engaged, positive or negative it all help the conversation whihc ultimately grows our brand.

Hope this makes sense :/",2016-03-09 13:52:20+00:00,d0tc3a1,4,t1_d0tajo2,3696,motorcycles
2,"No, its a meta review, people come to our site because they like what we do and how we do it but we don't get invited on all the launches.
So we beat the others at their own game by producing a meta review. That way you have something to read about content we wouldn't usually get.",2016-03-09 09:04:21+00:00,d0t6wa6,2,t1_d0snf95,36362,motorcycles
