80,"&gt;The schools I would apply to using Questbridge have better financial aid policies than Questbridge itself (regarding full rides and general aid)

This is a common misconception. Questbridge does not give you the scholarship, the school you match to does.

Additionally, if you're on the higher end of the QB gradient and are applying to MIT: I do actually suggest you do the Common App.

123,"&gt;It will mean you possess the drive and dedication to complete something academically rigorous and won't be just a glorified high school diploma.

[But this isn't true,](http://i.imgur.com/FX4TxtX.png)[ and graduating college does mean something...](http://i.imgur.com/0os2lSw.png) Even today a college degree offers a hell of a lot more opportunities than a high school degree. Whether you're working at Starbucks or a high-profile publication has less to do with a devaluation of a college degree (which is happening, I won't deny that) and more to do with networking acumen, internships, extracurricular involvement and everything else that makes a solid resume.

You're still glossing over the fact that the largest private aid sources don't function without FAFSA. Gates Millenium, HSF, UNCF, and all the major private aid institutions need the FAFSA system to administer aid. School also need it to determine need, even for privately awarded aid from the school's endowment completely separate from government funds. It's a necessary tool that's facilitated by a connection to the IRS and Social Security, and getting rid of it would cause a weird gray area where there is no longer an explicitly marked Pell Grant benchmark.

Additionally, you're assuming that college tuition would naturally decrease. This is a bit of a gray area as well, and has more to do with what sort of economic theory you align with the most but I personal belief that college tuition is a ""sticky"" cost in our economy: that is, it won't shift easily even though economic demand/supply theory demands that it will. If it does shift, it will be over a long timespan meaning that for several years tuition will neither decrease nor will there by public funds for those academic years for poor students. This would be a huge problem.

I agree that education in the US is markedly fucked, but a sweeping dissolved of public aid and the FAFSA framework is not the answer.",2016-07-29 21:44:41+00:00,d5wgcsb,9.0,t1_d5wfjze,1177.0,pics

&gt;**These are the conditions of the Olympic Village that athletes are calling ""inhabitable"".**

&gt;Ten days away from the start of the Games in Rio, several groups have abandoned the buildings due to the poor state they are currently in.

&gt;The 5th of August will mark the inauguration of the first Olympic Games held in South America. Regardless, the organizational problems that have been presented in Brazil have been the main focus of the event thus far.

&gt;The Olympic Village, a place where athletes and media groups are housed during the Games, is currently the center of criticisms from athletes who have already arrived to Rio.

&gt;""It is inhabitable"" have said the Australian athletes, who first attempted to live in the Olympic Village but later felt obliged to settle at a nearby hotel.

&gt;The Argentinian team followed suit, yet later promised to return to the village once construction was finished.

&gt;The Olympic committee recognized that these issues exist, but promised to solved them in the 10 days leading up to the games (lol!!).

&gt;This Monday, the Belorussians published some images of the poor conditions in which they found themselves housed and the Swedes decides to move to another venue until these problems were solved.

&gt;The athletes themselves took to social media and posted dozens of photos in which leaks, exposed wiring, and even holes in the roof may be observed.

&gt;Additionally, athletes noted that not even the floors nor the windows of the venue were clean and warned incoming athletes that a lack of warm water is a constant issue.

&gt;""We have 630 workers working 24 hours a day to fix the problems in the Olympic Village and will be able to present the village to incoming athletes in **impeccable conditions** (rofl) before the end of next week, probably by Thursday"", assured the director of Communications of the Rio 2016 Committee, Mario Andrada.",2016-07-27 14:30:12+00:00,d5sz99k,1.0,t3_4uugkr,5698.0,apocalympics2016

* The novelty of your research.

249,"&gt;Do you have any suggestions for possible high-profile societies where I could present verbally or with a poster? How could I go about getting a verbal presentation at somewhere prestigious or at a conference?

Since you're doing the research independent of a college, it would be difficult. It's easier when you already know a member of an academic society (by this I mean ACS, BPS, AMA, etc) because the college will often pay for the registration/submission fees. Otherwise, it could get expensive. I don't think it's worth it in your case unless you're working in a supervised lab soon and have peers to attend the conference with you, especially since I think it's an event that should be enjoyed. If you're still interested, you'd have to go through the registration and submit an abstract - the reason I say a verbal presentation is a big deal is they're rarely given to undergrads, let alone high school students and you would probably need institutional/school backing for a successful application.

&gt;I considered Siemens, but never got into it, maybe I should look more at that competition.

Relevant snippet: 

&gt;Findings

&gt;We estimated that 35 abortions (90% uncertainty interval [UI] 33 to 44) occurred annually per 1000 women aged 15–44 years worldwide in 2010–14, which was 5 points less than 40 (39–48) in 1990–94 (90% UI for decline −11 to 0). Because of population growth, the annual number of abortions worldwide increased by 5·9 million (90% UI −1·3 to 15·4), from 50·4 million in 1990–94 (48·6 to 59·9) to 56·3 million (52·4 to 70·0) in 2010–14. In the developed world, the abortion rate declined 19 points (−26 to −14), from 46 (41 to 59) to 27 (24 to 37). In the developing world, we found a non-significant 2 point decline (90% UI −9 to 4) in the rate from 39 (37 to 47) to 37 (34 to 46). **Some 25% (90% UI 23 to 29) of pregnancies ended in abortion in 2010–14.** Globally, 73% (90% UI 59 to 82) of abortions were obtained by married women in 2010–14 compared with 27% (18 to 41) obtained by unmarried women. We did not observe an association between the abortion rates for 2010–14 and the grounds under which abortion is legally allowed.

Explanation: the figure for abortion rate you cite in your title is 25 per 1000 **women of reproductive age**, not 25 per 1000 **pregnancies.** Obviously, not every woman of reproductive age is pregnant.

&gt;During production of the film, actress Samantha Morton performed the role of Samantha by acting on set ""in a four-by-four carpeted soundproof booth made of black painted plywood and soft, noise-muffling fabric"". At Jonze's suggestion, she and Joaquin Phoenix avoided seeing each other on set during filming.[23] Morton was later replaced by Scarlett Johansson. Jonze explained: ""It was only in post production, when we started editing, that we realized that what the character/movie needed was different from what Samantha and I had created together. So we recast and since then Scarlett has taken over that role.""[24] Jonze met Johansson in the spring of 2013 and worked with her for four months.[14][22] Following the recast, new scenes were shot in August 2013, which were either ""newly imagined"" or ""new scenes that I had wanted to shoot originally but didn't"".[22]",2016-02-19 20:37:25+00:00,d06ac83,1.0,t3_46ml68,982.0,todayilearned

496,"&gt;On June 18, 1964, black and white protesters jumped into the whites-only pool at the Monson Motor Lodge in St. Augustine, Fla. In an attempt to force them out, the owner of the hotel poured acid into the pool.

&gt;Martin Luther King Jr. had planned the sit-in during the St. Augustine Movement, a part of the larger civil rights movement. The protest — and the owner's acidic response — is largely forgotten today, but it played a role in the passing of the Civil Rights Act, now celebrating its 50th anniversary.

&gt;J.T. Johnson, now 76, and Al Lingo, 78, were two of the protesters in the pool that day. On a visit to StoryCorps in Atlanta, the pair recalled the hotel owner, James Brock, ""losing it.""

&gt;""Everybody was kind of caught off guard,"" J.T. says.

&gt;""The girls, they were most frightened, and we moved to the center of the pool,"" Al says.

&gt;""I tried to calm the gang down. I knew that there was too much water for that acid to do anything,"" J.T. says. ""When they drug us out in bathing suits and they carried us out to the jail, they wouldn't feed me because they said I didn't have on any clothes. I said, 'Well, that's the way you locked me up!'

&gt;""But all of the news media were there, because somehow I guess they'd gotten word that something was going to happen at that pool that day. And I think that's when President [Lyndon B.] Johnson got the message.""

&gt;The following day, the Civil Rights Act was approved, after an 83-day filibuster in the U.S. Senate.

&gt;""That had not happened before in this country, that some man is pouring acid on people in the swimming pool,"" J.T. says. ""I'm not so sure the Civil Rights Act would have been passed had [there] not been a St. Augustine. It was a milestone. We was young, and we thought we'd done something — and we had.""

&gt;""There were too many requirements that went against my instincts for character,"" he adds. ""I've been spoiled. I've never had to make those compromises. I've not met a director yet with one of those films where we go through the script, they say: 'You know what, fuck this set-piece, let's focus on the character!' I understand, but it's best I don't do it.""

&gt;While it's seemingly unlikely that we'll ever spot Phoenix in an effects-laden popcorn movie, he'll happily fork out for a ticket. ""I enjoy watching those movies. Did you see the rebooted Star Trek? That kid Chris Pine who plays Kirk is fucking genius. I just don’t know if I want to have the experience of being in them.""

823,"The belief that ingesting very dangerous chemical compounds, like toxins or strong electrolytes, in minuscule portions actually has positive health benefits. For example, a popular homeopathy potion in the UK 30x 10% diluted bleach; people claim it will cures chronic diseases. It's dangerous bullshit because 1) if you do successfully dilute 10% bleach 30 times you've diluted it so many times past Avagrado's constant that you'd technically be more likely to be struck by lightning nine times on separate occasions than to find a single molecule of bleach in a 100mL sample 2) if you don't successfully dilute the bleach and instead ingest a considerable amount of bleach, you literally just killed yourself.

Because it's diluted so many times, a company can package a homeopathic bleach solution that it actually just water because the likelihood of there being bleach in a 30x 10% solution is so low that it might as well be water. The business is then, essentially, packaging placebo medicines that are actually just water or something not harmful and labeling it as homeopathic because and then overcharging by several orders of magnitude. People who participate in homeopathy will often choose it over actual medicine; then they die, because, as previously stated, it's fucking bullshit.

This is an actual [homepathic product.](https://www.homeopathic.com/cms-global/shoppingcart/ViewProduct.do?productId=1493) These are marketed as 30C dilution, which in homeopathy means 60x dilution. That means that there's one molecule of the marketed compound for every 10^60 molecules of the surrounding vessel substance. To highlight how absurd this number is, the entire Earth is composed of around 1.5x10^50 atoms.

864,"For the first question: there's a lot of ways to investigate protein-protein binding, my lab uses fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry(ITC). It will vary on the protein(s) you're studying and the sort of investigation being done. If they want to see the affinity of the bond between the two proteins, they might do calorimetry; or they might use another method, it varies on a lab-to-lab basis. 

For the second question: if they want to study the role of these proteins on an entire organism, they could find an animal that expresses this protein (mice are common) and genetically engineer four generations of mice: one expressing protein A, one expressing protein B, one expressing protein A and B and a ""knockout"" generation expression neither (KO) and then see what happens. You could also design a molecular assay where you monitor human cells over-expressing or under-expressing either protein and study the effects this has on the expression of other proteins or macromolecules within the cells. Maybe having too much of protein A will cause there to be less protein C, and you know the function of protein C but not of A. But by knowing that they are related, you can gain insight into the significance of protein A, which you are studying. Once you get a general idea, you might look to mutate the protein just to see which bits of the protein are most important; you could do random mutations with many, many trials on a huge assay or you could run a computational model to pinpoint specific amino acids of interest and focus on those. Again, varies by lab. 

At least this is more or less how we investigated the functions of the protein-group I work with, but since I don't know what this particular person is studying I could be completely off the mark. Oh well.

Anyways, the main challenge with this functional study is that this is the *developing* heart, which gives a very small window to work with and an equally delicate environment to study. ",2015-08-22 01:58:20+00:00,cubdse9,3.0,t1_cub9prr,7731.0,AskReddit

940,"There are hundreds, if not thousands, of ways to describe the beauty of the mountains, or the night sky, or the face of one who finally embraces a lover after months away from home due to unforeseen circumstances. Words like enchanting, breathtaking, ethereal, and serene may be used to describe the picturesque lake that you visited in your childhood. The phantasmal fog which skated across the normally glistening water would send chills down your spine while inducing a feeling of tranquility throughout your quiescent body as you watched. Reminiscing on those halcyon days of the past may generate feelings of sorrow as you are unable to chase the nostalgia which those distant memories bring about. Despite the longing for a more welcoming past, you continue on with your existence as if you were oblivious to the ever changing reality of the situation. You welcome your foreign future with open arms as if you had some esoteric knowledge of what's to come; thus, you are an anomaly. In your current self; resplendent, heavenly, exquisite, and mystifying, do no justice to describe you. Your perplex personality and actions leave witnesses in awe. Despite the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of words, in the English language, no set of diction and vocabulary can describe you. The roaring peaks of the Himalayas, the hostile landscape of the arctic, and the stupefying scenery of the Amazon can be put into words, but you are more than just bewildering, exalted, or illustrious; it is difficult to convey in words, which limit the imagination and feelings that one holds, what you are. The English language, no, all means of human communication shackle the thoughts we hold and only serve to create an illusion which can only communicate a portion of our true thoughts.

My father grew up in a 3rd-world beach town, where everyone knew everyone and everyone knew the beach. It was common to go for late night and early morning swims, sometimes even alone, though this was generally condemned as stupid by the community. Anyways, one time a local boy decides to go for an early morning swim and just never came back. No washed up body, no remains; he just disappeared into the far ocean after announcing that he'd go for a swim. And his mother, a single mother, was absolutely devastated. As a functioning individual she completely crumbled. Every morning she cooked the boy breakfast, laid out his clothes and waited for him to come back from the beach. Every school morning she woke up early, as to wake him and prepare him for school. And she did this every day until she died an early death, presumably of grief, that poor woman. Everyone knew about it, everyone tried to help by keeping her financially afloat since she no longer worked, but it was beyond salvageable.

943,"I like to think that I am a good student, so when my physics professor dropped my grade from a 98% to a 72% by grading my final exam as a 0%, with no explanation, I was a little uncomfortable. ""So I'll go bring it up during office hours"" I thought, naively. For four days I went to office hours, where I sat outside his door for a combined total of 8 hours and 20 minutes, and for four days he never came. So by this point my attention had been fully monopolized by this man. Because he wouldn't come to me, during office hours, and because I had about 24 hours before the grades closed I did the only logical thing: I stalked him on Facebook until I found his personal phone number and address. 

I don't think he expected to do anything else that day but sit on his ass and watch CSI. He was instantly confused and asked how I got his number; I said that really didn't matter, what mattered was my grade. I was honestly too upset to really consider the gravity of what I was doing (stalking, harassment? I really don't know), but whatever I said through the phone definitely convinced him to find my paper and give me my earned grade. He avoids me in the halls now, which is fine because he physically repulses me.

982,"Because it's standard in US demographics to include that group and it's faster than having to individually add up all the percentages to realize that the Pacific Islander population is 0.00%

If I don't see it, I assume they didn't get that statistic until I count up all the percentages and even then they might have rolled them into the ""Others"" categories. Now I'm left with an ambiguous case of simply not knowing the percentage of the Pacific Islander population. So to save everyone time and effort, they just state it how it is: ""0.0% Pacific Island"".",2015-06-25 00:59:09+00:00,cshqhpb,6.0,t1_cshoc94,3842.0,WTF

985,"1) I'm asking for the source for the entire map.

2) Two Korean teams, MVP.Phoenix and MVP.Hot6ix, are going to be competing at The International 5. Other notable Nexus/KDL competing teams are, until recently as some have disbanded: Pokerface, Rave (compete in Korea, actually from Philippines) and Lotem. There's a couple more and I'd estimate the scene to have about 10-ish teams that actively compete in KDL. 

Korea has been getting stronger, dominating the TI5 Quals. ",2015-06-19 21:18:51+00:00,cscajai,5.0,t1_csc9z9a,983.0,GlobalOffensive

987,"&gt;I think it has the problem that there just aren't a lot of very good players going there

I disagree. They have a system for designating high-skill coaches and contributors, the gold flair for the best of the best, and often exceptionally high MMR/leaderboard players will drop by to give input about specific heroes. Responding to the OP of the comment chain, I'd say it's not a matter of ""circlejerk"", it's a matter of mods who do their job of removing and banning flamers and toxic posters, which is admittedly easier to do in a sub of manageable size like /r/learndota2
