&gt; Caltech students have long been known for their quirky sense of humor, whether it be through planning creative pranks, building elaborate party sets, or even the year-long preparation that goes into our annual Ditch Day. Please describe an unusual way in which you have fun. (200 word max)

I was born in Venezuela, a country that people tend to know so little about that they forget it exists. But the one thing people do remember is the wonderful food, so the common question I get is: can this guy cook me some saucy Venezuelan cuisine? Claro que si, señor! I’m not only an experimenter in the lab, but I’m a well-seasoned kitchen veteran who loves to try out new recipes whenever he has the thyme. I’m an ardent defender of keeping my avocados constant when preparing *reina pepiada* arepas for a smooth, pleasant texture. And as for desserts, I’ve got my *quesillo* recipe down to a formula: the less time the batter is kept boiling in *“el baño maria”*, the smoother the end result is. I call this inverse relationship Boil’s Law, which can be expressed as S¹ T¹=S² T².

In a way, the kitchen is my lab away from the lab: I get to experiment all the time, present my work for peer review, and eventually something will go wrong. But the greatest chefs and scientists are those who can turn a mistake into something great, and that’s a virtue I’ve carried from the kitchen to my research.
