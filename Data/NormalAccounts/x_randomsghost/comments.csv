7,"My advice is please don't kill yourself. Here are a few things that i hope can help and if you do just wanna talk, please dont hesitate to contact me through a message and/or speak to someone.

Here are a few pointers that may kick start what you need to:

* Firstly, get tested. It isn't cheap it can be up to £200 but overall, completely worth it as it can get you help and the support you require. 
* Secondly, make sure you get the support you need whether this be through mentors, support workers or just friends and family. In the UK if you are planning on attending university you can apply for Disability student allowance (DSA) which can pay for support. [DSA](https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowances-dsas/overview)
* Thirdly, you will just eventually get used to being dyslexic. 
* Fourthly, try and contact a few companies specialising in dyslexia. They can probably support you and show you where to go.
* Is it a bitch to have? Yes. Can you deal with it? Yes. 
* Does it get frustrating? Yes. Again, can you deal with it? Yes. 

Overall everything does work out but you have to make sure that you are prepared for a big battle because it wont be easy but worth it because it will be able to help you progress through life.

48,It was an interesting episode but nothing interesting really happened apart from the mention of Sherlock's mother. It was a nice little filler episode for the season and I can't wait to see what the rest of the season holds.,2015-11-21 10:54:33+00:00,cx7vkn5,1,t3_3tivh6,112510,elementary
49,"It is definitely an interesting article to read. I have seen that they have done the Elementary vs Sherlock very well and have stated clearly what points are weaker and stronger. The article though hasn't gone into much detail about other differences like production value/times/length/writing of the season for example. I haven't stated actors because i think to be honest the right actors were chosen for both series. Both Sherlocks/John/Joan are brilliant. 

Because the article doesnt mention things like product value/times/length it does effect both shows in different ways. For example with Elementary we see/explore the backgrounds of each of the characters in a lot of different ways because we have more showtime however, in Sherlock we are limited to three episodes and even with them being an hour long we still dont see much details/background of the characters. We all know who Sherlock Holmes is but it is necessarily explored while Elementary choosing both the book and their own twist on the characters can do explore everything about the book and characters.

At the moment, i do still prefer Elementary over Sherlock. The reason behind is that Sherlock i wouldnt say has the better writing/actors/production value but it does have the better arcs in a sense that you are guessing (a lot more) throughout the three episodes to see overall who is the villain. Mainly that Sherlock you have to wait a year to three episodes or one in case of this year at Christmas while Elementary do 22/23 episodes in 9 months (dont quote me!). Some of the episodes because of this are very filler and are just there to fill the season but even with the minor filler episodes you can see the relationship between the characters develop. Having the twist with some of the characters with them being female in my opinion is more interesting then Sherlock because as the article stated in the season 1 finale, Joan 'the mascot' seen who Irene/Moriarty not Sherlock because she was a woman which again, we havent really seen in Sherlock.

I don't think Fuego Leon is dead but there is a lot of blood so he may be out for a while or something or unable to use magic again. Story wise it would be more interesting if he did die because then we can see what the after effects of him dying would do to the rest of the squads and the kingdom itself and maybe the revenge story begins or an arc of training to get more powerful?

75,I think it depends on your viewpoint. For example Naruto Gaiden was only 10 chapters long and that is now finished so that can be considered a reread. While Black Clover is currently 31 chapters long and hasn't finished so yes. It can be considered a refresh more then a reread. I said reread as it is easier in the long run of things. ,2015-09-30 15:48:01+00:00,cvjdqzi,4,t1_cvjbojv,3106,BlackClover

I have been playing fully since Friday and so far have been playing it for about 4-5 hours and sometimes longer over the weekend and hopefully gonna continue after work.

82,"I use a Benq XL2420T and it works awesome. I prefer it then a TV to be honest. The only issue I have is sound. I use an HDMI cable for connection but the monitor itself doesn't have any speakers so for example a game like Splatoon where the sound is not available through the game pad, it does get very annoying. I am gonna invest in a new monitor for my Wii U and my PC so I can have dual monitors and then a spare monitor for my PC overall. 

My only recommendation is to get a monitor with speakers if you arent too fussed about sound quality for the Wii U. I used to use a headset for the Wii U but then i began to use Skype and i dont have any speakers for my PC. So two headsets doesn't work but then I had the problem with games like Splatoon where they don't have the sound available through the gamepad so i am using in ear headphones to solve this issue but now the problem is, it gets very uncomfortable very fast.

My recommendation for fixing your monitor is possibly doing the basic troubleshooting problems so for example check the cable isn't dodgy (i dont think it would be a problem but no harm in trying if you have a spare handy), updating the firmware behind it and googling? Sorry i aint much help! ",2015-09-06 19:19:46+00:00,cuspvd5,1,t3_3ju1t6,43615,wiiu

89,"The deal is we still arent sure whether it is a relapse or not. I mean at the moment all we know that he disappeared for two days. I will admit this is hinting towards a lapse but, they needed to introduce a relapse at one point so this may be good timing to do it now then into later on in the seasons with everyone asking ""What about a lapse, he is druggie"" etc.

They had to introduce his father at one point and take a different angle because even in the books, his family apart from his brother wasn't mentioned much so it is interesting to have this different angle of the series. And most likely, they needed to appear difference to its UK counter part.

1. Clicker Heroes - like Cookie Clicker so you can just click a bit then leave it for 24 hours or two days.
