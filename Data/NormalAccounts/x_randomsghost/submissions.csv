I have been playing Orcs must Die! Unchained recently however, i do appear to be having problems with my graphics card. It is a NVIDIA GeForce 980 but recently it has been popping up with this error message:

Application SpitfireGame.e has been blocked from accessing Graphics hardware. Along with the graphics driver has crashed and has now been recovered message.

I don't get it for every game just this game. While im playing it only appears to be doing well in (unfortunately). Google searching at the moment has shown no luck on results which i am still trying.

No other game has been crashing apart from this one and i was wondering if anyone has had the same problem and has any known solution to overcome this problem. 

Thanking you!

Holmes attempts to rebuild his life in the wake of his attack on Oscar and subsequent relapse. Due to his violent actions, Sherlockâ€™s partnership with Watson and their consultancy with the NYPD are in jeopardy. As he awaits news on whether or not he will face criminal charges, the case of a missing woman allegedly killed by her husband lands in his lap, just in time to distract him from the impending arrival of his estranged father, Mr. Morland Holmes (new cast member John Noble). @Elementary_CBS


Is anyone else a little bit excited that it is returning finally?! This sounds like a good opening of Season 4 considering we didn't know what happened during the two days that he went missing it might be interesting to see what he did and what effects it has on the relationship with both Watson and NYPD itself. PLUS! As bonus we get to see Sherlock (possibly?) freak out a little bit about the arrival of his father (John Noble).
