So I think something is starting to blossom between me and this girl. We are going to a show on Tuesday in NYC. We have only known each other for a month and it seems to be going well. We haven't officially gone out together yet. We will be home by Wednesday morning. I am taking her 4 hrs away from home and she told me her mom will be coming to meet me tomorrow at my job.
