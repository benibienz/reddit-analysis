0,"If I were Scott, I would make an update where you have different levels for each gameplay aspect. Like with Wario Ware where you can play each microgame with growing difficulty. And it's ADDICTIVE.
Or put some hard-mode... Whatever.
If the theory that Sister Location is just all a big experiment is true (supported by the fact that Baby says ""I remember this scenario"" and then tells you just what HandyUnit will say after (if Baby==HandyUnit==Ennard is not true)), each level could be a different victim of the Sister Location experiment.",2016-10-15 16:33:56+00:00,d8t78f4,1,t3_57loik,17884,fivenightsatfreddys
1,First and last try. I'm not doing all that work again. But glad with the results.,2015-10-31 12:08:47+00:00,cwjddlr,1,t3_3qyhbj,49,Undertale
2,"Alphys says that because from her viewpoint, monsters need a human soul to cross the barrier. But actually, a human alone CAN cross the barrier, since Chara, and all the seven humans fell in the underground (and crossed the barrier as consequence).
The human soul actually protects a monsters while crossing the barrier. Monsters just ""fall down"" from their attempt to cross the barrier by using their own soul alone (and become the experiment objects for Alphys' experiments).

3,"Thanks everyone for replying. Yeah, I can live with the idea that Chara possesses Frisk just because he fell on his grave.",2015-10-23 15:13:35+00:00,cwa3tmu,1,t3_3psrwb,77478,Undertale
4,"Chara got to know that the buttercup was poisonous when he and Asriel accidentally poisoned Asgore cooking him a pie.

Maybe it was just an accident or maybe it was actually intended from Chara to test the poison. One way or another, Chara just laughs off when the poison takes effect, since he's an evil a******.

We must supose too that Chara somehow finds out that a Monster with 7 human souls can be an almighty God. Maybe during his stay in the underworld or maybe before that.

If he knew that information from before, that means that maybe falling down to the underworld was not an accident but rather an alibi. Let's remember that Chara is described as someone ""that hated humanity"". So, if he had an megalomaniac plan (Megalovania, duh) like conquering the world of destroying humanity, etc, he wanted to fall into the underworld and convince a monster to absorb his soul and other six human souls so that he may become God.

He convinced Asriel that if he died and Asriel absorbed his soul, they could pass through the barrier and after absorbing other six human souls they could break the barrier forever and set all the monsters free to come back to the surface. However he never intended to do that. He just wanted to absorb the human souls to become God and continue with his plan. He couldn't care less about breaking the barrier or not.

So, that's why in the tape Asriel says ""Psst"". His parents couldn't know Chara's state was not caused by a random sickness but because of the poison he voluntarily took.

With the excuse of him wanting to see the flowers of his village, he justified Asriel taking him out to the surface (so they could gather the remaining human souls).

Asriel hesitated but in the the end he sticked to the plan: Chara died, Asriel absorbed his soul and could pass through the barrier.
In the surface Asriel goes to Chara's village with his corpse.

*The purpose of bringing the corpse along once you already have the human soul may be because Chara wanted Asriel to use his body as a vessel when they become God.

Once there we know that there were two polarized intentions. One side of the Asriel wanted to slaughter the villagers (because of all the attacks) and the other didn't. The murderous side was actually Chara's will. So they could absorb the human souls.

In the end, for some reason, Asriel ""smiles"" and flies away back to the underworld to die from all the injuries he had received.

So, I have always wondered the importance of stating that he smiled before fleeing. I think that at the crucial moment when they had to murder people, Asriel suddenly realized that he was being used by his so called ""friend"" all the way along. He knew Chara was evil, but until then he didn't want to accept that. Even when his friend laughed off when his father got sick because of them.

So he just returns back to the underground prefering to die and screw Chara's evil plan than to kill the villagers and become an evil god.

*He might've also realized that Chara planned to take over Asriel will once they became god.

That's just a theory but every piece of the puzzle seems to fit pretty well like this.",2015-10-17 17:59:06+00:00,cw34fr9,1,t3_3ommr0,338465,Undertale
