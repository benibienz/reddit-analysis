And also the fact that Frisk's body is all yellow and his eyes are closed...
I started to think that:
1- Eyes closed mean you're being possessed by some entity.
2- The yellow colored skin means your body've been kept from rotting thanks to some kind of magic and/or the mummy wrappings.
That being said, my hypothesis is that you're using the actual Chara's dead body. His soul could've been brought back to his dead body once Asriel dies in the flower garden. But since he's already dead, he can't do anything until revived. But his soul never disappears because of all his determination.

So, who's controlling his dead body?
Maybe you, the player, are Frisk. You see, when you give your soul to Chara after a genocide run and resetting the world, and then you finish a Pacifist Run, in the end you see Chara opening his eyes, meaning that he has total control of the body.
Since he can now control the body thanks to you, what part do Frisk have in all this? It looks like he has no will to change anything, it's all on you.

Now we can supose that you're actually Frisk. You're this entity that possessed the dead body. It's not your actual body so the eyes never open because the real owner of the body is not in action. The body is being controlled.

Another thing that really bugs me is the name of Chara's counterpart: Frisk.
Looking in the dictionary, one of 'frisk's connotations is: ""To move about briskly and playfully; frolic."" You know what it reminds me? A puppet. A puppet moved thanks to your hands. Remember the boat lady's advice?: ""Beware of the one that speaks in hands."" She's not talking about the grey sprite with a piece of Gaster in his hand. She's talking about you, the one that interacts with the game, through your hands, tapping on the keyboard. The one with enough power to erase everythin and reset the world.

All this would explain a lot of what happened to Chara's body. Where could it have been buried? The bed of flowers looks like the perfect place to bury someone you really care about. Toriel loved Chara even though she never knew he was a psycopath.

Now some things that spoils the truthful of this theory:
1- Before you True Reset Flowey appears to ask you not to erase everyone's memories. To let ""Frisk live their life"". So maybe in the end Frisk is really someone else.
    Since
2- If you were controlling Chara's body, people would've recognized you. Toriel most of them all.
    I have a saying on this last one. See, you're IDENTICAL to Chara. The only difference is the shirt you're wearing, and little more. Maybe the skin color change and the closed eyes are enough to monsters think of you as a different person.
Maybe you have different clothes because your previous clothes would be all covered in blood due to the attacks on Asriel in the village, so, to give you a decent burial, Toriel cleaned your body and put new clothes on you that she herself had made.
Maybe monsters don't recognize you from your pyshics but from your essence.

What do you guys think?
