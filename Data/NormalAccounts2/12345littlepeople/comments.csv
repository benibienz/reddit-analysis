0,"I feel like us, as CTM community need to make fairer and easier maps and get away from the stigma that ""You need to play the hardest maps on Hardcore to be a real CTM map player"" (exaggeration, I know). I feel like we need to do the same thing the Dark Souls series did. 

If you want an easier map I personally recommend either:

-Sunburn Islands by Vechs (However some of the final areas are a little unfair and you'd have to play in an old version of MC)


-Minimalist by Kaladun (I did a lets play on it, and the curve is nice, except for a few levels that were out of place. The end was not too difficult)

Beyond that, I would like to work on an easy CTM map. Something that my 8-year-old sister could play and not get frustrated). Not to plug myself too hard, but I will be live streaming me building it on my Twitch.tv channel (https://www.twitch.tv/12345littlepeople). I hope to start doing that soon. The map would be for 1.9.",2016-06-02 02:26:17+00:00,d3slmnw,2,t1_d3r6va2,89272,CTM

You are an amazing person, DON'T FORGET IT, for wanting to help and talk to your friend. And I wish you were my friend.",2016-03-24 04:41:21+00:00,d1bfcl4,1,t3_4bpfdi,14096,depression

15,"The thing is, the more people you have the more monsters you can kill in a shorter period of time. The more spawners you can destroy, the more area you can light up. This is a key part in a balanced CTM map so how I see it is that with more people you have more hands, but everyone has less stuff. If you play solo you get all the stuff but have to do it all by yourself.

SO I would recommend any map that is 'medium-hard'

As for personal recommendations although I haven't played them, Legendary (By Vechs) and Pantheon (By many people) seem good for more people.",2015-08-04 20:28:17+00:00,ctrifes,1,t3_3fngbe,92292,CTM
