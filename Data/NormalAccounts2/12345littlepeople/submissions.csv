Should I buy a copy of Windows 10 ($100) and Bootcamp it.
OR
Should I save up my money and buy a $300 gaming PC?

I also do video editing and use Final Cut Pro X (So the operating system is a big deal for me, but I would live with copying files).

Here is the specs for all my stuff: https://www.youtube.com/user/12345littlepeople/about

FPS averages:

Tomb Raider 1080p Medium ~50-60 fps (Built-In Benchmark)
Bioshock Infinate 1440p Very High ~50-80 fps (Smooth as hell)
Metro 2033 Redux/Last Light Redux 1080p ANY QUALITY ~10-30 fps (I can't make it run any better)
Minecraft 1440p MAXED SETTINGS ~80 fps
Portal 1/2 1440p Pretty High Details settings (Not fully turned up) 60+ fps with dips to 40 fps
Batman Arkham City 1080p Medium-High Settings 30-60 fps
