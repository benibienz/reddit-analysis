Me and friend 2 were talking about how friend 1's voicemail on his cell has not changed since 8th grade, so about 5 years at the time of this conversation, and that he sounded like a little kid in it. Friend 1's girlfriend said she never heard it and 1 stated that it is still the same, so we decided to call it up so she can hear it. Friend 1's phone was sitting on the table in front of us at this time, and I pull out my cell and call him by selecting him from my contacts, so there was no possibility of a wrong number. I then put my phone on speaker and friend 1's phone starts to ring, so of course he was going to let it go to voicemail, but someone answered. His phone stopped ringing as the other person picked up, a voice not a single one of us recognized, and started talking on the other end of the line, while friend 1's phone was clearly not picked up on the table in front of us.

714,"I think first it would cause some turmoil in the major religions. I am talking major turmoil, like the what do we now classify as a god turmoil. Surely based on power alone a being such as Superman can be considered a god, or rather godlike figure. Eventually it would flatten out, the general consensus being one of two things.

A. Jesus was super powered, like those that now walk the earth, however it is all through chance, biology, and evolution meaning he is a mere scientific anomaly.

B. Jesus was super powered, like those that now walk the earth, however it is through the grace of god that he had these powers cast upon him. Therefore these new supers must be touched by the grace of god in order to have powers such as Jesus did. 

Now I know that Jesus didn't shoot lasers but stories go that he did some pretty miraculous things that could be considered superpowers. Or that he did things that a witness back in the time of Jesus could only interpret as miracles from heaven. Really it would all come down to the debate regarding god and superpowers. 

Are they powerful because of god?

It was my second time seeing Rush, who is probably my favorite band, but two main things came together to make it the best concert. First the whole thing was a retrospective where they started with their newest stuff and played songs from almost all of their albums as they worked their way back to their first album. So as someone who is too young to have seen most of their previous tours it was amazing to see these three 60 year old men rock the fuck out of the arena, especially with their older material. The other main reason it was the best is I received a snare drum head signed by all three members of the band, so that's pretty badass.

Iron guards to protect the arms and legs from bites and scratches. Now the next largest target target will be the chest and back, but it will only be vulnerable to claws so a sufficiently thick leather chest piece should do. Finally the head which will be at the mercy of the bears claws but also its jaws so we must think smart. While a standard helmet would protect it from punctures, it could still crush so we want to keep the jaws from closing. So the helmet, preferably iron or steel, should have pieces that jut off to the sides as well as a fin up top to keep the bears jaws from being able to close. I would also recommend metal rings on the gorillas hands in place of the brass knuckles, it's grip and fine hand movements evolved for a reason so it should be able to use them.

907,"I awoke with a start and checked my watch, 3:15 AM, ""Fuck what happened"" I say rubbing my head and observing my surroundings. It is a train station ,although seemingly devoid of other passengers or trains for that matter. I don't even remember how I got here, it must have been one hell of a night, judging by my headache it clearly was. ""Hello!"" I call out to the empty station, nothing but my echo answers back. 

I decide to survey my surroundings, maybe I can find a map or a sign or hell an exit door. It was not too long into my search that I finally come across another person, a man dressed in what appeared to be an outfit fitting a turn of the century banker, with a black suit and tie over a pressed and bright white shirt complete with black top hat. Behind him sat a train, a rather old looking steam locomotive black as pitch. It must be some sort of travelling museum exhibit, I think to myself and approach the man.

""Excuse me sir, I was wondering if you could tell me where I am, what station is this?""

""You mean you don't know? But you arrived here did you not?"" replied the man

""Well yes but you see the last thing I remember was leaving a bar and then I woke up here. I assume I wandered here but cant quite remember how""

The man looked at me for a moment and then checked his stop watch before replying ""Well you are here now and this is the last train for the night, I suggest you consider boarding I cannot wait much longer.""

""What do you mean?"" I ask confused

A little exasperated the man replies"" This train you see? I am the conductor and well we are very close to being behind schedule so I suggest you consider boarding or else you will be waiting for the next train and I can not guarantee how long it will be. The engine is fired and the clock is ticking."" 

""I am trying to get home I do not need a train I need a cab."" 

""Well you will find no cab service here but I can assure you this train will get you home, Now come one my watch never stops and I have appointments to keep I cannot hold them all up for you."" The man says rather annoyed now

""Well,  I just don't see how an old train on an unknown route from an unknown station will get me home. I suppose I will wait here until morning and let you be on your way"" Perhaps my stubbornness had gotten the best of me I truly was lost in an unknown part or and unknown location but ultimately decided my best bet would be to wait and hope the station got busy in the morning.

""Suit yourself then Mr. Bennet."" The man replied with an annoyed sight as he motioned to the engineer and stepped inside the train. 

As the engine roared to life and the train shuttered into motion, I stood confused wondering how the man could have known my name. Perhaps he had looked through my pockets when I was out, maybe he tried to rob me, I thought to myself as I checked my pockets. Pulling out my wallet I noticed everything seemed to be in present and in order, but a little more damp then I thought it would be. 

Putting my wallet back in my pocket I sat down on a bench staring at the now empty platform going over the events of that very strange encounter. It must be residual drunkenness from the night, it was the only way this event makes any sense. Or perhaps this is a dream, I though to myself, yeah that's it a dream I stumbled my way into a train station and any minute now a police officer will be waking me up to tell me to go home.

With this revelation I decided to lay down on the nearest bench and wait for the inevitable moment of my waking. While laying I must have drifted off to sleep. My brain waking before my eyes open, I saw the flash of lights through my eyelids, and heard a pair of voices. I woke up in the same train station only now everything was wet and run down, a far cry from the way it was last time I awoke here. Only now I realized that the platform was open to the outside, and I saw a police officer walking out of his car, I yelled to him but he didn't seem to hear me.

""What do you make of this one."" Sgt. Harrison asked to the two nearby paramedics

""They were long gone by the time we showed up, looks like they tried to walk across the railroad bridge"" One of the paramedics replied.

""This happens all the time, most likely a drunk trying to stumble home and decided to take a shortcut."" The other paramedic added.

Me, being the curious type had to know what poor son of a bitch they found in the river. I yelled to them, but they didn't seem to hear me, the sound of the river must have been louder than I thought. I made my way over to them but by the time I did they were loading a body into the ambulance and departing the scene.

IT was the damnedest thing I cant believe they didn't notice me, I guess maybe they were caught up in the zone and didn't have time for a random drunk. It was at that moment I stepped on something that felt odd. I knelt down to see what it was and saw what appeared to be a wallet halfway buried in the mud. The funny thing is, it looked a lot like mine. 

Well, I guess I better wait for the next train, hopefully it comes soon.

It was after practice so I was in basket ball shorts and she was in these tight short shorts, well there was no more room so she sat on my lap because she thought it would be funny. Well the ride got a bit bumpy and me being a horn teenager my body decided it would be a good time to go diamond hard. She definitely noticed because she stopped talking for a second and then wiggled her hips a little bit and slid back into me.

Now I could sit here and bore you with stories of some massive fish I caught, but I've never been that great of a fisherman not that I'm bad just so far nothing to write home about ya know? Or I could sit here and tell you stories about some crazy shit I did high school growing up in a small feeling farm town, but I'll just sound like I'm straight out of a country song. And besides all of that is stuff everybody had heard before from someone, but I bet I got something that few to no people can say happened to them.

So let's set the scene here, it's early spring 2011 and getting towards the end of my first year of college. Me and a couple buddies were at a gas station getting ready to make a cruise to San Francisco, my car at the time was a 37 year old American Classic, well I still have the car only now she's 42. Anyways so I'm gassing her up because she has a big thirsty V8 right under her red hood, when this homeless man walks up to me, and asks for some spare change. Well unfortunately I was a broke college student putting gas in a car with a 37 year old V8 engine so naturally I had no money to give him. So I explained that I had no money to give him and he thanked me for giving him the time of day and began to walk off, so I turned around to talk to my friend who was sitting in the back seat. It was at this time when I heard the man yell ""Hey buddy!"" And I turned around as he tossed me a small object, which I didn't catch and it bounced off my open door. When I picked it up I saw that it was a Green Lantern ring, like a legit one with a metal band, and I looked up and the dude was gone. I often wonder many things about that day such as why did he have it? And why did he give it to me? But alas those questions may never be answers but hey free ring.",2016-09-30 03:27:29+00:00,d87v5bo,1.0,t3_555rxx,4680.0,KindVoice

1441,"Well I'm honestly not sure if this counts because I don't know if the house was haunted or it was just a couple really strange isolated incidents. 


So back when I was really young, 5 or 6, I had an Uncle that I really enjoyed spending time with and playing with his model trains. Well one day he died, but before he did he gave me this brass train that you wind up and it goes around the track playing music. For about a week after he died my parents and my sisters would hear the train playing it's music and hear me making noise in my room for a little while after my bedtime. One day when I was asked what I was doing I responded that ""I was playing with Uncle Mike"". Shortly after I was asked about it, I stopped and never did that again but I still kept the train on dresser for quite some time, and from time to time it would start going around and playing music by itself. Which one could chalk up to the spring holding tension, if anyone her wound it up which they didn't. For a while I kept it out but as when we moved older I never took it out of my box of stuff and now it stays in the garage. Honestly I'm a little afraid that it is haunted which is why I keep it out there. And I'm not positive that it's not just my mind playing tricks, but every now and then when I am in my garage I hear the music coming from its box. 

I had a few other strange experiences in that house as well, unrelated to those but I don't know if they necessarily woudl count as hauntings.",2016-08-06 16:10:38+00:00,d66rt6h,1.0,t3_4wg1bo,6707.0,Thetruthishere

Well we started fighting a bit senior year of highschool, he had always been the one that got made fun of the most in our group but it really started to bother him senior year because he felt that it was truly an attack on him. This all eventually culminated at the end of the school year in a certain event where the three of us did something to him that he did not like and jt made for a very strange summer. Three of us had hung out a bit with out him and he felt left out but also because of the previous situation didn't always want to do things with us and he kept up his act of trying to act superior to us before we all went to separate colleges that coming fall, back in 2011. We hung out once after we started school and he spent most of the time talking about his friends at college and was somewhat distant and that was the last time we even talked, the other three of us still maintain contact though.

But it had a 350 cubic inch V8 and I loved it from the moment I saw it. I put a fair amount of work into it, getting a stereo system installed, rebuilding the top half of the engine, threw on some flow masters, had it painted a shining Candy Apple Red with white racing stripes because i was 17 when I decided on the paint job, put in a power steering pump, however I never added a brake booster or an AC compressor  because A. I'm not a coward and B. AC compressors are just extra weight.

He then very loudly undoes the velcro on his ballistics vest, later on I learned there is no way to do it quietly, and unclips his holster and sets it on the table in front of him and sits down and starts eating while staring at me. He was never rude or threatening to me or anything after that, like he never gave me a what sre your inrentions talk or anything, and he holds to the story that he didn't see me that night he was just tired, but I know what his end game was.

2148,"I was bullied a bit when I was in 6th grade, bevause i was a typical dorky 6th grade boy so I was chubby, had a speech impediment, and liked things that werent cool to like at the time, nothing too scarring and it never got physical. Well almost never it stopped when I pushed one of the regular bullies over a bench, he didn't get hurt but it shut him up. From 6th grade through sophomore year of highschool I also was a bit of a bully to another kid but never saw him after freshman year to see how he turned out, I do feel bad about it.

In 8th grade I started bullying one kid in particular, I actually was in Webelos with him before this, and j still feel really bad about it but when I saw him again a few years later he didn't harbor any ill feelings over it. 

When I was a freshman and sophomore I was still a bit on the chubby side and had really sloppy handwriting(hell I still do) so I got picked on about that a bit but only by two people in particular. The second half of my sophomore year is whrn I started driving and my car at the time(that I still have) was a 1974 Nova with a 350, which oddly enough became a way for the guy who somewhat verbally bullied me earlier in HS to pick at me. But I mean his best way to try to insult me was ""you get what like 10 miles to the gallon"" so he really lost his potency really quick, also he drove a Chevy Astro Van. 

When I started junior year I had officially left my awkward stage in life, my car was a shiny candy apple red, and I thought I was just the biggest badass around. So of course like most hot headed highschool boys I became loud, and rowdy, and insincere, and rude and pretty much just a douche bag to  a lot of people. It didn't hurt with the lady's but I was really harsh to a good amount of people either directly too them or just by ignoring them and occasionally shooting them down when they were near. Always through comments about my car and what not just as a way to try to make myself look better than them which I see as a way of bullying. Also I feel like I should mention I was in marching band so I mean I was bullying my own kind. I'm now on pretty good terms with one kid I was exceptionally hard on but I burnt a lot of bridges, broke a few hearts and lost a good friend so it's safe to say that I feel bad for being, what I would call just not in the usual sense, a bully.",2016-04-10 07:01:19+00:00,d1x2782,1.0,t3_4e4vg0,2260.0,AskReddit

Also be sure to check out the USS Pampanito in SF and the USS Hornet a short drive away in Alameda. Now personally I would theb shoot down the great Highway one and enjoy the scenic views of the beautiful California coast on my way to the somewhat quaint town of Monterey home to the historic Cannery Row, loads of inspiration for John Steinbeck, the rocky beaches of Pacific Grove, the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Laguna Seca Race Way it is also 40 minutes away from Pinnacles National Park home to Pinnacles Peak. And maybe this shoudl have gone at the top but on your way into California, or at least before you leave, make sure you visit Yosemite National Park and experience the beautiful wilderness of Northern California.

And celebrate the great classic George Lucas film American Graffiti with a week long celebration of polished chrome, candy coated customs and good old fashion classic American Hot rods, street rods, muscle cars and cruisers, me and my Nova will be there. A short drive from Modesto is the small town of Oakdale the self proclaimed ""Cowboy Capitol of the World"".

The Uber/taxi eventuality, at least for cities, is foreseeable but I do not entirely agree with most people using them. However then we would have to share, and here in America we have a lot of cars. People in cities I can see going for the taxi plan, as I have a friend who grew up in SF who has no desire to ever own a car which makes sense, but what about places like where I grew up where public transit is not that great?

I think in the long run, sure they will go fast but the cars will be designed in a way so you don't really know they are going fast. They wont be designed to feel fast or fun, they will be designed to feel comfortable. In a world of full autonomy why would top speed or 0-60 times matter, or even handling, if there is no driver input then its jut on ""rails"".

Granted this may not always be the case, but I would put money on it being true 8 out of 10 times. It's not even always an issue over price, at least in the case of Porsche you can get a Cayman for less than a Cayenne, but it isn't as useful as a daily driver. So the person who wants to say they drive a Porsche goes out and buys a gussied up VW Tourage. And the story is Somewhat the same for BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, and Audi. So people who want a premium badge go out and get a premium badged SUV, so they can honestly say they drive a (insert company here) and appear better than the person with the non premium badged car.

3468,"Alright I am a bit late to the party but would still like to throw in my two cents. I'm assuming since you said first car you are probably somewhere between 15 and 17, as I was around that age when I got my first car(15 to be exact) way back in the good old days of 2008. It was, well still is since I still own it, a 1974 Chevrolet Nova sedan with a 350 V8 under the hood, I bought it in a somewhat sorry state and built it up, am still building it up actually. That was the only car I owned until 2013. It got me to school abd back everyday just fine and for a year when I lived in Monterey it got me to and from the central valley once or twice a month without incident. What's the weather like where you live? Personally living in central California I don't have to deal with snow but it freezes jn the winter and if the inside is a work in progress you will as well, and in the summer it gets scorching so unless it has A/C, which is just extra weight, you will melt in the summer much like I did. Classic cars are not the most reliable but if you diligently take care of them they will suit you just fine, so you don't really need a backup car. Owning a classic car as your first and only car will definitely be an experience that I would say is worth having, even for the inevitable times where it may be just a bit miserable. That car will always pull you through those times and when you find yourself on an empty straight stretch of road those miserable times will no longer seem important. So if you want a classic as your first car I highly recommend it, don't waste time or money with a backup car at first it will be a valuable learning experience for you, and many many memories will be made with that car.",2016-01-01 19:11:51+00:00,cyihrr5,1.0,t3_3xxxaw,816169.0,classiccars

Like Van Halen was getting progressively better up through 1984, at least a bit they did swing a little more poppy than Van Halen, which can be easily argued that it is a much better album than 1984, but on whole there was some form of improvement album to album peaking with 1984. And then of course Roth left after 1984 and Van Hagar released 5150 which was good, not Van Halen(the album) good,and a bit poppier to continue with the trend the band was already on but a good effort by Sammy. Things kind of go down hill from there, at least in my opinion, reaching the lowest point of course with Van Halen III.

3658,"If you buy domestic go for a Chevrolet...ok that may be a little biased on my part but they hae never steered me wrong before.
If you want something a little more rugged you can not do better than  a Jeep Wrangler, however be prepared because they are not the most reliable of cars but goddamned are they fun. If you want something a little more practical but still fun, I really enjoy my Mazda3, well I enjoy it as much as one can enjoy something with a 4 cylinder engine.

3672,"Yeah I'm doing my best to avoid a dull and lifeless car, which is why I am doing the driving because my friends options are either a Corolla or a not XJ Cherokee. Originally the plan was to use my Wrangler YJ but I had to get rid of it in May of this year. And since I am just barely too young to rent a car the choice comes between my 1974 Nova or my 08 Mazda3. However it is slanted in favor of the Mazda3 because even though it is 4 cylinders lighter, 3.7 liters smaller and fwd it handles much better around curvy roads. 

Thanks for the input I will definitely take all of that into account for planning.",2015-11-15 19:09:02+00:00,cx15quw,2.0,t1_cx0ct7y,71694.0,roadtrip
