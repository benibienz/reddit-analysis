Mainly because I think it is easier to get a true opinion on the album, from myself, if I compare it to albums that are more similar to it, for example I try not to compare Fly by Night and Hold Your Fire as they are two radically different albums. 

The way I divide it up is Rush(all by itself because it has its own sound) then the Epic Era which spans Fly by Night all the way through Hemispheres, from there I start the Transformative period which includes Permanent Waves through Grace Under Pressure, then of course the 80s really sets in with Power Windows up through Presto which logically drops into the Tonally Dark period of Roll the Bones through Test for Echo and then concludes with what I call the Renaissance period of Vapor Trails through Clockwork Angels.

Back to the main point, I was wondering what would be some good watches or brands to get more into collecting and where is the best place to find older vintage watches should I limit myself to antique stores or check garage/estate sales as well and hope I get lucky? Any other information to help me get more into the hobby would be appreciated as well thanks.",Watches,[Advice] Advice for a watch novice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/3wpvms/advice_advice_for_a_watch_novice/
