193. O Captain! My Captain! 


1

O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;	 
The ship has weather‚Äôd every rack, the prize we sought is won;	 
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,	 
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:	 
    But O heart! heart! heart!	         5
      O the bleeding drops of red,	 
        Where on the deck my Captain lies,	 
          Fallen cold and dead.

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;	 
Rise up‚Äîfor you the flag is flung‚Äîfor you the bugle trills;	  10
For you bouquets and ribbon‚Äôd wreaths‚Äîfor you the shores a-crowding;	 
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;	 
    Here Captain! dear father!	 
      This arm beneath your head;	 
        It is some dream that on the deck,	  15
          You‚Äôve fallen cold and dead.	 
  
3

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;	 
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;	 
The ship is anchor‚Äôd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;	 
From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;	  20
    Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!	 
      But I, with mournful tread,	 
        Walk the deck my Captain lies,

Regardless of my view of that, people are strongly opposed to it, so boycotting the practice of if business.

The only explanation i can think of so far reading through is that lobbyists and other interest groups (including large groups comprised of citizens, not elites) succeed more often simply because it draws attention to an issue. It may not explain all of the skew in data, but I'm sure it is a good percentage.

Something for you to think about, https://imgur.com/a/8eD9V this is from the thesis I personally did. It compared the voting behavior of members in the house to political ideology of their districts. Substitution for the voting habits in the obama Romney elections, which I argued was an election that closely resembled political ideology. 

In the graph, you can make the conclusion that representatives are voting in close relation to the ideological climate of their districts.

Its set up like that for a reason, because of this idea that white people are the root cause of injustice in the world. 

Secondly is pigeon holes individuals in the PoC group. The moment they step away from the narrative of the ""subjected class"" they become ""self hating."" And receive the backlash from their group. Becoming an ""Oreo"" ""apple"" ""Twinkie"" color on outside, white on inside.

254,"your agent is going to put you on a search for properties, that can be narrowed down by a number of things. Certain things however wont be able to be searched, you'll just have to look at the listing and hope. You also have to realize that you and your agents are looking at listings put together by other agents who may not go into amazing detail on their listings. So I try to keep my clients on a less restrictive search so they don't miss out on some ""maybe"" listings!

Depending on the area that you live (I'm in Illinois, so it may be different for you!) great things to narrow down with are: Price range, bed/bath, basement, garage spaces, acreage. depending on how unique your preferences are for the are, it may narrow it down a whole lot! Then you can just search the listings for other things you're looking for.

Too specific things would probably be fenced in yard, new X (roof, utilities, etc.), and just other smaller things.

Is Bernie a better person? maybe? I think Trump is a good person too. What they both have in common is that they're fighting against party politics, that's why they both got so much traction. Trump is not corrupt, Trump is not racist, or homophobic, or whatever other derogatory term you want to come up with to not have to listen to what he has to say. He doesn't always say the right thing, but he's not a politician. 
I wholly disagree with Bernies vision of the future. We need a little trump in America. 

The fighting that has been happening these past few months are things that should have been talked about over the last few decades! but because everyone was so scared to say anything (without being politically correct), we couldn't say things that are maybe true, but hard to hear. Now we've gotten to a point that if anyone wants to have an opinion that isn't strickly SJW they're automatically a bigot.

If you (as an insurance company) take money and promise a certain level of coverage, you should be required to back that promise. there are more issues obviously on both sides from hospitals to patients, but a lot of issues don't have clear answers.

World at War was fantastic, MW2 introduced multiple different killstreaks while still being balanced (and some other notible changes that were fun!)

Just so many good things happened from cod4-BlackOps 1. 

Then it had to be more future. And more advanced. And more super human. It lost the feel that it always had. Knowing when you bought the new COD you were in for a great ride.
