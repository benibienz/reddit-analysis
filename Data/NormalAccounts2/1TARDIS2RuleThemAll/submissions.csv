For example Halo, Call of duty, Gear of war. Stuff like that. 
Now, as much as i totally understand us wanted to play certain games that we loved individually, the point is to play together. Secondly the more people we draw into the sub, the more we can have different games from different platforms going at the same time! 
So my idea is to start this OGW with Halo 3. I think that would get the biggest draw from the gaming community, and will be better for the sub and for all of us in the future! 
So if you're interested, message me your Gammertag and i'll put together a spreadsheet of the people that will be playing. Secondly invite everyone and anyone, spread it on the different subs and lets really try to get this thing big. 
It will take a while to spread it, but I assure you that we will all be happier in the future if we put in the work now!!
