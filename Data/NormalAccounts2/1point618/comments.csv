5,"_Cloud Atlas_ by David Mitchell definitely fits the bill. I don't want to spoil it, but it's told as 6 short stories that all connect, and range in genre from historical fiction to modern technothriller to SF/cyberpunk. The way he switches between stories is really cool too. His novel _The Bone Clocks_ is also told through short stories, although they're all in sequence, and _Ghostwritten_ is told in short stories, where the main character of each new story was a secondary character in the last one, until they all come together in the final story. It's all cool stuff, and he writes really read character-driven SF. And to be clear, they're not fix-up novels like _The Martian Chronicles_, all the stories are written with the larger novel in mind and end up being a lot more than the sum of their parts.

_Infinite Jest_ by David Foster Wallace is of course one of the better examples of postmodern/experimental fiction, and is pretty SFnal. 

_Excession_ by Iain M. Banks includes long chapters told as dialog between artificial intelligences communicating across wide ranges of space, which pretty much looks like email list communication. _A Fire Upon the Deep_ by Vernor Vinge has a faster-than-light but low-bandwidth communication system that a few intermission chapters are taken from that looks a lot like an old-school altnet forum. Both are solid space operas, and are otherwise told fairly conventionally.

_Hyperion_ by Dan Simmons includes a frame story of 6 pilgrims on their way to a death-and-wish granting super AI, and each pilgrim tells their life story which takes the form of a short story inside the novel. Its pretty much required that you read the sequel, _Fall of Hyperion_, as they're meant to be one book. _Fall_ also has some narrative trickery, but not to the degree the first does.

_House of Leaves_ by Mark Z. Danielewski does a tonne of weird experimental shit with narrative and even typography, where the story, setting, narrative, and typography all mirror each other at any given point. It's horror, not SF, but close enough.

_Existence_ by David Brin includes some ""normal"" chapters, as well as others told as press releases, stories-within-stories, message board discussions, and more.

28,"Well, what she writes is more commonly classified as SF, but what I love about Maureen F. McHugh's books is that they simply follow people around a somewhat fantastical future as they just try to get by. No one is saving the world, nothing and no one relies on them but themselves.

_China Mountain Zhang_ is set in a future where Chinese-style communism has taken over the US, and follows a ""ABC"" (American-Born Chinese) man as he tries to navigate this world: finding work even though he doesn't have the papers to get a good education, dating girls to hide his sexuality, and slowly making his own way through the world through his late twenties. There are also some chapters following secondary characters, including some set on a burgeoning Mars colony dealing with the everyday realities of community and survival technology they face. 

Then _Mission Child_ (which is out of print but easily available through sites like AbeBooks.com) is about a young woman who lives on a planet that was once colonized by Earth, lost contact and reverted to a tribal way of life, and then was re-colonized. When her tribe is wiped out by another aggressive tribe that has gotten some new technology from the colonizers, she and a few others have to trek halfway across the world to try to integrate themselves into the new refugee camps, cities, and economies that the colonists have brought, while dealing with the loss of their way of life and the way they used to look at the world. It's a very personal story focused on the main character, so it's not being preachy at all, just asking how she as a person deals with these hardships. It's a very clear analogy to the Native Americans in the American West during the 19th century, and if you have been following what's going on at Standing Rock at all it might be of added interest, but even if you don't give a single shit about Native American issues, it's a wonderfully sad, personal, and fantastical book.

31,"&gt; Yes, but they have to actually try to make a case, not sit back and assume POC will save them indefinitely.

Fuck this noise. 

Democrats don't ""sit back waiting for people of color"" to ""save"" them. They write and try to pass legislation that helps women and people of color stay on the same footing and have the same opportunities that white men have. 

As long as the non-college-educated white male demographic feels entitled to be above women and people of color in a created social hierarchy, the democrats absolutely should not pander to their desire for entitlements and handouts while denying women and people of color the same.

38,"I think this is overstating the case by a mile. 

Classics can have a lot of problems and still be classics. If someone wrote _Don Quixote_ today, it would not be a good book. What makes it great is not just the content, but the historical context of being the first novel, including metafictional elements, and telling a rather unique story with deep universal themes. However, it's also structured oddly, the writing is stilted, and was written in different chunks at different times with different themes. 

Same goes for _Moby Dick_ and the whaling chapters. Same goes for Isaac Asimov and his complete lack of character development. Or Ray Bradbury and his wrong conception of the Martian environment and biology.

None of these are offensive, but to a new reading coming in without the historical context (and even with it) they can lead to not really enjoying the works as works, so much as as artifacts. 

Meanwhile, Dan Brown novels offended millions of people. Seriously, _The DaVinci Code_ is about finding that Jesus was married and discovering his modern descendants, and was released at the height of the Bush years' evangelicalism in the US. There were calls to ban the book. 

I really do think saying ""if someone didn't like what I did it must be because they were offended"" is a terrible method of discourse. This is a discussion forum, and it immediately turns discussion sour as people have to defend whether or not they were offended, when often the truth is simply that what draws them to literature is different from what draws you. That's ok, the worth of literature is 100% subjective. So please try to assume the best of other people's intentions and try to understand them rather than dismissing them as offended and thus not worth engaging with.

40,"Clinton is NOT getting indicted before the election. Full. Stop. If your polisci prof is telling you something different, then he's not doing his job very well. 

Kaine probably isn't anyone's first choice for president. However, he's a dedicated and very skilled public servant who has presided over years of prosperity for Virginia. He cares about social justice, income inequality, and climate change. He would be infinitely better than a full on ethnonationalist who wants to roll back progress that minorities and women have made over the last 70 years. He wants a national policing policy based on racial profiling. He wants to remove a woman's autonomy over her own body. It is not overblown to call Trump's campaign one based on making America an authoritarian state. 

The ""charges"" against Clinton are that other people accidentally sent her classified information to her private server. What no one seems to be saying clearly is that would be a problem even without the private server part: DoS email systems are not set up to send classified information over them, there are other secured networks for that. The only reason that Clinton is a part of the investigation is that this mishandled classified information went through a sever that she owned, so technically she is implicated in ""handling"" it as well. 

Setting up a server was, in hindsight, a mistake. It was also an understandable one: government IT services are terrible, as evidenced by the fact that the DoS email service was hacked by foreign states multiple times, while Clinton's server stayed secure. 

So there's your choice: a full on white nationalist who wants to create a police state, or a left of center woman who happened to make a bad technology decision.

First, Alaska itself is bigger than the entirety of pre-Crimean-annex Ukraine. Second, unlike Crimea, the only Russian speakers in Alaska are those who fled Russia due to religious persecution and have no desire to go back. They also make up a tiny minoritu of he state's population. Finally, Alaska is on a different continent from Russia. The distance from the Easternmost Russian city to the west most Alaskan city is over 2700 miles of taiga, tundra, and ocean. It's almost 5000 miles from Moscow to Alaska (that's twice the width of the continental US). Meanwhile, from Moscow to Crimea is just about 800 miles driving—the same distance as driving from NYC to Savannah.

77,"NK Jemisin's _The Fifth Season_ just won the Hugo award, and deservedly so. Great dying earth / apocalyptic high fantasy. Wonderful novel too, Jemisin's writing has come a long ways and the plot and characters really shine. The second book in the trilogy just came out, and it's a worthy sequel. 

The Jack Vance Dying Earth novels stories and novels are of course the original and gold standard of this type of setting. They're really fun, and worth checking out. _Tales from the Dying Earth_ is sort of the ""first"", a collection of stories, some inter-related, others not. If you like those, continue with the rest of them. These are more science fantasy in the vein of Numenera.

Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun tetralogy took the Dying Earth pulp conceit and made it into high literature. The books are relentlessly difficult to read—the language is archaic, nothing is explained, there are multiple unreliable narrators, and many stories within stories. Honestly I enjoyed having read them more than I did reading them, but they were definitely worth the slog (and I say this as someone who loves difficult postmodern literature). 

M. John Harrison's _Virconium_ and related stories and novels definitely fit the bill as well. I've barely scratched the surface so I can't give a proper review, but Harrison is a great writer.

Going more strictly science fiction, you might like the Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons and the Culture Cycle by Iain M. Banks. Both are space operas set in distant futures where humanity has conquered the galaxy, so there's less of the Earthbound feel that Numenera and the Dying Earth genre novels have, but a lot of the tech-so-advanced-its-magic and beautiful heartbreaking landscapes are found in both. I am particularly partial to the Culture novels, as the settings range from sentient spaceships to large orbital stations to medieval planets that are making first contact with the Culture. The Hyperion and Endymion novels, on the other hand, do the ""long journey through multiple future-fantasy settings with a small party at odds with each other"" thing that the Numenera RPG does really well.

_Lord of Light_ by Roger Zelazy is a fun twist on this type of setting, as it's set on a colony planet that lost contact with the rest of civilization, and so developed its own civilization based on using mind-uploading and genetic engineering technology to make real the Hindu gods and metaphysics. Reincarnation exists in the form of mind uploading, karma is tallied by computers, and the original settlers have made themselves immortal and given themselves godlike powers through gene therapy and admin control of the reincarnation network. The novels follow one of the original settlers as he uses the teachings of the Buddha to stage a revolution against the Hindu caste system. The great thing is that none of the technology is spoken of as such, it's only talked about in its mythological terms.

That should get you started at least. Top recommendations would be Jemisin, Vance, and Banks, in that order.",2016-10-17 15:49:33+00:00,d8vu2ef,1.0,t3_57xt41,2406.0,printSF

[The GOP](https://twitter.com/DeeTwoCents/status/785144663774822400) and [their presidential nominee](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/785120729364922369) are currently at war with each other, which is going to [majorly depress voter turnout for not just Trump](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-bottom-could-fall-out-for-trump/), but also the [Republican Senate and House candidates](https://twitter.com/jwomack/status/785131965209010176). Johnson is only a factor inasmuch as he can leak support from one or the other candidate.

If they really want to have a shot though, they're going to have to start putting up candidates in local elections as well. The American public isn't super happy with 3rd party candidates because our voting system makes is almost impossible for them to win, and if they do well but don't win, then the outcome is usually worse than if they'd just not competed (see Gore losing the election to Bush b/c of Nader—regardless of what you think of those three candidates, most of the Nader voters would have been much happier in a world where Gore had won). So what they really need to do is to start winning races at a local level to build up some amount of political capital. Winning a House seat or two and then caucusing with the Republicans (so as not to throw the House to the Dems) would gain them a lot of traction, is definitely doable esp. after this high-profile election for them where they won't be seen as spoilers in the same was as Nader, and would get them in the national spotlight all the time, instead of just once every 4 years.",2016-10-09 16:49:35+00:00,d8klj04,2.0,t1_d8kkj8t,1486.0,alaska

Given that the last poll was completed after the first debate, but long before the sexual assault bragging tape came out, Murkowski reiterated her non-support, etc., Trump will probably lose some voters in the next poll. 

I could see a situation where Johnson and Trump split the conservative votes and Clinton wins the state. It is pretty unlikely, but right now 538 gives Clinton a better chance of winning Alaska than Trump has of winning the presidency. 

I also think that if Johnson really wanted to win some electoral votes, Utah, New Mexico, Alaska would be the three states to focus on, with Alaska being the best bet but also the one that makes it hardest to get more of the national popular vote. If he barnstormed Alaska I think he'd be in contention to win a three-way race, but then he'd be spending his time and energy roving a largely rural, out of sight state instead of doing more public events in a more populated, connected state in the SW/Mountain region. 

Given that Weld (Johnson's running mate) has explicitly said his goal is to deny Trump the presidency, maybe the best thing to do would be to send Weld to Alaska while Johnson does more public events in the lower 48, although I think Weld's ""conservative grandpa"" aesthetic would play much less nicely to Alaskan voters than Johnson's ""stoner redneck dad"" vibe would.

107,"You could show that in areas where Bernie has had rallies, those areas have been more pro-Hillary than other comparable areas. Or something more subtle, such as areas where Bernie has had rallies have seen a more pro-Hillary second derivative, even if that's just ""less negative"", than other parts of the country at the same time.

And regardless, I really don't see how the argument can be made that Bernie has done all he could for Clinton given that he or his campaign: called Hillary a ""democratic whore"", ""unqualified"", and in the pocket of Wall Street, use the email server in attacks and as a reason to keep campaigning, blamed the violence in Nevada on her campaign, called the DNC rigged, continued to campaign on the outrageous lie that he could still win even after New York and even after Trump won, and attended anti-Clinton rallies and had a prominent Bernie-or-Buster nominate him at the DNC. Bernie ran a campaign to win at all costs, even once it was clear he couldn't win. That's not something you do against people who are also on your side. 

It's really great that he's turned things around since then, but let's not revise history. He ran a dirty campaign, was a sore loser, and took _months_ to come around to supporting Hillary in the way he is now. Clinton got (rightly) bashed for doing those things in 2008, and the fact that Bernie gets such a pass in 2016 really looks like implicit sexism and nothing else from where I'm standing.

117,"This was a good month for me. I only read three books, but they were amazing. 

First was CJ Cherryh's _Foreigner_. Good claustrophobic political interigue novel about a human ambassador to an alien race. He's put in an awkward position by the aliens and has to figure out whether he's being protected or backstabbed by them through what he knows of their distinctly alien psychology. Good writing, good characters, and a very interesting world.

I finally picked up _China Mountain Zhang_ by Maureen F. McHugh and it totally blew me away. I have a longer review I'm going to post to r/printSF, but it's about a future where the US is under communist Chinese rule, and follows one young man working in construction through his late 20s as he tries to move up and get by in this world even though he is gay, which is frowned upon in the US and illegal in China. There are also some sections set on a colonized Mars. It's a very small novel in that it's just about regular people living their regular lives, but a very big one in terms of ideas and impact on this reader. 

I liked that so much that I bought McHugh's second novel, _Mission Child_, and read that next. This is the only the third SF novel I've ever read that deals seriously with colonization, after _The Word for World is Forest_ and _Cloud Atlas_, and the one that does it best. You follow a young woman on a planet that has lost and just regained contact with Earth, as she goes from her hunter-gatherer tribe through various refugee camps and cities, trying to find a place for herself in a world that's rapidly moving from a Neolithic to an SFnal level of tech and society.

NK Jemisin's _The Killing Moon_ and its sequel both deal with issues of civic organization and values, specifically as formerly peaceful places end up going to war.

_Crytal Rain_ by Tobias S. Buckell features a small peaceful hamlet and a city far away which are both under attack from a third, aggressive death-cult civilization. Also, transhuman Aztec ""gods"" are mixed into the bunch. How do all of these different factions deal with their own civic responsibility is one of the big questions posed.

The Bhagavad-Gita is a long treatise on one's civic responsibility and place in life. Now, on the one hand it's medieval religious propaganda for the caste system, but on the other it's a beautiful, fantastical story that can be read as a military/metaphysical scifi novel, sort of _Starship Troopers_ mashed together with _Childhood's End_.

I didn't even go into programming (I find actual programming jobs to be boring as all fuck), I went into tech education. Both the linguistics and CS components help a lot there. But without the CS I wouldn't be able to do what I do with the Tech piece, whereas any writing-heavy social science degree would have done on the Edu side.

That said, while I never use the specifics of what I learned in linguistics, the mechanics of critical thinking, thinking in systems, learning to develop general rules from lots of data, and learning how to write long, readable, persuasive essays about those rules and data are incredibly useful for me on a day-to-day basis.

Then one day I ate in the FoH and realized that even though you couldn't hear anything from the floor on the kitchen, you could hear _everything_ from the kitchen on the floor. Even just normal quiet conversations.

That sort of explained a few disgruntled customers—people we'd quietly shittalked and who had most likely heard us.

It really changed my behavior behind the line and just generally in life, was a good lesson to learn as a 19 year old or whatever.

157,"I noticed the exact same thing.

In particular, a lot of the words use the ""ch"" sound, so you'd expect that they might have a letter just for that sound (since it's not actually a combination of the ""c"" and ""h"" sounds, which are [k] and [h] in IPA, but actually a combination of [t] and the ""sh"" sound, [ʃ].). 

I also noticed that all of the voiced consonants have been removed except for the [z]. That's a little odd, since it appears to be a physiological thing (they can't make voiced sounds with beaks or something like that). I'd also expect the ""r"" to be more like the Spanish ""r"" than the English one ([r] instead of [ɹ]). It's also unclear how they'd be able to make nasal sounds ([n] in particularly) if they have a beak. However, letters for ""sh""/[ʃ] and ""ch""/[tʃ] would be expected. It might be worth adding the glottal stop (done as an apostrophe in most fantasy languages that have it), as well as letters for the clicks in the language, which I imagine they would have many (and which OP mentions). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant) has a lot of the click consonates described w/ audio.

If I can't trust myself to do it without some sort of structure, I wouldn't assume to expect that of others either. I feel like we need something rewarding that encourages people to nominate books that they'll also start discussions on.

Let's put it another way: out of almost 50 responses, only 5% say that they ever start discussion on the books, while 25% say they participate in discussions, and 30% say they would participate more if other people made more posts. The question is how to succeed at the latest while the foremost is true. There's some overlap in these numbers, but something like 40% of respondents do or would post in discussions, but only 5% post the starter discussion. 

Starting a discussion requires a lot more work or mental energy then jumping into a discussion, so we need some way to encourage more of it. We need to get the number of people willing to start discussions closer to 15-20%, and that 3x-4x increase will require some effort and structural changes.

1. Post the book selection thread, remembering to sticky &amp; contest-mode it.

3. Post the book announcement in rSFBC.
4. Post the book announcement in r/printSF and any other relevant subreddits (books, literature, weird or horrorlit sometimes, etc).
5. Update the ""current book"" on the wiki (2 pages) and sidebar.
6. Update automoderator so it knows the book tag that month.
7. Create a post image and sidebar image based on the book's cover, upload them to reddit, add them to the CSS.
8. Monitor discussion for rule-breaking posts (although automod has made this easier as we can now require that posts be tagged correctly). 
9. Try to read the book and make a few posts each month about the book to kickstart discussion.
10. If the author is alive/active, figure out how to reach out to them about hosting an AMA. If they agree, coordinate dates, times, and how-tos with them. This also requires a huge amount of promotion on reddit, as well as a full day of someone's time to monitor the actual AMA thread and make sure that questions posed elsewhere by people who couldn't make it get posted to the thread. An AMA easily triples the already large amount of work for that month.

Based on the feedback so far, having us mods (or someone) responsible for posting discussion on the books is vital if we want to keep rSFBC separate.

254,"I've heard this a lot, but I rather liked _Matter_. A few reasons why:

1. The medieval society living in a constructed world was an interesting setting, one that worked well for the story he was telling.

2. I enjoyed the story of a woman who'd grown up in a backwater world and then become a Culture agent. As someone who grew up in rural Alaska in a cabin without running water, who now lives in NYC and works in technology, it was something I could identify with. It's interesting insomuch as these two cultures (far-past and far-future) can exist in the same universe, and people can move from one to the other. This is actually how our real world works, although on a smaller scale. As Gibson said, the future is here, it's just not evenly distributed. _Matter_ played with that trope on a really large scale.

3. The ultrafast ending makes sense given the situation. Banks is showing that when two societies at different levels of ""future"" contact, the one further in the past is at a massive disadvantage. See also the moment in _Surface Detail_ where the ship plays a battle scene out for one of the humans. ""Wow"" she says, this is all happening now while you're telling me? Shouldn't you be paying attention. And the ship laughs and says ""no, this was all finished before you fully realized I'd gone into battle, I'm just showing off how great I was in a way you'll understand."" Well, with the final battle in _Matter_, you don't get it shown off for you because the main characters don't either. It just happens and is fast and destroys a lot of shit and you won't fully get it. It's almost Lovecraftian in the way it doesn't care for human timescales.

The mommy star has a planet with life that orbits her, but they are not yet space-faring beings. ""Why, mommy?"" they cry as she hurls closer to her lover. ""Why will you destroy yourself and us with you? Are we not your children also?"" ""You are,"" she replies, ""but you have not been able to stray from the nest, and it is also my duty to see my own kind propagate, and thus will you be disintegrated and made again into starstuff as I and my new lover explode.""

And so the two stars do collide, and see the annihilation of all life and geology their gravity wells contain. They combine into one giant star which uses its energy too fast, until it burns out, collapses on itself, and explodes with a force that tears at the very fabric of reality and whose radiation makes inhabitable the planets of stars many light-years away. 

While some of its mass is pulled into the tear in space-time that will continue converting mass and energy into nothingness until the universe ceases to exist, much of the stars' mass is torn into tiny atomic shreds and pushed out into the regions of space around it. A nebula forms, gas and dust cooled from this explosion that drift away from where the stars once were. 

This gas and dust floats around the galaxy, looking for more gas and dust to collect with. If it can find enough, the gravity of all the gas and dust will begin acting to pull it all into a central point. When enough gas and dust has gathered, it will ignite and form a new baby star!

However, the galaxy our mommy and daddy stars were in is one of many galaxies, and the neighboring galaxies are greedy and want more stars of their own. They pass close to our stars' galaxy, each time scooping up a little gas and dust. Eventually, the gas and dust our stars produced is pulled out into the nothing-regions of space between the galaxies, never to find more gas and dust, destined to scatter across the universe as cold, lifeless particles.

LHoD and The Handmaid's Tale are classic works of Feminist SF, a movement which saw its start in the New Wave of the 60s and 70s with authors like Le Guin, Atwood, Butler, Delaney, and Tiptree. All the works that u/HuhDude recommended fit solidly within the Feminist SF subgenre/movement/whatever you want to call it. 

The thing is, that's fine and I'm not really sure why it's worth calling to attention. Feminist SF in particular is better for a teaching environment than most SF because it focuses more on social issues than traditional SF, which is more focused on the plot and maybe some wizbang speculative technology. Almost every single novel recommended in this thread deals with social issues, so it's not surprising to see Feminist SF over-represented in any particular comment.

* _[The Ballad of Black Tom](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0166PX1Z8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1#nav-subnav)_ by Victor LaValle is a Lovecraftian horror story told from the perspective of a black musician living in Harlem in the 20s and a white police officer who get caught up in a plot to awaken Cthulhu. The novella deals with 20s racial politics as well as Lovecraftian horrors. Been recommending this one because its good, short, and $3 for Kindle. 

* _The Obelisk Gate_ by NK Jemisin is her follow-up to this year's Hugo winner, _The Fifth Season_. Great fantasy novels about a world where geology and magic are tightly intertwined, and where civilizations have been rising and falling for tens of thousands of years. Highly recommend them.

* _[Survival](https://www.amazon.com/Survival-Imperative-Julie-E-Czerneda-ebook/dp/B001QREWEQ/)_ by  Julie E. Czerneda. I just started this even though it's been on my to-read list for so long that I don't remember how it got on there. Czerneda is a marine biologist, as is her main character, and the biology in this novel is on-point. In addition, there's a cool galaxy-spanning mystery going on. I'm only about 1/4 of the way through it so just really getting into the full plot, but enjoying it so far.

* _A Door into Ocean_ by Joan Slonczewski. I picked this up b/c we'd read it a few months ago in r/SF_Book_Club, and people seemed to really like it. However, I found it pretty boring and the characters rather shallow, so I quit after about a 100 pages. I doubt I'll go back to this one unless I hear something really compelling about it.

* _Saga vol 1_. Comic book that I've been hearing about for ages. Really good so far, although I'm not that far through it. Looking forward to reading it up to its current run.

* _Black Panther_ by Ta-Nehisi Coates. Another comic run. August saw the completion of the last arc and the beginning of the latest one. The first few issues had some pacing issues, but Coates seems to have found his voice and is barreling ahead with the story of the warrior king whose previously peaceful kingdom sees a popular, feminist uprising. There aren't good guys and bad guys, just shades of grey, which is a nice change from the usual Marvel way.

* _Falling Free_ by Lois McMaster Bujold. I picked this up because of the sheer volumes of praise and recommendation that the Vorksian Saga gets here in r/printSF. However, I'm finding it rather forgettable so far, to the point that I actually forgot that I was half-way through this book and had to edit this comment. The premise is interesting, but it's somewhat clumsily handled and the plot and writing aren't keeping my interest very well. It also suffers _REALLY BADLY_ from the ""20th century morals in a far-future world"" problem that makes a lot of older Space Opera feel really dated.",2016-09-01 13:50:12+00:00,d75d63g,1.0,t3_50mnxk,9274.0,printSF

If you have two ships ""blobbed"" together, then they're protecting each other to a degree.

This makes blobbing lots of ships still really effective, because any ship is only going to be getting hit from one side. 

One way around this might be that shields stack. So if two (or more) ships are close enough to each other, their shields combine into one larger shield. This makes more sense if shields are like energy fields hovering around the ship—as ships stack, the radius increases to fit all the ships.

Anyway, I agree with /u/ElBomberoLoco, get a Mora Companion ($12.99 on Amazon right now) and Hucks Hatchet ($36.66). Or if you don't want the hatchet, get the Companion and the Ontario Rat II ($26.45 [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ontario-Knife-Sp-Black-Handle-Folding/dp/B00BBPAOCW/)), so you have both a good chopping/carving knife (Companion) and a thinner folding knife for detail work, feild dressing, and EDC. Or, if you only want one better knife but also want a fire starter, get the [Mora Bushcraft](https://www.amazon.com/Morakniv-Bushcraft-Sandvik-Stainless-4-3-Inch/dp/B00B90H1T8/) for $34.89 and a [Swedish FireSteel](https://www.amazon.com/Light-Fire-Swedish-FireSteel-Emergency/dp/B004172IG2/) for $10.99. Or the Mora/FireSteel kit is on sale for [$45 right now](https://www.amazon.com/Morakniv-Bushcraft-Stainless-Survival-Sharpener/dp/B00BFIBOJW). 

All those can be had on Amazon w/ free shipping. Sale taxes might apply depending on where you live, but they are all options that are more or less within your price range. Personally, I'd go with the Bushcraft + FireSteel kit (as in, I have gone w/ that and happily own and use it). The Bushcraft is a beefy knife that does everything from chop and split to fine detail work to field dressing in a pinch. The Swedish FireSteel is a really easy firestarting system, a good one to learn on when you're just starting out. The package is nice and the sheath works well. I like the orange on everything b/c if you drop your blade, you can find it again easily on the forest floor. And _definitely_ get the stainless steel when you're starting out, it's much easier to care for for a beginner.",2016-08-29 13:47:40+00:00,d716g59,1.0,t3_4zzbql,88353.0,Bushcraft

313,"Let's see:

* Wikipedia's [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism): _Liberalism is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of liberty and equality. Whereas classical liberalism emphasises the role of liberty, social liberalism stresses the importance of equality. Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but generally they support ideas and programmes such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, free markets, civil rights, democratic societies, secular governments, gender equality and international cooperation._

Check check check to every position there. Civil rights, democratic societies (even when this leads to some of her unfortunate pro-war stances), secular governments, gender equality (""Women's rights are human rights""), and globalism.

* Miriam-Webster lists several [definitions](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liberal) relevant to our political discussion.

* _believing that government should be active in supporting social and political change_

Clearly Clinton believes this, given that she's spent the majority of her adult life working on government solutions to social and political problems from her work on health care as first lady to [any single one of the policy positions](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/) that she espouses now. 

* _broad-minded; especially :  not bound by authoritarianism, orthodoxy, or traditional forms_

I think the woman who didn't want to change her last name and didn't want to ""bake cookies in the white house"" isn't exactly a traditionalist. 

* _of or constituting a political party advocating or associated with the principles of political liberalism_

She's a Democrat, the liberal party in the US, so obviously.

* Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree. Let's see what conservatives think! Conservapedia's [definition](http://www.conservapedia.com/Liberal): _A liberal is someone who craves an increase in government spending, power, and control, such as ObamaCare. All liberals also support the censorship and denial of Christianity. Liberals who are a part of the secular left prefer the atheist religion over the Christian faith, as atheism has no objective morality to hinder their big government plans. Increasingly, liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including homosexual ""marriage"". Liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working._

Well, the stuff about Christianity is wrong, but Clinton has long been on the side of gays, believes government programs and ""spending"" are good, supports gov-run healthcare reform, and government run social programs (aka ""endless entitlements""). 

Just to be sure. Yup, Coservapedia lists [Clinton as a liberal](http://www.conservapedia.com/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton) in their introduction to her article.

So there are the top 5 relevant definitions for ""liberal"" that I could find, and she more or less fits them all. Care to find any good definitions that she doesn't fit?",2016-08-29 11:33:27+00:00,d712kem,5.0,t1_d70somw,28321.0,PoliticalDiscussion

He gets nervous and is like ""man slow down, I'm in the car, what if a cop pulls us over?"". Jerry laughs, but right after this they get tagged by a traffic cop who pulls them over. The whole time Chris is clearly really nervous, saying ""man this scares me, even with you in the car driving I have to worry about shit going down now"" and Jerry is just like ""whatever, it's just a speeding ticket, we'll be fine"".

341,"No, people live in all the boroughs. The ""under 25 black people"" boroughs are mostly (all?) majority-native population, though. They largely have no road access, identify with tribes that have been living in those areas for 10s of thousands of years, and people live in small villages and mostly lead a subsistence lifestyle, where instead of engaging in economic activity people mostly focus on using farming, fishing, hunting, and gathering to produce their own food and goods. What economic activity that does go on is largely related, in that they might sell the food or goods made from animal byproducts (leather, fur, ivory, etc). So there is a very small population density, but the land there has been continuously populated by the same peoples for longer than anywhere else in the Americas.

Non-native people mostly live in a small sliver of Alaska running up and down the center of the state, and on the Eastern panhandle. Most of Western Alaska and a good portion of the North and Interior is native villages. That said, native subsistence villages are found throughout the entire state, they just don't make up the majority of settlements, and western people live in the native villages too, they are just a very small minority there. 

So the boroughs aren't cordoned off ""people don't live here"" things, but rather demarcate places where people lead a more ""western"" lifestyle vs. living a more subsistence lifestyle. 

Now obviously I'm making huge generalizations here, and if you dig into the specifics you'll find a lot of counter-examples because the world is messy and not easily generalized, and I totally left out stuff like all the giant uninhabited parks, and the oil industry in the north which is almost 100% migrant workers. But it's a sort of ""good enough"" big picture of how the state is organized. 

edit: BTW my source is myself. I grew up in the state, traveled a lot of it doing environmentalist work which required an understanding of internal state politics, and my dad still lives up there and travels to a lot of the native villages building federally-funded infrastructure like airstrips and hangers, which help out the villages but are mostly there so they can be requisitioned by the military in the event of a war with Asia.

It's not just whether there are native speakers available. For instance, some of the Alaskan languages have plenty of native speakers, but no one has acquired the language in 50+ years. Those people learning them now are doing so as adults or older teenagers, and are complete amateurs. They simply have an interest in keeping the traditions of their elders. Arguably, they'll have a harder time keeping their language alive than a community whose language is fully dead with minimal recordings, but who have a number of linguists and educators working with the community to revive the language. 

If you really want to get into it, every language dies with its current generation, reconstructed anew by the next. This is what language acquisition is: children use their UG constraints to guess at what the language they hear around them is. It's why languages change, why children can acquire language with no instruction, why Creoles and home signs are possible, and why (re)conlangs like Esperanto or Hebrew will be acquired and changed significantly by a new generation of speakers.

I'm pretty sure Irish was in the same state a few decades ago before they started teaching it in schools. Recall something from my historical ling classes about that but no specifics. 

These cases are similar in that it's not a direct line of transmission between generations, but different in that they've only been lost for a generation or few, and require different degrees of reconstruction depending on whether there are native speakers left or they're working from recordings. 

So ""long extinct"" is probably inaccurate in my original statement, and the line between preservation and reconstruction gets REALLY blurry when you're talking about languages that have not been natively acquired for several generations but still have a few native speakers alive.

Hebrew wasn't spoken natively by anyone for thousands of years. Modern Hebrew is a reconstruction of what might have been based on what texts we have surviving. Those texts were written at different time periods, so don't reflect any one specific incarnation of the language, and written text generally leaves out a lot of info and has a different tone than spoken language. 

So yes, Hebrew as it is spoken today was constructed consciously, and that included adding elements to it. Then enough to people began speaking it that children could acquire it, so that constructed language has become a natural language through a process not unlike creolization or home sign development. But it is not a creole in that it did not come from a pidgin. Rather, it's a thing that we don't have a word for because it's only happened a few times: a long extinct language that was reconstructed and ""naturalized"". 

As to how close it is to Biblical Hebrew, that's a matter of how close the original conlang was and how far the naturalized version has veered from that. Since Biblical Hebrew was a good portion of the source text used to construct modern Hebrew I'd imagine they're pretty close as far as these things go.

439,"I had several friends IRL who were prototypical BernieBros. I promise you, those people DO exist and it was not an entirely manufactured narrative. 3-10 posts a day about Bernie on Facebook, aggressively arguing on other people's walls, calling black voters ""low-information"" and ""voting against their interests"" after super-Tuesday, telling anyone voting for Clinton they're not liberal, but meanwhile calling Clinton a ""c\*nt"" and ""b\*tch"". Just last week I had a guy call Obama an ""uncle tom"" and threaten to beat me up if he ever sees me in person because I posted something positive about Hillary on a friend's post who was also being positive about Hillary. 

You also can't deny that the hordes of people (mostly young white men) on Twitter who would go after journalists for writing anything that was critical of Bernie were very real. I follow Sarah Jeong for her writing on crypto, and she had to put her Twitter private and stop posting for weeks because she was getting death threats after tweeting a few critical thing about Bernie's campaign, even though she supported him. I watched the whole thing go down live, it was completely insane. What's more, it was orchestrated by the higher-ups at Jacobin Magazine, so it's not like this was some random incident but an actual organized hate mob. I also had another female journalist who I know personally tell me about her experience which was much less public and extreme, but still in the same realm of things: write positive constructive criticism of the Sanders campaign, get death threats and harassment largely from young white male Sanders supporters.

Sure, #notallberniesupporters, but that doesn't mean that the BernieBros didn't exist, and denying that there was a small but very vocal and influential contingent of the grassroots campaign that acted this way really discredited the larger movement in my eyes. When people act hatefully in ""support"" of your cause, you have to denounce them and work to stop their behavior, not deny they exist.

483,"Oh, you mean natural settings. A few come to mind:

2. _Dark Eden_ is fucking phenomenal, by Chris Beckett. Seriously I can't recommend this enough. A tribe of about 500 people live on a wandering planet without a star, which has a bunch of plants that create their own heat and light. The forest is a dazzling spectacle, and a good chunk of the narrative involves exploring the planet further. Beckett nails living in a small society as well.

1. _Ringworld_, _The Integral Trees_, and sequels by Larry Niven. Niven isn't a master storyteller or character writer, but his space-based natural environments are really great. I particularly liked _The Integral Trees_, which features small tribes of humanity living amongst floating, zero-G trees in an oxygen bubble rather than on a planet. Really cool.

3. _The Word for World is Forest_ by Ursula K. Le Guin. Name says it all. Not her best work, but that's like saying it's not the best 3 Michelin Star restaurant you've ever eaten at. 

4. _Hyperion_ gets thrown around a lot in here, but just because it's so good. It's several short stories tied together with a meta-narrative, and a few of the shorts as well as the meta-narrative deal with some really interesting natural environments. The sequel _Fall of Hyperion_ is really just a continuation of the same book, but has less of what you're looking for.

502,"Full Frontal is utterly amazing, and for me does what The Daily Show did at its best during the Bush years. That was such a crazy time, where up was down and Iraq had Schrodinger's WMDs. The world was literally absurd, and Stewart highlighted this absurdity and made it something that we could laugh about. Rather that just feeling fear, we knew we could get through it.

Then we got Obama, and the White House got more sane even while the Senate and House got crazier. However, I think Stewart's project faltered here a little bit, and the show was never as rich or important during the Obama years as it was during the Bush years, where he was literally helping us process and think about what was happening to us as a country. 

But I think Samantha Bee has found a way to do for the modern GOP what Stewart did for the Bush administration. It's smart, it tells a longer story and meta-narrative across her shows, but by having longer segments she can build small narratives each show, while Stewart's joke-based comedy monologues required that they audience already know the issues and characters in the stories—great for the presidency, lousy for smaller issues. Which is why I think Full Frontal is as vital now as The Daily Show was in its prime. And I don't think Trevor is all that bad, he just inherited a format that doesn't work as well as it used to, and _hasn't for a long time_ even under Stewart.

MIT and Carnegie-Mellon are interesting. Only 15% of the graduating class of MIT goes to New York, while 29% go to Cali and 25% stay in Mass. Although California has been raising in the rankings over the last couple of years.

528,"I'm not trying to defend Chomsky in some sort of idealistic way. I think he's wrong over-all, and I think many of his defenses are wrong-headed. 

But he's wrong in a much more interesting way than people are claiming here. Again, it feels like folks are doing the knee-jerk based on what they've read ABOUT Chomsky, rather than based on reading him. A lot of his defenses are not necessarily ""they have no culpability"", but rather pointing out that the US is also culpable and that our imperialist foreign policy has consequences. You have to realize that was a totally insane concept when he started writing, one that few other people were articulating in any meaningful way. 

And BTW, I have read a bunch of his writings in linguistics and I have a tonne of issues with those, too. The whole UG thing is a good idea but ultimately wrong, and Minimalism is just bullshit. _But_ he also revolutionized the field by saying ""hey, we can study languages using the scientific method instead of just cataloguing them"", so the work he's done is really important and has to be grappled with in order to understand it, even if ultimately the conclusions are wrong.",2016-06-24 00:29:54+00:00,d4lkhfb,8.0,t1_d4lgt04,5532.0,enoughsandersspam

530,"/u/John-Carlton-King's is an incredibly unfair summary of Chomsky, one that makes me suspect that he's never read Chomsky's work and is just paraphrasing his critics. 

Chomsky's underlying philosophical assumption is that in a democracy, every single person is morally responsible for the actions of their leaders. Thus, when our government kills innocent civilians in Iraq, that blood is on our hands and we should deal with that fact, not sweep it away as acceptable because we are on the right side. 

The place people get confused is that does not mean (to Chomsky) that we can or even necessarily should stop killing civilians in Iraq. Clearly fewer deaths are better, but the world isn't perfect. He's more pessimistic about our military actually being able to keep us safe and he rightly points out that killing innocent civilians in Iraq is going to send more people into the arms of ISIS, but that doesn't mean that the US can only do bad things. Only that we _do_ do bad things, usually in the name of good, but doing bad things for good reasons is still doing bad things. 

You can disagree with this philosophy or with the facts he uses to justify it (and I do disagree with both at times), but a lot of people would rather ridicule him without actually engaging with what he's saying because it's complicated, nuanced, and hard.

Republican rival Donald Trump has attacked Mrs. Clinton repeatedly on the issue, calling her “Crooked Hillary,’’ saying what she did was a crime and suggesting the Justice Department would let her off because it is run by Democrats.

Beyond the campaign implications, the investigation exposes the latest chapter in a power struggle that pits the enforcers of strict secrecy, including the FBI and CIA, against some officials at the State Department and other agencies who want a greater voice in the use of covert lethal force around the globe, because of the impact it has on broader U.S. policy goals.

####[Pakistani villagers offered prayers for people reportedly killed by a U.S. drone attack in Miranshah in the tribal region of North Waziristan on June 16, 2011. PHOTO: AP](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-OK477_0609em_P_20160609160015.jpg)

In the case of Pakistan, U.S. diplomats found themselves in a difficult position.

Despite being treated as top secret by the CIA, the drone program has long been in the public domain in Pakistan. Television stations there go live with reports of each strike, undermining U.S. efforts to foster goodwill and cooperation against militants through billions of dollars in American aid.

Pakistani officials, while publicly opposing the drone program, secretly consented to the CIA campaign by clearing airspace in the militant-dense tribal areas along the Afghan border, according to former U.S. and Pakistani officials.

CIA and White House officials credit a sharp ramp-up in drone strikes early in Mr. Obama’s presidency with battering al Qaeda’s leadership in the Pakistani tribal areas and helping protect U.S. forces next door in Afghanistan. Targets have also included some of the Pakistan government’s militant enemies.

In 2011, Pakistani officials began to push back in private against the drone program, raising questions for the U.S. over the extent to which the program still had their consent.

U.S. diplomats warned the CIA and White House they risked losing access to Pakistan’s airspace unless more discretion was shown, said current and former officials. Within the administration, State Department and military officials argued that the CIA needed to be more “judicious” about when strikes were launched. They weren’t challenging the spy agency’s specific choice of targets, but mainly the timing of strikes.

The CIA initially chafed at the idea of giving the State Department more of a voice in the process. Under a compromise reached around the year 2011, CIA officers would notify their embassy counterparts in Islamabad when a strike in Pakistan was planned, so then-U.S. ambassador Cameron Munter or another senior diplomat could decide whether to “concur” or “non-concur.” Mr. Munter declined to comment.

Diplomats in Islamabad would communicate the decision to their superiors in Washington. A main purpose was to give then-Secretary of State Clinton and her top aides a chance to consider whether she wanted to weigh in with the CIA director about a planned strike.

With the compromise, State Department-CIA tensions began to subside. Only once or twice during Mrs. Clinton’s tenure at State did U.S. diplomats object to a planned CIA strike, according to congressional and law-enforcement officials familiar with the emails.

U.S. diplomats in Pakistan and Washington usually relayed and discussed their concur or non-concur decisions via the State Department’s more-secure messaging system. But about a half-dozen times, when they were away from more-secure equipment, they improvised by sending emails on their smartphones about whether they backed an impending strike or not, the officials said.

The time available to the State Department to weigh in on a planned strike varied widely, from several days to as little as 20 or 30 minutes. “If a strike was imminent, it was futile to use the high side, which no one would see for seven hours,” said one official.

Adding to those communications hurdles, U.S. intelligence officials privately objected to the State Department even using its high-side system. They wanted diplomats to use a still-more-secure system called the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Community Systems, or JWICs. State Department officials don’t have ready access to that system, even in Washington. If drone-strike decisions were needed quickly, it wouldn’t be an option, officials said.

Some officials chafed at pressure to send internal deliberations through intelligence channels, since they were discussing whether to push back against the CIA, congressional officials said.

The [Wall Street Journal first reported on the State Department-CIA](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304563104576363812217915914) tug-of-war over the drone program in 2011.

Under pressure to address critics abroad, Mr. Obama pledged to increase the transparency of drone operations by shifting, as much as possible, control of drone programs around the world to the U.S. military instead of the CIA. An exception was made for Pakistan.

But even in Pakistan, Mr. Obama recently signaled a shift. The drone strike that killed Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour last month was conducted by the military, not the CIA, and the outcome was disclosed.

While the CIA still controls drones over the tribal areas of Pakistan near Afghanistan, the pace of strikes has declined dramatically in recent years. U.S. officials say there are fewer al Qaeda targets there now that the CIA can find.

607,"By ADAM ENTOUS and  DEVLIN BARRETT  
Updated June 9, 2016 10:19 p.m. ET  

At the center of a criminal probe involving Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information is a series of emails between American diplomats in Islamabad and their superiors in Washington about whether to oppose specific drone strikes in Pakistan.

The 2011 and 2012 emails were sent via the “low side’’—government slang for a computer system for unclassified matters—as part of a secret arrangement that gave the State Department more of a voice in whether a Central Intelligence Agency drone strike went ahead, according to congressional and law-enforcement officials briefed on the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe.

Some of the emails were then forwarded by Mrs. Clinton’s aides to her personal email account, which routed them to a server she kept at her home in suburban New York when she was secretary of state, the officials said. Investigators have raised concerns that Mrs. Clinton’s personal server was less secure than State Department systems.

####[A redacted email sent in 2011 by the then-U.S. ambassador to Pakistan and answered by a top aide to Hillary Clinton.](http://graphics.wsj.com/hillary-clinton-email-documents/pdfs/C05785960.pdf) (pdf)

The vaguely worded messages didn’t mention the “CIA,” “drones” or details about the militant targets, officials said.

The still-secret emails are a key part of the FBI investigation that has long dogged Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, these officials said.

They were written within the often-narrow time frame in which State Department officials had to decide whether or not to object to drone strikes before the CIA pulled the trigger, the officials said.

Law-enforcement and intelligence officials said State Department deliberations about the covert CIA drone program should have been conducted over a more secure government computer system designed to handle classified information.

State Department officials told FBI investigators they communicated via the less-secure system on a few instances, according to congressional and law-enforcement officials. It happened when decisions about imminent strikes had to be relayed fast and the U.S. diplomats in Pakistan or Washington didn’t have ready access to a more-secure system, either because it was night or they were traveling.

One such exchange came just before Christmas in 2011, when the U.S. ambassador sent a short, cryptic note to his boss indicating a drone strike was planned. That sparked a back-and-forth among Mrs. Clinton’s senior advisers over the next few days, in which it was clear they were having the discussions in part because people were away from their offices for the holiday and didn’t have access to a classified computer, officials said.

The CIA drone campaign, though widely reported in Pakistan, is treated as secret by the U.S. government. Under strict U.S. classification rules, U.S. officials have been barred from discussing strikes publicly and even privately outside of secure communications systems.

The State Department said in January that 22 emails on Mrs. Clinton’s personal server at her home have been judged to contain top-secret information and aren’t being publicly released. Many of them dealt with whether diplomats concurred or not with the CIA drone strikes, congressional and law-enforcement officials said.

Several law-enforcement officials said they don’t expect any criminal charges to be filed as a result of the investigation, although a final review of the evidence will be made only after an expected FBI interview with Mrs. Clinton this summer.

One reason is that government workers at several agencies, including the departments of Defense, Justice and State, have occasionally resorted to the low-side system to give each other notice about sensitive but fast-moving events, according to one law-enforcement official.

When Mrs. Clinton has been asked about the possibility of being criminally charged over the email issue, she has repeatedly said “that is not going to happen.’’ She has said it was a mistake to use a personal server for email but it was a decision she made as a matter of convenience.

Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said: “If these officials’ descriptions are true, these emails were originated by career diplomats, and the sending of these types of emails was widespread within the government.”

U.S. officials said there is no evidence Pakistani intelligence officials intercepted any of the low-side State Department emails or used them to protect militants.

State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the agency “is not going to speak to the content of documents, nor would we speak to any ongoing review.’’

622,"Yeah it's kind of a weird system. I mean, I've put on large events and understand that they just cost an insane amount of money to put together. For instance: there are ~4500 delegates, and they have an average cost of ~$4000 to be at the convention, which means that the costs for the delegates being at the convention alone are **$18 million**. So for the DNC not to be able to take all that on when they're already sinking millions of dollars into the convention kind of makes sense.

That campaigns can't pay for their delegates (or even just book rooms in the hotel) in particular is a strange set-up. But again, it's also one that makes sense—otherwise there is the potential for corruption, campaigns paying for delegates but demanding they vote a certain way b/c they've been paid for. That's the way of these things. Each individual rule will be there for a really good reason, but the emergent outcome of all those rules is a system that doesn't make anyone happy.

It's tough though. The 13 Alaskan Bernie delegates alone need to raise something like $60,000-70,000 in total to get to the convention, and so far they've only raised about $15,000. That's a huge gap to make up for, and the longer it takes to do it, the _more_ expensive things like flights and hotel rooms will be. And it's hard to raise that amount of money when you're only a few people and you're trying to make it up through small, community-based donations.

Are you allowed to get corporate sponsorship?

The fact that you guys are all working together really helps you out.

So if you can also work with Clinton's Alaskan delegates, you'll engender yourself to the voters in the lower 48 who can help, as well as opening up the door to getting larger sponsorship deels (which lets be realistic, is the fastest and easiest way to raise the 10s of thousands of dollars you all need).

  &gt; ""What has upset me, and what I think is -- I wouldn't use the word 'rigged' because we knew what the rules were -- but what is really dumb, is that you have closed primaries, like in New York State, where three million people who were Democrats or Republicans could not participate,"" Sanders added. ""You have a situation where over 400 super delegates came on board Clinton's campaign before anybody else was in the race, eight months before the first vote was cast. That's not rigged, I think it's just a dumb **process which has certainly disadvantaged our campaign**.""

  Notice that he's only complaining about the things that hurt him (such as Republicans not being allowed to vote in the Democratic primary), not the things that helped (such as mf caucuses).

680,"Yeah, the closed/open thing is clearly just a matter of ""it hurt me so I don't like it"". I think there are legitimate arguments for having both, just like I think there are legitimate arguments for having a primary season rather than day. But those are not the arguments that Bernie is making.

Humour me for a second. If I could re-design the Democratic primaries from scratch, paying no mind to current power structures and special interests, I'd do something along these lines:

# New Democratic Primaries

Primaries happen over 6 weeks. Primaries happen either on Tuesday or Saturday of that week, as chosen by states except in some circumstances laid out below. Rules for the debates and the convention are also laid out below. 

The first week, the top 5 swing states vote on Tuesday. These are selected by the DNC a year in advance, and in exchange for going first _must_ be open primaries. In addition, on that Saturday the super-delegates vote in a non-binding, anonymous vote. All supers must vote, however, or they lose their superdelegate status.

In the second week, the top remaining 10 states that most closely reflect the demographics of the US as a whole vote. These states each hold 2 electrons: an open primary on Tuesday, and a closed caucus on Saturday. The results from each of these count for 1/2 of the pledged delegates available to that state. The results for both the primaries and caucuses will be announced after the caucuses are completed on Saturday.

In the 3rd week, the top 10 remaining states which have the largest proportion of non-white registered Democrats vote. These states must hold closed primaries. 

In the 4th week, the super-delegates vote for realsies and in the open this time. Even if their candidate later drops out, they're still committed for the first convention vote. Again, any supers who don't vote lose their super status. 

In the 5th week, the 15 remaining smallest states + all non-state entities vote. They may either hold an open primary, a closed primary, or both a primary and a caucus as per the rules below.

In the 6th week, the remaining 10 states vote. Open/closed/caucus is state's choice as per week 5.

## The Convention

In week 8, the convention happens. The ""first vote"" is not actually taken on the floor, but is rather calculated based on all the previous primaries. If no candidate has achieved 1/2 of the total delegates, then the floor opens up the the 2nd vote which is taken immediately with no debate. 

In the 2nd vote, the only delegates (super or pledged) who may change their vote are those who are at the convention and whose ""first vote"" candidate has formally dropped out before the first vote is confirmed or suspended their campaign without reopening it before the convention.

If still no candidate has achieved 1/2 of the total delegates, then the convention is contested and all delegates are unbound and the convention may move into debate and/or more votes as per the rules of the convention. From this point on, if during any vote a candidate wins more than 1/2 of the delegates voting, that candidate has won the nomination. 

## Further Rules

### Debates

Debates happen on weeks -4, -1, 1, 3, 5, and 6 if necessary—always on a Sunday afternoon or Monday evening. 

### Superdelegates

Superdelegates may publicly endorse a candidate at any time, but those endorsements don't really mean anything and they may _not_ commit to voting for the candidate, only express that they hope they win. State parties, governments, or voters may not attempt by rules, incentives, or punishments to bound their superdelegates to the statewide vote in any way—supers should vote their _own_ conscience. 

Superdelegates cannot make up over 1/5th of the total delegate count. 

### States' Choice

Any state which does not abide by the rules set forth here will not have their pledged or superdelegates confirmed for the convention, nor will those delegates count towards the ""delegate total"" at the convention. 

### Proportional Allotment of Pledged Delegates

Pledged delegates decided by primaries are awarded proportionally to either the top 3 candidates or to all the candidates who achieved more than 15% of the vote, whichever number is larger. However, pledged delegates are not awarded to candidates which have dropped out or suspended their campaign without reopening it within 24 hours of the results being finalized. 

### Caucuses

If a state in week 5 or 6 would like to hold a caucus, then it must follow these rules:

1. The state must hold the caucus on a Saturday.
2. The state must also hold primary on the Tuesday before.
3. The primary and caucus must either both be open, or both closed.
4. Results of both the primary and caucus will be announced together, once the caucus has been completed.
5. The primary and caucus may either each award 1/2 of the pledged delegates for that state, in which case they are both bound by the regular proportional allotment rules for pledged delegates, or one may award 1/3 the delegates and the other 2/3, in which case the former is winner-take-all while the latter follows the usual proportional allotment rules. 

### Eligibility

To run for the Democratic Presidential Nomination, candidates must have served at least 2 years out of the last 10 as either an elected or appointed official in either State or Federal government as a Democrat, or have formal endorsements from at least 10 Democratic representatives, 3 Democratic senators, and a total of 5% of the superdelegates by the time of the first debate.

692,"I understand what galaxies are and how far apart they are. 

What I'm saying is that most pieces of art have a point of view. And that point of view must be _inside_ a galaxy if you're going to show nebulae, otherwise they'd be too small to show up. So if you'd also like to show other galaxies in that same painting, at least have them somehow occluded or behind the nebulae. 

Even though galaxies are super far away, and nebulae much less so, they can still take up about [the same amount of space in the night sky](http://i.imgur.com/RAWoQAp.jpg). We just don't see them at all because they're too faint: which is the whole point of space art like the ""astronomy photos"" that NASA releases and which this painting is clearly aping, to show us what space would look like if these things were visible and colourful. 

edit: Clearly you understand how occlusion can work to create perspective in space art, since you do that very thing [in this painting](http://vilest.deviantart.com/art/Lair-of-the-Dreaming-357799331) (which is really cool, btw).",2016-05-26 18:40:01+00:00,d3kro9e,10.0,t1_d3km3o7,7081.0,ImaginaryStarscapes

Ta-Nehisi Coates' first **Black Panther** comic was released last month, so I picked that up. It's excellent writing, as you'd expect from TNC, although being the first in a run of 12 it's a lot of world building and domino setting. Looking forward to watching the plot pick up.

I also picked up [_The Wicked + The Divine_](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/the-wicked-the-divine), a graphic series written by Kieron Gillen. It's about decadent music culture and fanatical devotion to pop icons. In the story, 12 pop stars find out that they are actual gods, and we see their rise to fame and burn out from POV of one of their groupies.

770,"I'm currently reading the last of NK Jemisin's books and I'm so gutted that I am going to have to wait until August for any more once I'm finished with this one.

Can we just turn this into a Jemisin thread? Here's my thoughts on all of her 6 novels:

1. _The Fifth Season_. HOLY SHIT this is one of my favorite fantasies, ever. Seriously it's up there with _Lord of the Rings_ and _Under Heaven_ in my book. Great characters, women characters who were so much more than bullshit ""plucky female protagonist"" wank fantasies, amazing worldbuilding, and some really cool (successful) experimental writing techniques. I can't stop talking about this book. I'm a total sucker for apocalypse and ancient technological magic and inherently unstable magic so it pretty much ticks all my boxes.

2. _The Killing Moon_. I loved the ancient Egypt flavor, and I liked that she managed to do it without it just being Egypt with a little magic added in. The magic was awesome and Jungian, the politics were really well done, and the story was gut-wrenching.

3. _The Kingdom of Gods_. 3rd book in the Inheritance trilogy, and the one I'm liking the best so far although I'm only 1/2 way through it. I can't say much without spoiling the others, but I think that not only is it the best-written of the three, it also makes good on little hints dropped in the previous two. The main character and their plight is super-compelling to me, which would only be the case because of how the other two books built him up as a side character.

4. _The Broken Kingdoms_. 2nd book in the Inheritance trilogy. Was good, took the worldbuilding from the first book and really ran with it. I was maybe less invested in the storytelling techniques in this one compared to the first, but I thought the main character was a bit more compelling and had more agency in the plot. 

5. _The Shadowed Sun_. Sequel to _Killing Moon_. Not quite as good, unfortunately. It does a good job of building on the events of the first novel, but the main character just didn't really do it for me, nor did the desert barbarians thing. In addition, the move away from the death/dream/majick was disappointing, and the hard-core graphic sexual violence was a bit much for me. 

6. _The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms_. 1st Inheritance book. This is Jemisin's first published novel, and it kind of shows. It's really ambitious, and I _LOVED_ the worldbuilding, but the main character is supposed to be this great warrior princess, but spends most the book moping or having the plot happen to her. While this somewhat makes sense given that she's pulled out of her element into a world of deep political intrigue, I felt that she didn't really have any agency in the story so I just didn't actually buy the ""strong warrior leader"" thing. Otherwise, the novel is really good, still better than 75%  of fantasy I've read. 

Apparently Jemisin lives in my city and we have some mutual friends, so hopefully I will bump into her at a party one of these days so I can ~~fanboy out at her~~ let her know in person how much I've enjoyed her writing. ",2016-04-26 02:49:17+00:00,d2hg1bs,3.0,t1_d2h4b7k,17569.0,SubredditDrama

777,"I thought you were asking for _more_ topics.

I'll write up some better thoughts later, I'm on a business trip now. But I'd try to find one central theme/idea, and have all the lessons touch on that some how. 

So maybe the theme is ""how individual people do science"" or maybe the theme is ""how the methodologies of science have changed"" or ""how institutions do science"". Then teach everything from that perspective.

Some lessons will just fall away as irrelevant, others you'll realize are actually one lesson just from different perspectives, that kind of thing. 

I personally like the ""individuals"" one. It's little close for comfort to the ""great men"" theory of history, but it allows you to tell human/personal stories as your lectures, which kids can really get into.

So the types of horror that is more ""existential horror"" or ""cosmic horror""—less about blood/guts/magic/etc., and more about the terrifying reality of a world in which humanity ultimately doesn't matter. 

Lovecraft is clearly one of the forefathers of the genre (along with Howard), and the big names working in it now are China Miéville, Laird Barron, Jeff VanderMeer, and Thomas Ligotti, with JG Ballard acting as a sort of bridge between these two eras of weird fiction.

Jeff has edited at least one anthology of weird literature, so if we can nail down a date for the Q&amp;A with him that'd be a great place to ask about it.",2016-04-13 13:33:32+00:00,d213vdi,1.0,t3_4elepz,2440.0,SF_Book_Club

Right now, the media previews are really nice for link posts. You really get a sense of what the post is, and it all works great.

However, self posts and links to articles get _totally_ lost in the mix. They're small, the headlines are small, and it's easy to just scroll past them.

I'd be great if you bolded or otherwise made bigger the headlines _only_ for those posts that don't have a media preview. This way they have the same place in the visual hierarchy as media posts do.

Or maybe have a text/article preview, so you see a picture if available + the first few lines of the article or self posts.

(1) is evidence that Rowling doesn't really care about Native American cultures even though she's explicitly writing about them. She cares enough to show the wealth of English and French and even modern American cultures, so this bias against Native American cultures is unique in her writing, and further marginalizes an already marginalized people. Hiding behind ""it's a fake world"" doesn't work here, because she uses real English and French and American cultures, so is treating Native American cultures differently from the way she does all the other real-world cultures she depicts.

898,"Dude, I did this professionally. My knives were great. 

Think of it this way. You might, if you're cooking _WAY_ more than average, spend an hour in the kitchen a day. 7 hours a week. That was a single shift for me, and I had usually 6-8 shifts a week (gotta love those doubles). So in the course of a month, I'd have spent as much time using my knives as you would in 6-8 months. 

And, I'd use them _much_ harder in that time. When you cook, you do so for what, 4 people? Each shift, I'd cook for 60-200 people. If you cut a half onion for your salad a day, I cut closer to 15 a day. If you chopped 2 carrots for your soup, I chopped closer to 200 (seriously). Have you ever taken the skin off a slab of bacon? Butchered 20 chickens? So if I was cooking for 100 people a shift, that means each of my hours saw 3x the amount of use of the home cook's hour.

In other words, in a month I could easily use my knives more than a home cook would in a year and a half. Which honestly, surprised me after I rant the math.

I get it, now that I don't cook professionally I almost never sharpen my knives. But I guarantee you that you're seriously underestimating how much a professional will use her knives in the kitchen, and you're also probably over-due for getting your knives sharped. I'd highly recommend taking them to someone, it's usually not that expensive and your knife will feel like a brand new tool.

I'm copying it below because 538's linking system is kind of broken and it might not show up above:

&gt; Pragmatism about black political interests and how the game is played is likely the primary factor, since Sanders has also spoken to issues of core interest to black voters.

&gt; But a candidate speaking to the issues that a demographic cares about isn’t enough, no matter your race, and particularly so for black voters. Many black voters could support Sanders’s positions, but if they don’t think he knows how to wrangle Congress, there’s a risk in voting for him. I can’t help but think of President Lyndon B. Johnson wrangling an ambivalent Congress to pass civil rights legislation. He was known for his ability to work inside the political system, which may be tactically more important for black voters than white voters.

&gt;I’ve seen some self-described white Sanders voters express anger on social media, saying that black people are voting against their interests. But one of the roles the president plays is interacting with Congress and pushing (or aiming to block) the passage of legislation. And black and white voters have very different experiences with government when it comes to supporting legislation. [This University of Chicago study](https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/ssrn-id2583495.pdf) (pdf) shows how, all other factors aside, black support for legislation means it’s less likely to be passed. _If white voters support a bill, it’s much more likely to be passed and adopted. But if black voters support legislation, it’s actually less likely to pass. That argues that black voters may have a tactical interest in an establishment candidate they think can work behind the scenes in their interest, and there’s a perception that Clinton may be better at insider politics._ That also tracks with the broader support on the Democratic side for an experienced candidate, versus on the GOP side for an anti-establishment candidate.

Emphasis mine. Pretty much, it's what Ta-Nehisi Coates has been saying all along: being poor and black is different from just being poor because of systematic racism, so just attacking class issues won't fix all matters of inequality, and black voters are smart enough to realize that.",2016-03-02 04:49:03+00:00,d0kcvqd,4.0,t1_d0k4x0a,11980.0,SandersForPresident

932,"A few that immediately came to mind are:

* _Cloud Atlas_ by David Mitchell. 6 interconnected stories told in genres from historical travelogue to far-future science fiction. Really cool.

* _The Book of Strange New Things_ by Michel Faber. This might be a little magical realist / surreal for your tastes, but I loved it. A priest from our current era goes on a mission trip to a newly discovered planet while his wife stays home at Earth, the novel is about their long-distance relationship and the toll it takes on both of them, and his surprising success proselytizing to the natives.

* Less on the SF and literary side of things, but I read a bunch of techno-thrillers as a kid that fit this description. I haven't read any of these in over a decade though, so they probably don't hold up. Some of my favorites then were:

  * _Relic_, _Reliquary_, and _Riptide_ by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Childe. 

  * Pretty much anything by Michael Crichton, especially _Sphere_, _Congo_, and _Timeline_.

  * James Rollins' _Excavation_. 

* Neal Stephenson does this well. _Cryptonomicon_ and _Seveneves_ are both set in more or less modern day: the first is about computers and cryptography, the second about a doomsday scenario and humanity's fight to save itself by becoming space-bound. His Baroque Cycle novels might be up your alley if you like historical stuff.

* For some reason I want to recommend _Speaker for the Dead_ to you. While it's kinda a space opera, it's mostly spent on one small back-water planet with a small town catholic culture, but dealing with the aliens at its back door. I liked it more than _Ender's Game_, which it is a sequel to.

It's great, definitely one of my top-10 SF novels.

If you liked _Cryptonomicon_, the Baroque Cycle books (_System of the World_ etc) by Stephenson are historical novels set in the same universe about the invention of computers and modern financial systems.

Stephenson's most recent novel, _Seveneves_, explores what it would take to save humanity by building space stations in the even that the world was going to become uninhabitable in just a few years' time. I loved it, and it definitely has the vibe you're going for.

973,"_Getting More_ by Stuart Diamond is probably the book that's helped me the most. It's not about management _per se_, but rather about how to have meaningful conversations in a way where both you and the other party get what you need out of the interaction. Unlike a lot of ""negotiation"" books, it gets that tricking people might lead to short term gains, but not long term relationship building (which is a lot of what management is).

I also rather liked Bridgewater's [Principles](http://www.bwater.com/Uploads/FileManager/Principles/Bridgewater-Associates-Ray-Dalio-Principles.pdf) (pdf). Bridgewater is the largest, most successful Hedge Fund in the world, and they do management in a way that is different from a lot of places. However, even if you work in a more traditional work environment, there's a lot to gain from reading it. This is because it really does start from first principles. There are a lot of sections about being honest about people's abilities and helping them realize where they can do the best work, and then helping them do that. Most important job of a manager, that. Also, it's free. 

Other than those two, I haven't read a lot that's very good. There is a lot of bad advice out there from bad managers. 

As /u/_Rabbert_Klein points out, a lot of management is realizing that people are _different_ and that you need to interact with them in different ways. You're not necessarily out to be their friend, but rather _to help them succeed_. Everything should be viewed through that lens, because the more your employees succeed, the more you do. It can be a tough mental shift to let happen, but it's really true.

Hey, so I and some others were kind of douchey to you. I realize that you're just starting out with this stuff, so having a bunch of people jump down your throat for asking questions isn't exactly fun or useful. I apologize for being a bit of a dick.

That video is of Ray Mears sharpening his knives. Starting at about 3:50, he sharpens a scandi-grind knife—that is, a knife which like the Mora has a single, long bevel. He goes into how and why to use whetstones and a strop to get a mirror finish, razor sharp blade. 

I do want to point out that even in the backwoods, he brings a mini-stone with him. Any stone you find is nature is not going to be flat enough to actually sharpen your blade, and in all but the worst circumstances is going to not only make it more dull, but permanently damage it in the process. 

If I were you, I'd invest in a simple combination water stone, something [like this](http://www.sharpeningsupplies.com/Naniwa-Economical-Waterstone-Set-P561.aspx) is a full kit, but you can get away with just getting a combi stone and laying the wet stone down on a kitchen towel on your counter. 

Even with the Istor sharpener, you're not going to get a very good edge. Those kinds of things are fine for a home kitchen, but really won't hold up in any professional or survival situation.",2016-02-12 05:05:54+00:00,czwzma3,3.0,t1_czum9kn,152960.0,Bushcraft

That said, there can be something beneficial about both (1) coming at SF with a more literary attitude (as Banks himself did) and (2) ignoring previous genre conventions when trying to make something original. So ""traps"" isn't meant to be purely negative.

In the specific case of Atwood's _Oryx and Crake_, I'd say this mostly comes in the form of the video game that Oryx and Snowman play as kids. It, to me, felt tired and unrealistic. In addition, the post-apocalypse was pretty ""meh"" compared to the dystopian, pre-apocalypse. And even that ran some pretty tired and typical territory (bad corporations, genetic engineering gone amok) without really seeming to realize that those themes have been played with before.

Over-all, I think that _Oryx and Crake_ is actually **better** for Atwood not being a traditional scifi author—her characters are wonderful, her wordplay is excellent, and she does have a new take on the cloning / genetic engineering question, but there are also some rough edges that are caused by that same fact.

1054,"Everyone is saying that this is likely, but it's really not. Sanders wasn't able to win against Hillary in his [3rd most viable state](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/bernie-sanders-could-win-iowa-and-new-hampshire-then-lose-everywhere-else/), he's not going to get [close to the number of delegates he needs](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanders-needs-more-than-the-tie-he-got-in-iowa/) at his current rate.

Let's say it does happen, though. This is literally be the outcome that the system is designed to produce in these cases. While many Bernie supporters on the ground would be upset, they have literally no power inside the Democratic institution (which is the platform that Bernie is running on) so the system itself is unlikely to change. The party elites will see it as having performed its role properly. 

That said, due to the unrest it will cause within the Dem voter's ranks, Hillary will be more or less forced to bring Bernie on as either the VP running mate, or make an early announcement that he's going to take a cabinet-level position. Not doing so will hurt the over-all Dem voter turnout in key states like Ohio (whose Democrats are largely white, middle-to-lower class voters). 

In getting him on her side, she'll probably have to make one or two key domestic policy changes, most likely around something safe like making college cheaper. I imagine Bernie would push to get Secretary of the Treasury, while he's much more likely to get Labor, Health and Human Services, or maybe Education. The policy changes she makes will likely have something to do with the position that he's given (which is why I don't think he'd get Treasury as much as he'd push for it).

In the end, I think Bernie will be willing to compromise in order to focus on making real political change in at least one of his pet projects and to ensure that it's not one of the Republicans who wins the presidential race.

Bernie will then have 4 years as either VP or in a cabinet-level position to make some changes before he's dumped in or after Clinton's re-election campaign.

Honestly, as long as Bernie continues to do as well as he is amongst his demographics (young white voters) then I could see this outcome being more or less the same, although the better he does and the more superdelegates play a role, the better his bargaining position will be to get the role he wants.

But even if it wasn't, the sub has evolved _a lot_ over the past 5 and a half years, and I'm not sure my original intentions matter. I mean, originally I and /u/punninglinguist just choose the books we wanted to read with no reader input at all, I'm sure you don't want that original intention to take precedent over the later innovation of letting people vote :-)

Unfortunately, reddit's software doesn't let us change the name to reflect any change in purpose, but it doesn't really bother me and I'm not sure I'd change it even if I could.

And re: scifi_bookclub, the last thing I want is for it to be a feeder here! I'm personally of the opinion that competition is good when it comes to subreddits. I have never wanted to create a catch-all scifi book club that everyone wants to join. I want to have a small community of other cool people who also want to read weird, idiosyncratic books that generally and imperfectly fit into the SFF-ish mold. 

And I'm more than happy to do what I can to help the people who don't like that, and want to be a part of a more classical scifi book club.

Hell, I'd happily read a work of non-fiction here if it made sense and the community voted on it (I think _1491_ would make an amazing book for SFBC, for instance). 

I stay vague because the world is vague. We're not trying to be everything for everyone, to have a any sort of mass appeal. 

This was all much easier when /r/scifi_bookclub was actively reading and discussing classic science fiction.

1145,"Picking a particular story is hard, so I'm going to focus on the writers who I think consistently write great short stories.

* Jorge Luis Borges. There's an argument that Borges is one of the best short story authors ever, in any genre. His release _Labyrinths_ is a must-read for any short story lovers, especially if you like stories that encapsulate mind-bending ideas. 

* Octavia Butler. She only wrote a handful of short stories in her career, but they number amongst the best SF shorts ever written. Her collection _Bloodchild_ collects them all. 

* Robert Sheckley. A new-wave writer before its time. While others in the genre were writing about manly men being manly, Sheckley used the ""first contact"" conceit to show us how absurd our own customs and beliefs are. His collection _Store of the Worlds_ is a great place to start. The story ""warbirds"" predicted our current fears about UAVs and drones 60 years before they were invented.

* J.G. Ballard. While known for his novels about cars, his short stories are truly some of the best ever written about the modern condition. There is a best-of collection that's worth picking up. He and Sheckley share a lot of the same literary DNA, although Ballard is the much better known of the authors.

* Harlan Ellison. Not only did he write ""I Have No Mouth and I must Scream"" and ""Repent, Harlequin! said the Ticktockman"", he brought together the Dangerous Visions short story collections, the first of which pretty much kick started the ""new wave"" science fiction movement and revitalized the genre.

* Isaac Asimov. The best of the golden age short story writers. No one else can craft such a perfect puzzle box of words as he could. Any Asimov story collection is one worth picking up, and his writing about writing is phenomenal as well.

* Ted Chiang. Just get _Stories of your Life and Others_. You can thank us all later.",2016-01-08 19:18:18+00:00,cyqxmem,1.0,t3_401c0a,16637.0,printSF

1162,"This year was a good one for reading for me, although December fell short. The only thing I read was Elena Ferrante's _My Brilliant Friend_, and I've only gotten half-way through that. 

My favorite novels of the year were:

* _The Book of Strange New Things_ by Michel Faber. We're reading this in /r/SF_Book_Club this month, which I'm super-excited about because it's an amazing book. 

* _Dark Eden_ by Chris Beckett. I really enjoyed the world that Beckett built and the somewhat untraditional hero's journey that the story focused on.

* _Bear Daughter_ by Judith Berman. A fantasy novel in a world based on Pacific Northwest Native American mythology, this tells the story of a young girl who is part bear, and must travel to the edges of the world to pay off a debt that one side of her family owes to the other. It's a really powerful story and a beautiful world. I also liked that it's a hero's journey, but told from the perspective of a young girl as opposed to young boy, which definitely colors the entire thing differently. Well worth picking up used since it is sadly out of print.

* _The Whispering Muse_ and _The Blue Fox_ by Sjón. An Icelandic poet and novelist, these short novels both have a fantastical edge to them, of the sort that you can only see out of the corner of your eye. Both feature less than sympathetic protagonists. And both are beautifully written. If you see one, definitely pick it up, you'll read it in a few hours.

* _Crystal Rain_ by Tobais S. Buckell. This is my cross to bear this year. I have been reading it for five or six months, and still am only half-way through if that. I am loving it, but I keep getting distracted by other books. It's set on a primitive world far in the future that has lost contact with the rest of the galaxy. There is an Aztec-based culture that is raining war down on a Caribbean-based culture with the help of their ""gods"" (clearly some sort of posthuman/robot entities). It's a really cool ""technology so advanced it's magic"" type of story.

* _Seveneves_ by Neal Stephenson. This book divided a lot of people, but I absolutely loved it. It was like one of my golden age adventure story favorites, but updated with modern science and with a cast that is not all boring white dudes. Stephenson isn't afraid to give even his female characters major character flaws, which in a genre over-stuffed with ""plucky female protagonists"" is a breath of fresh air. 

* The War Against the Chtorr by David Gerrold. Gerrold announced that he'd finished the 5th volume in the series after 20 years of working on it, so I went back and re-read all the old ones. Fuck are they fantastic. Gory and anarchist and depraved and perverted and fantastic.

* _10:04_ by Ben Lerner. I love Lerner's novels and poetry, so was really excited when I came across a hard cover of this a few weeks after it was published at my local book store, because I hadn't known he was working on a new novel. I loved his descriptions of a New York City jerking its way into the future one super storm at a time. 

* _Infinite Jest_ by David Foster Wallace. I re-read it this year, and was surprised by how science fictional and plot-driven it was once you looked past the fragmented narrative and the strong characters. 

* _Three Moments of an Explosion_ by China Miéville. Fucking awesome. 

Some disappointing novels I read were:

* The Southern Reach Trilogy. I really enjoyed the first book, but the second fell flat for me. In explaining some of the mysteries and being weird for weird's sake, it just didn't have the magic of the first one. I haven't read the final third yet.

* _The Goldfinch_ by Donna Tartt. This book blew up the literary establishment, and I read it at the urging of my girlfriend. Honestly though, if she hadn't wanted me to read it I wouldn't have finished it, and wouldn't have missed much. Tartt is clearly out of touch with the modern world, so trying to write a novel about a young boy growing up in the modern world was a disaster of trying to find excuses for why he didn't have a phone, didn't have a facebook, etc., so that her plot would work. In addition, her New York City didn't ring true to me at all, which as a New Yorker myself is a pretty grave sin. And finally, I wasn't engaged in her descriptions of art at all, even though the book was supposedly about the power of art. An underwhelming literary novel with nothing much new to say. If you want to read a good literary novel about art, read _Leaving Atocha Station_'s first chapter.

* _Eifelheim_ by Micheal Fynn. A great premise: an advanced alien ship crash-lands in medieval Europe and the surviving insectoid aliens are converted to Christianity and integrated into a nearby village. However, it was marred by an incredibly long and boring second act that just didn't seem to go anywhere. I ended up giving up and didn't finish it.

* _Neptune's Brood_ by Charles Stross. In theory I should love this novel (economics in space!), but I just can't get into it at all. Sadly this isn't the first Stross novel that this is true of (although I loved _Accellerando_). 

Non-fiction books that I read:

* _Better than Before_. How to change your habits. OK, but too focused on the author's own personal anecdotes instead of on any sort of theory or science. Her practical framework isn't very practical.

* _Interaction Ritual Chains_. A super-dense sociology book that I've been slowly making my way through. Totally love it. Focus on how our rituals with other people actually defines our identities much more than our individual psychology does. Lays out practical outcomes given these conclusions. Would recommend it to anyone interested in philosophy of mind, product or graphic design, or becoming a cult leader.

* _In the Dust of This Planet_. A philosophy of horror. Less interesting than I was hoping for, didn't get very far.

* _Finite and Infinite Games_. Not actually about games, but more of a short philosophy novel about methods of interaction with other people. Finite games are games (aka, interaction mods) that the goal is to end in some way (aka, win a football match). Infinite Games and games where the goal is that they never end (aka, running a successful football team or other business). Lots of stuff follows. Fun quick read.

* _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_. The collected talks of the founder of the lineage of Buddhism that I practice under. Really great instructions on how to meditate and bring the practice into other parts of your life. 

OK, that's all I remember. I'm sure I read more than just this, but nothing that really stuck with me apparently.",2016-01-06 16:10:44+00:00,cyo4p6e,1.0,t3_3z0pam,439028.0,printSF
1163,"She'll probably love China Miéville. Similar genre and feel to Neil Gaiman, strong female characters in all his novels, and they're just beautifully written. I'd recommend starting her with _The Scar_ or maybe _Un Lun Dun_, or his recent short story collection, _Three Moments of an Explosion_. 

You could get her the complete set of the Sandman comics (written by Gaiman) because holy shit, those are the best comics even written. It's expensive, but it's Gaiman's best writing and the art is incredible. 

For something almost as good is the web comic [Stand Still, Stay Silent](http://www.sssscomic.com/). It's beautifully written and illustrated. I think it strikes a good balance between scary and fantastical in the way that Gaiman can. 

---

For some non-Gaiman-related recs, I'd go with:

_Bear Daughter_ by Judith Berman. It's a fantasy _bildungsroman_ set in a Native American -inspired world with a 12 year old girl as a main protagonist. It's also one of my favorite books that I read last year. It's out of print but you can pick it up cheap [used on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Bear-Daughter-Judith-Berman/dp/B000H2N8KK) no problem. 

_The Bone Clocks_ by David Mitchell might work for her, or might be a bit dense (it would have been for me at that age, but not for other people). The first chapter follows a young girl as she runs away from home, and the rest of the novel is told from the perspective of other people as their lives cross with hers. Mitchell is a phenomenal writer, and the story starts off fairly contemporary, but becomes more and more fantastical as it moves into the future.

A book that I found completely mind-blowing at her age was _The Martian Chronicles_ by Ray Bradbury. It was incredibly dated even then, but it doesn't matter. His stories shine through as timeless.

A lot of Iain M. Banks' Culture novels end up being about the politics of a post-scarcity anarchic space empire. _Excession_, _Look to Windward_, and _Surface Detail_ in particular are strong in this regard.

_Dune_ is a classic ""politics in space"" book, maybe the quintessential one even. 

The final third of _The Mote in God's Eye_ by Niven and Pournell is all about the politics of [mild spoiler?](/s ""accepting the first alien race into the human empire""). A lot of people don't like that part of the book after the action/adventure of the first two thirds, but it was my favorite.

_The Fall of Hyperion_ involves a lot of politics with several different competing factions. There's the human society you've been with throughout the whole of _Hyperion_ (which also has its own important internal politics), there are the AIs who are supposedly in an alliance with them, there are the post-humans who are at war with the humans, and then there is another mysterious faction whose only contact with everyone else is through a time-traveling super-robot which a lot of the humans treat as a sort of god.

I would shy away from Hamilton. His books are overly long and don't really come to great conclusions. Based on your preferences I don't think you'd like it.

Zelazny has a stand-alone called _Lord of Light_ that is a tonne of fun. I'd go for that before doing the Amber series, since Amber is so long and kind of hit or miss, while _LoL_ is great all the way through.

Someone else mentioned Neal Stephenson, and I agree. _Anathem_, _Cryptonomicon_, or _Seveneves_ (but really, read _Anathem_).

1192,"Space travel is expensive.

There are a lot of reasons for this. Rocket fuel isn't exactly cheap, for instance.

But one of the biggest reasons is that rockets can only be used once.

Think about it. You have this giant, precision-manufactured rocket. It can withstand all sorts of forces of launch. Parts of it are thousands of degrees Kelvin, and other parts are only a couple 10 degrees Kelvin. It has a bunch of electronics and computers on board. It's really one of the most impressive physical machines that humans make, because it has to be _perfect_. One tiny little imperfection and the whole thing just explodes (and if there are people on board, everyone dies).

These things are phenomenally expensive. And they can only be used once. They go up, release their payload, then just drop back down to Earth.

Imagine if every time you flew on an airplane, the entire 747 was just tipped into the ocean after you debarked at your destination. Plane tickets would cost millions of dollars each. That's what space travel is like now.

Or, rather, that's what spaceflight _was_ like, until today. 

---

SpaceX decided ""hey, if this is what's so expensive, let's try to re-use our rockets"". To do that, they have to pilot the rocket back down and land it upright. 

They had tried it twice before, and the rockets almost made it back, but then tipped over and exploded. Kind of a bummer, but this is a very hard task that has never even been attempted before.

But then in June, the third SpaceX rocket that was supposed to land upright didn't even get to orbit. It exploded in launch. This was an ISS resupply mission, and was the first time that a SpaceX rocket had malfunctioned since they began offering commercial flights. 

This was a pretty big set-back for the company. So they took 6 months off, went back to the drawing board, and worked on improving their rockets so it wouldn't happen again.

Today was their first launch since the failure. It was a satellite launch. Someone paid them to put 11 satellites up ins pace. And they were attempting the rocket landing.

They totally nailed it. Rocket went up, the second stage made it into orbit and released 11 satellites, and the first stage came back down and landed gently only a couple thousand yards from where it had taken off. 

---

For those of us who care about space travel and rocketry, this is the biggest innovation in space flight since the Space Shuttle. The single biggest cost of space travel is about to be slashed. Orbital rocket flights are going to go from costing 100s of millions of dollars to costing a couple million or even less. Which means that it's going to be economically feasible to do a bunch of things in space that up until now we've only dreamed about. Tourism is just the start. Satellites become much cheaper to launch. Space mining becomes a possibility.

Space pretty much opens up to humanity again.",2015-12-22 05:26:53+00:00,cy7hj5t,1.0,t3_3xs6bj,11411.0,OutOfTheLoop

1225,"I grew up in rural Alaska. My dad was a bit of an alcoholic, and spent most his time working or at bars. That was better than him being home, since when he was home my parents would have fights that would often involve barricading doors with book shelves and making. My mom was highly religious, and held me out of elementary school to home-school me. Her idea of that was to stick me in a room alone with christian text books that said the world was created 6000 years ago, that the dinosaurs died because of the Great Flood and that plate tectonics aren't real.

I didn't have kids my age to socialize with. I lived in a cabin in the woods without running water or glass windows. (People don't realize that poverty isn't just about not having money, but about not having what many people would consider just basic aspects of life, like toilets and showers.) And yet I was a smart kid, living in a time when the internet was just becoming a thing. And I had access to a local library, which always hosted kid-friendly events in the summers which my mom would enroll me in as a part of ""home school"", where I most read whatever I wanted.

So I grew up reading. Reading a lot. I gravitated towards adventure fiction because I was a young boy, and eventually to science fiction because I _lived_ the life described in _Robinson Crusoe_ on a daily basis, but the lives in _I, Robot_ or _The Martian Chronicles_ were unlike anything I could imagine. My dad had been into SF as a kid too, and pointed me to some of the great works in the genre.


When I finally got sent to school in middle school, life was still hard. I was one of the poorest kids in the class. I didn't have friends, and didn't know how to make friends because I hadn't socialized with people my own age. The best thing I had going for me was that I'd gotten really good at reading and teaching myself things, so I did very well in the academic side of school.

Eventually middle school became high school, and things got better. I had friends, I did things, but I still read scifi since most the friends I'd made were also the nerdy kids who did. 

Then I went to college. I got into an ivy league school. I reinvented myself. I made a lot of friends who are still close to this day. I studied computer science, psychology, linguistics. I took literature courses. I studied abroad. I traveled. 

I live and work in New York City now. I am the founder of a startup which builds online engineering courses. I have a nice apartment. My roommate is a great friend of mine from school. I have a beautiful girlfriend. 

I still read SF. I love it. To me, nothing better represents a literature of wanting a better world, of striving to make that better world happen. I also read and love a lot of literary fiction, and non-fiction, but to me no reading is more fun that sitting down with a book full of big ideas and reading about the people who populate this strange new world.",2015-12-14 19:44:38+00:00,cxyz878,1.0,t3_3wtexl,3796.0,printSF

1232,"From James Raggi's website:

&gt; **What is so ""weird"" about LotFP?**

&gt;The rules themselves are mostly familiar and normal. You don't read the rulebook and think, ""Oh, that's strange!"" Well, maybe in a few places. Anything in the actual rulebook becomes in effect normal and not weird while playing the game. The idea is that the characters are normal (for values of ""normal"" that may or may not be present in a fantasy RPG setting), and it's what they encounter during play that is unusual and strange and where the weird is found.

&gt;So in practical terms, the weirdness lies in the adventures and support material, and consists of challenges to both the characters' and players' perception of what is supposed to be happening in the game.

&gt; You'll just have to deal with the fact that the rulebook is ""only"" a solid interpretation of classic RPG rules, with application left up to your own imagination.

That said, some of the rule decisions definitely help make LotFP better for Weird Fantasy than, say, 4e. In particular, the XP-for-money rule, and the insistence on keeping track of items + better encumbrance rules.

1265,"&gt; People can't seem to understand that choice and story are mutually exclusive

OK, this just isn't true at the level that /u/Soycrates is talking about.

The old Choose Your Own Adventure™ books gave the player/reader more agency than the Telltale games do, while still having a story. Hell, people make fun of it but in Depression Quest, the selections you make absolutely affect not only the story, but the gameplay that is available to you as you move through the story. It's a lot more dynamic than anything that I've played from Telltale. 

Now, I recognize that building all the assets you need to tell this kind of interactive story is a lot _harder_ when you begin to incorporate voice, 3d models, animations, etc etc etc, instead of just text. 

But to present it as a logical distinction between story and choice is just absolutely not true.

1269,"If I hear what you're saying, it's not necessarily the ""grimdark"" thing that you're going for, but rather something that takes a more varried look on morality and point of view than simply presenting modern Western morals as the good guys?

The War Against the Chtorr series by David Gerrold is a classic of this genre. Humans are not sitting pretty in a very hostile universe where Earth is under ecological attack. It's great, too. There's a lot of interesting morality questions, and the alien antagonists are pretty much 100% amoral in that they're intelligent, but not conscious—it's an ecology, not a race.

Watts' Rifter novels are really good too, if you liked _Blindsight_. In certain ways they might be more what you're looking for than _Blindsight_ was.

Robert Sheckley was a master of the short story format for doing this. A number of his stories are told from the POV of an alien race during first contact with humans. It's a great way of making the alien POV seem normal and us seem totally alien by contrast. I'd recommend the story collection _Store of the Worlds_, which was published a few years ago. His stories do not read like they were written in the 50s, they feel _much_ more modern than his contemporaries.

Michel Faber's _The Book of Strange New Things_ might or might not be up your alley. It tells the tale of an Evangelical Christian preacher who goes to a new planet to proselytize to the natives there. Without giving too much away, the reactions of the natives and the _reasons_ for those reactions are very much not what you or the narrator expect. It's a really cool book, probably my favorite SF book I read last year.

_Dark Eden_ by Chris Beckett tells the story of a group of humans stranded on a dark, far away planet for generations. They form a small tribal polity that has some very strange sense of morality, stealing both from Judeo-Christian values, the practical needs of living in a small community, and a sort of legend/mythology about when Earth is going to come back to save them.

From the review:

&gt; The Kefahuchi Tract is a naked singularity, an affront to physical laws hanging in the sky, an ultimate attractor for civilisations over geological ages of time. It is surrounded by the halo of lights and it is all... biggish, shall we say. Most easily graspable in bits.

&gt; The Tract ""streams across half the sky, trailing its vast invisible plumes of dark matter"". On its ragged margins is the Beach, where ""the corroded old prehuman observatories wove their chaotic orbits, tool platforms and laboratories abandoned millions of years previously by entities who had no idea where they were - or perhaps anymore what they were. They had all wanted a closer look at the Tract. Some of them had steered whole planets into position, then wandered off.""",2015-12-03 17:11:03+00:00,cxltong,1.0,t3_3van7m,2720.0,SF_Book_Club

In a lot of ways, _Dark Eden_ seems to be about the ways events get turned into stories, then legends, then myths, and how the powers that be use these myths to control people. While Family didn't have a religion in the ""worship God"" sense, their beliefs around Earth definitely had a religious quality to them, with bits and pieces of Judeo-Christian stories added in. And that's not to even mention the whole ""Eden"" thing.

Meanwhile, Jeff is clearly an embodiment of Buddhism. ""We are really here"" and a lot of the rest of his mantras all focus on mindfulness, and in the first pages of _Mother of Eden_ it becomes clear that he's introduced mindfulness meditation to his offspring and followers.

So I don't have a specific question other than that I'd love to hear you talk a bit about how you think about religion as a sociological phenomenon in your SF.

* _Dark Eden_ by Chris Beckett is our r/SF_Book_Club selection this month. I loved it. It's the story of a small tribe of humans descended from a crash landed starship who live on a world without a sun, where energy comes from the core pumped up by the strange ecology of the planet. The story itself is one of tribal politics, as it follows a group that questions the status quo and ends up drastically changing the lives of everyone in the tribe, not necessarily for the better. While the plot wasn't that innovative, I loved the world building and the characters. 

   Chris has been kind enough to agree to come by SFBC tomorrow so looking forward to that. 

* _The Forest_ by Justin Groot. This was a book that was actually written on reddit. I saw it in r/all and thought it sounded interesting. The premise is that the world is covered in forests instead of oceans, forests that have some strange stuff going on. The book wasn't great, merely an OK first novel. The narrative follows explorers of the forests, and is exactly the kind of ""hard men working for and against a shadowy government agency"" conceit that you'd expect. Pretty much it's Vandeermer's _Annihiliation_ but not as good. Particularly galling was the protagonist, who reads like a nerdy ""nice guy"" (he actually gets friend zoned, bleh), not the bad ass special forces dude he's supposed to be.

    That said I actually read the whole book. It was compellingly written, the action was solid, and there was something about how earnest it was that made me push through all the stuff I didn't like. I'll probably be keeping my eye on Groot, it's not impossible that he'll grow into a great writer. ",2015-12-01 19:57:42+00:00,cxjh59w,1.0,t3_3uzlx9,28315.0,printSF

1324,"_Lord of Light_ by Roger Zelazny is a great read. It's a Buddhist science fiction story where death and rebirth play a really large role. 

_Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom_ by Cory Doctorow examines the fear of death that comes about when a person's digital brain backup becomes corrupted. 

_Blindsight_ by Peter Watts is a more existential look at who we are and whether consciousness is what we think it is. 

The Bagavad Gita is an ancient Indian text about a warrior confronted with an aspect of the Hindu god of death and rebirth as he is questioning his duty to slaughter his cousins in battle. Most people think of it as a holy text, I think of it more as ancient science fiction. 

_Hell's Demon_ by Wayne Barlowe is a fantasy novel about a demon is hell who wants to fight against Lucifer and get back in the good graces of God. Barlowe is a visual artist who was inspired to write the novel after illustrating Dante's _Inferno_. It's surprisingly excellent for a first novel.

1337,"Stuff. I always carried a pocket knife. A lot of building fires—making kindling, shaving larger logs to get them to light better, shaving magnesium and creating sparks to light it, that kind of thing. I lived near the coast and it wasn't uncommon to just meet up with people on the beach and build a fire just because. Breaking down boxes at my job. Poking around my truck engine while it was still hot to try to figure out why it wasn't running well. Prying stuff that was stuck. Sometimes you'd get a nasty greenwood splinter that would get infected and fester if you didn't cut it out. Sometimes you'd buy something and would need a knife to get it out of that shitty shrinkwrap.

I also carried a machete in my truck so that if I went hiking and needed to cut through any brush I could (trails were often pretty poorly maintained, mostly by people like me who were just using them). Or to chop down small trees and branches for the fire starting thing. 

When you were hiking/camping/rafting/boating/etc, it's good to have a larger knife/multitool on you in case you get into some sort of survival situation. You'd also want a knife on you when you were fishing, in case you had to cut your line or remove a hook from a fish using the pliers. 

A knife is a tool (and usually I had both a pocket knife on me as well as some sort of leatherman or other multitool in my truck). It was used as such, whenever it came in handy to have a couple inches of sharp metal protruding out of my hand, or a set up pliers, or a screwdriver, or metal file, or etc etc etc. 

I never used it to hurt anyone or anything (except for fish) if that's what your asking. That was never the point. A knife isn't exactly a good self-defense tool. ",2015-11-16 19:03:10+00:00,cx2ck3z,4.0,t1_cx26jl4,9080.0,SubredditDrama

You seem awfully sure about other people's inner lives and the way they express them.

1. I aggressively quit reading books. I've quit books 20 pages to the end because I don't care any more, and I'll happily quit a book 20 or 100 or 400 pages into it. Once I am getting less fun out of continuing than I would from reading another book, I stop reading it.

  To me this is one of the biggest things. It means that I can pick up books and put them down with very little effort. I can decide whether I am actually enjoying a book, and I never have to feel guilty because I don't. It means I can get through my to-read list a lot faster, because I won't actually end up reading all the books, only the ones that actually caught my attention.

  I had to actively train myself to be willing to put down a book I wasn't enjoying, but once I did I ended up getting a lot more out of reading for pleasure.

2. I make a point of reading a lot. I read on my commute, I read before bed, and I try to remind myself to read instead of fucking around on the internet or playing video games when I'm just ""bored"".  In those cases, I force myself to pick up one of my unread books and give it a try.

3. I read multiple books at a time. This way when I'm not in the mood for one, I'll likely be in the mood for another. This was actually a pretty natural out-growth of (1). Once I started being willing to put down books and start another, I found that I'd come back to some of those books that I put down later, just naturally.

Here's the thing. You said ""gravitational distortion is lensing.""

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies gravity, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls distortion lensing. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""lensing-like activity"" you're referring to the general fact of the curvature of space-time caused by gravity, which includes things from distortion to warping to lensing.

So your reasoning for calling distortion a lens is because random people ""call any gravitational effects lensing?"" Let's get acceleration and weight in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. Distortion is distortion and a lensing artifact. But that's not what you said. You said this is a lens, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all effects of gravity a lens, which means you'd call acceleration, warping, and orbits lensing, too. Which you said you don't.

Listen, by the OP's own self-serving description, all of the players were upset about what he'd done. I'm trying to explain _why_ they were upset. It's simple: they trusted him in a position of authority, and he abused that authority and their trust for his own entertainment. Yes, it's a small thing and a small amount of authority, and that's why he's probably not losing any friends over the situation. 

However, he gave them no way to figure it out, no way to win the game. They thought they were playing against each other, and instead they were playing against him, but _he was the only one who knew that_. 

I think the problem player was technically right: since there were no werewolves, the villagers should have just won. Of course, that doesn't make for a fun game, so here's another variant: What he should have done was to not kill players off. There were no werewolves, so there should have been no deaths except those caused by the players. And if they'd all voted ""we don't kill anyone because there are no werewolves"", they would have won the game against him. That would have been great. 

Instead, he did everything he could to make sure they went at each other's throats and then got defensive when they figured it out and rightly were upset.

I disagree that things would continue as normal, however. The announcement to the N.

1412,"Hi Becky, time for a few of my own questions:

I think it's fair to say that the book has an explicit political stance. This seems to often be true of good SF, that it is using the strange to make a political point about the familiar. Why do you think SF is so effective at doing this?

What is your own personal history with SF? Why do you enjoy writing it?

Have you written fiction in forms outside of novels/stories? Any interest in doing video games, interactive fiction, etc?

_Long Way_ was very much a road trip novel, much more focused on the personal lives of the characters and their trip than the over-arching plot. You've mentioned that you'd like to write more in this same universe, do you think you'd focus more on the plot for that?

Finally, your novel seems to advocate for tolerance broadly. However, the one place this didn't seem true was in tolerance for Ohan's religious convictions that he was meant to die. In fact, religion seemed to be mostly absent from the novel. Personally, I'm always fascinated by the way religion is handled in science fiction, as well as perplexed by the fact that more SF doesn't attempt to grapple with what seems like such a fundamental piece of the human condition (which I say as more-or-less an athiest). Was this a conscious decision not to include more religiosity?",2015-10-28 18:19:48+00:00,cwg5n9y,1.0,t3_3qkuuw,6509.0,SF_Book_Club

You usually have to do some good promotion yourself, and once it starts to get shared Medium makes it more likely to go viral than a random wordpress blog. But you have to do that first kick of sharing yourself.

If you are legit writing a well-researched article on this, I'd be surprised if a site like BoingBoing or Vox or Gawker wouldn't pick it up. You'll have to go through their submissions process, which can be a little arcane. Your best bet is probably to reach out to authors who have written about similar stuff, say ""Hey I have this piece written about X, would your editor be interested in it?"", and see if they get back. Twitter is great for this.

Beware that different media outlets have different tones they go for, so your piece might need some major re-writing depending on the outlet you go after. You might do well to write a few different versions of it so that you can shop the appropriate version to the right place.

If you PM me once it's finished I can put it in front of my friend who's an author at Vox. No idea if they actually take submissions but if it's written in their ""explainer"" tone they'd probably love it.

1426,"What are some ways that a liberal country might become more despotic?

1. The ruling class attempts to keep more and more power. (Venice after the Renaissance.)
2. Technology is used to spy on and mold the behavior of citizens. (PATRIOT ACT.)
3. Political revolution. (The communists revolt, and win.)
4. The people vote themselves out of office. (Nazi Germany.)
5. Empire building. An authoritarian country invades, rules the invaded country. (Napoleon in Europe.)
6. Puppet gov't / colonization. Another country, whether despotic or inclusive itself, sets up a new government in the country in question to serve the other country's desires. (Vichy France, or Pinochet's Chile.)
7. Economic collapse leads to new despotic rulers taking over. (No examples come to mind.)
8. Collapse of central government leads to despotic local ruler/warlords taking over. (Somalia.)
9. Ceases to exist. Global warming, nuclear war, etc., kills most the people / in a country. Maybe leads to 8, maybe everyone's just dead. (Fictionally depicted in _A Canticle for Leibowitz_.)
10. Civil war. Causes both crackdown on rights by ruling government, and areas where smaller gov't take over usually look like local warlords. (Mexican cartels or the Islamic State.)

So those are our methods. Most are not mutually exclusive, and in fact can cause runaway feedback loops.

Probably all of these would have to be taken into account to make a realistic scenario here. Think something like 

1. Economic collapse in the EU and anti-immigration pressures lead to lots of far-right states being established, to the point of democracy being suspending in some of those states. 

2. American democracy becomes a technofascist plutocracy where the wealthy control the populace through technology. 

3. SE Asia is wracked by nuclear war between Pakistan and India, central governments fall and local warlords fill the power vacuum.

4. A new Chinese government decides that expansion is necessary for continued economic growth, starts installing authoritarian puppet states in the rest of East Asia. Japan gets scared, starts a full-on war with China, loses b/c America is too focused inward and needs China as a trading partner.",2015-10-26 02:16:50+00:00,cwcxghy,1.0,t3_3q68so,30035.0,FutureWhatIf

Here's some books that helped with that feeling:

1. _Cloud Atlas_ by David Mitchell. A genre- and time-spanning book. It won't feel like SF when you start reading it, but I promise you it's worth sticking with. 

2. _Blindsight_ mentioned above.

3. _Hyperion_ and _Fall of Hyperion_ by Dan Simmons. Tells the tales of six travelers off to find a mysterious being called the Sheik, which is considered an angel of death in their far-future culture. The first book is a frame narrative around the six histories of the six travelers, the second book is the conclusion of the frame story and branches out into the politics of the world they live in.

  Don't read the _Endymon_ books though, those were awful.

4. The Sandman Comics by Neil Gaiman. Some of the best comics ever written, they're worthy of the title of actual goddamn literature. Probably the best thing Gaiman has ever done, and that's said as a big fan of his.

5. _The Left Hand of Darkness_ by Ursula K. Le Guin.

1455,"The thing that everyone is missing is that there is a deaf community because they all speak the same language.

ASL (American Sign Language) is not simply another form of English, like written English. It's its own fully functional language. It has a different vocabulary than English, and a completely different syntax (which is actually fascinating, because signed languages can do things that no spoken languages can do). 

It's not just ""ah we all have the same disability"", but ""ah we all speak the same language that most other people don't"". It's a lot like larger cities which have immigrant communities: back in their own country they would not necessarily ever cross paths, but in the new city they're brought together by a common tongue. 

The reason members of the deaf community get touchy about this kind of thing is because there is a centuries-long history of people calling them ""deaf and dumb"" as if sign language isn't a real language, and even brutally beating children in deaf schools who tried to learn it. They are not merely paranoid when they think everyone is out to get them, as for decades and decades that has been the case, and it's only in the last 20-30 years that American school systems have begun to accept and foster the learning of ASL by deaf children.

One of the major worries about Cochlear Implants is that hearing children are less likely to acquire ASL to the degree that their parents and deaf peers do. They have the potential of being alienated from the community by the simple fact that they won't speak the same language as that community. That's a terrifying prospect for any parent, to know that their children might not be able to fully communicate with them. 

I really believe that if people knew more about what ""deaf community"" really means, and its history in the US, that we'd have a lot more empathy for deaf parents in this situation. This isn't ancient history, this is stuff that may well have happened to the parents in question, and _definitely_ happened to their parents if they were deaf. They should not be vilified as monsters who want their children to lead a sub-par life. They honestly believe, with good evidence, that giving their children a sub-par form of hearing will itself be restricting them from engagement in their family and larger community.",2015-10-20 11:55:25+00:00,cw69pqc,2.0,t1_cw5piz6,46957.0,SubredditDrama

1458,"It's really not that simple.

Just because ""dumb"" was the primary term meaning ""unable to speak"" doesn't mean it was a nice word, any more than ""idiot"" or ""retarded"" were nice words when they were the primary words used to refer to a group of people.

In addition, ""dumb"" didn't simply mean ""unable to speak"". It had connotations that the referent was developmentally challenged in a way that made it impossible to speak. So in that way it's a lot closer to words like ""retarded"" or ""cretin"" which were sure the scientific words for a thing, but were still really mean and offensive.

This is made even worse by the fact that deaf people are _not_ developmentally challenged. They can learn language just fine. In fact, if you put a bunch of deaf kids together they will spontaneously create their own fully-featured language. The only reason ""deaf and dumb"" tend to come together as a package is because hearing people didn't recognize deaf speech as speech. In fact, until rather recently, in most deaf schools children were beaten when they were caught signing. 

So you have a population of people who are just as able to learn to speak as any other, but whose speech is not recognized as such by the dominant population, and who are savagely forced not to speak, and then who are called ""dumb"" by the dominant population because they don't learn to speak under the conditions that population specifically built in order such that they wouldn't learn to speak.

1463,"Well of course it is. But that doesn't mean that you can't have that preference.

Transphobia, homophobia, sexism, racism—these are all things that we all have inside of us. Being told ""that was racist"" or ""you're being transphobic"" is not a world-ending bad thing. It doesn't reflect on who you, as an individual, are. It means that you performed an action or had a thought that was hurtful to other people just because of who they are. That's OK, that's not your fault. As long as you recognize what you did and strive not to feed those feelings, you're doing good.

As empathetic human beings, we should strive not to act in ways that hurt other people. Our reaction to ""that was racist"" should _not_ be ""but I'm not a racist!"". Those are two different concepts—performing racist actions vs. being a racist. I totally believe you that you're not a transphobe, but that doesn't mean that you don't have internalized transphobia. Everyone does. Just like we all have internalized racism, and internalized sexism. We've been brought up in a culture that privileges certain groups over others, so _of course_ we're going to have internalized a preference towards those groups and away from the unprivileged groups. 

Our reaction when presented with that fact should be ""OK, so how do I minimize the hurtful impact this has on individuals within those groups.""

1476,"In PnP RGPs, a good wound system (for me, as a GM) does several things:

**It allows for more player choice while enforcing consequences for those choices**. You want to jump into melee combat poorly armed and armored? You want to jump off a building with an umbrella as a parachute? You want to jump into the river to grapple with the shark while wearing plate armor? Be my guest, but even if you get out of it alive, you're not going to be a happy camper.

Player agency is one of the most important parts of a good RPG in my opinion, and various HP/wound systems when done right actually _increase_ player agency by giving me as GM more tools to deal with whatever antics they want to pull. However, for this to work the consequences of any given action within the wound/HP system should be somewhat predictable by the players.

**It adds to character customization and role-play potential**. This is often over-looked, but long-term consequences to wounds should not _simply_ be negative attributes. They should tell the story in some way. Maybe you're -1 to strength (boring), or maybe your wrist is permanently bent to the right and anything that requires that hand is at -1 to accomplish (way better). 

The trick here is that good wounds aren't just stats, they're a visible, role-playable, real-world consequence to that character that just happens to have an effect on the stats. And let me tell you, when a character loses an eye and has a nasty scar on their face due to a battle they almost died in, a good player is going to be _glad_ about those consequences because it makes their character unique.

**In-battle feedback**. Players should know about how well the battle is going for them based on how injured they are vs. how injured their opponents are. Wounds are that feedback. Each party and player is going to have a different threshold of ""oh shit, time to run away"", but wounds/hp should always be giving them feedback that they can used to make that decision.

**It's well-balanced**. Avoid the spiral of death while having real consequences. The spiral of death is when your defense and offense are tied to your HP, so each wound you take makes you less good at defending or killing things—then battle becomes a game of ""who gets the first hit or two in"", which I find very much not fun. At the same time, if HP/wounds don't have very real consequences to them, then they won't be taken seriously.

**Not too hard to deal with at the table**. Really, it shouldn't add much time to battle turns especially. This is part of why HP has lasted so long, and why even other story-game wound systems are really just HP in disguise (FATE, I'm looking at you). 

Personally, I use a combination of HP and random long-term wound effect tables that get rolled on either during really consequential battle moments, or after the battle is over and the wounded are being healed.",2015-10-15 17:14:27+00:00,cw0twr3,1.0,t3_3ouzbn,10205.0,gamedesign

1492,"Comparing closeness of percentiles when you're trying to pin down what ""rich"" means is incredibly misleading. Each percentile you move means making _a lot_ more money. To be in the top 1% of income earners in this country, your household needs to make $400k a year. That's 7x more money than someone who makes $60k a year. It means you have to double a $60k salary three times! It's not even close. 

$60k is not rich, in fact it's far from it. It's a blue-collar salary, that of construction worker or municipal garbage collector. Meanwhile, making $400k means that you are almost definitely a millionaire.

A $60k income puts you in the top 45% of households in the US.  Sure, a single person who makes $60k might be in the top 10% of other single people with no kids, but that is a terrible measure of how they stack up against other earners generally, which is what the whole ""1%"" thing is supposed to measure. Single people without kids skew young, and young people don't make as much money as older people.

  * _Ender's Game_ (yes, Ender is the main character, no, the book isn't all about him)
  * _Startide Rising_ by David Brin features a cast of humans, dolphins, and chimps crash-landed on a planet, trying to get off of it, while angry aliens search for them in that solar system. Great book.

* Neal Stephenson's novels usually have a decent cast of characters. _Anathem_ is probably his best and most RPG-like. The Baroque Cycle is the most fantasy-ish. _Cryptonomicon_ is gold. _Snow Crash_ was written originally as a computer RPG and is a lot of fun. All include a large cast who work together using different skills to solve problems.

* _Blindsight_ by Peter Watts features a crew of post-humans alone on a ship in the Oort Cloud, making first contact with an intelligence far more alien and smart than they're prepared for. One of my favorite novels ever, and again the cast of characters is hugely important to the novel.

* _Soon I Will Be Invincible_ by Austin Grossman features a superhero team and the politics and intrigue that goes on amongst them. Really great.

* _Soft Apocalypse_ by Will McIntosh features a nomadic group of former middle-class people as the wander a post-apocalyptic US that has been ravaged by economic inequality and famine.

1522,"Personally, I see no value in a masters unless there are specific jobs that you're after that you cannot do without the degree. You'll spend two years either blowing through savings or accruing debt while not making any money. You'll come out with two years less professional experience than your peers who didn't get a masters. And it's no joke to say that advanced degrees can hurt you during the job search, although that applies more to Ph. D.s than to masters. 

If you're going with specific goals in mind and with a clear plan of what getting the masters gets you _after_ the masters, then by all means do it. But if you're going because you don't know what else you want to do with your life and more school sounds good, run away. You'll be much better off taking shit jobs where you can learn on the job for the next two years and come out of it in a place you want to be. If you need to, take night classes or do a program like General Assembly or Iron Yard or an executive MBA. 

The way you have to think about getting an advanced degree is totally different from the way you think about college. A 4-year degree is a pretty much mandatory piece of paper to get into any middle-class jobs in America, and 80% of those jobs don't give a shit what you actually studied. A masters, if it's not relevant to the jobs you're looking into, will actively hurt you in more ways than one.",2015-10-05 13:29:22+00:00,cvovfiv,3.0,t1_cvopq4i,21512.0,linguistics
1523,"Linguistics is awesome and fun. Definitely take a course or two your freshman year to get a sense of whether it's something you'd be into studying more. But take as broad a set of courses as you possibly can. What you like and don't like will change over time, and might surprise you.

At my university, we needed 32 classes to graduate, and a BA in linguistics was about 13 classes including prereqs and the language requirement. That left me 19 other classes to study other things. I took a number of computer science courses, a couple of courses in graphic design, a few literature courses, and a bunch of courses in psych, neuroscience, cogsci, anthropology, and other (social) sciences. 

The only courses whose specific skills I use every day are the CS and design courses. I work in education technology as a product manager, and I will forever be glad that I started off school as a CS major, but did not end up there. However, the ability to think clearly and analytically about open-ended problems was something that all my courses helped with, but my high-level Linguistics courses really hammered home. 

I'm never going to need to draw syntax trees in the real world, but being able to do those well and on the fly has happened, in my case, to translate to doing product design well and on the fly. Writing 20 page papers on the minutia of the syntax of languages that I don't speak translated into being able to look at hard problems outside of my specific domain, and work with other experts in that domain to come up to solutions to the problems. 

At the end of the day, whatever you major in is what you make of it. The school, the other classes you take, the student groups you join, the internships you have, the student jobs you take, all will have just as much of an effect on you. I learned more about how to actually _perform_ the scientific process in my computer technician student job than I did in any of my lecture-heavy science classes. 

This is rambling b/c I don't really have time to make it shorter, but hopefully you'll take something away from it. Go to a good school, learn some technical skills, take a wide range of courses that include both humanities and sciences, and major in something that's rigorous and interesting, hang out with other interesting people, and you'll do fine.",2015-10-05 02:38:12+00:00,cvoin54,1.0,t3_3nhc8s,27507.0,linguistics

Also, the two-vote effect will only be noticeable after you refresh the page. So for instance:

2. I open the thread and see _The Caves of Steel_. It has +1 points right now, which I can see because I am a mod.

3. I decide I like the book, and would be happy to read it. I hit the upvote button. The book now has +2 points.

4. I refresh the page to see if anyone else has submitted a book. No one has, but behold! _The Caves of Steel_ is now at +3 points. 

5. That was fast, so I'm suspicious. I decide to remove my upvote. Huh, it is now at +2 points.

5. But I refresh, and it's back to +1 point. 

I can do this back and forth and back and forth. It's clearly not vote fuzzing, because it happens far too consistently and at vote counts that are too small for vote fuzzing to occur as frequently as this does.

I get it, you can program and you've submitted a few RPs to the reddit code base, so you feel some ownership over all this. But you're not actually listening to anything I'm saying, or asking very good questions if you'd like to understand what's going on.

If you really don't believe me, check out the reddit code base. There are several references to contest_mode_upvotes_only in the model. Now, I have never used python (and haven't programmed in 8 years) so I can't parse out what's going on. Here's some of the relevant code:

    # in contest mode, use only upvotes for the score if the subreddit
    # has been (manually) set to do so
    if (item.link.contest_mode and
        item.subreddit.contest_mode_upvotes_only and
        not item.score_hidden):
      item.score = item._ups
      item.voting_score = [
        item.score - 1, item.score, item.score + 1]
      item.collapsed = False

You can use GitHub's search in repo functionality to find the rest.

If you'd like to just file a bug report for this, the facts are pretty simple:

1. When in contest_mode_upvotes_only, mod upvotes count for 2x.
2. When in contest_mode_upvotes_only, downvotes are re-applied when taken out of contest mode.

It's debatable whether (2) is a bug, a feature, or neither. Regardless,  in my experience it's a bad UX decision, because of the reasons I've already given.

&gt; Aerial combat brings a thrilling new dimension to the Napoleonic Wars as valiant warriors rise to Britain’s defense by taking to the skies . . . not aboard aircraft but atop the mighty backs of fighting dragons.

&gt; When HMS Reliant captures a French frigate and seizes its precious cargo, an unhatched dragon egg, fate sweeps Capt. Will Laurence from his seafaring life into an uncertain future–and an unexpected kinship with a most extraordinary creature. Thrust into the rarified world of the Aerial Corps as master of the dragon Temeraire, he will face a crash course in the daring tactics of airborne battle. For as France’s own dragon-borne forces rally to breach British soil in Bonaparte’s boldest gambit, Laurence and Temeraire must soar into their own baptism of fire.

1562,"[_Bear Daughter_](http://www.amazon.com/Bear-Daughter-Judith-Berman/dp/B000H2N8KK) by Judith Berman

&gt; Based on Pacific Northwest Native Americans oral literature, Berman's touching fantasy chronicles the journey of Cloud, who at the novel's start awakens one morning as a 12-year-old human girl, when the night before she had been a bear cub. Taking human shape is a disturbing and difficult conversion for her, and the book's young adult audience will relate to her disorientation and awkwardness, an obvious metaphor for even your average adolescent struggle. Separated from her mother, and violently ostracized by her stepfather Rumble (the tribe's chief), Cloud strikes out on her own to seek her paternal heritage, gain self-understanding and come into her powers. Berman balances the story's mythology with convincing emotional subtext, including Cloud's desire to be accepted among her human family and the often ignoble attitudes of the human elders. With its sympathetic young heroine and density of action, this richly re-imagined folk tale may straddle young adult and adult audiences.

I enjoyed this novel for its interesting setting (a fantasy version of pre-Columbus Pacific Northwest), and a story that centers around the struggles a young girl goes through while on the hero's journey and how relationships to those around her help her on that journey, and change her.",2015-09-28 14:16:43+00:00,cvgvm74,1.0,t3_3mp0js,4878.0,SF_Book_Club

1569,"Here are some classic stories that should go well in high school. I'm aiming for stories that I think will lead to good discussion. Some of them are rather progressive stories, some are explicitly conservative, some don't have an agenda. 

* ""The Cold Equations"". When talking about the justification of his actions, make sure to talk through the implications of the story as it's presented, as well as the fact that some person chose to set up the story in [that particular way](https://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/sciencefiction15/tag/sorry-for-being-a-feminist-buzzkill/).

* The first story from _A Canticle for Leibowitz_ (which is a novel of three short stories) is great. About a monk after the apocalypse who finds a ""holy relic"", aka something from our time. Should spark some good discussions on the importance of religion in society and the nature of religion.

* Anything from _The Martian Chronicles_. Particularly, [""—And the Moon be Still and Bright"" and ""The Settlers""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_Chronicles#.E2.80.94And_the_Moon_Be_Still_as_Bright_.28June_2001.2F2032.29). 

* Ursula K. Le Guin's _The Left Hand of Darkness_ explores a society without gender which lives in a world of eternal winter. It's a short novel and if I could pick any novel for all high schoolers to read, it would be either this or _Canticle_ above.

* _At the Mountains of Madness_. This one is less for the discussions that it will create, and more because it's an awesome, terrifying story that inspired me more than any other when I was that age.

* My girlfriend's answer is _The Forever War_, which I still haven't read. She said it's short and a good read. Should lead to really good discussion about the horror of war, probably a good thing to contrast with the scifi first-person shooters your students probably play. 

I posted a thread a while back called [You're given the power to select one (SF) book for all high schoolers everywhere to read.

However, let's be clear on the context in which he's saying this: the early 80s, when social science was done very differently from how it's done today. 

We recognize now that social sciences can use the scientific method, but can also use other methods. This is OK, there are more ways of knowing things that just using the scientific method to find them out.

edit: It's also worth noting that he had very different things to say about the social sciences and humanities earlier in his career.

_The Mote in God's Eye_ has a really interesting social structure in the background, one that's more based on a feudal nobility than anything else. In addition, the book seems genuinely skeptical of too much innovation. 

_Book of the New Sun_. Wolfe is a Jew turned Catholic. Definitely a literary book. You could argue that Sevarian is a Kierkegaardian Knight of Faith, especially by the end of the book.

_Speaker for the Dead_ is about the power of small communities to come together and help each other, and the necessity of family.

_Brave New World_ is about the dangers of mass government-controlled entertainment.

This is a stupidly simple analysis. All I'm doing is taking any puppy-nominated works off the ballot, and substituting the next most popular works from the nomination procedure for them. All the data is taking from the official [Hugo Statistics pdf](http://www.thehugoawards.org/content/pdf/2015HugoStatistics.pdf). I'm listing them in order of the actual votes they got.

I'm just doing the thing here. I'll leave it up to others to figure out what it all means.

That's not necessarily true, though. Once the Puppy slates were out and public, all it takes is a large number of people independently deciding to vote ""no award"" for these numbers to show up.

It's the same problem with the original Puppy contention, which was that ""because so many people voted for novels with a liberal social message, it proves that liberals are working together to stack the votes"". That's one way of interpreting the data, but a much simpler way is that Worldcon voters skew liberal, or that they're politically neutral, and liberal writers have been writing better SF, or getting published by publishers who are better able to market the books, etc etc etc..

The point is that the data alone don't actually support the contention that you seem to be making, which is (as I understand it) that people coordinated _en masse_ to out-vote the Puppies.

5950 people cast votes in the Hugo awards this year, more than ever in history. Everyone's happy about it, but it must have been because of the Puppies controversy. Over 11,000 members of Worldcon this year, also the most ever. 

Gerrold is a pretty good presenter. I'd never guess he was in his 70s. 

""No award"" has only been given 5 times in the past.

Robert Silverberg is leading the room in chanting the Hare Krishna chant in order to calm everyone down. He's been the first to mention the tension surrounding this worldcon. He's also both a hilarious and effective speaker.

Fanzine thank-yous are going for a while.

The ""no award"" for Related Work got really loud applause. That was one of the awards with only sad/rabid puppy nominees. 

It looks like they're going a little out of order. Now there's a tribute to fans, artists, editors, and authors no longer with us.

Gerrold seems sincerely shaken by the last thing, particularly Leonard Nemoy's name.

Connie Willis is giving a speech about all the things that can go wrong in the Hugos. She's pretty funny. And going on and on and on. She just cracked Gerrold up by calling the Twightlight books the most literary novels she ever read. Now she's making fun of Bob Silverberg's Hare Krishna chant. And it came around to thanking the MCs. 

There are technical difficulties on their end, which is why things are out of order.

Day 1: Lamar Valley + Beartooth Highway, drive. Starting at Tower Junction, drive up the Lamar Valley and as far along the Beartooth as you can make it. Get out and stop frequently. Do some short mountain hikes. Hell, you can just walk in any direction from the overlooks and see some cool shit. Eventually once you've gone far enough, turn around and go back into the park. We spent one day doing this, and it was 100% worth it. 

Day 2: Picnic hike to specimen ridge. Wake up early, pack a lunch, and do the Picnic hike I linked above, and keep going as far along specimen ridge as you can. The best views of the Canyon are from here, not from the road. You also see the entire Lamar valley spread out in front of you. And there is a petrified forest. We had a herd of bison cross the trail in front of us at one point, it was incredible. Eat lunch on the ridge, continue hiking until you get tired. Hike back to the car. With the rest of your day, drive to your next campground/hotel, preferably somewhere nearer Lake Yellowstone.

Day 3: Thermal Features! You can do the whole loop and see all the thermal features in one day, so do that. They're going to be hella touristy and there will be people everywhere, but it will be worth it. Don't miss Old Faithful, that thing is ridiculous. Most worthwhile ""touristy"" attraction I've ever gone to. 

That will give you a really good taste of the different things the park has to offer. You'll definitely see wildlife, you'll see a lot of different geology (there's a lot that's unique even outside of the thermal features), and you'll get one longish hike and a bunch of little ones in. The only real thing you're missing is a longer backcountry hike, but with only three days if you do that, that's going to be a majority of your trip right there so you won't really get a cross-section of the park.

&gt; It’s a matter of truth in labeling. I like there to be some resemblance between what is promised on the outside and what you get on the inside, and if it says ""science fiction,"" I want there to be something that doesn’t already exist.

Is she engaging in the same old tired debate that Macleod is, about what is and isn't SF? Yes, she is, and it's kind of obnoxious for that reason. However, saying that she's said ""unkind things about SF as a genre and rejects the label"" is not only factually incorrect, but it's really over-identifying with what at the end of the day is a marketing term.

A complete theory of how we use ritual to create meaning, and thus how to design rituals to create the meanings you want.

_The Lever of Riches_, by Joel Mokyr. Especially in tech there is a lot of talk about ""innovation"", but few people really understand what the word means. This is a deep academic look at innovation from the Greeks to the present day. The overall questions are why and how do innovation happen?

The California Department of Consumer Affairs has a lot of different branches, and I know from experience that some of them will investigate pretty small businesses. The attitude they took in this case was more ""we want to help you comply so we can make the threat of a fine go away"", but that's one anecdote.

That said, I have another question for you: do you want this to be a side project in addition to working part-time and taking care of your baby? Or is this project going to be your part-time work?

1715,"_Look to Windward_, one of Iain M. Banks' Culture novels, doesn't feature any humans as main characters. It's also my favorite of the Culture novels because it's one of the most personal, a story of love and loss. There are also whole sections about life in a large gas nebula that are really cool. 

_The Integral Trees_ by Larry Niven is also set in a large floating gas nebula. It's a zero-g environment dominated by large tree-like plants. There are some humanoid creatures who live there, and the story is about them, but their culture and lifestyle is completely different because of their environment. Would definitely seek this one and its sequel, _The Smoke Ring_, out.

_Startide Rising_ has more non-human characters than human characters, but is definitely still about humans. There are point of view characters who are dolphins, chimps, and aliens though, and Brin writes alien POV chapters _so well_. I think some of the other novels in the Uplift War novels might be even less human-centric, but I don't know which they are.

_The Bees_ by Laline Pauli is a sort of SF/F story told from the point of view of a bee in a bee hive. Humans show up in two framing chapters, but the story isn't about them in any way, it's about the bees. Interesting novel, I enjoyed it as a quick read.

Some of Charlie Stross' far-future novels feature a 100% posthuman cast. _Neptune's Brood_ for instance. They still feel like humans though even though they're super-intelligent biological robots, so it might not be what you're after.

My own experience in college was recent. I graduated six years ago. I don't think I've ever read a description of university that has less to do with what I actually experienced there. No one was there ""to hear what confirms what they were already thinking"" instead of to learn new things. 

This is some weird straw man that has been built up in these articles, and it's so strange to me that people actually believe it. Especially people with no recent experience in the academy.

You're right that an education wasn't always at the top of the list of ""reasons to go to college"", but it wasn't as simple as getting a job, either. For better or for worse, college is a class marker now. One of the best ways to move up from one socio-economic class to another is to go to a college that acts as a gateway to a higher socio-economic class. 

I get really uncomfortable whenever people start talking about how fewer people should go to college, because I think it ignores what the real value of college in the US is—as a way for young people to be more mobile in socio-economic class than they otherwise would have the opportunity to be.

1755,"Copy/pasting an email I sent a buddy the other day:

Michael Norton is the name of the author of the studies I mentioned about gift-giving. He calls his work ""prosocial incentives"".

Here's the abstract from the paper:

&gt; Organizations depend on effective incentivization of employees to boost employee morale and improve performance. One common strategy is to offer monetary rewards (e.g., bonuses) that employees typically spend on themselves. Recent research suggests, however, that spending money on others has a greater positive emotional impact than spending on oneself; given that such prosocial behavior has been hypothesized to improve group functioning, we explore the impact of providing people with prosocial incentives – a novel type of bonus spent on others rather than on themselves. In Study 1, we show that prosocial incentives – in the form of donations to charity – lead to happier and more satisfied employees. In Study 2, we show that prosocial incentives – in the form of expenditures on teammates – lead to better performance in both sales teams and sports teams. These results suggest that simple adjustments to employee incentives can produce measurable benefits for both employees and organizations. 

Here's the paper itself (link is at the bottom): http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7260.html

Some of my favorites.

Octavia Butler, [_Blood Child_](http://www.amazon.com/Bloodchild-Other-Stories-Octavia-Butler/dp/1583226982/). This is a collection of short stories. Each story includes a short essay that Butler wrote about it, which are great little looks into the mind of the author. ""Speech Sounds"" especially stood out to me, a short story about people trying to connect with each other after an apocalypse has wiped out the human capacity for language.

Ken Liu, [The Paper Menangerie](http://io9.com/5958919/read-ken-lius-amazing-story-that-swept-the-hugo-nebula-and-world-fantasy-awards). Ken is Chinese-American, and this story is about a young man's grappling with his Chinese heritage through his relationship with some paper dolls that his mother created an animated for him. It's a really lovely story, one that deserved its win of the Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy Award. Ken's also translated _The Three-Body Problem_ from Chinese to English, and written a ""silkpunk"" fantasy novel called _The Grace of Kings_.",2015-08-04 18:03:24+00:00,ctrcacr,1.0,t3_3frrf9,1732.0,printSF

1780,"This is a great thread.

New York City has a couple of good SF/F bookstores. A few of my favorites are:

[McNally Jackson Books](http://www.mcnallyjackson.com/). Soho. Great literary focused bookstore with a solid cafe attached. I actually tend to shop more here for literary fiction. However, downstairs they have a great SF section that tends to come stocked with stuff that you won't see at other bookstores. It feels like whoever buys books for them actually has their own taste, instead of just getting whatever is hot at the moment + the classics. They also have a fair amount of foreign SF/F hidden in the literary area, I've picked up a lot of Calvino's work here. 

[Forbidden Planet](http://www.fpnyc.com/). Broadway south of Union Square. This is primarily a comic book store, but they have a selection of SF/F novels as well. It's a really strange selection, it often seems to be publishers that I don't see at other bookstores. However, it's kind of nice because at times they'll have stuff that no one else in town does. This is where I got The Gormenghast Novels by Mervyn Peake, and Alan Moore's _Voice of the Fire_. 

[Word](http://www.wordbookstores.com/word-brooklyn). Greenpoint. A very small local book store, it reminds me of the bookstore we had back home growing up. One of the nice things is that ""fiction"" is all one big category, so SF/F is mixed in with all the literary fiction. This tends to mirror my own browsing habits better, and I like that the staff seems to recommend SF/F just as much as the latest Brooklyn indie lit press darling. I got Jeff Vandermeer's _Authority_ and Ben Lerner's _10:04_ here. 

[Strand](http://www.strandbooks.com/). Broadway, south of Union Square. Strand is a destination in New York, and rightly so. It's one of the largest independent book stores in the US. They have a tonne of old, rare, and used books, and even new and best sellers. Honestly, the SF selection isn't great, but you sometimes find some real gems for real cheap, so I usually browse through whenever I'm walking buy. I got both volumes of the American Fantasic Tales hardcover anthology for under $20 one time, and bought both of Guy Gavriel Kay's Chinese fantasy novels here as well. Not to mention a number of more literary books. One thing to mention: the store is organized more for wandering and browsing than it is for finding that specific book that you're looking for.

But I've pulled a muscle in my calf. I've already worked out through it once, and it made it much worse. So now I'm left sitting at home talking to reddit instead of hitting my goal because my calf hurts like a mofo and I don't want to injure it worse. 

I might end up moving to some sort of PP routine until my L heals and I can go back to stronglifts for a while.

1817,"Ben Bova's planetary exploration novels were some of my favorites when I was a kid. I'd liken them to _The Martian_ in a lot of ways—small groups exploring the solar system against all odds. If I recall _Jupiter_ was my favorite one. But I haven't read them since early high school so can't vouch for their quality.

Heinlein's _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ might also work for you. As could Bradbury's _The Martian Chronicles_. Oh, and _Rendezvous with Rama_ by Clarke. A lot of golden age SF has this feel, because they were more focused on the rocket tech than the computer tech.

More recently, David Brin's first Uplift War Trilogy follows Earth's earliest forays into galactic civilization. The would largely seem to have the feel you're going for, while being a little bit further in the future and more fantastic. 

Neal Stephenson just released a book called _Seveneves_ that deals with space travel as it might exist tomorrow. I really loved it, it felt like a golden age story but written with a modern eye. Very technical, a lot of infodumps.

I'm not a fan of his writing at all, but the Commonwealth Saga by Peter F. Hamilton might work for you. It's set in 2380, and is about humanity's growth beyond our planet and first encounter with alien life. Personally I felt like it cribbed all its interesting bits from _Hyperion_ and _The Mote in God's Eye_ and went on for way too long, but neither of those novels really has the feel you're going for. Well, _Mote_ might. You should just read that, it's a great book.

Oh, _Ender's Game_ is kind of an obvious one that I'd missed until now. 

That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but it should get you started.

If I build some nice-looking muscles in the process, so much the better. I've already noticed that a lot of little everyday things are easier since starting. Hiking and even running up the stairs to the subway are a lot easier because I can squat more weight. I had to take a large AC out of my girlfriend's closet and it was just an overhead press. Even the bent-over rows help me with housecleaning and anything else where I'm bent over working. 

I had to take a few weeks at only doing 2 days per a week because of work travel, and I've had to repeat my weights a couple of times on the OHP and the row. But even so, I'm up to:

Squat: 170 lbs (tomorrow will do 175, which is my body weight)  
DL: 205 lbs (this is getting really hard)  
Bench: 110 lbs  
OHP: 90 lbs (failed once at this weight, might have to deload again)

1844,"A woman was at her first meditation retreat. It was set in a peaceful monastery in the hills, far away from the city she lived in.

On the first day, there was meditation instruction given by the monks. She began settling into the space. She decided she like it. That night, the monks told everyone to be awake at 6am and in the room for meditation.

At 6am she and the rest of the participants were sitting in the room, meditating. At 6:15, a group of monks walked through the room into the kitchen, where they made a racket setting up for breakfast. Pots were banged, towels snapped, and laughs had. The woman found she could not meditate at all, and for the rest of the day was cranky.

The next morning, the same thing happened. Once again, she didn't meditate, but dwelled on the noise being made by the monks.

On the third morning, as the monks walked in, she quietly stood up and walked over to them. ""Please,"" she said, ""we are meditating here. Could you be quiet while you set up for breakfast? We only have two more days and want to make the most out of them.""

One of the monks looked at her and said, ""When you truly need mindfulness in your life, do you think your life will be as calm as a monastery? If you cannot stay mindful while monks cook, how will you stay mindful on the train, in your office, or while your children call for you?""

I live in NYC, and there are a couple of routes that I do very frequently in a car. UberX consistently costs 5 – 15% more than a cab on the same route. The wait time is usually even. Those times when it's hard to find a cab, Uber is more likely to have a surge that further increases the fare by 25 – 50%.

The point is not that you should privilege my anecdotes over their data. The point is that there are ways to massage the results of a study without doing anything wrong with the data. In this case, they selected a city that has a notoriously bad cab system, and locations within that city that are notoriously bad _for that city_ to find a cab. They then release the study with a name that suggests that this pattern generalizes outside of those locations.

This is terribly dishonest scientific reporting, the kind of thing /r/science would be up in arms about if the NYTimes Science section misinterpreted the data this way. But we're giving a free pass in this case because it's the study authors themselves who are misreporting things, and because they're opening up their data to us?

1860,"I saw Carruth speak at the final showing of Upstream Color at the IFC here in New York. Here are some things I remember from the Q&amp;A:

Before UC, he'd been working on a film called A Topiary about kids who find fantastical monsters in the woods. He eventually abandoned the project for various reasons. Shots from the film were used in UC though: they're the CGI project that Kris is working on at work.

Carruth did practically everything himself. Wrote the film, shot the film, worked with the editor, and even did the business end of things (fundraising, distribution contracts, etc). He said he was glad he had, but in the future he'd be leaving some of the duties to others because it made the project take too long. Particularly distribution I remember him saying.

The film was shot on a modified DSLR camera with various custom lenses. Carruth used to be an engineer, so he actually hacked the firmware of his DSLR so that the light sensor would sense colors differently from what it's meant to. He did this to make it easier to get the color palate he wanted when editing in post-production.

While Carruth neither confirmed nor denied this, one of the audience pointed out that Kris had probably been a SCUBA or free diver—that's why she has the box of gold coins and stuff for the guy to steal, and that's why she practices swimming and picking up rocks. Whether intentional or not, I thought it was a great interpretation of the film.

Spoilers: [In the end, Kris shoots the pig keeper, and through this act of murder finds some semblance of closure. However, the pig keeper never actually hurt her, or anyone! In fact, he's the one who extracted the worms so they didn't live inside her and the other victims. I'd noticed this the first time I watched it, and Carruth confirmed to someone else in the Q&amp;A that this was intentional.](/spoiler)

That's all I remember for now. If anyone has any questions it might job my memory. It was a cool event, Carruth spoke both humbly and intelligently about the filmmaking process and his own intensions for the movie. Will definitely go see him speak again when he next film comes out.  ",2015-07-21 12:20:59+00:00,ctasi4c,1.0,t3_3e11rt,32279.0,NetflixBestOf

1871,"I used to run events for developers in NYC. One of the things I prided myself on was always getting really good food at these events, because it was a minimal extra cost and people _loved_ it, like it would color their entire perception of the event for the better. I'm talking shit like gourmet sandwiches, beautiful salads, handmade deserts, the works. It would cost maybe a dollar more per person per meal to do it that way than to just order a bunch of Chipotle burritos, sometimes it even ended up being cheaper once I knew the caterers well enough. 

One time I ran one of these events in London. I didn't have any catering connections myself out there, but I did some searching and had my people on the ground do some, and we found some guys who were really well reviewed and said all the right things to us, so we hired them.

Come the day of the event, and I'm livid. The food? The worst sandwiches I've ever had. Each sandwich: dry, heavy bread (think stale pumpernickel), one really thick cut chewy piece of meat, thick cut raw onions, one slice of cheese, and way too much mustard on the bottom piece of bread. There was literally nothing but these nasty-ass sandwiches. I was mortified, but put on the happy face because our sponsors had paid big bucks for the event and my job was to make sure everything felt smooth to them.

The #2 reason we remove content is because it breaks our ""no piracy"" rule, and every now and again someone will get _really_ upset that they can't post pirated materials. 

The thing is at this point they're not appealing with any sense of reason, they're just angry and want to vent. Which I get, and I can have compassion for even. However, the job of modding involves enough bullshit without also being a designated private punching bag.

In a place of completely free speech, it is OK to say ""I am going to kill you because you think that cherries taste better than strawberries.""

If you allow people to say anything, and enough people start threating others who like strawberries, than anyone who likes strawberries will eventually leave the site.

At that point, because of free speech, you actually have fewer opinions represented than before.

There is a balancing act to be played between letting people discuss whatever they want, and making sure that they do so in a way where that discussion can continue. Sometimes that means putting in place rules of decorum. Debate societies and parliaments do this using [Robert's Rules](http://www.rulesonline.com/). This way they can talk _about_ anything, while ensuring that everyone's voice is available to be heard. The press does this by having rules about sources, reporting, and what journalists can outright say. 

Social media platforms like Reddit don't have any of these rules. And I think people are beginning to understand that having a place of totally free speech on a platform where literally _everything_ is speech, means that you end up protecting reprehensible actions (such as doxxing, bullying, death threats) and allowing communities to for whose goal is to push out other communities—creating a culture in which ""free speech"" leads to ""talking about things only the majority wants to talk about"".

My goal was not to protect those subs who maliciously link to other subs. If that is a goal of ours, then I think that any anti-brigading solution is going to be severely hampered and not really a solution.

""Always bad"" list. It removes the comment directly, and sends a modmail telling us to consider banning the user and to check out the whole thread in case there's more, uncaught bullshit happening. This also lets us un-delete it on the rare instances where it's not actually an issue (such as when someone is discussing hate speech directly, not engaging in it). These terms are mostly the worst kinds of hate speech, with a few other circlejerks and memes thrown in as well. This is reserved for words that are used in a shitty way over 90% of the time. Mostly deeply bigoted terms with no legitimate, non-bigoted usage in modern English. 

""Usually bad"" list. This sends us a modmail saying we might want to check the thread out and start handing out some warnings or even bans depending on how bad it gets. This is reserved for words that are used in a shitty way at least 50% of the time.

""Sometimes bad"" list. This simply reports the offending comment and leaves a message telling us why it was reported. This is reserved for words that are more frequently used in a way that we won't bother moderating, but that end up alerting us to something bad going on about 10% of the time or more. 

Part of the upkeep of this list is moving words between the lists, or even off them entirely, based on the patterns we see. Some words we thought would be major ""problem"" words end up not often being an issue. Some words that in and of themselves are not a problem, tend to be brought up most frequently in some sort of flame war that we need to step into. The word ""feminists"" for instance is way more frequently brought up in misogynist rants about ""feminists ruining scifi"", which the words ""feminist, feminism"", etc., are usually brought up in civil conversations about the history of feminist science fiction.

It's a fair amount of upkeep, but by being vigilant about updating automod's rules, and checking the modqueue frequently, we can burn through the stuff pretty quickly. It even worked when I used to moderate some larger subreddits, because we had a really active mod team with multiple members checking the modqueue daily. 

The system probably will break down for larger subreddits, but I'd hazard a guess that if you bumped up the ""problem percentages"" for each list, and spent a few weeks updating the lists frequently based on what actually happens once you put them in place, that you'd be able to find a place that helps a lot more than your current situation.",2015-07-08 14:41:45+00:00,csw7ozc,5.0,t1_csvwq28,32315.0,ModSupport
1918,"Right. It seems like really low-hanging fruit to me. I mean, the moderator tools for this already exist, the only things missing are (1) clear rules from the admins on what content moderators must use automoderator to remove, (1a) clear instructions on how to set up and use automoderator to do this, (2) clear guidelines from the admins on what action they'll take if those rules aren't followed, and (3) the willingness on the part of the admins to actually follow through on those rules. No new code, no new tools. Change the human system.

Regarding brigading, I'd love to see a ""global linking blacklist"". Any moderator can add their subreddit to that blacklist by checking a check box in the subreddit settings, just like we can get added or delisted from the global directory by checking a box. Then just have a default automoderator rule that is automatically added to all subreddits and which moderators can't remove, blocking top-level links to those subreddits on the blacklist.

The only new functionality here is a checkbox which adds you to the global blacklist, and the ability to have global, admin-built automoderator rules. But since automod exists everywhere now, I can't imagine that the latter would be that difficult to enact, and the former could even be done by hand at first in a MVP-type test.

Hell, I moderate multiple subreddits that are designed to interact with each other. One is smaller and 99% of its subscribers also subscribe to the larger subreddit.

There are also other subreddits that we're friendly with and I'd feel mostly the same way about.

However, any links from BestOf, SRD, etc, I consider brigading. SRD is particularly beguiling because they won't let us get on any sort of black list, and the admins won't do anything about it, even though we get _huge_ brigades any time we're even mentioned in the comments there.

1924,"I know it's difficult, but I've found that using automoderator to not filter, but rather report certain key words really helps.

Take a word like ""Peruvian"". Set an automod rule that reports all comments with the word ""Peruvian"" with some sort of message telling you ""Check for casual racism, keyword 'peruvian' found.""

If it's not racist, you just hit ""approve"" and it's never an issue, no users even know anything ever happened. If it is racist, you can deal with it as appropriate. 

This is what I do in my subreddits. Granted, they're a _lot_ smaller than r/dota2, but if you have multiple people checking the modqueue frequently it becomes pretty quick work to take care of them all. It's just vital that you use the modqueue.

It's _not_ a fix for people who evade bans, use multiple throwaway accounts, etc.. But it is a way to begin to clean up some of the noise and begin identifying problem users. Just realize that no single piece of technology is going to solve any problems. It's the systems that you as a moderation team implement together that use that technology that will. And each mod team is going to come up with a different use of that tech.

Oh, also, shadowban people using automod instead of outright banning them, especially for the really heinous trolls. If they don't know they're banned, they'll expend a lot of energy commenting and stuff but no one will see it and they'll get no satisfaction of people replying to them, and they eventually begin to fade away.",2015-07-08 00:57:40+00:00,csvo2os,3.0,t1_csvhdzk,11304.0,ModSupport

Squats with the bar. I barely got through it the first day, and had DOMS like crazy. Could barely walk. I gave myself two rest days before my second workout, and powered through the 50lb squat much easier than the 45lb one the workout previous. For the first 2 or 3 weeks, each squat actually got easier even as I was adding more weight every single session. 

If you can do 3 sets of 12 reps of bodyweight squats, you can probably surprise yourself with the bar. And if you fail a set, that's OK: ""deload"" by using lighter dumbells, and come back to the bar on the next session.

As for deadlifts (and barbell rows), I started off using kettlebells. The handles are at just the right height, and my gym has some pretty heavy ones so I could work myself up to the point that I was using 25lb plates for both (my gym has 25 lb bumper plates). I later learned that this is what Mehdi recommends for those who can't hit the row or deadlift weights to begin with.

But it strikes me that he has no Lieutenants. He has no loyal people to help him rule. The one person he did have feared him so much that she went behind his back to his enemies, and he had her killed. He has no worry for ""killing those who are devoted to him"" because he has no one devoted to him.

Practically, why does this matter? He has no one he trusts to look after the Riverlands while he's in the North, no one to take on the duties of being Warden of the North while he's in the Vale. All he has is a few flimsy pieces of paper issued by an out-of-favor queen, and his cunning.

His cunning counts for a lot, but cunning alone isn't enough to be a leader. You need loyalty and trust as well. You need to have people you can delegate to. 

Petyr has none of that. In many ways, he's built a house of cards for himself, and as soon as someone realizes that it's just a ""shadow on the wall"", I think his power will crumble quite quickly.

1967,"I've definitely read this and know what you're talking about, but I can't remember the title or who wrote it.

I have a little bit of a feeling that it was written specifically as some sort of thought experiment, maybe by an academic philosopher, or someone in the ""rationalist"" movement like Eliezer Yudkowsky or one of his buddies? Or maybe Sam Hughes even? 

I'll do some poking around and see if I can't find anything.",2015-06-16 20:01:02+00:00,cs8qm16,1.0,t3_3a2mrj,2802.0,printSF
1968,"_Ender's Shadow_ isn't the direct sequel to _Ender's Game_. That was actually _Speaker for the Dead_, which follow's Ender's life thousands of years later. As u/DropPayload says, it's a great book, probably my favorite of Card's.

The Shadow Series (as _Ender's Shadow_ and the rest of the Bean-focused books are called) was definitely not planned for by Orson Scott Card, so you're right about the ret-cons. However, it shares more in common with _Ender's Game_ in terms of tone, structure, and themes, than _Speaker_ and the latter books in that series do.",2015-06-16 19:57:40+00:00,cs8qh5t,1.0,t3_3a2gts,5034.0,printSF

1971,"Play sports or do yoga. 

Find a local soccer club and play with them. Ask the folks there for drills that they did when playing in high school / college, and run those drills on your own time if folks don't drill together. Soccer is great for coordination, because you're always doing several things at a time (at minimum, running + whatever else). 

Then yoga, especially with an instructor who focuses more on breathing, body awareness, and mindfulness than on strength training. It's practicing feeling where every part of your body is in relation to every other part, and mindfully moving them together between certain poses. I find this kind of yoga really rewarding. And it's still a workout, but a different kind of workout than the more bodyweight fitness type yogas. 

(edit: I have [this yoga DVD](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Journal-Stress-With-Baxter/dp/B000H0MKHO) and highly recommend it, although nothing beats learning with an instructor)

You can also take up something like rock climbing, parkour, or other bodyweight sports. The key is that you be willing to drill to get better, and that you do them with people who are better than you are and can act as teachers.",2015-06-16 14:05:05+00:00,cs8clcx,1.0,t3_3a07i3,32182.0,Fitness
1972,"I run a 5x5 too.

I do some stretches, think about how the last set went, and visualize how I'm going to improve my next set. Also maybe stare at myself in the mirror to pump myself up.",2015-06-16 13:44:58+00:00,cs8bza4,1.0,t3_39wvi6,86925.0,Fitness
1973,"http://stronglifts.com/apps/

I use this too, it's great. I can just turn off my brain when I get into the gym and let the app do my thinking for me. I focus 100% on how my current set is going, how the last set went, and how the next set is going to go. It keeps track of literally everything else, and tells me exactly when to do what.

As a beginner, it's a godsend.",2015-06-16 13:43:17+00:00,cs8bxgf,3.0,t1_cs7frvx,69552.0,Fitness
