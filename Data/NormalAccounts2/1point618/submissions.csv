We have liberals and conservatives here, and that is good as long as they're disagreeing on substance and choosing to listen to each other.

It is only when ideologies preclude the humanity and equality of certain people that the people who espouse those ideologies are unwelcome here.

Unfortunately, those kinds of ideologies are becoming more and more accepted on reddit and elsewhere.

When people want to talk about a certain kind of book or author, do so without shitting on them for it. You may respectfully disagree on specifics, but do not attempt to shut down discussion in the first place.

This especially goes for threads about black or women authors. Sometimes people want to read books from a different point of view, and that is OK and good. It's what SF is all about. So drive-by comments and continued arguments about why it's racist/sexist to try to read a diverse group of authors will not be tolerated, and the people arguing will be banned.

(FWIW, the same would be true for, say, liberals piling up saying that conservative SF is trash and shouldn't be read. But that has never been a problem, while piling up on people who want to read women, PoC, or queer authors has been.)

If you see this kind of behavior, please downvote, report the comments, and don't respond. We will take care of it.

This is not an infringement of your free speech. There are places where you can have those conversations, but they are not _in those threads_. 

I and the rest of this mod team have long maintained that we can either be a safe space for assholes, or a safe space for everyone else. We choose the latter. We choose to listen to and learn from others who are different from us, whether that means they like a different genre, or are a different gender, or come from any other different background.

Hate r/printSF? Take the survey and tell us. Love r/printSF? Take the survey and tell us. Dislike a specific rule, genre, post type, or book? Take the survey and tell us. Have a great idea to improve the sub? Take the survey!

Just like awesome SF art? Take the survey and check out all the art I added to it.

**To be entered to win reddit gold**, either add your username to the survey, or if you don't feel comfortable with that, reply to my sticked comment below.

At the end of this week I'll hand out reddit gold to 12 random users who entered, and next week I'll put together a big report about the state of the subreddit according to you, our users.

Friendly neighborhood mod here checking in. So far, we've had 63 people take our survey, which is fewer people than took the r/SF_Book_Club survey and about 1/4 of the total I was hoping for, so let's spruce things up. 

#[Take the r/printSF community survey!](https://goo.gl/forms/xT6bBFU8F7mZgYgk1)

In the final report, I'm going to do a report that includes notes on each one of the rules + each one of the content types, including graphs and quotes from long answers about those specific rules/content types. Here's what one of each would look like (in both cases, I picked the most controversial one). 

We also asked a bunch of questions about people's favorite subreddits, reading habits, etc., so below you can find a simple list of favorite subreddits—we'll include the full lists and graphs in the final report.

## Rules

### No posts about TV or Movies

First, the graph: http://i.imgur.com/OiXjhbI.png

I'll admit this was a bit of a surprise to me. Of our top 10 posts of all time, 3 of them are me making a mod announcement not to post TV or Movies, so I expected this to be one of the less controversial rules. And in a way, it is: only a single person choose ""hate it"", less than any other rule up there! However, there seems to be a growing consensus that we're perhaps too strict about the rule.

Based on the long answers, I think some of this is a misunderstanding.

&gt; I think the 'no tv shows' one is basically sound, but needs a bit of leeway when people are discussing adaptions of books for film/ tv. It Can be interesting to see what others would have done, how they'd visualised stuff differently, reasons for changes ietc

-

&gt; Tv/movie restrictions...I KNOW this can get out of hand, but I think there should be some discussion about books that are turned into, or could be made into movies.

-

&gt; I think it is fine to post about movies or TV shows IN RELATION to books.

This is actually the rule as it stands! We allow posts about TV/Movie adaptations as long as the post is about how the adaptation is adapting the TV/Movie, not just about the TV/Movie itself. So trailers, news about casting, episode recaps, etc., aren't allowed. But if you make a text post about the book in relation to the movie, we'll let that through.

The problem is that I've _never_ seen that post get made. Something we mods have been talking about is to have a semi-regular megathread about TV/Movies—a place for the community to talk about TV/Movies with each other while keeping it off the rest of the subreddit.

Before we make any decisions though, I want more feedback! [Please take the survey and let us know your thoughts](https://goo.gl/forms/xT6bBFU8F7mZgYgk1) (or if you've already taken it, comment below).

## Content

### Tip of my Tongue / Help me Remember posts

The graph: http://i.imgur.com/jSx9Wb5.png

So this is interesting. I and the other mods fully expected this to be heavy on the ""less please"" end of things, but ""less"" and ""more"" are actually almost tied! However, relative to the other categories it's in the middle for ""more"" votes and ""just enough"" votes, while being on the high end for ""less"" votes. So it's both the most disliked and the most controversial type of content, not what I was expecting!

We only got one piece of long-form feedback on these posts:

&gt; A weekly sticky for ""Help me recall what book this is"" posts would be nice. Those posts clog up the front page at times.

I'm still not quite sure how to handle this, and we're going to wait to see more data before we make any decisions. A monthly post might work, although unless it's always stickied it's going to be a pain for new users coming here to try to ask. Maybe making a certain day ""Tip of my Tongue Tuesdays"" or ""What's this Book Wednesdays""? Please [take the survey and let us know](https://goo.gl/forms/xT6bBFU8F7mZgYgk1)!

## Community Info

### Favorite Subreddits

Over 1/3rd of the correspondents said r/printSF was their favorite subreddit, which makes me feel (\^_\^) but also wasn't what I was hoping for or expecting: rather, I want to add to our ""recommended subreddits"" list with suggestions from the community. Here are what we have so far.

If you want to add to this list then [take our survey](https://goo.gl/forms/8UM9rMsUIaDuKy9t2) and make sure to check ""yes, I want to answer more questions"" at the end of the first page.

## Survey contest!

So that's the report, what about the contest?

OK, so pretty simple. I'm going to get 12 reddit gold credits and randomly give them to 12 people who have filled out the survey. 

# [So take the survey!](https://goo.gl/forms/8UM9rMsUIaDuKy9t2)

**Then either fill out your reddit username in the survey, or comment ON THE STICKIED COMMENT below.**

People who have already left their reddit username in the survey will automatically be entered. If you've already filled out the survey, **don't do it again, but leave a comment on my stickied comment below**.

What if you want to cheat? Whatever, if someone enters a million usernames one of them will probably get golded. However, if they're throw-away accounts what's the point? You could also just comment without filling out the survey, that's a bummer but I can't stop anyone. I just ask that you don't cheat, and if you do really want to cheat, **please don't fill out the survey multiple times because you'll fuck up our data**, just make comments below. 

However, **I will only award gold to usernames that have a history posting on r/printSF**. If you haven't posted before today, you're not eligible, sorry. This is a survey for the community that already exists, it's about making things better for our current members, not trying to be more appealing to other people or to grow faster. 

Hopefully the admins will give me some gold credits to give to you all, otherwise this is all coming out of pocket. I'll select people by putting all the names in a spreadsheet, running a random number generator 12 times, and given gold to those users by cell row number. If anyone doesn't have a posting history on r/printSF that I can see, I'll strike their name and go to the next person on the list. I'll run the contest before the end of September, probably in the last week, and will make one more post reminding people before I do.

I've put together [a survey](https://goo.gl/forms/178MriIUlHQ56dDQ2) about r/printSF and I'd love to get your feedback on the health of the sub.

#[Take the survey.](https://goo.gl/forms/178MriIUlHQ56dDQ2)

The whole thing should take about 10-15 minutes to fill out. We only _really_ need you to fill out the first page, which will be closer to 5-10 minutes, but I'd love as much user data from the second page as possible. Regardless, **you must hit submit on the 2nd page or your answers from the first won't be recorded**. Google forms is dumb, but it's free. 

All of your answers will go to us improving the subreddit. After a week or two, I'll post a report with graphs from the survey and some preliminary ideas on how we might take action based on what we've learned. I promise not to share individual answers outside of the mod team here, although the report will include aggregated data and quotes from the long answer sections. 

We did this in r/SF_Book_Club recently and it was really helpful. If you use rSFBC, we'd love [your feedback there too](https://www.reddit.com/r/SF_Book_Club/comments/51hn2k/meta_lets_talk_about_sf_book_club/). 

But the real kicker is the r/printSF feedback form. I'm hoping to get over 250 replies so that I can drill pretty far down into the data. So please do consider taking some time and filling it out.

#[Help us improve r/printSF.](https://goo.gl/forms/178MriIUlHQ56dDQ2)

Also feel free to discuss the subreddit and expound on any survey answers in the thread below, just please fill out the survey before doing that so we get your unbiased answers. I and the other mods will be lurking and engaging in the discussion, so feel free to treat it as an informal mod AMA as well. 

If you think of any answers after the fact, please post them in the comments below and I'll add them to your answers in the system. Don't fill the survey out twice.

What up SF Book Club?

As you might have noticed, there hasn't been a lot of discussion here lately. We've seen 3 months without anyone starting discussion on the current books out of the last 4, the last two author Q&amp;As only had a few people participate, and while they still get a lot of books recommended, the selection threads get fewer votes than they used to. 

Our stats are down too. We've decreased in unique visitors and pageviews every single month this year. August saw 3/5ths the number of unique users as January, and 1/2 the number of pageviews! 

However, this hasn't meant that rSFBC is any less work for us mods. More manhours go into moderating rSFBC than into r/printSF, even though it has 1/3rd the subscribers and 1/10th the participation rate. 

So, something needs to change, and we want to make sure that it's something that will make the community happy! After all, while we enjoy participating here as well, we're doing this for you.

We've created a survey, and would ask that if you've ever come to rSFBC, please fill it out. The more answers and ideas we get to it, the better we can make this place in the future. You'll be ensuring the future survival of one of the largest bookclubs on reddit, and until this month the longest-running contiguous monthly book club. 

Also, please fill out the survey before reading or commenting below, as we'd like to have your unfiltered thoughts. Then come and discuss with others what you think and build off their ideas!

As with all our megathreads, the rules work a little differently here than in the rest of the subreddit.

1. No slates, no electioneering. You may recommend things for people to read, you may talk about how you're voting on individual works or in specific categories, but please do not post your entire ballot or recommend that others vote a certain way on specific works. We will read into the spirit of the comments, and comments which are seen as trying to convince people to vote a certain way will be removed. Links to slates that other people are putting together will also be removed, although you can discuss them generally. For our purposes, ""slates"" are defined as encouraging people to vote a specific way across a large swath of the Hugo ballot, and there will be some ""we'll know it when we see it"" moderation going on here, so don't get upset if we remove something or ask you to edit it, it's nothing personal.

2. Be civil. Our rule always holds true. You may (and should!) disagree, but disagree with ideas, not with people. This includes no name-calling (even against people who are not participating in the thread) and no bigotry.

3. Self-promotion is A-OK! If you've written something relevant somewhere else, link to it. Maybe you have a blog post of your eligible works this year, or your thoughts on how the Hugos will go, or your own gushing about your favorite artist this year. As long as it doesn't break any of our other subreddit or megathread rules, it's OK—but if it does break the rules, we'll be handling it the same way we would as if you'd posted it to the subreddit. This also means that if you have a work that is Hugo-eligible this year, you can post it for people to read and consider: but please also post the works of other people as well!

4. From now until the ceremonies, all Hugo 2016 discussion goes in these megathreads. We'll post new megathreads as there is more news to be discussed. Posts about the 2016 Hugos to the subreddit will be removed by automoderator.

# The Greats

These are my favorite post-apocalyptic novels. They are not quite in order of very best to best, but rather in the order in which I want to talk about them. 

## _A Canticle for Leibowitz_ by Walter M. Miller, Jr.

This is, in my mind, the single greatest story about the apocalypse ever written. It's told in three long stories, each following a monk from the same Catholic monastery after the world has all but ended due to nuclear war. The Church is one of the only institutions that wants to keep scientific knowledge alive. Each story follows a different monk, and showcases a struggle they go through to keep some knowledge alive. There are post-apocalyptic politics, strange meldings of Jewish and Catholic mysticism, and one of the most ""real"" post-apocalyptic worlds you'll read about. 

## _Wittgenstein's Mistress_ by David Markson

This is a strange, experimental novel. It's narrated by a woman who is the last woman on Earth for unknown reasons. Having no one to talk to, she goes slowly mad. The book takes the form of her highly literate but definitely crazy first-person ramblings. It's a meditation on how our relationships make us who we are, on art and literature, on loss, on what it is to be human. I highly recommend it to anyone with the stomach for postmodern and/or experimental novels.

## _Soft Apocalypse_ by Will McIntosh

Nearly perfect. Rather than ending with a bang, Will McIntosh (an academic sociologist) shows how the world could slowly turn apocalyptic. Throw in a dash of climate change, a pinch of economic slowdown, and enough time, and before you know it former members of the middle class are wandering the countryside while the richest people live in hyper-futurist enclaves. It's a punk rock story about the world ending with a whimper, following one young man as he tries to make a living and find love in this strange new world. To me, the best insight of the novel was that no matter how bad and strange things get, people are versatile enough to just think of the ""now"" as normal, as long as change happens slowly enough.

## _Dark Eden_ by Chris Beckett

This is one of those places where I've interpreted ""post-apocalypse"" broadly. Set on a wandering planet, a world of forever night, after a space ship crash-lands, it tells the tale of the 500 or so 5th generation descendents of the two people on the space ship. They have formed a small tribal community which is pushing against the natural resource limits of the small warm forrest that the live in. While the main character's plot is at times predictable, the setting is incredible and the story of a matriarchal tribe tearing itself apart and becoming a patriarchy was fascinating.

## _1491_ by Charles Mann

""Isn't that non-fiction?"" I hear you say. Yes it is. _1491_ is a wonderful history book about what the Americas were like before Columbus ""discovered"" them. One of the most striking elements of the book is how our conception of Indians as ""nomadic tribal hunter-gatherers"" was not actually true: they were largely civilized, agricultural, stationary polities, even in North America, until Europeans brought diseases that ravaged the native communities in advance of the Europeans themselves. It's estimated that somewhere in the range of 50% to 90% natives died before Europeans even saw them, so in truth the ""nomadic hunter-gatherers"" lifestyle had more in common with the folks on _The Walking Dead_ than they did with their parents' or grandparents' lifestyles. 

## _Blindness_ by Jose Saramago

Oh boy, this novel. _Blindness_ is perhaps the most depraved thing I've ever read, which is exactly what it's trying to be. In a small town, people start going blind. First one or two, and soon hundreds of people at a time. The blind are rounded up and put in prison to try to quarantine them. Within days, as more and more people (even outside of the prisons) go blind, society completely breaks down and a brute sort of anarchy reigns supreme. The animal in man is brought out. Rape, murder, and torture become everyday activities. The story is told through the eyes of a woman who doesn't go blind but follows her husband to prison anyway, and who bears witness to the depths that humanity falls to as soon as society ceases to hold power over us. A terrifying novel. 

## The War Against the Chtorr by David Gerrold

So War Agains the Chtorr is what happens when you cross _Soft Apocalypse_ with _Blindness_ and add plenty of man-eating wormlike aliens and a gonzo, heavy metal attitude. I read this still-unfinished series 15 years ago, and just re-read them, and they hold up just as well. An alien ecology is infesting an Earth reeling from losing 1/2 the population due to massive plagues, and it's up to elite teams of scientist/soldiers to figure out what the fuck is going on. While it sounds like old school scifi fun and games, the books delve into a lot of philosophy and cover a lot of the same ground that _Blindness_ does, asking where our humanity lies and whether we can still keep it as the world around us goes to shit, and the answer probably isn't what we want to hear.

## _10:04_ by Ben Lerner

What is contemporary lit-fic written by a Brooklyn hipster poet doing on this list? Being one of the best-written stories about the modern apocalypse we're currently going through as a species, that's what. A large part of the book is about New York City after hurricanes Irene and Sandy, the reeling feelings we all had after these super-storms straight out of a scifi novel put the city on hold for days and weeks. The sense of ""anything is normal while it's happening"" comes through strongly. It's also beautifully written and includes some of the best writing on art that I've ever read.

## _Stand Still. Stay Silent._ by Minna Sundberg

A beautifully drawn and lovingly written science fantasy story about a world where the only survivors from a harrowing world-wide plague are small groups of people living in Scandinavia. It's a forever-winter world of the arctic crossed with pagan folk wizards. It's both twee and heavy metal at the same time. Definitely the best web comic I've ever read, up there with the best comics, period.

## _The Fifth Season_ by NK Jemisin

A man beats his son to death, and a woman comes home to find his body. Across the world, a powerful mage sick of the enslavement of other mages creates a super-volcano which splits the world's only continent in two. Years before, a young girl is taken from her family to be taught how to wield her power which lets her cause and dampen earthquakes, and another young mage is sent on a month-long mission with a senior mage with whom her mage's society tells her she must procreate, against both their will. These are the four stories that start _The Fifth Season_, a story of the end of society in a world-ending cataclysm. In a genre which loves its ""plucky female protagonists"", the lead female character is a human instead of a caricature, a loving mother with revenge in her heart, seeking her husband and remaining daughter across an ash-blown landscape as society reels in the aftermath of the worst earthquake in recorded history. I just finished this novel and loved it so much. I am afraid I don't have many intelligent things to say about it because it's so fresh, but read it read it read it. You'll be glad you did and angry that the next book in the trilogy is not out yet. 

---

# The Good

These are all post-apocalyptic novels that I think are worth reading. None of them is a favorite of the genre, but neither do any of them hold fatal flaws that keep me from recommending them. Alphabetical order by last name.

## _Oryx and Crake_ by Margaret Atwood

I enjoyed this book, but find I have very little to say about it. The worldbuilding was fantastic if a bit heavy handed, and the story was totally engrossing. I've never really had any desire to pick up the sequels. A solid SF novel written by a literary author, although she does fall into the traps that literary authors tend to when writing SF. 

## _The Martian Chronicles_ by Ray Bradbury

I don't normally think of this novel as a ""post-apocalyptic"" story, but as I was compiling this list it became apparent that it actually contains three apocalypses: the first, and the most moving to me, is the death of the Martians themselves, followed by the nuclear war on Earth and the desolation on Mars after. The first apocalypse is, to me, the best explored. ""—And the Moon be Still as Bright"" + ""The Settlers"" combined makes one of my favorite short stories of all time, the story of a man who realizes he is complicit in the genocide of a native race and who can't take that realization. _The Martian Chronicles_ is one of the few novels on this list to have internalized the lessons that _1491_ teaches: that apocalypse has already happened on this planet, it's just that we don't know it because we were _the cause_. Other stories set on Mars after most people have gone back to Earth are also good, especially ""There Will Come Soft Rains"" which is perhaps one of the best stories ever written to feature no characters at all.

## _The Book of Strange New Things_ by Michel Faber

The main story in this novel is about an evangelical priest who goes on a missionary trip to a strange new planet. It's a weird book, one that I 100% loved. One of the sub-plots is that the wife of the main character is left on Earth, and he and she can only communicate through faster-than-light emails to one another. As he has a wonderful if strange time on the planet proselytizing to his alien flock, climate change and political unrest get worse and worse back home, leading to some of the emails from her being harrowing stories of her times in a post-apocalyptic world which seemed normal just weeks or months ago (harkening to the themes in _Soft Apocalypse_). This book is amazing for so many reasons, and only doesn't make the ""greats"" because it's only the email stories within the story that contain post-apocalyptic elements.

## _Afterlife_ by Simon Funk

This is a free, online novel (of which there are several on this list). A man wakes up in a strange world where people are happy and never sick, but from which they can't leave. He dreams of a past life where he was a computer researcher. As time goes on, he realizes that these dreams are more than just nightmares, and that the Earth he knows is long gone, replaced by [spoiler](/s ""self-replicating machines which cover the face of the Earth, doing inscrutable tasks—machines which as an AI researcher he laid the foundation for."") Really fascinating novel, definitely worth reading.

## _The Gone-Away World_ by Nick Harkaway

I loved this book, as weird as it was. 1/3rd kung-fu coming of age story, 1/3rd corporate thriller, 1/3rd military apocalypse novel. Harkaway writes an incredibly fast, tight, and entertaining plot, but the speed and entertainment don't hide a lack of intellectualism. Instead, you get great ideas on every page. Great read and lots of fun.

## _Fine Structure_ by Sam Hughes

Ultra-dimensional beings fighting to the death take out Earth as a casualty of their conflict. This is the story of what that looks like from our lowly 4-dimensional sight. Strange scientific experiments, super-heros being born stronger and stronger each year, and a series of dystopias and apocalypses. Fun, smart book which was written as a serialized novel and is available for free online.

## _A Feast for Crows_ by George R.R. Martin

The 4th of GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire novels. It takes place after wars have ravaged the countryside of Westeros, and many of the chapters involve the fallout that the average person of this world deals with as a result of the wars that up until now you've only seen through the eyes of the nobles who caused them. While an interesting book from that perspective, it's the weakest of the ASoIaF novels over-all, and would be in the ""meh"" category if this were just a ranking of Martin's fantasy novels.

## _Cloud Atlas_ &amp; _The Bone Clocks_ by David Mitchell

These are two very different novels, except each contains one story set in the same post-apocalyptic world (a setting which Mitchell has also visited in some short stories). These books are absolutely wonderful, and deserve to be read. They are only not in the ""great"" category because the so little of them actually focuses on the post-apocalyptic setting. But seriously, read _Cloud Atlas_, an experimental postmodern novel which follows six stories in six genres and has some of the best prose work you'll see this side of Nabokov.

## _Apocalypsopolis_ by Ran Prieur

I liked this novel, but you could tell the author lost interest part-way through, and the story just sort of trails off rather than ending well. It's in some ways an experiment by the author to write a story of the apocalypse, rather than a post-apocalyptic story, and as he said: that's really hard to do well. However, the novel gets definite points for trying, for having some really creative ideas, and for having some awesome weird Native American shadowlands chapters. Plus, it's free online so the price is right.

## _Seveneves_ by Neal Stephenson

I _loved_ this novel, but based on feedback from /r/SF_Book_Club it was a polarizing one. The moon explodes and we realize we have only 3 years before the shards rain hellfire down on Earth, so the whole Earth pitches in building structures in space and sending people up. After the Earth dies, the several hundred people in space slowly whittle themselves down to fewer and fewer due to accidents and politics gone crazy. I really enjoyed the near-future hard science of getting everyone into space and the politics that played out amongst the spacers.

## _Tales of the Dying Earth_ by Jack Vance

Fantasy stories sent on a far-future Earth where technology is so advanced that it's actually become magic. These are fantastic adventure stories which don't get nearly enough love amongst genre fans. Vance's prose is astounding and the world he built, of techno-wizards and rogues, is a blast to read about.

## _Infinite Jest_ by David Foster Wallace

What is easily one of the great 20th Century American novels contained some definitely apocalyptic elements. A ""concavity"" where Northern New England used to sit where giant babies and herds of feral hamsters run wild. Wheelchair-bound French-Canadian assassins. And a video so wildly entertaining, that anyone who watches it loses all will to do anything else. The novel is dense and rich and rewarding, and Wallace cares about his characters like no other novelist has. It's only here instead of in the ""greats"" because it's light in terms of being a post-apocalyptic novel.

## _The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect_ by Roger Williams

Another free internet novel about AI run amok, although one in which the AI is all-loving, all-caring and still causes the apocalypse. It's short and fun to read (although _really_ gruesome at points), so rather than review it I'm just going to say that you ought to read it, it's fun and totally worth the price.

## The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe

Another far-future, Dying Earth book. This, instead of being short stories, is four novels which form a single narrative (not unlike The Lord of the Rings trilogy). The Earth is falling apart under the weight of its own history, and a torturer is kicked out of his guild for showing compassion to a woman under his ""care"". This book is one of the densest I've ever read, full of puzzles and unreliable narrators. You really have to read between the lines to get what's going on. I had the strange sensation of actively disliking the books while I read all 1000 pages of their intensely dense prose, but loved it in hindsight. 

---

# The Meh

Some of these are books I love but which have fatal flaws. Some of them are good books, but not very good post-apocalypse tales. And some of them are awful and shouldn't be read. Happily, I've already figured out which is which for you. Although be forewarned, some of these reviews are not going to be very popular. In alphabetical order by last name.

## _Nightfall_ by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg

A novelization of Asimov's wonderful short story by Silverberg. It adds a lot of new content to the end, after the stars come out, which when I read it in high school wasn't all that gripping and created somewhat of an anti-climax after the great reveal that ends the original story. I haven't read it in 15+ years, and am unlikely to again.

## _The Windup Girl_ by Paolo Bacigalupi

I found the world just too unbelievable here. I have no problem with fantasy or mystical settings, but this was presented as straight SF inside the novel itself. The conceit of ""energy is expensive, so we'll use human and animal energy and store it in springs"" just doesn't make any sense: it's more expensive for animals to create energy than for an engine to do so, even out of the same fuel. In addition, the plot meandered too much and the only sympathetic character was killed off early on. I know it won the Hugo, but I just didn't like this one.

## _Nod_ by Adrian Barnes

A cheap knock-off of _Blindness_. I wanted this to be so much better than it actually was, as the conceit (""suddenly no one can sleep"") was so good. The insomnia, the waking dreams, the slow insanity that not sleeping causes. Such ripe territory to explore! But it just didn't come through, instead going over the same ground that _Blindness_ did while being less well written and less well thought through.

## _The Painted Man_ and _The Desert Spear_ by Peter V. Brett

I enjoyed _The Painted Man_ well enough, until a graphic and unnecessary rape scene was directly followed by the raped character working out her emotions by having graphic and unnecessary sex with the protagonist. Just a little too close to ""wank fantasy"" territory for my tastes, and one that is pretty sexist at that. Then _The Desert Spear_ just wasn't as well written or interesting as _The Painted Man_, so I gave up on the series. I really wanted to love it though, as the setting was great: every night, demons come out of the Earth itself and so humanity only survives huddled in small villages and cities with anti-demon wards painted around them. Really great fantasy setting and world-building but really disappointing characters and story. Happily. _The Fifth Season_ ended up being everything that I wanted _The Painted Man_ to be, and so much more.

## _World War Z_ by Max Brooks

I'm pretty so-so on zombies. I love a good b-movie zombie film, but whenever they get taken too seriously I start to yawn and lose interest. Some of the stories here were good, some of them were so-so, but too many of them were just boring. In addition, I'd hoped to see some of the characters show up in multiple stories so you'd see how they changed over time, and that never happened—even with the world changing so much, the characters were all remarkably flat. I know this isn't a character-driven novel, but that's just not something that I enjoy.

## The Tripods Trilogy by John Christopher

I read these as a kid and loved them. I have almost no memory of them now, and doubt I'll ever bother reading them again. But hey, I said ""every book"" and some I'm leaving this shitty review here goddamn it. 

## _The Hunger Games_ by Suzanne Collins

Meh. Politicians make kids fight for... reasons? A ""strong female protagonist"" with no agency, a badass fighter who doesn't actually do any fighting and whose only meaningful choice is which boy she likes (spoiler alert, she doesn't make up her mind). Not my cup of tea.

## _Wool_ by Hugh Howey

This is a novel fully based on a twist ending, a twist which was telegraphed from the very beginning and wasn't very well executed even then. Also, the setting is totally unoriginal, why do people harp on about how original it was? _Fine Structure_ lampooned the setting and came up with the same twist, and was published years earlier, and is 100x better writing. Read that instead. Also, Howey is a misogynistic douchebag who treats people horribly. I don't understand why these novels are popular.

## _Footfall_ by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle

Another novel I know I read and just don't remember at all. Aliens destroy Earth with kinetic weapons, I think? That was pretty bad-ass. And some people fight back and stuff? I don't know, but _The Mote in God's Eye_ by the same authors was fucking phenomenal so this can't be all that bad right? That's my review, ""I don't remember it but it can't be all that bad, right?""

## _Atlas Shrugged_ by Ayn Rand

Yup, I read this whole thing. All 800 pages, 60 of which were a single fucking monologue. That monologue took me almost a week to read, it was so boring. Honestly, I really enjoyed some parts of the novel and Rand had a knack for straw-manning people in a way that really made you hate them, but even in high school I found her philosophy repugnant (still do!) and the novel has too many flaws to be worth reading as literature. 

## _Endymion_ &amp; _Rise of Endymion_ by Dan Simmons

These read like bad fan-fiction of the _Hyperion_ novels, which is strange since they were written by the same author. 

## _Cat's Cradle_ by Kurt Vonnegut

I love Vonnegut, and I used to love this novel, but the truth is that it suffers from a number of internal inconsistencies that take me out of the story. In addition, while Bokononism seemed profound to 15-year-old angry atheist me, to 30-year-old Buddhist me it's a little... trite as far as philosophies go. _Slaughterhouse 5_ is still amazing though.

## _The War of the Worlds_ by H.G. Wells

I'm pretty sure I read this one too. I know I listened to the radio play on tape as a kid, because my grandfather would send me a bunch of old scifi radio plays every year. I loved that shit, Dimension X especially. You can find a bunch of them, including Dimension X, on Archive.org these days. They're a treat to listen to. But I don't actually remember much about this novel that isn't filter through the radio play and the two different movie adaptations that I've seen, so this final review is going to be a little bit anti-climactic.

[Nominations are open](http://midamericon2.org/the-hugo-awards/) as of today! **Sunday is the last chance to [sign up for Worldcon](http://midamericon2.org/registration/) to become a voting member!**

As such, we wanted to kick off the conversation about what people think are nomination-worthy works this year. Just like last year, we're going to do a series of megathreads about the Hugos, although this year we'll be attempting to make them have themes rather than just be a clearing house like last year.

Now that nominations are open, let's discuss what books, stories, magazines, and artists were the best of 2015. Tell us which books and stories we should read and consider for nominations, discuss how you think the nominations will go, share articles and blogs about the process, and more!

edit: /u/GregHullender's [comment about all the eligible works](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/439lvc/hugo_nominations_megathread_sign_up_recommend_and/czh6uve) is not to be missed!

--- 

As with all our megathreads, the rules work a little differently here than in the rest of the subreddit. 

1. No slates, no electioneering. You may recommend things for people to read, you may talk about how you're voting on individual works or in specific categories, but you may not talk about ballots as a whole or recommend that others vote a certain way on works. We will read into the spirit of the comments, and comments which are seen as trying to convince people to vote a certain way will be removed. Links to slates that other people are putting together will also be removed. For our purposes, ""slates"" are defined as encouraging people to vote a specific way across a large swath of the Hugo ballot.

2. Be civil. Our rule always holds true. You may (and should!) disagree, but disagree with ideas, not with people. This includes no name-calling (even against people who are not participating in the thread) and no bigotry.

3. Self-promotion is A-OK! If you've written something relevant somewhere else, link to it. Maybe you have a blog post of your eligible works this year, or your thoughts on how the Hugos will go, or your own gushing about your favorite artist this year. As long as it doesn't break any of our other subreddit or megathread rules, it's OK—but if it does break the rules, we'll be handling it the same way we would as if you'd posted it to the subreddit. This also means that if you have a work that is Hugo-eligible this year, you can post it for people to read and consider: but please also post the works of other people as well!

4. From now until the ceremonies, all Hugo 2016 discussion goes in these megathreads. We'll post new megathreads as there is more news to be discussed. Posts about the 2016 Hugos to the subreddit will be removed by automoderator.

5. No brigading or linking to this thread from elsewhere on reddit. ",printSF,"Hugo Nominations megathread! Sign up, recommend and read great SF, then vote!",https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/439lvc/hugo_nominations_megathread_sign_up_recommend_and/

This was my favorite book that I read last year, and folks on the subreddit seem pretty excited to discuss it. I figured it'd be relevant here as well, and would love to get some new blood in the subreddit in this new year!

The novel follows a preacher sent to a newly discovered planet to convert the natives. The focus of the novel is on his relationships: his strained relationship with his wife left back home on a crumbling Earth, his awkward relationships with the people at the alien base, and the kind and loving relationship he has with his partitioners, the fetus-faced aliens. 

The book club works differently from others: each month we select a new book, and for that month it becomes a subreddit devoted to that book. You can post discussion any time, post any relevant links, etc.. Just please tag your posts with [strange] if it's about this book, and [spoilers] if the post contains any spoilers.

PrintSF has been going strong for 5 years now, and we've grown to the point that we're going to his 25,000 users soon. In the past year, the other mods and I have all had stuff come up in real life that means that we have much less time to mod. As the sub grows and our time shrinks, we wanted to put the sub in a good place for the next five years. That's why we're adding so many people all at once.

These five have all been frequent and high-quality contributors to printSF, and either have mod experience or have worked with us closely in running community initiatives, so /u/punninglinguist, /u/gabwyn, and /u/apatt and I reached out to see if they'd like to help out.

This should mean that we're able to respond a lot more quickly to questions on the sub, more quickly remove rule-breaking material, and will have bandwidth to do some more fun events on the sub. 

Personally, printSF continues to be my favorite subreddit to read and participate in. I originally started the sub because I wanted to have a spot on the internet where people could have in-depth discussions on great SF books, and it continues to be that and more. I've always been so impressed by all the users of this sub, so thank you to everyone who participates to make this the amazing place that it is.

[_Dark Eden_ by Chris Becket](http://smile.amazon.com/Dark-Eden-Chris-Beckett/dp/0804138680/)

Description from Amazon: 

&gt; On the alien, sunless planet they call Eden, the 532 members of the Family take shelter beneath the light and warmth of the Forest’s lantern trees. Beyond the Forest lie the mountains of the Snowy Dark and a cold so bitter and a night so profound that no man has ever crossed it. 

&gt; The Oldest among the Family recount legends of a world where light came from the sky, where men and women made boats that could cross the stars. These ships brought us here, the Oldest say—and the Family must only wait for the travelers to return. 

&gt; But young John Redlantern will break the laws of Eden, shatter the Family and change history. He will abandon the old ways, venture into the Dark...and discover the truth about their world.

&gt; Already remarkably acclaimed in the United Kingdom, Dark Eden is science fiction as literature: part parable, part powerful coming-of-age story, set in a truly original alien world of dark, sinister beauty and rendered in prose that is at once strikingly simple and stunningly inventive.",SF_Book_Club,November's SF Book is Dark [Eden] by Chris Beckett!

Each month, we post a thread where we ask users to post and vote on the book they want to read next month. It works really great, but there are a couple of annoyances I have about the way contest mode works.

I recognize that this is very specific to our little subreddit, but figured it would also get discussion from other mods on how they use contest mode. 

1. **Moderator votes count as 2 votes.** For some reason when a moderator votes on a thing, it gets counted as 2 votes while in contest mode. Once you un-contest the post, the vote counts go back to being right, but once you re-contest it, it's back to having counted for 2 votes. It's kind of an annoying bug, especially given (2) below, because we have to track which of us voted on which books.

2. **Downvotes aren't counted in contest mode, but show up when un-contested.** This might be specific to my subreddit, since it was a think I requested from the admins at the time of this change.  Downvotes are simply discarded from the vote totals when contest mode is engaged. This is as we want it, because we don't want people to downvote books they don't like. However, once I de-contest the post, the downvote totals are added to the old total. It would be really nice if those downvotes weren't added back in, so that the vote totals don't change once I make them public to the subreddit by un-contesting the thread. 

3. **The downvote button still shows up even though it doesn't count.** So users still end up downvoting into the dark. If downvotes are disabled, it'd be nice to have them disabled in the reddit-level CSS, not just subreddit-level CSS.

I have had some questions about this policy, so I want to address them and a few other questions that probably will come up in this thread.

1. Yes, it's OK for you to participate here if you're an author. In fact, we'd love for you to, you probably have a great perspective. However, you must do so as a fan and reader first. This is a forum for readers to talk about the books they love, not for authors to talk about their craft or their work. 

2. Promoting your friend's kickstarter or ebook giveaway is against the spirit of the rule. It's one thing if you want to write a nuanced review of the good and bad in their work and mention that you're a friend. It becomes another thing entirely when you're just promoting their work as a friend. 

3. If someone else mentions your work, you're more than welcome _in that conversation_ to discuss it openly, and at that point a very minimal amount of promotion of other relevant material is likely to be overlooked. 

4. We don't host AMAs, and we ask people not to link to their own AMAs. Moderators and users of other subs are perfectly welcome to post relevant AMAs here while they're happening.

5. If you'd like to promote your work on r/printSF, you can use reddit's paid advertisements to target this sub. We moderators see no money from this (or any other aspects of our moderation). 

6. If you have any questions about these policies, please reach out to us _before_ making your post. We are much more likely to be willing to work with you to ensure your content isn't in violation of our rules if you reach out to us before you post it than if we find it after you have. 

I also want to say that I totally appreciate how hard it is as a new author to get word out about your work. Hell, I've suffered my own fair share of magazine rejections and self-published stories that no one has read. These policies are nothing personal, and I promise to always be nice when removing promotional content. We all appreciate what you do. 

If anyone has further questions I'll happily answer them here and will probably copy/paste the answers into this FAQ as well.",printSF,Self Promotion is not allowed on r/printSF,https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/3l8j0l/self_promotion_is_not_allowed_on_rprintsf/

This is the first in a series of reviews of David Gerrold's **War Against the Chtorr** series. 

Some personal background: This was one of my favorite series of books in high school. My best friend and I read and re-read them. We talked about them non-stop. They managed to be both didactic and action-packed. Both spiritual and ultraviolent. Both thoughtful and sexually perverted. 

We devoured the first four books, and then tried to find book five. We couldn't find it. Finally some online searches (this was just as Google was becoming a thing) revealed that even though the last book had been published in the early 90s, none had been published since. 

I've been waiting ever since, over a decade now, for the fifth book to come out. Recently, Gerrold (who is still a working author) announced that he'd finally worked through the problem that had been keeping him from publishing the fifth book in the series, and expected to finish it by September and have it published in the next year.

I went on Amazon that day and bought used copies of all the old books (they're out of print and haven't been released as ebooks). Now I'm re-reading them for the first time since high school, and going to review each book here to document that process. It's been special, as the books really do hold up to my memory of them. I've forgotten enough of the details that it feels like I'm reading them for the first time, a second time. It's a wonderful feeling, one I wanted to share with the fine folks at r/printSF.

So with no further ado, here's the review of the first book in the War Against the Chtorr series.

#A Matter for Men
## There be spoilers below. You have been warned.

The world is in the process of dying. 

A few years ago, a series of plagues rolled through civilization, all but destroying humanity. Estimates are that 50 to 90% of the human race perished.

Man rebuilds. But as he does, he realizes that he is no longer on the top of the food chain.

For while we were battling the plagues, another menace came to Earth. The worms. Large maneating alien creatures. They are hunting us. They are trying to extinguish all human life.

It's a war, and the worms are winning.

---

_A Matter for Men_ follows the trails of Jim McCarthy, a man in his early twenties trying to navigate this new world. As the book starts, we learn that he's been newly drafted into a Special Services unit in the military, and is currently on his first mission to find some worms. We follow him through the mission, where he makes some surprising scientific discoveries about the worms' ecology. 

These chapters are pretty fun and more than a little terrifying. Gerrold is good at writing suspensefully about the mission to kill some worms. In addition, many of the characters find themselves in situations where they have to do horrific things. Duke, the mission leader and stand-in father figure for Jim, at one point has to put a young girl out of her misery, and then Jim has to do the same for one of his friends who is being eaten by one of the worms. 

This is a common theme of the entire series, that people put in bad situations will have to make choices that would otherwise be morally abhorrent, but that constantly making these choices has a very bad effect on their state of mind. We watch Jim grapple with his decision to burn Shorty along with the worm for the rest of the book, while on the other hand Duke's decision to kill the little girl is something he doesn't dwell on. In that, we see a picture of the man that Jim will grow to be—an effective leader who gets the job done, but has lost some of his humanity in the process.

After the mission, the book then changes tone. Jim and his friend Ted are sent to a scientific conference in Denver (the new post-apocalypse US Capital) with the samples Jim collected on the mission. What follows is a series of political, social, and sexual misadventures involving the two young men. We get to learn more about the political situation in the new world, as well as more about the worms and the ecology that they are a part of. For it turns out that the worms are far from alone—the Earth isn't just being invaded, it's being xenoformed by an alien ecology. 

This portion of the book is somewhat jumpy. Gerrold's publisher required major edits, and at times they show. He was forced to remove a lot of material about the worms' biology. He also had to remove a gay sex scene between Jim and Ted. This leads to confusion in later books, when Jim refers explicitly to the scene that was cut. There is an uncut version of the book that was published in the late 80s, but I've never been able to get my hands on it, so my knowledge of the differences between the two versions comes second hand from those who have read it. (Thanks to u/shojobat below, who pointed out that the unabridged editions of the first and second books are available cheaply at http://abebookscom.)

The book has a large cast of characters in this middle section, many of whom will appear in later books. Amongst the most important are Elizabeth ""Lizard"" Tirelli, a hotshot helicopter pilot who Jim has a crush on, and Daniel Foreman, a zen guru hired by the US government to train its soldiers in mindfulness techniques. 

In addition, throughout the book Jim thinks back to his most impressive high school teacher, who taught a socratic course about civil responsibility. These chapters have a very Heinlein tone to them, although at times it seems that might be tongue in cheek. These chapters showcase why Jim thinks the way he does about leadership and personal responsibility, and the last of the chapters has a very satisfying feel to it as the teacher in Jim's head addresses him directly. He calls Jim out for relying on this imaginary character built from a teacher long dead to justify his actions, and calls out the difference between the way Jim acts (often immaturely and in a manner that hurts those around him) and the way he think he acts (always for a ""good"" internal reason and rarely trying to hurt other people). There's something hallucinatory about these episodes in a way that recalls the end of Fellini's _8 1/2_. 

The book ends with Jim back on the military team, getting ready to find and kill some more worms. He's chosen a life in the military for himself after getting into a lot of trouble in Denver, then getting out of it by being offered a spot in a semi-secret society run by an ""Uncle Ira"". He has come to terms with what he has to do in order to survive in the military, and we see him coaching along some other new recruits.

When I go to the user page of a subreddit user, I cannot see any of the posts that they've made in quarantined subreddits.

When I use toolbox ""user history"" functionality, quarantined subreddits no longer appear in a user's history.

In other words, to the outside world these users now look all prim and proper. Their user pages have been scrubbed of all their antisocial history, leaving behind only their interactions on the non-despicable parts of reddit. 

Leaving aside the reasons that this is socially problematic, practically as a moderator this is going to make my job way harder. 

Up until now, I could know that if a user was saying something racist on one of my subreddits, if they were also posting in these other subreddits that it wasn't worth my time to do anything but a quick permaban and not reply to their messages and threats over modmail.

Now it looks like they're just any old user who might have said something bad, and that I should assume that their messages are in good faith and that it's worth my time to try to educate them. Either that, or I have to opt into the quarantined subreddits (which I do not want to do, and which I'll have to do individually and with no guide to which ones I might have missed—and then the history functionality of /r/toolbox or various bots still won't work, so I'll be combing through the users' histories by hand).

I'd like to plead that you guys take a look at this UX decision and please change it. I'm 100% in favor of the quarantining of this content and the bans of the worst of it, but as it exists you've also given problem users places where they can be racist to their hearts' content, while knowing that most other users will never even be able to see that they are. That's not just wrong, it's going to make our lives as mods so much more difficult.

Conversation on Peripheral has calmed down, so I wanted to get our voting thread out in time for an August 3rd announcement.

I'd also like to highlight that as of the end of July, we'll have finished 5 full years of SF Book Club. We've never missed a month voting for, picking, and discussing a book. I'm pretty proud of what an awesome community we have here, and am always impressed by how many people read and discuss these books. We've also had some awesome authors come by to engage with our small community, which has been a really fun treat—and they've always told me afterwards that they were impressed with the quality of discussion they had here.

So anyway, everyone pat yourself on the back for 5 years well done, and let's look forward to the next 5! Also be on the lookout for a few special announcements and threads dedicated to the last 5 years of SF Book Club this month.

OK, so on to the book voting. The rules are the usual:

**Each top-level comments should only be a nomination for a particular book**, including name of author, a link (Amazon, Wiki, Goodreads, etc.) and a short description.

**Vote for a nominee by upvoting**. Express your positive or negative opinion by replying to the nomination comment. Discussion is what we're all about!

**Do not downvote nominations**. Reddit doesn't even count them. If you don't want to read a book, tell us why. We'll listen.

About a week after this is posted, the mods will select the book with the most upvote, minus the upvotes on any comments against reading that book.

114,2015-07-24 23:13:34+00:00,self.bodyweightfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3ei4hm/hip_mobility/,,"So recently the scapular shrugs were added to the recommended routine. I do a combination of weighted and bodyweight training, and found these to be incredibly helpful all around. After just a couple of weeks my shoulders could move a lot further that before, and I have a lot more control over my shoulder blades when I think about them. It's helped on my squats, overhead press and bench press in addition to my bodyweight work and general posture.

So I was wondering if there's anything like that for my hips? I do my front and side leg swings every workout, but I don't feel like they're doing much over the long term. They open up my hips a little for that workout, but I haven't seen improvement since I started doing them.

So I'm wondering if there's anything more I can be doing for my hip mobility. Particularly my left leg's side-to-side movements in my hip are really constrained. Now, I can squat ass to grass and hold a third world squat no problem, but I can kind of feel the hip issues in my everyday life. Hiking, especially downhill, I'll favor my right leg a lot which bangs up that knee more than it needs to be, and cross-legged meditation will sometimes lead to really bad deadlegs because I can't get my knees all the way to the ground to support myself, so all the weight sits on my butt nerves.

The one request I'll make is that we keep this discussion in good faith. I've seen a lot of name calling and arguing in bad faith in this sub already. Let's please just assume that any time someone disagrees with you, it's not because they're a terrible person, but because they're looking at the problem from a different perspective. Try to understand that perspective, you might learn something—even if it's just that their perspective is shit and their ideas are shit. But at least you _know_ that now, instead of just having a knee-jerk reaction to someone disagreeing with you. Don't try to ""win"" an argument by getting the most upvotes, please try to understand why other people are disagreeing with you. We'll all come out a lot smarter for it, and the admins will have that much more information to take action on.

# The Problem(s)

There are a fair number of issues that seem to come up around brigading. Some of them I have dealt with myself, some of them I don't really understand or agree with at a gut level. But I want to include as many of them as I can here. I will be updating this list as comments below describe new ones.

1. **Brigading upsets the normal balance of a sub.** 

  This to me seems like the big one. When users brigade from one sub to another, those from the brigading sub usually have no idea about the brigaded sub's rules or culture. Wether through malice, apathy, or ignorance, they will likely break the rules of the sub. This is particularly beguiling on smaller subs, because it doesn't take a very large brigade to not only affect the brigaded threads, but to even change the front page of the sub for a while. 

  This is bad because the culture of a sub is something we moderators work hard to maintain, and a brigade can undo a lot of that. Particularly, it can cause a lot of rule-breaking comments and threads to be upvoted, signaling to others that those kinds of comments/threads are OK to have. I've had this issue with our ""be civil"" rule—uncivil conversations will be brigaded, and we'll just have a general uptick of incivility on the sub for a while.

2. **The admins are not clear on what is brigading or not.** 

  I'll admit that this is something that doesn't bother me, so I'll ask for clarification on my description. 

  It seems that people want clarity on exactly what brigading is—I assume so that they can avoid doing it? Please enlighten me and I'll copy/paste comments here.

  I think maybe people also feel like they don't know when to go to the admins about brigading, because they're not even sure if they're being brigaded or not.

3. **When mopping up brigading, we mods are more likely to get harassments and threats.**

  I don't know if I've seen this articulated explicitly, but it seems to be a constant undercurrent to the discussions we have about it. I noticed that u/spez in particular seemed to be surprised by the amount of harassment we mods get in his AMA, and brigading definitely causes more harassment. Speculatively, I think it's coupled to issue (1), where the brigaders come in expecting different social mores than the ones that they find, and then get upset if/when their comments are removed and they're banned for them.

4. **Brigading is not a personal issue, it's a sub issue. But we can only deal with it at the personal level.**

  This is usually described as ""our tools for moderating brigades suck"", but I'm interested in _why_ they suck.

  This is where my own opinion comes into play, so give me a second to describe what I mean. The issue with brigading is almost never that any individual poster is coming to our sub, it's that they're being sent _en masse_ by another subreddit. However, as moderators the only tools that we have available to deal with this brigading is to remove individual comments and to ban new problem users. 

  These tools address some (but not all) of the symptoms, and do _nothing_ do address the actual causes. The cause is not the individuals, it's the community they are a part of. The individuals can very much be _the problem_, but they aren't the source of the problem, so dealing with individuals will always be ineffectual at achieving our larger goals.


#Types of Brigades

Brigading subs come in different forms, and the fact that they do makes finding any one solution to the above problems rather difficult.  However, there are different types of subs that do this, and the way to deal with them might actually be different. I'm going to classify the ones I can think of and give examples, but I'm sure other people will have more.

My goal is not to shut down any of these subreddits or even say they're bad. I just want to be open and honest about the ways in which different subs brigade. 

1.  **Drama Subs.** SRD, SRS, r/Drama, etc.. These are subs that will link to any other sub in order to discuss what they see as negative and entertaining threads on those subs. These have a lot of subscribers, and even though people are told not to brigade they do. The other key issue is that these subs are almost 100% links to other subreddits.

2.  **Positive Subs.** BestOf, DepthHub. There are probably more, but I don't know of them. r/BestOf is one of the worst brigading subs on the site. The issue twofold: (1) the link to content regardless of whether it follows the rules of the sub they're linking to, and send upvotes their way, and (2) the users will often comment and vote throughout the thread and even the subreddit, further skewing things. This includes downvotes for people who disagree with the bestof'd comment. 

  BestOf has a blacklist that any sub can ask to be put on. This mitigates the effects of their brigades for those who don't want to be a part of them. On the other hand, BestOf is huge and can have a massive impact on a small sub, lasting for days, once they arrive.

3. **Issue subs.** KotakuInAction, PCMasterRace, r/Bitcoin, etc.. These are subs that have a particular agenda or topic that they discuss a lot, and most of their posts are not posts to elsewhere in reddit, but rather links to articles and self posts. However, they do regularly also link to elsewhere on reddit, often with either an explicit of (more frequently) a veiled call to action to engaged in the thread they link to. They are not ""meta"" subs, but they do happen to frequently engage in brigading, usually because the users are so passionate about the issue they support. They may be larger or smaller than the subs they link to, and that might effect how they're seen on those subs when they show up. 

  Some of these subs are great communities that just happen to get overzealous. Others are cesspits of harassment just waiting to happen. In my experience, even the ""good"" subs in this category lead to the largest number of threats and harassment to myself when I moderate the brigading content. 

4.  **Watcher subs.** GamerGhazi, BadPhilosophy, Buttcoin, TheBluePill, SRSsucks, BadHistory, etc.. These subs look a lot like issue subs, in that they usually have some topic that they discuss in addition to linking to other subs. However, unlike issue subs they don't link around whenever they find that topic, but rather they usually focus on the goings-on of one or two particular subreddits. They will link frequently to those subreddits, discuss those subreddits' posts in depth, and many times the subscribers were originally subscribers of the focused subreddit and engage equally in both subs. They are almost always much smaller than the sub that they focus on, but depending on how active the users are they can have a big effect on the posts that they do link to.

  Some of these subs might exist more or less with the blessing of the subs that they focus on. Others are tolerated as a healthy part of the reddit ecosystem, keeping either from being too much of a circle jerk. Others have an incredibly antagonistic relationship with the users and/or mods.

5.  **Sub subs.** These are subs that post other subs with the expressed blessing of the sub being posted. r/SubredditOfTheDay is what springs to mind first. As is the whole trending subs thing. I bring these up because by some definitions they might technically brigade, but I think that any solution to this problem should allow them to exist as they do.

6. **One-off brigades.** Some subs almost never brigade, but on the very rare occasion (like once a year) someone will post a thread to elsewhere on reddit. These threads might be relevant and welcomes by both communities, or might be harmful to the brigaded sub. However, this isn't a systematic issue, it's a single event to be dealt with as such. I'm not going to focus on this in my solutions.

7. **Splinter subs.** Subreddits that broke off from a large one, but whose members still may participate in the larger one. As u/FatZombieMama says:

&gt;I mod a splinter sub of people who disliked what a large sub on the same topic was doing. Our users now get accused of brigading if they go back to the larger sub. Some have been inappropriate. Some have been good contributors. All were/are subscribed to the larger sub initially. Rather than have our sub threatened, I would love to tell the users what behavior will get them in trouble so at least the large sub can see we are trying and will quit trying to get us deleted.


As I think about it, it's really (1) – (4) that are the systematic problems that we need to address here. I'd love input on this though, just make sure you define what you're actually talking about. Also open to including new categories here.

#My Proposed Solution

OK, so I don't actually think that the solution here is more tools for subreddit moderators. I think that instead, Reddit (the company) needs to change their stance on how they (don't) define brigading, and how they deal with subreddits that are accused of brigading.

Pretty much, brigading is not a technology problem, it's a political problem, and needs to be solved with better policies, not new technological tools. The tool we need already exists: automoderator blacklists on link and self posts.

**Proposal step 1**: Let subreddits define what's brigading or not. If a subreddit is fine with another subreddit posting to them, or even all subreddits posting to them, then we shouldn't punish users with shadowbans when they do. If a subreddit doesn't want anyone to link to them, then we should respect that. If a subreddit is OK with certain kinds of subs linking to them, but not others, then we should respect that. Let the subreddit mods decide what brigading means on that sub (within certain constraints set by the admins), and give them the ability to enforce those rules in some way.

**Proposal step 2**: Require blacklists on all subs of types (1) through (5) above. If a sub does not want to be linked to from SRD, then SRD should be _required_ to include that sub on a blacklist. Same goes for GamerGhazi or BestOf or KotakuInAction. If you don't want to be linked to from a sub, then you shouldn't be.

**Proposed step 2.5**: What would be really great would be to allow mods of the brigaded sub to also remove links to their sub from brigading subs. So if a user on r/DepthHub links to my subreddit, I could both remove that link _and_ add myself to the blacklist in a single click. Or with a single message to that sub's moderators, however it needs to work. This way we can end the brigading right when it starts.

**Proposed step 3**: For subs that consistently don't remove brigading links when asked, that don't have a blacklist, or won't put subs on their blacklist when asked, the admins would classify them as ""problem brigading subreddits"". They would be given an amount of time to fix up their act, and if they don't they would be banned wholesale from the site until they do fix up their act. If any of those moderators try to create a similar sub to get around the ban, those mods would be site-wide shadowbanned for attempting to go around the brigading rules. 

**Proposed step 4**: Users would be allowed to go vote and comment in linked threads with impunity. No more getting shadowbanned because SRD linked to a discussion you found interesting and joined in on. No more being worried about whether you got to an r/bitcoin thread through the front page, or from r/Buttcoin. Brigading is not a user issue, it's a subreddit issue.

**Proposed step 5**: However, if a user consistently post about a subreddit that they know has been asked to be put on blacklists, or otherwise tries to get around blacklists, then they would be shadowbanned. One person voting or commenting is not an issue, but trying to orchestrate brigades against subreddits which don't want to be linked to is.

I think that this address all 4 of the problems that I identified. It makes for fewer brigades to (1) and (3) are less of an issue, it focuses on other subreddits instead of users so (3) is less of an issue because of that, it let's us define brigading so admins don't have to, fixing (2), and it helps our tools suck less by focusing on the root of the issue, fixing (4). However, there are issues with this system that I want to address:

###Potential issues with my proposed solution

**Issue 1**: It requires a lot more work from the community management team. I actually would hope that in the long run it would cause less work for them because moderators would be encouraged to work together, but in the beginning getting everyone to use this system would be kind of a pain for sure.

**Issue 2**: Reddit admins don't like rules. I could imagine that the politics inside Reddit (the company) might make this difficult to get off the ground.

**Issue 3**: Some mods would be pissed. They don't like being told what to do. Honestly, my feeling about this is ""too bad"". If you've agreed to moderate a subreddit, you have to play by certain rules already. I don't like creating more work for myself as a moderator either, but this seems like a better solution than constantly playing cat and mouse with individual users. We already can't dox and can't harass, so why should we not also not be allowed to brigade?

**Issue 4**: This will render some subreddits all but useless. I'm particularly thinking of Sub type (4). If Buttcoin can't link to Bitcoin, then what's the point? Well, they'll have to find a way to come up with more original content, or find a way to work with the mods of Bitcoin in order to allow some links through. This will require actually talking to people and hashing out our differences. I think we can do this. And if a few small subs whose whole mission is to fuck with other subs have to go, well so be it.

**Issue 5**: Who gets to decide whether a sub it blacklisted or not? Should it be by vote of the whole mod team? By the topmost mod? What happens when one mod of r/Bitcoin asks the mods of Buttcoin to blacklist r/Bitcoin, but then another mod comes along and asks to be un-blacklisted? I think this should be up for discussion, but is absolutely an issue that can be worked through.


#Other Proposed Solutions

###Suggestion 1

u/wicro suggested:
&gt;I'd like to see official support for NP mode by Reddit, have it built into all Subreddits. Also have an option if nonsubscribers cannot vote or comment unless they subscribe. There's CSS for both, but if they were built in it would be absolutely foolproof since there's really no way to circumvent that.

and u/moikederp elaborated:
&gt;Also have an option if nonsubscribers cannot vote or comment unless they subscribe.

&gt;Even better, allow a setting ""No votes unless subscribed for X days"" and a separate ""No comments or submissions unless subscribed for X days"". You can make it zero to allow someone to jump in right away, or set it to a day to prevent 'sub, comment/vote, unsub', or more if so chosen.

&gt;It wouldn't solve issues of someone who stays subscribed to a sub only to come in and downvote posts, but it helps prevent casual drive-by brigading.

u/ashgeek had a further clarification of how they think this policy should work.

&gt;* During posting or edits, auto rewrite full reddit.com urls as NP urls
&gt;* During rendering of posts/comments auto rewrite shorthand reddit links ( /r/modsupport ) as NP urls (retaining original link as the display text)
&gt;* Sub's accessed through NP urls have all posting/voting functionality disabled (excluded from page render output, not just CSS hidden) - perhaps unless the redittor is a subscriber of the target sub and meets some defined threshold (min imum subscriber time, minimum karma level, or some other metric)
&gt;* A method to detect a user switching to non NP mode by editing the URL would probably be necessary to help enforce the rules.

&gt;Making the linking to other sub's possible but automatically converted to enforced NP rules would seem to solve a number of the potential brigadding issues. Sub's that provide a metaview of other parts of reddit can still work, but not lead to easy brigadding in a target sub. The target sub might get new subscribers who join their community in the official way, having found a new sub of interest via a link from somewhere else.

&gt;While some may say the lack of human involvement in a scheme like this is an issue, it is something where the operating rules can be well defined and understood. Others have suggested a more human-oriented approach that relies on each reddit of being aware of the specific rules of any target sub they follow a link to, and automatically penalising those who incorrectly participate in a target sub. In reality expecting most redditors to be perfect citizens of a target sub they have found through a link is not going to happen. Removing the ability to do anything but read a target sub is the least problematic approach in most cases.

&gt;If you want to get fancy, some kind of automoderator-like wiki config page could be used by a sub to define the rules a sub wants for link behavoiur tomit from other subs (default=NP, otherSub1=allowParticipation, otherSub2=denyLink). Such a configurable rules scheme is however likely to get complicated quickly.

&gt;**TL;DR - automatically enforce NP mode on any intersub links, and make a target sub read-only to a visiting non-subscriber who follows such a link. The eliminates the reliance on a redditors needing to be an expert on a target subs rules.**

###Suggestion 2

u/Grande_Yarbles suggested:
&gt;Allow mods to set a minimum karma level in each subreddit in order for votes to count. Reddit already has this info for each user so it shouldn't require a huge amount of work to implement.
&gt;Mods can set at zero to allow anyone's vote to register or ramp it up to protect against brigading and mass downvoting.
&gt;If someone was truly dedicated they could accumulate karma in target subreddits via circlejerk posts but I don't think the vast majority of people wouldn't bother.

###Suggestion 3

u/FatZombieMama suggested:
&gt;I've posted this in a number of places but here it is again. I would love to see these options in sub settings:

&gt;&gt;[yes/no] Restrict voting to users subscribed for [x] hours

&gt;&gt;[yes/no] Restrict commenting to users subscribed for [x] hours

&gt;If a sub felt they were being brigaded, they could implement. Users could then be free to link, comment, and vote where allowed, without trying to understand a murky system. Every sub has different needs, and these options would be very flexible. It's a sub-level solution that addresses individual user permissions.
