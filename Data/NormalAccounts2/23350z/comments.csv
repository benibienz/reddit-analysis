Any recommendations on travel pouches/storage solutions? I ask because I have a cute Target makeup travel bag but the brush holding section is basically on the top flap. There's a clear plastic that goes over the bristle part of the brushes but by the time I get to my destination my brushes are totally flat. As you can imagine, it really doesn't work very well to use a flattened brush for something like powder -_-

Do brush rolls prevent the flattening problem? Or maybe putting them in brush guards first? I'm one of those people who hates stickiness/makeup transfer so I haven't gone for a brush roll since I keep thinking I'll get makeup all over it and won't be able to clean it.

72,"Looks like others gave you some really good options already so I'll just mention this for your future reference (since it looks like we both like to look for a good deal). 

I got my Lorac Pro palette last year in November when Amazon (listed on Lorac's website as an official distributor) had a sale. It actually went on sale twice and the second time (around Nov 30) it was $29.40. I just tracked the price using the camelcamelcamel extension (there's both a website and a browser extension called The Camelizer) and it notified me when the price dropped. 

You might already be using it but I thought I'd mention it in case you end up looking for more makeup (or other products) on Amazon in the future. I realize you're probably not planning to wait until November or Black Friday! I'm pretty sure some helpful users posted here when they saw the price drop as well so you might not even need the extension.

I've had my eye on some of their funny-shaped ones (like the flower brush or the NTT Docomo mushroom)!",2016-03-23 18:35:14+00:00,d1aspo6,1,t3_4bnecg,5226,MakeupAddiction
98,"I use this mascara too, and can confirm the holding power. The only mascara I've ever tried that is even more cement-like than this is the Majolica Majorca Lash Expander (but it doesn't really give you volume...it has fibers that add length). Every other mascara I've used just removes my curl and/or migrates to my undereye. ",2016-03-23 06:42:30+00:00,d1a7f77,2,t1_d1a2o1s,10343,MakeupAddiction
