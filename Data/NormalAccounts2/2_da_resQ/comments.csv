32,"p.s. if youre really looking to up your game with women, check out RSD Tyler on youtube. Im a junior in vollege, 20yr old. I came with having had no girlfriends, negative self image etc and with a few years of self development especially with Tyler, my life has changed. I meet new people almost daily, enjoy parties with many fun people, and my eyes have been opened up to the hookup culture as well!",2016-01-25 20:17:04+00:00,czbm5rf,2,t1_czbm0oh,195,confidence
33,"Hey! Sounds like you have situatuonal confidence. This is confidence when youre doing something youre comfortable with, with people you may already be familiar with.

Now, situational confidence is no bad thing, in fact youd probably  want to build it around you with people and activity you enjoy. Once those things are no longer there, those aspscts will leave you without much confidence. Imagine the boss of a firm who is confident in leading his team but would feel anxiety at a club.

So, what you need to work on is core confidence. The confidence you have in yourself and your abilities. This will translate to all aspects of your life and you will feel more at ease. You will also be able to build situational confidence better. I hope that is what you were trying to find in yourself.

Check out The Six Pillars of Self Esteem. I could go on about all the stuff you do to raise your perspective on self efficacy and self respect to have a healthy self esteem as that really is a journey that I have been taking through the last 3 years (those 3 years have made a huge difference) but he probably does it far better than me.

Good luck friend!

As for quick fixes, be proactive about building situational confidence. Take friends along to the parties. Get comfortable talking to people so that socializing in high energy environments isnt a big deal and so on...",2016-01-25 20:13:49+00:00,czbm0oh,1,t3_42n9bt,2035,confidence

40,"[Here's](http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/) a pretty interesting article on the ambiguity of what constitutes a rape/sexual assault. I think there would be a lot of unnecessary consequences if inebriated (but not blacked out, unconscious, or out of control sex) constituted rape/sexual assault.

Especially imagine the damage it could do to someone's entire life for a relatively normal social behavior and even the lasting shame that can come with false charges.

I'm not saying sexual assault is a norm haha but rather drunken debauchery ;]",2015-11-04 01:39:04+00:00,cwnmvi8,1,t3_3rff35,3711,berkeley
