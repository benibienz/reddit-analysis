This is a segment of my logo. It was 72 pixels per inch and grainy so I changed it to 300in order to find some way of making its edges cleaner. I've tried blurring to no avail. It is 15in tall and 5 inches wide.

What steps should I take so that I can print it out a foot tall without it looking grainy?",photoshop,I have a very grainy Logo! How do I make its edges sharper?,https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/5al4aq/i_have_a_very_grainy_logo_how_do_i_make_its_edges/

&gt; Hi there,

&gt;Repost has officially launched its VEVO Beta program. This means YES, we can set you up with your very own VEVO channel on YouTube. Benefits of joining the VEVO network include:

&gt;Potentially higher CPMs ($$$) than on regular YouTube.

&gt;Content availability on Vevo.com and their mobile apps.

&gt;Syndication to their partners which include airlines, stores, television, and more. 

&gt;A more professional look as an artist.

&gt;It should be noted that Repost artists will not be able to ""log in"" to their VEVO channel(s) and all uploads will have to be managed by Repost. Because of this, we will be charging a one-time setup fee of $50 in order to get started.

&gt;We pride ourselves on building tools for the platforms artists, labels, and promoter channels care the most about. While a self service app is coming, we encourage you to get started now and to take advantage of this worthwhile opportunity. 

I'm not too sure how VEVO works and I've done a bit of research and while I'm inclined towards working with vevo, I'm still not 100% percent sure if this is legitimate right now.",WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Hey guys, I was just asked in an email to join VEVO.

It must be!

For what can as intensely apprehend the heart,

than that which it has condemned?

....

Emotions betrayed truth,

and what was true could not soothe,

the ephemeral pain,

naively produced,

reduced by youth.

....

She quoted Kerouac,

not in words,

but with her act.

In the sweetest sound of rage,

turned the page,

left the stage.

He stood, in awe,

eyes beauty saw,

stride out the door,

shoes slam the floor,

becomes no more -

could not mend..",Poems,Morning Mourn.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/4ooai9/morning_mourn/

I took one around 5pm, didnt really feed anything and didnt really expect to, 

took two at around 11 and another within 10 minutes. 

Throughout the night, I took it two at a time twice more in pretty regular intervals, the last one being at around 4 or 5 am.

 It's 2:30 pm now where I am and I have an exam coming up. I havent had any sleep but not really tired yet feeling a bit less sharp. I do NOT want to have a comedown during the exam haha

Will taking my last two tablets help? The only side effects Ive felt so far is faster heartbeat, fidgety, and getting goosebumps lol. I've had previous experience and 60 mg XR ,which I crushed and snorted, was my highest previous dosage.

Can you guys enlighten me?
