2800,"200 pounds is like 300 dollars right?
So you have two paths.

Closed and Open back headphones.

Closed usually has more bass but lacks soundstage compared to open back headphones, and isolates sound from the outside so you can't hear the environment to a certain extent.

Open usually has less bass (with few exceptions being planar and fidelios) and more soundstage. However it leaks noise and people around you can hear you.

For a closed back choice, if you can extend your budget to 260 pounds you can get the oppo pm3 planar which is excellent for what you listen to, is portable and is planar magnetic. This gives you an unrivalled bass response and extention. 

For a little cheaper you can get the Maddogs/maddogs pro with a cheap amp. This isn't portable but the maddogs pro are excellent for you, however they are a bit pricy and may require an amp to drive them to higher volumes.


For an open back headphones where you don't need isolation or need to worry about sound leakage, you can go for the new hifiman he400S which you can order from Electromod. These are reportedly very efficient and you do not need an amp. 

There may be better options but that is up to you to explore and decide. Good luck! Don't hesitate to ask more questions if you want! (Especially about these audiophile words)",2015-07-23 17:13:33+00:00,ctdjrko,2.0,t1_ctdircv,1443.0,headphones

Jokes aside, m50x isn't your best bet. For music production you would want to hear everything so neutral would be best, such as AKG K5XX series (xx stand for numbers), or if you don't need isolation, and you want an open back, go for akg k612 with an o2 amp that will be on massdrop tmrw.

Neutral is your best bet as you are making music. Take what I and everyone else has to say with a grain of salt as it's you who is buying and you shouldn't regret your own purchase.",2015-07-23 17:03:02+00:00,ctdjbza,2.0,t1_ctdha0p,2973.0,headphones

2881,"I play csgo myself. This is a really simple explaination. Amos make your heaphone louder if they need more power to run them. If your onboard audio isnt good enough, or your headphones need more power (this is shown in ohms and sensitivity, usually higher the number, the more power needed) you should get an amo.

Dacs are digital to analog converters. You only absolutely need it if you have hissing noises.

Closed headphones block out noise and keep noise inside, increasing bass response and giving you isolation at the cost of soundstage. Soundstage is how well you can imagine the audio like if a gun goes off you can point out the direction.

Open headphones however, leak noise but gives it a natural sound which gives soundstage. Usually these openbacks dont have a lot of bass with a few exceptions such as the fidelio x2s. These are what are considered better for gaming as long your room mate or family dont mind the noise.

For gaming I would suggest the akgq701 , fidelio x2 . For the akg q701 you might need an amo to drive it to higher volumes. I got a q701 and fiioe10k for music and csgo and i am loving it. If you have any questions send em my way :)
