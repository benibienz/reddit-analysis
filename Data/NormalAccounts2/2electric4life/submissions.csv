From 16 years old I always had acne.

Here are the major things I give credit to on being acne-free.

1.  Wash and wash my hands... after taking a number 2!&lt;-- and after eating.

2.  Rinse my mouth with water after every time I eat, drink, or brush my teeth.

3.  Rinse and rinse after brushing teeth.  I learned I was allergic to fluoride and another tooth whitening substance. 

4. NEVER TOUCH FACE.  Even when showering.  I only use exfoliating gloves.  And in public I use tissues. 

4. STOP TAKING BLOOD thinning medications. ( ex. Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin.)   Also, any other  ""supplement"" that you really don't need.  
If you are pregnant, or have a disease take one you need.

5. Lastly: ""air out"", dry, fan, evaporate, dehydrate,  your living area once a week. 
Mold can be a huge problem. 
I didn't realize how much humidity a shower a day can really dampen things.

Some out of luck and some because they go and get it. 

This post is meant to hopefully open eyes to those wanting to get a job without expending time and money to go to school.  

After receiving my bachelors in Business Administration emphasis in Finance I quickly realized that the business administration part is an overview of... Accounting, finance, marketing, and management.  Confidently,  I can say if I were offered a position in any of these fields I could ""learn"" the position.

But! An employer wants you to be specific. Accounting major, marketing major, etc.  In my case Finance.  After being in the industry for a few years i thought to myself, what's next?  

An MBA!! 

No no no no, I want to emphasis the MBA part because of two words.  Business Administration. Again, an over glorified degree overview of accounting, finance, and marketing.  

Don't get me wrong... An MBA isn't easy to obtain, and you do have to work for it, but a Director of Overstock.com once told me; he didn't like his MBA program because all they taught him was to start a business...

Right there my outlook changed.  Why pay thousands for school to just pay thousands to start a business?   

Starting a Business that creates some sort of sales on a financial ledger,in my opinion, is beyond better than a MBA and a Business Degree.

This leads to Technology field and could apply anywhere else.  If you want to become a software engineer or programmer... {Start a business} in other words start a program, start a website, start a game, start a video.  Hell! Maybe you will actually start your own business out of luck or aspiration. 

In this day and age, you can build or start anything I said previously by going online and doing tutorials or watching videos. 

For other jobs like becoming a doctor you may need schooling,  but you can always get certification if applicable for the job.
