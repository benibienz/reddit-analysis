0,"On my result, democratic party candidate came on top of the list on both presidental as well as senator list. How is order determined ? (? round robin, random ?)

I have not seen the actual polling slip or electronic machine. How are ordered determined there. I know for countries like india where along with printed name, a symbol is used for candidates. For some demographics, the nature of symbol as well as their placement on the vote sheet has considerable influence.

1,"It is normal. They either have to wait for the next move, which might take forever. Or pick up the thesis and complete it even if the actual game has progressed further in different direction. Usually, the sequence of moves are related and they do not need to cover each move, allowing them to cover the latest state of the actual game at once.

2,"Low/Zero abstraction cost with python's syntax and batteries are ideal thing to have. I would love to see elaboration on trade-offs, omission and additions.

Like other have mentioned, your major hurdle would be legacy cython based codes including numpy if you are aiming for compatibility. I am not sure how much of gain we are looking with the libpython on the back.

If you were to borrow only the syntax and the std libraries and replace cython with your own FFI, you might want to survey the third party libraries to see how hard it is to create a seed ecosystem. As long as they are pure python they should not be a problem. (https://pypi.python.org/simple/). At worst it will not have numpy classes of libraries, but will get you majority of other libs, takes away GIL and may allow new language features like Microthreads, Threading primitives, Lightweight Collections etc.

You might also want to look at nim-lang, rust for their zero abstraction cost, julia, elixir.

I looked into it and ended up with a cluster of 8 dual E5-2670 nodes of quanta servers with 100gb ddr3 on each node. 10GbE networking was a added bonus.

Cost me about 3K.
