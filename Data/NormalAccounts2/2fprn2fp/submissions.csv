None of the creditors on the report have my SSN. I have changed the address for about 1.5 years.

1. Valid wells fargo charge off on secure card, charge off was paid before ssn was issued. Became aware of the issue while trying to open a checking account at new location. Comes off as ""Charge off - paid in full"". Any way to remove it all together. I had my passport expired, and was refused on branch from using my other accounts, if it helps.

2. BOA Charge Off for $44.00. My checking account was closed by BOA from their side about 2 years ago. Went to branch, they could not tell the reason. Asked the banker to clear the balance and close the account. Banker gave me balance to pay. Paid full in counter. Either the banker gave incorrect info, or they did not close it properly. I have opened investigation with BOA. I don't mind paying $44.00 or more to get it gone completely.

3. MRS BPO LLC, for Times Warner Cable. Collection for $233.00. I had service with times warner in old address. Got the service using online and registration. Pretty sure called and disconnected before moving out, do not have paper works or confirmation number for disconnection. They had a card on file, service was about $60 a month. Have not called the collection agency to avoid admitting any debt. Wont mind paying $233.00 to get the record gone from report, but would like to dispute if it is better.


Is it a wise idea to dispute old address and all history before the date the SSN was issued directly to Agencies. Agencies have old addresses, and experian shows current address from well's fargo.

On positive side got approved for secure card from Capital one, deposited $3K and waiting for the card.

Sorry for the long post. I will sincerely appreciate any help and pointers.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

My plan is to start with above setup, and add one more GTX 1070 later on as well as 64GB again.

I am not sure whether i need 40 Lanes Motherboard/Processor for two GPU and NVMe ssd.

I am willing to wait 2-3 months or untill 1070 is back in stock, and add 1500.00 on budget if there are any new alternatives releasing soon.
