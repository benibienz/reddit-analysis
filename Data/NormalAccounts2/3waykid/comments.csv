27,"Last night was a mess. 
Yesterday I had my first exam post concussion and it went ok so I was happy. O went over to my boyfriends house to catch up with him because I've seen him maybe twice in the last month but everyone else came over too so I didn't actually get to see him really. Everyone decided to have a few drinks (rip still cant) which was fine until we decided to go let off some fireworks. On the way there one of the cars had an extra passenger, wasn't registered and was being driven by someone on their restricted (i was not in this car) and my dumbass boyfriend thought it was a good idea to let off a firework out the window of the car. Mean. Girl thats driving gets really upset. Mean. I tell him later that he needs to apologise in the morning and he gets pissy about it. Mean.

Lighting fireworks, super fun, going good. Two of the boys decide to run out on the field so they can stand under the sparks. Everyone starts aiming a bit above their heads so they can do so. One of the boys, in his drunkenness decides to point them directly at them. Boy gets hit in the face. Goes to hospital to get stitches because his lip has split (no burns thank god). Boy that hit other boy with fireworks decides he wants to go swimming and gets pissed when I don't let him. ""Not even drunk, only halfway through the goon"" (= 10 beers in 2 hours) 

I get pissed because I'm a lifeguard. All the people I deal with that have injured themselves have been drunk. I tell him this. He still thinks its a good idea. Get told I'm a phsyco over bearing woman. Toss up walking home. Pull the pin on the whole thing and make everyone go home. 

Get home and can't sleep bc of this fucking concussion.

I discovered I was unable to take the mini pill due to developing severe depression within days of begining. On the other mini offered in my country I ecoerienced anxiety (fun times) so what I would do is ask a close friend to keep an eye on your mood or demenor for the few weeks after switching to make sure everything is a ok. This is important bc its hard to pick up on your own, I only noticed bc I missed a day. If you have anyone say to you ""oh hey you seem a bit off"" or whatever take it into consideration that it could be the pill.

59,"Yeah I feel like the culture surrounding beauty and purchasing is quite different in the US rather than NZ. Whilst christmas is an important holiday here, the sales are really no different to any other time of year. In addition there is much more market competitiveness in the US so sales are bigger and better, coupled with lower prices all round. 

There's even differences in the perceived value of make up, for us drugstore make up = mid range to high end. Drug stores are the places that have the counters and where you would go to get your make up done. Instead places like kmart and the wharehouse (like target) are where you go to get cheap affordable make up and skin care. Because of the difference in structure there is no need/incentive to wait for holiday sales because aside from boxing day, its not different from any other time of year

However what this does mean is that I see a lot more random purchasing than those in the US because you have an incentive to wait, plan and then purchase whereas we don't so much.

108,"I'll just say now that i love essence to death as you will see! I am olive in colouring and just begining to get a tan so my skin has gone up a shade from winter. My skin is hella dry (except my eyes?! Oilslicks) 
Face: Nivea light moisturizing day cream. I slather this on before primer and it gets rid of all my dry spots with out making my face greasy 10/10 
La girl pro prep: I quite like this, not as much as my smashbox primer but its a cheep alternative amd it does a good job of sorting out my nose pores and eye creases. 7/10 
Essence all about matt powder SO GREAT. Does a fantastic job setting the primer under my eyes and my foundation without drying it out to much. Really good at controlling oil on a hot day, would probably be the one thing i would consistantly carry. 
Foundation: essence soft touch mousse in matt sand. This foundation is not for ~pale princesses~ I'm the second lightest shade. Has pretty decent coverage but can be a lil drying.
Klean colour blush in chai, my hg blush (light hand needed) 
Contour: i used the darkest brown shade from the smashbox on the rocks mega pallete. Its the perfect cool toned brown thats actually dark enough to show on my skin, also its never ending? I am yet to hit pan. Bronzer: colourpop in the shade carry on. Like a lot but sometimes would like a lil shimmer instead of matte but its easy to use and works well on my skin. 
Highlight: essence single shadow in apricotta. Provides a nice natural sheen without blinding, long lasting and buildable. 
Eyebrows: random brown shade from morphe 35t pallete. Works well for what it is.
Essence eyeliner pen to tightline. Easy to use, dries quickly and is pigmented too",2016-10-20 08:56:20+00:00,d902tq0,1.0,t3_58a19v,73014,muacjdiscussion
