At the moment within the beauty community there seems to be a massive drive to have and own every single thing even if there is no real need or want. I guess my issue is with purchasing for the sake of purchasing without putting thought behind it. Not only do I feel this is super wasteful but also super unnecessary. This was super apparent with the ulta sale, I feel like lots of people were making purchases for the sake of the sale rather than to get deals on items they have wanted for a while or have put thought into purchasing. 

I would love to hear others thoughts on this issue and would like to note that I have no issue with those that like to have full collections. Instead what concerns me is consumption for the sake of it. I would really like to hear from people from other countries too, as I feel like this is not so much of an issue where I live for various reasons. These include strict return policies, prices and poor rewards programs. 

I would like to hear everyones thoughts on whether its an issue where you live, what your perceptions are surrounding the issue in other places like the US or NZ (hola) and finally, what can be done about it!

P.s. no shade thrown at those with massive collections or those that like to collect make up! 

Edit: got ride of some of the bitchiness. I think some of my feelings towards this topic realte to the realitive scarcity of quality cosmetics where I live compared to places like the US or even Aus sometimes",muacjdiscussion,Issues with over consumption,https://www.reddit.com/r/muacjdiscussion/comments/5a5lvo/issues_with_over_consumption/

My hair is roughly a 3a curl and I'm currently trying to grow it out. However the ends are getting a lil gross so its in need of a cut. Normally I would straighten my haor and get it cut straight across the bottom. This worked fine when my hair was shorter but I worry that as it gets longer the curls are getting weighed down by the length and bulk of hair surrounding it. I'm a bit scared from last time i got it cut because the hair dresser used thining scissors ""to get rid of the bulk"" aka most of my hair. What can I do to make sure this doesn't happen?

Anyway, just got my Shape Tape in the mail and I'm super excited. I have a few q's though. I'm unfortunately not using it to contour, because I am a ~ppp~ so it is to dark for that!  just as a concealer since it apparently is a god-send (so my boyfies tell me) 

Is it okay to just use as a concealer and not for contouring? Also, how do I now incorporate it into my makeup routine?

My routine is as follows; Moistourize and then apply primer. Use better skin concealer by maybelline to cover any blemishes and red spots. Then I usually use FitMe liquid foundation infused with gold and diamonds (I'm trying to find something better for oily skin, if you've got any suggestions let a girl know!) Then I'll usually set it lightly with either Tartes powder or with L'Or√©al pressed powder (also infused with diamonds just fyi, can't have something the poors use touch my skin!) . THEN I'll set it more with some Laura Mercer Translucent Powder.

Can I just use the Shape Tape in place of the Better skin concealer? Anyone have any tips or suggestions when it comes to Shape Tape?",muacirclejerk,"Just got Tarte Shape Tape in the mail, need some advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/muacirclejerk/comments/59laub/just_got_tarte_shape_tape_in_the_mail_need_some/
