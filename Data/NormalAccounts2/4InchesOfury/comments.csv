You start out with the Mazda MX5, the Pontiac Solstice, Cadillac CTS-V, and the Spec Racer Ford. 

The MX5 and Pontiac Solstice run in Rookie series', which are entirely made up of free content. 

The tracks that are free and used are:

&gt;Okayama, Summit Point, Charlotte Roval, Lime Rock, Laguna Seca, Phoenix Roval, Daytona Roval

The tracks being used in the series change at the start of every week. 

The MX5 series will honestly keep you occupied for a full season (12 weeks), if not more. It will give you a good idea of if you enjoy it enough to buy content for the higher series. 

In rookies there is a race every hour, and they all go official (meaning that enough people join the race for it to count). You'll have no issue with Australian participation in the popular series (Blancpain, etc). 

There are some series that are less popular (Lotus 49/79 for example) which have a few scheduled races each week that go official. ",2016-01-15 04:37:56+00:00,cyyux97,1,t3_411coy,2876,iRacing

&gt;7.1.1.4. Blocking - The defending driver is allowed to run a defensive line through a corner and onto the straight. For iRacing, blocking is a deviation by a driver from defending position based on the action of the pursuing driver

You can always run a defensive line, but let's say midway on the Kemmel Straight you're behind someone who's on the outside. You pull to the inside, they see you do that and also pull to the inside. You then go to the outside, the driver you're following stays on the inside. iRacing considers that blocking by the lead driver. If they had started to run the defensive line at the start of the straight, it would be fine, but because they did it in response to the move it's blocking. 

That type of move (at least in instances where it forces the following driver to lift or crash) is successfully protestable in my experience.

Not sure if the rules are different in the Pro series or anything, but that's how it works in the lower series. ",2016-01-14 02:30:46+00:00,cyxgas5,4,t1_cyxfeg3,1517,iRacing

336,"Hey guys, so global chat *probably* won't be coming back if we can get local to work as we intend. That means a larger range, attack decs being handled through a plugin (already in the works), and maybe a few more tweaks. 

We won't be able to do a faction-land based local chat. We might be able to do a badlands based chat. 

----

We have some things in the works that would help new players learn the ropes and a new way that we're going to be integrating the server/forum together. 

----

On a personal note, the degradation of global chat has been one of my biggest failings as an admin. One of the biggest draws of Rust Factions to me way way back in the day wasn't the RP (although I enjoyed it), but that it was the one server where the chat/community wasn't toxic. As the server has grown, the global chat had become more and more like a normal Rust server, just with the banning of certain slurs. 

Yeah, policing it more and being stricter about certain things is an option, but then comes (once again) the discussion of judgement calls. It's easy to ban slurs, it's much more difficult to define and ban ""toxic"". Many in the community still don't trust us to enforce gray-area parts of the rules, and I can't blame them for that. While I think the current admin team is the best we've ever had, the server has gone through dark periods in the past in terms of leadership.

I'm not ruling out a return to global or a hybrid global/local system but we really enjoy the attitudes that having local-only chat has been promoting on the server. ",2015-11-13 21:09:55+00:00,cwzb1tg,1,t3_3sp3tw,6080,rustfactions

I've said in the [past](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustfactions/comments/3ph44a/rustifac_town_hall_lets_have_a_chat/) that I hate that clause, and I still do. Unfortunately, it's a necessary evil that we have to have. We're here to play on an RP Rust server, not to play internet lawyer. We do try to cover as many loopholes as possible in our rules (it's why we have the rule that a faction can only *lose* one region per 12 hours, to prevent a group of factions from steamrolling a faction in a short period of time. Shorter than what you could accomplish with a single faction/announced alliance). However, we can't cover everything. It's just not feasible. The rules shouldn't be a legal book. You shouldn't have to have some designated ""lawyer"" for your faction that you need to consult before doing something. 

That clause is there so we don't have to further make the rules more convoluted. And it isn't just used as a punishment for people, it's also used as a clause for us to *not* enforce the rules in areas we see fit (for example, some recent war decs have been under 150 words but still had plenty of RP. They are within the spirit of the server, if all factions made war decs like that we wouldn't need that rule, so we allow them).

It's something we have to do because not everyone on the server wants to play nice, and people will do what they can to bend the rules to their will to gain an advantage on someone else. Like I said recently, this is an RP server, not a competitive Rust server.

This is a system we're experimenting with. We're working on getting more staff (we recently recruited new staff, and also had a few staff members quit) and we'll have more news on that soon. Unfortunately, if the KOS reports regarding banditry were simple then it wouldn't be an issue. However, it turns into this gray area where one person thinks someone is exploiting rules and another disagrees and we end up having to spend 30 minutes - 2 hours investigating a single report, trying to get both sides of the story to get an accurate ruling which 9 times out of 10 ends up with us saying ""Sorry, we can't really rule on this either way. We can't determine what actually happened because we're getting two different stories, we've given X person a warning about this kind of banditry for the future"". That leaves a sour taste in the mouth of everyone involved. While I'd love to be spectating every player on the server, we have 100+ players online usually and we have dozens of players on our watchlist. We do our best to investigate things but we can only do so much. We have many admins on our team that dedicate full-time hours to Rust Factions without pay, and we're still struggling with the load. 

Yes, restricting this type of RP for solo players is not ideal, but solo players were also the ones most responsible for the gray area banditry we were experiencing.

/u/RetroEx pretty much covered our reasons for it. The badlands aren't just a KOS zone a la the North back in the day. The badlands aren't just a split in the map, they're a split in faction attitudes, alliances, they force trade between the North/South, and have been the source of some amazing RP.
&gt;The reason for this, is that eventually most south factions will be closed off to expansion, since its densely populated with large factions

Eventually, all factions will be closed off to expansion. If we hadn't introduced the 1 claim per 12 hour rule, the map would already be full.

The badlands this era function exactly as they did last era (well, except for the increased quarry gather rates). We took a [survey](http://imgur.com/a/ldXg8) last era and the results on the Badlands were overwhelmingly positive.

540,"&gt;Difficult to earn how, though? Anyone can grab three friends, claim territory (by whatever means it happens to be), and set a KOS law. How is that ""hard""? I'm confused by that comment.

Because they can't set laws unless they clearly mark their borders, which as you said earlier is a quite a large effort to undertake. Larger the claim, the harder it is to mark it.

The current system is up to admin interpretation, and I personally like to leave as little up to interpretation as possible. For that reason, I'll be bringing this up in discussions for rule revisions for next era. 

However, I do feel it's important to note that factions enacting KOS laws are pretty rare. I believe last era we had a total of 2 factions enact them during peace time, and there was never any confusion about someone being on another factions land (though those factions had border walls, which I hope will be re-introduced soon). This era, I don't believe we've had any faction *legally* enforce KOS laws during peace time.

You're right though. That rule was introduced a long time ago when the server was much smaller, we had a much smaller map and much less factions. Reworking it to support a larger population would be in our best interest. ",2015-09-17 03:54:47+00:00,cv4cdma,5,t1_cv4c4ck,536,rustfactions
541,"The right to impose KOS laws is one that's difficult to earn, and it's like that for a reason. If someone can reasonably enter a factions land without knowing they are on that factions land through in-game means, then that faction can't enforce laws on their lands. That also means needing to maintain your borders. 

The larger a factions borders, the harder it is for them to maintain it. That's by design. 

Border walls have been temporarily discouraged because of us closing in on the collider limit. Once the collider limit is fixed (hopefully tomorrow), people will be once again free to build border walls to their hearts content.

543,"1). If the post of their laws is a month old, then it's from last era and that post isn't valid. They do not have the right to enforce laws (and subsequently KOS) on their lands. 

2) If the factions land isn't clearly marked, they are not allowed to enforce laws. This can be through having border walls or marking their borders with signs. 

Regarding your first suggestion: Factions have the right to enforce their laws how they see fit, whether it be KOSing players trespassing on their lands or removal of pants upon entry to their lands. However, the danger of having KOS on your lands is that those you fire upon have the right to fire back. We don't have plans on needing to give someone a warning before killing them on your land if your laws are clearly posted on the subreddit (for the current era) and your borders are clearly marked in-game.

3) Map wipes are monthly, BP wipes are every other month (next BP wipe is with the next map wipe). 

4) On map wipes, the entire map is changed, factions are reset, and everything starts from scratch (ideally including RP, you might be in a grudge match with another faction but after the era we hope people will start from scratch with eachother)

We've had a longstanding policy on deleting goodbye posts. It's not an attempt at ""damage control"", we're fully OK with people offering their opinions on the current state of the server (we actually point people discussing it in-game to the subreddit for this so it's easier to keep track of player feedback).

I have nothing against a faction application, I made and helped friends write whitelist applications back when those were needed. My point is that it won't do anything to fight against trolls like MFD. 

As a method of streamlining the faction process, I'd be fine with it. As of now it's not very clear how to start a new faction. You have to make a new faction, you have to make a new sovereignty post, and in the past there have been issues of people not recognizing factions if they weren't in the definitive faction list post. 

As a system of making the faction creation process clearer, both for new factions and players on the server, I support this idea. As a method of combating trolls, I don't think it'll be effective.

They forgot to make a war declaration (whether they needed one or not is up for debate which can be left up to the admins, since BOR arguably isn't an official faction). Would the outcome have changed? Were you honestly expecting anything different to happen? What are you trying to accomplish by twisting the rules? 

I don't think treating the rules like a lawyer to find any technicality you can is healthy for the server. 

Plenty of factions have been enforcing laws on their land despite not having the laws clearly listed on the subreddit or borders marked in-game. The OOC chat rule isn't being enforced at all (I'm sure you've broken this one). Tons of indies exist without offering a service for factions. I've seen multiple bases with inaccessible cabinets. Plenty of complaining about KOS/Rules has happened in chat. 

Yet, I'd say most people think the server is doing pretty well. The RP is healthy and fully within the spirit of the server and it's rules. If we want to be technical about the rules, almost everyone who plays on it should have been warned/temp-banned multiple times.

718,"I was actually planning to make a post about this as well. Here's my perspective from someone who just started out this era with no BPs as opposed to most people who had BPs carry over. 

**Pros:** 

Encourages player interaction through trade and/or meeting people on roads since you have to spend so much more time barrel farming. 

Makes the ""radtown suicide runs"" rule a part of gameplay since suicide runs are moot now. 

**Cons:**

Very difficult to get started. Took me twice as long to get basic BPs (chest/hatchet, had to trade for multiple of the raw items and spend a ton of resources failing to research and I'm still looking for someone to trade me a few picks to research). 

Barrel spawns seem low. I've already been threatened by a faction for daring to farm on a radtown that's across the map from their claim (I guess that's a plus for RP), and even then I've spent hours just running roads only to find 2-3 barrels. A lot more people are spending a lot more time barrel farming, and I imagine it would be much worse once there's an actual BP wipe.

Because of how much more time you need to invest in getting BPs (either trading, barrel farming, or gathering resources to research), BP wipes should happen much less often (every 2-3 months minimum). 

I'm not a fan of how common it makes guns. I've already gotten 5-6 guns from barrels and I'm just an indie who's been barrel farming scraps. 

----

Those are my experiences. It did encourage me to interact more with other players, but the whole time I was thinking ""Wow I hate this barrel system"". In my eyes its a trade-off between RP and gameplay. 

I'd be interested in seeing a vote towards the end of this era to gauge what the overall community thinks about it as I've tried to have some discussions about it in-game and I can't recall anyone being positive towards the current system. 

Edit: I'd also suggest making the large chest a default BP. Have to do a lot more item hoarding at the start until you can build a research table so you need a lot more storage.",2015-07-26 17:53:41+00:00,ctgulz0,1,t3_3enxss,9934,rustfactions
