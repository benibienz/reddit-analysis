&gt;iRacing.com and Eldora Speedway today announced plans to add the legendary half mile clay oval to the popular online motorsport simulation service’s catalogue of race tracks.   The world’s leading centralized racing game platform, iRacing revealed on April 1 that it plans to add dirt race tracks and racing cars to its online motorsports simulation service.
 
&gt;Founded in 1954 in Rossburg, Ohio by the late Earl Baltes, Eldora Speedway is home of The Biggest Dirt Races In The World™ -- including the World 100®, Kings Royal®, Dirt Late Model Dream®, and the Four Crown Nationals®.  Three-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Tony Stewart purchased Eldora in 2004 and has continued Baltes’ legacy with continual facility improvements, significant purse increases and the addition of a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series event, the only NASCAR National Series race held on dirt.
 
&gt;“We’re ecstatic to partner with iRacing in bringing dirt track racing to sim racers around the world,” said speedway Promoter and General Manager Roger Slack.  “Eldora has a history of firsts that have produced the biggest and best events in dirt track racing, so it’s fitting that the World’s Greatest Dirt Track® will be available on the world’s greatest sim racing service.”
 
&gt;“We’re really thrilled to be adding the world’s premier dirt track to our service,” said Tony Gardner, President of iRacing.com. “Last week’s announcement that we’re bringing dirt track racing to iRacing generated a tremendous amount of interest throughout the motorsports community, and we’re honored that we’ll be able to offer our members the opportunity to race at Eldora.”
 
&gt;Among the iRacers delighted to hear Eldora will be coming to iRacing is NASCAR Sprint Cup driver Kyle Larson.
 
&gt;“This is great news,” said Larson, who swept all three USAC divisions at the Four Crown Nationals at Eldora in 2011.  “iRacing adding dirt racing, and Eldora Speedway, is really exciting. I’ve had some fantastic races at the Big E and can’t wait to go there virtually.  As a long-time member of iRacing, I’ve offered my help as they develop dirt, so I am looking forward to contributing to the project.”

**We’re moving off of reddit and to our own forum.** This is a huge change and it doesn’t come lightly. Throughout the entire history of Rust Factions, Reddit has been used as the primary platform. Unfortunately it’s become too limiting for us. Reddit is a great simple platform for a small gaming community, but as we’ve grown we’ve had many ideas that we couldn’t implement and a distinct lack in decent moderation tools for us to manage the community successfully. Registration is based on your Steam account, simply click “Sign in through Steam” to register. All Rust Factions related posts should happen on the forum from now on. You can find it at http://factionsgaming.com/

Part of the move to the forum is that we’ll be introducing a whitelist. In the past, a whitelist application involved writing a 150 word RP post and players had to be manually added to the server (which could take up to 24 hours). **We won’t be going to that extent.**

We’re going to be introducing an automated whitelist system that only involves registering on the forum. **Once you’re registered (sign-in with your Steam account), then you’re automatically whitelisted.** This should provide a minor barrier to entry while also pointing new players to the community/rules that play a major part in the server. We’ll have a grace period of a few days after we’ve moved to the forums before we launch the whitelist portion of the new site.

We’ll be wiping this Thursday with the Rust update (not a mandatory wipe). As we stated at the start of the era, we’re only doing this as it’s absolutely necessary. Hopefully soon Rust will get to the point where it allows us to last longer than 2 weeks without having to wipe. 

**We are now taking moderator applications.** We’re looking for 2-3 moderators from any timezone, but especially EU. We’ve created an application to fill out, the contents of which will be private and shared only with the current Admin team. There are no hard requirements for age or experience, if you have a desire to help out our awesome community then send in an application. 

#[Rust Factions Moderator Application](http://goo.gl/forms/wKTB7bS0A7)

And as promised, [here are the responses](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/165z4nloaW71Uy1W2GvakRVhsZQjHcZL3XlEYQRwDhA4/viewanalytics) to the survey we did at the start of this era.

Lastly, I want to apologize for the lack of admin support this past era. The community was neglected, and it will not be happening again. 

This is a major step for Rust Factions and we’re going to continue improving with each passing era. See everyone on the [forum](http://factionsgaming.com/)!

This new update came with quite a few back-end changes. We've done our best to solve the issues but you may still encounter some bugs with server plugins. 

#BP's have wiped.

This wasn't something we were planning, but we encountered an issue during the wipe and BPs were lost. We're very sorry about this. 

#**We have a few changes we’re wanting to experiment with this era:**

We really enjoyed the dynamics that a southern badlands brought in Era 9.5, so we have decided to continue it in Era X. 

Banditry is getting a slight overhaul: 

&gt; **Only land-owning factions will be allowed to bandit.** 

We’ve been encountering an issue where almost all of the KOS reports we receive are related to banditry. A community dialogue was started last week about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustfactions/comments/3r3uum/the_current_state_of_banditry/) and we came to the conclusion that serious changes needed to be made to how banditry works on the server. Independant players and non-landowning factions will no longer be able to give commands for someone to turn over items with the threat of death if they don’t comply. This change isn’t ideal, however as banditry was being abused far too much that we feel this is currently our best option. What this means is that bandits can now be held accountable, with their base locations known on the map. We hope this will lower incidents of players joining the server and using banditry as an excuse to kill people rather than creating RP encounters. We have a few more ideas for how banditry could work in the future (think of how becoming a police officer works on Arma Life servers) but for now we will be testing out this system. 

&gt; **The text chat is now restricted to local** 


We are *experimenting* with local chat. This might last a few days, the full era, or be a permanent change. Text chat is restricted to a radius around yourself, global chat is disabled. We want to see what (if any) changes this makes to the dynamics of the server. Remember that things like trade discussion can still take place on the subreddit and on teamspeak. 

**Era Length:**

We want long eras just as much as you guys. Unfortunately, Rust just isn’t well optimized enough for us to last for a full month-long era. This isn’t an issue with a lack of server resources (CPU/RAM usage almost never goes above 50%), it’s just the Rust server client. We will *try* to have a 3 week era, however if server performance degrades too much 2 weeks in, we will be forced to wipe. 

We also have a survey we’d like the community to participate in. The survey is completely anonymous and will be used to help us make server policy in the future. The results of the multiple choice questions will be posted publicly. 

You can participate in it here: http://goo.gl/forms/2S8IiHiYMB

Radtowns should also be spread out evenly across the map, and a spread out road system is important. 

We're going to be keeping the current iteration of the Badlands for this era, however we'll be changing the North/South balance. South of the Badlands, you will only be able to extract Oil, you will not be able to extract HQM from quarries. North of the Badlands, you will be able to extract HQM from quarries as usual. This should prevent the South from becoming overpowered and self-sustaining while the North is at a disadvantage. You will not be able to gather HQM from quarries inside the Badlands.

Let's talk about recent events on the server. 

#Rule enforcement

I thought I’d outline how we decide to give out punishments. We try to have a policy of second chances (for the most part). If we didn’t, almost every faction on the server would have been banned for violating one rule or another. People make mistakes and learn from them. 

This isn’t to say that rule breakage doesn’t lead to punishments. We use a mix of verbal warnings, strikes (essentially a public warning), temporary bans, and bans. Which we use for which offense is decided on a case-by-case basis. If someone is a brand new player who has just come on the server and started KOSing people, we’ll most likely permaban them (though bans are open to appeal). If a long-time player KOS’ someone because they’re on the edge of a KOS zone and made a mistake, they will likely receive a verbal warning. When factions have illegally raided other factions due to misunderstandings about the rules, we have given warnings/strikes (depending on the severity). In cases where there were repeat offenses, temp bans were handed out. While I don’t like leaving things like this up to interpretation (I’d like as little admin interpretation of rules/enforcement as possible, it should all be clearly defined), a cookie cutter approach to penalties just isn’t viable. 

We’ve had suggestions about using in-game item penalties. I’m really not a fan of this. It would be difficult to make it consistent and to have the same kind of penalty across indies/small-large factions. Another suggestion we’ve had is to use temp bans more liberally. That’s something we probably should do. 

I feel it’s important to clarify that we prefer the punishments for rule breaking to be used as a way of preventing further rule violations, not as a way of enacting justice/vengeance. Many of our top contributing factions have started out with violating the server rules (including factions like BARBAR). Enacting harsher punishments might have meant that they never would have had the chance to start out and get the chance to learn from their mistakes. If you feel we should take a harder stance on rule offenses, I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments.

#Admin Bias

Admins have always had the right to play on the server as any other player. The reason for this is pretty simple, the players who are the best fit for admin positions tend to be those who are very active on the server and have a clear understanding of the server rules. Those players are almost always faction leaders or in some kind of faction leadership role. Almost all of our current server admins have at one time ran a faction in some capacity. If we demanded newly recruited admins to abandon their faction, we’d be far more understaffed than we are now. Fortunately/unfortunately (depending on how you look at it), admin duties end up taking almost all of a player's time on the server which leads to admins leaving their factions shortly after their recruitment (currently only one admin on our staff is actively part of a faction). Perhaps we should make it a policy that admins are not allowed to be involved in faction play across the board? 

Admins are not allowed to make any rulings that involve a faction that they are a part of to prevent the obvious conflict of interest. That doesn’t mean we cut off any friendships we’ve made on the server. That’s an unreasonable expectation of us. We do our best to enforce the rules equally, even on those who we may consider our friends. If you have an issue with a ruling, we’ll happily offer clarification on how we came to the conclusion and re-evaluate it if needed. 

#Player Attitudes

I’ll quote a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustfactions/comments/3pcew9/i_am_quitting_and_here_is_why/) to start this out: “An admin lead faction A and B and have good ties with faction C and hate faction D”

This was referring to the admin bias section I mentioned previously but it shows an attitude in the server that we’re really not happy with. We don’t expect people to hold hands and sing “Kumbaya”, but the idea of outright hatred toward a group of players isn’t something that we’re proud to see on the server. Conflicts happen, and perhaps the nature of Rust allows people’s inner asshole to run wild but this shouldn’t be considered normal for Rust Factions. 

Rust Factions is a PvP server at heart, however what separates it from a normal Rust server is that the PvP is supposed to be structured and respectful. Recently, we’ve seen many large alliances coming together against much smaller factions. Many have felt that it has gone beyond the point of being structured and respectful to all involved. Grudges and hate between players is a two-way streak. You can’t expect to be given respect if you don’t give it to others. If you’re a large faction, it’s probably going to get boring if you ally with other factions that could give you a fair fight to team up on lesser factions. Again, this is not to say that PvP and war should be looked down upon, but if your goal in war is only to shit on another group for the sake of shitting on them and running them off the server, well there are hundreds of servers where that’s expected/encouraged behavior. This isn’t one of them. 

#Server Rules

The rules are long and complicated. Every attempt we’ve made to simplify them has been met with players going out of their way to find every way they can abuse them as a method of gaining an advantage over others. I’m not really sure what the solution to this is. We have a “spirit of the server” clause in the rules, but it’s been rarely (if ever) used because of inconsistencies in how it could be interpreted. We’ll probably continue as we are now, iterating every era to patch up loopholes, doing our best to simplify it in areas where it’s possible without being abused. This means the rules will continue to grow larger and more intricate, but I don't see any other solution to this.


#Subreddit Policies

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustfactions/comments/3pcew9/i_am_quitting_and_here_is_why/) post was made earlier today by /u/jambooro. After being up for 6 hours, it was removed because the thread had devolved from constructive feedback to shit-slinging, as we described in the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustfactions/comments/3pe75t/thread_deletion/) immediately following the removal. We have had a long standing policy for the removal of threads announcing quiting from the server. This applied to all cases, whether it was due to someone quitting due to disagreements on the server or someone just taking a break because real life got in the way of Rust. I think it’s evident that this is a bad policy, as it only brings more harm than good. That policy is, however, unrelated to the reason that /u/jambooro’s thread was removed. If you’d like to spread the word about how evil our oppressive regime is, you may do so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/playrustservers/comments/3pel29/rust_faction/). 

We’ve all had a long few days, I hope this post can clear some things up. Before writing this, I did my best to contact as many factions as I could to cover as many grievances as possible. If you have any others you’d like us to address, please leave a comment below.

The current rules on how faction disbandment during war is handled are iffy. A precedent had been set previously [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustfactions/comments/3nhl2f/question_regarding_the_war_between_zoo_and_bucket/cvo50s2) about it, although it was never formally added to the rules. However, land transfer cannot be made during war. Despite KINGs disbandment, that region is going to be considered still at war/contested due to the CotW control over the KING control structures. RADPD's failure to have a control structure in the region further supports  the TN claim over it. We are going to rule that the region currently is owned by TN. RADPD and/or others may still declare war on TN/CotW to contest it, however the existing war dec from CotW on RADPD is going to be ruled inactive. A new war dec will have to be made. 

I personally accept the blame for how this situation was handled. It should never have been allowed to go this far. I had spoken to KING about how their disbandment will work. I had given the OK to RADPD to claim the land when I added it to the map. 

Regardless of your opinion on this ruling, don't put the blame on any factions involved in this conflict, nor anyone else on the admin team. You should put it on me personally as it was my mistake. 

---

We learn from our mistakes, and I wanted to propose this rule for the future:

* If a faction disbands during the war, then it must make a post on the reddit confirming this and state it ingame.

* The disbanding will not take effect for 24 hours after the post is made on the reddit.

* No further war or attack declarations can be made against that faction.

* All existing attack declarations remain live for the 24 hours after the faction's made their disbanding post on the reddit.

* After 24 hours all remaining faction land (excluding land properly claimed during those 24 hours) becomes unclaimed.

We are moving servers (again)! After the infamous DDoS attacks that plagued the beginning of Era 8.5, we began to search for a more stable long term solution. The previous dedicated server that is located in France is a powerful system, however it didn’t provide us with the access we needed to configure the server against future DDoS attacks. 

The new dedicated server is located in Quebec, Canada. It provides us with better specs and much more access to configure things like DDoS protection on the fly. Historically, Rust Factions has always been based in North America. While we have a large European playerbase, [the majority of players are still from North America](http://imgur.com/a/ldXg8). This move to Eastern Canada should provide a middle-ground for both North Americans and Europeans.  


#Donation Info


This is where we need your help. This move will provide greater stability and an overall better gameplay experience, however it comes at a cost. Rust Factions is run entirely by community donations and we need your help to be able to continue on this server.

The server will cost us $80 USD/month. For the sake of transaprency in regards to funding, we have created a [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/rustfactions) page where you can donate monthly. If you’d prefer to make a one-time donation via Paypal, you can still do so [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=7J9PQ9HMRDZRW). Donations provides no in-game bonuses, ranks, or special treatment. Donations are used entirely for server expenses. 

On the Patreon, you might notice a stretch goal of $100 that covers Teamspeak. Currently our Teamspeak server is hosted by GameServers. It is susceptible to DDoS attacks and downtime due to GS’ shoddy reliability and support. Because we take donations, we are not elligable for TeamSpeak’s Non-Profit program. A 128 slot TeamSpeak license (this is just a license to run a TeamSpeak server ourselves, not an actual server) costs $100/year. If we can reach that level of funding, we can purchase a TeamSpeak license ourselves and have the reliability and protection that comes with hosting TeamSpeak on our own hardware.

#RUST FACTIONS CHARTER

This Charter sets out what we expect from players who come to our server. It’s here to help you enjoy your time in game. Our admins interpret the rules in this Charter with common sense. And we expect you to engage with the Charter and our server in the same way.

#RULES AND SPIRIT OF THE SERVER

Rust Factions aims to provide a unique player experience - this isn't your typical rust server.
We expect players to maintain a certain level of roleplay (RP) on the server. So your gameplay must stick to the established community - don’t shoot anything that moves as though you were on a standard battlefield server. Keep to RP and you'll do fine!

The admins can tell when you are trying to “work” around the ruleset or rules that are not totally clear. Warnings and/or bans can be issued if you are found doing this.  

These are the rules that we expect everyone to follow:

##A - General Rules

* Sexism, racism, homophobia, intolerance, harassment, abuse and general toxicity are strictly prohibited in-game, on the subreddit and on our teamspeak.
* Use the “report” link next to a subreddit post that you think requires admin intervention.
* Be respectful to other players at all times. 
* Music and sound effects over voice are allowed but should be used sparingly. If a player asks you to stop, stop.
* Players repeatedly/excessively complaining in chat about KOS/players/rules will be warned, kicked and then - for repeat offenders - banned.
* Keep game chat open for questions, RP, and casual chit-chat.

Remember: it’s just a game and the whole idea is to have fun - so take a break if you need to!

##B - Hacking &amp; exploiting

* Hacking and duping will not be tolerated. Anyone caught will be banned permanently.
* If you think someone’s hacking or duping, message an admin in-game or on the subreddit - don’t talk about it in open chat. It warns the player and admins can’t then spot the issue.
* If you repeatedly publicly accuse players of hacking or duping, you will be banned.
* If you think someone’s exploiting and getting an unfair advantage, private message the admins in-game or send a modmail on the subreddit. Don’t talk about it in open chat.

##C - Griefing

* Placing unwanted items (bear traps, landmines, barricades, walls, etc.) on or around another player’s structure is considered griefing, unless in the context of true RP or war.
* Blocking access to any structure (through the use of walls, halfblocks, etc) at any time is strictly prohibited.






##D - KOS (Killing on Sight)

* You mustn’t KOS except in the context of RP or in a ‘KOS Zone’.
* KOS Zones (eg. ‘The Badlands’) are clearly marked by a skull on the map.
* When in a KOS zone you mustn’t shoot at anyone outside the zone. Likewise, you mustn’t  shoot into a KOS zone from outside it.
* Report any illegal KOS incidents by messaging the admins in game or on the subreddit - don’t complaint about it in open chat.
* Only land-owning factions are allowed to engage in banditry.

As well as in true RP context, KOS is allowed in the following situations:

* Between two factions who are at war (at any time after the war declaration has been made).
* By a faction involved in a war against anyone in the contested map region.
In KOS Zones.
* At airdrops.
* At helicopter crash sites. (But only once the helicopter has been downed!)
* Sleepers can be looted/killed at any time.
* In self-defense.

##E - Tool cupboards

* Tool cupboards must always be accessible by a door. 
* The door can be some levels above/below the cabinet but then there must always be stairs (upgraded to at least wood) or ladders down/up.
* Tool cupboards cannot be placed underwater.

##F - Factions

* A faction must fill out the [Faction Application Form](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustfactions/comments/3rp67d/faction_megathread_era_x/) and post this on the subreddit before claiming land. 
* A faction must have at least 5 active players at all times.
If at least 3 different people from a faction do not log into the server over a 72 hour period, the admins can (at their discretion) declare the faction inactive. 
* Any map regions the faction owns (but not their bases) will then become unclaimed.
* Factions must announce their factions on the subreddit at the beginning of each Era.
* All factions must use the ‘Clans’ plugin to set up their faction in-game. Type “/clan help” in-game for more information about how to create your faction and invite members to it.
* All members of a faction must display the faction clan-tag next to their username at all times.
* Factions can create and enforce laws on map regions they own.
* Factions can’t declare that their map regions are a KOS zone.
* Factions may kill others if they don’t comply with a faction’s laws. But only after a fair and reasonable warning/request to leave has been given and not complied with.
* Factions must declare these laws on the subreddit [Faction Laws Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustfactions/comments/3lhcsh/the_definitive_faction_laws_megathread/)

##G - Independent Players (Indies)

Think of Independent players as the everyday citizens of the island.  Indies must either:

* create a service for others (merchant, bounty hunter, assassin, etc.).

or 

* contribute positively (unique buildings, experiences, being a model citizen).
See the [new players post](&lt;link&gt;) for examples on how to contribute to the player experience.

* To be hired by a faction as a mercenary, an indie must be invited temporarily into the faction that hires them. They must display the faction’s clan-tag in-game.
Indies cannot declare wars or raid any structures (except structures in the badlands or other KOS zones, or when hired as mercenaries by a faction).





##H - Raiding

* Raiding’ means breaking a wall, door or foundation to enter a structure.
* A faction may raid any building on any of their claimed map regions at any time, without warning
* Raiding another faction on their own land is not allowed without a war declaration being made on the subreddit and in-game.
* Outside of war, theft is allowed - but only if you don’t have to break doors, walls, etc to access containers (including quarries/pumpjacks).
* You may place ladders/build stairs, etc to access containers.
* Structures on unclaimed land or in KOS zones (see KOS section above) can be raided at any time.
* Breaking twig structures is not considered raiding.

#Land Claims

##I - Map Regions

* The map’s split into multiple regions at the start of each Era and factions can eventually own any number of connected regions.
* A faction may only claim one region per 12 hour period.
* A faction must construct a ‘control structure’ on each map region it owns.
* A faction can only have one control structure in each region (but they can build as many other structures as they like).
* To be a ‘control structure’, the structure must:
* Be clearly and obviously marked as the faction’s control structure, with clear signs (such as “HQ”, “Citadel” etc) next to external doors.
* Contain at least one tool cupboard (see also the ‘Tool cupboards’ rule, below).
* So it should be clear to anyone that it’s the faction’s control structure for that map region.
* Transferring a region to another faction is allowed, unless either faction in the transfer is at war, and as long as the region being sold will be connected to the faction's existing lands. A faction can transfer to unconnected land if they abandon their old claim.

##J - Capital Regions

* The first region claimed by a faction becomes their Capital Region
* This Capital Region cannot be changed, unless a faction is abandoning its current territories to claim new regions that don't border their current territory.
* The control structure built on a Capital Region is designated the Stronghold and should be the main base of the faction.
* The Stronghold should be clearly marked with a “Stronghold” sign.












##K - Land Claiming - at the start of an Era

* At the start of an Era all map regions will be unclaimed.
* To take ownership of an unclaimed region, a faction must build a ‘control structure’ (these are explained above, under “Map Regions”).  And the faction must then post a ‘Sovereignty Claim’ for that region on the subreddit and announce it in-game.
* A faction may only claim one region per 12 hour period.
* If two factions have control structures in the same region, the region’s ownership becomes contested. This contest can be resolved diplomatically or by war.
* To claim a map region by war, follow the war rules below.
* During the first 24 hours of an Era, you can declare war on someone without having to wait 12 hours before attacking.
* A faction must post a screenshot clearly showing the marked control structure for the sovereignty claim to be valid. 

##L - Land Claiming - if the region is already claimed

* To claim a region owned by someone else, a faction must build a control structure on it.
* Submit a war declaration on the subreddit and announce the war in-game.
* After the relevant time ends (see below), the attacking faction can take control of the region by capturing the defender’s control structure.

##M - City-States

* A city built on a region belonging to a faction can declare independence and function as a “city-state” if a clear border (either a wall or - preferably - clearly marked signs) is built around the city limits.
* A city-state must create a city-state faction and always have at least 5 active members.
* If a city-state faction goes inactive, the city’s ownership passes back to the region owner.
* City-states cannot declare war, but city-state factions can support any faction’s wars.
* Any faction may declare war on a city-state.
* A war declaration made against a city-state doesn’t apply to the faction which owns the map region that the city-state’s in.
* Like factions, City-state factions can create and enforce their own laws within the city.
* See Factions rules for more info.













---




##N - WAR

To declare a war a faction must either:

* own a map region - with a ‘control structure’ (see above - under ‘Map Regions’ - for more information about these) 

or

* If it doesn’t own a map region, have first built a control structure on the map region it intends to conquer.

&amp;nbsp;

* The faction must then declare the war on the subreddit and announce it in-game.
* The war declaration must have a minimum of 150 word RP reasoning behind the war.
When war is declared actual raiding against the defending faction cannot start until:
* 12 hours after the initial declaration.

or 

* If the defending faction’s leadership accepts the declaration before 12 hours ends.
* Before a raid attack can start, it must be posted in the war declaration thread and announced in-game. This is called an 'attack declaration'.
* During a war you may attack one region every 12 hours. This region (and its map grid reference) must be clearly stated in the attack declaration (see above rule).
* During the attack you may only raid/attack bases built on that region.
* Attacking (including raiding) can happen immediately once it’s been announced, even if no enemy faction players are in-game.
* During a war a faction/offensive alliance may only claim one enemy region per 12 hours.
* A faction may only lose one claim per 12 hours (6 hours for a faction containing more than 6 land claims).
* If a faction/offensive alliance declares war against a map region that doesn’t touch its existing borders, then the war is considered either an eviction or a resettlement and:
* The attacker may capture the bases, but can’t claim the region for itself.
* Any region captured must then either be:
* Given to another faction (for payment or any other reason).
* Resettled on by the attacker, who must abandon any unconnected regions they own.
* Left as unclaimed land.

##O - Capturing a Region

To capture a region belonging to an enemy faction:

* You must gain access to the control structure.

And

* Capture it in accordance to the “capturing a control structure” rules listed below.

##P - Capturing a Capital Region

* A Capital Region may only be captured or attacked once all other regions have first been captured (or the owning faction evicted) by the enemy.
* You may never offline raid a Capital Region.
* There must be at least two members of the defending faction online before you can make an attack declaration on a Capital Region.
* There's no need to wait before attacking once a legal attack declaration has been made on a Capital Region.





##Q - Capturing a Control Structure (or Base)

* For a faction to capture an enemy base, the following conditions must be met:
* Replacement of up to 4 external entry doors and code-locks.
* Replacement of any destroyed ground level exterior walls (but not perimeter walls).
* Secure building privilege for the entire contained structure

##R - War Actions

* As soon as a war is declared (including during the initial 12 hours before any attacks can begin), any factions involved are allowed to:
* KOS anyone within the lands owned by the warring factions.
* Construct Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) on enemy territories to enable quick access to the fight. FOBs can be raided by the faction owning the region it’s built on at any time and without warning. 
* FOBs can be built at any time on any map region - but they can also be raided without a war declaration by the map region's owner).
* Once a region attack has been declared on the subreddit, factions involved are allowed to:
* Attack and raid any bases in the specified region.
* Take ownership of the control structure.

##S - Mercenary Factions - assisting in wars

* A mercenary faction may be hired by a warring faction to assist with attack or defence.
* A mercenary faction can’t attack/raid outside its hirer’s map regions without the mercenary faction first making its own war declaration and subsequent region attack declaration.
* A mercenary faction can attack/raid inside its hirer’s map regions without a war or attack declaration.

##T - Ending a War

A war is ended in the following situations:

* One side surrenders.
* Peace negotiations are completed.
* One side captured all the Control Structures in each region and then also the Capitol Region of the other side.

#Alliances

There can be many different types of alliance (trade alliances, resource gathering alliances etc). But with alliances for attack and/or defence there are only two types allowed:

##U - Full Alliances

* A full alliance is an alliance to attack other factions outside of the allies’ territory and to defend each ally's regions.
* A full alliance between two or more factions must be announced on the subreddit and in-game. The announcement must state which players are authorised to speak on the alliance's behalf ('alliance representative')
* Full alliances go to war together by an alliance representative making a single, joint war declaration post on the subreddit and announcing in-game.
* For war attack purposes a full alliance counts as a single faction and may only attack/claim one map region every 12 hours.
* Full alliances may only be declared by faction leadership.

##V - Defensive Alliances

* A purely defensive alliance between two or more factions doesn’t have to be announced.
* Factions in a defensive alliance can only help defend each other’s existing map regions.
* Defensive allies cannot attack enemies outside of each other's existing map regions

* If you think someone’s hacking or duping, message an admin in-game or on the subreddit - don’t talk about it in open chat. It warns the player and admins can’t then spot the issue.
* If you repeatedly publicly accuse players of hacking or duping, you will be banned.
* If you think someone’s exploiting and getting an unfair advantage, private message the admins in-game or send a modmail on the subreddit. Don’t talk about it in open chat.

##Griefing

* Placing unwanted items (bear traps, landmines, barricades, walls, etc.) on or around another player’s structure is considered griefing, unless in the context of true RP or war.
* Blocking access to any structure (through the use of walls, halfblocks, etc) at any time is strictly prohibited.






##KOS (Killing on Sight)

* You mustn’t KOS except in the context of RP or in a ‘KOS Zone’.
* KOS Zones (eg. ‘The Badlands’) are clearly marked by a skull on the map.
* When in a KOS zone you mustn’t shoot at anyone outside the zone. Likewise, you mustn’t  shoot into a KOS zone from outside it.
* Report any illegal KOS incidents by messaging the admins in game or on the subreddit - don’t complaint about it in open chat.

As well as in true RP context, KOS is allowed in the following situations:

* Between two factions who are at war (at any time after the war declaration has been made).
* By a faction involved in a war against anyone in the contested map region.
In KOS Zones.
* At airdrops.
* At helicopter crash sites. (But only once the helicopter has been downed!)
* Sleepers can be looted/killed at any time.

##Tool cupboards

* Tool cupboards must always be accessible by a door. 
* The door can be some levels above/below the cabinet but then there must always be stairs (upgraded to at least wood) or ladders down/up.

##Factions

* A faction must have at least 5 active players at all times.
If at least 3 different people from a faction do not log into the server over a 72 hour period, the admins can (at their discretion) declare the faction inactive. 
* Any map regions the faction owns (but not their bases) will then become unclaimed.
* Factions must announce their factions on the subreddit at the beginning of each Era.
* All factions must use the ‘Clans’ plugin to set up their faction in-game. Type “/clan help” in-game for more information about how to create your faction and invite members to it.
* All members of a faction must display the faction clan-tag next to their username at all times.
* Factions can create and enforce laws on map regions they own.
* Factions can’t declare that their map regions are a KOS zone.
* Factions may kill others if they don’t comply with a faction’s laws. But only after a fair and reasonable warning/request to leave has been given and not complied with.
* Factions must declare these laws on the subreddit [Faction Laws Megathread](&lt;link&gt;)

##Independent Players (Indies)

Think of Independent players as the everyday citizens of the island.  Indies must either:

* create a service for others (merchant, bounty hunter, assassin, etc.).

or 

* contribute positively (unique buildings, experiences, being a model citizen).
See the [new players post](&lt;link&gt;) for examples on how to contribute to the player experience.

* To be hired by a faction as a mercenary, an indie must be invited temporarily into the faction that hires them. They must display the faction’s clan-tag in-game.
Indies cannot declare wars or raid any structures (except structures in the badlands or other KOS zones, or when hired as mercenaries by a faction).





##Raiding

* Raiding’ means breaking a wall, door or foundation to enter a structure.
* A faction may raid any building on any of their claimed map regions at any time, without warning
* Raiding another faction on their own land is not allowed without a war declaration being made on the subreddit and in-game.
* Outside of war, theft is allowed - but only if you don’t have to break doors, walls, etc to access containers (including quarries/pumpjacks).
* You may place ladders/build stairs, etc to access containers.
* Structures on unclaimed land or in KOS zones (see KOS section above) can be raided at any time.

##Land Claims

##Map Regions

* The map’s split into multiple regions at the start of each Era and factions can eventually own any number of connected regions.
* A faction may only claim one region per 12 hour period.
* A faction must construct a ‘control structure’ on each map region it owns.
* A faction can only have one control structure in each region (but they can build as many other structures as they like).
* To be a ‘control structure’, the structure must:
* Be clearly and obviously marked as the faction’s control structure, with clear signs (such as “HQ”, “Citadel” etc) next to external doors.
* Contain at least one tool cupboard (see also the ‘Tool cupboards’ rule, below).
* So it should be clear to anyone that it’s the faction’s control structure for that map region.
* Selling a region to another faction is allowed, unless either faction in the sale is at war, and as long as the region being sold will be connected to the purchasing faction's existing lands. A faction can purchase unconnected land if they abandon their old claim.

##Capital Regions

* The first region claimed by a faction becomes their Capital Region
* This Capital Region cannot be changed, unless a faction is abandoning its current territories to claim new regions that don't border their current territory.
* The control structure built on a Capital Region is designated the Stronghold and should be the main base of the faction.
* The Stronghold should be clearly marked with a “Stronghold” sign.












##Land Claiming - at the start of an Era

* At the start of an Era all map regions will be unclaimed.
* To take ownership of an unclaimed region, a faction must build a ‘control structure’ (these are explained above, under “Map Regions”).  And the faction must then post a ‘Sovereignty Claim’ for that region on the subreddit and announce it in-game.
* A faction may only claim one region per 12 hour period.
* If two factions have control structures in the same region, the region’s ownership becomes contested. This contest can be resolved diplomatically or by war.
* To claim a map region by war, follow the war rules below.
* During the first 24 hours of an Era, you can declare war on someone without having to wait 12 hours before attacking.

##Land Claiming - if the region is already claimed

* To claim a region owned by someone else, a faction must build a control structure on it.
* Submit a war declaration on the subreddit and announce the war in-game.
* After the relevant time ends (see below), the attacking faction can take control of the region by capturing the defender’s control structure.

##City-States

* A city built on a region belonging to a faction can declare independence and function as a “city-state” if a clear border (either a wall or - preferably - clearly marked signs) is built around the city limits.
* A city-state must create a city-state faction and always have at least 5 active members.
* If a city-state faction goes inactive, the city’s ownership passes back to the region owner.
* City-states cannot declare war, but city-state factions can support any faction’s wars.
* Any faction may declare war on a city-state.
* A war declaration made against a city-state doesn’t apply to the faction which owns the map region that the city-state’s in.
* Like factions, City-state factions can create and enforce their own laws within the city.
* See Factions rules for more info.

#WAR

To declare a war a faction must either:

* own a map region - with a ‘control structure’ (see above - under ‘Map Regions’ - for more information about these) 

or

* If it doesn’t own a map region, have first built a control structure on the map region it intends to conquer.

&amp;nbsp;

* The faction must then declare the war on the subreddit and announce it in-game.
When war is declared actual raiding against the defending faction cannot start until:
* 12 hours after the initial declaration.
or 
* If the defending faction’s leadership accepts the declaration before 12 hours ends.
* Before a raid attack can start, it must be posted in the war declaration thread and announced in-game. This is called an 'attack declaration'.
* During a war you may attack one region every 12 hours. This region (and its map grid reference) must be clearly stated in the attack declaration (see above rule).
* During the attack you may only raid/attack bases built on that region.
* Attacking (including raiding) can happen immediately once it’s been announced, even if no enemy faction players are in-game.
* During a war a faction/offensive alliance may only claim one enemy region per 12 hours.
* A faction may only lose one claim per 12 hours.
* If a faction/offensive alliance declares war against a map region that doesn’t touch its existing borders, then the war is considered either an eviction or a resettlement and:
* The attacker may capture the bases, but can’t claim the region for itself.
* Any region captured must then either be:
* Given to another faction (for payment or any other reason).
* Resettled on by the attacker, who must abandon any unconnected regions they own.
* Left as unclaimed land.

##Capturing a Region

To capture a region belonging to an enemy faction:

* You must gain access to the control structure.

And

* Capture it in accordance to the “capturing a control structure” rules listed below.

##Capturing a Capital Region

* A Capital Region may only be captured or attacked once all other regions have first been captured (or the owning faction evicted) by the enemy.
* You may never offline raid a Capital Region.
* There must be at least two members of the defending faction online before you can make an attack declaration on a Capital Region.
* There's no need to wait before attacking once a legal attack declaration has been made on a Capital Region.





##Capturing a Control Structure (or Base)

* For a faction to capture an enemy base, the following conditions must be met:
* Replacement of up to 4 external entry doors and code-locks.
* Replacement of any destroyed ground level exterior walls (but not perimeter walls).
* Secure building privilege for the entire contained structure

##War Actions

* As soon as a war is declared (including during the initial 12 hours before any attacks can begin), any factions involved are allowed to:
* KOS anyone within the lands owned by the warring factions.
* Construct Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) on enemy territories to enable quick access to the fight. FOBs can be raided by the faction owning the region it’s built on at any time and without warning. 
* FOBs can be built at any time on any map region - but they can also be raided without a war declaration by the map region's owner).
* Once a region attack has been declared on the subreddit, factions involved are allowed to:
* Attack and raid any bases in the specified region.
* Take ownership of the control structure.

##Mercenary Factions - assisting in wars

* A mercenary faction may be hired by a warring faction to assist with attack or defence.
* A mercenary faction can’t attack/raid outside its hirer’s map regions without the mercenary faction first making its own war declaration and subsequent region attack declaration.
* A mercenary faction can attack/raid inside its hirer’s map regions without a war or attack declaration.

##Ending a War

A war is ended in the following situations:

* One side surrenders.
* Peace negotiations are completed.
* One side captured all the Control Structures in each region and then also the Capitol Region of the other side.

#Alliances

There can be many different types of alliance (trade alliances, resource gathering alliances etc). But with alliances for attack and/or defence there are only two types allowed:

##Full Alliances

* A full alliance is an alliance to attack other factions outside of the allies’ territory and to defend each ally's regions.
* A full alliance between two or more factions must be announced on the subreddit and in-game. The announcement must state which players are authorised to speak on the alliance's behalf ('alliance representative')
* Full alliances go to war together by an alliance representative making a single, joint war declaration post on the subreddit and announcing in-game.
* For war attack purposes a full alliance counts as a single faction and may only attack/claim one map region every 12 hours.
* Full alliances may only be declared by faction leadership.

##Defensive Alliances

* A purely defensive alliance between two or more factions doesn’t have to be announced.
* Factions in a defensive alliance can only help defend each other’s existing map regions.
* Defensive allies cannot attack enemies outside of each other's existing map regions

The update will likely hit mid-afternoon US time. How long it takes for us to go online after the update depends on one major factor: Whether procgen updates or not.

The most time consuming aspect of a getting the server online after a wipe for us is picking and drawing a new map. So far, a mandatory wipe is confirmed. However, whether procgen will receive an update this week with the new dungeon changes is still up in the air. 

If procgen is not updated, we can have a map finished and be live as soon as Oxide is updated. If procgen is updated, we will be down until a new map can be found and finished.

We wanted to thank everyone who voiced their opinions about the rules, from the start we've wanted to build them with the community and some of you have gone above and beyond in the effort you've put into helping us fine tune them. 

The most major significant made is the introduction of the ""stronghold"" suggestion. Under this system, a factions initial claim will be considered their capital region. The capital region houses the stronghold. The capital region can only be raided if all other regions have been captured and can only be raided if at least 2 defenders are online.

We've drafted up a new ruleset, that hopes to simplify rules and make things as clear as possible. 

No doubt there will be problems with the new rules, that's why we're opening up this discussion. We need the community's input on this. 

**The most significant change is the re-introduction of offline raiding.** The reasoning behind this is the many loopholes that exist with the online raiding requirement. Not only can it be abused to raid dodge, it can be abused to hold certain players hostage in regards to timezone differences (e.g. Faction X wants to attack Faction Y. Faction X is 7 hours behind Faction Y. It's convenient for Faction X to raid in the evenings, but faction Y ends up having to play deep into the night to defend).

With this change, we have limited the amount of regions a faction is allowed to capture to one per 12 hour period. This is to prevent a faction sweeping through in the middle of a night and wiping out a faction.

If you have any questions about our reasoning for certain rules, please post them below. If you have any suggestions, find any problems, disagree, please post them below. We want the rules to be crafted with the community's participation and approval.

Welcome to the second Rustifac Town Hall. The last Town Hall went very well, and we implemented many of the community's suggestions into the server.

So the new half era started, and we think it's going amazingly well. We're seeing some awesome RP and some amazing [builds](http://i.imgur.com/dIV1ETJ.png). The new Badlands are providing some interesting new dynamics and we really enjoy them as a feature.

#On plugins:

So today we wanted to discuss HuntRPG and SignArtist again, and we have created a survey to better gauge the community's views on them.

**HuntRPG:**

HuntRPG is a leveling system we're considering as a replacement system for 2x gather. By default, it has a wide variety of features that would not be a good fit for the server, so it would be severely gutted. Here is our preliminary configuration for it if it was to be introduced:

* The stats system that provides bonuses to health/speed/crafting will be completely removed. 

* The only skills available would be Lumberjack (Wood), Miner (Stone), Hunter (Animals), and Blacksmith (Furnace speed). 

* The gather rates would be capped at 2.5x, it would serve as a replacement for the current 2x gather we have on Wood/Stone. 

**SignArtist:**

SignArtist is a plugin that allows users to upload an image to a sign, rather than having to draw it. It has been by far the most requested feature on the server. However, there have been a few reasons we've been reluctant to add it.

* It would kill some RP. We've had some amazing sign artists on the server who would hire out their services to create some awesome artwork. This would essentially make their work pointless.

* It's open to abuse. We know some people's obsession with drawing dicks *cough* Bungles *cough*. We worry that the SignArtist plugin would be used to upload pornographic and offensive images. 

If we introduce SignArtist, here's what we're thinking. If someone is found to be abusing it to upload pornographic or offensive images, they will be banned. If the abuse becomes too frequent, then the plugin will be removed. 

----

Now the most important part out of all of this is a survey we're running. It's only 11 quick questions and it'll be used to help us make decisions on the server. It's completely anonymous, so we ask that you feel free to speak your mind.

**Some changes to server rules and policies have been made:**

* The minimum amount of players to a faction has been raised from 3 to 5.


* Non-continuous land claims are no longer allowed in any context. You may not have satellite or outpost claims. If declaring a conquest war on a faction that does not touch your borders, it is not considered an eviction or resettlement war. Upon a victory condition, the lands must either be given up and abandoned (unclaimed), ceded to another faction (possibly for payment), or the victors must abandon their old claim(s) and resettle on the conquered land. 

* If a faction is at war, they are not allowed to sell their land to another faction. 

* A faction no longer needs to completely enclose/mark their borders in-game to enforce laws on their land. However, factions are no longer allowed to make their lands a KOS zone (except in the context of war). A faction may have a no trespassing law, but the trespasser must be warned before they are allowed to be killed.

* Factions must post their laws in the [Faction Laws Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustfactions/comments/3lhcsh/the_definitive_faction_laws_megathread/)

* Helicopter drops are KOS, in the same way that airdrops are. 

* During the first 24 hours of an era, a faction can claim a maximum of 4 regions. 

----

The biggest change that you'll be seeing is the **Badlands**. The badlands are a 3 grid wide zone that cross the middle of the map. In the Badlands, there are no restrictions on KOS or raiding. Expect this land to be traveled by bandits, and if you plan on trading resources between the North and the South then prepare to hire security. 

Upon entering a KOS zone, you'll receive a message on your screen that you are inside it. This should clear up confusion on where KOS zones start/end. This also applies to the Badlands. 

----

With the start of a new era, there will be a rush to claims lands. In the past, we had required factions to post screenshot proof that they had a structure and a cabinet on their lands. This era that policy will not be in effect. Admins will be policing land claims and if factions are found to be claiming lands without having a structure on them then they will be penalized.

**The 12 hour rule on conquest wars has been suspended for the first 24 hours of the era.** 


----

Factions will be disbanded at the start of the new era.

##WAR

When war is declared on a faction actual raiding cannot start until 12 hours after the initial declaration or the opposing faction leadership accepts the declaration of war to start sooner. 

War Declarations are either for Profit or for Conquest. The Declaration type cannot be changed without a new declaration and a 24 hour waiting period (or opposition acceptance)

###Profit: 

Profit wars are for loot only.

Raiders cannot:

* capture the base
* replace doors/locks
* grief the structure - ladders twig stairs/floors for navigation are allowed. 

These raids can be performed while offline but must be announced they occurred after they are over. These announcements can be appended to the war declaration post.

Foundation and overall destruction should be kept to a minimum. Some, even a lot of destruction is to be expected when raiding a faction but restraint should be exercised where possible. 

###Conquest: 

Conquest raids require 2 defenders to be online and announced in game and on the reddit with time/timezone with a  minimum of 30 minutes notice and a maximum 1 hour time window. If no players are online during the attack time than the attack can occur anytime that the target has the required number of defenders online to prevent dodging raids.

Update your war declaration with attack announcements and after the attack update with the outcome if any effects to the claims map came from it.  

If a faction goes inactive for 48 hours the online restriction can be waived. 

If declaring a conquest war on a faction that does not touch your borders, that war is considered either an eviction war or a resettlement war. You may capture the bases, but you may not claim the land for yourself. You must either cede the land to another faction (whether it be for payment or any othe reason), leave it as unclaimed land, or abandon your previous claim and resettle. 

###Base Conquest 

Requirements for base capture are:

* replacement of all external ground level doors (limit of 4 )and code-locks 
* closing any open window frames with a frame
* replacement and repair of ground level outside walls (“plugging the holes”)
* You must authorize and secure building rights for the entire contained structure to declare it captured. (For multiple structures each structure in the town can be captured independently so long as the doors and complete cabinet coverage is claimed.)
* Perimeter walls do not  count as external doors. 
* External Door Frames cannot be replaced with walls unless they exceed 4 outer doors.



## Land Claiming/Land conquest

The map is split up into claimable regions as determined by the admins at world gen.

Factions can claim any continuous tract of land (the claims must be connected to one another) but to hold it the faction must have at least one tool cabinet bearing structure within each claimed area.  This cabinet structure can be a 1x1, a watch tower or a base structure/complex and the cabinet must be accessible by doors.

Claim structures should be reasonable, use common sense and your best judgement. The admins won't look favorably on sticking 30 1x1’s in a region and considering them your control structures. It goes against the spirit of the server. Having a 1x1 cabinet structure is reasonable - but if you have the resources to build several you should have a “real” structure like a watchtower  or bunker instead.

A control structure is also required along with the clearly defined borders for law enforcement in that region. a region cannot have laws enforced on it if it does not posses a control structure. 

If there is NOT a Cabinet structure in the claimed region during a conquest war then the warring faction can place a Cabinet structure to secure that tile. 

If there IS a cabinet structure on the claimed region than you may construct your own control structure to put the tile into a contested state. How the contention of the tile is resolved is up to the involved factions. (war, diplomacy, trade etc.)    

Successfully capturing the enemy control structure in a region during a conquest war will allow you to claim control of that region. 

If you need to edit your recent land claim please post a new sovereignty claim post and remove/delete your old one - this prevents confusion for the mapmakers and others trying to keep up with claims. 

Selling land to other factions is allowed, however not while a faction is under a war declaration.

We have always planned to wipe at the start of each month with the mandatory wipe. Unfortunately, we have been on the cusp of our collider limit for almost the last week, doing everything we could to keep it from reaching the limit. Yesterday, we had to use our last resort of halving resource rates (trees/animals/nodes/etc). We had been hoping to just keep things running until the collider limit was fixed. The collider limit fix was planned for todays patch, however the Rust devs weren't able to finish it and it has been delayed 2 weeks. See [Devblog](http://playrust.com/devblog-78/).
 
We have no choice but to wipe the server. BPs will stay, they are still planned to be wiped with the next mandatory wipe (2 weeks).
 
None of us wanted this to happen, especially with many new players and factions starting out recently.
 
For the next 24 hours, there will be a ""Hell Day"". Rules on KOS/Raiding have been suspended. Rules on player behavior (bigoted language etc) are still in effect. Take this time to research what you can, blow all your resources and have some fun.

24 hours from now, Era 8.5NR will begin. It will be a 2 week era, same length as this last one. There will be a new map, and possibly some rule changes. Those will be posted before the new era begins. We need these 24 hours to set up the new map and get thing ready for next era.

We're trying to be as transparent as possible as we all want to have a thriving Rust Factions community. 

----

Quite a few changes have been made in the last week. Most have been on the backend and are primarily for admin use and rule enforcement, however there have been a few that have had a large effect on the player base. Currently, decay rates for external walls are at vanilla levels, however crafting time is increased from vanilla and the walls are not stackable. Decay affects twig whether it's reset under the new decay system or not. If you're building out of twig, don't expect it to last long. Decay rates for regular buildings are quite a bit higher than vanilla, but the decay timer gets reset when a door connected to them is opened so if you're logging in once or twice a day it shouldn't be an issue. 

We don't like decay, historically we've had decay completely disabled on this server, however we're dangerously close to the collider limit and we're doing everything we can to keep things going until Thursday (when the collider fix is supposed to be released). If we reach the collider limit, you will no longer be able to build. As of this post we are at 252,000 colliders. The limit is 256,000. One fix we have if/when we reach the limit is to lower respawn rates on trees/nodes/animals. It's not something we want to do, but it's our last resort. If you have any abandoned buildings on your land, please let an admin know and they'll come by and remove it. 

----

Discussions have started for next era, and we're thinking about bringing back a northern KOS zone. This would be a pretty major change, so we wanted the communities input on it. In the past, the entire north was a KOS/Anarchy zone. There were no restrictions on raiding/KOSing and land could not be claimed in the north. 

We're considering removing 2x gather for wood/stone and replacing it with [HuntRPG](http://oxidemod.org/plugins/hunt-rpg.841/). If you're not familiar with it, it's a leveling plugin, where the more of a certain action you do the more you level and the higher gather rate you get. We would heavily reconfigure the plugin, removing the ""Stats Points"" system entirely, taming/blinktoarrow would not be implemented, and the gather rate would be capped between 2x and 3x. From a balance perspective, not much should change other than having to level up to get our current gather rates. This might be a pretty polarizing addition, so we wanted everyone's thoughts on it.
