Second, even though some of the questions there are easily answered on google, starting a discussion about it gives you so much more. You can have different peoples views on some of the issues I stead of reading the opinions of tech people who rank high in google search.

198,"1.) Same as the previous review, I feel 30 seconds would be a little rushed. You should maybe try for a happy medium around 45 seconds. Some of the pauses between you talking seemed a little long. 
2) Yes, you do make it perfectly clear what the channel is going to be about
3) Once again, yes. You did a perfect job describing the direction of your channel. I'll be looking forward to your videos
4) Not sure if music would help, but you do need to improve your audio. There's a little bit of background noise when you speak and complete silence in between. Also you may want to give it an extra millisecond or two before you cut audio when you finish speaking. Between that and the background noise the sound came across a little harsh

199,"Very well done video. I'm not a comic book reader, but the video was clear enough not to loose me. Editing is great and audio sounds perfect. The clips are all a good length, long enough to fully grasp it, but not long enough to bore the viewer. The very last comic clip was maybe a touch too long. It seemed to linger a little longer than  nessesary. One thing I would suggest changing is maybe taking out some of the fade to white transitions. I felt like they were a little overdone. As I mentioned before the audio was perfect, but your presentation seemed a little monotone. Using a little more expression in your voice would go a long way. Now these little flaws are exactly what they are, little flaws. Overall it was a great video, and I'm assuming if I read comic books, I would enjoy it even more.
