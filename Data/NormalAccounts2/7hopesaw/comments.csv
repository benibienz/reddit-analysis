24,"no problem! I'm just here to help :)

if you're just gaming, the stock cooler will do just fine. the benefits of taking a AIO liquid cooler are outweighed by the CPU's capability of staying cool under the most circumstances. 

I'd only really run an AIO on a rig that will get overclocked pretty heavily, or on a workstation that will be crunching a lot of numbers for the most of it's uptime. in your case, liquid cooling won't be worth it's price.",2016-02-04 08:51:01+00:00,czncy34,3,t1_czncm4r,1302,buildapc
25,"well what I can say is this. for how long do you plan on keening the temporary CPU? because if it's just temporary, you *could* be better off with a cheaper CPU. I've provided a [CPU comparison chart](http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-6600K-vs-Intel-Core-i3-6100) that I think is worth looking at, considering the fact that you'd be saving about 120 spacebucks this way. you could then use this saved up money to buy a temporary GTX 950, so you can at least have an acceptable framerate while you're patiently waiting for those two GPU monsters ;)

the radiator seems fine too, it doesn't matter which AIO liquid cooler you get really, they all equal out at around the same performance. 120mm radiators will provide a little less cooling while being somewhat quieter (just one fan) while 240 mm radiators will keep your CPU a little cooler, but being a little louder.

I'm trying not to open my mouth about the RAM overclock but I just can't. I know it's none of my business, but OC'ing RAM really won't get you any benefit other than your components not lasting as long as intended.",2016-02-04 08:40:37+00:00,czncsbh,1,t3_44496i,6412,buildapc
26,"well for one thing, having a liquid cooled CPU does keep it cooler under bigger loads, so your pc will be running more quiet for longer. I find overclocking on a CPU such as yours to be kind of useless anyway (this is just my opinion though!) as it is already a really good CPU and you won't be getting any real noticeable benefit out of it. 

may I ask what the PC is going to be used for? if workstation, sticking with the h100i seems like the best option with the least amount of hassle. 

If gaming, I'd say it's your pick. the CPU won't benefit much from being watercooled under gaming load, air cooling should be just fine. 

hope this helped :)",2016-02-04 08:16:52+00:00,czncf2f,1,t3_444deh,542,buildapc
27,"I'd say if you want the most lifetime out of your pc, try an all-in-one cooling solution. This'll keep your CPU cool while not having to deal with the hassle of setting up a custom water loop, which is also messy and potentially dangerous. 

The 980Ti will probably last for ages, even without watercooling, as it will run cool and silently for the bigger portion of it's lifespan. 

Then, if you have a PSU that pulls in air from the bottom, put it the other way around. it often draws in lots of dust. make sure to have a positive airflow in your case. be sure to read up on airflow if you want to have a clean pc.

cleaning wise, around once every two months should suffice. just put your pc outsite and go at it with a can of air, so the dust you just blew out doesn't get into your pc again. the parts you should be looking out for are the fans (never let them spin if you use canned air! always hold them so they don't spin when doing that!) and PSU fan, people skip this one often.if you have a large heatsink, remove it and clean the metal fins (dust likes to hide in small places) 

to keep it clean on the software side, I suggest installing 360 security. I have it installed and it takes care of all my cleaning needs, like looking for needless files (thus making free drive space), patching windows updates in the background, and a really good antimalware engine, while being free too. this is just my two cents though.

If you do this regularly, you can easily achieve 7-8 years with your build. also make sure to defrag that hard drive every year or so, so it doesn't have to work so hard to load up your files (read up on this if you don't know what I mean, interesting stuff)

hope this helped :)
