I've been having an issue which has been reoccuring lately.
The Wi-Fi in my laptop sometimes randomly shuts off, and I'm not able to fix this unless I reboot the system. it doesn't seem to be related to under how much load it is, neither is there any indicator as to what triggers it.

 I've had this problem a year or so ago too, when I first updated my laptop to Windows 8.1. Back then the problem would only occur when I pressed the Wi-Fi toggle button on my keyboard. however, now it has popped up again, but it doesn't happen when I press said button. it always happens at irregular intervals.

interestingly too, my subscription for BitDefender (malware and virus scanner and privacy guard) ran out as I was no longer interested in their service, as I felt there were free solutions with the same competence. from this point on, I started having aforementioned problem.

I have already scanned my pc for any malicious software twice using 360 Total Security, to no avail, as my wireless just gave up again in the middle of writing this post. 

so thank you in advance, for at least taking a look at my problem.

edit: I also use OpenDNS, I have no idea if that even has a single shit to do with it, but better safe than sorry I guess.
