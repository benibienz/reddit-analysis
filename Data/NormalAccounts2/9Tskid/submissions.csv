Mate, you were my best friend, you're still here, as here as a rock is present.

You aren't who you were, I can't ever see who you were again. 

I last seen you at the police station, I stopped but boy was I hesitant. 

I'm sure looking back I could have helped more, however after you everything you still blamed her. 

You this is my attempt at writing a poem.

Terrible just like it's my attempt to validate my never knowing. 

Knowing what to do, who to seek. 

Being ever afraid that I'll want to have a peek. 

A peek at how it feels, a taste of all the thrills.

Your new best friend giving you feelings, that all of us couldn't compare. 

When you went to rehab and wanted change, it was a breath of fresh air.

Though you couldn't continue without the thought of your best friend. 

I'm just afraid I would be there to see it end. 

I left and you never seen me again, if I was a stronger man, I wouldn't have been scared. 

I can justify it a million ways, the end truth is, I wasn't all quite there. 

I know your end is coming.
I won't appear at your funeral.

For the end isn't the physical death.

I don't want to stop trying, trying this poem or trying to stop my thoughts.

Full of the good times, we laughed, we cried, we dropped, we struggled.

I stopped, you didn't, I hated that life, you did too. I left it, don't know how, you tried too but couldn't avail. 

You're still my best friend, the memories are ever present, I'm sorry I am not there, hope you don't resent. 

What the fuck am I writing, just empty thoughts! I didn't know I was there to talk. 

I hate what you've done and how I little I did. We were going to conquer the world, where are you? 

I can't be angry! I want too but it's not my story, I miss you and I don't want my next time to see you, will be at the viewing.

I have a son you know? You'd love him. 

Hope he will meet you, the former you. 

The real you, I hope to see again. Until than dear friend, don't go too far. Please kick that needle and our friendships, unlike your arm, shall bear no scars. ",opiates,All but a memory,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5as0b4/all_but_a_memory/

I don't know who to ask for help or guidance as I've never known anyone in a good enough relationship to give me guidance. 

My SO is emotionally immature and she loses it all the time. We have a 2 and half year old and I don't want this to lead into a shitty relationship like my parents. They resent each other, still feel the tension when they're in the room but are together.

She sometimes hits me and I have pushed her back and grabbed her before but I will never do it again. She constantly shoves me and pinches me and I take it. My father would beat my mum all the time and I never want to be like that but she won't let me leave. She accuses me of wanting other women and says she'll move overseas or to the other side of the country. 

I  don't want a custody battle but I don't know what to do or where to turn too. 
I'm in Australia if that helps with any laws that may be different. 

She has threatened to tell the cops ""lies"" what lies I'm unsure of. I can't talk to people(friends or family) about her because I don't want them to hate her for how she has treated me.
