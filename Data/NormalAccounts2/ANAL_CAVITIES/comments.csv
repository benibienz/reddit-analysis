Oh shit I actually remembered what I had to say for ZFF this week. So this should take a while and isn't entirely ZFF, but I never really have any other place for stuff like this, and I'm not about to make an entire post of it's own for it...but yeah anyway if you're looking for yet another ""Sasha isn't that good"" post, this isn't the place for it.

My first and main point is about AMAs, and the quality of AMAs. In the past, I've seen people question the authenticity of /u/inmynothing doing them over the phone; that is not that they're completely fake or anything (although one or two people have made that claim as well), but that it just isn't the same as the person answering for themselves. Now I understand the argument, but boy there's been some good examples recently of how much better the ones /u/inmynothing handle end up being. 

Before I elaborate, this leads me into a second thing I wanted to say. When less known people (going to use WhatCulture as the obvious example) do AMAs, there's often a lot of responses like ""who gives a shit"", ""how much did these fucks pay the /r/SC mods for this shit to get stickied"" and so on. Now I know the mod bribe thing is just a meme for like 99% of the people that say it, I participate in the fucking around about it quite often myself,  but I know that some people out there are just generally baffled by AMAs and shit that don't involve Ric Flair and other giant companies and businesses. See, /r/SquaredCircle was made when the top mod of /r/ProWrestling got increasingly more ridiculous over time towards his hatred for the WWE and his want for only smaller, independent wrestling promotions to be the focus of the sub. That lead to the founding of /r/SquaredCircle, and the focus that we have today, of everyone of all shapes and sizes with their foot in the wrestling business getting their fare share of attention. It lead to the community that you see today, a community that has it's ups and downs, but in the end has became a place that people in the industry know about. Which is where I go back to the AMAs.

Guys like the WhatCulture guys and Jeremy Botter weren't sought out by us, in the way that a few folks used to PM and email wrestlers in the beginning, hoping they'd do an AMA. That hard work lead to IMN having the contacts he has today that pay off so often. Anyway, people like WhatCulture, Botter, or my favorite, when [Tom Lawler](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/50xhxz/im_filthy_tom_lawlor_ill_hang_out_here_for_a_few/) randomly showed up at like 1 AM last month do AMAs, they've just heard about the sub, they are actually redditors and just hit us up with a modmail like ""hey, you think people would be interested in _____?"" And of course we give them a shot, because why not? It doesn't matter if there's a bunch of people who don't like their content, there's plenty more that *do* and it's not hard to ignore a link on the internet if you don't. It's just all part of trying to be a wrestling forum for all types of fans.

So...that took longer than I thought it would. ANYWAY, back to the quality of /u/inmynothing versus user done AMAs. Now don't get me wrong, some do just fine on their own. WhatCulture seems great at interaction on Reddit in particular, and that's coming from someone who's never seen their product and has said plenty of critical things about their website in the past. That being said, in particular, Bull and Botter really make me appreciate how well done IMN's AMAs are done. Bull I kinda feel bad about, because in the end I think he was just a little naive or unaware of how the internet can be, but that doesn't stop the whole thing from being any less awkward. Botter/Flosports is different, but I'd still describe it as awkward. Now lemme point out, I had no interest in reading it at all, but someone reported a bunch of a single users comments in the AMA. This user had responded to a bunch of Botter's answers, in particular, the answers that were just like...""yes!"" or just vague non answers (I suck at describing it so take a look for yourself if you're curious)...or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/59fu5i/im_jeremy_botter_managing_editor_at_flosports_ama/d98qens/). I'm not trying to be a dick or call people out for being shitty at community interaction or anything, but some of the awkwardness just really makes me appreciate how well the phone interviews go. And I dunno maybe I'm being too harsh; obviously not all people are going to have the same type charisma and grasp on the dos and donts of promoting and shit like that, but yeah. Idk. Just wanted to do a bunch of random ranting and raving and felt like there's never anywhere else to put it. In the end I should probably just shut up and keep marking out over all the awesome people we get to come hang out for a bit.

TL;DR /u/inmynothing a best, and feel free to proceed to flame me about how I worse to Bull than anyone else.

They obviously can view anything that was deleted; there's plenty of legal and other reasons why they could end up needing to do that, so nothing is ever completely purged from the site once you submit it, and uneddit just produces that information...somehow.

Uneddit's FAQ doesn't really go into detail on the specifics if you were hoping for a more educated answer. Also I think there's a few other tools that do the same thing so maybe they give a better explanation of the process, but I'm too lazy to look them up. One last thing, they're maaaaybe kinda sketchy in regards to Reddit user agreement shit, but as long as your not screen-capping peoples deleted comments and harassing them/starting a witchhunt about something they said or anything like that I don't think any spooky admin boogeymen are going to do anything about it.

That said, a well time DAYUM (see Grizzlemania 2 for all you young cats) can be equally effective. 

As for in between battles, I might suggest going across the street and finding something to power-saw during the next battle. An alternative is simply participating in any activity that leaves you with an above average body temperature, which will hopefully result in you fainting during a battle, which will make for a funny blooper.

Also to touch on the ""what's there to do at these events"" part, I find battle events to be a very good place to meet women, so if you're single who knows, maybe you'll find the perfect person for you.

186,"Honestly I'm probably a shitty person to talk on the subject because I'm biased from LOVING Kane for years and years, and also am one of these weirdos that actually believes Bray's losing is an alright thing, but I'll give my thoughts on it.

Starting with Kane, I agree with having him doing something is nice, and if that something is randomly attacking people every few shows, I'm all for it. I fucking love insane monster don't give a fuck Kane, and I really think he's at his best when he's just showing up, murdering someone the crowd is annoyed by, and leaving. And they usually pop for it too, unlike when he's in the main title picture against people a lot younger and relevant and shit.

As for Bray, I definitely don't think him losing at Backlash is a problem, especially after an RKO followed by a Chokeslam, but I would like to see him get more wins back overall I guess. I know people get turned off by him doing the same thing over and over again (targeting someone, talking about why he's great and what their flaws are), but to me it works with him. He's a cult leader, a snake oil salesman, it makes sense for him to have been defeated by still possess that insane charisma and belief and ability to convince people that he can defeat what lies ahead of him next.

In the end I guess I gotta go with Bray beating Orton being better, it would make him look like a beast and give him even more credibility to take on anyone on the roster than he already has. But, I don't think it's the end of the world if he doesn't.

Oh and Orton is just Orton no matter what, if he wins or loses he can still RKO practically anyone and it be a convincing death blow, pretty much Cena-esque in that regard.",2016-09-13 11:12:40+00:00,d7ktva9,1.0,t3_52jv0f,948.0,SquaredCircle

Actually, the next night, one or two people in the crowd tried to get that chant for two outstanding matches (one of which was The Young Bucks vs. Fenix &amp; Pentagon Jr., and the other was Ricochet vs. Will Ospreay, which was incredible), and in both cases, almost nobody would join in and the chants went nowhere.

But it was the first time that had happened when I was in the building. And at the same moment, Ricochet and Ospreay looked directly at me. On Twitter and other places, I’ve read people saying that if I held up my hand with five fingers, it would have gotten the biggest pop of the night. So my split second judgment was that I wanted to cover the show, but not be part of the show, which isn’t always the case when you have people blowing kisses at you before they hit a move with your name on it.

I started to make a huge new flair system like...over a year ago now probably, but ended up trashing it due to a combination of getting a new computer, thinking my work was shit, /r/soccer's flair system being to frustrating to figure out, and just general apathy bullshit. 

If there wasn't such a huge huge amount of people the sub wanted to be represented, I could easily make bigger and better flairs like the ones on /r/WrestleWithThePlot or /r/SCJerk, but the problem lies in the CSS having a character limit, which is where /r/soccer's system (and my lack of understanding in it) comes in. We looked into it some more several months back again idk how long, and broncos and Sly actually made progress in understanding it. But then uh...progress just kinda stopped, I think I was supposed to help out some but I don't really remember.

370,"&gt;Is there a way we can show who downvotes posts? Or can the mod team view who downvotes?

No, that isn't how the site works.

&gt;I'm not sure if r/SC is just very harsh on certain comments and comment types, or if we have an issue with downvote trolls

Happens on the entire site. The downvote function is just a shit design, regardless of the ""rules"" stating what it's supposed to be used for, there's legitimately no way to enforce them.

Mojo on the main roster is actually kinda hype and can probably put together a better feud with Rusev than half the people Rusev usually fights.

As for the PMs, we've helped several people in that situation beforel. There's obviously nothing subreddit mods can do to get someone to stop PMing someone else, but we always direct the person to [contact](https://www.reddit.com/contact/) the admins, who are usually very speedy and helpful, and who aren't the biggest fans of harassment type cases.

""WWE Taped their anual Extreme Rules PPV today in Las Vegas, Nevada. Here are the results:

Roman Reigns defeated AJ Styles clean for the WWE Title. The whole match was a 3-1 with The Club trynna beat down Roman, but Roman took charge and destroyed all 2 members with ease. Burying them and winning to retain.

Chris Jericho defeated Dean Ambrose in The Asylum match. Chris Jericho trolled the crowd by not using any weapons, or not using the Steel Cage at all. He kept it a completely clean match, after winning with a Codebreaker.

The New Day vs The Vaudevillians ended in a no contest when Big E irish whipped Aiden English into the ropes, and Aiden hit his head on the apron, getting a concussion, was un-responsive before getting stretchered to the back. Calling off the match.

Charlotte defeated Natalya to retain the Womens Championship. Ric Flair ran out near the end of the match, but as he was running out Bret came out and beat up Ric. It was said that Bret was supposed to then help Natalya win, but Bret wrote the word WCW in the air and walking off.

The Miz retained The IC Title in the Fatal 4 Way. Near the end of the match Sami and KO had been brawling throughout the arena and they ended up leaving in the arena, brawling throughout Las Vegas ending up in the famous MGM Grand Hotel brawling there. As it was left to Cesaro and The Miz, Cesaro had The Crossface applied to the Miz the crowd were going nuts for Cesaro, before Vince McMahon ran out with a mic started yelling at Cesaro that he's not connecting with the crowd, that he's not grabbing the Brass ring, which distracted Cesaro and let Miz hit the Skull Crushing Finale to retain.

Kalisto defeated Ryback to retain the US Title. At the end of the match Rusev had the Accolade locked in on Kalisto before Lana came up on the ring apron and said to Rusev she prefers Lanky little Mexicans over big strong men, Slapped Ryback, Kalisto won with a rollup before Kalisto and Lana made out. This is said that WWE wants to re-inact the Ziggler/Rusev Love Triangle rivalry once again.

The Usos defeat The Club. This was a clean dominant showing from The Usos. The Usos absolutely destroyed and burried The Club. Mirroring what would happen in The Main event.

Dolph Ziggler defeated Baron Corbin when Corbin was setting up for the End of Days when Goldbergs music hit, he ran out and accused Corbin of stealing his gimmick. Then Ryback came out and said Goldberg stole Rybacks gimmick. And then Batista came out and said he started this gimmick. It is being rumoured that at Summerslam we will see a Fatal-4 Way to see the master of the big quit boring man gimmick""",2016-05-22 12:47:07+00:00,d3f4ibq,4.0,t1_d3f4gy4,117.0,SquaredCircle

The reason for IMN not wanting to declare for certain it was the result of one of our accounts being fucked with is just because of the slight possibility of Falcon, or someone else after getting into his account editing the webpage slightly to make the screenshots look like they were from a mods perspective instead of Falcon's.

2. (To the people in the thread) Falcon won't be ""driven away"" by the community because of any negative attention, nor will he start acting like a colossal cunt like Mets because of a bunch of positive attention. He took a huge break from the sub a while back and said (paraphrasing) ""after starting to tell someone in a PM to fuck off I took a good look at myself and decided I didn't need to be taking Reddit this seriously"". I'm sure he'd maintain the same attitude if something similar happened again.

3. Once again to the people in the thread, you don't need to be telling OP to fuck off and being generally rude for having a different opinion. It's perfectly acceptable to have one.

Unfortunately shadowbanning is outside the jurisdiction of any moderator; you will need to contact the admins to resolve this.

783,"Definitely the most excited from Ambrose/Lesnar. Interested to see what happens with HHH and Ambrose before Mania too.

Divas should be better than anything they've done at Mania for who knows how long.

I love me some HHH and even though I'm not a huge Reigns fan or anything he usually has entertaining matches when it comes to big shows with big stars so I'm sure it will be decent too.

Pretty curious to see what New Day/Styles/Jericho end up doing as well as Owens and everyone that usually gets involved with the IC Title/midcard shit because there's nothing really obvious set up yet.",2016-03-02 07:30:02+00:00,d0kh6x2,1.0,t3_48kzim,3061.0,SCJerk

852,"I have a plea. A plea to the TNA fans on /r/SquaredCircle. A very specific section of TNA fans, in particular.

[This is a link to this weeks live TNA thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/44z5zk/live_tna_impact_discussion_thread_2916/) It was stickied 20ish minutes before the show started, as it has been the last few weeks as well. [This is a link to the Total Divas thread from the same hour.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/450blt/live_total_divas_thread_2_9_16/) The Total Divas thread didn't even make the front page, and almost has as many comments as the TNA thread.

Now, using this as evidence, this is for those of you who have recently taken to going around reporting every WWE thread that gets stickied ""The TNA thread wasn't stickied because of an AMA, but this is? Hypocrisy much?"" And so on. I don't particularly like it when people treat TNA like an absolute joke of a company, and just make the lowest of effort ""LOLTNA"" jokes, but face the facts and admit that it's clearly the least respected and watched ""major"" company on the sub. That's not to say they don't have a talented roster or anything, but there's been a lot of bullshit turn people off of TNA over the years that distract from the fact that there's tons of entertaining things about TNA. EC3 has more fans here than TNA in general. I've been a big Abyss fan for a LONG time. Everyone loved the ""Divas Revolution"" last year, but TNA's women probably had an even better year, but few know about it. 

*That all being said*...look at the state of the subs interest in the company, and try to understand if there's multiple big announcements or something and a thread doesn't get stickied, please. It's not like there's a lack of effort. Look at the work /u/inmynothing puts in to get these dope TNA amas once a month. The EC3 ones are some of the best we've had, Tyrus straight up fucking posts here like a normal dude, and yet it seems like it doesn't do fuck all for promotion. If you're a TNA fan on Wreddit don't be discouraged by shitposting and stuff, make threads about it, participate in threads about it, try to introduce people to cool aspects of the show, show some passion in the way that /u/Blee10 does for NXT, or how /u/evandeadlysins does for NJPW.

I dunno how to end this shit. I could keep ranting but don't know where to go. Not writing a TL;DR if you're too lazy to read go read something else.

871,"Yes, that is what happens; but it does nothing, nor do any of the other options as long as the person continues to want to shitpost.

Option 1- Regular, good old perma-ban: Person's notified instantly, and can immediately make a new account if they feel the urge to continue.

Option 2 (my favorite) - Automod ban: Put the person into an automod command that removes everything they post without notification, and *hope* they never notice that their posts don't show up. If/once they do however, it's once again back to a new account.

Option three- Ask the useless admins to do something: They take forever to respond, rescind shadowbans for no reason, and their one way of dealing with the problem is easily worked around.

Basically the idea is without some sort of content control people will complain more and more about ""shitposts"" until the sub is universally regarded in the same way as places like /r/funny or /r/gaming. Deleting posts that are just like...a screenshot of a sign in the audience that says ""/r/SquaredCircle"" is one way to do that. First, there was probably 10 other people doing the same, hoping to post it for easy karma as well, and secondly, there's probably a discussion thread with most of the people that would care about it anyway already discussing it.

But I'm off on a tangent here. Long story short: some people like discussion, some people like gifs, others like memes. It's hard as fuck to balance a subreddit out to become the place that people will enjoy visiting for different reasons, but some rules are just required for that to take place.

Also, for what it's worth regarding ""the only difference between the two is posting a link in a text box vs just uploading the picture"", if someone posts solely the url of their already deleted link post into a self post, without elaborating on it in someway to create discussion, it's deleted as well.

946,"&gt;I feel full matches on Dailymotion/Youtube helps the product by getting more eyes on it, therefore gaining interest from the casual fans.

This is basically how I feel. The piracy debate's one people are going to be able to go back and forth on for ages, and I know a lot of people hate this arguement, but in my mind people who watch streams/dailymotion videos/download torrents were never going to pay for the product in the first place, and that it doesn't actually cost the companies any money. Maybe there's a slight chance that after viewing the material a bunch they end up liking it enough that they do end up purchasing it in the future.

All promotions are always featured here. The difference is there isn't *nearly* as much content for the other shows. For example, I fucking love ROH, but there's just a single 1 hour show per week. If there were 5 ROH shows, along with an entire network with original programming, and related reality shows on other networks, I'm sure they would be talked about.

A shadowban is a site wide ban (or subreddit specific if an automod command is used, but don't worry about that) that the user is unaware of. The user's able to post, but they don't show up to anyone other than the mods of the sub that the post is on. This happens to spammers and for random shitty reasons the admins are unclear about. That's why sometimes you'll see me or other mods approve a shadowbanned user's comments and tell him ways to get un-shadowbanned, because if they're just going around trying to comment like a normal user they probably didn't deserve it.

First off, I agree.

Moving on, I felt the need to clarify something that was addressed in modmail. You asked us who the original creator of this sub was, and these nerds all gave you various answers. Well, I'm here to let you in on the truth.

Vince McHitler originally created this subreddit, shortly after reaching out to the /r/SquaredCircle mods about pushing WWE content on that sub and providing them money for doing so. He thought that if *this* sub existed, there would be less negativitiy towards the WWE on /r/SquaredCircle. Using this sub as a sort of containment board; for example, more ""fuck Sheamus"" here, and less over there.

I've personally spent a lot of time recently blacklisting the accounts of a certain user who has made *at least* 6 different accounts solely for the purpose of trolling.

I look at the mod-queue all the time and see everything the community reports. If someone is being a dickhead it's usually going to be deleted, and if they're doing it continually we talk about it, and decide to either else give them a warning, or ban them.

Like /u/kentucky210 said, we can't magically see /u/falconarrow's messages, but we'd be more than happy to ban people that were harassing him in them if he felt like showing them to us. Shit, so would the admins, they're not exactly to kind on harassment situations recently. As another user said, admins are probably the better answer in a situation like this anyway, as an IP ban can be a lot more effective. A similar situation happened with /u/SxeRpw a few days ago, he told us about it, showed us the PMs, and the harassing user was banned. 

Of course, there's no ""well done, mods"" when this happens, because we just [do it for free,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdC_Cu9X4wc) and there aren't giant threads that chronicle all the things that are handled quick and smoothly.

1809,"I met Shawn Michaels at a restaurant once - we’d accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that).

Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says “I’m so sorry, but we’d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we’ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you’d like while you’re in town.” My sister and cousin were both like “Yeah that’s cool.” and I kind of played the asshole a bit.

""I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. We’ve been here for 15 minutes - we’ve just ordered. Can’t we finish our meal here?""

Then out of nowhere Shawn Michaels shows up next to the manager and says “Paul, these guys can finish. We’ll be at the bar. I got some time.”

And I (being a big HBK fan) said “Oh wow, uh… I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.”

Shawn was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget.

He was banned for a week, as a warning. Here is the message he was sent:

""Hi!

I noticed a report and went through some of your comment history and at least a couple times it's seemed you've posted something purely to get a reaction from someone else. That's trolling. This is trolling:

   &gt;I don't think you're stupid. I don't think you're an idiot. Hell, I don't even think you're a retard, despite my previous post, which was solely done to bait a response from you.

Please don't do this. You're a generally good member of the community, but the aforementioned kind of behavior isn't very good.

Thanks!""

It was a lot more polite than I probably would have been, considering how much of a toxic dickhead he is. Leaving this entire thread up is probably questionable in it's own right, since this sub isn't actually /r/TalkAboutGettingBannedFromSquaredCircle, but fuck it right?
