__________________________________________________________________________________________


Anyway with that out of the way, lets move on to [this shirt.](http://i.imgur.com/exOXH4z.jpg) I received it in the mystery box of shirts and for the first time in my life found myself looking at Roman Reigns' logo, and wondering what in the fuck it's supposed to be.

Here's a brief rundown of my initial thoughts:

""It's two Rs...because Roman Reigns right?""

""But what the fuck is in the middle? A vampire stake? Did Roman ever have a vampire hunter gimmick, and I somehow missed it?""

""A railroad spike maybe? Wait why the shit would there be a railroad spike""

Anyway this lead me to using the internet, which we all know is full of such helpful information, to look and see what other people had to say about the logo in the past. This threw a new kink into things, when most of what I found was people saying it resembled a spider. This blew my mind. It did look like a spider, how the fuck did I never see it before? I found year old threads [comparing it to Spiderman](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/2yj3ej/why_is_roman_reigns_logo_a_spider_merch/) [and an old Jeff Hardy logo.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/2q9yy3/did_they_really_have_to_take_romans_logo_from_the/) [I even found this website](http://www.romanreignswwe.net/roman-reigns-logo/), which goes into way too much effort to try to convince me that it actually is supposed to be a spider, but my spirit will not waver. There's no way it can be a spider, why the fuck would it be a spider?

So I take one more long look at the shirt. I put it on, I back up and look at it from a distance in the mirror. My mind is blown. It's a kite shield. Turns out, Roman Reigns was in a little known group of wrestlers called ""The Shield"", and his logo happens to still be (if you can belee dat) a shield.

There very well may be people on Reddit that have mentioned this before. I tried searching, but Reddit's search is ass and all I could find were [a few comments in this thread calling one of his shirts terrible](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/2bxuvv/new_roman_reigns_tshirt_its_uhwell_its_something/) (which is also full of spiderman/hardy boy references btw) and those few comments are downvoted and no one else other than the few posters seem to see the light.

[Take a look at a kite shield.](http://i.imgur.com/59UiNt8.jpg) They were almost always designed with a cross, or a dragon, or something else down the middle, and had a reverse teardrop shape identical to the logo. I must admit, I still have no fucking idea what the thing in the middle of Reigns' logo is (my money's still on vampire stake) but I absolutely am certain that it is intended to be combined with the two Rs to look like a kite shield.

I am aware I have too much time on my hands.


**TL;DR: Fuck your spiders, and fuck your Hardy Boys, Roman's logo is *a* shield because he was in *the* shield. Also possibly a vampire hunter.**

**edit: alright shout out to /u/C0RNL0RD, /u/TPower1990, and /u/Dethgar helping me gain confidence in my final thesis. Definitely a shield with the shit in the middle being the end of a spear.

##**About Taya Valkyrie**##
***

Taya Valkyrie has only relatively recently became involved in the world of professional wrestling, training with Lance Storm in 2010, participating in his series *World of Hurt*, and then going on to wrestle in several indie companies in Canada.

After signing a developmental deal with the WWE in 2011, she never officially competed with the company, and found herself in Mexico shortly later, and eventually debuting with AAA in November of 2012. After a few solid years with the company, she really started to rise in 2014, when she won an elimination match to become the number one contender for the Reina de Reinas Championship, and won the title a month later at Triplemania XXX, against Faby Apache.

In 2016, she debuted in Lucha Underground as the valet of Johnny Mundo, making her in-ring debut a few weeks later in a defeat to Cage. She had her revenge however, eliminating Cage in the second edition of Aztec Warfare, before being eliminated herself by Fenix. Who knows what's in store for her this next season, and tomorrow you'll have a chance to ask, only a hour before the season starts!

Well good question [](/haitch """") 

Since Summerslam is **4 FUCKING HOURS LONG** and there are **10 FUCKING MATCHES ON THE MAIN CARD** we have decided to save Reddit's servers and break down the live thread to 2 parts. Part 2 (which is here) will feature the last **5** matches. Part 1 featured the first **5** matches, but you probably could have figured that out.

There will be Post match discussion threads for each match when it's finished and also a Post show thread when the show is over.

**About Son of Havoc**

___________________________________________________

Formally known as Matthew ""Matt"" Capiccioni, you may recognize Son of Havoc from various companies he's spent time in during the beginning of his wrestling career. He first took the name M-Dogg 20, as a fan of backyard wrestling, and used this name while competing in companies such as Xtreme Pro Wrestling and CZW. He then debuted in Ring of Honor as Matt Cross in 2006, where he had several notable matches with the likes of Christopher Daniels, Bryan Danielson, Austin Aries, and many others. In 2011, he joined WWE's Tough Enough, hosted by Stone Cold, but he was eliminated in just the second week.

In Lucha Underground, Matthew has gone by the name Son of Havoc, and has been a star in the company since the first week, where he defeated Sexy Star. He was originally managed by Ivelisse, but after a series of tough losses the couple's relationship got rockier by the minute, and they finally broke up. A strange relationship later formed however, between the two and Angélico, and the three went on a great run of victories to win the first ever LU Trio's Championship.

Also, he did an AMA near the end of season 1 of Lucha Underground on /r/IAmA, feel free to check out that thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3f2rtp/i_am_son_of_havoc_from_lucha_underground_on_el/)

No idea what happened tbh. https://www.reddit.com/user/J7x This account was randomly modded, and I thought it was weird due to the whole...completely out of the blue, Slobberknocker actually doing something after being inactive constantly thing, plus the account having no history.

These shows have many attractions, including Mascara Dorada's last NJPW matches before returning to CMLL after his one-year contract expires, Young Lions Yohei Komatsu and Sho Tanaka's last NJPW matches before heading to CMLL for their learning excursion, and five CMLL championship matches.

At the time /r/ProWrestling had something like 2,500 subscribers.  And while I thought I could create a community that would exceed that, I never thought there was actually a large group of wrestling fans on Wreddit.  I expected to maybe get 5,000 at the time we are now and I was ok with that.  I just wanted a place where the small collection of those people could mark out. 

Now we sit on the verge of 2255.  2 god damn thousand.  That blows my mind.  We've beaten the /r/WWE attendance record with that.   We're one of the more active and popular Sheamus communities on Reddit. No where near the top, but still. And dare I say we've become the one of biggest and best wrestling communities on the internet. 

We've gotten the attention of countless people in the industry.  We're eventually going to have a Frank the Clown AMA. In the time it's been around I've seen CM Punks career soar and end. I grew to love so many new guys and cheer them on as their careers exploded.  I've seen legends pass and new stars develop. I saw the rise of Eva Marie, the return and instant death of Daniel Bryan, and for a week this place **loved** Roman Reigns quotes.

On a personal level I've gotten to do and see things I'd never imagined.  I've talked to the likes of Frank the Clown, Savio Vega guy, and even the legendary emobatman. The later two I've actually got a chance to meet and speak to. Frank told me his theories on MetsFan, and emo was awesome enough to record a video for the gift exchange.  I started going to local shows and made several friends there. I watched /u/Crooty , one of the guys I started this place with, chase his dream of becoming a fuccboi and fucking *nail* it.  He's doing amazing work in his basement and is one of the stars of the whole promotion. That's *amazing* and I wouldn't get to experience that, or any of this, if we didn't start this place.  

Shameddt isn't without it's growing pains or drama, and there's been challenges that stressed me more then I ever expected.  The stress this place has given me is more then I think a lot of people understand.  But it's worth it.  No matter how good or bad the product is, and no matter how crazy, hectic, or stressful this place is this is the most fun I've ever had in my near 20 years as a wrestling fan.  

So truly, *thank you*.  Every one of you.  From /u/kentucky210  and /u/SLOBBERKNOCKER316, the guys that help me create this place, all the way down to the countless idiots I've banned, the entire current mod team, and the TWOS OF THOUSANDS of youwho made this place their home for wrestling.  I am immeasurably proud of what we've created here and it's all because of every one of you.

This has become one of the PPV's marquee match ups and since it has the mods of /r/arrow and /r/squaredcircle have decided to do a cross-over event to help familiarize each subreddit with the eachother's product. 

I am one of /r/Squaredcircle's mods and come here with a little bit more info for you guys along with providing this thread which can be used to answer questions. We are directing a lot of our sub to also come here and try and answer questions to the best of their ability

**Neville**: Neville is Stephen's tag team partner and goes by many names. **The Man that Gravity Forgot, The New Sensation and the Leader of the Altitude Era** Neville is most known for his high flying nature. Neville is basically a comic book character when you see him wrestle due to the fact he does moves you cannot even believe are possible. 

Perhaps the biggest example of this is Neville's finisher which is named The Red Arrow. The Red Arrow is a shooting star press (a wrestler is on the top rope and does a flip) mixed with a 450. [You can see that move used in this gif](http://i.imgur.com/by7j5J1.gif). I'll leave out some of his other moves for you guys to be surprised and witness live :)

**Stardust**: Stardust is....well he's...

Ok. To get Stardust you have to understand his backstory. You see Stardust is like any good villain in that regard. Stardust used to wrestle as Cody Rhodes. Cody is a part of a famous wrestling family, his brother Golddust was a huge star in the 1990's to mid 2000's and was known for being very eccentric [Witness this entrance to get a feel of the Golddust character](https://youtu.be/3j9KFh_5cDs?t=1m26s). His father Dusty Rhodes was known simply as the American Dream and is one of the most important wrestlers in the history of the business. Cody Rhodes broke into the business in the mid 2000's and never quite found his niche. His father was a trailblazer, his brother played one of the weirdest characters ever but Cody was just....Cody. In mid 2013 Cody was in story-line fired. His brother and him teamed up and along with help from their dad won Cody his job back along with his brother getting a job again. Cody and Golddust would team up and eventually would win the tag titles. After dropping them they went on a losing streak until Cody told his brother he needed a better partner. 

[Enter Stardust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe9lPFOWaiA). The self described **King of the Cosmos** Stardust is a recall to his brother's character but goes way farther behind that. He is basically a prototypical comic book villain. Even to a point in which Stardust has declared that his other persona, Cody Rhodes is dead.

**King Barrett**: King Barret/Bad News Barrett/ Wade Barrett is a character which loves delivering Bad News to his opponents whether it be in the ring or via his [podium](https://38.media.tumblr.com/f568b4ffd1f6b70b55829af0f94637fe/tumblr_myng3zBWPC1srbyoyo1_400.gif). Barrett recently won the King of the Ring tournament and as such as declared himself King Barrett. Together the King of Cosmos and the King of the Ring will look to spoil and Green and Red Arrow's plans this Sunday at Summerslam.

---

So what is Summerslam? Summerslam is one of WWE's biggest event's in the year (With only Wrestlemania being ahead of it). This year Summerslam is even bigger due to the fact it has increased one hour and will be 4 hours this year. 

What are other matches I may want to know about? There are 2 matches you should know before going into watch it. **Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker** These are 2 names which many of you, even if you aren't wrestling fans, have probably heard of. Brock Lesnar is a former NCAA Divison I wrestling champion and is a former UFC Heavyweight champion. The Undertaker is a phenom who has been wrestling for over 20 years. Undertaker until Wrestlemania 30 (basically the Superbowl of wrestling) was undefeated. That was until he faced Brock Lesnar who defeated the undertaker much to surprise of everyone. After a year and half the Undertaker is back for vengeance. The other match features the World Title **Seth Rollins (champion) vs. John Cena**. You may know Cena from the prank call and meme status he has achieved (AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA) however Cena is a very dominant wrestler and has been for quite sometime. John Cena has pretty much been the face of the company for just shy of 10 years now and is one title away from tying the record for most world title reigns ever (Ric Flair had 16 world title reigns while Cena right now has 15). He faces a man in Seth Rollins who is not only the current world champion but a man who just a couple weeks ago [broke his nose in the ring](https://33.media.tumblr.com/316e5f995cf8077c75d6a7eb1c41f112/tumblr_ns6haaaw2s1rnjfjfo1_r1_400.gif).

Where/how do I watch Summerslam? You can just Summerslam live on the WWE Network which usually costs 9.99. **However** This month you are allowed to try the network out for free! All you have to do is go to WWE.com find the sign up page for the network and get the free trial there.

So that's just a quick summary of what to expect this Sunday but I'm sure it didn't answer all of your questions. So if you have any further questions about anything in wrestling ask down below. This is no judgement zone, no question is stupid whether it be a very basic or very complex question so ask away!

One more thing on the charity front: /u/oreomega456 created [this awesome art](https://i.imgur.com/Z5F6r5k.jpg) for us to use in the sidebar for /r/SquaredCircle, and is [selling prints on his redbubble.](http://www.redbubble.com/people/oreomega95) He's giving all the proceeds to the same charity as Amell, so feel free to check that out as well.

Last and final thing, /u/kentucky210 wrote most of this thread and I'm just posting it for him, so feel free to direct any typo complaints or things of that nature towards him ;)

Personally, I thought he'd be interesting to have here because of the documentary he's working with which sounds incredible, but if no one is going to give him a chance then I'm not going to fuck with it.

I'll stand by my assertion that he's a nice guy and not the prick you guys think he is based on my conversations with him, but it's not worth the drama.

A main issue brought up on the subreddit has been the Fuck Sheamus policy, specifically titles of posts containing them. 

After having plenty of circlejerking from users over the last few weeks, we have come to a solution that will make the titles better for all the circlejerk.

---

###Spoiler Titles

&amp;amp;gt;Titles must include information on the show it is spoiling, so circlejerk can decide if it relates to them or not.

An example of a bad title would be [RAW Spoiler] Owens Loses Clean To Cena Again.

Titles that don't indicate the show will be terminated on sight and must be reposted with an improved title and two valid forms of government-issued ID. 

Another thing to note is Past Spoilers, posts regarding previous info such as show tapings and Outsider info must be tagged as Past Spoilers. The thing it is spoiling must still be indicated. In regards to semi-plausible spoilers such as Apter Mags, we are torn over this. Check the bottom of this post for more.

Example of the future spoiler formatting would be [Past Spoilers] TSURUTAWINSLOL!

---

###Posts tagged as spoilers after the 24 hour window

Our policy is the keep the front page as spoiler free as possible for 24 hours after a shows airing. During this spoiler rules are in effect. This is a reasonable amount of time for users to catch up on Fuck Sheamus, Eva Marie Sucks, LOLTNA etc.

If however a post is submitted after this window expires including [Spoiler LOLTNA] for example in the title, the post will be removed. The user will then be asked to repost without spoiler tagging the post and having a less vague title.

The window of 24 hours is finished and there is no need to be vague about your submission.

---

###Spoilers inside threads

Spoilers are fine inside threads marked clearly in the title. However, ALL spoilers not related to the thread must be marked with the spoiler tagging. 

For example, an upcoming taping result in a thread not regarding that taping will be removed and the user could risk being temporarily banned or banned entirely.

To tag a spoiler in the comments, use the following formatting that is now also usable for mobile users.


    [Show Name Spoiler](/s ""Fuck Sheamus!"")

For Example:

     [RAW Spoiler](/s ""Eva Marie Sucks"")

gives [RAW Spoiler](/s ""Eva Marie Sucks"")

---

###Apter Mag Status as Future Spoilers

Like we mentioned above, we are split in regards to kayfabe info on future events such as Apter Mags or 1-900 Hotlines. **Should they require a future spoiler tag?** This is why we would like to circlejerk in regards to this and then a decision regarding this will be made.

Almost every week since i was 3 years old I've watched raw, smackdown,ppv's and whatever else the wwe put on television ,usually watching it live despite living in the uk and having to stay up till 4am to see the end of raw. Despite other promotions doing certain aspects of wrestling better and the decline in the wwe's quality over the years I've stuck with them but battleground changed that for me.

I like regularly seeing new,entertaining wrestlers getting their push to the main event and becoming the new faces of the company, it's one of the most exciting parts of being a wrestling fan however the wwe doesn't really excel at this. There are so many times I've watched the wwe mess up a push or squander the talents of a wrestler such as bray wyatt,rusev or cm punk early in his career by jobbing them to some aging veteran or by giving the old has-beens unnecessary main event spots instead of developing talents that are still in their prime that I feel like it is now the norm in wwe and as a result I find it hard to stay invested in the product.

Due to this I didn't expect much from battleground. I enjoyed seeing sasha banks and charlotte having their first main roster match however I stopped taking the divas seriously years ago due to wwe's handling of women's wrestling and I still don't feel optimistic about the divas division. I knew taker was likely returning which I figured would result in seth rollins retaining despite losing the match because nothing makes a champion look stronger than having him retain purely due to blind luck.

The one match i thought might give me that thrill of seeing a new wrestler ascending to the main event was kevin owens vs john cena. Since cena has displayed excellent ring work the last several months outside of the main event and owens has done an exceptional job as a heel i was hoping to see owens win and move on to a feud with another high profile star and for cena to continue having good matches while shifting further into the role of the veteran putting over young talent.

As anyone who watched battleground knows cena made owens tap out clean in the middle of the ring. This means that owens despite one previous win against cena has now lost twice cleanly to him and given that both rusev and bray wyatt both got a single win against cena during their feuds despite thoroughly losing the overall feud and fading back to midcard status it feels like a token win. This combined with a fifty year old undertaker returning makes me feel like the wwe will only ever pay lip service to pushing new talent and that fifteen years down the line it'll still be the same and i'll be watching the likes of orton and cena dominating the main event scene as part timers well into their fifties.

I'm sick of the constant disappointment.I'm sick of the wwe taking veterans who I loved watching in years past and trotting them out well past their prime to have subpar matches on major ppv's at the expense of young, incredible talents who work hard all year just to get onto those shows let alone to be in the main event. I'm sick of the wwe being too lazy to push these young guys properly and i'm sick of hearing people justifying the inclusion of these has-beens by saying they have name value and the young guys don't.

It is the job of the wwe to make new stars and to make them look strong so that they can draw viewers and for years they haven't bothered. they've instead relied on members of the bald spot brigade such as sting,taker, the nwo, hbk, the rock and triple h to face their longtime main eventers at their ppv's and i don't see that ever changing so i am cancelling my network subscription and i'm done with the wwe.

I know this all sounds really negative but I want to see new wrestlers get a few years at the top and i'm done with watching people I idolized while growing up having horrible matches well after they should've gracefully retired. I still love wrestling and i'm going to continue watching njpw, roh and the independents and discussing wrestling a bit on reddit but I can't justify spending my time and money on the wwe anymore.

I'm not going to respond to anything in the comments since they won't affect my decision to stop watching, and I realize this doesn't matter much since i'm just one irrelevant fan and no doubt most people enjoyed battleground and will likely downvote this post to hell but I really needed to let that out and I feel a lot better after typing this. I'm not quite sure how to end this and it's 6am here so i'm just going to stop here.
