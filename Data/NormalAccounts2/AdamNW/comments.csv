I still haven't gotten a legendary but two people in my raid group each have two. Even if I DID get a legendary there's a pretty good chance it's not even going to be a good one for my spec. The power disparity between a spec's best legendary and worst legendary is just ridiculous. [This video](http://youtu.be/R7hXuNaCWVM) pretty accurately describes the experience. According to Blizz, the first tier of raids do not factor in legendary gear in balancing, so it's not a big deal now, but it's still upsetting to know so many people have several while I don't have one.

As a jewel crafter, I also think prospecting RNG is just awful right now, but that's partially because of the current state of the auction house. Felslate, the rare ore that produces better quality gems, is selling for upwards of 100g per unit. I bought 100 felslate (10k total) and didn't get a single rare quality gem, when I needed at least 3 to break even. Right now it doesn't feel worth it to do any sort of jewelcrafting because selling the felslate instead is so much more worth it.  This is going to be remedied in the next patch though, because they're introducing a new way to get profession mats.

Thankfully the content itself is so damn good. We've been raiding Emerald Nightmare and I love every boss. The dungeons are really fun and Mythic+ adds such a new dynamic to them. I also ran through the new Karazhan in the PTR client and it's possibly the best 5man content I've played period. Suramar is a wonderful questing experience (not so much for world quests though) as well. Just the base content alone is better than anything I played from Warlords.

Anyhow, Reynad made the comment about how the card nerfs mean that the main decks that could compete with shaman got nerfed enough that overall, Shaman became even more powerful.  [According to Tempostorm](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2016-09-18), the decks he specifically mentioned have the following winrates against Shaman:

* Maly Druid: 40-45%
* Tempo Mage: 50-55%
* Dragon Warrior: 45-60% (Beats Aggro)
* Token Druid: 40-50%
* Control Warrior: 30-60% (Beats Aggro)
* Hunter: ~35-45%
* Zoolock: 40-55% (Beats Aggro)
* OTK Warrior: 35-60% (Beats Midrange)
* C'Thun Warrior: 40-60% (Beats Aggro)
* Patron Warrior: 35-60% (Beats Aggro)

So yeah, a lot of these decks are losing quite a bit due to the nerfs.  It actually makes me worried overall if Reynad ends up being right about the impact of these nerfs.",2016-09-29 03:28:32+00:00,d86gzqf,1.0,t3_5504ra,2911.0,hearthstone

Right, but if the stigma was removed regarding herpes, this wouldn't be an issue.

293,"From their article about the law itself:

&gt; The proposed law requires that:

&gt; • Employers give workers 14 days’ advance notice of schedules.

&gt; • Workers get a minimum 10 hours between shifts — unless they consent to having less rest between shifts. In that case, they would be paid time and a half for the hours that make the shifts separated by less than 10 hours.

&gt; • Employers pay workers one hour of “predictability pay” for changes to the schedule after it’s been posted.

&gt; There are exceptions for employee-initiated shift swaps or shift coverage, or if an employer fills an unexpectedly open shift by using “mass communications” such as text or email to ask workers if they can fill the shift.

&gt; • Workers who don’t get all the hours for which they’ve been scheduled get paid half of their hourly wage for each hour cut.

&gt; • Workers be paid half their hourly wage for each hour they’re scheduled to work on-call but are not called in.

&gt; • Employers offer additional hours to existing employees, posting the notice for at least three days and giving workers two days to accept an offer, before they can hire new workers.

&gt; “External hiring can begin earlier if the employer receives confirmation that all qualified internal candidates decline additional hours,” according to the city’s presentation.

&gt; Exceptions include seasonal hiring and participation in diversity and young-adult hiring programs.

* King's Elekk (probably) draws you a card you'll want to play in the next several turns.
* Sorcerer's Apprentice enables you to cast spells for cheap. You can easily remove anything your opponent plays before it challenges the Apprentice.

* Totem Golem is a 3/4
* Armorsmith is difficult to remove and it generates armor when you try to.
* Dark Peddler has the discover mechanic

571,"**Prologue:** A few years ago during the MTV Video Music Awards, Taylor Swift won an award that both she and Beyonce were nominated for. I want to say this was a year or two after Taylor first became big and iirc it was her first MTV award.  Anyway, during her acceptance speech, Kanye went up on stage, stole the mic from her, and said Beyonce deserved that award. It was one of the biggest music-drama news stories back then.

**Chapter 1:** Kanye releases Famous, which includes the line ""I think me and Taylor might still have sex. Why? I made that bitch famous."" Fairly controversial but whatever it's Kanye. Taylor Swift won a Grammy right after that song came out and called Kanye out on the line, (if I'm understanding correctly) basically saying it was uncalled for.

**Chapter 2:** Kim Kardashian posted a video of a phone conversation between Kanye and Taylor on social media a couple days ago. The conversation was before Famous dropped, and basically showed that Taylor gave Kanye full consent to use that line in the song. She basically did this because of Taylor's comments at the Grammys to show that Taylor is full of shit.

I noticed in your replay that you were inputting EX fireball almost every time you threw one, whether or not you had the meter.  I can't really help you there other than saying it's a habit you absolutely need to break. Just keep your mind on the meter goal.

&gt; With Fang I actually can't really avoid it i guess until I get my defense down. I need his EX dash thingy for a safe escape from the corner.

Be careful about this too.  FANG's V-Reversal does the same thing and it's much less resource intensive.

895,"Idk what the move is called but the special where he throws his hands up and moves at you caught you every single time. It's very easy to just neutral jump to dodge it. Depending on the spacing you can also EX fireball him out of it but for now, learn to dodge it first.  It has one hit of armor so most attacks will just get absorbed.

I would recommend not using EX moves at all outside of combos, and I would try to shake the habit of using them.  I don't know about FANG but Ryu doesn't really gain much from them, and certainly not against Gief.  EX fireball is good when you're in a fireball war, but that's not the case.  EX Shoryuken (I could be wrong) also does little for you besides the extra damage. You mentioned yourself that you can't CA because you waste your meter, so I would challenge you to play a few matches where you don't use your meter at *all* except for CA.

Additionally, your spacing needs some work. All your fireballs are going to do at full screen are waste time while Zangief forward jumps through them. You have a couple options here:

* Dash in during his jump and try to go for something aggressive while the space is closed.
* Play the fireball game from about half to 3/4ths the distance you were, to make his defensive options a little more awkward

Also, be careful about your hit confirms. I saw you try to do a ~~jab link~~ forward fierce? into DP, which is a good combo but easily punished if blocked. Go into training mode and turn on random blocking, then train yourself to not DP if the first hit of the fierce is blocked. It's exceptionally difficult to get the hang of at first, but it will click in time.

Finally, don't wakeup DP the first couple knockdowns. He conditioned you not to do it because he saw it coming from the get go, but the key is to make him think it isn't coming at all.  Most Silver+ players know already to watch for it at the start, but will forget about it if they don't see you do it.

Let me know if you have any questions. I know Zangief is a scary dude to face but with proper spacing and practice he is easy to shut down.

EDIT: You did a good job dodging the dash-in SPD at the end of the second round but you missed your punish.  Try to work on your BnB combos from air attacks. I'm pretty sure j.MK is Ryu's best air normal for starting a combo but I could be wrong.

Also, as a general note, try to work on your quick rises.",2016-06-22 08:54:08+00:00,d4j5rfo,2.0,t1_d4imqp7,36957.0,StreetFighter

897,"&gt; What is the second plan you're referring to here? 

I was speaking hypothetically.  We don't know what the second plan was because there wasn't a need for one.  The first plan worked.

&gt; I would say that he was destined to have a stuck up mentor who wouldn't look at the already effectively dead city and manage the situation. It seems that was one of the many pieces that led to Arthas being baited to Northrend. 

That may be, but that just goes further to show that it isn't Uther's fault.  If Arthas was always destined to be taught by a bad mentor (a sentiment I disagree with but am willing to concede for the sake of argument), Uther could have been replaced by literally any other person, and the result would have been the same.

Besides, it was Arthas himself that decided to go to Northrend and meet his destiny.  Or, he was bound to head there regardless of the circumstance.  Either way, Uther's actions had no bearing on it.  You're faulting Uther for something he literally could not control.

&gt; Any mentor wise enough to be teaching the prince would have seen right through the trap. Perhaps if Arthas was led to believe it was a trap instead of cowardice, he wouldn't have gone.

You really think anyone would have known it was a trap? I don't see how you're reaching this conclusion.  Can you explain?",2016-06-22 05:57:19+00:00,d4j2b8l,5.0,t1_d4j1qnw,1420.0,changemyview
898,"I would need to replay WC3 to further explain the point, but I think the [encounter with Mal'Ganis during the Culling of Stratholme in WoW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmN3040a-aI) is evidence enough that you're wrong.  Here's a key set of dialog form the end of the fight:

&gt; Mal'Ganis: Your journey has just begun, young prince...Gather your forces, and meet me in the arctic land of Northrend...It is there we shall settle the score between us...**It is there that your true destiny will unfold...**

&gt; Arthas: I'll hunt you to the ends of the earth if I have to.  Do you hear me? To the ends of the earth!

This says to me two things: That Arthas's determination to destroy the scourge would have overpowered him no matter what happened.  Even if Uther had assisted Arthas, there's simply no way the resolution would have been enough for him.  He is simply too hell-bent on vengeance.  The other thing is that he was always fated to become bound to Frostmourne.  At the end of the Human campaign, if you recall, Mal'Ganis is slain by Arthas, but **only because Arthas was commanded by the Lich King to do so**.  Mal'Ganis was being used as a puppet in order to bait Arthas to Northrend.  If the first plan failed, the second one wouldn't have.  The Lich King's power is simply too incredible for that.",2016-06-22 05:17:51+00:00,d4j1c7j,3.0,t1_d4j0jnp,1750.0,changemyview

1016,"Imagine you get knocked down.  You have well over 8 frames to decide what action you want to take on wake up.  I can begin blocking the moment I start to wake up, or start inputting the actions for a reversal if I wanted to.  If I time it correctly they will all come out on the first frame after my wake up is over.  Literally all I need to do to 0f block is hold block during my wake up and I'll be blocking correctly.

If your chosen action has start up frames though, it still has to go through the start up frames before it's active. If my block has 1-2 frames of startup, I'm guaranteed to be open for those frames unable to do anything.  It doesn't matter what my input lag is at that point.  Every properly timed meaty attack will hit me and there would be nothing I can do about it, unless my character has a reversal.

Speaking of reversals, since they have invincibility properties, I would have no way to bait them without telegraphing my block.  Meaties, throws, even most cross ups don't work depending on the reversal.  The end result of adding startup to blocking would be a game dominated by characters who have meterless reversals. Throws become worthless because combos always do more damage and reversals beat throws anyway.

tl;dr the game would be dominated by Ryu, Ken, Guile, Cammy, and Necalli as they're the only characters who would be able to defend themselves from being perpetually knocked down.

1021,"&gt; Yeah there was definitely an implication that Tracer isn't allowed to be sexy because she's the spunky one. Like upbeat women aren't allowed to be complex enough to be sexy sometimes too.

I see where you're coming from.  The way I understood the complaint was that Over the Shoulder wasn't spunky or upbeat, which made the sexiness that much more apparent (or worse depending on your perspective).

This is why I'm so happy with the new pose.  It shows that Tracer *can* be sexy while still being true to her character.

1022,"Kaplan himself said this:

&gt; While I stand by my previous comment, I realize I should have been more clear. As the game director, I have final creative say over what does or does not go into the game. With this particular decision, it was an easy one to make—not just for me, but for the art team as well. **We actually already have an alternate pose that we love and we feel speaks more to the character of Tracer. We weren't entirely happy with the original pose, it was always one that we wrestled with creatively. That the pose had been called into question from an appropriateness standpoint by players in our community did help influence our decision—getting that kind of feedback is part of the reason we're holding a closed beta test—but it wasn't the only factor.** We made the decision to go with a different pose in part because we shared some of the same concerns, but also because we wanted to create something better.

The pose was changed within days after the initial complaint as well, so I'm inclined to believe him when he says this.  So on that note:

&gt; but if they stuck with the old pose instead, it wouldnt have been ""out of character."" Because they fucking made her character.

Kaplan himself said they didn't like the original pose.  In fact, it was probably going away regardless of the complaints of the original poster.  Yes, they made the character, and they have every right to change it however they want to, no matter what people have to say about it.

You should explain it to me then, because I have no idea what you're talking about.

I also never said anything to suggest that Widowmaker has to be sexualized just because she's evil, or vice versa.  I can see why it'd be lazy/overdone, but it's certainly not misogynistic within the context of the argument we're trying to have.

No, but it defines Widowmaker.  Tracer doesn't *have* to be a silly goofy character but Blizz decided she should be, so she is.  Likewise, Blizz decided Widowmaker would be a sexy femme fatale character, so she is.

&gt; I still don't see how its ok for her daughter to see widow makers outfit, but tracer to have a hot shot victory pose.

The complaint was never about the daughter being exposed to sexualized female characters.  It's about her being exposed *only* to sexualized female characters.  The poster literally says this:

This pose says to the player base, oh we’ve got all these cool diverse characters, but at any moment we are willing to reduce them to sex symbols to help boost our investment game.”

&gt; “I have a young daughter that everyday when I wake up wants to watch the recall trailer again. She knows who tracer is, and as she grows up, she can grow up alongside these characters. What I’m asking is that as you continue to add to the overwatch cast and investment elements, you double down on your commitment to create strong female characters. You’ve been doing a good job so far, but shipping with a tracer pose like this undermines so much of the good you’ve already done.”

1188,"To be fair, E3 2015 was really lame in terms of what games we actually got from it. Keep in mind this is all in hindsight.

* Most of Nintendo's showings were mediocre, ports, or unreleased.  Star Fox Zero, Mario &amp; Luigi, and Triforce Heroes all come to mind here.  Hyrule Warriors Legends was good but like I said, it's a port.  I haven't played Yoshi's Wooly World but I've heard that's great.

* Sony basically cashed in on player nostalgia while also showing off games that still haven't come out yet.  Showing off The Last Guardian *again* even though it still isn't out yet.  Announcing Shemnue 3 and FF7 Remastered even though they are SO far out that they might not release for years.  imo the best new thing they showed last year was Horizon: Zero Dawn, and that still isn't out yet. In fact, the only exclusives I can think of that are actually available now are Firewatch and U4, and those had been known about for a while.

* If we only look at the Xbox exclusives, Microsoft only had sequels and unreleased new IPs.  I think the only problem I had was the Minecraft Hololens demo, but that's more me being a huge skeptic than actually having a basis for disliking it.  The conference really wasn't that notable to me.

* Bethesda's conference probably had the most positive reception and I definitely agree with the notion.  Fallout 4 had mixed reception on launch though, which is basically the worst thing I can say about it.

I can't remember if I watched the EA and Ubisoft press conferences last year because every year I end up not liking what they show and I don't really play their games anyway.

1195,"&gt; The problem is that I think content warnings either cross the line from informed decisions to spoilers

[There are studies that suggest](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/17/spoilers-enhance-enjoyment-psychologists) spoilers actually enhance the enjoyment of media. I know people who rabidly research spoilers for Game of Thrones between seasons.  I don't think this is a serious concern but I figured I'd throw it out there that ""spoilers"" aren't inherently bad things.

&gt; or categorize works of art in such a way as to inevitably incentivize a degree of artistic compromise (see, studios refusing to fund film that are not PG13)

Stakeholders should not be obligated to fund a movie they don't want to.  If the artist really cares that much about their artistic vision they wouldn't seek funding from those who want to limit it.  Would you find a company that refuses to fund animated movies to be just as in the wrong as one who refuses to fund movies that are not family-friendly?

&gt; Take freezing a detached finger. It may seem logical to putt it on ice, but its actually harmful. Imagine if, on boat moters there was a sign that said ""if you lose a limb, putt it on ice"". That would be bad.

""TW: Rape"" does not tell me how to act in the same way your example does.  If the sign said ""Warning: Fingers may be lost in this area,"" and I put my lost finger on ice, that's an action I made of my own volition, and not because I was somehow persuaded to (persuaded being used very loosely there).  Similarly, if I decide not to read an article or something because of the ""TW:Rape,"" that's a choice I made independently. A more apt comparison would be if the TW said ""Rape victims should not read this,"" but that doesn't happen.

&gt; But we know that thats bad, becaue we have empirical data. imagine though, if on boat moters there was a sign that aid ""If you lose a limb, store it in a bag of that stuff they use to preserve corpses untill it can be reatached"" Now, that may or may not be actually helpful (i mean, its a preservative right?) but without some empirical studies, I think you and I would agree its irresponsible to do that.

...But what's the alternative?  Am I just supposed to let my arm rot doing nothing while I bleed out, because I have no scientific evidence to suggest a better solution?  You're suggesting a dangerous line of action here.  Even if I can't scientifically prove it, it's not intuitive to think that corpse preservation material *wouldn't* save my arm.

So no, I don't agree.  If we have no evidence to suggest the action is harmful, but we have *some* reason to believe it could help, why wouldn't we?",2016-06-05 02:19:25+00:00,d3we5c2,7.0,t1_d3wd4xl,1856.0,changemyview

1234,"Well, separate from the actual storyline, Osha is more recognizable than a Rickon who is going through puberty for casual viewers, so having them side-by-side in the twist's reveal helps everyone see the importance of the scene. I still don't think this is needed to explain her presence, but it's a contributing factor.

&gt; But why was she there? Why was Rickon brought back into the story at all?

I feel like you're going to ask why *this* was needed as well, but here goes:

* Osha has been with Rickon throughout the entirety of Seasons 4 and 5.  Of course we can't say that with certainty but we were never given a reason not to believe it.

* The Umbers have any number of motivations from bringing them to Ramsay that we haven't discovered yet, all of which have been extensively discussed on this sub.  We shouldn't dismiss the event as poor writing until we *know* its pointless.

* Ramsay needed a reason to send the pink letter to Jon.  The motives in the book don't align with the present situation.

* And I mean, come on, you're suggesting they shouldn't have brought back a *Stark*?

&gt; Why does any of that matter to begin with enough to justify immediately killing off Osha the second she's brought back?

I already explained the plot significance, but characters don't die offscreen in the show -- Especially not characters with three seasons worth of screen time.  It's the exact same scenario as Doran, Trystane, and Balon's deaths this season, but Osha was more prominent than all of them combined.  It's a disservice to the fanbase to just write her out of the show.

I quit League mid season 3 in favor of DOTA's more open-ended team building style, so this complaint is very interesting to me.

To expand on the whole bird thing, it's just part of his character.  In the story of Overwatch, Bastion is essentially designed to be a killing machine for the world's great war, but he was severely damaged towards the end of the war.  He reactivates 10 years later and most of his combat programming was lost, so he exhibits a more peaceful demeanor than he is supposed to.  The bird is symbolism for that.

1378,"[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRIHkiNz1hg) is a tournament meta analysis from the final week of Closed beta, which was about two weeks before Open Beta.  You'll notice that Bastion and Mei are towards the bottom on the tier list, ranking #16 and #20 respectively, even though they are by far the two most voted for nerfs.

What I noticed in Open Beta (which I did not notice during the closed beta Stress Tests I participated in) was that players *rarely* switched heroes.  This meant that, if your team wasn't already equipped to counter a Bastion, it was essentially a loss (caveat for KOTH maps because Bastion is just bad on most of the points). Bastion is easily countered by a *lot* of heroes. You can use Widowmaker, Hanzo, Mei, Tracer, Junkrat, Roadhog, and arguably Zarya to combat him.

As for Mei... idk, I played her more than anyone and even though I don't understand why she's so underplayed in competitive, I do acknowledge her weaknesses.  No escape method, the wall is somewhat useless depending on where you are on the map, and her ult just doesn't cut it in uncoordinated teams.  Most of the offensive heroes beat her in duels and can escape if needed, and the tanks won't die to her freeze+headshot combo.  McCree does the exact same thing with flashbang + unload, but much faster with much better consistency. Interestingly, any nerf to Mei would also be an indirect buff to Bastion, because Mei's wall is a good defensive counter to Sentry Mode.

Overall I hope Blizzard doesn't nerf based on the open beta data.  It just isn't necessary imo.",2016-05-23 04:07:03+00:00,d3g0596,1.0,t3_4klvhl,4952.0,Games

1417,"&gt; its easier to make plans with her friends who live close to her rather than make plans with me when she has to commit to the drive. Now the girl she hung out with today lives farther than me, but she also is one of her best friends so I can get why she'd make the commitment for that. 

You just invented an excuse to get her out of having done anything wrong.  She didn't tell you that her friend takes precedence over you, she told you that proximity takes precedence. And she's obviously lying about it.

&gt; Anyways, I told her that I am okay with coming to her, she doesnt have to do the whole drive to me thing all the time

The problem wasn't her not coming to visit you, it was her not being sincere about her not *wanting* to visit you.  All you've done with this solution is submit to the crappy way she's been treating you.

&gt; and I told her sorry if I sounded angry

Why are you apologizing? What did you do wrong? You just want to hang out with your girlfriend and she's making it impossible.

&gt; Andddd now im pretty sure shes pissed at me or doesnt want to talk to me cause shes ignoring me. I just feel like I made things worse now at this point. Idk, I just am afraid of pushing her away by being upset about something but taking it too far when it doesnt need to be, etc...

Okay, I see two possibilities here:

1. She was never that invested in your relationship, was probably ghosting you and is now ignoring you because she just wants you to go away.

2. She's manipulating you into putting up with all of her shit. If you're annoyed by this situation, trust me, it will only get worse from here on out.

Either way, she's not a good person based on your side of the story. At this point I think you're best off breaking things off.  There are so many other girls at your college that you haven't met yet, and many more that will come in when the fall semester starts.  Plus, you've only been dating for a month and a half.  Having this sort of problem so early on (imo) is showing that your relationship is basically doomed.

1569,"&gt; That's... not in the comic, that's in the title text. And I actually don't disagree with it. Free speech isn't an argument, it's a defense for your ability to express your argument.

Well that's what I was referring to when I said ""I quote that text so much.""  Sorry if that wasn't clear before.

&gt; No, but neither should you have the ability to take away that platform if it was provided by somebody else. That would deny me my freedom of expression.

I'm confused where this is coming from, because I said nothing of the sort.  *Having said that*, I (and everyone else) am completely in the right to protest speech I disagree with.  I can ask/demand Twitch to crack down on racist behavior in their streams' chats if I want to.  That doesn't deny anyone the ability to say their racist statements if Twitch decides to crack down on it.  If they did do this, you can't say I was the one who denied your ability to do it on Twitch, because Twitch is the one who made the decision.

&gt; it implies that if the listener deems someone's speech to not have any value, they can deny them the ability to express it without infringing on their right to free speech.

Which they have every right to.  I don't get why the right to speak freely goes above a person's human right to remove negative elements from their surroundings.

I personally never understood the need for single player content in fighting games but I totally get why people are turned off by the lack of it.  Mortal Kombat 9 and 10 both had very extensive single player content while also having more characters than SFV currently has. I can't even defend the game by saying that they've been totally honest and upfront about the fact that they're releasing more single player content post-launch, because Guilty Gear -Revelator- has a business plan where the game's local multiplayer is currently fully functional and playable for anyone who has pre-ordered the game (minus some of the new characters I think), but the official launch will come with all of the single player content.  Why couldn't Capcom have done this? If it wasn't for the niche nature of anime fighting games, and the raw brand power SF has, GG would be walking all over SF in the FGC right now.

1634,"[Here's the TempoStorm Meta Snapshot](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/meta-snapshot-1-the-new-standard) I used.  It's the most recent one that was posted a few hours ago.

What I did was counted every card in each deck and added it to the point total for its set: For every Abusive Sergeant, for example, I added one point to the Classic set.  I figured that it was better overall to count duplicates, as it shows what sets a given archetype or class relies on the most. EDIT: I only counted each card per deck once, but seeing the card in a different deck added a point.

As you can probably imagine, most classes rely on their basic set a lot.  The key exception to that was Shaman, which used a lot more TGT cards than other classes did.  The only basic neutral cards that I saw were Wolfrider and Acidic Swamp Ooze, in fact.

As you can see, and probably expected, TGT was the least represented based on how much of the card pool it takes up.  While it makes up 18.3% of all standard cards, it only sees a 6.8% share of cards used in the snapshot.  In other words: #TGTCardsMatter.

* Absolutely zero communication in the majority of my matches.  A lot of people won't even emote pre-match.
* People just won't change their character.  This varies depending on how niche their initial pick was (like Symmetra or something).
* Getting both a support and a tank seems to be way more difficult than it should be.  I've been in multiple games lately where I'll pick a tank and realize we have no supports, but if I were to switch we'd be missing a tank.
* People are a lot more inclined to complain about the enemy Bastion (both in and out of game) rather than repick to counter it. Like honestly 76, you could switch to Genji and fill the exact same role you currently are, while ALSO destroying the Basion whose spamming stationary mode.
* None of the composition complaints mentioned above will stop teams from having both a Widow and a Hanzo though.  I actually played a match yesterday where we were attacking Gibraltar and my team picked Widow and two Hanzos... Thankfully one of the Hanzos switched to Mei after I requested it, and she ended up destroying the enemy team and got POTG at one point.

This means that the Naxxramas and Goblins vs Gnomes expansions will not be playable in standard.  The format is going to be the official format for the Hearthstone Championship Tournament series. The format rotates after the first set release every year (starting with this expansion).

Some of them are worse than others actually, like Sylvanas requiring you to trigger it with your own mana (because Master of Disguise can't kill it).  That is dependent on the class though.  Equality/Sylvanas would be good.

1964,"&gt; I'm not sure you realize exactly what running legacy servers would entail. For one thing, Vanilla has a separate codebase for the most part from the game as it stands now. It wouldn't just be a separate server, it would have to be an entirely separate server infrastructure with blades designed around the old game code base.

Nostalrius seemed to do it just fine without any external funding.  In fact, many private servers do as well.  You're telling me Blizzard can't, with how many millions of dollars they earn every year?

&gt; Do users on these old legacy servers have the ability to communicate with users on modern servers? Because the chat system has changed by now. So the old servers would have to have code changed so that ""Vanilla WoW"" can use modern battle.net chat systems.

Diablo 2 and Warcraft 3 were both recently updated.  Whether or not they decide to implement Bnet chat in the game is entirely their decision, but they've shown that they can update classic games with ease.

&gt; What about bugs? Are they going to fix bugs that show up on legacy servers? If so they'd have to have a separate Q+A system between them with a separate ticketing system, to keep things organized. Would they have to have separate bug testers entirely? How about CMs that know how to deal with vanilla issues vs issues on modern servers?

Nostalrius devs and GMs did just fine in this aspect.  And again, they did this without a paycheck.

&gt; Then there's the whole thing where servers cost money to run, and Blizzard uses a business model that works on an economy of scale. They are able to get tons of server blades because they are all identical, running game servers that use the same codebase. A legacy server is going to be much less cost efficient. Will enough people want to use it to make up that difference? If there are too many people, the server won't be able to handle it and they'd need to start having multiple legacy server blades. Now we're talking about maintaining two entirely separate versions of the game - but people would still be paying a single subscription?

Did you see how many thousands of people were playing Nostalrius when it was shut down? The server had 800k unique accounts signed up to play and there's a [petition with almost 100k signatures](https://www.change.org/p/mike-morhaime-legacy-server-among-world-of-warcraft-community?recruiter=522873458) asking Blizzard to allow the server to live on.

And why would Blizzard use a single sub fee for both versions when they could easily monetize the two separately? Or maybe a package deal where you get a discount for being subbed to both.

&gt; Honestly, it just doesn't make good business sense, especially when we live in a gaming environment now where MMOs are on their way out, not the new hotness.

The numbers just don't agree with you there.  There are still several million subs to the current WoW, on top of the almost 1 million people who registered for Nolstarius.  You don't need a gigantic community to support a game.

2002,"&gt; Why? Are you implying that only women can get raped? I sure hope you're not doing that.

Strawman. He said nothing to imply that and nobody actually thinks that. But that doesn't mean that men are as equally affected by Rape as women are, and it's equally as foolish to say that men can't be raped as it is to say that.

But while we're talking about the use of the word 'Rape', when was the last time you saw someone seriously make comments about Raping a male streamer, or just a man in general? Like, where 'rape' wasn't used as a passive filler verb like 'wrecked' or 'destroyed' would be.

&gt; But if you aren't doing that, then why are you singling out ""rape""? There are many other violent acts such as ""kill"" which are also part of gaming vocabulary.

We've had extensive conversations on /r/ChangeMyView about the difference between ""rape"" and ""kill"" when used in non-literal ways, and why it's okay to say Kill but not Rape. You should go read those.  Within the gaming community, killing is an extremely common form of interaction between players or interaction between player and NPC.  It's also accepted as a consequence of violence which is (obviously) very prevalent in gaming.  Rape is not.  Rape only exists within the gaming community because people say things like ""yeah we totally raped them,"" etc.  It's a word that's entirely out of place within the community because there's no reason to use that word over another one, while *also* being a serious thing that many people have to suffer through and endure.",2016-04-11 22:49:39+00:00,d1z2rw7,15.0,t1_d1z14ba,2509.0,changemyview

2006,"&gt; If she has nudes circulating on the internet and then gets triggered about everything, what does she expect is going to happen on twitch.tv?

You completely dodged the point here.

&gt; So Mira doesn't dress provocatively just to get views?

I don't see how making weird sexual comments every time you see her, especially en masse with the rest of Twitch, is justified because of this.

&gt; What about Eloise? Why do people treat her respectfully? Weird huh?

Well, first of all, Eloise doesn't stream nearly as much and her presence in the community is rather small compared to most others.  Not that me saying that disproves your point, but it's worth noting that bigger personalities (read: Hafu) get scrutinized more.

Again, the way Mira dresses is not an excuse to say the things I talked about. And this point certainly doesn't counter the fact that *no* male viewer receives creepy sexual comments regardless of how they act on stream.  And despite your points about Hafu, whose only claim to sexualization you can name is that one time her nudes got leaked on the internet, she otherwise has no sexualization in her online persona or on her stream whatsoever.

2007,"[Yes, the ones beside Kaceytron,](http://www.pcgamer.com/hearthstone-pro-hafu-speaks-out-about-sexist-trolling-on-twitch/). 
In the video, Hafu talks about how (while she was a top competitor in WoW PvP) she competed in a regional tournament where one of the teams was literally named ""GonnaRapeHafu."" Here's a quote from the article.

&gt; A number of commenters in the related Reddit thread claim that [Hafu's] not being harassed because she's female, but simply because she's a streamer, and putting up with abuse is just part of the job. But the nature of the comments are telling: Trash-talking bad play is an integral part of the sports-watching experience, but hurling threats of sexual violence or abuse at a player's gender or appearance? Do the male pros get abuse related to being men? Very much not.

Further, I was watching a Hearthstone event this weekend where Mira was invited, and the moment she showed up on stream with Trump everyone started posting about how she needs to threesome with the other guy in the room, among other sexual comments.  Keep in mind this was completely uninvited by Mira.

Besides, those same kids watching Twitch don't make the same sexual comments about male streamers, so I don't see your point.  To be honest, the fact that you have to keep making excuses for blatently sexist behavior kinda proves your point wrong.

I think the best synergy this card has is obviously Siphon Soul: Pay 7 mana and 3 life to destroy a minion and summon a 7/7.

2045,"My philosophy is that any spoiler is okay *as long* as the person you're spoiling it for either specifically requested the spoiler or is okay with being spoiled. On /r/Gameofthrones, if I click a thread marked [No Spoilers] and someone spoils something, that's not okay.  If I click a thread marked [ADWD] and I find out something I didn't want to know, it's my fault for clicking the thread.

&gt; If someone blatantly spoils what happens to, say, Star Wars movies before the sequel trilogy, do you consider that wrong? These are all decade old movies that are ""giants"", so to speak, in popular culture.

I'm assuming you're talking about the prequels right? Not that it really matters but I want us to be on the same page.

Anyhow, spoilers always depend on context.  Does the person you're spoiling want to know this information? Then no. Do they want to experience the movies for themselves? Then yes. Is the person just randomly shouting spoilers in a busy walkway? Absolutely yes.

Of course these spoilers have more than likely been spoiled for a lot of people, along with many other twists in other media (certain deaths in FF7 for example).  That's just the nature of older media giants.  Eventually, *everyone* is going to know what happened regardless of whether they've experienced it themselves (though I still don't like it). As you said, Warcraft 1 is not among these giants. I would argue that not even Warcraft 3 is.

&gt; Fact of the matter is that this information is very much available within the MMO itself. Like, the Yogg-Saron fight in Ulduar contains a pretty ""massive"" spoiler about the film. WoD itself basically spoils the entire premise to the movie, and Thrall himself is a living spoiler.

See, I've fought Yogg-Saron, and I played WoD (I obviously know who Thrall and Garona are).  I still have *no clue* what the plot of the movie is beyond what the trailers have shown.  I certainly could go and look everything up, even within the game, but that would be spoiling the movie for myself, and I didn't want to do that. It'd be different if I had this knowledge before the movie came out, but I didn't.  I'd still put the spoiler I initially pointed out in spoiler tags though.

&gt; I don't think people should spoiler tag information that, not only has been available for over twenty years, but that is also widely available within the actual video game that the subreddit is devoted too.

Which comes back to my Game of Thrones example.  Is it okay to spoil everything for a Game of Thrones watcher because the books were released upwards of 20 years ago? Absolutely not, and that's exactly why both /r/GameofThrones and /r/asoiaf have *very* extensive spoiler rules.

Further, another issue is that playing WoW does not require knowledge of the events of Warcraft 1, or even playing the content that reveals what happened ruing that game. It's not a linear experience.  You can have a very full, healthy experience with the game without ever touching that stuff (or at least, without understanding contextually that it's WC1 lore).  If they made a feature-length movie about Lilian Voss, I'm not going to go around spoiling that she dies in Scholomance just because you *can* play that dungeon while leveling.",2016-04-07 21:54:47+00:00,d1u4vop,9.0,t1_d1u3vtj,1351.0,wow

There's a difference between a patch and DLC, but the March Update's entire purpose is to implement the store.  Even if we remove all of the actual DLC content (Alex, costumes, etc) and only have the balance updates and store implementation, there are *still* products that need to be offered via Steam and PSN in the form of Zenny.

As long as these things are core to the patch, it won't release until a PSN store update.  The alternative would be to have a clickable store button on the main menu that leads to ""There's nothing to purchase yet,"" which might as well not even be a patch at all.

You also still receive all of the benefits though.  You just don't get to do union activities like union elections. 

Source: http://www.nrtw.org/a/a_1_p.htm ""If you are not a member, you are still fully covered by the collective bargaining agreement that was negotiated between your employer and the union, and the union is obligated to represent you. Any benefits that are provided to you by your employer pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement (e.g., wages, seniority, vacations, pensions, health insurance)are not affected by your nonmembership.""

&gt; You have the requirement to be represented by the union.

You say this like it's a bad thing.  The union's entire purpose is to defend its members.

&gt; A true right to organize would mean you could have multiple unions with the right to be represented by whoever you want, or no one at all if you so preferred.

[What is the bigger number: Five, or One?](https://youtu.be/lI0cRfHCfzk?t=35) Excuse the Game of Thrones link but I just don't understand how you think having multiple unions competing against each other helps employees at all.

The problem with Fates (and Awakening to a slightly lesser extent) is that every male unit in your army can achieve supports with every female in your army.  So instead of a unit having ~3-6 support pairings, they have upwards of 20.  The result is far less interesting dialogues between characters.

At least I know what to expect for the remaining chapters. Gameplay wise, the only thing I didn't like about this campaign is that there's no save between the final battle and the battle before it.  Whoever thought that was a good idea is a moron.

I agree that the characters in Fates (in general) are a bit worse than in Awakening, but there are about twice as many, so it makes sense that they are a bit more one-dimensional.

2535,"&gt; But it's really discouraging playing ranked, getting up to about 18 with my pretty-good-but-very-very-cheap Hunter and Shaman decks, and getting absolutely annihilated by decks with 5 or 6 legendaries and a dozen rares and epics.

There's a ranking squish at the beginning of every season and it's one of the sources of the problems you're having.  When the season resets, you get one star for every rank you reached, so at rank 18 you're competing against people who were rank 6 at the end of last season, for example.  It's an absolutely horrendous system.

Since you're playing Shaman, I'm assuming you know about Aggro/Face Shaman.  It's an extremely strong deck and, even though it's quite difficult to play, you'll find a lot of success by using it.  Craft yourself a couple of Doomhammers and get Lava Shock from the Blackrock Mountian adventure and you'll be set.

As /u/yuristocrat said, the new format might do good to resolve some of the issues with the current meta decks.  The sets that are being phased out are infamous for having the strongest cards, so come April the meta is going to be in such chaos that you'll find yourself enjoying it a lot more.",2016-03-07 06:38:54+00:00,d0qiar1,2.0,t1_d0p84su,97721.0,Games

2537,"You mentioned you've played TWD and TWAU so I'll throw **Tales From the Borderlands** onto that.  I think it's really solid though inferior to both TWD and TWAU.

There's also **Her Story**, which, through the use of several hours of recorded video, tells the tale of a woman whose husband was murder in the 90s.  There are a couple hundred video clips that require you to discover them by searching keywords in the game's database, which results in a very interesting non-linear mystery story. 

**Transistor** is an tactical action RPG that follows a woman whose voice was stolen by the government. Most of the game is narrated by her weapon, the Transistor, but there's also a lot of narrative by world building. It's only about ~4 hours long but has some of the best storytelling I've ever seen in a video game, and it's one of my top games of all time.

**Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc** is a japanese visual novel that follows 16 high school students who are trapped in their academy, and are forced to kill each other in order to escape. It's really heavy on the anime tropes but I think it's a great game nonetheless.

The rest of my recommendations are text-heavy (if they even have voice acting at all) so if you struggle with reading I unfortunately don't think they'll be for you, but I still recommend checking them out.

**To The Moon** is an indie adventure game where two scientists enter a dying man's memories in order to make him believe he landed on the moon in his lifetime. It's a very wonderful and tragic story that is told in reverse-chronological order, and its sequel should be coming out by the end of this year.

**Undertale** is an RPG in the vein of Earthbound that follows a young child's journey through a land of monsters. It's relies heavily on subverting standard video game narrative tropes, and encourages you not to actually kill any of the monsters you encounter.  This one is hit or miss for a lot of people though.  Some people absolutely loved it but others didn't like it at all.  Still, the [soundtrack is killer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGaneyDfyls) and is almost worth the price of admission by itself.

2556,"So I found that Awakening was a really mediocre FE game after I got over the extremely interesting new mechanics like pairing up and eugenics. I consider the child system in Awakening to be different enough from FE4 that, to me, they're pretty much two different mechanics.

Mechanically, Fates is one of the best in the franchise.  It took everything that Awakening wanted to do and actually made it fun and not broken. Pairing up doesn't trivialize the game anymore, and reclassing doesn't produce OP units either. They also effectively doubled the amount of classes and skills, and also made it possible to reclass units based on the options of their S/A+ rank supports, so there's a LOT of variety in that sense.

In terms of plot, I don't think there's anything special about it.  It REALLY likes to remind you about the fact that you choose your alignment right at the beginning of the game.  Corrin REALLY likes to regret the fact that he chose Nohr over Hoshido whenever anyone from Hoshido comes into the story, for example. I also find Corrin to be far less interesting than Robin was, but the flip side is that (at least in Conquest) the main supporting characters are far more interesting. I'm over halfway into Conquest and while the fantasy elements are obviously there, it isn't the focus of the story. I wouldn't be surprised if it ended without having to kill a giant dragon who is going to end the world, for example, but I'm sure that will be the case in Revelations.

Also, just in general, Conquest is *significantly* harder than Awakening.  The little I've played of Birthright seems to suggest it's harder than Awakening as well, but Conquest is supposed to be the hardest of the three in a ohmygodimbashingmyheadagainstthewall sort of way.",2016-03-05 22:49:20+00:00,d0oyyxk,3.0,t1_d0ouzmi,7185.0,Games

2562,"There's a tl;dr below this, but I want you to read as much of it as you can to understand where I'm coming from.

As a general note, there's very little in the world of gaming that deserves the hatred it gets.  For example, there was pretty significant backlash recently against a formerly Xbox One exclusive title now being released on PC as well.  You probably didn't see a whole lot of it because the Reddit hivemind is generally against the Xbox and in favor of PC getting...well, anything.  On that note, you can't base your thoughts on what's happening in the world solely on what Reddit users have been posting about it.  I've seen a pretty significant number of Redditors bashing Fire Emblem Fates because of it's pricing model but I (and several other FE fans for that matter) are perfectly fine with it.

Now, from here on I might come off as sounding mean and rude, and for that I apologize. To say it succinctly, I am one of the people who are very, very upset with the new Metroid. So on that note...

&gt; do you still think the hate for Metroid Prime is unjustifiable?

I'm assuming you meant ""justifiable,"" to which I answer: Absolutely.

To be honest, the way you defended your view makes it come off as though I, as a Metroid fan, should be happy I'm getting anything at all.  I say this because of the following statements (I'll combine them all into one quote and separate with ellipses):

&gt; Don't you want some updates to the Metroid universe? Don't you want more story plots? Don't you want more lore? Don't you want to know the back story to the interactions between Samus and Sylux? ... It is worth noting is that the producer wasn't allowed to put a Metroid Prime title on the Wii U ... What will the Metroid fans do in the meantime, if there are no Metroid-universe game made for the current generation (before NX)? The producer doesn't want to let the fans wait, so I am sure Kensuke Tanabe would like to do something about this.

The general theme in these statements, to me, is ""you could have had nothing.""  Therefore, your expanded view is ""it's better to have something in your fandom, even though it barely resembles it in the first place, as long as it means you got something.""

From my perspective, there are two sorts of Metroid fans: The Prime fans (those who started on Metroid Prime, and perhaps don't even like the 2D metroids) and the OG fans (those who started with Metroid 1 or Super Metroid, and possibly don't like the Prime games).  I happen to enjoy all Metroid games - except for Other M, which was also panned by most of the community.  So let's look at release windows for these fanbases:

* If you are an OG fan, the last game you got was Metroid Zero Mission, a **remake** of the first game in the franchise, which came out in 2004.  The game is certainly quality and, imo, stands as the official ""last"" 2D metroid release, but if we only consider original entries, the last 2D Metroid was Metroid Fusion, which was released in 2002.
* If you're a Prime fan, the last game you got was Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. That was released in 2007.  Now, keep in mind that almost everyone in the fandom considers this the weakest of the three Primes, but I'm not about to dismiss it's relevance because of that.
* If, for whatever reason, you found Other M to be a worthy entry in the franchise, THAT would be considered your most recent game, having been released in 2010.

So, at a minimum, a Metroid fan hasn't had a new entry in the series for nearly six years (Other M released in the states in August), but I need to emphasize the fact that most of the fandom did not like Other M. Before you move on, would you also apply your reasoning that we should be happy, as a fandom, that we got something we didn't like?

So let's ignore Other M for a second. I, as a Prime fan, haven't had a new game in almost **ten years**. Keep in mind in this ten years there has only been a single game in the franchise - one that very few people, including myself, enjoyed.  Someone who's been waiting for another 2D entry in the franchise has been waiting for **12-14 years** depending on where we draw the line.  

In that twelve year span, we've seen 9 Super Mario Bros, 6 Legends of Zelda, 9 Kirbys, 2 Pikmins, 5 Fire Emblems (6 if you count the incredible remake of FE3 that was never released in the states), 5 main-series Pokemons  (counting remakes but not ""enhanced editions"" like Emerald and Platinum), 4 Mario Karts, 7 Mario Parties, 3 Star Foxes, 2 Donkey Kongs, and a decent number of new IPs (the most notable of which being Splatoon).

Imagine if you're a Zelda fan and you didn't get a single one of those Zelda titles (which include both 2D and 3D games to varying degrees of, but mostly positive, quality), and you've been waiting since Wind Waker to get anything from your favorite dungeon crawling, adventure seeking, item gathering franchise from your childhood.  You hear nothing for *years* until finally, in 2014, Nintendo announces... [Hyrule Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrule_Warriors):  A literal Zelda reskin of Dynasty Warriors. Hell, even despite all of the Zelda titles up to this point, Hyrule Warrios was *still* met with heavy skepticism.  But the more important lesson here is this: Even though the game is really good and quite fun in it's own right, it is by no means a Zelda game. If I was trying to recommend the game to someone, I would recommend it to people who are fans of action games before I would ever recommend it to a Zelda fan.

Now, yes, you provided all of the facts regarding why we didn't get Metroid titles.  But why does any of that matter?  All it says to me is that Nintendo didn't really care about the fanbase in the first place, and if anything, the existence of this game says two things: One, that they have no idea what Metroid fans want, and Two, that they think they could get away with releasing a game that is only Metroid in name.  If I were any more cynical I would call it a cash grab.

I just posted a MASSIVE wall of text, and for that I apologize.  As I'm sure you can see, I'm a little upset about this.

**tl;dr** Reddit isn't a good representation of whether there is actually concerns within the fanbase. Even then, Metroid fans have had to wait for 10-14 years for a new entry, and only have a mediocre game and a spinoff to show for it.  All of this is topped off by the fact that almost every other IP under Nintendo's wing has had regular entries throughout that time frame, not even counting the spinoffs of those same franchises.

2588,"&gt; Only if there is exactly one gameplay mechanic for killing everything in those games ... Which is so embarrassingly simple and poorly designed that it's not even worth commenting on ... Push ""x"" over every option except ""attack"" in the menu bar until you win. Repeat 50000 times. 

To be fair, a *lot* of critically-acclaimed games can be reduced to such a degree that they seem boring, poorly-designed, and not worth your time.  ""Press X and Y happens"" is a complete oversimplification of any game, but for a game that relies so heavily on how the narrative ties into everything you do, it's also missing the point. The game is so much more than its combat.

For example, I can reduce **To The Moon** into ""enter a dream, collect a few things, move on,"" but that completely misses the point.

&gt; Toriel is the most ""complicated"" enemy in the game

In terms of pacifist play that isn't true.  Undyne is a much more complicated fight if you don't know how to pacify her going in. The black knights are the same way because there's multiple ways to initiate the pacifist path.

You're free to dislike the game, and I don't want to sound like I'm blinding defending the game from it's obvious shortcomings like /u/litehound is, but there's much more to Undertale than you're letting on.

EDIT: Some developers focus on their gameplay gimmick and add the story later (**There Came An Echo** comes to mind here), but I think Toby Fox focused on his narrative first, and tied the gameplay into it later.

You said 27 chapters in so I'm assuming you're talking about ""Cog of Destiny,"" which is the chapter you recruit Vaida and the boss is either Lloyd of Linus. This is arguably one of the hardest chapters in the game, actually.

[I found a video](https://youtu.be/SZSVw4BbHWA?t=3856) of the second wave of reinforcements arriving on Eliwood Hard Mode, and they definitely don't show up until the end of the enemy turn. If I remember correctly EHM is only available after you've beaten the game once, and they certainly wouldn't be start-of-turn in Eliwood Normal if they were end-of-turn in Eliwood Hard.

&gt; My brother also played the GameCube Fire Emblem game as his introduction to the series, and he came away with the same complaint.

I've played Path of Radiance several times and that definitely is not the case.  Having to restart still feels *terrible* in that one though, because you can't turn off animations in your first playthrough. I can't recommend it to people unless they're playing it using Dolphin.

&gt; I know that, but it was because I felt like I was robbed of that character that made me not want to restart the chapter, just because the game decided to place those characters at that arbitrary location after I killed the last unit on the map.

I'm curious which chapter you're talking about then, because Cog of Destiny is a rout chapter (which ends after killing every unit on the map), and it's just really unlikely that you would lose on the last turn of a seize chapter because of reinforcements.

&gt; I just want a turn-based tactics game that feels fair in that regard.

Not much to say other than that I'm having a blast.  I've spent 17 hours in the game so far and most of it has been training mode and matchmaking.

**Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest**

Classic/Hard Mode.  Holy shit this game is hard.  Probably the hardest of the American Fire Emblems in my opinion.  Still, that doesn't mean I'm not enjoying it.  Mechanically, Awakening is one of my least favorite in the series, so I'm glad that Fates is an improvement on every front.  Still, there are some things that kinda drive me crazy, like an enemy unit that has a rod that will **cut your maximum HP in half for the remainder of the battle**, and not being able to kill him first without being swarmed by all the enemy monks in the room.

2767,"&gt; dark cultist

Priest runs three superior 3-drops depending on the deck: Blackrock Technician, Blademaster and Deathlord.  They are all neutral. Dark Cultist is a mediocre card.

&gt; Paletress

Most Control decks don't run this.  They would rather run Ysera for a turn 9 play.

&gt; Naaru

Mediocre card that doesn't see play outside of burst decks.  You'd never run this in Control Priest or Dragon Priest.

&gt; Blademaster

Neutral

&gt; Holy Champion

Too easily removed, too easily played around, and Priest has no way to protect it.  I tried very hard to get this card to work and it just doesn't.  I run Elise in my Control Priest and Twilight Guardian in my Dragon Priest.

&gt; Strong hero power

* The Geth are pacified, either through eradication, retribution, or peaceful resolution.

2777,"The setups for fighting game tournaments are vastly different than they are for MOBAs and other eSports. Most eSport tournaments start online then move to LAN (or are just always LAN) and tend not to have a lot of matches going at once.

Meanwhile with fighting game majors you're playing dozens of matches at a time for 12+ hours a day. It's so much easier for a TO to get, say, 20 ps4s that will actually work for the entire needed time, than find 20 PCs that all run the game at the same quality and also withstand 12+ hours of gaming in a hot, low ventilation room.

Not to mention the amount of money it takes to run the other eSports is significantly higher than the FGC. The FGC (minus CPT since that's Capcom-ran) is grassroots and most majors can't afford to have something like all high-end PCs for the one game they can use it on. They will cut corners when they can, and its much easier to use the console that can play SF5, MKXL, and GGXrd:R as opposed to the PC which only has one of them.",2016-02-16 08:29:15+00:00,d01pm3r,7.0,t1_d01e3ox,23558.0,Games

2818,"&gt; that could have been shown in a brief cutscene

The only time in the game you see the appearance of Julia is in the photo...which obscures her face. There's a reason for this. There's a reason you never see Delilah.  There's a reason Ned's face is obscured by his flashlight, or the teenagers are obscured by distance. You're supposed to fill in those details with your imagination. Even if the cutscene never showed Julia's face (which would DEFINITELY call attention to the hiding of details), having a cutscene at the beginning would break the illusion.  The details you pick are supposed to immerse you in Henry's life.  To make the shame of your failing marriage so much more important when Delilah confronts you about it later.  Otherwise it's just another character that doesn't mean anything to the player.

&gt;or revealed subtly throughout the game.

Except it really couldn't have.  The reason they did that was to give you an immediate attachment to Henry.  Your conversations with Delilah hinge on having the complete story from the get go.  It's immersion breaking to get a flashback to your marriage every time Delilah asks you something.

So I was 18 about to enter my senior year of high school when Toy Sorry 3 came out. I *loved* those movies as a kid so I went to the theatre with my friend to watch it. At the end of the movie, Andy gives all of his toys to a young neighbor girl, before diving off to college.

I left the theater an emotional wreck. I have had emotional reactions to other media before but I was in a state similar to you and hadn't experienced that level of emotion from any media. My friend couldn't really understand why. Well here's why: the entire final scene showed what my life was to become a year from then: my childhood was going to end, and that I had to move on from the things I cherished as a kid. Even now thinking about it I tear up. No one ever really gets it when I explain it to them either.

Moving on to Firewatch, you may be missing the forest in the trees. Yes, what happened to Julia was sad, and the stories you uncover about Ned and Brian Goodwin are sad as well, but the genius of the game is what it tried to convey. It's a reminder that you can't escape life. Henry and Delilah both joined the watch to escape their problems and enjoy an isolated life free from the baggage their normal life brings. But at the end of the summer, despite his wishes, Henry had to go back to the reality of his wife's condition, and his lack of friends. This is what Delilah reminds him about in the ending, if you recall.

Maybe, whether or not you realized it, but the game may have evoked these feelings in you about something in your real life. The feeling that you want to escape but ultimately can't. That's entirely okay, and honestly anyone who is serious about playing narrative-driven games should understand the feelings you're having.

You realize that rioting is not protesting right? The rioting that happened in Ferguson was decried by people who actually do BLM protesting.

Not illegal. Disrespectful, yes.  Not illegal.

&gt; disturbing the peace

""Disturbing the peace, also known as breach of the peace, is a criminal offense that occurs when a person engages in some form of disorderly conduct, such as fighting or threatening to fight in public, causing excessively loud noise, by shouting, playing loud music, or even allowing a dog to bark for prolonged periods ...""

Rioting is not protesting. Protesting is protected by the first amendment and is immune from the ""excessively loud noise, etc"" portion of that.

If you haven't seen a big-budget game without voice acting, it's because the industry deems it vital to the quality of their product.

3053,"&gt; So if they agree on 50k, a second scale is just a second payment of 50k.

I'm genuinely curious what voice actors exist in the video game industry that are getting paid $50k for a game. That number seems horribly outlandish to just throw out.

&gt; On to my view which can be summed up as the following. Video Game voice actors do not have a leg to stand on. In comparison to other mediums, video game voice actors do not add the same relative value to the product in question. For decades, stemming from the advent of video games, and still regularly today, video games have gone on to be 100% complete without spoken roles. While more recent games (think Metal Gear Solid on the PS1 recent) have featured vocal talent, that vocal talent is not nearly as essential to the experience as talent is with American animation and Anime.

3061,"&gt; 1: Has there been any word on why Bran was not in season 5

I'm not entirely sure, but there are a few theories.  One is that they had wrapped up everything from Bran's storyline in the books.  His book 5 content took place in the season where everyone's book 3 content was still rolling.  Sansa, Dany, and Theon also had book 4/5 content in Season 4, but they didn't delve too far into those stories (and in the case of Theon, most of his Book 5 content happens chronologically parallel to book 3 anyway). The other theory is that Bran's actor (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) was aging incredibly fast and it was starting to show more and more as the show went on.  By removing him for a season, they could make the age jump seem more realistic.

Honestly I think the break was a good thing, because Bran was already so far ahead of everyone else, and so far removed, that it would have been hard to tie him in to the events of Season 5.  Sansa and Arya (and in a way, Tyrion) both had their book content altered to tie them into the events that transpire with other characters, but it would have been much harder to do with Bran. 

&gt; 2: Why won't Dany release her dragons?

I'm not sure I follow.  Do you want her to release the dragons into the wild?  Dany still aims to use them as war machines at some point.

For what it's worth, [All Books](#b ""There exists a book-only character who inadvertently releases Viserion and Rhaegal in an attempt to befriend them.  This scene also causes his death, and is a huge plot point in ADWD."")

&gt; 3: Was there only ever two penises shown in the series (Hodor and walk of atonement), neither were necessary, why?

There was Theon's in S1E6 after he was done fucking Ros, and I think you see a little bit of Ramsay's and Jon's in their nude scenes. I don't think it's important to focus on the nudity, however.

&gt; 4:
 The battle is now between Lion, Serpent, Dragon, and Torture X?

A few points: the Martell family's sigil is the [Sunspear](https://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3a0tfUh3X1qcqqrqo1_500.png), and the Bolton sigil is the [Flayed Man](http://history-behind-game-of-thrones.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/House-Bolton-heraldry.jpg).  Also, no, none of those factions are currently at war with each other.  Dany's camp is currently in rescue mode and is still trying to stabilize Slaver's Bay (Meereen, etc.).  The Boltons just fought off Stannis's army.  The Lannisters are in all sorts of disarray given Cersei's imprisonment, Tyrion's exile, and the death of Myrcella.  King Tommen is still recognized as a Baratheon, as well. Jaime and Kevan Lannister (Tywin's brother) are pretty much the only Lannisters left in good standing and we aren't sure what Kevan is planning to do with Casterly Rock at the moment.

We also won't know what is going to happen with Dorne, because Myrcella's assassination wasn't sanctioned by Doran and who knows when that news will reach him. Based on his personality and his actions in Season 5, it's more likely he will have Ellaria Sand executed for her actions, but we'll see in two months.

&gt; 5: The Mountain is now a Frankenstein type guard?

Yes, and more importantly, he is shown to be Cersei's 'savior' of sorts.  He is going to be the champion in Cersei's forthcoming trial by combat.

&gt; 6: Only one giant was shown after the wall battle, his he the only one?

No

&gt; 7: I know i have to wait until April, are episodes bi weekly? because 10 episodes is pretty short, and in season 5 there were some ""previously on"" stuff.

They air weekly, so the season will end in early July.  They always skip Memorial weekend.

&gt; 8: I have seen some people talking about books, what are these books and do they expand past what we have seen?

As of season 5, the show has either caught up or surpassed the books.  The two exceptions are the Greyjoy storyline, which they will be covering in Season 6, and Samwell, whose storyline is currently right at the start of Book 4. As of right now, Stannis's storyline has surpassed the books, and some of the storylines have been completely changed.

Tyrion has surpassed the books in the sense that he has met Daenerys, whereas in the books he and Jorah hit a pretty significant roadblock on their path there. Sansa, Jaime, and Brienne are in situations far removed from their book counterparts.  The storyline in Dorne was completely rewritten, leaving out two of the book's most important characters from that storyline.  Barristan Selmy was also killed off when he is otherwise alive (and very much important) in the books. Myrcella is also alive in the books, unless you believe a certain fan theory.",2016-01-26 07:02:59+00:00,czcammg,1.0,t3_42q66o,4086.0,gameofthrones

[This one](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1011205) followed 2500 men and transgerdered women who have sex with men, and found that PrEP reduced their HIV infection rates by 44%.  The interesting statistic is that only 3 of the 34 hiv-infected subjects who were assigned the actual PrEP had the drug show up in their blood test at the end of the study, implying (in my opinion) that those who had become infected weren't using it properly.

Further, [Here](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/risk.html) is a list of HIV infection rates by sexual act.  Note this statement:

&gt; Using both condoms and antiretroviral therapy reduces the risk of HIV acquisition from sexual exposure by 99.2%.

Without any of the above requirements you're looking at a 1.38% chance of being infected each time you bottom with your poz boyfriend, based on the CDC website above.  Over 100 encounters that would be a 75% chance of infection.

Add the 99.2% infection reduction from condoms and his medication, and the 44% reduction from yours.  That puts you at **0.006%** chance of infection.  Over 100 bottoming sessions you're looking at, well, 0.006% again.  If you bottomed for your boyfriend every day for five years straight, you're looking at an 11% chance of being infected.

Keep in mind that's only if you exclusively bottom once a day for five years straight.  Any breaks you take in that time, or any times you top, will drastically lower that.  If you are the top in the relationship, you could have sex with him every day for ten years and still barely have the same infection rate that being an unprotected, non-medicated bottom once would give you.

I do think in the future you should be more careful about your adjective use when it isn't about the game.

I've always held the belief that fighting games are always the best spectator game (barring certain particle-heavy games like Blazblue) because you see everything that's going on at all times.  You aren't having to deal with camera swapping in FGCs.  Also, the tempo of fighting games are just so much faster.  A full three-set match can be over in ten minutes. That just doesn't happen in the other eSports.

The OP said in his article that rounds in CS:GO last about 2 minutes.  You don't even get two minutes for a round in most fighting games. 

Again, little knowledge of CS:GO, but I wanted to point this out:

3275,"**Renowned Explorers: International Society**

One of my favorite indies from last year.  You select a group of three explorers from a pool of 20, and each explorer has different abilities that help the campaign (scientists, scouts, fighters, and speakers).  Your goal is to become the world's most renowned explorer over a series of five expeditions your crew embarks on.

Beyond the setup, the gameplay is similar to FTL.  Each expedition has a series of map markers which can trigger certain events: If you're in the desert, you might find a horde of scorpions you have to fight off, or you will find an oasis and get the chance to replenish your supplies and study the area for science.

During each combat encounter there's three different ways you can complete them: Aggressive (literally killing them), Friendly (convincing them that your cause is good), or Devious (basically negging them to death).  Each combat spell falls into one of these categories, and effects the combat mood.  My first successful group had an aggressive/devious build, because using enough aggresive actions causes the mood to change in a way that grants me +25% power on devious spells.

Art style is great, and it's very light-hearted (with a tiny bit of humor).  As I said before, it was definitely among my favorite indie titles this year.",2016-01-09 20:22:15+00:00,cys3hak,1.0,t3_407kay,4570.0,Games

Even before class changing becomes a reasonable option, pairing still trivializes some encounters and makes units much too durable.

I think Class Changing is a cool system but characters were far too easily broken by using it.  The only downsides to class changing is the loss/change of base stats, but it's a small price to pay when you retain all of the skills you had while also keeping the earned stat levels.

I ended up playing for about a half hour before refunding it. If you guys think I should give it another chance I'll pick it up again.

EDIT: Apparently my prediction was completely off.

**Tales From The Borderlands**

This one surprised me, especially given that I didn't enjoy the first episode very much. Each episode was better than the last, to the point that I needed to pause at times to get a hold of my laughter. [Spoiler] (#s ""The accountant shootout scene was probably the funniest thing I've seen in a video game,"") and I couldn't help but have a crazy reaction to the reveal of the masked man.

Overall, I think it's fantastic. Worse than TWD S1 and TWAU by a slim margin but far better than TWD S2. Highly recommend it.

**There Came An Echo**

If you've never heard of this game, it's a real time strategy game where you control up to four characters and give them commands via voice chat. If you ever played Sequence, now called Before The Echo, this is the second game made by that group, and features a few callbacks to the characters from those games.

I like the level design, and the characters are interesting enough. The actual gameplay is hit or miss. I spent what felt like forever trying to calibrate my mic because during tests it could never reach the proper volume range, but all of a sudden in game I was so loud that my units couldn't understand the commands. There's a mission where you need to keep one character in front of a switch and command them to hit it before 60 seconds pass after the last press. The command decided to stop working for a good ten seconds before the character decided she could hear me. Thankfully nothing else was going on with the battle during that.

If you can manage to get the mic to work 100% of the time you're looking at a fantastic game, but it just doesn't have that polish, at least not for me.

**Darkest Dungeon**

3369,"**tl;dr the game's mechanics effect playstyles the players have access to, and the players eventually discover the most efficient ways to perform these playstyles effectively.**

The meta develops and evolves as players learn efficiency and core strategies, which tend to revolve around the game's mechanics and numbers. I'll use League of Legends as an example. Keep in mind that I haven't played in a few years so I won't be keen on the finer details, but I understand the broad aspects of its meta.

The base-level Meta in League is to have a team composition that places 1 player in the top lane, 1 player in the mid lane, 1 player in the jungle, and 2 players in the bottom lane. Why is this?

* There are four sources of experience on the map: Three lanes and the jungle.
* The power of your character, especially early game, is directly tied to your level.

Because experience is divided evenly among all champions near the exp source, it makes the most sense to spread them as evenly as possible.  Efficiency comes into play here, as you're constantly draining the EXP from every source at all times.  You could run two lanes with two characters and ignore the jungle, but you're now only using ~75% of the available experience pool, while also forcing two units to share their location's experience pool, making them weaker overall. So to maximize experience gain, you spread out like I mentioned above.

So now that this has been established, players build a team around it. I could go into great detail on each role but I'll focus on the bottom lane dynamics.

First of all, why do we place 2 players in the bottom lane, as opposed to top or mid?  There exists a neutral objective called ""dragon"" which can very easily swing the game in favor of whoever kills it first.  Only sending one player down to bot and placing two in a different lane is a tactic that was used often in professional play when I still followed it, but ultimately it wasn't to the benefit of the players who did it, as they conceded their control of Dragon to their opponents.

So we send two players bot.  But who? You have to pick these champions acknowledging that both units will only have half of the experience gain they would otherwise have going solo.  Because of this, you need to pick characters who are level independent (they don't need a lot of levels to function well).  Additionally, if you can select one champion who is item independent, or doesn't necessarily need items to function well, you can opt to have them not earn gold from minion kills and give them all to your lane partner.  It's much better to have one well-farmed character and one starved character than have two poor characters, provided the starved character can function without the resources. These become the game's supports.

What determines if a character is item or level independent? Level dependence comes from what your spells bring to the table, and item dependence comes from what items exist in the game that benefit your character. A character like [Janna](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/janna/) is a great support because she doesn't need a lot of levels or items. Her skillset does not rely on damage: She has an AOE knockup, a target slow, a shield, and an AOE knockback/ally heal, all while passively increasing the move speed of those around her. Leveling these spells will grant more damage, but the main purpose of these spells are the CC effects they provide.  Speaking of her skillset being good for its utility and not it's damage, Janna does not need to buy expensive damage items like Rabadon's Deathcap or Void Staff in order for her spells to mean anything.  So she tends to be delegated to the Support role.

If Janna were to be the only character who could fulfill this role effectively, every team would require her presence on the battlefield, because it's to the benefit of the team to have a player who doesn't need gold or experience.  The meta would revolve around her because she's present in every single game. Your character selection would be influenced by knowing Janna is there.  You would want characters who synergize well with her or can easily counter her. Or, in draft mode, she would be constantly banned because the advantage she provides to the first-pick team (who would always grab her first) would be unfair.  Of course this isn't the case, as there exists a wide variety of supports, but I wanted to show an example of how the meta could be affected like this.

**So to conclude: The team benefits most from spreading their five players across four experience pools. So the meta evolved to introduce ""support"" characters who can operate with limited experience and gold gains so the other four players can become stronger and richer.**

This is getting really long but I think I explained the gist of it.  Let me know if you have any questions.",2015-12-29 20:38:47+00:00,cyfc1k4,1.0,t3_3yosr8,4130.0,explainlikeimfive

3476,"&gt; I don't know how pointing out that black people have as many associate degrees as the general populace proves anything? In fact, there's probably a very good reason for it and it has everything to do with your friends point.

The actual argument we were having had to do with the VCU students who demanded their university hire more black professors.  My argument was that it was illogical to specifically target black people for professor positions because they make up a very small percentage of masters and doctorate degrees, and used those stats as an example. iirc the university already had a black professor percentage in line with the percentage of black ""higher"" degree holders (""higher"" being degrees you would expect to have in those positions).

Anyhow, [the stats I found](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=72) showed increases of minority presence across all degrees, but the numbers were nearly 1:1 at the AA level.  I should have made that more clear. As you can see, the percentage of white degree holders dropped by about 5-8% in each tier over the span of ten years.

&gt;  Less black people in masters programs and less black people at universities means that black people seem to be 'tapping' out at associate degrees. It's kinda like taking numbers from the top group and putting them in the bottom group.

It's been five years since the last census.  We don't really know if that's the case anymore.

&gt; This is clearly a sign that something is still very wrong even though Associate degrees are the same.

3490,"&gt; He used a shitty, cherry-picked hypothetical example with zero context. I responded by referencing the actual story being discussed.

Which isn't really a counter to his statement or a defense of yours.

You are correct that /r/scalfin used a shitty example, because it isn't exactly a microaggression because it's not being directed at a person (really it's just casual racism). Regardless, if you're arguing that all cases of microaggressions are without merit (a statement I derived from ""The entire concept of a microaggression is stupid""), you DO have to be able to argue against any example of microaggressions that get brought up.

&gt; Unintentional acts are by their very nature not aggressive.

I don't think it's okay to dismiss a potentially derogatory comment because they didn't intend to offend someone. [Here's an example of a microaggression from a recent SNL skit](https://youtu.be/e2zyjbH9zzA?t=40).  Whether she intended to offend Jay Pharoh's character in this line is irrelevant, because what she said was undeniably racist.

The definition of ""Aggression"" is ""hostile or violent behavior or attitudes toward another.""  I believe (read: not defend) that the term Microaggression is derived emphasizing the ""hostile"" portion, not the violent portion which I believe you may be connecting it to.  Hostile is defined as Unfriendly or Antagonistic.  I would argue asking why a black person's ""friends"" antagonize cops is certainly antagonistic, even if it isn't directly being racist towards the person.",2015-12-14 22:28:02+00:00,cxz5iu0,6.0,t1_cxz3uj1,2609.0,news

3507,"Back into **World of Warcraft** for the winter break.

I kinda regret starting up again because I'm addicted to the grind. Well, kinda. I really don't give a shit about the end game stuff. I started playing in Mists and the thing that drew me to the end game was how interesting the world was. I loved the Klaaxi and the Sha. I still think Throne of Thunder is one of the best raids ever. In Warlords the raid design just seems so boring by comparison. I'm not really a fan of the whole Orc design and a lot of the bosses seem to lack creativity.

Story-wise it's a huge step down from Mists as well, another reason I don't like it. I just feel like everything we did was unnecessary and didn't even matter. It's bad that your final raid boss is literally the final encounter in **Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos** and I just have to say ""meh.""

What I HAVE been doing is leveling a new Monk on a new server so I can play with my friends who haven't left the game yet (the ones on my current server did).

My entire post operated under the assumption that the baby was being raised by the mother regardless. My apologies for not clarifying that. A woman going to get an abortion is a separate issue.

Regarding woman opt-outs:

* Abortion is a medical procedure for a medical condition. It has benefits outside of no longer having to take care of a child.
* The woman can't decide herself, assuming the man is still involved, to give the baby up for adoption. The man can step in and say he wants the child if he so desires.

Keep in mind that most woman opt-outs exist for women who aren't going to be getting support from the father. We've already framed this entire CMV as ""the woman is having this kid and the father should be able to say he wants no part."" 

And I don't think it's reasonable to say that it's suddenly the woman for wanting to raise her child and the father leaves. At least she's willing to take responsibility for her actions. Further, the woman shouldn't be shamed for her wanting to use state resources when it wasn't her initial plan.",2015-11-26 20:15:16+00:00,cxe0gc0,3.0,t1_cxdp844,21619.0,changemyview

3614,"Disclosure: my dad was forced to pay child support for three kids when my mom had absolutely no need for it financially.

It's important to understand how this works from the perspective of the government.  Let's say that a man in any given situation just decided he won't be caring for the child.  Without child support, the woman is now in a situation where she has to have a full time job to support the kid she won't be getting to see nearly as much as she should in its developmental stages.

The child support system exists to alleviate this issue: the woman can now afford to place the kid in day care or hire a nanny or something. Both her and her child get to have an increased quality of living for this.

What does this mean for the government? Less tax money invested into this family. The woman doesn't need welfare and the kid is less likely to end up on the streets or committing crimes. So when you have a father who just wants to say ""I want nothing to do with this,"" in a certain way, he's telling the state ""this kid is your problem to deal with,"" and the government doesn't want to, and in my opinion shouldn't have to, have this financial burden.

Now a lot of what I just wrote does operate under the assumption that the guy had agency in his Sexual activity with the woman. For that reason I will be skipping your scenarios that imply this and focus on the immoral aspects.

Say that you were in the place of the government and you had to be financially responsible for this kid if the man won't be, wouldn't you be a little worried about the financial burden? You're going to make damn sure that the guy was truly deceived or raped before making that commitment.

And how easy is it to prove that the girl lied to you about, or tampered with, the birth control? Pretty damn hard, if not impossible. And to further the point, why are we using this as an end-all argument to say the guy shouldn't be liable for the child? I don't think any existing birth control has 100% effectiveness, and the man still made the decision to risk this outcome by having sex in the first place. ""But I am on the pill"" wouldn't get her out of the baby, it shouldn't work for the man.

Rape is an entirely different issue, and I think we both agree this is a definite case for being free from responsibility.",2015-11-26 11:12:13+00:00,cxdm6ws,1.0,t3_3ubiv6,14717.0,changemyview

There are plenty of legitimate presidential candidates that you will never hear about, because the only ones people know about are Democrat and Republican.  Super PACs contribute to this problem.  The amount of research you would need to do to make an informed decision is significantly greater than you're letting on.

About half way in and it's easily my favorite campaign so far.  The protoss are by far the most interesting race and it definitely shows in the story.

I just recommend setting your game speed to 'Fast' because Protoss warp ins take FOREVER compared to unit building in the other two races.

I don't do much multiplayer in this but they made everything way faster.  They doubled the number of workers you get at the start so have to start expanding way sooner.

The only way we knew The Lost even existed in the game is because there was an achievement called ""The Lost."" Edmund created an ARG for fans to figure out, which would tell you how to unlock him.  The unlock method is pretty ridiculous, requiring you to die in four consecutive runs in four specific ways (dying to specific enemies in specific floors, for the most part).  In other words, solving the ARG was the only way to unlock The Lost, because literally no one would ever unlock him on accident.

However, someone datamined the process (aka went through the files and found the flags to trigger his unlock), completely circumventing the ARG Edmund created.  As a result, he was very upset.",2015-11-04 01:21:29+00:00,cwnm7oz,6.0,t1_cwnle0x,1280.0,Games

4034,"Interesting how rushed this episode felt, since it had a month longer dev cycle than all the other episodes.

I didn't like how psycho evil they made Jefferson become. I didn't like how Warren just accepted Max's explanation of her powers (not to mention the whole ""this storm is your fault!"" Thing). Nathan dying was a little odd.

The worst part of this episode for me was the nightmare though. It just dragged way too long and could have made its point in half of the time. That time should have gone to developing the conversation Alex has with herself. Mechanics were silly too.

Ending itself wasn't bad I don't think, but I definitely see why people feel cheated. They didn't put enough focus on the tornado, so finding out that you caused it all makes it feel like a plot twist out of left field. In a ""the journey not the destination"" way I thought the sacrifice of Chloe was a fantastic decision even if it invalidated everything in the story up to that point.

For those not aware, it's about a group of 15 Japanese high school students who are trapped in their school by a mysterious person, and are forced to murder each other in order to escape.

It feels like a cross between the Zero Escape series (trapped with others, the entire concept of betrayal) and Phoenix Wright (part of the game involves figuring out who committed each murder).

There are many quality of life mechanics that make it better than PW. You can hit Triangle to reveal all of the locations of a room that can be investigated, for example. Pretty much every gripe I have with PW was fixed in this game.

Problem? I feel like they didn't capitalize on how dark the game could have been. Comparing to how violent 999 (and to a lesser extent VLR) gets, you'd think a game whose entire premise is murder would be a little darker. Only the first couple of deaths were even graphic, and none of them shake up the group dynamic in any significant way.

I don't think people are using a LOT of control-type cards anyway since they want to stay on curve, because the game I've played my Thaurissan stays on board until Chromaggus comes out.  Usually my finisher is Pyroblast but it depends on the board state, since I use both arcane intellects as soon as they're available.",2015-10-07 18:45:11+00:00,cvrkmmr,1.0,t3_3nuj6v,13448.0,hearthstone

&gt; And as for paying for it, we already put out billions of dollars in grants/aid each year anyway, that we pay for. Our grant programs could fund most if not all of the tuition for state universities each year if used correctly. That means you wouldn't really be paying more.

Would it really be as easy as just taking all of those grants and aid and putting it towards a free tuition system? Wouldn't that cause people to lose their refund checks? And wouldn't that make private universities more difficult to afford for those who take that route?

The market hasn't allowed companies to charge more for their games upfront (inflation puts $60 in 2005 equal to $73 today) so they have to start finding other ways to increase revenue. That's why we have DLC which is proportionately more expensive than the main game, and now microtransactions.

For what it's worth I haven't seen a review for a game *only* discuss political issues.  The last one that comes to mind that even dealt with this was Polygon's review of Dragon's Crown and it's character design.

I think being tired of ANOTHER game with ANOTHER white male military lead is valid. I will be the first to admit that Wolfenstein, of all games, should get a pass for it considering the time frame and nature of the plot, but it's a very, VERY tired plot device even ignoring the political side of it. On the same token, I would love if I could play a JRPG that didn't culminate in THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP saving the day for once, even though Persona 4 is by and far my favorite JRPG.

It's a valid criticism because story and narrative is *a part of the game*, that the designers *chose* to implement.  Not liking the protagonist is a valid criticism of the narrative, and thus the game as a whole.

4292,"**Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm**

I bought the complete edition for $60 after playing a lot of Heroes of the Storm.  I figured I needed to actually see what was so great about Starcraft.

It's actually a lot more accessible than I was expecting, but I have two years of MOBA experience so I probably had an easier time than most would.  My campaign experience basically goes like this: Expand as far as I can, get a crapton of units, and wreck face until the mission is over, which does get kinda dull after a while, so the occasional defense mission helped shake it up for me.

I hope there was a large amount of criticism regarding the release structure for single-player content.  After playing enough of multiplayer to realize that Protoss is by far my favorite race, I'm really annoyed that I can't play as them in single player outside of the four mission mini-campaign in Wings of Liberty.  I can only imagine how Protoss mains have been feeling since SC2 first came out five years ago.  Both WC3 and SC1 had a campaign for each of the games' factions in the initial release, and an additional campaign for each in their expansions.  I suppose the production quality accounts for part of the fact that they only released one campaign per expansion (27 Terran missions is quite a bit more than 9 human WC3 missions after all).

Overall, it's a fun little romp in a sci-fi universe, and I forgot how much I loved the setting.  I need more Sci-Fi games in my life.",2015-08-22 20:21:48+00:00,cuc3yxb,1.0,t3_3hzxge,4544.0,Games

For example, in the fourth episode [Spoiler](#s ""there is an event involving a drug dealer, where you have to get information from him."")  There are quite a few scenarios that affect the outcome of this event, including one of three different possibilities for the possession of a gun, whether [Spoiler](#s ""the dealer's dog died"") in episode 3, and whether you [Spoiler](#s ""stole money from the school"") in episode 3.

The best part about this is that DESPITE these things permanently affecting the outcome of the event, you can rewind to the beginning of the event and play out the dialog wheels differently to gain a different outcome, but for the majority of important choices in the game they all have downsides.  The one I mentioned has a definite good side (in fact, because I happened to possess the gun, it was impossible for me to get the worst outcome that forced a restart), but most others don't have that luxury.

Most of them are high schoolers and the few that aren't are heavily agenda-driven (such as the security guard and the principal) so they appear to make no sense at times.

One thing this game does very well compared to the TellTale games is the ability to take both directions in a plot branch.  Wanna tell your bully to go fuck off but feel awful after you do it? Rewind and make peace.  Of course, if you feel like making peace didn't accomplish what you wanted, just rewind time again and tell her to fuck off and move on.  There's pretty much never a reason not to see both outcomes because the game, as it's main plot device, enables you to do so.

4432,"&gt; It doesn't indicate the nature of women's representation in a movie, just whether they meet three criteria. You could have a movie that's just an award winning discussion between a woman who was raped and a female detective about the rapist, and it wouldn't pass. I saw the transcript of that video, and several of the movies she lists aren't sexist.

She fully admits that.

&gt; Again, to be clear this test does not gauge the quality of a film, It doesn't determine whether a film is feminist or not, and it doesn't even determine whether a film is women centered. Some pretty awful movies, including ones that have stereotypical and/or sexist representations of women might pass the test with flying colors, while really well made films that I would highly recommend might not.

According to Sarkeesian the test should be used to gauge the roles women have in movies in the grand scheme of things.  If 40 movies come out and only 8 of them have female characters who aren't defined by the men they're surrounded by, there's an issue.  It doesn't mean Movie #4 is better than Movie #47 because one has female characters and the other doesn't.",2015-07-02 00:32:09+00:00,cspc7mj,5.0,t1_csp86hl,7273.0,todayilearned

4475,"&gt; *Yes, you could argue Baristan Selmey was also major, but his death was so early that it's probably a deviation instead of a spoiler.

Also adding to this, the death of Hizdar zo Loraq, and essentially the removal of threat from Yunkai shows that there is very little resemblance to her book plot.",2015-06-19 01:40:40+00:00,csbet3h,2.0,t1_csaohg0,42386.0,gameofthrones

4482,"Or...I define it that way because I use it that way. I really don't care about the DLC because I'm only ever going to buy these when I want a new collectable on my shelf, and given the price I really like the way they look and feel.

You have to understand that I'm not gonna play the games that offend in the ""physical DLC"" department.  I don't even play half the ones that don't. Apparently I'm a blind fan boy even though I don't own half of their games. ",2015-06-17 03:22:13+00:00,cs964o3,4.0,t1_cs95mk3,924.0,Games

If they release too many N3DS titles they will end up pissing off a lot of people, and developers probably don't wanna support a new model of the 3DS right away.",2015-06-17 01:58:05+00:00,cs93dyg,1.0,t3_3a437z,162.0,Games

4490,"&gt; They're glorified on disk DLC that is way too expensive to be DLC.

It's utterly ridiculous to simplify it that far.  I own a Toad and a Samus amiibo because I want one, not because I wanted the hyper CPU or the random MK8 costumes.

There ARE examples of these being physical DLC tokens but it's ridiculous to lump them all into this category.",2015-06-17 01:36:48+00:00,cs92myv,2.0,t1_cs920re,1070.0,Games
4491,"On the other hand, some things legitimately are locked-out content, although I thing the rage it gets is undeserved.

One example off the top of my head in the Triforce Spinner in Hyrule Warriors, which is only available if you scan a Link/Toon Link amiibo. In my opinion this is one of the best weapons in the game, and more likely than not the item drop gives you a T3 weapon which is wayyyyyyyyyy more powerful than the T1 and T2 weapons.",2015-06-17 01:34:49+00:00,cs92kgh,2.0,t1_cs9294z,543.0,Games
4492,Keep in mind just how different it is in the book though.  Honestly I think the only spoiler we got for the Stannis brigade was the death of Shireen (and I suppose Selyse as well).
