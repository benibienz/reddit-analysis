In round 2 and three he just started running around not doing anything and just went on saying the things he was saying in the screen shot.

I personally don't think this will happen, and I think Sansa will be the one to become Lord of Winterfell and Warden(ess?) of the North - at least, she will in the show.

I think the important piece to remember here is Bran's place in the greater narrative - as the replacement of the Three-Eyed Raven.  Recall the conversation the Raven has with Bran just before his death:

&gt; Raven: The time as come.

&gt; Bran: For what?

&gt; Raven: For you to become me.

&gt; Bran: But... Am I ready?

&gt; Raven: No.

This was the end goal for the Raven.  It was always his intention for Bran to replace him when the time came, and it's why Benjen has returned as well. At the end of the series, even if Bran returns to Winterfell, it is not his place to be.  His power will have no place in view of regular society.  Though I'm sure there's more literal reasons for his placement, The Raven exists so far beyond the wall because it's the safest (other than the Walkers of course), and because of the presence of Weirwood trees.  He just can't exist so close to man.

If anyone else has any thoughts please feel free to post them, but I just don't see Bran becoming the Lord of Winterfell in the show's version of the narrative, or at all for that matter.

tl;dr Bran is technically next in line for the Lord of Winterfell, but the narrative has demonstrated that he won't be taking that spot.",gameofthrones,[EVERYTHING] Bran's place in the line of succession,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4oxe9b/everything_brans_place_in_the_line_of_succession/

If you only played enough games to complete each of your quests, and only got 2-win 40-gold quests every day until your goal, you will have 3500 gold on August 28.  Each daily quest being 40 gold will generate an additional 6.667 gold/day based on wins, totaling 46.667/day.  Obtaining 3500 gold this way will take you 75 days, ending on August 28.

Now, no one saving gold actually does this.  They re-roll (at bare minimum) all 40 gold quests for a chance at getting the highest gold quests.  So if we take the average gold of every quest after re-rolling a 40 gold quest (taking into account losing some days to getting the spectator quest), you're looking at earning an average of 48.857 gold per quest, taking you an average of 3.229 wins/day to achieve (or an additional 10.763 gold/day).  **So at 59.62 gold/day, you'll actually earn 3500 gold by August 11.**  This also assumes you win all 7 games for the 100-gold quest.

I'm personally predicting that the adventure will launch on August 4, giving you plenty of time to earn enough gold to obtain all of the wings with plenty of time to spare.

Based on [last year's schedule](https://www.vg247.com/2015/07/07/evo-2015-full-schedule-revealed/), you can expect the stream schedule to look something like this:

    9am: MKX
    11am: Marvel
    1pm: Xrd
    4pm: Melee
    7pm: Street Fighter
    *This is purely conjecture.  These are not confirmed stream times.

A few notable changes from the last couple of years:

* Marvel has almost always taken the spot before Street Fighter, which (I'm pretty sure) has headlined every Evo since SF4 launched.  Now Melee has taken that spot.  Melee has gone from being ""not a fighting game"" in the opinion of the FGC to one of its biggest titles.  Marvel being moved up to so early in the day is undoubtedly because of its drop in popularity these last couple years.
* Historically, anime fighting games have always been the first games played on Finals day.  It was true for Guilty Gear last year and for Blazblue the year before that.  Being moved up to just before Melee is awesome to see, in my opinion. It's a genuinely fantastic game.  Of course, MKX takes that typical slot, which is honestly quite surprising to me.
* I know SFV had a botched launch but as of late April [Over 4000 people](https://esports.yahoo.com/evos-record-setting-registration-hits-4000-and-161815229.html) have registered to play.

Her mobility destroys Zenyatta's, she has better HPS (and in my opinion a better utility with the damage amp) and her survivability is much greater too.  Zenyatta does have better offensive capabilities, but most of this is limited by his lack of mobility and sheer squishiness.  Unlike Mercy, Zen will die instantly to a body shot from Widow, and getting caught out in general will basically mean the death of him.  Mercy has many escape options while *also* having more health.

I personally feel that Zen's massive shield (relative to his overall health pool at least) is one of his primary strengths.  Even if he takes damage he's more than likely going to be shrugging all of it off three seconds later - unlike Zarya or Symmetra who might be missing some health after a scrap.  However, this strength is essentially nullified because Mercy can regenerate her entire health pool as though she is 100% shields. I feel this is inconsistent with the rules of the game, and ultimately is one of the things holding Zenyatta back from decent playability.  She's taken (and improved upon) one of Zenyatta's few strengths, leaving him inferior to her in almost every way.

I do acknowledge that without self-healing, Mercy would be in a bad spot.  I feel that giving her the ability to heal herself while healing someone else could fix this, even if it's something small like 10-15 hps (this is about the same as Lucio's unamped healing).  This way she can retain her power while also giving her something that actually feels unique.  As it stands right now though, they might as well give Mercy 200 shields instead of any sort of health bar.

* Shake up the meta, which has grown rather stale as of late
* Remove blatantly overpowered cards from the pool
* Remove very swingy, RNG-based cards
* Hopefully, set a precedent that leads to banlists in future, more high-profile tournaments

So to kick it off, I'm going to be banning based on popular opinion.  Every day I'll compile the two most popular card bans and add them to the official ban list.  That way, after cards get banned, those who voted for them can vote again on different cards.  Ultimately I'm wanting to ban about 10-20 cards, but we can ban more if desired.

&gt; If you want the RPG with the most skills, the most stats to consider, and a world that constantly makes meaningful use of every line on your character sheet, there’s nothing else quite like Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition. You can find RPGs that are prettier, more accessible, or less busy, but very few are as dedicated to the true spirit of role-playing as this one is.

&gt; Ultimately, playing Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition on consoles is a fantastic experience. It may not be the best way to play, as PC still reigns supreme, but it’s a fantastic version of an already great game. If you’re willing to roll the die, and have luck decide your fate, then you’ll have a blast playing through Larian Studios’ update of Divinity: Original Sin. 

[thesixthaxis](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/27/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review/) - [Spoiler](#s ""8/10"")

&gt; Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition is an in-depth and thoughtful RPG that offers console gamers an experience normally reserved for PC gamers. It’s pace and mechanics may take some getting used to and there are a few mild technical issues, but for those willing to put the time and effort in there are countless hours of questing and combat here that should enthral any RPG fan.

[GodIsAGeek](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review/) - [Spoiler](#s ""8.5/10"")

&gt; Outside the deep crafting and gathering systems, combat is where Divinity: Original Sin shines brightest. It’s not easy, and will repeatedly remind you of the importance of regular quick-saves, but the combat is excellent. Turn-based, everything you do costs Action Points, of which you have a limited pool decided by stats, gear and character build. Ranged and melee classes have a variety of Stances they can drop into to bolster different attributes, while the amount of spells on offer for casters is dizzying. While that’s all tactical enough, the real fun comes from using the environment. You can ignite oil or gas, freeze or electrify water, either with spells or bombs. You can even carry candles, ignite them during a fight and throw them at explosive barrels or puddle of oil to damage your enemies. Combat is unforgiving, but a little preparation and imagination will carry you a long way.

[Playstation Universe](http://www.psu.com/review/28475/Divinity--Original-Sin--Enchanced-Edition-PS4-Review) - [Spoiler](#s ""9/10"")

&gt; Divinity is easily one of the better games I’ve played this year; no mean feat considering the competition and the difficulty of the game itself. The way it marries a light-hearted, daft charm with serious peril and punishing gameplay is the stuff videogames could do with a bit more of nowadays. Divinity stands as a proud and fitting tribute to cRPGs of the past whilst having a wonderfully eccentric personality of its own. If you’re hankering for a modernised blast from the past that will swallow your free time whole if you succumb to its wares, then Divinity: Original Sin is a great way to scratch that itch.

[Push Square](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/divinity_original_sin_-_enhanced_edition) - [Spoiler](#s ""9/10"")

&gt; A splendid RPG that tests your skills and your brain, Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition is a challenging, sprawling, and enchanting title from the very start. Our only quibble is a complex UI that can sometimes get a little too busy, but it doesn't take away from the game's many strengths. Not only does it have an impressive combat system and interesting quests, it features a reactive world that you can truly leave your mark on. Add in a winning sense of humour, well thought-out gameplay systems, and a charming aesthetic, and you're left with an RPG that would be a sin to miss.",Games,Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition Review Thread,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/3qdjs5/divinity_original_sin_enhanced_edition_review/

So the first date went okay. We just had coffee and talked for a little while. I definitely didn't see the connection I saw with other dates I've had in the past but I figured I would give it another go because he is cute.

Anyway, our second date is basically a Netflix and Chill kind of night. We watched one of my favorite movies and he just didn't seem as into it as I thought he would but the cuddling was nice so I stay a little longer for the ""chill"" portion.

So we're laying in his bed (keep in mind we've known each other for just over a week at this point including Tinder conversation) and he makes a few weird comments. Though we didn't end up going all the way but he told me he made sure to buy lube and stuff. He specifically said ""gotta do it for my man."" Some other parts of our conversation just struck me the wrong way and overall I was just not feeling any sort of desire to be there - in the sort of clingy/creepy vibe way. Thankfully he was adamant about me not staying the night so I got dressed and as I was walking out he said ""love you,"" which I didn't even have a response to. I just hurriedly left.

I'm definitely going to break it off but I'm just not sure how. What do I even say? I don't really want to do it in person because I'm afraid he won't take it well, and I don't want to deal with the associated public embarrassment. Doing it over text is just a crappy thing to do though.
