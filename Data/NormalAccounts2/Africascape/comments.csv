But what I want, hell I just want to be able to do things I like for me. I want to be able to not worry about how Im going to eat, or pay bills. I want to be able to go out and do something fun when Im not at work, instead of sit at home with no money.

Now this would likely have happened during the release of the boss, which you can argue is an advantage because of the hype train. In reality it is going to take a team of all people with 0 kill count far less attempts to be successful then it did on release because of all the guides available.
