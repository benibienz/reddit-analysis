66,"#Recent Changes:

We have made some changes based on feedback from people.
##Change 1: Speed Improvements
First change is that we now only load 500 contests by default, this will help with the loading time some, you can choose to load more by using a drop down at the top of the page, or if you get to the end of the list, there is a button to load 500 more contests.  Keep in mind the search tool, only searches contests that have been loaded, it will not show you contests that are unloaded.  We have also done numerous other backend changes, such as switching to ajax to load the data in, which also should help.

##Change 2: User Experience
We have also added in auto-checking for new contests.  Every few minutes the site will automatically see if there are any new contests since you last loaded it, if there are new ones found, it will autoadd them to the top of the list and put an icon to the left of the link (icon may or may not change).  Here is an [Example](https://i.imgur.com/yieLxg0.jpg).  When it finds a new contest, a noatification will also briefly display on the page, if you are actively using it, that way if you are not at the top of the page, you will still be alerted that new contests were added.  Finally if you are using a browser that is tabbed and have the site opened, but are not actively in that tab, when a new contest is found, the tab title will flash every now and then letting you know there are new contests, until you visit that tab.  
*Please note, that because of the way mobile devices work(most non-desktops/laptops), unless you are actively using the page, new contests will not be added (they go into a sleep state, and the code to keep checking for new contests stops)*

#Bugs:
##iPad/Mobile:
We are still looking into issues reported by some people in regards to mobile and iPad experience being slow/freezing.  I have used it on my phone, and found that the changes to speed we have made have improved it quite a bit, but we are looking into it more, one solution may be if you are detected on a mobile device or ipad then  removing the sorting on load of data by date added, this seems to take the most time, and I believe may make a difference, there is a button at the top of the side bard, that would let you sort after the data has loaded if you want.  We are not sure if we will do this or look into other options.",2016-11-04 16:40:00+00:00,d9loj0x,1.0,t3_5al1tz,249872.0,sweepstakes

75,"[Here](http://checkrepost.com/Weekly.htm) is a link to contests ending this week, it will be automatically updated daily as normal.

The new site does not replace that, it is different functionality and purpose. The new system will contain contests that are not posted on reddit, since it comes from other sources and it is limited to gleam.io contests only currently, while the contests ending this week page is for contests that have been posted to the subreddits only. The reason why the new site does not have ""world wide"" is because Gleam.io does not ""region lock"" for world wide, the closest thing would be ""Unknown"" because those are the ones where gleam is not returning any region lock information.  To test an example for what region locking means in gleam, try clicking one of the links that you are not eligible for, you will get a message saying it is not available in your region.  This ""region locking"" information is normally not available to the user if they are of that region (for example I may find a gleam contest that is region locked to the US, but since I'm from the US, I would have no way of knowing unless they put it in the T&amp;C as well (which they often do not).",2016-11-02 01:45:38+00:00,d9hrk0c,2.0,t1_d9hpz7o,1936.0,sweepstakes

110,"I reformatted your response to make it easier to read for everyone.

Oh boy... let's go through this quickly. 

* Oddly enough... we are more set apart from other VR titles for embracing VR yet trying to reach traditional users as much as possible.  VR is uber cool and there are ton of things in our game that highlights the technology and it was built to perform around it.  However, we believe nature of FUN and what makes gameplay great for the shooter genre does not change because of VR.  Keeping those balance and introducing gamers into the first gen of VR platform is what we are doing differently than other titles.  

* User time spent in our game / week... That is an incredibly important question.  Obviously, our goal is for people to play as much as possible and also make sure that you can spend long period of time in VR.  

* progression: Yes.  And it will get more advanced.  
plans after release: Yes to all and we have some surprises.  Look forward to upcoming Playstation Experience for taste of what's to come.

* Rigs is a fantastic game.  Please go enjoy it!  Although we believe some of our users will overlap, we believe our game is unique enough where it will have its own core followers.  I personally compare it as: ""Others are making more of Gran Turismo and Forza of FPS.  We are making Mariokart of FPS genre.""

* Biggest struggle is that we are taking on a huge challenge for a small team.  We went from starting a company, gathering talents (still gathering), making a game, promoting the game in about 2 years.  Launch Beta version is nowhere near the full vision we have for our game.  Biggest challenge I suppose is time. 

* We already to.  Come to our website, FB, Twitter, Reddit and our Twitch broadcast.  We take all our announcement straight to our fans first. ",2016-10-12 16:35:31+00:00,d8oyxi1,3.0,t1_d8ox8ie,1987.0,PSVR

The reason I do this instead of cash or debit is because I earn rewards for using my credit card, for example I have the amazon.com chase card, which means every purchase I make at Amazon I earn 3% back, so that is equivalent to getting 3% off.  It also does 2% at things like gas stations.  I have other cards as well and use the one that gives the best rewards possible for each situation.

170,"Yeah, I'm assuming those are after people cancelled they would put a few up in a batch.  you would think they would get cancelled before the people on the 22nd, but maybe their inventory system works different, in that they allocated a specific unit to an order, when that order is cancelled, instead of allocating it to an oversold person (which they probably didn't think was oversold) it was put back in stock, and so someone else bought it.  

Basically say they have 1000 units total but sold 1500 on the 22nd(numbers are completely made up).  If I was the 4th one to order one on the 22nd, I would have unit 4, if I cancelled, instead of being allocated to someone who ordered say 1001, it goes back into stock and order 1501 two days later when they opened up orders again, would get unit 4.

To be honest, just because someone is a famous YouTuber and even if they did legit giveaways on their own before, it does not mean they aren't scamming now or involved in some other form of Tom-foolery. Not saying that GGUK is scamming or anything, I personally at this point don't think they are, but if they have actually given prizes to the past winners it should be very simple process to prove that and get their current contest reinstated.

You can email gleam directly with contests that appear to be fake, just send an email to hello@gleam .io (without the space) providing the link to the contest and why you think it is fake. One of the downsides of having one of the best contest platforms that has built in social actions but also provides a free tier is that some people will take advantage of it and try to defraud people. I've won contests and received the prize in contests I could have sworn were fake and also has ones I had no doubt were legit and won but they flaked out in providing the prize. So it really is hard to say for sure if a contest is real or not. If in doubt report it, if they are real they should be able to prove it to gleam and get their contest reenabled.

You also didn't include Option 4 of no votes disqualified, since this appears to possibly be a sanctioned (or at least not against the rules) form of getting votes according to Intel, the 4th option is to let the contest continue as is, and the 3 competitors who are not using this tactic(that has been discovered at least), should start ASAP.

This was posted well over 48 hours after you had last posted it. It was actually posted about 68 Hours after you had last posted it.  No one owns any contests here, they are all fair game for reposting per the reposting rules and it isn't like this was even sniped, 20 hours past when it could have been reposted is more than reasonable amount of time.

Looking at both of your recent post histories, there is maybe 2 posts that secretlyowned had reposted around the time of this comment that you had last reposted and both were well over 48 hours after you had last posted.  Though it appears you may be sniping many of secretlyowned's in retaliation for this perceived slight.

This is not the first time you have acted entitled and belligerent towards other users for supposedly ""stealing all of your posts"".  If you continue to ""attack"" other users through Private Messages or public comments like this, the mods will take action against your account per rule 10.  

Please be civil to other users and remember that all posts are fair game for reposting, which I know you are aware of since you snipe posts frequently.  That is unless some is specifically targeting **every single post**(not just 1 or 2) of one user.",2016-06-29 14:38:06+00:00,d4skugr,2.0,t1_d4rqmdl,62067.0,giveaways

But nowhere on the contest pages themselves does it state this fact, so it is misleading to people, which is our main concern (people will see all the contests and think you are giving away 20 macbooks, vs 20 contests running to win the same macbook).

Also if you look at the most active poster list now compared to 2 months ago it looks different, the active poster list has changed, some people have left, others have come in, which is why the first option is being offered again.  We are also seeing an increase of about 100 posts per day compared to 2 months ago, which is a 33% increase, and the majority of those are reposts, so the dynamics of the subreddit are changing.

After this vote, I personally don't have any interest in approaching it again for at least a year.",2016-01-27 21:37:03+00:00,czeclap,4.0,t1_czebbuj,1657.0,giveaways
1125,"Well there have basically been two complaints, the first being too cluttered, for example yesterday we had 375 posts, 45 were new (so 12% of posts were new), and even using the filters, it still means going through multiple pages to just see New ones, doubling repost time means half as many reposts.

The other complaint is ""unfairness"" regarding people sniping contests (or reposting so quickly they are impossible to snipe).  Which either the 23/24 rule or limiting number of reposts would alleviate to differing degrees. Keep in mind that would just limit your reposts, so if you didn't post it the day before, it isn't your repost, and if it is a new contest, it isn't a repost, etc.

We are opening it up to the community to decide what direction they want to go, and we will adjust and enforce the rules accordingly.

I have my own thoughts and opinions about each of the various issues and options, but I'll stay out of it as a mod :)

Personally I think we should fix things via the rules of the subreddit instead of trying to deceive/screw with the users posting.  If your problem is now threefold, posting ineligible contests (which the consensus so far seems to agree shouldn't be done, though maybe give leeway incase of accidental posting), posting low value contests (minimum $value), and the number of contests a user can post in a 24 hour period, the first 2 are easily solved via rules if that is what is decided, the third is also solvable via rules but enforceability is another matter for those that want to get around it easily could.",2016-01-26 19:24:19+00:00,czcvl2f,5.0,t1_czcu1zj,2044.0,sweepstakes

I am all for a rule that does not allow that if the contest has referral links. If there is no way in getting referral points I don't see any issues with someone posting a link they are ineligible for  to share with the community. 

The other issue is post limits. I think this is much harder to enforce unless it is gleam where a user has a single id that is shared between all contests, so we the mods could identify those and take necessary action, but on every other contest type, what is stopping someone from making an alt to get around the post count enforcement issue? I think that would be near impossible to control long term other than with gleam ones (or any other platform that happen to have a single ref id across contests) 

It is very possible adjusting the rules to take care of the first issue may take care of the second. ",2016-01-26 06:07:32+00:00,czc99a4,1.0,t3_42pwcy,5082.0,sweepstakes

1307,"I will not get into it too much with you, since I know that I clearly have pissed you off with the amount of posts that I have, and honestly there isn't much I can say to change the fact that you want me to post less.  But I do have a few counter points to make in response to your post.

First it takes me a lot of time and effort to find giveaways, it isn't something I have automated in anyway, yes I have a personal system for trying to find them, but it takes significant effort and time from me to find them.  I will spend hours of my time looking for new contests, I may go through 300 links finding mostly reposts or uninteresting contests before I find a new one I like, and then about 50% of the time, someone else has already found it and posted it before me.  Anyone else who posts a lot of contests that doesn't just post whatever they find will attest that doing so takes time and effort on their parts as well.

Second point is, I am not the highest poster here, looking at data from the database, in the past 24 hours, I have the third highest total amount of posts(around 10% of the total posts in the past 24 hours), so while yes I do post a lot, I am not the one with the most posts in fact I am far from having a majority of the posts.

Finally, I don't pick up ""all the crumbs"" as you say, there are over 100 contests that were last posted over 24 hours ago and less than 48 hours ago that have not been reposted by anyone from what I can see (my numbers could be off, but it is pretty close to 100 if not more) I'm sure some of those expired yesterday and that is why, but clearly there are a lot of contests that I have not posted, a number of those contests (about 10) are ones I had posted as well.",2015-12-29 18:38:44+00:00,cyf76fo,6.0,t1_cyf4q8p,3699.0,giveaways

1419,"Hi jay196, I would be glad to help you assist you.  Basically the rules currently state that a link to a contest can be shared a total of one time every 24 hours.  So yesterday (11/22/2015) zohart posted this link [LG V10 International (11/29/15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/giveaways/comments/3tsj94/lg_v10_international_112915/) at 2:54:29 AM EST.  

That means that any posts made for the same contest until 11/23/2015 at 2:54:29 AM EST would be considered a repost.  There were multiple people who posted it yesterday and had it removed, because of this fact.  It appears that no one had reposted it after 2:54:29 AM today, so I posted it (I tried searching and scrolling through the lists of posts on new).  

The repost tool had an issue where the tool filling the data was offline for a time, so it is currently having a few issues.  We (/u/Albuyeh and myself) are working on rewriting it's matching algorithm.  It is going to be much more accurate when it is done, it is still useful to find possible reposts in the meantime, but it is also useful to use reddit search.  To do things like search for the contest prize for example (search for V10 in this case or LG V10 and sort by new).

If you have any other questions, or need me to clarify anything, please let me know :)",2015-11-23 16:39:36+00:00,cxa9dj1,4.0,t1_cxa7vor,2396.0,giveaways

Apparently you and me have been reposting each other back and forth for the past 3 days or so on this one.  While technically yours have all been reposts as per the rules, I am going to remove mine from tonight and from now on we will go based on this for what is a repost.

Just so you don't think I'm just claiming mine were not the reposts, here is a timeline of posts:

Edit: to be clear my personal stance is to limit frequency of reposting, but I am against limiting the total number of reposts unless it is a very large number, going out and finding contests takes work, and by limiting that too much, you are effectively limiting the incentive for people to find and post more, which while getting referrals benefits them, it benefits the less frequent posters as well by providing a place for them to find contests to enter.

It is the reputation of the email server (has it been reported as a source of spam before, is it known to have issues, etc.) not the individual user, so if they use some kind of shared email provider, even if they themselves have not spammed, could mean their email server has a poor reputation.  Lake of properly configured SPF and DKIM also can hurt the ability for email to make it into your inbox. Then there is also the exact words and patterns of language in the email, different spam filtering software has different rules, and different scoring systems, but that can be the final hurdle an email must pass to make it into your inbox :)",2015-11-17 19:43:49+00:00,cx3mtdc,3.0,t1_cx32fid,45116.0,sweepstakes

1685,"Hello,

I just want to respond to this complaint (this is copied from a reply to another complaint in this subreddit).  The only subreddits I am posting contests in frequently are /r/sweepstakes and /r/giveaways.  /r/giveaways has a rule where you are allowed to repost once every 24 hours, and both encourage the use of individual referral links for contests.  So while I am submitting links, I am keeping them inside Subreddits where they belong  and following the rules of those subreddits.  I am not posting these links into any other subreddits where they might be considered spam (for example I'm not posting a contest for a wii u in the nintendo and wiiu subreddits because that would be spamming).  

I have messages the moderators of /r/spam asking for clarification if it is against the rules but I did not receive a response.  If this is against the rules, I will gladly cease my activity, I only want to follow the rules, I have no interest in being a spammer and try to make sure what I am doing does not break the rules of the subreddits I post to.",2015-11-05 00:20:48+00:00,cwotcoz,1.0,t3_3r4rum,267413.0,spam

There was actually one company that used to run a ton of contests on gleam, but when gleam noticed the announcements by the company of who won did not match who even entered the contest, they shut them down.

I just want to respond to this complaint (this is copied from a reply to another complaint in this subreddit).  The only subreddits I am posting contests in frequently are /r/sweepstakes and /r/giveaways.  /r/giveaways has a rule where you are allowed to repost once every 24 hours, and both encourage the use of individual referral links for contests.  So while I am submitting links, I am keeping them inside Subreddits where they belong  and following the rules of those subreddits.  I am not posting these links into any other subreddits where they might be considered spam (for example I'm not posting a contest for a wii u in the nintendo and wiiu subreddits because that would be spamming).  

I have messages the moderators of /r/spam asking for clarification if it is against the rules but I did not receive a response.  If this is against the rules, I will gladly cease my activity, I only want to follow the rules, I have no interest in being a spammer and try to make sure what I am doing does not break the rules of the subreddits I post to.",2015-10-15 20:58:13+00:00,cw13c2j,1.0,t3_3n05dl,1302299.0,spam

I would take as much time as you can.  When I had my daughter at the end of last year, I was able to take 2 weeks, though one of that was in the hospital, and I wish I had been able to take more.

Though if your total time off is more limited, save some up for when your child is a few months older, those first few weeks are more to help your partner then anything else because your baby will basically just sleep then wake up to poop and eat now and then before falling back to sleep.

I purposefully will post contests once or twice and then stop reposting, in order to give other people a chance (such as the batman PS4 that rangersfan26 has posted multiple times, that I originally had been the first to post but chose to stop in order to let others have a shot).  There are some contests I care more about, that I will post more frequently and not stop trying to be the one to repost them.  I appreciate not being limited by the mods.  It really is a big time and energy investment to post content, hunt for new contests and especially to monitor and repost after 24 hours.  

I do understand the idea of limiting posts per day and even sympathize with it, but I think if something was ever implemented to cut down on reposts, that would be the wrong approach.  I am not sure if this would work but I had the idea of you can only repost yourself every 48 hours instead 24 (so you have to wait a day inbetween reposting your own content), other people can repost what you posted after 24, but I think that could get ugly, with people racing to post first, people forgetting when they last posted, etc.  And would be a more unpleasant experience for the mods to maintain.
