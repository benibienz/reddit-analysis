At the airport shortly after the attacks found a third unexploded bomb. If that together with the other still had exploded, there would arise a huge crater and was the departure completely destroyed. That airport staff informed during an information session, writes Het Laatste Nieuws. Even relief workers caught in this. Earlier, the prosecutor's already said that the third bomb was the toughest.
Why not end the third bomb went off, according to Het Nieuwsblad is due to the fact that the third terrorist (the man with the hat) was blown away by the force of the second explosion. That should be reflected in surveillance images. He would continue to have lying a few seconds and then walked to the street with the panicking crowd. The third bomb was left in the departure hall.

""Shortly after the arrival of the bomb squad detonated the bag by the great instability of the explosives. Luckily no one was hurt here, thanks to the professionalism of the intervening services,"" said federal prosecutor Frédéric Van Leeuw about it afterwards.

According to the federal prosecutor was indeed the intention of the terrorist with the hat to escape. ""We can surmise that he hoped that his bomb would explode due to the shock wave that caused the other bombs. That happened not perfectly."", Sounds in Het Nieuwsblad.",2016-03-26 14:15:30+00:00,d1e5yha,3.0,t1_d1e5sv0,375.0,worldnews

My professor looked for a small area (56km²) to run a complete model and i had to go to the area to start up some measurements. When i talked with the local farmer he told the water could rise very quickly. We didn't expect flash floods happen in the small region and he know places where flash floods had occured recently.

With some pictures we could have a rough estimate how much water the small river had at peak levels. THe problem is that i worked for a private company and they don't allow me to publish the articles. :(

They tried to build fish ponds upstream of rivers making it worse for them. 10 km upstream fro ma big lake they tried to build fish ponds and the water would just evaporate.

When i talked to local farmers they had no clue how to solve it. They wanted a 50.000 water tank connected to the roof of their shack. My optimistic calculations coudn't even fill a 5.000 litre tank.

Rural farmers are screwed one way or another. The population boom, togheter with the shift in rain patterns wil cause a lot of problem for the poor.

Dealing with Police while playing Ingress

As this game involves walking around a lot of public sites, it’s quite possible to run into police, especially if you’re wandering around at night. This guide may help you to stay out of trouble.

It is important to consider the possibility of coming into contact with the police. After all, Ingress calls for a certain type of late night rendezvous with other players or portals. As this game is geared for the techies in our community, not everyone is aware of the game. In addition, there are people that may be aware of it, but do not know your intentions and may call a law enforcement agency to report your suspicious behavior. Below you will find some useful information to help you should you encounter an officer of the law while on your conquest to save humanity one way or another. This is not legal advice, only a suggestion. The author of this document nor the organizations &amp; individuals that post/share this document are not responsible for your actions.

If you are in your vehicle:

    Shut off the engine if it`s running. This will show your intention of not running from them.
    Turn on your interior light. This allows them to see in your vehicle better.
    Do not move after you put your hands on the steering wheel
    Don't reach for your DL or ID, if they want it, they will ask

If you are not in your vehicle:

    Keep your hands out of your pockets. Don't make any sudden movements, and keep your hands down.
    Keep your distance, the officer will move as close as they feel comfortable
    Stay still and don't back up or move around

General things for both situations:

    Explain slowly what you are doing in a light and meaningful manner. Don't be rude, condescending or evasive in your answers.
    Stay calm, and don't worry. If you are not doing anything wrong, you won't be in trouble!
    Comply with all requests and orders. Don't move for your ID or anything until asked. Advise the officer of where it’s at before moving to grab it.
    If you are carrying a firearm, declare it immediately in a polite manner! Also advise the officer if you have a valid CCW Permit on you.

Keep in mind, whoever called you into the police may have embellished your actions to hasten their response time. With that knowledge, it’s expected that the officers responding will have no idea about what is really going on. All they are told is someone is where they normally shouldn't be, and doing something that they are not supposed to be doing. When the officer arrives, s/he will ask a lot of questions to get the story of what is actually taking place - so be patient and answer the questions without getting irritated and upset. Staying calm and not making any sudden movements will keep the tension down between both you and the officers, and prevent anything bad from happening.

It’s also a good idea to familiarize yourself with any local laws and ordinances. Keep in mind, most city and state parks close at dusk - regardless if there is a gate blocking entrance to the parking lot. If someone asks you to leave, comply with the request. If they are an agent of the property you are on, they have the final word. The same rule applies for firearms - they ask you to leave or put it away, you must comply! Here are some local laws and ordinances to familiarize yourself with. This is only a listing to find information and should not be construed as legal advice - always consult your attorney (this applies to the entire document as well).

Title 13 of the Arizona Revised Statutes is the section for the criminal code. The big laws to remember while playing Ingress relate to trespassing and criminal damage (if you damage anything):",2016-01-11 12:57:26+00:00,cytz6pl,1.0,t3_40ewyo,33353.0,pokemongo
