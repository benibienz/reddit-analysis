Trading tip 1) Have patience for the right offer to come ; 2) Put your b/o a key or two higher than what you want so that you get your b/o (unless the item is a very stable one like vanilla knives) ; 3) Don't be a dick even if the other guy is a dick

616,"I dont know who is saying that the ak or m4 should be better than the sg553 or aug. As many others have pointed out, the sg553 is better than the ak in almost every way. Before the patch, everything was perfect with all rifles. Those who want to use ak or m4, use it, those who want to use aug or sg553, use it.  In my opinion, the $300 extra cost doesnt matter much unless the economy of the team is in a tight condition(it doesnt happen much in lower levels like mine, so I dont have as much problem). The problem is that the devs have made a completely unnecessary change and are forcing players to use other guns.They also increased the randomness factor in the gun , thus lowering the skill  ceiling. The devs are sabotaging the performance of ak and m4 so that players use other guns. I'm just GN3 and this patch affects my burst fires, and I dont even flick or react that fast. So obviously it is heavily affecting higher ranked players. **You tell me honestly, in pre patch conditions, could a guy with a sg553 or aug take out somebody using a ak or m4? I'd say definitely.**

 **So yeah, the point is that players should be allowed to use whatever weapon they like. Its not as if the weapons were already shit and we were asking to buff them.**

Trivia- Just before coming to reddit, I played a match in which I used the ssg08. I got 31 kills out of which 27 were with the ssg08. After the match , my friend was like ""Oh wow you're good with the ssg08."" But the thing is that I got so many kills with the ssg08 because most of the time nobody on the enemy team using the ak or m4 managed to get a headshot on me, allowing me to survive. On the other hand, only one guy used the sg553 and most of the times I died, it was a headshot from the sg553",2015-12-11 14:23:41+00:00,cxvbq5r,1.0,t3_3wd80p,8037.0,GlobalOffensive

They come over to a, and I'm happy thinking we'll win the round and I'll be MVP. They come over and start searching for the last guy, but don't plant the bomb. The timer runs out and the CT win.

* Do I change the CPU voltage from manual to adaptive after dialing in and verifying the overclock if I want the power saving options?
