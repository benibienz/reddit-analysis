31,"Basically, it's just the background-image transition being played. It's a bit hard to explain with words, but I'll give it a go:

You're transitioning from the default reddit spritesheet (120 x 923) to your custom icon image (14 x 14).

This transition has two 'parts' to it:

The first 'part' that plays is the spritesheet image fades out (like opacity = 0) and the new custom image fades in (opacity = 1).

Since the images are different sizes, the second 'part' plays:

Initially the 120 x 923 image is out of the bounds of the icon so the transition makes the spritesheet image shrink down to fill the correct 14 x 14 space. So all of the hidden parts of the spritesheet come in to view for a short time before it completeley fades out. The custom image takes the place of the spritesheet so it's initially stretched to fill the 120 x 923 size and shrinks down to its correct size.

If you want to better understand the effect, I recommend testing some simpler cases.",2016-07-24 18:06:05+00:00,d5oydj2,1,t3_4ucu8w,22123,css

42,"I think it has potential. You have kept to a simplistic style using only geometric shapes and your colour palette seems spot on. However, I feel like it's still too complicated, remember this is a launcher icon. You've used too many layers overall. For instance, the bus body consists of two shapes (blue and white) and you've used the blue shape like a border. You've done the same with the window (grey and blue) using the grey like a border. Material design doesn't use borders as a style type. Your design is also missing drop down shadows which is a key part of material design.

The execution was also a little poor with the white edges around the transparency and lack of symmetry and consistent spacing (certain gaps are wider than others). The curving radiuses are also a little off (some wider than others).

I think you've done well with the overall idea and I think it's got nice composition but I think it needs a little more work. Sorry if I've been too harsh.

I agree that the OS is old but I find this unfair to say. Windows 7 has definitely stood the test of time so far and in some aspects actually works better than windows 10, especially for mouse and keyboard users.

For instance Windows 10 is absolutely full of small oversights such as you can't drag and drop shortcuts into the start menu whilst it's open, you must close it first. This is a small annoyance but these annoyances add up and it overall makes the OS less intuitive.

Windows 7 was the product of years of refinement from all of the previous OSs. I mean, the start menu is almost identical to the one from XP but with small improvements, like search.
