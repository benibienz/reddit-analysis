**How they could work**

After finding a mansion, you can hunt down an Evoker and let it summon Vexes. Then after defeating the Evoker, feed a remaing Vex  beetroot. (This will give beetroot another purpose.) This beetroot will turn the Vex red (the colour of beetroot) and it will become friendly and start following you around while attacking for you. If you try to tame a Vex while the Evoker (it's master) is still around, then it will refuse to be tamed. 

Beetroot could become the Vex's favourite food type and could be used to heal your pet. You could also name your Vex using name tags.

**Pros**

* They can phase through blocks so will always keep up with you.
* You can finally take a pet with you when you go caving, without them getting stuck.
* They carry weapons so could fight for you. (You could even give them new weapons, like how zombies work)
* They are small and fly above eye level so will not get in your way.
* Taming them adds more of an incentive to finds mansions, as you can take home a buddy.
* Beetroot is given another purpose, and players would need to start growing beetroot farms if they want to own a Vex.

**Cons**

* It will be hard to tell how much health your pet has. ",minecraftsuggestions,Vex Pets! Be able to tame Vexes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/558lcf/vex_pets_be_able_to_tame_vexes/

Here is a list of some of those features:

* **Seamless rotation in the camera app** - When you rotate the phone whilst using the camera app, it freezes for a second to update the UI. This hasn't always been the case however. Back in ICS days (and perhaps other versions) you were able to rotate the camera app seamlessly. The icons would simply rotate but everything else would stay the same and work smoothly. This feature is still present in the Google Goggles app but was removed from the stock camera app.

* **Calculator History** - Back in the earliest versions of Android you were able to use the trackball on the device to scroll up to see your previous calculations. After the removal of the trackball, this feature was simply lost as Google never put in an alternative way to use this feature.

* **Offline Reading on Websites** - Back when Google announced ICS at Google IO, one of the features announced was the ability to save webpages on your device for offline reading. This feature was never added to Chrome and the 'Browser' app was discontinued so this feature was lost.

* **Lockscreen Widgets** - Another feature lost to time is the ability to set widgets for your lockscreen. You were once able to place widgets on your lockscreen as a way to customise your experience and make tasks easier to access and more efficent but this is no longer the case.

* **Hangouts Widget** - Speaking of widgets, another feature that Google simply removed was the ability to place a Hangouts widget on your homescreen. This feature allowed you to easily glance over all of your contacts at once but was killed off. Unlike the previous features, this wasn't simply forgotten about or replaced with something else but simply removed.

* **White Balance**  - Another feature simply removed was the ability to change the white balance in the Camera app. You were once able to manually set the white balance in the camera app to take better images, but this was removed.",GoogleFeedback,Features Google removed from Android,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleFeedback/comments/4n7i7e/features_google_removed_from_android/
