I KNEW Google was going to be big, and I wanted to invest $1000 in their IPO, but I didn't have the money at the time.  I've done the math, and I would be doing very very well right now.  But you know what?  Nobody knows what the outcome of our choices is going to be.  Getting bogged down with what could have been doesn't leave room for what is now.  Likewise, thinking about the future all the time is the same way.  I can't tell you how to stop living in the past, it could be that you have things to learn from the past that just need time to incubate.  It could be that dwelling on the past is just dragging you down.  Only you can know that.  Prayer and meditation my friend.  When you pray try to be grateful, even when you're suffering.  When you meditate let the past flow through and over you, the future the same, and just be at peace in the now.  You're alive, right now, and that means you have virtually infinite possibilities.  Some people may have a head start in some areas compared to you, but you have the skills and talents that you  have.

It's so easy to judge ourselves when we have goals that we aren't meeting.  Or even realizing that we can't even see how to have goals that take us in the direction we think we want to go.  Giving yourself the grace to go through the process of falling, whether or not you can see or imagine a bottom, is so key, and yet so often misunderstood by the people who love you.  It's unbelievably tough to see someone you love floundering.

7,"Not sure if for me, but rites of passage have been a central part of many if not most cultures for...forever really.   It can be anything, I'm all about the wilderness and outdoors, so a backpacking trip is great for me.   It allows me to take the time to process the change and prepare to take my life in a new direction.   Backpacking is a tall order if you aren't in that culture abbas mindset already but there are a ton of options. 

Take a road trip.  Visit some place or places that you have always wanted to see but haven't yet.   Don't have a ton of money?  Bring blankets or a sleeping bag and sleep in your car.   Bring a friend or meet up with someone meaningful in your life who helped you get where you are. 

Go somewhere new.   If you have the money go to Europe, Africa, Asia.   If money is tight drive to another state, or even just out of your home town to a quiet place away from people.   Take time to mediate on your new direction, or better yet just enjoy your new surroundings.  Let life show you it's beauty. 

Go fishing/hiking/drive/bike.  Whatever gets you away from your day to day routine and allows you time and distance from your current life.   

The key isn't distance, mode of transport, or location.   The key is doing something to celebrate your accomplishment, and to set a memorable and meaningful event at the break between ""then me"" and ""now me"".  ",2016-11-20 05:47:44+00:00,da7w2tq,3.0,t1_da7ttwk,4499.0,GetMotivated

10," It's OK to feel lost right after college, but don't wallow in that. It's important that you find a way to give yourself a rite of passage to commemorate and announce this big life change to yourself, and your subconscious. When I left the military I chose to spend 30 days in the Montana high-country with a group called National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). That 30 days was the difference between me feeling completely lost and drifting to me feeling like I had a plan and was carrying it out. Once that was finished I worked for an outdoor school for a bit before I started college. I just finished my bachelors, only I'm in my middle 30's now. I just realized in writing this that I am feeling like I'm drifting because I haven't given myself a rite of passage for that big change. Looks like it's time to go climb a mountain!

Seriously tho, my rite's of passage are potentially going to be different for me than for you, or you doing what you can be comfortable with. The key is to do SOMETHING MEANINGFUL that gives you a sense of closure on the last 4-5 years of your life. It should honor the extreme effort and commitment that got you through your college years. And really ideally, it should have some relation, in some way either big or small, to your degree. It's just a way to validate your hard work to yourself, your subconscious, or whatever.

For example My NOLS trip was related to my military service because the group teamwork reminded me of what I loved about the military. It also helped me deal with the fact that my actions took peoples lives because I was taking a Wilderness First Responder Course. So in some ways I felt that I was taking steps to order my future around helping people instead of killing them.

28,"Matthew 23:8 But do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.

It's not ""mere happenstance"" that we as believers who search the Scriptures in order to better understand them find truths that have been found and ratified long before our time, yet are new to us.  What you advocate is a dead reliance on the mystical fathers of faith instead of a living relationship with the Most High.  In your doctrine, they and only them had access to the Holy Spirit, by way of distance and time away from our current day.  Where in the Bible do you find an expiration date on the gifts of the Holy Spirit?  

At what point in time (tell me the date) did the Holy Spirit cease to be active in the lives of Christians as was evident in Acts?  How do those who come before us hold a special and unique right to search the Scripture, to be quickened and enlightened by the Holy Spirit?  At what time in history did YHWH change His interaction with man, and turn His authority over to men of a bygone age, for them to ratify His Word, for them and only them to have the key to truth, relegating all that come after to be bystanders, a crowd of onlookers who who must rely on what has been discovered, and forbidden to seek better, more perfect understanding?  Our understanding of our Father has grown through such seeking, through those who had the courage to seek beyond what was preached to be the Truth by doctrine, and to look within Scripture itself, having faith that the Holy Spirit will not give a stone when we ask for bread.

For someone who preached the sanctity and perfection of Scripture to guide and teach us, you more often preach adherence to doctrines of men, looking only to them to guide our relationship with our Father, trusting only them to have the correct answer.  Where in your ""religion"" is there room for the quickening, the life that can come only by the Holy Spirit.  God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.  As all who have come before us live in Christ, so we also live, not simply as observers of a work already completed, but as children of the Most High, called to seek so that we may find, knock that the door be opened to us.  

Is the time of seeking and knocking over, as you profess is the time of prophets?  When did Christ's admonition to us cease to be valid?  Is there a new Law, greater than the fulfillment of the Law by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ?  At what time did we cease to be actors in the Gospel and become only recyclers, regurgitators, eating the leftovers of those who had the faith and the courage to seek God, to reject (as Luther did) the doctrines of men where they had erred?  When did that work of guiding Christians to the Truth transfer from the Holy Spirit to men of a bygone era?  When did our relationship with God cease to be personal?  When did God transfer His authority to the writings of the forefathers, that we can only approach His throne through their liturgy?  

Your belief in education and technical training in lieu of a living, active relationship with God is in direct opposition to the life of Christ.  He called fishermen, not lawyers, experts on the law and the Torah.  He called a tax collector.  He called sinners.  He called men and women whose hearts yearned after Him, after His kingdom, not those whitewashed tombs that relied so heavily on the law, and their expertise that they rejected the Messiah when he was in their midst.  Let us be clear, I do not reject the Athanasian Creed, but I do not consider it Scripture, it is doctrine.  Doctrine based on Scripture, and therefore valuable.  

Yet like any doctrine, if it be found through earnest study, through guidance of the Holy Spirit, clearly and obviously to be in opposition to Scripture, I would abandon it, and not the Scripture.  In the case of the Athanasian Creed, I would not abandon it lightly, for it was produced by centuries of diligent study, it evolved through the true and honest seeking of our forefathers for Truth, for understanding.  However, if by searching, and prayer, and diligent study, and ratified and confirmed by the Holy Spirit in me, and was confirmed by the Law of Love, and yet not a single person agreed with me, I would stand my ground, as did everyone who furthered the Kingdom of God.  For I believe, I have faith, I do not reject the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  

I do not reject a living, breathing, growing, radical relationship with YHWH through the sacrifice and resurrection of Christ, through the Gift, instruction, and quickening of the Holy Spirit.  I believe and attest that we have and are called to act in the Gifts of the Spirit, they are not a thing of a bygone era, they have no expiration date, they are as valid today as at any time in history.  I believe in a Living God, who is capable, to Whom nothing is impossible.  He is able to enlighten the mind to understand the Trinity, He is able to teach, guide, help, heal, free, and resurrect us.  To look upon the Gifts of the Spirit and call it the work of the devil is a dangerous act. 

Matthew 12: 22-37

Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.

23 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?

24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.

25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:

26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?

27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.

28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.

29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.

30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.

31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.

32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.

33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.

34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.

36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.

37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.

Our relationship with God is not a static thing unless we make it that in order to stay comfortable.  Taking risks is what divides those who do great things from those who don't.

30,"Doesn't Lutheran doctrine separate from the Catholic church at Martin Luther?  I'm not disparaging Luther, as a Protestant and seeker of truth I find his actions to be invaluable.   I'm more wondering why you won't look at the text by Augustine, as i am stating that what he wrote in the linked material is exactly what i found, just in a different area of scripture, but with the same result.   Finding a truth like that through my own study and following of the Holy Spirit's guidance is valuable to me. 

As to why?  I believe that part of my faith and relationship with God is defined and strengthened by an active searching out the Truths within His Word.   I have found that by translating the scripture directly from the Hebrew gives me greater depth of understanding, and in turn a greater and deeper relationship with God.   Part of the reason for Luther's reformation was the church reading scripture in latin, a language that most common people didn't speak or understand, was it not.   It seems Luther valued and sought to uphold a Christian's right and duty to search the scripture himself, so I'm not sure why you are so opposed to my sharing what i find.   Especially when is discovered and shared that my personal discovery is validated by Augustine, a Saint who, as i do, holds to the Athanasian Creed.

To be clear, it's not Augustine who agrees with me, it's i who agree with him, he saying in his work much better and more concisely than i have.   However, that doesn't mean that i should hide what treasure and light i have found, but rather that i should share that treasure, being confirmed as true by someone more wise and respected than I.  In addition, i would not hide a discovery within Scripture that is accompanied by the confirmation of the Holy Spirit in me, regardless of your our anyone else's desire that I do so.   If you wish to understand better what i am saying regarding the Trinity, look to Augustine who said it better than I.  ",2016-11-05 07:51:53+00:00,d9mnmu0,8.0,t1_d9mfr0l,18153.0,Christianity

39,"I think what i find most interesting is that i blogged about something i found in scripture direct from scripture with no outside sources.  Yet when it conflicts with your belief, you argue that we must rely on only what we find in Scripture and then referred me to a bunch of books, blogs, and videos to support your assertion.  Then when i responded by showing that what i found was discovered by Augustine, many centuries before i discovered it (separately, I was not aware of Augustine's work), you shift to asserting that Augustine is not perfect so it's unreliable.   

You can't have your supporting documents and reject mine using that argument.  I would think that referencing the scripture of a direct translation of Genesis 1:2 from Hebrew to English using established vernacular would qualify as""direct from scripture"", but it appears that rule only applies as long as it agrees with the (extra scriptural) doctrine that you believe. 

I did some research on the books you suggested, and my conclusion is that it doesn't make sense to believe that the first century Christians performed miracles through the Holy Spirit, but that somehow that doesn't apply to us today.   I believe that there is too great if a divide between my experience and belief concerning the actions and gifts of the spirit, and yours is too incompatible for us to find agreement on this subject.   

It appears to me that the Lutheran doctrine regarding these scriptures does not agree with any reading of scripture that i can accept, so in the interest of love i would suggest that we agree to disagree on this point, and agree that we have in common love and faith in Yeshua Christ, YHWH, and the Holy Spirit.  I would urge you to consider how much of your belief and faith relies on denominational texts, and whether your loyalty to Lutheran doctrine may be getting in your way here.

I'm going to strike out the analogy, it's not supposed to be there, and the Holy Spirit has convicted me that I put that in, apart from Him.  I realized it when I started writing it, but for some reason I felt it was needed.  The truth is that the Holy Spirit is willing and able to speak the truth into the readers mind and heart, it's not my place to try to explain what that passage means.  I only know what I understand it to mean, and honestly I'm not sure there's a really Truthful accurate way to explain that.  My only other addendum would be to ask, is your position that the Trinity is a mystery beyond human ability to comprehend based on the scripture?  I believe that YHWH can reveal mysteries to us, and that the revelation of mysteries is part of the approach of His return.

59,"Let me see if i can add to this discussion. 

Hell is a place according to Yeshua.  

Yeshua also states that the generation of that day would not perish until he came back.  

An explanation of this is given in the parable with the workers in a field.  Some work all day for a denarius.  Some work half a day for a denarius.  Some work the end of the day for a denarius.  All of them remain in the field from the time they start till the end of the day and get paid the same wage. 

The day is this age. 

It would appear that Christ is telling us that no matter the length of the day, no one will ""leave the fields"" i.e. perish from his death to his second coming. 

Yet His second coming has not yet happened.   So are we talking reincarnation/rebirth with numerous chances/lifetimes for people to come to Christ?

I believe Christ points us to this. 

Yeshua said that it's not YHWH's will that ANY perish, so how can any perish?

Christ's resurrection proved His power over sin and death.   Throughout the new testament He no longer refers to people's deaths as anything more than ""sleeping"".  So death then is a more permanent spiritual death, not what we think of as death.   

More importantly, from my viewpoint, how could Christ's death and resurrection be considered to be a victory if 99% of everyone who has ever lived ends up in hell anyway?

There is no doctrine that's backs this idea up, only an open-minded, searching reading of the bible. ",2016-10-28 04:52:47+00:00,d9b1u6d,1.0,t3_59rmjz,15008.0,Christianity

Anyway, I just wanted to come here to let you know that I appreciated your well thought-out and well-written statement, and to encourage you.  Your mods are in my top 5, and your NCR Ranger Armor inspired me to make my own Hunting Revolver, Lucky, and Weathered Ranger Sequoia once the .45-70 became available with Far Harbor.  

Thanks for speaking out, thanks for creating awesome stuff, and thanks for inspiring me to become a mod author myself.  ",2016-06-07 11:31:27+00:00,d3zb8f8,1.0,t3_4mq4ao,128449.0,FalloutMods

195,"As one of the authors who very vocally pulled my mods and urged others to do so, I just want to say I feel your pain.  I don't want my mods to be down any more than you do.  I'm not a very well known mod author, and to be honest I realize I'm taking the risk of pissing off the few people who are using my mod.  That being said, I totally stand by my decision to hide my mods.  It comes down to several factors: Intellectual property rights, a desire to not see Bethesda.net turn into a junkyard of ""Test_garbage_mod"" files with no mod images or documentation, and finally plain old respect. 

I'm not even one of the authors who had mods stolen from me!  I believe that every one of us who have authored mods have a responsibility to stand-up and stand-for the authors whose mods have been stolen.  If I'm not willing to stand up for my fellow authors, who's going to stand up for me if/when my mods are stolen?  

At the end of the day, I'm sorry you're being inconvenienced, and I get it, 99% of mod users are paying the price for the 1% that are ruining it for everyone.  But also remember, that 1% is ruining it for me too, because I made a mod in order to share it, not hide it away all for myself.  So if keeping my mod hidden for a week or two helps get this whole situation can be ironed out, then I hope you can be understanding and patient, knowing that we're fighting to make sure that the modding community doesn't turn into a pirating free-for-all, or worse, losing a lot of talented mod authors who would rather not put their efforts into something that will be disrespected by pirates.  

I'm committed to seeing mods work successfully on consoles, just like I'm committed to putting my best work on the nexus for PC users.  If we don't stand up for what's right at the beginning of this thing, then we will just be looking at an ugly future, which could very well be the end of many of your favorite mod authors, and that would be a shame.

I'm going to get down off my soap-box now, but I hope that I've given you a reason to think about how dealing with some inconvenience now will (hopefully) lead to a future where modders can create with confidence that their work won't be stolen, and users can have a mod resource that is usable and not a cluster.",2016-06-06 21:33:40+00:00,d3ylyvk,1.0,t3_4mt2n8,26879.0,FalloutMods

You simply create whatever component you want (for example mod_44_LuckyGrips) in the CK.  Then on that item you place a bActorValue with the sub property of ADD and then whatever legendary modifier you want.  Then head over to FO4Edit and build your weapon.  If you want to make a .44 legendary component you would copy as override a .44 into a new file.  Then in the component A section where you find the grip you change that to your legendary grip.  Give the weapon a special name, etc etc. At that point you save your .esp and you have a vanilla .44 with a legendary modified grip on it.  

Now you can go in-game, console command your weapon to you, and then you'll be able to remove the grip at a workbench and install it on any .44, legendary or otherwise.

Now if you want to make it a viable mod in your game, go back into the CK and input ""vendor"" in the search bar.  Now pick your vendor inventory (it's denoted by a black circle thingy), open it up, add new and add your custom weapon.  Now you can buy the weapon from a vendor.  Same thing applies if you want to put it in an existing chest.  Just find the chest in the world, right-click to open it and then place your weapon in there.

I did find that there is a setting for Binoculars in the zoom settings for scopes, but when I attached that zoom setting to an invisible scoped weapon it returned a circular scope reticle, so I'm thinking I may have to actually model a pair of binoculars to create the correct view.

The mechanic is already there in game if you play through the entire rail road quest line to take down the prydwin,  speechchecks and all.

2) create a mission to retake quincy with preston followed by some closure for the longs.   Preston should at least have something worthwhile to say when you take care of Clint and Co. 

3) unique npcs who proc in your settlements and have unique quests at a certain population limit.  Unique dialogue and personalities would be huge in the settlement system and would add more depth to the game. 

4)  a peaceful option in lieu of killing the railroad or BOS depending on your playthrough.  Speech check required!  

5)  a way to peacefully interact with the Raiders at easy city downs.  Maybe some betting and a robo-racer you can build yourself! 

6)  peaceful entry to the combat zone.   Even allow for you to fight raiders in the ring! 

7)  disguises like in FONV. Dress like a raider?  Don't get attacked.   Same for gunners, children of Atom,  and scavengers!

8)  allow me to buy the colonial taphouse and staff it if Henry dies. 

That's all I have atm but I'm sure there are many other areas that could benefit from some rescripting.

434,"I have been playing in this style as much as possible, survival, not saving, etc.  I just started a new character to try to hash some of these things out.  Here are my thoughts so for: Plan of attack, a sneaky sniper is going to be the best build in terms of staying alive.  You can sneak in power armor, so it's likely that having a t-45 or better suit around for when you really need it will be a good idea.  

pipe weapons will be your friends early on.  higher damage output means a scoped, modded .38 will no longer be a bad weapon.  

6 charisma is going to be required no matter how you build.  Having local leader will mean the difference between having the materials you need to build strong settlements or not, and you'll need settlements for food, water, and protection.  

Spending some time in the northern part of the map establishing settlements, gaining xp, and getting some lower level weapons is going to be almost a requirement before you venture out further.  

Building in your settlements is a great way to get ""free"" xp, allowing you to build some of the perks you will need before you can venture out for some of the better weapons.

Once i have built a character that I think can survive the journey I will be making a bee-line for the railroad.  2 OP weapons and early access to ballistic weave will be the biggest advantages you can give yourself early in the game.  If you have the caps make a stop by vault 81 and pick up the overseers suite of armor and weapon.  You know why.  

Now there are two options.  
1) Go to the Brotherhood and do a whole bunch of quests to unlock vertibird travel
2) Kill that bastard Kellogg and get your ass into the Institute, giving yourself instant teleportation travel.  This is probably the fastest way to get fast travel back.  

After either of those two options, play out the story as you see fit!

Notes:
I've found that currently waiting in a chair gives you an autosave.  If you can't find a bed and are about to get in a fight this might be an option, depending on if Bethesda takes it out or not. 

Getting companion perks early will make your character stronger, so I probably won't be traveling with Dogmeat much in the early game.  

The absence of autosave will make lootlocking basically impossible, but I'm sure people will find areas that can still be exploited.  These areas will be gold, and should be exploited as early as possible to give you an extra edge.

Reba II is a fairly easy to get sniper rifle right off the bat, it's in the north so arguably less dangerous weapon to get, especially if you're sneaky.  The other way to go would be to join the Railroad as quickly as possible to get the Deliverer and Tinker Tom's special, as well as ballistic weave as early in the game as possible.  This combo right here will maximize your survival for the remainder of the game.  The reason Charisma is going to be so important in the new survival is because you're going to need settlements because you are going to need food and water, as well as safe places to hunker down and sleep/retreat to when you find yourself overmatched.  Straight out of the vault, put some points towards gun nut so you can put a scope on the pipe guns or a lucky hunting rifle that you may come across to keep distance between yourself and all those things trying to kill you.  some points toward armorer early will help you too.

Why not complete that story?

A good weapon to pick up in a fight where you need decent rof is a .308 semiautomatic combat rifle.   Scoped is better but without a scope it's still deadly, and the rof allows for a lot of staggering with the right perks.   Gunners drop them a lot so you don't need to bring one with you, just loot and shoot! 

You mentioned 2 things I thought were interesting,  not liking the combat rifle because you get rushed,  and not using mines.   Try laying down some bottlecap mines, backing up and unloading with an unsilenced. 308 combat rifle.   Use getting rushed to your advantage!  Instant win, and really fun. 

I do agree, the plasma rifle ammo is too uncommon to be useful for a prolonged run.  I found a 2 shot plasma gun,  used it for a mission, ran out of ammo and have stored it.  It's a fun weapon, just not super practical. ",2016-02-25 16:36:30+00:00,d0de2le,1.0,t3_47g9me,56651.0,fo4

However, I did find almost all the settlements before I went to the Institute, and Preston has never asked me to take down the BOS.
