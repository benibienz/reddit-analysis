Warning, the information there is extremely disturbing, NSFW/NSFL and should also be read and researched with an extremely critical mind. 

I'm politically moderate, more left leaning socially, and not someone who tends to get caught up in the conspiracy theory crowd.   That being said, i have been following this, and believe there is enough circumstantial evidence that i think this stuff is most likely true. 

That being said, I'm struggling with anger, and trying to see God's sovereignty when this kind of abuse is allowed to go on (possibly for many years now) unchecked.   I'm trying to figure out what our role as Christians is in this, and how these children could be so unprotected despite the power and love of God.   

I know the world is a messed up place, and that sin is the reason that this kind of thing happens all over the world.   I guess i am struggling with this specifically because it's so raw, new, and shocking, and it seems to go so deep in our country.   I'm having a crisis in terms of America's role in the world.   How can we as  a nation that is blessed by God expect His blessing to continue when our leaders can be this depraved.   

I hope someone can help me put this in perspective.   I'm feeling pretty raw and hopeless right now

I've just had a horrible thought.   What if it's the other way around.   Trump against a litteral monster.   They had to know we were going to find the podesta info, and the pedo code words aren't really very clever, actually incredibly overt once someone gets the first hint.

All the bans, totally obvious, actually sparked more searching, discussion and outrage.   The cannibal hillary isn't going to survive long enough to serve even one term, she's in stage three, months to a year at most to live.   Why would she even run if she's truly about to die?  Are we all suckers??  

Is Trump the real antichrist, ran against a dieing, outed satanic, child destroying, cannibal monster?  Hasn't trump taken a ride on the ""Lolita express"" too?  

Here's my litmus test: if hillary isn't brought up on charges, along with podesta and all the rest, we're still screwed in a system rigged so that we couldn't win from the start, and it's just more of the same morally sick people (demons) running this country to hell.

I hope that we can all be mature and realize that not everyone on PC and not everyone on a console is stupid, or a prick, or whatever.  I guess I just want to get on here and say that I have mods that are currently hidden both on Bethesda.net and on the nexus, and I've had nothing but support and appreciation from everyone who has messaged me.  

The possibility to mod for XBox (and soon PS4) is really exciting, because it's new, and people are excited to try it out.  I've had one dude who was an asshat, and that was on r/falloutmods.  He was crying because I pulled my mods and urged others to do so.

So out of the 1000+ people who downloaded my mods, one dude (who maybe didn't even download my mod) was being a prick.  Everyone else, regardless of platform, has been cool as crackers.  

So I guess I just want to say, thanks to everyone who's being understanding and appreciative, I don't care what platform you use.  And yea, EVERYONE is suffering right now because a few jackasses decided to be jackasses.  I don't get to share my mods, you don't get to play my mods.  Do you know who I'm frustrated with?  The pirates, yes a little.  At the the end of the day though, I'm disappointed with how Bethesda has handled this whole thing.   

So, what do you say we work together, cross platform to make the community better, and not divided.  I'm guessing that a lot of people who never knew that the nexus existed now do know about it.  So lets do a little grass-roots self-moderation.  Xbox folks, take a moment to make sure you're downloading mods that are legit by taking a quick look over on the nexus.  PC folks, lets help spread the ""rulz and expectations"" so that we can all be on the same page.  

I don't know, I'm just rambling at this point, but it just sickens me to see something as awesome and groundbreaking as mods to consoles has created so much toxicity.  The people who want to do the right thing FAR outnumber the thieves and trolls, so lets work together dammit, and not get all caught up in the console vs. PC nonsense.  We're all just people who like to play vidya games.

followed it to the download [page:] (https://github.com/niftools/max_nif_plugin/releases) 

downloaded all 3 files in .zip format. I extracted them to my desktop using 7zip.

Turns out that simply causes you to look through a normal scope,  not binoculars.   

Next I looked at the textures and meshes associated with the binoculars from FONV, and it seems to me that FONV just uses a texture overlay on the screen to simulate binoculars.   FO4 on the other hand seems to have the player actually look down a 3D scope mesh.

Retaking of quincy would allow for adding another unique city with characters who could add more than farming another gunner site for armor, adding depth and more playability to the game.

All those cities in skyrim were essentially replaced by player built settlements in fo4.  In skyrim the cities were an almost endless source of stories, unique characters, and quests.   In fo4 we get 4 factions and diamond city but that's pretty much it other than dungeon diving.   I would love to see Beth or talented modders patch in 1 or 2 or more!! unique NPCs local to each settlement. These characters could add the flavor that is honestly missing from player settlements like dialogue, quests, stories, etc.   In skyrim every city has a huge number of these unique characters, and that's why that game seems so much more vast in comparison!
