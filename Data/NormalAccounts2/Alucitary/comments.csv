Considering people who still frequent this sub are probably the top 1% of the top 1% I suppose I could see how they would all already have all the gear at that point, but for me it was a godsend. I could log on anytime, and have an endless font of stuff to do, a majority of which was my favorite thing, the raids. It was also the conclusion of my Gjallarhorn hunt, and finally being able to conquer all of the year 1 content while it was still relevant was a tremendous send off.

1,"I can agree that Fallout is a really interesting world, but unless Tamriel is the first fantasy world you have ever seen then I have a hard time believing anyone could be legitimately interested in the lore of Elder Scrolls let alone the characters. (does Elder Scrolls even have characters?) and just because the hacker group concept has been done before dosnt mean it is untouchable. Mr. Robot, and GTA themselves are derivative of older material as well. Literally all forms of art draw inspiration from what came before it. WD2 is pretty unique even considering that, I'm enjoying the story of WD2 because it is lighthearted and fun unlike most other underground hacker stories like Mr.Robot.

Also lets not pretend that the gameplay loops of Bethesda games aren't also predictable and formulaic. You walk into a town for the first time, get bombarded with 50 people telling you their problems while their scripting struggles to hold together, they send you out to crawl through a cave that has loose story elements sprinkled throughout it, and at the end you find a shortcut that loops back around to the beginning. Repeat until you get bored and quit. 

The only reason people give Bethesda a pass on their generic gamplay loops are because their games only come out ever few years, and people are willing to come back to it. Similarly for me I don't play ever Ubisoft game that comes out like most of the people that seem to hate on them. You aren't forced to play all of their games.

Do they stick to a formula for their gameplay? Yes

Do they crank them out too fast, and let a few too many bugs through? Yes

Does Bethesda take three times as long to make their games and still produce games that are even more broken than Ubi's? subjective, but I would argue yes.

Do they make a shit ton of money from people that buy the same game with slight improvements year to year? Yes

Does any of this invalidate either companies games from being legitimately entertaining, and enjoyable? No, so what are we even arguing about? ",2016-11-16 20:10:03+00:00,da36zyr,4,t1_da31vbr,6192,PS4

Back in the day when she started streaming as Cosmo she was exactly as weird as she is now, talking a million miles a minute, was extremely narcasistic, and made fun of people in her chat for not knowing the most minute detail about the obscure game she was playing. 

Over time I think she managed to gain control over the anxiety stuff, and became a very competent streamer, even got a normal girlfriend, helped to start a business in SRL, and became a huge pillar of the community. with the loss of her viewership I bet she has became extremely isolated by comparison.

People simply play better in teams, and when you match into a game against team of 6 with all randoms 9/10 times the outcome is already decided. Maybe the skill rating of everyone on the enemy team is equal to all of the ratings of the people on your team, but in a group they will play better than their rank if they ever play solo. And matchmaking does this a lot. They will put large teams against teams of all randoms, and several teams of 2 or 3 on a single team against a team of all randoms.

Nuclear reactors usually have to deal with shoestring budgets from private investors because the politicians will always refuse to be associated with anything with the term nuclear on the label. This in tern leads to more internal issues, which leads to an even more situations that damage the image of the field. It's a vicious cycle that only started because of ignorant politicians and voters who refuse to ever look at the actual mechanics of nuclear power and simply associate it with atomic bombs for no reason.

It does suck that the dev made a false statement about the game, but to be fair it was made in off the cuff interviews done months before the games release, and even then it by no means ruins the experience. The other main complaint is the repetition which at this point is hard to take seriously considering how much still lies between a majority of players and the end of the game. Most people I see levying this criticism cite that they have gone to 30-50 worlds and have gotten bored by the repetition, when in the grand scheme of things they have barely scratched the surface. NMS is a slow burn, it is not meant to be played like an action shooter where you get a cool new setpeice every hour.

142,"His play now relies strongly on headshots, if you arent good at them then he is mostly useless, if you are good at them then he is godly. At mid range getting good shots on key targets like Pharah, Mercy, Lucio and Zenyattas is very easy and you can focus them down quickly with good shooting. The key is to find that comfortable range and stick to it while staying protected and avoiding getting singled out. If you do get chased or you want to push he can still be effective though, his flashbang combo is much less effective after the nerf, but it still gets the job done on pretty much anyone except for a few tanks. 

A key to doing good at close range is being able to read your opponent health quickly. If you stun a Reaper for instance and you see that he has half health, dont bother fanning the hammer, just headshot him to keep him from potentially getting out of stun and getting you. Also on even squishier heroes like Tracer, and Zenyatta a simple headshot is all it takes to kill them so fan the hammer is completely unnecessary.

His ult is only good when you are flanking most of the time, even then don't expect to get that many kills. sometimes just swatting one bothersome Pharrah with it quickly can be a huge help to your team. Like pretty much all the offensive heroes the ult isn't meant to be a game changer they are meant to be solid all rounder characters that can make small, but effective pushes with their ults.",2016-06-26 10:45:24+00:00,d4ohucg,1,t3_4px7v6,890,Overwatch

Also you neglect her out of suit form which technically makes her better at surviving massive damage surges better than any tank.

Also since her health is virtually all shield she heals 50% faster paired with a mercy she is virtually unstoppable.

Finally her ult which isn't even supposed to be a massive team clearing attack (unless paired with a Zarya ult or launched skillfully into the air) works very well for scattering a team off an objective to buy your team some extra time to get back. Either way much better than Winston's ult.

There is no easy way to stop people from bullying or laughing at people who are diffent. It is a systemic problem that has always existed in society, it may even be in our genes, Hiding it away does not do anything. All we can do is condemn it and try to raise the bar.

352,"As far as specifics go here is my setup.

Bladedancer with Bones of Eao, crouch invis, and escape artist all the way through.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abyss - MIDA/Sniper

Make the run being smart with crouching and melees. Easy.

Bridge - Whatever you want

Kill swordbearer, jump the bridge (do not jump for distance, especially on bladedancer, hit jump right before you drop out of apex) hide on right side, and snipe.

Thrallway - Sleeper Simulant

Sleeper can kill closed shriekers if you don't know. Start at entrance, shoot first shrieker, escape artist melee closest thrall, run to invisible wall, sleeper shot the second and run to pit (or doors if you want the loot)

Deathsinger - Sleeper Simulant

Just run into the side rooms, kill the shriekers, run back to towers, kill wizard, and kill ads until Litergy starts. Go invis, run into crystal room, and 2 shot Deathsinger with the Sleeper. Get out and kill ads from a safe distance (don't get impacient)

Crota - Raze Lighter

Watch Crota, crouch as soon as he puts his sword down. you will go invis as soon as the doors open. Run to center, and R2 swordbearer. Grab sword and go invis on central platform and jump up to crota. 

On normal mode this part is fairly easy once you have done it a few times. drop sword in center of altar, R2 with sword, and immediately grab sword (can be glitchy, you will get used to it.) Slam 3 times, and melee for invis. R2 again once Crotas invincibility wears off, and get last 3 slams.

On hard mode this is the hardest part of the run because Boomers will destroy you. I like to do 2 slams of first sword, and then run to bottom right room. You will probobly be almost dead. If you have a life support primary use that, if not switch your class perk to hungering blade just to get your health back, and then switch back before Crota goes back to center.

On the second sword get your first 2 slams, invis melee, and then jump like hell. Don't fall off the platform, but stay away from Crota and the ground. With luck you will have about 1/3 of health left and will be able to get the last 2 slams.

The darkness zone is my main concern right now though. i like the player concentration right now, but like you said it leads to some serious lack of NPCs to fight. I'm afraid with the full map unlocked this will invert however. NPCs will be plentiful, but player encounters will be greatly diminished. I definitely don't want that.

The bullet sponge enmeies are alos a design aspect that will be really hard to deal with, and it will be interesting to see how they plan to evolve encounters in the end game.

My advice is to not focus too much on extractions unless you got a really good blue item, do you really want to die for a handful of greens you are just going to sell anyways? And when you do get something worth extracting for gods sake don't stand directly on the helipad, hell don't even stand in on the same block in most cases.

3. Run Court of Oryx as much as possible. It is really confusing at first, but it is the best method of making your way to light 290. (side note always keep your light as high as possible while doing this because the quailty of drops and decryptions are based on your current light level.)

1. Crossroads. - The mancannons and disconnected points on Control feel incredibly fluid. My favorite map of all Destiny maps by far.

2. Ghost ship - Great mix of close quarter, and long sight lines that accommodates all play styles, but allows them to also be countered if you aren't paying attention.

3. Bannerfall - In large part because of the cool factor of being set in the tower, but also a solid map overall.

4. Frontier - Pretty average feels almost like a classic map.

5. Exile - Every corner of the map has a distinct feel, and good for all play styles. A little too cramped when it comes down to it though.

6. Vertigo - Amazing setting, but the sight lines are all blocked off making sniping anywhere but the edge of the map nearly impossible. (also it is cancer on Rift.)

7. Sector 618 - a little too much platforming for me, but the solid battle arenas are fun enough to navigate.

8. Memento - This will probably change as I grow more accustom to it, but I agree with op. Feels way too busy, and objectives are very frustrating. Fun with rumble, but not much else.",2015-09-10 02:34:45+00:00,cuwcpoz,1,t3_3kc2sp,2087,DestinyTheGame

If you want to get a perfect roll on a Swordbreaker type shotgun get the Dry Rot 32 (drops from Dragon Stikes) has basically the same stats, can be rerolled, and you don't have to run Crota's End over and over to get it.

As for Rockets I would say still stick with the Ash Factory. Generally the only stat that matters on a rocket launcher is the blast radius stat which is maxed out for Ash. All the other stats make a very negligible difference. If you want a good middle ground try to get The Dreamwaker from the Prison of Elders big chest.

Be aware that everyone is always watching their minimap. If you are aware of them then they are aware of you, and you can use that to your advantage. 

What I tend do is head toward an area where I know the enemy is concentrated, and approach them until I am around the corner from them or through a wall. When the radar goes from outlined to filled I immediately back off because they will definitely have recognized you by then. At this point simply keep backpedaling, and wait for them to come rushing around the corner with a shotgun. Two shots to the head, and repeat.

Of course the actual execution varies a lot depending on the tide of the battle, but the bottom line is to be aware of your opponent, play defensively 90% of the time, and know the maps like the back of your hand.",2015-07-20 19:16:37+00:00,cta0ktw,4,t1_cta04ik,695,DestinyTheGame
