The ability to shutdown as many healthpacks as you want for your enemy's is insanely strong for a defense sided Sombra. They tried to balance it by only allowing her to hack them after the match starts, and having a small cool down for hacking, but I feel like it still isn't enough because usually by the time the attacking team starts to break through the main choke she has most if not all of the point centric health packs already converted. 

This is just insane. Health packs are a huge part of the game, and giving a single character the ability to completely eliminate them for the opposition is kind of already making her a guaranteed pick. 

On top of this the time that it takes for the health pack to go back to normal is insanely long at 1 full minute, AKA 20% of the starting time on most maps. I don't find the rest of her kit at all OP like most people were afraid of, but for me this one aspect of her character seems a  bit broken. Maybe decreasing the capture time, or limiting the hack to just 1 health pack would make it better.

For me his abilities are just over the edge of what I would personally do. 

* Wraith form allows him to instantly negate any ultimate, and optimize his own ultimate without any preparation or team coordination. I feel like this ability should have a shorter length, and you also probably shouldn't be able to pick up health while in that form. I feel like it should be less about attacking and more about extraction basically.

* Shadowstep is very situational and a perfect option for breaking blockades. This is probably what the character was built around in addition to shotgunning and it shows. Keep it.

* The shotguns are powerful. I'm not gonna say too powerful because saying that they should nerf his damage is dumb and there are so many more interesting ways to balance characters. He can destroy any tank in about 2 seconds. As a Reinhardt main I'm not happy about it, but I realize why it is the case.

* Death Blossom is a great ult, but because of Wraith Forms focus, and the fact that it is play of the game 25% of the time, it is often seen as an ult that requires 0 skill. It plays in perfectly to his  playstyle and would work fine if he couldn't just lead his teams charge with it head on.

* The Reaping passive is probably one of my biggest complaints. Reaper already possesses 50 more HP over his other offensive brethren so why give him the ability to heal in the battlefield as well? the answer is that in theory Reaper should be separated from his team/healer, behind enemy lines, but as stated before this is a non issue. Either he can simply Wraith Form into one of the enemies health station, defended or not, and heal up that way or Wraith form through the enemy team to his healer. Obviously on it's own this passive is really no big deal, but it is indicative of the problem that I have with Reaper, that he has so many options in addition to being incredibly powerful on point. (in a game where every objective is a single point.)

Again, I'm not saying that he is unbalanced or even that I want him to be nerfed, but I feel like he is being left out of discussion for some reason. Also I can already hear the people saying ""He is literally never used in pro games"" which is because the meta in those games are always about controlling multiple chokes, and require high mobility which reaper obviously does not have. Just thought I would add that in.

Vale is fucked, that is becomeing increasingly more apparent, any hope that the crew might end up back at Beacon next Volume has pretty much gone out the window. The city is destroyed, the teachers are barely holding it together, and Ozpin may be about to make his last stand. So what happens to the students in the aftermath? In the spirit of the vital festival all current students of Beacon are permitted to transfer to whichever school they wish to complete their education.

The catch is that every member of team RWBY is currently headed in different directions and they will not be going to the same academies. Weiss will likely now seek more training from her sister to complete her now unlocked summoning ability, Yang will probobly end up going with her to Atlas to get a new shiny robot arm, and maybe train under Ironwood. Blake will no doubt travel to Vacuo where support for the White Fang is known to be the highest to try to find leads to strike back against Adam. Ruby could probably end up anywhere, but I bet that she will go to Mistral to find out more clues about Cinder's motives (because that is where Cinder and her crew said they came from to sneak into the festival.)

I can't imagine the school setting will hold out much longer, I can see the schools themselves playing a much lesser role in the story as the characters take on more focused disciplines and teachers. This would also be a good opportunity to flesh out the world more by finally getting the crew out of Vale.

The perk had it's time in the sun with the Crota fight for sure, but we don't shoot at massive mobile targets on the other side of gigantic rooms anymore so what exactly is the utility of it? In fact most of the time it can even work to hinder you. If an enemy hides behind cover suddenly, rather than hitting the ground right next to them, and killing them the rocket will veer into the obstacle itself and do no damage.

Basically with the close quarters environments that we are now forced to contend with I feel like Cluster bombs are much more effective at taking care crowds of units, and proximity bomb are still good if you want to maintain accuracy at slightly longer ranges.
