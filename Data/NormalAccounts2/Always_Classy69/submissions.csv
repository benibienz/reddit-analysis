It all started one fateful morning while I was driving little Jefferey to school. I feel comfortable playing the show around my children at this point. Opie had his usual cast of characters on (Sherrod, Vic, Distefano) and they were having a PG-rated good time. All of sudden in my rear-view mirror I see lil' jeffy start rapidly convulsing. He had never gone into a seizure before and I was terrified. I pulled my Caravan to the side of the road and rushed to him. Fortunately the seizure subsided and he was okay, albeit it a little subdued. I took him to the hospital and the doctor couldn't understand why he had the episode.


Fast forward two days. I turn on the radio to get my daily dose of the Opester. Vic Henley is back on the program. Opie delivers a classic zinger, and Vic goes into a laughing frenzy. I plug my ears and try and wait out the white noise. I turn beside me and Jefferey is convulsing on the couch! The only common denominator I could surmise was Vic Henley. But it was far too irrational to be true.


Another two days pass and I'm fixing Jefferey a sandwich in the kitchen. My wife usually would, but I beat her so badly the night before her hands were too swollen! Whoops! Anyways, the radio is on and Vic breaks out into that atrocious high pitched donkey squeal of his. Jefferey falls to the floor and his eyes roll back. This confirmed it. Vic was the cause.

I immediately reached out to Sirius XM. They told me there was nothing they could do. I contacted the Opester but he was too preoccupied with shaming Harambe Jones. I reluctantly called Vic, for the sake of my boy. I explained the situation, and he was extremely polite and apologetic. I was so thankful for his understanding. He told me to wish Jeff the best of luck and that he would tone down his laugh on O&amp;J from now on. I expressed my gratitude and how much his sympathy means to my family.



Then that night I get a call. It's ""Tommy"", a weak attempt at a boys voice asking to speak to Jeff. I was a bit hesitant, but assumed it was probably just one of those fucking anti-social kids in his grade that I teach Jeff to beat the shit out of. I hand him the phone, and not 5 seconds later he drops the phone and begins convulsing! When he snaps back to normal, he told me it was Vic and that he had been aggressively laughing! That sick bastard!



My life has been a nightmare ever since. He has broken into my home, visited Jefferey's school and his football practice. Vic Henley is a menace to society and a MONSTER. I have alerted the police but they laugh and brush it off. They don't think such a docile, lesbian looking man is capable of such cruelty to children. The doctor has informed me that if this continues, Jefferey has about 4 months to live. My little boy is dying and it's all because of Vic. Ever wonder why Vic seems to laugh more and more every appearance? Why it seems to be louder and more annoying every time? I ask you all to unite behind parents like myself and Linda Springwood, who are personally suffering by the hands of the O&amp;J program and the monsters associated with it",opieandanthony,Vic Henley's Laugh is Slowly Murdering My Child,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/51pgw1/vic_henleys_laugh_is_slowly_murdering_my_child/

PEW PEW PEW! He was pointing his finger guns, and guess what? They were aimed right at you.  Greggory captivated the heart of MILLIONS of people across the globe everyday when he'd go on a classic comedic tangent. Face-to-face with some of the top comics in the world, he would stand tall every time and show listeners why he's been in the bizzz for 22 fawkin' years! ""FUNNIEST MAN ON THE PLANET"" cried Bill Burr after leaving the studio following his first appearance on the show. Opie wasn't just a household name, he was a LEGEND. 





Then came the fall from grace. Opie woke up one morning and he had sprouted a pair of breasts. In a panic, he barely heard his wife passionately screaming. He turned over to see his wife, right beside him, being rammed by Bam Margera. Opie jumped out of bed, threw on the nearest grey long sleeve shirt he could find, hopped into his Kia Soul, and rushed to the studio. He mumbled incoherent nonsense to his coworkers as he made his way to the microphone. Suddenly he couldn't form a sentence. Not only that, he had developed this weird habit of burping every fifteen seconds. Looking into the front facing camera of his phone to fix his makeup (he was OBVIOUSLY in a rush), he was shocked to see he was about 25 pounds heavier than he had thought, and was clinging on to the few dozen strands of hair he had left.





""DASSABESSDO"" he heard faintly down the hall. ""DASSABESSDO JUST FUCKNN N CHCILL NNN FUCKK"" was being repeated by some rambling buffoon as he slowly approached the studio doors. It was chilling, and only got louder and louder, becoming more menacing with each guttural cry. Opie was paralyzed in fear. As the door handle turned, a dark, hippo-like figure appeared with a tongue protruding from it's mouth like none he had ever seen. ""JUST A CHILLLLL NNNN FUCKIN'EM"" it approached Opie smiling. ""HARRIET TUBMAN SUM BITCH"". He was no longer living in a delusional world. Gregg was finally self-aware, and he knew at that time, he was living in a nightmare.
