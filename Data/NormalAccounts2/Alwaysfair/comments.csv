I understand how austerity works, however I fail to see a politically acceptable alternative in an environment of low global growth.

Now I know some people like to argue that you could simply grow out of this debt, but they simply can't have done the maths or they refuse to acknowledge that it doesn't work. Take the UK, it came of WW2 with 240% debt to GDP, it only manged to reduce that debt burden to a suitable amount because it had 8% growth per year, the same growth rates as China has today. UK growth today is 2%, the fastest annual growth we have had in 2 decades is 3.8% back in 2000.

Austerity did have an impact I agree, that is part and parcel of the policy, austerity is not designed to produced growth, it is designed to rein in fiscal deficits. Honestly I think discussion on the topic is almost a moot point given that our largest trading partner (EU) is still yet to recover, so stimulus might well have simply prolonged the inevitable slump. Less austerity might well have led to faster growth, but sufficient to lower debt to gdp, seems unlikely given low global growth.

 With regard to crisis I would also add that there is yet another one brewing, that of German exports. Since the 2008 and european stagnation we have seen more and more of Germany's exports heading to both the USA and UK, since 2008 the percentage of exports to France have fallen from just under 10% of total to almost 8%, Italy 6.5% to 4.5%, while the USA has gone from 6.5% in 2008 to almost 10% today and the UK remaing steady at 6.5%. If the USA has even a minor recession Germany will suffer, the same is true for the UK, but by an order of magnitude less.  The reason why this is so dangerous for the EU is that despite europe's problems since 2008 the German economy and employment has remained strong, Germany could relax slightly about its domestic affairs and concentrate on holding the EU togeather. When the next crisis hits Germany may not have that luxury.  ",2016-07-11 22:48:48+00:00,d58hkxa,1,t3_4sdntv,1375,unitedkingdom

151,"&gt;Summary:.   
Exiting from the EU should be used as an opportunity to embrace openness. The UK should pursue free trade agreements with major trading nations such as China, the USA and Russia and deepen its engagement with organisations such as the G8, G20 and OECD.    
 In Europe, a priority must be to secure open trade relations, ideally by membership of the European Free Trade Area, though remaining outside the European Economic Area. Bilateral strategic relationships with allies such as Australia, Canada and France, as well as emerging powers in Asia and Latin America, should be cultivated.    

&gt;Domestically, a ‘Leaving the EU’ Bill should be brought forward rapidly, to implement the legal secession from the EU two years after activation of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Separately, a ‘Great Repeal Bill’, based upon the Public Bodies Act (2011), should be enacted, bringing about within three years the comprehensive review and, where appropriate, repeal, of regulation of EU origin with the aim of lessening the bureaucratic burden on business, the public sector and third sector. Administratively, the Government will need to strengthen its capacity in a wide range of areas from trade negotiations to anti-trust enforcement.    
    
&gt;Current levels of funding from the EU to sectors and regions should initially be maintained domestically, including in agriculture, to prevent economic shocks whilst the surplus should be recycled to help pay down the deficit. Measures such as tax breaks and supply-side incentives would help preserve the UK’s position as the number one inward investment destination in Europe.
The outcome would be to accelerate the shifting pattern of UK’s exports and total trade away from the EU to the emerging markets, where the majority of the world’s growth is located.    
&gt;A more business friendly regulatory regime and the new security of the City of London from European interference will enhance competitiveness and compensate for the partial loss of access to European markets. The total long-term impact is estimated to be between -2.6% and +1.1% of GDP, with a best estimate of +0.1%. Although the years immediately surrounding the exit are likely to feature some degree of market uncertainty, if the right measures are taken the UK can be confident of a healthy long- term economic outlook outside the EU.",2016-06-26 08:11:33+00:00,d4ofk3k,1,t3_4pwuvh,76,unitedkingdom

209,"&gt;The European Constitution wasn't implemented after the Dutch and French results so I don't get your point. 

The Lisbon treaty contained much of what was in the original European Constitution, it was little more than a rebranding exercise.


&gt;David Cameron hasn't tried to reform the EU but make himself more marginalised within it. 

I agree the UK has a long tale and mostly bad history with the EU, however even outside of that, the idea that meaningful reform can be accomplished is not supported by anything that has ever occurred.  



&gt;I don't know about you but I have voted in MEP elections and if you are going to argue that they have little power national governments (who are democracies) make up the council and the Commission is elected by both. While the house of lords is not elected and they do have power to both block and enact regulation so this point is invalid.

The EU is fundamentally undemocratic, it has to be by its nature to survive and achieve its aims, as we the people, the Europeans do not care and national agendas will inevitably cause deviations and hurdles to overcome on the path to ever closer union. 
The Commission is made up of 28 unelected commissioners, only one of which is elected by us, at the moment that's Jonathan Hilland he get one area of policy to oversee, Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union however this is again at the discretion of the Commission president over whom we have no veto and are continually outvoted. It also worth noting that none of theses commissioners can be held to account as the EU Parliament has no means by which to do it. The Parliament can't propose or repeal laws and even when proposed amendments are made they must be fully accepted by the Commission, this means that once a law is passed into EU law it has been effectively passed forever. The EU has a democratic deficit by design and choice, it cannot and will not ever represent what is best for Britain. 


&gt;India is probably just a culturally diverse as Europe but that manges just fine as one big country.


A comparison between one of the poorest nations on earth and the richest is going to be very limited in nature, as when just surviving is your number one priority everything else can fall into significance. That's not to say that India does not have it's problems, I just feel that little if anything can be gleaned from using India as a metric for comparison. 


&gt;Most people care if their job is secure and they are going to have more money in their pocket. Sovereignty is such a grey area and absolute Sovereignty is so undesirable it is hard to take this argument seriously.


Leaving the EU will not severely impact us to the extent that people will feel a tangible difference and drop in living standards, the number might look big and scary but in reality even taking the worst projections out there it's a negligible drop. Sovereignty is a grey area, however people quickly realise when you take it from them. This is what the EU is doing, the reason we developed nation states in the first place is because we are all different and prefer to be united and run by those who we have commonality. 2008 started this dawning reality, when European governments decided that their shared common cause didn't extend to saving each other from economic hardship.

221,"&gt;There is no economic case for leaving even the most optimistic predictions show that the UK would be economically worse off if it was to leave the EU. The Brexit camp know this that is why they don't focus on it.

That's not a 100% accurate, but I do agree the economic case is clearly for remain. 


&gt;The concept of sovereignty is becoming less and less relevant in this golabalised world that we live in and there is no escape from.

While true, the EU is on a whole different level, there is no questioning that. There is no reason why one cannot partake in international norms and standards without giving over fundamental control of sovereignty. The EU does not just require us to lose some sovereignty in the pursuit of harmonising trade or regulation, it actively seeks to end it. We just saw what happened when Cameron tried to negotiate, even the term regonitate show how laughable it is, he got nothing, he couldn't do anything, the Prime Minster of a country did not have the power to make the changes he wished to make. There are plenty of examples of this, but perhaps the only ones needed are the votes that took place in 2005 on the EU constitution, people voted against it in both Denmark and France, but less than a year later rebranded it was passed.

&gt;In the globalised world that we live in the places with the largest economies and biggest populations are the ones with the most influence so leaving the EU would give Britain less influence not more. 


I agree, we will lose influence, however it will not really have been our influence it will have been that of the EU, nations can and have worked together long before the formation of such an institution. 

&gt;The reason why Britain is the 5th biggest economy is because it is in the EU not in spite of it.

I'm sorry no, that is not true. You could cut 20% of the UK's GDP and it would fall only one place on the economic league table. The EU enhances the UK's economy, however it is not fundamental, not at all. The UK it is also worth noting is on track to outperform almost all developed economies this half century except for South Korea and the USA, surpassing Germany in the 2030s and Japan before 2040. The reason, demographics and the arugably the world's strongest serivce industry, not the EU.  


&gt;The same is true about Westminster or any other country's parliament it is difficult for it not to be like.

Except me and you voted for our elected officials and our parliament is in charge of what law are enacted and repealed, this is not true of the EU's parliament. 


&gt;Identity is in your mind rather than being factual and you can have as many identities are you like. It is ok to identify as being from you town,county,English,British,European,Earther .ect that doesn't mean you have to oppose the advantages of having a Federal Europe as well. 

It does when the former is for all intents and purposes being replaced. Europe is the most densely populated and diverse continent on earth, national identities are strong, our differences are too stark.  

&gt;Saying that a Federal Europe is unlikely as every country in the EU would have to agree to it and it is not just the UK that would have a problem with it.

We saw what happened in 2005 when the EU got an answer it didn't like. It only takes ones IMO mistake and we are in, one politician that is just a little too pro European and our fate is decided, we are struggling to leave now, just think what trying to leave as a state will be like.    


For better or worse I don't think the EU can buy my sovereignty and I am fully prepared to be that little bit poorer and see a noble goal pushed back or fail.

222,"&gt;I have never understood the hostility towards federalism as a concept there would still be a great deal of autonomy between the EU and its member states.

I don't want to live in a member state, I want to live in a country. I think the same is true for most people, asking them one day, not now, nor in a decade but perhaps in 25 years to put down their national flag and pick up the EU's is a hard thing to come to terms with. This is the end goal, it has to be, my children have to believe they are Europeans first not Britions. I think the parallels to the USA's federalism are interesting and I have long suspected the reason for the Americans love of the flag is integral to the formation of a cohesive nation.  Like you have said this might not be the actually end destination for the EU, however I believe that this is their planned trajectory.  


&gt;National governments have the most power within it and the only way you can get what you want is by coming in agreement to make things better.   

They do still in some areas, in other not so much. As I have stated in another comment, the EU cannot be wholly democratic, or rather it cannot be as overly representatively democratic as other governments because it struggles to get agreement on so many issues big and small. 


&gt;If Britain left it would have very little if any input and due to geography would still face a fare amount of the impact.

It would, I'm not swayed by the economic arguments for leaving, for me the matter is about sovereignty.

IMO no reforms are going to align the core goal of the EU, to united the European peoples under a single banner. The institution needs a shock to its core, be it Brexit or Italian banks collapsing and Italexit, is that's a term yet? The EU is becoming locked in place by division amongst national governments and as such EU institutions want to take further control to stop the gridlock. In Europe's current state I don't see how change can occur easily. 

&gt;Revelations most often lead to a far worse set of circumstances than they begin with. To me it is import to keep the whole thing together and to leave would be nothing more than madness.

Which is true. Please read the below which I have posted elsewhere. 

&gt;Here is the irony: Europe dominated the world, but it failed to dominate itself. For five hundred years Europe tore itself apart in civil wars, and as a result there was never a European empire—there was instead a British empire, a Spanish empire, a French empire, a Portuguese empire, and so on. The European nations exhausted themselves in endless wars with each other while they invaded, subjugated, and eventually ruled much of the world. There were many reasons for the inability of the Europeans to unite, but in the end it came down to a simple feature of geography: the English Channel. First the Spanish, then the French, and finally the Germans managed to dominate the European continent, but none of them could cross the Channel. Because no one could defeat Britain, conqueror after conqueror failed to hold Europe as a whole. Periods of peace were simply temporary truces. Europe was exhausted by the advent of World War I, in which over ten million men died—a good part of a generation. The European economy was shattered, and European confidence broken. Europe emerged as a demographic, economic, and cultural shadow of its former self. And then things got even worse.

Firstly world trade is slowly becoming harmonised through TTIP, the TPP, NAFTA and the EU. Why? well many argue the recent push is to prevent China from becoming a standard setter, for the USA which  driving this its all about maintaining global dominance, trade means little to the US economy outside of NAFTA. In the next few decades all the big regulations will have been to large extent negotiated by those who matter, by leaving now the UK will cut itself off from the big boys table, however IMO this is a risk which will dissipate over the medium term. The second and arguably more important issue is the EU itself, it's too big and scary, ""keep your friends close, your enemies closer"", by being on the inside the UK can and arguably has disrupted many unwanted regulations and has stopped any organisation against it.

362,"&gt;“I feel as though I have died and gone to heaven,” said Britain’s skills minister in a recent speech, as he prepares to preside over the fastest rise in the minimum wage in the country’s history.

&gt;The new policy, which starts on Friday, will see the wages for low-paid workers rise four times faster than average earnings this year.

&gt;The world will be watching. Governments in many developed countries are turning to minimum wage policies as they try to deal with inequality and anaemic wage growth.


&gt;The stagnation in wages in recent years has been blamed on the rise of global competition, the decline in collective bargaining, a slowdown in productivity growth and the way in which technology has “hollowed out” some middle-skilled jobs.

&gt;In response, Germany introduced its first ever minimum wage last year; Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe has called for minimum wage increases of 3 per cent a year for the foreseeable future; and some US cities such as Seattle are raising their wage floors to $15 an hour.

&gt;Developing countries such as Malaysia are also using minimum wages to try to redistribute growth more fairly and encourage employers to move up the value chain.

&gt;As Richard Dickens, an economics professor at Sussex university, concludes: “Minimum wages have never been so popular. The next question is: how far can you push it?”

&gt;This is the question that Britain’s new national living wage — which starts at £7.20 an hour and will reach about £9 an hour by 2020 — will put to the test.

&gt;Nick Boles, the skills minister, has claimed it will be “one of the biggest increases in the legal minimum wage that any government has done in the western world in living memory”.

&gt;But the Conservatives did not always feel this way about the minimum wage. Indeed, the party opposed the UK’s introduction of the policy in 1998, arguing it would destroy jobs. “We bring to it the zeal of converts,” Mr Boles admitted.


&gt;Many economists have also changed their views. Economics textbooks used to state that if you raise pay above the value it creates for employers, you reduce demand for labour. In other words, minimum wages cost jobs.

&gt;But economists’ opinions are now more nuanced, in large part because of the experience of countries such as the UK, which have so far sustained steady increases in the minimum wage without doing any notable damage to employment.

&gt;The early signs from Germany are also positive. In spite of nervousness from businesses about the introduction of a minimum wage of €8.50 an hour last year, the unemployment rate has continued to fall and is now at a record low.

&gt;How UK will react to higher minimum wagePlay video
“My view of the history of minimum wages is that we’ve always been surprised about how you seem to be able to push them up without harming job prospects,” says Alan Manning, a professor at the London School of Economics.

&gt;“Of course, there would come a point, if you pushed it up too far, that there would be serious adverse effects. We just don’t quite know where that is.”

&gt;The UK’s minimum wage is already relatively generous by international standards, according to the Financial Times’ “Big Mac” minimum wage index.

&gt;At £6.70 an hour, a minimum wage worker in the UK would have to work 26 minutes to buy a Big Mac. That is better than the US (41 minutes) and Japan (32 minutes), similar to Ireland and Germany, and worse than Australia and Denmark (18 and 16 minutes respectively).

&gt;If Britain brought in its £9 an hour target today, a minimum-wage worker could buy a Big Mac after 18 minutes.

&gt;There are other ways to measure the level of a minimum wage, such as where it stands relative to average pay. The government plans to increase the national living wage to 60 per cent of median earnings by 2020, which would take the UK from the middle of the OECD pack to the upper end.

&gt;The government chose 60 per cent as a target in part because a handful of countries such as France and Australia already sustain minimum wages at that level. France has relatively high unemployment and Australia relatively low unemployment. But it is difficult to make straight comparisons because of differences in how the wages are set and to whom they apply.


&gt;In terms of coverage, OECD data analysed by the Low Pay Commission, responsible for recommending minimum wage rates to the government, shows that about 9 per cent of UK workers currently earn within 5 per cent of the minimum wage — a fairly high proportion compared with peers such as Australia, the US and Canada. By 2020, the LPC’s analysis suggests this figure will swell to about 18 per cent — substantially higher than in any other OECD country for which data exists.

&gt;“We’re going into uncharted waters and we just don’t really know. In some ways it’s a social experiment,” says Prof Dickens, who is also a member of the LPC.

&gt;The big question is whether the UK can maintain its strong employment record, particularly for the lowest-skilled workers, who are about to become more expensive to employ.

&gt;Andrew Hilton, director of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, believes the policy will be “devastating” for entry-level and low-skilled jobs.

&gt;This debate has emerged in Germany recently, too, after concern that the minimum wage is too high to enable recently arrived refugees to find jobs. Some German politicians have called for exceptions to the minimum wage for low-skilled refugees.

&gt;Yet Prof Manning points out that the modelling being done for the minimum wage experiments in US cities like Seattle is encouraging. These analyses suggest low-paid workers will spend more money in the local economy, boosting local demand and creating a virtuous circle for employers and employees.

&gt;He says the UK is right to experiment — and disputes the idea that the country is “stumbling towards a cliff edge”.

What does that even mean?

The UK is forecast to be one the faster growing major economies for the next 5 years, see the [IMF report here](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2015&amp;ey=2020&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=27&amp;pr1.y=11&amp;c=156%2C158%2C132%2C112%2C134%2C111%2C136&amp;s=NGDP_RPCH&amp;grp=0&amp;a=)


&gt;Why else do you think he is now saying that the economy is 'smaller than expected'?

Politics. Osborne knows that there are big economic demons out there and he wants to ensure that his economic credibility is not tied to them if they raise their heads. 


&gt;The UK is not doing well despite the attempts to make the growth seem bigger than it is.

What attempts?  The UK economy has many problems but growth currently isn't one of them.


&gt;That the IMF is urging Osborne not to hit the austerity button even harder should be a warning sign for you.

409,"&gt;If it was true about the economy, that would be fine, but the figures have been exhaustively massaged in order to show growth. This is something that you might have missed, but has been criticised by economists a lot over the last 6 years.

Is this really an argument? All the reputable international bodies, OECD, IMF, World bank and other report growth and yet you think it's a ruse?


&gt;The general consensus is that Britain's recovery would have been much faster without austerity, and that the 'recovery' is nothing of the sort, it's just a slow trudge from one really terrible slump to a slightly better slump.

No doubt it would have been, austerity was not designed to produce growth, the purpose of austerity is reign in chronic deficits. If the UK is in a slow trudge then most of the rest of the world has either stopped or is walking backwards. 

&gt;Hence why he's now declared that the economy is, surprisingly to no-one who's actually been paying attention, smaller than expected.

Total trade accounts for about 60% of our economy, if the world is not growing the UK itself is going to find it hard to buck the trend, this is perhaps the bigger worry, the fact that we are still growing so rapidly. 

&gt;The man is deliberately doing this to try to keep the pressure on the working classes and keep enforcing cuts to the very poorest in the how that they will lose their homes and no longer be registered to vote. He's a liar and a fraud when it comes to economics.

This is what Osborne is doing as the economy is no longer in a slump.

It's a great theory and Krugman's work which I have read makes sense, except for the fact it was wrong in both the UK and USA.

* Homosexual men kissing in public is benevolent and praiseworthy but lesbians doing so is lewd and inappropriate because lesbians appeal to heterosexual men who are after all the scum of the Earth.    

* A Guardian vision of Utopia for Britain would be a country made up entirely of gays, lesbians, non-white people, Muslims, and cyclists. No white straight men who even remotely believe in God would be allowed to stay unless they regularly advocate gay rights and feminism, promote immigration and multiculturalism, pretend to be fiercely atheist,and cycle to work.

Japan $5,094BN    

Germany $4,767BN    

United Kingdom $4,691BN    




&gt;**Japan:** While the league table only shows Japan losing one place as India overtakes in 2022, in reality Japan’s economic performance is one of the worst of the developed nations as a declining population, slow productivity growth and a weaker exchange rate take their toll. At some point between 2030 and 2040 both the UK and German economies are likely to overtake the Japanese economy.    
    

&gt;**Germany:** Our forecast for the German economy is improved from last year as a result of a much larger population than we expected. The additional migration to Germany, mainly from Syria, will make the German population 1 to 1½ million more than we had previously forecast. The additional migrants will boost profits, restrain wage growth and alleviate skill shortages. As a result we no longer forecast that Germany will be overtaken by the UK by 2030 as we predicted last year. However, as the UK is still expected to grow faster than Germany, it is likely to overtake during the following decade. Germany is forecast to be held back by the weakness of the rest of the EU which it will be increasingly forced to subsidise if the euro is to survive.    
    

&gt;**United Kingdom:** The United Kingdom is forecast to be the best performing economy in Western Europe and after overtaking France in 2014 is likely to overtake Germany and Japan during the 2030s. Indeed the UK could reach the giddy heights of becoming the world’s 4th largest economy for a short time during the 2030s if it manages to overtake Japan before it itself is overtaken by Brazil. The UK’s strength (though mainly in London) is its cultural diversity and its strong position in software and IT applications. Itsweakness is its bad export position and unbalanced economy, with many parts of the country heavily dependent on subsidies from the relatively high taxes levied on Londoners. It also runs the risk of breakup, with Scotland and possibly Northern Ireland seceding and will have a referendum on its continuing membership of the EU in 2016 which might prove at best disruptive",2016-02-17 21:20:28+00:00,d03omhj,1,t3_46b21q,53,unitedkingdom

This is why South Korea hasn't invaded North Korea for example, developed nation's simply have too much to lose.

""*Britain has positioned itself superbly for a strategy of waiting, watching and retaining options regardless of what happens. If the European Union fails and the European nation-states re-emerge as primary institutions, Britain will be in a position to exploit the fragmentation of Europe to its own economic and political advantage and have the United States available to support its strategy. If the United States stumbles and Europe emerges more prominent, Britain can modulate its relationship with Europe at will and serve as the Europeans' interface with a weakened United States. If both Europe and the United States weaken, Britain is in a position to chart whatever independent course it must.*""

&gt;We don't need to be in a political union in order to trade with other countries. We should leave and negotiate a simple free trade agreement tailored to our needs. We're the fifth biggest economy in the world, the financial capital of the planet, and the EU's biggest export market. If Mexico is capable of negotiating a free trade deal, we certainly are.


We may be fifth now but we are only going to [fall further down that list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IMF_ranked_countries_by_past_and_projected_GDP_(nominal)#IMF_estimates_for_2020) over this next century, although it's worth noting we do better than most on these long term projections. I fear that our title of financial capital might be lost outside the EU as new regulations imposed would naturally favour locations inside the EU, probably Frankfurt. It's a big gamble and keeping ahead would I think require huge concessions to the banking industry, concessions that I doubt would be popular with the public. 


&gt;Iceland a country of 300,000 people has a free trade deal with China.


An example often cited, however who do you think took the most from that deal? Or has the stronger hand in negotiations? 
The UK played it's financial capital and diplomatic card to China's economic one last year to secure investment, joining the AIB and referring to China as a Superpower. 


&gt;If the EU was truly interested in peace, it would have recognised that reaching out to Ukraine and welcoming the idea that it join the EU would provoke Russia into action. 

I think 90% of the blame for that should be put at NATO and the USA's door, not Europe's. 


&gt;The UK is never going to join a federal EU, so what's the point in us being a part of it?

There is a good point to be made here, although it is worth noting that the UK will become the largest economy in Europe over this century, so further integration may perhaps be more under our own terms in the future.

National interest in short, the UK has always had an outward looking foreign policy due to having a large economy and being a Great power.

&gt;In many ways stability issues in the region are based on who makes decisions for the benefit of who.

All nation's act in their own self interest and the core self interest of most middle eastern nations is maintaining their owns states cohesiveness as they are so internally divided. The natural trend of the nations is chaos, a chaos that nobody has yet had the stomach to let unfold, hence the strong presence of the USA in the region alongside our own.   

 

""*Iraq was anarchy maquarding and tyranny*"" Robert Kaplan.


&gt;Why should our claim over the region

ROI. We extract benefits from being there as mentioned in my previous post. 



&gt;We sure have made things stable for ourselves, but the uprising cannot be ignored. 

I agree, Syria, Libya and Iraq to a lesser extent have been experiments in letting states attempt to find their own path.


&gt;Our control to keep our stability has distracted us to seek stability ourselves, without that control.

I'm afraid you have lost me here. The UK is stable, very stable is always has been hence why we still have a Royal family.

While I am inclined to agree, you only need look at what is unfolding with the migrant crisis to see why people should be rightly concerned. Germany announced it would take refugees enmass and now the EU is threatening other nations such a Poland with legal action if they don't take their fair share. This is again repeated in Greece where they have threatened to cancel the Schengen agreement and move the border northwards turning Greece into  a large version of Calais migrant camp. All this on the most intolerant continent on earth, a continent where countries have proud histories and have waged vast wars over their differences. A common unity among Europeans is not easily found and mass immigration is not going to help this, in fact it has only made Europeans trust each other and the EU less. These are of course little bits on the side compared to the main problem of the time, the German export economy, an economy that all policy making bodies must put first out of fear of destabilizing it and the whole Eurozone. Delving deeper into the matter you must also accept that there is still no a shared European culture or European life, so calling somone European is only to denote their geography not their heritage.  National identities take time to develop and old civilisations have complex national identities that are not easily unified nor aligned.

513,"While true I think there is more to it than reflecting on empire, although I must admit it does pull of the heart strings somewhat and I think that it was is behind a lot of the passion for this matter.  Friedman in one of his better analysis states that Britain's goal must be to balance itself between power, currently the Europe and the USA using each as a counter weight to the other. The EU's end goal negates such a strategy as it would slow take control and limited many of Britain's and other nations core institutions. This is possibly part of the reason behind the recent   'Best friends in the west' narrative preached to China, that and money. Isolationist? I think half the world would argue to the contrary, the UK and at it's heart London is a great trading nation, it needs to be free to act and in post empire it has become apparent that to do this it must ensure no one nation can so dominate the national interest.  


I also take some issue with this idea of Britain still being a power in decline, the stats don't suggest this. In fact I have argued before that the UK will be the only real great European power left by the end of this century. 

&gt;I don't think the sun has yet set on Britain, IMO Britain will remain first among equals in the great power game for long into this next century. Most projections keep the Britain in the top 10 economies up until 2050, along with quite healthy demographics relative to the rest of Europe. This coupled with the lasting footprint of empire will allow the UK to keep the ability to project power globally from the South atlantic, Middle East, Mediterranean and others. Looking very far ahead I think the future looks again quite positive with one recent ONS projections suggesting that the UK population could surge past 100 million by the 2080s which would put it almost on par with Russian and ahead of Japan demographically.

527,"They do however, as u/darthpizza notes while the Russians have an quantitative advantage the quality of those airframes leaves a lot to be desired and will only fall further behind in the coming years.

&gt;This has been coming for at least a year now. The consequences for the Russian Air Force are likely to be far reaching and varied.
The Russian Air Force has about
300 Mig-29
350 Su-27
130 Mig-31
60+ Multi-Role Su-27
120 Su-34 Stike Fighters
300 Su-24
200 Su-25 CAS
70 Tu-22M
59- Tu-95
15 Tu-160
So of ~1600 total combat aircraft 1200 or so are 80's airframes or earlier.
Replacing many of those with modern types was going to be challenging regardless. Now, with their economy slow and their operational tempo causing casualties and presumably maintenance wear and tear, it may become impossible. They've already cut their order of T-50's down to 12. The PAK-DA project they were talking about hasn't actually produced any hardware yet, and with all the conflicting reports I've seen it seems like they don't know what kind of aircraft they want yet. They want to build more Tu-160's, but even during the soviet days those were more handcrafted pieces of art than production line aircraft.
The only bright spots have been their upgraded Su-27 variants, but that's still based on non-stealthy 80's airframes. They seem to be good aircraft, but they mostly started as projects in the 90's, they're already relatively old.
I don't know what Russia can possibly do to prevent their Air Force losing major capabilities in the next decade barring oil over 170$ a barrel.


The real threat for aviation is the Russian S 400 SAM system.

As you rightly point out naval power is the cornerstone of this advantage, that is to say that the UK and France combined currently run with 1 strike carrier, 1 Helicopter carrier and 5 amphibious land ships, with near future procurements bring in the hybrid strike carriers of the the Queen Elizabeth class. In short the seas would be controlled by France and the UK, Russian ships and overseas trade could be allowed or denied by them, however as you note the Russian submarine presence would present significant problems. 



&gt;I don't think people realize how greatly defense cuts to France and the UK have hit them in the past two decades. As bad as Russia has had it, they came crashing down from being the other military superpower in the world and so even in a diminished state, they're still quite capable.


Yes/ No. In the real world the UK and France need only keep the Russians in check, something that they can easily do as described. If it came to conflict then Russia may have the ability to counter the UK and France in certain respects, but this omits the fact that they wouldn't be acting alone, the EU has the second largest combined military budget in the world at $200BN with potential capabilities hugely surpassing that of Russia.

554,"&gt;All bad news for South Korea.

I don't disagree, however South Korea may have to confront such an scenario, at present their goals appear to be both the status quo and very slight pressure to spur regime change. This pressure both from South Korea  and the international community is already causing some trouble for the regime albeit limited at the moment. If this pressure were to one day cause even a slight destabilization of the regime we might see them escalate to try and extract concessions from South Korea or sure up support among their citizens ( a few airstrikes might actually benefit a destabilized regime).  Consider the current propaganda broadcasts South Korea has recently resumed as a crude example, currently the regime sees these as just an annoyance, however if destabilized they might be viewed as a threat.    

We are of course forgetting that a surprise attack would hopefully prevent any use of nuclear weapons and potentially even give the South a chance at securing the Chinese border.

556,"&gt;1. ROK won't ""capitulate on something"" based on shelling alone. They're been shelled for the last 60 years and where has that gotten the North?

North Korea to my knowledge has never shelled Seoul or even come close to it, shelling as only ever occurred on military targets not built up areas. For reference Seoul is basically the South Korean economy, last year it surpassed London in GDP and I think it is due to overtake LA this year. South Korea has never been threatened. 

&gt;NK knows this and so it won't happen in the first place. 

All North Korea knows IMO is that it's force will be met with equal force, however Seoul as suggested above has never been targeted. I


&gt;Even if it did happen, it would take many, many months before the North could do enough damage to seriously steer ROK towards any significant course of action. 

Now I'm no expert but that seems flat out wrong and out of line with what other redditors have suggested. Seoul is in effect Korea, it is home to around 25 million people, half of Korea's population. 


&gt;Many months during which the superior artillery of the ROK and US could neutralize the threat to begin with.

Many months would void the premise of the question though. The nature of any strong counter attack and invasion would be speed. 


&gt;Any premise where the North uses actual force to enforce demands is just silly, they will lose that every time.


This is an untested theory. South Korea would have far more to lose on the face of it. All the North cares about is it's continued existence, that's it! Not casualties, living standards, jobs or citizens wellbeings, just the elites continued existence. The South however care's about all of these things and capitulating when the stake are so high might be a preferable option.

I fear you don't hold a very informed view on this, dig a little into the matters of Ukraine and Georgia and you will see that it was less to do with having a sociopathic neighbor and more to do with broken promises and NATO expansion. Watch the Documentary I linked, part 4 focuses on this very issue. 


&gt;Trying to justify invasion of of your neighbors as caused by ""aggression"" by NATO or whatever is weak, lazy and downright idiotic analysis of European politics, once again your are trying to force your square brainwashed view of the world into a round hole of reality.


**Again please try to be civil, this is r/geopolitics, if you want to attack people's character go elsewhere and do it as this sub is designed for constructive discussion and debate.**     


I don't think it is a lazy analysis, it is perhaps difficult to empathise with I agree, but to dismiss it out of hand would be foolish as nations are rarely governed by idiots, more often it is that we just don't understand their position and strategy. 


&gt;How is this for a theory, people of eastern europe from Poland to Ukraine/Georgia do not want to be under Russian ""sphere of influence"" they do not want misery and poverty and CORRUPTION that is the Russian economic/political path, neither do they have resources like Russia does to delude its population into a feeling of grandeur while the rest of the world is steaming ahead.

Eastern Europe could have attained and has attained much of what you state above by simply being in the EU.


&gt;Putin is making Russia isolated, hated and poor (once again sadly) in order to justify his hold on power. It will all end in tears ( yet again :( )

He is, but it is slightly more complex than that, Russian democracy 1.0 failed due to widespread corruption, corruption which Putin set out to end, again see the Doc I posted. Putin's clamp down on democracy is arguably driven to some degree by a need to protect and preserve the Russian state from becoming what they perceive as another US Western puppet. I'm not arguing that any of this is morally right just that it is perhaps the underlying motive behind Putin's Russian and conflicting US policy goals, intended or not.

I'm not so sure the history backs that up, NATO approached these Eastern Europe in the early 1990s with a partnership before admitting them less than 10 years later along with a missile defence shield proposal supposedly reneging on a deal made with the former USSR regarding East Germany and the ex soviet states.


&gt;For all the rhetoric and propaganda (Yes i watch Russian language satellite broadcasts to this day and its cringeworthy) no one in the West wants to invade or destroy Russian or rape its land for resource, we here have enough problems of our own with Islamic nutcases. The fact that Russia was not invaded at its weakest point in the 90s would underline that.

Then why expand NATO in the first place? Why not just let the EU work its magic


&gt;Putin needs an external boogeyman to distract the cynical Russia sheeple from his own destruction of the country for private gain


He does, but if you watch the documentary I posted you will see that Putin had to behave in that manner.

&gt;I am not arguing that political leaders are geniuses, scholars, or even gentlemen and ladies. Simply, political leaders know how to be leaders or they wouldn't have emerged as such. It is the delight of all societies to belittle their political leaders, and leaders surely do make mistakes. But the mistakes they make, when carefully examined, are rarely stupid. More likely, mistakes are forced on them by circumstance. (George Friedman)

Nations should haven been able to join the EU without the necessity of NATO, this has been a huge mistake on the part of Europeans, after all it is the EU, free trade and investment that creates wealth and development, not NATO. NATO memberships were not needed if we were to trust in the post Cold War world, a world where Russia was a declawed kitten and could barely fight Chechens on it's own door step.  

&gt;if I had to chose between US protection or Russian occupation (as many Ukranians are now finding out) the choice is rather clear.

One might argue that the only reason such a discrete choice exists is due to NATO and the EU becoming intertwined. Russia IMO would not see the EU as a threat if it were not for the now compulsory accompanying NATO membership.

I'm sure we can all empathise with ex soviet states and rationalise their fear, however the USA and Europe should have known better.

710,"&gt; it hasn't even been talked about. So the question remains.

Not directly but you can see the clear actions of the government; inviting the developing nations to the table for trade and investment opportunities and joining China lead investment bank. Cameron has a very clear plan and one that Osborne also subscribes to when you hear the narrative of rebalancing the economy to focus on exports. IMO there is no denying their plan. 

&gt;I don't actually believe this is about getting a surplus at all (I think it's about cutting back the state to nothingness, a Tory aim for a long time but reinforced in the 1970s when privatisation nearly collapsed the economy)

It's worth noting that during the 70's the UK was in the process of imploding, with sky rocketing inflation, 3 day working weeks and strikes every other day. Thatcher and the Conservatives had to act, they were elected on that basis.  

&gt;Serious growth which won't happen without government spending

Are we ignoring the UK's current growth trends? Also why can't the private sector drive growth?

&gt;The IMF say we could easily run on a debt of 190%. 

They do, but it's hardly something a economy should aspire towards, the debt has to be repaid and our demographics indicate it will be repaid by a populace facing the unprecedented burden of an aging population. 


&gt;You say it would take 25 years with inflation

Well you can work it out, maybe more maybe less, of course that's also assuming we have a balanced budget for the entire period, which we won't due to the business cycle. 

&gt;how long would we need to run a surplus in order to tackle the debt whilst running a trade deficit? (Same question)

Depends on the size of surplus you run, Germany is currently posting upwards of 1% with a ridiculous huge trade surplus in the 100s of Billions. The UK will need to assess what size surplus if any works once a balance is in reach. 


&gt;Don't be obtuse about the matter at hand, we both know this is a plan drawn up from a singular paper from the IMF which was complete nonsense.

Does this even need to be discussed? We all known austerity was not implemented for growth.


&gt;The issue we have with oil prices is that they will shoot back up at some point, where does that leave us? Now is the time for investment and borrowing, surely to god.


I don't know, however we cannot force people to spend unfortunately we can only incentivise them, low oil prices should at least serve to help  grow some small to medium size industrial businesses. 


&gt;I did read it and you interchanged debt and the deficit like there is no tomorrow, it's a typical trick of the government. Debt has not gone down one iota.

If it's unclear for you I am more than happy to reiterate my point, but I assure you there is no confusion on my part with regards to this. I fear you are detracting from the discussion here.


&gt;More will surely follow.


Based on?


&gt;The deficit has very little to do with how we recover from recession, as evidenced by our completely stagnant economy.


Well arguably you are saying that it does by advocating for further deficit spending.Stagnant economy? You mean currently the most dynamic major economy in Europe if not the G7.

As stated above austerity makes sure we're in a better position to deal with any forthcoming financial shock.

712,"&gt;One question; how long will we have to run a surplus with a trade deficit to pay off the debt in this manner?

Thier aim is to run a surplus on both, hence the strong trade and investment driven foreign policy the government has. Running one without the other for an extended period of time would create large imbalances. 


&gt;this isn't an optimum strategy for eliminating the deficit by any stretch of the imagination.

optimum, good choice of words, it means different things to different people, hence the old adage of ""*Two economists, three opinions*"". For the Tories and other fiscal conservatives it's reducing the deficit as fast as possible. 


&gt;I'd like to understand why you think austerity is positive for the future at all? 

I thought I had made that element pretty clear,  see again

My fear is that if we don’t take the Conservatives opportunity to reduce debt, we may never do it. Governments tend not to be strong, they make unfunded pledges to get elected and stay in power, this could mean that the deficit is added to time and time again, pushing debt higher and higher, the USA is a prime example of this although it gets there by slightly different means. If the UK’s debt can be dealt with now when we have both the political will and the means then let's do it before we have a government that doesn’t have either the will or the means.


&gt;As long as our debt is at a reasonable level and our income is good it should be more than possible to rely solely on inflation to eliminate our debts.

Leaving aside the current state of negative inflation you must remember that even with the 2% targeted inflation it would take about 25 years to get debt back to the 40% limit Labour suggested.


&gt;It's already understood that austerity doesn't work 

Is it? Austerity is simply reducing spending which Osborne has done.

&gt;Another huge problem you've missed is the fact that we will definitely not be running a surplus in 2020 and so our debt will grow even more substantially.

definitely? I mean I agree it's a hell of a target but let's try not to use absolutes. Correct debt will grow, however Osborne's proposal will see it grow by the least. 


&gt;low oil prices propping up the whole crazy scheme


Most economists I have read seem to consider the low oil prices a bit of a god send.


&gt;So, to sum it up, you're conflating debt and the deficit in order to push an agenda of austerity that makes little sense, because;

did you read what I wrote? 

&gt;We probably can't achieve a surplus by cutting expenditure without the country falling apart at the seams and tax income falling drastically (thus leaving us with a perpetual deficit)

Where has this happened? Kurguman banged on about this in a similar manner in his book ""End this depression now"" (good book if you interested) and made a great case for it with stats and solid theories, however it hasn't occurred here, ironically it has in France which didn't follow strong reforms and austerity though.   


&gt;Even if this works for an extended period of time, our country will be extremely fragile and unable to relieve any recession that might come


and the country would be better prepared with a larger debt burden and deficit? This is the problem I outlined above, it's all too easy to pass the book along.

&gt;If anything scares me, it's the idea that someone could actively think austerity is a good idea at all with the appropriate information.

People like yourself are IMO too quick to shoot down the idea of austerity without trying to understand the merits the strategy may hold. IMO there are several reasons why austerity and reducing debt quickly is important, firstly another recession will strike one day and going into a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre.
The other far bigger reason is that of future economic growth, the UK has an ageing population that will start hitting budgets hard from about 2027 making a balanced budget ever more difficult to achieve. It's worth pausing to think that Japan which has the oldest population in the world and who is also a leader in innovation and robotics has only just managed to stay stagnant over the past decade. The other looming issue is that of European stagnation and an overall global slowdown which could hit the UK hard as it searches for new markets outside of its shrinking pool of consumers.
The country is sold on austerity, this government has a clear mandate off the public, to rebalance the economy and get debt down as fast as possible. It’s rare for a public to be sold on the idea of less public spending, other social democracies struggle to cut spending programs and end up having to pray for growth to return as debt continues to build up. We don’t, we can take a faster route using both growth and reductions.
My fear is that if we don’t take the Conservatives opportunity to reduce debt, we may never do it. Governments tend not to be strong, they make unfunded pledges to get elected and stay in power, this could mean that the deficit is added to time and time again, pushing debt higher and higher, the USA is a prime example of this although it gets there by slightly different means.

723,"Apologies for the copy and paste and the lack of a direct response. The below outlines my core reason for voting the way I did.

&gt;Austerity aim is to reduce a budget defict, a deficit which was running at [11% of GDP](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/334/uk-economy/uk-national-debt/). 





There are several reasons why the deficit reduction was viewed as an economic imperative ,firstly another [recession will strike one day. Going in to a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre](http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7525).    
The other far bigger reason is that of future economic growth and national debt, the UK has an ageing population that will start hitting budgets hard from about 2027 making a balanced budget ever more difficult. [""*10 million people in the UK are over 65 years old.  The latest projections are for 5½ million more elderly people in 20 years time and the number will have nearly doubled to around 19 million by 2050*""](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/value-for-money-in-public-services/the-ageing-population/). This important as even if we assume an average of 2% growth for the next 20 years and a balanced budget (unlikely with the strain of an aging population) , debt will still be above 50% of GDP by 2035. [Above the 40% target set by the previous Labour government](http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/gb/gb2015/ch1_gb2015.pdf).  Not implementing budgetary constraints assumes that economic growth will be sufficient to rebalance the budget and reduce the debt load. This method does however assume consistent economic growth which as I have mentioned above is not something we should take for granted.

They have your quite right, it's a short sighted political move.

&gt;Also however large your surplus is it is not likely to be large enough to buffer a global financial crisis like that in 2008


Exactly, so we would again need to run a deficit which is fine, however if we are not paying it down in the good times it will become less of an option each time. True keynesianism requires a surplus to be run during times of growth like the Labour boom years, allowing for deficits to be run during recessions and periods of low growth.


&gt;this would just mean you are taking money out of the economy and not investing in your economy

It does, however it is not a clean cut as that, as explained in the article. 


&gt;The best way to deal with a possible crisis in the future is invest in a diversified economy,

I agree, which is why courting developing marketing for investment and export opportunities is so important

&gt;the best way to reduce debt to GDP ration is to invest in the economy to grow its way out of debt. 


This is where we differ I'm afraid. It don't think that is an option, an average of 2% growth still leaves us short of the 40% debt limit in 25 years time, and let's be honest and average of 2% growth and no future deficits is not likely. My fear is that this is as good as it gets, the hurdles coming our way in the next decade and a half are going to be huge, we may miss the boat permanently or at least miss the easy opportunity to restore some balance to our budget.  

&gt;austerity just moves that collectivized national debt, which is long term debt, low interest debt and can be paid by progressive taxation, to private debt which is high interest bearing, regressive (as the poorer you are the higher your interest rate and the more likely you need to go into debt) and shorter term debt. Austerity does not get rid of debt from the economy, it just moves the debt to the public and businesses 

economy's like our own do not live in a closed system.

Well there you have it, I hate to be so blunt but you clearly understand the realities of global relations, why moan? China like many east Asian nations is arguably following a development model indicative of their civilizations, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore all had undemocratic command economies only transitioning to democracies later in their development.

Firstly the geo-politics of the South China sea are very complex, however the central theme is trade routes, once you know this you see that China is acting in a very sane manner considering the reality  of their position.  [See map here](http://www.southchinasea.org/files/2011/08/South-China-Sea-reference-map-US-CIA.jpg). Now let's count US allies, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, The Philippines, Australia, Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia. China's lifeblood like most nations trade is completely dependent on these above US allies. The USA is currently the world's only Superpower and has ruled unopposed for close to 25 years and has has total control of the world's oceans and there by global trade for close to 50, do you really think it want to see China on an equal footing? China knows this and is taking appropriate measures to protect its trade routes by expanding out into the South China sea.

789,"&gt;It's contentious whether running a surplus is good for the economy. Running a surplus means the economy is running a deficit. It's also strange to assume government spending can't possibly generate more money than it spends when fiscal multipliers and marginal propensity to consume completely contradict that line of thought.

Quite correct however a budget surplus doesn't have to drag on growth, if an economy is growing at a reasonable rate, which we are the opposite is in fact true, over investment and stimulus has been shown to crowd out private investment resulting in growth becoming unsustainable without public investment. For reference the UK is the world's 2nd largest recipient of FDI at some $1.5 Trillion, public funds and investment is not our only option unlike other nations particularly in the developing world. 


&gt;I'd also argue that the best way to help get out of recession is to change the interest rate. At current we're running a very experimental interest rate, to the point where we don't know whether to raise it or lower it as our next step. Raising the rate would cause serious issues for mortgages and we can't lower them much more without hitting negative interest. It's a very bad position to be in.


I'm not sure I understand you here, we did change our interest rate, we lowered it to 0.5% the ramifications from this are well known even if they haven't materialized.




&gt;You're essentially arguing we should take money out of the economy until whenever the debt is paid off. A debt that has doubled under Osborne.


Correct and debt would have doubled under any government unless you somehow expected like 4% growth annually from 2010.


&gt;I'd say it's almost impossible to maintain a surplus for decades without seriously damaging the economy

&gt;Another issue long term is the ever encroaching automation of many jobs. This current system isn't at all looking towards the future. I'm wondering whether the loss of millions of jobs is more of a problem than an ageing population.

792,"Austerity has undoubtedly slowed economic growth, however austerity was never about growth, it was imposed to reduce the UK's deficit, which in 2010 was running at [11% of GDP](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/334/uk-economy/uk-national-debt/). 



There are several reasons why the deficit reduction was viewed as an important economic consideration,firstly another [recession will strike one day. Going in to a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre](http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7525).    
The other far bigger reason is that of future economic growth and national debt, the UK has an ageing population that will start hitting budgets hard from about 2027 making a balanced budget ever more difficult. [""*10 million people in the UK are over 65 years old.  The latest projections are for 5½ million more elderly people in 20 years time and the number will have nearly doubled to around 19 million by 2050*""](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/value-for-money-in-public-services/the-ageing-population/). This important as even if we assume an average of 2% growth for the next 20 years and a balanced budget (unlikely with the strain of an aging population) , debt will still be above 50% of GDP by 2035. [Above the 40% target set by the previous Labour government](http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/gb/gb2015/ch1_gb2015.pdf).  Not implementing budgetary constraints assumes that economic growth will be sufficient to rebalance the budget and reduce the debt load. This method does however assume consistent economic growth which as I have mentioned above is not something we should take for granted. It's worth pausing to think that Japan a leader in innovation and robotics has only just managed to stay stagnant over the past [decade with its own again population.](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/muhleise.htm) ",2015-10-18 18:16:56+00:00,cw475jv,7,t1_cw469rr,1303,unitedkingdom

&gt;In the 60s companies were bought out for the first time, the investors sold the unprofitable parts in the false belief that it made the business more productive. 

I'm guessing you're referring to privatisation here? The belief in private business being more efficient is not a fallacy, however you are quite correct in that there are many cases where it isn't, our railways being the obvious candidate here.  


&gt;That led to our business being utterly destroyed.

Specific parts within certain sectors of our economy were damaged by globalisation and a change in economic priorities, yep.   


&gt;I see very little difference between that and what is happening now except for many of the cuts being in sectors that actually stimulate the economy.

All state spending stimulates the economy to a degree the only difference is ROI, what you spend and what you get back in return. This sounds simple enough however.... politics, and that's with a healthy budget, consider how much more difficult it is when you have to prioritise due to a constrained budget.

937,"&gt;Will UK follow if US raises rates?
Ferdinando Giugliano, Economics Correspondent
The UK and US may have been at the centre of the 2008 financial crisis but, seven years on, they are two of the most resilient economies in the rich world.
On both sides of the Atlantic, growth has picked up to more than 2 per cent last year and is set to remain robust in 2015.
After a sharp drop in the unemployment rate, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are looking at the first increase in interest rates for nearly a decade.
With the Fed likely to move first, policymakers and businessmen in the UK are left wondering what the consequences of this momentous event will be on the British economy.
And while the direct impact of a Fed increase may appear small, the indirect consequences — including on the BoE’s thinking and the stock market — could be significant.
“Since interest rates have not gone up for many years, psychologically, this is a much bigger decision than it was in the past,” said Philip Rush, chief UK economist at Nomura.
The most immediate effect on the British economy from a Fed move would be via the exchange rate.
An increase in US rates from their current level of near-zero would lead to a stronger dollar, making US imports to the UK more expensive and British exports to America relatively cheaper.
While this would be a boon for UK plc, British companies would also face higher input costs — particularly in terms of commodity prices, which are typically priced in dollars.
However, given the recent decline in the price of oil and other raw materials, these effects are likely to be small.
The overall impact is likely to be positive, but optimists should not overestimate it: the US accounts for less than a fifth of UK exports.
Britain’s single largest trading partner remains the eurozone, whose goods and services have become more competitive on the back of the programme of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank.
“The direct effects of a Fed hike [on the British economy] are unlikely to be very big,” said Rain Newton-Smith, director of economics at CBI, the employers’ organisation.
A more important question is what impact a Fed rate rise will have on the stock market.
In theory, the economy should be able to shrug off even a steep fall in shares.
John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, a professional services firm, has found that there is only a tenuous link between declines in the value of the FTSE and UK national income.
But businessmen still fear a few bad trading weeks could affect consumer sentiment.
“It is more confidence than reality,” said Mike Tomkins, chairman of MandM Direct, an online clothing store based in Herefordshire.
“As retailers, we don’t feel consumers have tonnes of cash to spend in an uncertain world where stocks are falling. In the event, we expect things could get quite tough.”
British entrepreneurs are not alone in watching the actions of the Fed. BoE officials are busy seeking to anticipate what impact the actions of their US colleagues will have on the UK monetary outlook.
For much of last year, it seemed that the BoE would increase first. But a steep fall in inflation in Britain has meant the Fed is now likely to lead the way.
The Monetary Policy Committee will meet on Thursday but is expected to keep rates on hold again.
During a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last month, Mark Carney, BoE governor, sought to dismiss the widely held conviction that the BoE will be forced to mechanically follow the Fed in raising interest rates.
“Domestic economic conditions — conditions affected by domestic monetary policy — still very much matter,” Mr Carney said. “US policy is not the sole determinant of global rates.”
Some analysts note that, in the past, the two central banks have not always moved together.
Michael Saunders, head of European economics at Citi, highlighted how since the BoE became independent in 1997, there were four tightening cycles. Only in two cases has the BoE followed the Fed’s footsteps.
“The BoE is clearly not a monetary satellite of the Fed and nor is it seeking to stabilise sterling against the [dollar],” he said in a research note.
He added that the main reason the two central banks are in similar position now is because they face strengthening economies.
Others, however, are less convinced. Nomura’s Mr Rush believes the MPC is nervous about moving first as it may be exposed to criticism in case of an adverse market reaction or a sudden weakening of the economy.
“Were the Fed to take the plunge first, this would be ‘a convenient motivator’ for the Bank of England to move,” he said.",2015-09-09 12:37:52+00:00,cuvig1o,1,t3_3k8g7a,105,unitedkingdom

It really isn't. Perception matter very little in defining a nation's global reach in today's world.


&gt;How does a 'great power' behave?

A great power has few real constraints on its behaviour,  it acts how it wants using it power to influence global affairs.


You seem to be advocating that the UK put the world first not the UK, something which I do not subscribe to and thankfully nor does the government. All nations are selfish because society and people are selfish. 

&gt;My view is not at all naive it simply fails to fit with your view on the UK as a 'great power' now and forever. No offence but I would argue you are stuck in the past.

&gt;Time to ensure global respect as peace keepers, for manufacturing and goods, world leading infrastructure, healthcare and functioning multicultural society, rather than the ability to have a large military capability and constantly be seeking to use it.


So how would you suggest that we go about that? A larger foreign aid budget? This is overlooking the fact that you don't think we should get involved to begin with. Also it is worthing knowing that the UK is regarded as being top for global soft power, top that's without military factored in. So a large part of our peacekeeping and global infalcue is doe without a shot fired.

947,"Quite correct. It depends whether you buy into the Hegemonic stability theory, the concept that the overwhelming power of one nation previously Britain, now the USA keeps others in check. In order to maintain this though a hegemon must act now and again and incases where its overwhelming power has no leverage, such as with Saddam.  Consider the 1996 Taiwan strait crisis, without the USA's leverage over Taiwan and overwhelming naval power over the PRC (China)  the world might well witness a huge war with a huge loss of life. The USA's presence as mentioned earlier has also ensured that other nations like Taiwan who feel threatened do not pursue nukes.     

Now the UK is separate to this, however IMO there is a place for us on the world stage, firstly we are arguably the second most 'capable' military power globally and as such have a real impact on US foreign policy, not just regionally but globally. We saw this recently with Obama and Syria and I believe this will be the norm going forward, Iraq and Blair was the exception.   

&gt;it creates way more problems than it solves.

mmm at face value yes, but we cannot know the other outcome if we had not acted. It is all too easy to shout at our governments for being shorted sighted but it is not as clean cut as people would like.

&gt;It is the delight of all societies to belittle their political leaders, and leaders surely do make mistakes. But the mistakes they make, when carefully examined, are rarely stupid. More likely, mistakes are forced on them by circumstance.

All feell threatened by each other and as such take prudent measures which inevitable escalates to Nuclear weapons. Both Iraq and Iran played this game. So if Iran was to aquire a Nuke then Iraq would be compelled to follow much like the Battleship saga we had leading to the Dreadnoughts . As an off shoot however you would get both the Saudis and Israel declaring their nuclear weapons adding yet another layer of complexity and reducing all players margin of error. Oh and as an added bonus we would now have two extra nations capable of selling nuclear technology to whomever they wished. IMO the USA showing it would enforce nuclear non proliferation, justified or not has made nations think twice about pursuing them. This is not to omitt the costs of the war to both us and the Iraqi people, but rather another perspective to consider it from.

959,"&gt;When David Cameron was asked on Wednesday whether Britain should offer a home to more Syrians, the prime minister insisted that the priority was to bring “peace and stability” to the war-torn country — not simply “taking more and more refugees”.
That interview was consistent with Mr Cameron’s response throughout a summer in which the grim reality of irregular migration has led to growing alarm across the rich countries of Europe and fostered discord among national leaders struggling to co-ordinate a response.
Even as the crisis has escalated, the prime minister has been confident that he had support among a British public that is the most sceptical towards immigration of any European country.
In Wednesday’s remarks, Mr Cameron stressed that the UK was playing its part but declined to match the scale of the offer of asylum made by Germany’s Angela Merkel, whose commitments have dwarfed other EU countries’.
This was, however, before the prime minister — and millions of others — later that day saw the photographs of Aylan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy found drowned on a Turkish beach after trying to cross the sea to a Greek island. Mr Cameron said that he had been “deeply moved” by the images that were widely shared on social media and published on the front pages of newspapers hitherto opposed to any change in British policy.
On Thursday, for the first time since the crisis began, there was considerable criticism of the prime minister from Conservative MPs, who joined opposition politicians and religious leaders in calling for action. In response, Mr Cameron said that the UK would “review” its policy.
Less than 24 hours later, at a press conference in Lisbon, the prime minister announced that, after all, the UK would take “thousands” of additional Syrian refugees under a joint Home Office and United Nations scheme that has so far resettled only 216 people from the country.
Downing Street officials concede that the images of Aylan, as well as the reaction they provoked, moved the prime minister. Nevertheless, even the most harrowing of photographs is limited in its power. Mr Cameron will continue to plot a cautious path through a complex crisis, while trying to keep pace with an increasingly volatile public mood.
Despite the expansion of the “Syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme” announced on Friday, and an additional £100m in aid spending, the prime minister has not gone as far as his critics at home and abroad want him to go.
Mr Cameron deliberately referred to “thousands” of extra refugees, rather than the tens of thousands he has been urged to accept by campaigners such as David Miliband, chief executive of the International Rescue Committee and a former foreign secretary.
The prime minister also made clear that the UK’s additional commitment applied to Syrians currently in camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, not to migrants already in EU countries.
This distinction reflects advice from the UN that direct resettlement dissuades people from using people smugglers — but it also shows how the prime minister believes that there are two distinct, though related, crises.
The first is the humanitarian crisis stemming from the war in Syria. The second is a wider movement of people crossing the Mediterranean and travelling westwards across Europe primarily for economic reasons.
It is this first crisis that Mr Cameron has responded to this week, while trying to maintain a tough and consistent position on the second.
In doing so, the prime minister hopes to have correctly read the public mood.
There is a reluctance in Downing Street to accept that Britain has suddenly reversed its deep-seated scepticism of immigration, which regularly comes top or close to top of opinion polls about the most important issues facing the country.
And since this frustration with a lack of control over migration policy often underpins euroscepticism, the prime minister must strike a balance as he tries to reach a deal on EU reform ahead of a referendum on membership.
Dan Hannan, a Conservative MEP, argued on Friday: “Britons are, I think, happy to offer sanctuary to Syrians. But we are not happy when the EU orders us to do so.”
Other Conservative backbenchers worry the prime minister may concede too much to a temporary surge in sympathy for the plight of refugees and, in doing so, encourage people already in Europe to migrate to the UK.
Like many politicians this week, Mr Cameron has referred to Britain’s history as a country of refuge over the centuries, from Huguenots fleeing France for England in the 17th century to Bosnians and Kosovars escaping the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
Nevertheless, these offers were rarely made swiftly or without caveat.

971,"&gt;George Osborne will unveil more than £500m of funding for the Royal Navy’s submarine base at Faslane in Scotland on Monday, promising that the money will secure 6,700 jobs and create thousands more.
The UK chancellor’s announcement will be seen as a further sign of commitment from the government to the full £23bn renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent.
But the Scottish National party, which has made unilateral nuclear disarmament central to its political platform, denounced the plan, pointing out that all but two of the 59 members of the UK parliament elected in Scotland in May oppose Trident renewal.
At the start of the last parliament, amid a wider austerity programme, the coalition briefly considered downgrading the policy that keeps a nuclear-armed submarine maintained at sea at all times.
Instead, it decided to maintain a full “continuous at-sea deterrent” involving four submarines.
The new Tory government is likewise preparing the ground for a big decision next year that will see ministers commit to four submarines, to be built by the 2030s.
Cutting their number to three — an idea that Labour recently considered — would put this principle at risk in the event of technical problems with the vessels.
Scottish and Welsh nationalists — as well as the Labour leadership frontrunner Jeremy Corbyn — have argued for the scrapping of the system, which takes up nearly 6 per cent of Britain’s overall defence budget.
Mr Osborne will say that the money will be spent over a decade from 2017 on large projects including ship lifts, sea walls and jetties.
Faslane, the largest military establishment in Scotland, will remain home to the Astute and Successor submarines and their crews until at least 2067, he will pledge.
The SNP reacted angrily to Mr Osborne’s plans. All 56 SNP MPs back unilateral nuclear disarmament and the sole Labour MP, Ian Murray, has made it clear he does not support replacing Trident.
Polls suggest widespread opposition in Scotland to a new generation of ballistic nuclear missiles. But the balance of public opinion that surveys report varies widely depending on how the question is phrased.
John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, said it was wrong for the UK government to press ahead with spending on new nuclear forces without a formal decision by parliament on the issue.
“The United Kingdom government should not be spending money in advance,” Mr Swinney told BBC radio’s Good Morning Scotland.
SNP rails against Osborne’s Faslane investment
Royal Navy welcomes third Astute Class sub to Clyde HMS Artful, the third of the British Royal Navyís new Astute Class attack submarines on arrival at her Scottish base port of HMNB Clyde, Faslane, Scotland, 19 August 2015 from where she will carry out sea trials before entering service later this year. The 7,400-tonne Artful left BAE Systems construction yard at Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria several days ago before sailing to her new home at Her Majestyís Naval Base (HMNB) Clyde. She will provide the Royal Navy with the most technologically advanced submarine Britain has ever sent to sea. HMNB Clyde will become a home for the Royal Navyís submarines and associated support by 2020, creating a submarine centre of specialisation. The base is amongst the largest single-site employers in Scotland, with 6,700 military and civilian personnel, increasing under current UK Government plans to 8,200 by 2022.
The Scottish National party has denounced the announcement of UK investment in the Faslane nuclear submarine base in Scotland.
The SNP also compared spending on nuclear weapons with UK government spending cuts affecting disabled welfare claimants.
“There is something fundamentally wrong with Westminster’s values and priorities if the chancellor thinks wasting billions on nuclear weapons is something to boast about when people are dying within our benefits system,” said Brendan O’Hara, the SNP’s Westminster spokesman on defence.
But the SNP has said it would welcome spending on conventional forces at Faslane, and Mr Swinney made clear that the party was not pushing for all spending on nuclear weapons to be redirected to social spending.
“If we make savings by not renewing the Trident nuclear missile system, that will enable us to use that money to invest in conventional forces,” he said.
Mr Osborne’s announcement follows the government promise in the June Budget to maintain the Nato commitment to spending at least 2 per cent of gross domestic product annually on defence.
Faslane, west of Glasgow, is one of three large naval hubs in Britain, along with Portsmouth and Devonport.
From 2020, it will become the Royal Navy’s “submarine centre of specialisation”, meaning that all underwater capability will be based there, including Successor submarines that are coming into service from 2028.
The site is expected to host about 8,200 jobs by 2022.
Mr Osborne, who is visiting the site, will say the spending commitment will secure thousands of jobs and provide “huge opportunities” for defence, security and technology companies.

975,"&gt;The resurgence of american influence in Europe, in Eastern Europe especially, is an obvious failure of the EU as a whole and of Merkel in particular.

Agreed, it shows just how divided and un unified Europe still is after 20 years of prosperity and movement towards unity. 


&gt;Germany under Merkel's leadership has failed at every step of the way in it's EU leadership. Germany has been more concerned about people and countries that aren't in the EU than those in the EU.

I disagree, Germany has done all it can, it is just not the right country to lead Europe, it is too resented in a continent with long memories. That responsibility IMO should be with France or perhaps Britain, Poland I think is also a candidate in the future. 


&gt;She has failed at every single turn. When the history books will be written about this period in 25 years, I have no doubt nobody will receive as much blame than her, for her unwillingness to put aside local politics at the expense of the EU and simply for her incompetence as the leader of the biggest and most powerful EU country.

Mmmm, I don't quite see it that way, I agree with many of the points you make but I think Merkel was constrained by her reality, the idea of German leadership is not popular among Europeans. Merkel has to both lead and appear not to be leading. ",2015-08-29 09:48:32+00:00,cujligj,2,t1_cujkijx,4782,europe

All nations when dealing with the USA must consider this reality, Europe as a whole is no exception. IMO this expansion into the Baltic is broadly inline with European interests as it guards against weaker states falling under Russian influence. This is not something Europe could accomplish easily on its own due to how slowly and un unified its actions are. So in this respect the USA is providing a quick fix to the problem. However the USA's actions in Europe help fuel the ongoing Russia vs 'American Europe' story, which often has more truth to it than we like to believe. If Europe were to act on its own; unlikely but not impossible then I think we might have a shot at better long term relations with Russian. Europe is however weak, it will not unify in the foreseeable future, which means for such a change in situation to occur you would need a willing European power, a role which can only be filled by France or the UK as Germany has too much history and is already resented by much of Europe.

984,"&gt;Miliband had nothing, that was his problem.

Agreed, but what he did have was a less aggressive version of what Corbyn is pushing.

&gt;I doubt think the country would reject him on trident nor would they reject him on his anti austerity stance. Who gives a shit about his view on America?

He will be attacked so harshly for it, by almost everybody except Greenpeace, it is not a sensible move, nor is it one that people will agree with once the facts are set out. As for austerity, like other have said before the UK is sold on it, you can't stand against it as the majority of people support it. Miliband tried to do austerity lite and still got hammered for economic incompetence, think what Corbyn will look like. The Tories would have to have some very big slip ups for people to start questioning it. Who cares about America? Business and foreign policy a negative campaign against the USA will not work to his advantage as it has for other leaders on the continent, the UK electorate is closer to the USA.  

&gt;If Corbyn can provide a stable message of hope whilst beating Cameron on his record, he's got a great chance.

That's going to be very difficult because A Labour will be in ruins and B the Cameron ministry is still riding high on economic growth and perhaps will be for at least another 12 months. The migrant problem is a big one, but I don't see how Corbyn the Champion of social justice can maneuver correctly to attack the problem head on any better than the Tories, in fact I can only see his background and stance constraining him.

&gt;Earlier this month, Ai Weiwei was finally given back his passport, which had been confiscated by the Chinese authorities.
Just weeks later, he has found himself in the middle of a visa row — not with Beijing, but with London — becoming the latest high-profile critic of the UK’s attempts to curry favour with the Chinese government.

Over the last few years human rights activists and allies in Washington have become increasingly frustrated as the prime minister gas has set off in enthusiastic pursuit of the Chinese renminbi.
Having angered Beijing in 2012 by having his photograph taken meeting the Dalai Lama, Mr Cameron has since been assiduous in courting the Chinese government.
In 2013 he indicated he had no plans for further meetings with the Tibetan spiritual leader, and sealed the rapprochement later that year by taking Britain’s largest ever trade delegation to China.
Last year, Mr Cameron dismayed pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong with an apparent reluctance to criticise Beijing over its attempts to change the voting system in the province.
George Osborne, the chancellor, is now leading attempts to forge trading links between the two countries. But again his key decision to sign up to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, seen as a Chinese rival to the World Bank, has enraged the government’s allies — this time in Washington.
Now British ministers have the wrath of the artistic community to contend with. Just months before a major exhibition at the Royal Academy, officials have denied Ai Weiwei a full six-month visa, choosing to end his right to stay in the UK at the end of September.
The home office says this is because he failed to declare a conviction on his application form. His supporters point out that though he has been arrested in the past, he has never been convicted, and allege the timing has more to do with the visit of Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, in October.
Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of Index on Censorship, a campaigning organisation, said: “The British government has said repeatedly in recent months that freedom of speech and expression are key British values. The home office needs to show this in deeds, not just words.”
Tim Marlow, artistic director of the Royal Academy, took a more cautious line, saying: “We hope for a speedy resolution to this service.” But Mr Ai’s own gallery in the UK, the Lisson Gallery in Marylebone, was damning: “We trust and hope this decision is based on a misunderstanfing and will be quickly corrected.
“As a Chinese citizen and leading cultural figure Ai Weiwei deserves full rights of entry to the UK where his huge audience looks forward to greeting him for the first time in five years.”
Two Labour members of the foreign affairs select committee — Ann Clwyd and Mike Gapes — also condemned the decision.
For Mr Ai himself, the decision is a particular disappointment after the Chinese authorities returned his confiscated passport earlier this month. On Thursday he posted a statement in the comments section of his Instagram account next to a picture of a toilet. It read: “This decision is a denial of Ai Weiwei’s rights as an ordinary citizen, and a stand to take the position of those who caused suffering for human rights defenders.”
The home office defended its actions however. A spokesman said: “All applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with the relevant legislation. Mr Ai has been granted a visa for the full duration of his requested dates of travel.”

&gt;politics and economics both assume that the players are rational, at least in the sense of knowing their own short-term self-interest. As rational actors, reality provides them with limited choices. It is assumed that, on the whole, people and nations will pursue their self-interest, if not flawlessly, then at least not randomly. Think of a chess game. On the surface, it appears that each player has twenty potential opening moves. In fact, there are many fewer because most of these moves are so bad that they quickly lead to defeat. The better you are at chess, the more clearly you see your options, and the fewer moves there actually are available.

with, not least because it required borrowing of no more than about 2% of national

bring this about by increasing public spending less quickly than growth in the economy

People's limited understanding and narrow perspectives always make me think of this quote by George Friedman

&gt;I am not arguing that political leaders are geniuses, scholars, or even gentlemen and ladies. Simply, political leaders know how to be leaders or they wouldn't have emerged as such. It is the delight of all societies to belittle their political leaders, and leaders surely do make mistakes. But the mistakes they make, when carefully examined, are rarely stupid. More likely, mistakes are forced on them by circumstance.

Austerity has undoubtedly slowed economic growth, however austerity was never about growth, it was imposed to reduce the UK's deficit, which in 2010 was running at [11% of GDP](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/334/uk-economy/uk-national-debt/). 



There are several reasons why the deficit reduction was viewed as an important economic consideration,firstly another [recession will strike one day. Going in to a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre](http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7525).    
The other far bigger reason is that of future economic growth and national debt, the UK has an ageing population that will start hitting budgets hard from about 2027 making a balanced budget ever more difficult. [""*10 million people in the UK are over 65 years old.  The latest projections are for 5½ million more elderly people in 20 years time and the number will have nearly doubled to around 19 million by 2050*""](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/value-for-money-in-public-services/the-ageing-population/). This important as even if we assume an average of 2% growth for the next 20 years and a balanced budget (unlikely with the strain of an aging population) , debt will still be above 50% of GDP by 2035. [Above the 40% target set by the previous Labour government](http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/gb/gb2015/ch1_gb2015.pdf).  Not implementing budgetary constraints assumes that economic growth will be sufficient to rebalance the budget and reduce the debt load. This method does however assume consistent economic growth which as I have mentioned above is not something we should take for granted. It's worth pausing to think that Japan a leader in innovation and robotics has only just managed to stay stagnant over the past [decade with its own again population.](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/muhleise.htm) ",2015-06-28 20:57:31+00:00,cslpyu9,1,t3_3bet7d,17981,AskSocialScience

1164,"&gt;I think 2% would be a low-balling of the GDP growth rate.

I have to disagree, the UK has an aging population which is beginning to bite. Japan one of the world's most innovative and technologically advanced nations has only just managed to stay stagnant over the past 25 years with its aging population. 

&gt;You're also forgetting inflation. The debt is denominated in 2015 pounds, or whichever year it was borrowed in. We'll be repaying(realisticaly, rolling over) in 2035 pounds. Nominal growth, as opposed to real growth, will be substantially higher than the 2.6% so we can expect the debt burden to fall even faster. Over the past 14 years, it's averaged 3.7%. That would mean 40% of GDP. Between 00/01 and 07/08, it averaged 5-ish percent. That kind of nominal GDP growth, with a balanced budget, would see debt fall to 28% of GDP.

Very true


&gt;I don't think we're in a position where we need to be overly concerned about the debt burden unless another major economic crisis hits in the next few years. Even then, we have our own currency so it should be fine.

But debt is still high and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s which could leave less room for manoeuvre when that next inevitable financial crisis comes. The other bigger issue is politics, governments tend not to be strong, they make unfunded pledges to get elected and stay in power, this could mean that the deficit is added to time and time again, pushing debt higher and higher, the USA is a prime example of this although its gets there by slightly different means. If the UK’s debt can be dealt with now when we have both the political will and the means then lets do it before we have a government that doesn’t have either the will or the means.

1167,"The IFS have this to say about Labour budget deficit.

&gt;In the years leading up to the financial crisis, the UK economy experienced fairly strong,
and extremely stable, growth. As Budget 2008 boasted, ‘Over the past decade, the UK
economy has proved strong and stable, with GDP growth averaging almost 3 per cent a
year and inflation close to the Government’s symmetric inflation target’.4 But despite this,
at the time of the March 2008 Budget, public sector net borrowing in 2007–08 was
thought to have been £36.4 billion or 2.6% of national income.
This level of borrowing was slightly higher than the Labour government was comfortable
with, not least because it required borrowing of no more than about 2% of national
income in order to keep public sector net debt below the ceiling of 40% of national
income that it had set for itself.5 Therefore, the Labour government was planning a fiscal
tightening to reduce borrowing to 1.3% of national income by 2012–13. It intended to
bring this about by increasing public spending less quickly than growth in the economy
(and much less quickly than it had been increased over the previous few years) and
increasing tax receipts slightly as a share of national income (as a result of fiscal drag and
some tax-raising measures, including increases in alcohol duties and vehicle excise duty).
On the face of it, these forecasts suggested that the public finances were in reasonable
shape. At the time of the March 2008 Budget, the Treasury’s estimate of structural
borrowing – that is, the difference between total spending and total revenues after
adjusting for the estimated impact of the ups-and-downs of the economic cycle – was only
slightly more optimistic than that of the OECD or the IMF (see Box 1.1 for a further
discussion). However, the UK’s public finances could have been better prepared for a
potential downturn.
One way of thinking about this is that – after more than a decade of strong growth – the
deficit in the years prior to 2008 had been substantial and debt had grown as a
proportion of national income in every year since it had dipped below 30% of national
income in 2001–02. To believe this was genuinely cautious fiscal management really
would require you to believe that boom and bust had been abolished – as Gordon Brown
claimed on a number of occasions that it had been.    
 

Labour weren't reckless but nor were they sensible in their economic policy.

""*the single most important fact of the
twenty- first century: the end of the population explosion. By 2050, advanced
industrial countries will be losing population at a dramatic rate. By
2100, even the most underdeveloped countries will have reached birthrates
that will stabilize their populations. The entire global system has been built
since 1750 on the expectation of continually expanding populations. More
workers, more consumers, more soldiers—this was always the expectation.
In the twenty- first century, however, that will cease to be true*""
