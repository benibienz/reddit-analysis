The EU is already on maneuvers trying to bring forward the invoking of Article 50 by putting strong diplomatic pressure of the UK by opening talks with the [Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36656980). IMO this demonstrates that the EU is already looking to gain further leverage on the UK to compound its advantages in trade negotiations, something I didn't think it would do given the huge economic advantage it already enjoys. This IMO means that the UK needs to be prepared for what might not be gentlemens negotiations, as EU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said himself ""It is not an amicable divorce, but it was not an intimate love affair anyway"".    

  
The negotiations are set to take 2 years from the invoking of Article 50, if we assume no extension is agreed. During this time we are going to see both diplomatic and political changes, many unforeseen but some clearly marked, such as the US, French, Russian and German elections as well as the likely Greek and Italian banking crisis. Given theses events and the UK's existing capabilities, what opportunities for the UK to exact leverage do your foresee?     
  


When considering this I think it important to reflect on the fact that despite their show of unity the EU and European nations have different interests and place different value on these interests. The EU is in crisis and is fighting to survive, maintaining the union comes before all else in its calculations. European nation states however, I would suggest must also place focus on both their own economies and individual politicians electoral success.     




A few quick thoughts on what actions the UK could take:    
    


* Drive a wedge between the EU and European nation states
* Target specific industries that are vital to a specific European nation
* Stoke uncertainty during times of pressure on the EU  (Elections, Greek and Italian debt)    ",geopolitics,What leverage does Britain have in negotiations with the EU?,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/4qh8d1/what_leverage_does_britain_have_in_negotiations/

A failure that could make the economic crisis of the past decade all the more difficult to recover from. The developed world, particularly the old world [Europe is ageing](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/01/30/chapter-2-aging-in-the-u-s-and-other-countries-2010-to-2050/) and will need young people to balance its straining [dependency ratio](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/01/30/chapter-3-aging-in-major-regions-of-the-world-2010-to-2050/) and lower its debt burden. The answer to this currently being implemented both in the USA and Europe is immigration from [developing nations](http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/migrants-uk-overview), however driven by in part by the economic crisis this type immigration is now becoming [unpopular](http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-concern) and almost a dirty word in certain regions of Europe. A citizen from a developing nation cannot easily slot into that of a developed nation, this is very true in the case of Europe where societies are old and cultural understandings are deep. I have heard it said that anyone can become British, however you must be born an Englishman. Such [divides](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/assimilation-models-old-and-new-explaining-long-term-process) are more pronounced with citizens from less developed nations or rather non western nations meaning that any such cultural hurdles are exacerbated IMO. So why do developed nations not poach each other citizens? Is it cost or simply lack of young western citizens?

I know there has been extensive discussion on this in the past, with some even disputing whether it was US grand strategy or simply Western democracies responding to small nations who feared being swallowed again.  Either way however we have ended up in the [Second Cold War ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War_II), or at least according to Wikipedia with the outlook only looking bleaker for Western Russia relations.     

[BBC: Putin Russia and the West (2012) Part 1: Taking Control - Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_7gByf1KVQ)



My questions are:    

* Is Russia now back on a Cold war footing?
* What can we be done if anything to ""hit the reset"" button?    

Also    
     
* What might a Europe without any US presence look like today? 
* Is the NATO brand too strong for use in European affairs?      
* Would better Russian cooperation with the West be worth loosing the USA's military foothold in Europe?    


Pondering this myself I think I would like to consider an informal end to NATO or rather the US occupation of Europe. I have contemplated this before and was again struck by the thought when recently [Poland requested British backing for a permenant NATO](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/12079354/Poland-ready-to-offer-David-Cameron-EU-welfare-deal-in-exchange-for-Nato-bases.html) base in return for EU reform support.  IMO it shouldn't be NATO (USA) it can be just European, the UK alone could provide adequate resources to do this even if it would require the relocation of now mostly dissovled [German forces ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Forces_Germany). If US miscalculation was the cause of this surely more USA isn't the answer, are European's really that incapable or lacking of will?     
     

       
 

I think it was Friedman that asserted that the US could never allow a Pan European alliance to form as it would without question displace it.  With that in mind is there any chance that Europe could overcome the USA's grand strategy?
