0,"I imagine there's multiple factors, but I'm just going to focus on one here. In my opinion, the US political system has two important features, which the British system lacks, that has led to medicinal legalization, decriminalization, and recreational legalization being more of a success over there than it has over here - a higher amount of decentralization (the federal and state level system), and a certain level of consistent direct democracy acting on the state level. All four states which have legalized so far have done so through [ballot measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_measure), which are basically referendums. Medicinal legalization and decriminalization in various states have passed through a combination of ballot measures and state legislation. In both cases the overall political attitude of the country is irrelevant, as the decision rests solely with the people or people's representatives of the state (you may have heard of this process before with the states being referred to as [""Laboratories of democracy""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratories_of_democracy)). This allows a gradual change in policy throughout the US whilst the federal government has previously and continues to hold a similar viewpoint to the UK's central government - no movement on the criminality, a deep reluctance to accept medical benefits, etc. The political system in England, and the political control of drug policy in the entirety of the UK is still highly centralized (to the best of my knowledge, there has been little debate and no policy change in relation to this in the recent devolution settlements with Scotland and Wales), so there are very few mechanisms similar to the US ones through which change could be gradually implemented. Things such as police forces adopting a de facto policy of non-enforcement are probably the closest that we get.",2016-10-28 22:31:00+00:00,d9c2opl,3.0,t1_d9bg2yy,28632.0,uktrees

5,"Well, the office of Prime Minister gradually evolved through time, and it's therefore somewhat difficult to pick a specific point at which it began to exist - it is generally recognized as Walpole, but one could also look at the early 20th century for when the role was given any proper legislative recognition, although the de facto role had clearly already existed for quite some time. Another interesting point is when the de facto role of Prime Minister was first identified as such (a thing Walpole denied), which didn't really happen until the 19th century. To quote [this article:](https://history.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/01/the-institution-of-prime-minister/)

&gt; By 1805 The Times newspaper was beginning to use the phrase ‘Prime Minister’ in this sense and around this time it began to be employed in parliamentary debates. The office of Prime Minister was widely accepted as a political reality by the mid-nineteenth century. But official acknowledgement of this development was slower to take place. In 1878 William Gladstone – who served as Prime Minister on four separate occasions – remarked: ‘upon the whole, nowhere in the wide world does so great a substance cast so small a shadow; nowhere is there a man who has so much power, with so little to show for it in the way of formal title or prerogative’.

&gt; Yet in the same year a significant development occurred when Benjamin Disraeli used the term ‘Prime Minister’ when signing the Treaty of Berlin. The list of government ministers printed in Hansard, the official record of parliamentary debates, seems to have first used the title Prime Minister in 1885. An early internal reference to the Prime Minister was included in the minutes of the first meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1902. The 1904 edition of the Imperial Calendar (the predecessor to the Civil Service Yearbook) referred to Arthur Balfour as ‘Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury’; in the previous edition he was merely ‘First Lord of the Treasury and Lord Privy Seal’. Then in December 1905 the Prime Minister was granted a place in the official order of precedence. The first statutory reference to the Prime Minister came in the Chequers Estate Act 1917, which specified Chequers as a prime-ministerial residence. Public recognition of the existence of a ‘Prime Minister’s Office’ in the Civil Service Yearbook came as recently as the 1977 edition.",2016-08-26 20:00:04+00:00,d6xy9sq,2.0,t1_d6xoy30,12020.0,ukpolitics
6,"Not particularly surprising, given the manifesto commitment. It will be more interesting to see how sincere May is about dropping support for UK withdrawal from the ECHR, since her leadership campaign.

&gt; A true British Bill of Rights, decided by parliament and amended by parliament, would protect not only the rights set out in the convention, but could include traditional British rights not protected by the ECHR such as the right to trial by jury.

I wouldn't have a problem with extending the same level of constitutional authority to other rights, with consideration, but I don't think this is an argument in and of itself for replacing the act, as it could be extended through an amendment or another act. 

&gt; May has been inured against the act from her time as Home Secretary, when she struggled to deport foreign criminals who used the Human Rights Act to appeal Home Office deportation orders. 

Other than this issue here, I also can't really see a major reason why they want to replace a bill to make ECtHR judgements 'advisory' instead of saying the UKSC 'must take into account judgments of the Strasbourg Court'. To the best of my knowledge, the other two consistent disagreements are over surveillance and prisoner suffrage, with most of the rulings against the government coming not from the British but the European court, and the result of this has been some embarassment for the government, but with very little actual legislative change. So, I feel the reasoning given from the government at this time doesn't justify the way this legislative action is currently being portrayed, which leads me to one or two suspicions: that the Conservatives are still planning a [rather radical](https://publiclawforeveryone.com/2014/10/03/my-analysis-of-the-conservative-partys-proposals-for-a-british-bill-of-rights/) change which might make a difference in the judgement of British courts, and further demarcates a separation from the ECtHR to legislatively justify continued disagreements (along with, as noted awhile ago, various [constitutional issues](https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2013/03/04/colm-ocinneide-human-rights-devolution-and-the-constrained-authority-of-the-westminster-parliament/) which mean this will not be an easy bill to write and pass), or, more cynically, that it will eventually be presented as a bill that affects little but which draws media attention and allows the body of the government to maintain it's rhetoric on human rights legislation.

A radical redrawing of the act, at this time, with the potential for further inflaming tensions, constitutional issues and relationships with European partners, by a Tory government with a thin majority, looking towards a possibly rocky economy, seems like an overly risky strategy to me, for now. It seems entirely likely it'll be kicked into the long grass, or stripped of serious change through white papers and parliamentary committees. However, I have underestimated the radical (and somewhat gambling) nature of the Conservatives in the recent past, so it's also possible we'll be presented with the novel image of a Tory parliamentary party held to ransom by pro-European MPs.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; The last three governments have continuously failed to deliver an adequate energy policy, according to a damning survey of business leaders released today.

&gt; A poll of nearly 1,000 bosses by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found that seven in ten thought the Labour, Coalition and Conservative governments hadn't provided reasonably priced energy. Two-thirds also complained politicians failed to ensure the UK would always be able to keep the lights on.

&gt; However, they were more positive about the consecutive governments’ track records on renewables. Around six in 10 agreed they’d been more successful in increasing these energy sources, while 45 per cent were satisfied with their efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

&gt; Dan Lewis, senior infrastructure policy advisor at the IoD, said that the newly-created business and energy department should seize this “ideal moment” to reconsider the direction of energy policy.

&gt; The survey suggested business leaders support the government’s focus on increasing the use of renewable energy sources to meet its environmental goals. However, more must be done to realise the two other aims of energy policy, namely security of supply and affordability.

&gt; “Renewables are a significant, and growing, source of energy ... but technology based on the weather doesn’t work all of the time, so the UK needs a mix of renewables, nuclear and the cleanest hydrocarbons,” he said.

&gt; The IoD also weighed in on the £18bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, saying that its huge costs meant the government was right “to take one final look before signing the deal off"".

&gt; The survey showed business leaders harbour mixed feelings towards Hinkley — 53 per cent said it makes strategic sense and less than half think it will increase the UK’s economic competitiveness.

&gt; IoD members have consistently supported nuclear, and the survey also showed more than half back fracking.

It's a possibility, but I think there's a few factors worth considering: Boris won't want to be seen meddling without consent in the Brexit negotiations, as this could attract some ire from the public, and May certainly won't condone it, and she has the power over whether he stays, goes, or is bumped to a more minor cabinet position (which, despite their proclivity for Boris, I doubt the public would really care about). It's possible he'd be able to turn such a situation to his advantage, but I doubt it - not without alienating himself from the government. Also, David Davis is pretty popular amongst the backbenchers, at least compared to Boris, and as Davis hasn't been afraid of looking like a rebel and opposing those in his own party for a long time, he's not somebody Boris wants to make an enemy of, if he's looking to progress his career further. Which he undoubtedly is.

This type of behaviour, as noted on the page, is also contrary to the rules in *Erskine May*.

39,"Since the passage of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, there are only two ways to call a general election before the 5 year term is up. The first is an explicit motion of no confidence in the house of commons, passed by a majority, and the second is a an agreement in the commons to hold an election early, passed by two-thirds of the house. 

Because of these conditions, it is unlikely but not impossible that a general election could be called. There is little chance of a motion of no confidence passing due to the current Conservative majority, without a certain change of circumstances, and an early election agreement would only pass with the combined support of the Conservatives and Labour, and either one seems likely not to support such a motion if they feel they will not benefit electorally. The only point at which an early general election would really make sense is before the official start of negotiations on withdrawal with the EU, if there is a tremendous fuss within Westminster about the government's negotiation plan and they feel that they need to pursue a new mandate, instead of going ahead with the negotiations on the strength of the mandate for their 2015 manifesto. In this timeframe it seems improbable that Labour will consider itself in a strong enough state to gain a considerable number seats and properly challenge the conservatives (as they are, to the best of my knowledge, still trying to stab corbyn in the back), so I personally consider a general election to be somewhat unlikely.",2016-06-25 09:19:52+00:00,d4ncnt3,1.0,t3_4prsbi,677.0,BritishPolitics

However, I disagree that this year is a strategically beneficial time to leave, or rather I think there isn't at present the sufficient conditions necessary to minimize the risk of economic and political instability caused by Brexit to a degree that justifies the risk - so, I am going to vote remain. I also think that politicians and people who portray this referendum as a 'once in a generation' opportunity after a remain result could quite easily be wrong (and that this doesn't reflect the reality of euroscepticism as a political force within the working class and parties like the Conservatives and UKIP), and as I don't think you necessarily have to think 'we have to leave now' to be a eurosceptic, I would be quite happy waiting a decade or so until we actually left.",2016-06-17 13:23:06+00:00,d4cz82v,3.0,t1_d4ci9a8,39555.0,BritishPolitics
44,"1\. I will address mainly politicians and political parties here - if you want to know how it works with the british public, which is slightly more complicated, then let me know. UKIP and a certain contingent of the Conservative party, both on the right, have been the most eurosceptic and the most vocal about it. I imagine you are using the word liberal in the colloquial american sense (to mean left-wing), so there are a few eurosceptic voices from the parties on the left, like Kate Hoey and Frank Field (although nowhere near as many as on the right). There used to be a tendency amongst the hard and far left in the UK to be pretty eurosceptic (the most notable politician in this case probably being Tony Benn), but that appears to have died away somewhat.

&amp;nbsp;

2\. Yes. SNP politicians have been stating that a 'leave' result could be the impetus for another Scottish referendum campaign. One point here is that it could really only be considered so if the result in Scotland, compared to the results in the rest of the UK and/or England, were radically different from each other, and I'm not convinced that there will be such a disparity - polling doesn't seem to indicate there will be.

&amp;nbsp;

3\. The EU bureaucracy (and it's perceived democratic deficit, incompetence, and deliberate obscurity), and financial concerns, are certainly two reasons, but there are others. To list what I think are the most popular, although to be clear I'm not making any judgement on whether these reasons are justified in this comment: immigration, the perceived transformation of the EU into a single state (the 'United States of Europe' idea) which tends to revolve around sovereignty, sovereignty itself, excessive regulation, and the idea that we are an 'awkward partner' who are marginalized by the political processes of the EU and thus lack influence. Obviously some of these (immigration and sovereignty, regulation and sovereignty), overlap quite a bit.",2016-06-16 17:37:31+00:00,d4buxlh,1.0,t3_4oefdj,1630.0,BritishPolitics

There's some decent BBC media which covers current politics, it can sometimes be a bit tedious, some shows are better than others, and I certainly wouldn't recommend rigorously following all of them, but it's pretty good for familiarising yourself with the current state of affairs. Some TV and radio shows to follow - 

[Daily Politics](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mjxb) - daily show analysing politics, which often gets high profile politicians on.

[This Week](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mvhd) - weekly show, airing after Question time, with a slightly comedic approach to political analysis.

[Andrew Marr Show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0080bbs) - weekly show, the one which senior ministers (the prime minister, the chancellor, the home secretary, etc) are most likely to appear on.

[Question Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006t1q9) - weekly topical debate program, with questions from the audience directed towards politicians.

[Any Questions](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qgvj) - radio version of Question Time. Often not quite as annoying as Question time.

[Today in Parliament](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtqd) - daily radio show covering news from parliament.

&amp;nbsp;

[Parliament.uk](http://www.parliament.uk/) and [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/) are both great resources for learning how parliament and government functions, and learning about legislation. If you'd prefer a less fragmented read, such as a book, then [Exploring British Politics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Exploring-British-Politics-Mark-Garnett/dp/140820441X) by Garnett and Lynch seems like a good introductory source, though I will add the disclaimer that I've only used it occasionally as a reference book, and it is fairly pricey.

&amp;nbsp;

It can sometimes be difficult to understand the significance of things in politics without a basic grounding in the historical context, so I will recommend some more books to help with that (although much of the info can be found online). Two of the most important figures in recent British political history are Thatcher, and Blair. Charles Moore's [Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography, Volume One](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Margaret-Thatcher-Authorized-Biography-Turning/dp/0713992824) is a good book for starting to understand the political context of the Thatcher era, although it is obviously quite biographical too, and being the first volume it only covers roughly the first third of her time in government. The comprehensive tome on Blair and his wide-ranging effect on the functioning of british politics is surely Seldon's [Blair's Britain, 1997-2007](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Blairs-Britain-1997-2007-Anthony-Seldon/dp/0521709466), although I will warn you that is it most definitely a tome - incredibly thorough and a bit of a slog. The best way to approach this is probably to read the sections on things you are interested in, like the NHS, and leave the rest until you feel you want to learn about them. Sections of Seldon's [Cameron at 10](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cameron-10-Inside-Story-2010-2015/dp/0007575513) are definitely worth a read if you want some more insight into the first Cameron ministry, and the coalition years.

&amp;nbsp;

I can't really recommend any comprehensive histories on the political parties (although what I've read of Tim Bale's [The Conservatives Since 1945](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Conservatives-Since-1945-Drivers-Party-Change/dp/019923437X) is pretty good). One I would recommend is Goodwin's [Revolt on the Right](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Revolt-Right-Explaining-Extremism-Democracy/dp/0415661501), which offers a fairly original analysis of the phenomenon that is UKIP. There's a more up-to-date follow-up to that, ([UKIP: Inside the Campaign to Redraw the Map of British Politics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0198736118/)), which I imagine is also pretty good, but I haven't read it. Familiarising yourself with general political ideologies (to rattle off an incomplete list: one nation conservatism, high toryism, classical liberalism, social liberalism, libertarianism, social democracy, democratic socialism, etc), how these relate to each other, and how they have manifested in the various 3 main parties over time is a must for understanding the parties and the political tensions within them.

55,"Indeed. Seldon's *Cameron at 10* suggests the opposite, as does Oakeshotte and Ashcroft's *Call me Dave*. IIRC, a lack of correct oversight and a hands off approach to the functioning of government and the development of policy is touted as one of the big reasons for Lansley's cock-up in Health under the last government. There seems to be a general agreement in sources I can find that Cameron gave ministers 'considerable latitude over policy development and communication' - another article which covers this attitude of his during the coalition years can be found [here](http://www.britpolitics.co.uk/academic-articles-all/evaluating-david-cameron-as-prime-minister) (in the *Style of Policy Making and Decision Taking* section). 

Now, his approach is probably more hands-on than it was during the coalition years (due to his learning from errors, and being no longer bound by the strictures of coalition), especially at the beginning, but I've seen very little so far that leads me to believe that the opposite is true, and that cabinet ministers have been reduced to the role of carrying out orders delivered directly from CCHQ.",2016-05-20 16:07:41+00:00,d3d24qf,3.0,t1_d3cyl06,4888.0,ukpolitics

&gt; 1) The family goes to a lawyer and asks her to take over the prosecution. Do you not have a set department for that? Or did I misunderstand the show, and that woman is a prosecutor who is on sabbatical? 

As /u/GaryJM noted, criminal prosecutions in England and Wales are generally handled by the Crown Prosecution Service. However, as the relevant page on [cps.gov.uk](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/private_prosecutions/) says, ""The right to bring private prosecutions is preserved by section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act (POA) 1985"", meaning any private individual can bring a prosecution to court, though this is largely an aside to your question.

&gt; The second reform was Tony Blair’s decision to appear before the Liaison Committee – the committee consisting of the chairs of the other select committees – twice a year. The first meeting took place in July 2002, and his appearances lasted for two and a half hours at a time, during which he was quizzed by the MPs in depth. Each session covered a different theme or set of themes, with the Prime Minister knowing in advance the subjects to be covered but not the exact questions. These sessions did not attract the attention that they deserved, partly because Tony Blair proved rather good at answering or deflecting the MPs’ questions, and so the committee rarely landed any heavy blows. But the innovation remained considerable. It represented a significant advance in the scrutiny of the Prime Minister: it was the first time for sixty-five years that a Prime Minister had been before a select committee – and it will now be very difficult for any future Prime Minister to refuse to attend such meetings.",2016-04-11 15:31:33+00:00,d1yj5pb,1.0,t3_4e71v6,74035.0,BritishPolitics

70,"&gt; I am unable to watch passively whilst certain policies are enacted in order to meet the fiscal self imposed restraints that I believe are more and more perceived as distinctly political rather than in the national economic interest. Too often my team and I have been pressured in the immediate run up to a budget or fiscal event to deliver yet more reductions to the working age benefit bill. There has been too much emphasis on money saving exercises and not enough awareness from the Treasury, in particular, that the government’s vision of a new welfare-to-work system could not be repeatedly salami-sliced.

Interesting to see two of the main driving forces of the conservative party - their agenda of radical state reform, and their agenda of fiscal conservatism - come to loggerheads in such a fashion.

The second, is that he has jumped, possibly before being pushed, due to failing to combat a legal challenge to keep some information regarding problems with Universal Credit secret (which I [linked to yesterday](http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2016/03/17/ids-loses-legal-challenge-to-keep-universal-credit-problems)). Myself, I'm unsure about whether either of these theories hold any weight but I'm perfectly willing to entertain them, and they could very well be contributing factors to his decision to leave - although it's worth noting that this is not the first time in this parliament that [Osborne and IDS have clashed over cuts](http://news.sky.com/story/1589038/have-ids-and-osborne-settled-spending-row).",2016-03-18 21:17:35+00:00,d15027y,1.0,t3_4b08jn,671.0,BritishPolitics

72,"Here is the full article:



&gt;    The refusal of some men to use force against a woman — even in selfdefence — makes them vulnerable to domestic abuse, the brother of a lawyer murdered by his wife has said.
    Double standards surrounding domestic violence meant that male victims could struggle to get help even when their lives were at risk, said Peter Edwards whose brother, David, 51, was stabbed to death.

&gt;    Peter Edwards said shame could also leave men reluctant to confide in friends and family who could raise the alarm. Professionals trained to spot abuse, including the police, needed to look more closely at situations where a man may be at risk, he added.

&gt;    Sharon Edwards, 42, was jailed for life this week for her husband’s murder. She stabbed him in the chest last August, weeks after their wedding, having subjected him to over a year of physical abuse and psychological torture.
    More than 60 older injuries, including stab wounds, were found on his body. Details of his ordeal left many at Manchester crown court wondering why he did not defend himself. The tall, well-built lawyer could have floored his wife with one push.

&gt;   Peter, 50, also a lawyer, based in London, said this was part of the problem. “My brother would never have raised his hand to a woman,” he said. “There are a lot of men like him and that means they are leaving themselves in a position of vulnerability. He had told her he would never hit her, even in self-defence, and she had gloated about it, used it to try to provoke him. But, bless him; it is just something he would not have done.”

&gt;    There has been a revolution over the past decade in how professionals treat domestic violence. All are now trained to spot the signs. There are also strict rules about how they should respond. These, however, did not prevent Mr Edwards’s death.
    His brother said that agencies would have acted differently if David, 51, had been a woman. He told at least one doctor and one nurse during a visit to A&amp;E that he was a victim of domestic abuse. They referred him to a domestic violence unit but there was no follow up.

&gt;    Police in Chorley, where the couple lived, knew his wife was attacking him. Officers were called to the home several times. On the night he died, police intervened when she assaulted him but an officer left after “a bit of banter”.
    The case is rare but not unique. Each year 19 men are killed by their partners or ex-partners; fewer than the almost two women a week killed by their partners, but a problem nevertheless.
    David Brooks, chairman of the ManKind helpline for abused men, said men would be believed if they went to the police or other agencies but that could often be a hard step to take.
    Mr Edwards said there was a lot to learn about emotional abuse. “People understand physical abuse, they can see the scars,” he said. But they don’t realise how damaging psychological abuse can be. By the time the physical scars are visible it may be too late.”

&gt;    Violence that dare not speak its name
    About 600,000 men and 1.3 million women suffered domestic abuse last year.
    Male victims (29 per cent) are more than twice as likely as women (12 per cent) not to tell anyone about partner abuse.
    Only 10 per cent of male victims go to the police, compared with 26 per cent of women.
    The number of women convicted for domestic abuse rose from 806 in 2004-05 to 4,866 in 2014-15.
    In 2014-15, 19 men died at the hands of a partner or ex, compared with 81 women.
    Four in five of men who call a helpline have never spoken about abuse before.

80,"In case anyone else gets hit with a paywall after closing and opening the page a few times (or has already hit their limit with nursingtimes.net today): 

&gt; Healthcare assistants already working in hospitals will be able to skip the traditional degree route and train on the job to become a nurse under a new initiative, it has been announced. New degree-level apprenticeships are being set up which the government said will allow more people to become nurses, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills has announced. The programme is targeted at top healthcare assistants, described by ministers as the “brightest and best”, who may not have the qualifications they need to do a nursing degree at university.

&gt; The Nursing Higher Apprenticeship will have a degree built into and will have to satisfy the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s standards, including the 50:50 balance between theory and practice learning. It must be delivered by one of the NMC’s approved education institutions.The scheme is one of the recommendations made last year in the government-commissioned review carried out by journalist Camilla Cavendish into HCA standards and training.A group of NHS organisations and private providers − dubbed trailblazers by the government − are developing the degree-level apprenticeship scheme in partnership with the body Health Education England. They include Northampton Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Barchester Healthcare, Priory Group and Bupa UK.

&gt; Skills minister Matthew Hancock said: “We want the new norm to be for young people to either choose to go to university or begin an apprenticeship. This announcement is another step forward in making this the case. I would like to thank the organisations involved in this trailblazer project, and hope their future recommendations for the degree level nursing apprenticeship will provide the NHS and private providers with a group of highly skilled and confident nurses.” Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “The comprehensive degree programme prepares potential nurses for the decisions they will need to make, through a combination of clinical placements and classroom study.
“Just last week, a wide ranging report proved the link between the proportion of degree educated nurses and significantly fewer patient deaths,” he noted. 

&gt; Latest data from the seminal RN4CAST study showed having a better educated nursing workforce reduced unnecessary deaths. The study, published in the Lancet, found every 10% increase in the number of bachelor’s degree educated nurses within a hospital was associated with a 7% decline in patient mortality.
Dr Carter added: “We recognise that there is more than one way to prepare a caring person for the demands of this training, and apprenticeships will be a good route for some people.
“The nursing profession needs to hear more detail about how this scheme would be funded, and to be fully engaged in evaluating how well the schemes work in practice,” he said. Sue Covill, director of employment services for NHS Employers, said: “Many employers are looking forward to implementing the degree level apprenticeship which not only supports their recruitment plans but also widens access into nursing for their local communities.”However, universities expressed “serious concerns” that the development of a Higher Apprenticeship in Nursing would not tackle the barriers for support workers who have the potential to become registered nurses.

&gt; Professor Ieuan Ellis, chair of the Council of Deans of Health, said: “The barriers for support workers accessing nursing degrees are usually either lack of equivalence of educational qualifications or lack of funding support. A higher apprenticeship will not in itself tackle these issues.” Professor Ellis added: “With the existing flexibilities in work-based higher education, it’s not clear what value this [programme] will add. We need to focus on sorting out the funding and on making sure that appropriate education and training that enables support workers to progress to higher education is available to them.”

81,"some vague ramblings;

&gt; Despite that, I clearly had more important things going on, because I don’t remember anything much about politics until the Iraq War. If you’ve ever wondered why the Iraq War is SUCH A BIG FUCKING DEAL, the phrase ‘I don’t remember anything else about politics until the Iraq War’ is a bit of a clue.

This certainly strikes a chord with me, I don't know about anyone else. I vaguely remember some political events preceding the Iraq war (9/11, and the invasion of Afghanistan being the main ones), but the Iraq war, from when it started through the first five years of the conflict, was a rather formative time for myself politically, and probably for many others of my generation - I believe I was 10 at the time I started taking an interest. From somewhere around this time I began reading the newspaper my parents bought (the Daily Mail, not that you can tell these days), and whatever I could get my hands on, online, and the result of this was the majority of material I read was heavily critical of the Blair government's foreign policy, and often of the entire system of international politics as it exists. It was only years later, in my late teens, that I discovered writers such as Chomsky who were undoubtedly the inspiration for much of what I had read before, and in my early 20s when I started to rigorously analyse my own beliefs and categorize what I had previously known or read. I know from my group of friends that the Iraq war was somewhat central to some of their formative political experiences, and the impetus for their direction of travel - is this a common trend for the other millenials who also browse this sub?",2016-03-05 01:55:41+00:00,d0o3hqq,1.0,t3_490gnb,1034.0,BritishPolitics

90,"Interesting question. The Representation of the People Act, 1884 says that a 'felon convict' was 'legally incapacitated to vote', and The Representation of the People Act, 1867 says 'A convicted felon is disqualified'. I can't find any direct reference using the same words in the Reform Act 1832, but it does say, whenever it concerns the eligibility of someone to vote, that they have to be 'not subject to any legal incapacity', so presumably this would cover being imprisoned. I'm not entirely sure which of the acts of parliament predating this cover election law, so I won't go any further back. So, there are two possibilities. My knowledge of the 19th century legal system is rather dire, and it's entirely possible that people could have been imprisoned, but not necessarily due to a felony, and therefore they were allowed to vote (but maybe not before 1867) - although this possibility seems rather slim. The other is that since we have had anything resembling a proper democracy in the UK, prisoners have been denied the right to vote.

edit: As a sidenote, the development from disenfranchisement for people 'subject to any legal incapacity', to disenfranchisement for 'convicted felons', to people who are currently imprisoned, seems to show a gradual extension of suffrage to people with criminal convictions.


edit 2: To clear up the confused middle of the paragraph - this HoC library document informs me that:

&gt; Persons convicted of a misdemeanour only (a less serious crime) did not lose their property rights on conviction and, accordingly, any imprisonment did not legally disenfranchise them unless they were physically prevented by the fact of being in prison on the day of the poll.

So, all prisoners were disenfranchised during imprisonment, whilst convicted felons were deprived of the vote even after imprisonment. This doesn't appear to have changed until the Criminal Law Act 1967, although after the Forfeiture Act 1870 felons didn't automatically forfeit their land and goods.",2016-02-25 07:17:58+00:00,d0d10je,1.0,t3_47cooa,62594.0,ukpolitics

92,"Two disclaimers: I am not a conservative or someone who votes for conservative parties, and the majority of what follows is largely just my opinion, derived from my experiences discussing politics, and overly generalized with scant statistics or other data to back it up.

First, to deal the Tories, and with ideology; A major feature I've encountered is a dislike of taxes, and of parties who they fear will raise taxes, which is where I assume part of your characterization of them as ""greedy nutters"" comes from - but I don't think this is completely fair, or at least it is too simplistic. Whilst a lot of them presumably dislike the idea of more tax because they might end up with less money, I find a greater motivation is a distrust of the state, a belief that it is inefficient and bloated, and that the private sector can provide better results. The tax issue is a small part of a general belief that state intervention in the economy should be as limited as possible. I always picture the conservatives as an uneasy alliance between social conservatives and economic liberals, and these beliefs, I believe, stem from that economic liberalism. On the social conservative side, I imagine many have been disappointed with the last 6 years of Tory government, which has very much left in place the social policies put into place by New Labour and in some areas such as marriage equality, extended them, but they may still view them as the best bet on many issues - crime, drugs, immigration, etc, although a whole bunch may have switched to UKIP, thinking that the Tories merely talk the talk, and little else. Others are single issue voters, focusing on things such as fox hunting. Now, a fair proportion of tory voters who I have talked to are not primarily motivated by ideology, but have instead taken what they see as a pragmatic decision - they simply do not trust the other parties enough to manage the public finances, to regulate the economy in the most optimal way, or to project our national interests powerfully enough on the world stage - this most commonly applying to Labour, with many people viewing it as a two-horse race, or with the addition of thinking the Lib Dems are fundamentally untrustworthy after breaking election pledges. In my opinion, it is voters of this type who managed to swing the elections for New Labour, and who are now doing so for the Tories. An attitude I've encountered frequently enough for it to be noteworthy is a cyclical view of British politics - they see Labour as a party who comes into office and grows the state, and eventually runs things into the ground, and the Tories as a party who come along and fix things back up again, though often in an overly brutal fashion.

Now, to deal with UKIP; UKIP are somewhat different, although the party itself contains that same uneasy mixture of people who are largely economic liberals (and also largely socially libertarians, such as Farage himself) and people who are largely social conservatives (say, Paul Nuttall), united through euroscepticism and a socially conservative view on immigration. I think it is misleading to characterize UKIP as merely a party of 'disgruntled conservatives', though, and there is something rather distinct about their voting base which isn't always apparent. To quote from Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford's book 'Revolt on the Right: Explaining Support for the Radical Right in Britain' (which I recommend to anyone who wants to understand the phenomenon of UKIP), this was their description of UKIP's core voting base in the early 2010s:

&gt; Contrary to those who argue that UKIP's voters are middle-class tories, we actually find that their base is more working-class than that of any of the main parties. Blue-collar UKIP voters outnumbers their white-collar counterparts by a large margin.. ..This picture is reserved in the main parties, where the middle class dominate. 

&gt;We find a similar pattern when we look at education.. ..UKIP's coalition is dominated by those who left school at the earliest opportunity.

&gt; 57 per cent of their supporters are over the age of 54, while just over one in ten is are under 35.

These typical UKIP voters are named as the 'left behind' working class voters - Often older, with less opportunity, many of whom are Old Labour voters who have seen the party drift away from them and who see their country changing in front of them due to increased levels of immigration, two main parties who are increasingly both liberal and centrist in various ways and who provide few solutions to the specific problems that they encounter in their lives and see in their communities. They feel marginalized by the political system, and have settled on a party which, in their mind, stands up to the establishment and provides solutions to their problems - or at least, one solution. Of course, many UKIP voters come from a wide variety of backgrounds and political positions and simply want to be out of the EU, for a multitude of different reasons (immigration, bureacracy, sovereignty, a belief that it holds us back in the system of global trade, etc), and may not hold this 'larger picture' view of the direction in which British politics is moving.

96,"&gt; Smoke inhalation (including weed) isn't exactly a clever idea though, and it would be a blow to the credibility of the British medical industry and profession if we started prescribing it as good treatment on our socialised medical services.

Well, nobody has suggested this, as far as I know. Even if it has to be inhaled it doesn't have to be smoked.

&gt; The medical profession's well established checks and balances which apply the scientific method to the development of mass marketable drugs for market. It's not much but personally I rate it better than /r/trees.

So you would be happy if it got the go-ahead from the MHRA? Do you think they do a thorough enough job vis-a-vis other medicines? Also, what do you make of studies like [this?](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/cannabis-eases-chronic-pain-better-than-commonly-prescribed-opioids-study-suggests-10003330.html) Somewhat confused as to why you're mentioning /r/trees.

&gt; Just because other treatments are worse doesn't mean that weed is by default better. 

On the principle of charity I'll assume you mean 'other treatments are bad' - I'd agree, in the case of psychoactive  cannabis medicines. More research needs to be done. However in the case of non-psychoactive medicines, I haven't really heard or seen any evidence that indicates they may have bad side-effects.

&gt; Also, I know several people who I would consider 'addicted' to weed. When you've called the cops on your neighbour again because of how he reacted when his girlfriend wanted him to clean up his act now that he's a dad and hid threw the weed away, you gain an insight into why handing out marijuana (in any context) is a flawed idea, based largely on ideology and agenda more so than evidence and concern for the wellbeing of others.

Yes, some people have problems with cannabis use, I don't really think irresponsible recreational abuse of the drug is necessarily relevant to a discussion on medicinal use, though. I also don't think anyone would make the argument that cannabis is more or even equally as addictive as many other drugs which people are perfectly happy with our doctors prescribing - do you think they should be removed from the health service?

&gt; But hey, toke up. That's just her problem.

This, along with the /r/trees reference and the 'ideology and agenda' comment, is frankly rather demeaning. If you're not prepared to have a conversation about the subject without making constant insinuations that those who disagree with you are uneducated potheads with an ulterior motive, then I'm not sure anything productive will result from the discussion.",2016-01-26 14:23:03+00:00,czcj0c3,4.0,t1_czchujm,2388.0,BritishPolitics
97,"&gt; Given that everyone's reaction to weed is different (some people get baked, some get the giggles, some get hungry, some get deeply and disturbingly paranoid)

You make the assumption here that all these people are going to be using cannabis products that are psychoactive. To quote from the article:

&gt;  She makes her own cannabis-based skin cream that she can use at work, which has no psychoactive qualities and can easily be disguised so that no one knows she is using cannabis.

Furthermore, what is your basis for the assertion that other medicines always do the job of relieving pain in a far more consistent way? If we take as an example multiple sclerosis, there have been many instances in which cannabis gave patients more consistent pain relief and a higher quality of life than previous treatments they had tried - partially because it has a wider scope, as it can also be an anti-inflammatory and anti-spasmodic as well as a painkiller. 

My third point would be that for chronic conditions which cause severe pain, other medicines (such as opioids) can actually be extremely addictive drugs, which is not necessarily a safer treatment.",2016-01-26 12:03:40+00:00,czcfoh8,2.0,t1_czbwl3w,41707.0,BritishPolitics
98,"&gt; Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of “burying” an internal Labour report that warned the party was seen as “nice” but also “in thrall to the undeserving” and in denial about its economic record.
After Labour lost May’s general election, the then interim leader Harriet Harman commissioned Deborah Mattinson, founder of the Britainthinks polling firm, to study why voters had rejected the party.
But while a separate report by Dame Margaret Beckett was published last week, the Mattinson report has been kept hidden from the public eye.
Ms Mattinson, a former pollster for Gordon Brown, said on Sunday she was concerned that her research was a “massive missed opportunity” and that lessons would not be learned from the doomed election.
Entitled “Emerging from the Darkness”, the report finally emerged on Monday when it was leaked to Robert Peston at ITV News.

&gt; It is based on voter research from marginal constituencies in areas including Nuneaton, Watford, Croydon and Glasgow.
The report warned that “Labour negatives are deep and powerful” and that the party needed to shift back towards the centre ground. Ed Miliband, the former leader, was seen as “weak and bumbling”, it added.
It advised Labour to “atone” for its past, to revitalise its brand, represent middle class voters — “not just down and outs” — and be seen as competent.
Swing voters saw it as an “incontrovertible truth” that Labour in government had been “wasting money and spending money on wrong things”, the report found.
It recommended that Labour should commission a Tory to carry out an independent review of the party’s economic performance in government.
""We all know much of this because we’ve heard it on doorsteps time and time again — the reality is that the leadership would rather bury it and get on with building their alternative parallel socialist utopia that will only ever exist in their minds"".

&gt;The Beckett review had also found that Labour had failed to “shake off the myth that we were responsible for the financial crash” — but largely blamed that perception on a hostile media.
Ms Mattinson acknowledged that Dame Margaret had “picked up on the economy” but said the former foreign secretary had not analysed it in any depth. “It’s reduced down to one bullet point in the report.”
Instead the report was unapologetic and defensive with “nothing that really shone a light on what had gone wrong”, she said on Sunday.
MPs called on their party leadership to release the full Mattinson research. Wes Streeting, a Blairite MP, said: “We demanded publication of the Beckett report but it seems the Mattinson report is the one we need to see.”
Another MP told the Financial Times: “We all know much of this because we’ve heard it on doorsteps time and time again — the reality is that the leadership would rather bury it and get on with building their alternative parallel socialist utopia that will only ever exist in their minds.”
Greg Hands, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, ‎said the new report proved that Labour remained a “threat” to Britain’s economic security.
“This secret report confirms that the public hasn’t forgotten the mess Labour got us into with their borrowing, debt and taxes,” he said.
“Yet they are still in denial about their appalling track record on the economy and now Labour want even more borrowing, even more debt, and even more taxes.”

&gt; But one Labour source said the report vindicated the decision by current leader Jeremy Corbyn to embark on a review of party policies.
The Beckett report found that leftwing policies, such as the energy price freeze, were among the most popular put forward by Mr Miliband. But it also suggested that Labour had lacked a convincing overarching narrative.
Meanwhile Ms Mattinson wrote in an article for Progress, the Blairite think-tank, that having Mr Miliband as leader had inhibited Labour’s chances of success.
“There is no doubt that his leadership was a major problem,” she said. “To some, he was the personification of Labour’s well-meaning but ineffectual brand, and keeping him out of No 10 was a strong motivator for those voters.”

To remove this could put other systems in jeopardy (for example, the Jewish Beth Din, or the many secular ways in which people use arbitration proceedings), and to specifically target Islamic courts would be, I think, politically impossible.

107,"The Drug Policy Reform Act 2016.

**1\.** The sections of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 concerning personal possession of substances will be repealed. A new system modeled roughly on the [Portugese system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_Portugal#Regulation) will be introduced for substances not otherwise dealt with in other sections of this act.

**a.** The supply of substances to minors will be demarcated as a specific, separate offence with harsher sentencing guidelines.

&amp;nbsp;

**2\.** The possession and production of cannabis for personal use will be legalized. A licensing system similar to the alcohol licensing system will be introduced for the commercial production and sale of cannabis products. These products will be taxed through VAT and a tiered duty system based on the potency/chemical makeup of the product (this will necessarily be a fairly complex due to the variables involved - higher THC content = higher duty, higher THC/CBD ratio = higher duty, etc). 

**a.** The ACMD will be given  powers to create a framework in which to categorize a substance as a novel psychoactive substance, and any cannabis-licensed premises found to be engaged in the sale of novel psychoactive substances will be subject to a fine and having their license rescinded.

**b.** A new offence will be introduced, making the sale of or the purchasing of cannabis products for minors carry the same penalties as the sale of or purchasing of alcohol for minors.

**c.** The legal age for buying cannabis products will be set at 18 (although I am open to the idea that whether the precise age is 18 or 21 should be devolved to authorities at the level of national assembly, county or unitary authority and GLA, etc).

&amp;nbsp;

**3\.** A commission will be set up to investigate the potential costs and benefits of a program to license individuals for the purchasing and personal use of certain psychoactive substances, namely psychedelics (mainly understood as 5HT2a receptor agonists), empathogens (monoamine releasing agents that are primarily serotonin releasers), and dissociatives (mostly NDMA receptor antagonists). If such a program is decided to be beneficial, the commission will also be tasked with finding the best way in which the controlled purchase of these substances could be made available to licensees. The licensing system will function on the basis that people should be able to obtain a license so long as they are willing to prove that they are;

**a.** not suffering under any serious mental illness and do not have a family history of serious mental illness that could be exacerbated by the use of these substances,

**b.** not addicted to any of the substances in question, and

**c.** have a basic understanding of the functioning of these substances, the effects of these substances, and an understanding of the most responsible way to act, and deal with common and/or negative situations which arise, whilst under the influence of these substances.",2015-12-19 19:26:18+00:00,cy4q2hj,1.0,t3_3xho3c,2855.0,BritishPolitics

&gt; When independent traders in a small Welsh town discovered the loopholes used by multinational giants to avoid paying tax, they didn't just get mad. Businesses in Crickhowell are starting a TV campaign to stop tax avoidance by the likes of Google and Starbucks - by employing the same accountacy practices.

The Powys tax rebellion, led by traders including the salmon smokery, coffee shop, book shop, optician and bakery, could spread. Residents want to share their tax avoidance plan with other towns, to force Treasury into legislation to crack down on loopholes which allowed Amazon to pay just £11.9m of tax last year on £5.3bn of UK internet sales.

129,"This is an interesting question - I'll address what I think is my ideology, and not necessarily the ideology or ideologies of the lib dems as a whole. It'll be easier for me to do, and I personally think they are pretty close to each other, so it should give some insight. A thing to bear in mind is that I don't have one defining root to my ideology, or rather, it is syncretic and, I hope, pragmatic - being overly ideological can result in a person twisting or misinterpreting the evidence, and shoehorning ill-fitting facts to try and justify their beliefs to themselves. It is better, imo, to go where the evidence leads, and absorb good ideas from across the political spectrum.  So, I would lay out the main basis for my beliefs in 4 stages:

1. Rights, and liberty. I believe a modern society functions best when people have a wide range of rights (both positive and negative), and a high level of freedom to determine their own path in life. This manifests in many ways: as human rights (to life, free speech, a fair trial, privacy,  religion, association, from torture, slavery, discrimination, etc) to protect people from authoritarian governments, as freedom to make economic decisions and also as employment rights to prevent them from being exploited (which both neccesarily constrain each other). I believe these to be necessary: socially, to ensure the 'marketplace of ideas' thrives and we can continue to progress as a society, to ensure the individual is empowered so the state can never become an oppressive force, and to ensure the state does not abuse the people;- economically: because I believe a vast amount of evidence shows that giving people the power and freedom to make their own choices is the best way to ensure economic growth, so long as there are constraints in place to prevent people from being exploited.

2. Democracy. This is more of a moral issue, but my argument follows as such - the government, or the state, should not be some organization that is alienated or abstracted from the people, but it should be a mere representation of the people, their mandate and their collective desires. The more the state tends towards the former instead of the latter, the more I find it to be fundamentally unjustifiable. The more unjustifiable it is, the more uncertain and unstable our future - as a free society - could be, as people become more disillusioned and less engaged in civic life and the political processes. So, as with the previous point, this manifests itself in various forms - devolution and decentralization (to give people more power from the local to the regional to the national level), electoral reform (to ensure the democratic power of every citizen is maximized, and there are no 'wasted votes' or pseudo-democratic election results), and more democratic accountability for both our political institutions, and our elected representatives - to make sure the people who are actually in control of the state are the people. 

3. Equality. Now, this is not an easy one, because there are many different conceptions of equality in political theory, but I will try to keep it simple. We should work towards social equality, and economic equality (providing our solutions do not overly constrain the freedoms of individuals), because social inequality can lead to grievances, self-segregation and other deleterious effects which have a net negative effect on society as a whole - and economic inequality can lead to the same problems, as well as constraints on economic growth in certain circumstances. When thinking about economic inequality, we need to draw a distinction between whether we want to achieve equality of outcome, or equality of opportunity. I think it constrains the freedom of individuals less to focus on achieving the latter, whilst always bearing in mind the former. This necessitates, to me, things such as functioning infrastructure and education, and a welfare state and healthcare.

4. The rule of law. This is something that has a long tradition in the UK, reaching back to the magna carta, and is imperative to just governance. Every decision taken by a government or individual in a position of political power has to conform to a legal system which is transparent, and accessible for every citizen. My argument for this would be similar to my argument concerning democracy - the state must be justifiable to the people, and arbitrary use or abuse of power is the quickest way of undermining this.

Evidently, attempting to combine these bases into a coherent ideology is somewhat difficult and can, in more complex cases, result in conflicts between them. But I think a reasonable way of combining them (albeit with exceptions arising), is as so: point 4 stands alone. Point 1 trumps points 2 and 3 in most circumstances, and point 2 trumps point 3 in many circumstances - or, more simply: Nothing should violate the rule of law. Democratic decisions, including decisions to promote equality, should not violate people's human rights, or excessively constrain people's freedom, and decisions to promote equality should not violate the democratic will of the people. At this point, I could go on, because one could continuously explore more points and justifications, ramifications and intricacies of any political philosophy - but I think this is a solid, fundamental basis for a modern liberalism.",2015-11-11 03:58:19+00:00,cww61j1,1.0,t3_3sc98y,15703.0,LibDem

That might be the scenario for some people, but not most. If it becomes spent after 1 or 2 years, I would say it's almost certainly not worth risking another conviction (especially if it results in a much longer period until you have no unspent convictions) - but on the other extreme, if you've got a conviction that can't become spent, or won't be spent for the maximum (7 years, iirc) obviously that is a whole different ballgame. I imagine this balances out somewhat, with the severity of the conviction a person fails to disclose being an aggravating factor in the sentencing for failing to disclose it, but I'd have to look into it much further to ascertain that.

134,"To the best of my knowledge, there are 4 main arguments which the tories have used. I may not get some of these exactly correct, so any corrections or rebuttals are welcome;

1. For some people, it results in money being taken out of their income in tax, and then paid back to them in tax credits. The tories (and probably others) view this as inefficient and bureaucratic.

2. If a person receives a pay rise, or moves to a better job with a higher wage, this could result in their tax credits being cut the next year, and them ultimately having the same amount of income - so in this sense it could work as a disincentive for people to seek better employment. This is contrary to the intent of tax credits, which is to incentivize people to get into employment.

3. The tax credits system has expanded massively (from £1bn to £30bn) since it's inception in 1999 and it's transformation in 2003, to an extent which nobody at the time predicted, and to the point where it is a strain on public expenditure. This seems to me to show it is more of a symptom of a problem (low wages) than a problem in and of itself, but I digress.

4. Through propping up people's wages, the tax credit system could arguably be viewed as an indirect subsidy from taxpayers to businesses, to help them maintain their workforce. As an example, say, person A receives tax credits and would not be able to maintain their level of employment if they did not receive them, due to not being able to pay for a childminder or other childcare when they are at work, etc. The alternative to them receiving tax credits would be if they were employed for a higher wage. Such a thing could easily be viewed as unfair, if one thinks it is the duty of an employer to make sure it is properly paying it's workforce (and ultimately maintaining a sustainable business), and not the duty of the taxpayer. This is, to me, the most convincing argument.

Now - these are all arguments against tax credits, and I don't think you'll find many politicians on either side who would defend tax credits as an ideal system. It was, and is, a quick fix for a deeper, underlying problem - low wages. The real crux of the issue is whether what the tories are doing will address this underlying problem, or whether it will simply strip away the support for people who are exposed to this problem. The tory argument is that, through introducing a progressively higher minimum wage across 5 years, and through increasing the personal allowance (the amount you can earn without paying any income tax) by £1700 across 5 years, they will be able to mitigate the majority of the tax credit cuts for the majority of people who receive them, and partially address the underlying problem. Personally I don't feel these changes will be enough to either address the problem or mitigate the changes, and the IFS, to an extent, agrees. There is definitely a rationale though, even if you don't agree with their maths, and this combination (tax credit cuts, minimum wage increases, personal allowance increases) is the policy that underlines their 'lower tax, lower welfare, higher wage economy' mantra.",2015-11-09 14:22:46+00:00,cwu2ixa,1.0,t3_3s4rk5,2390.0,unitedkingdom

136,"&gt; People in drought and flood striken areas and areas that have a high concentration of CO2 may consider climate change more of a problem. Since due to climate change people are leaving North Africa and migrating into Europe might that not also put more pressure on housing throughout Europe? I am not able to gauge the effect on the UK.

Yes, this is a good point - increased immigration due to climate change in the best case scenario will put more strain on the housing supply (as some believe increased immigration already has), and in the worst case scenario the situation could become completely unsustainable, and not just due to housing. So in a sense, the issues are interconnected in the long term due to one potentially exacerbating the other. Also worth mentioning is that some of the potential effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, could result in terrible flooding at certain places in the UK (particularly the south-east coast), which would further exacerbate the problem, so they are not just linked due to events in the rest of the world. My post was more addressing the short term problems and effects of the current housing situation (which, as a complex issue, I fear I didn't quite do justice too anyways), but a more long term view is certainly valid and reveals potential problems that the other doesn't, although it is, due to it's inherent nature - of being over the longer term - maybe slightly more speculative.",2015-11-01 18:08:44+00:00,cwklpb3,6.0,t1_cwkkdn5,2275.0,politics

The UK has not been building enough houses every year for at least a decade now, and this is exacerbated by many factors - the fact that house prices have recently been growing faster than wages, that the population has grown consistently, and cuts have been made to the government departments that are meant to help alleviate these issues, amongst other things. This issue can have real detrimental effects on the economy, and a real detrimental effect on people's lives, especially the younger generations.

*Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography, Volume One: Not For Turning* by Charles Moore  -  covering from Thatcher's early childhood to the Falklands war, Moore was apparently granted unprecedented access to whole swathes of information from Thatcher's life and government.

I thought both of these were great and they gave me some insight into two political figures (one from before my time, and one who, to some, constantly evades any adequate explanation), couldn't recommend them enough.

Two in the same vein, *The Global Minotaur: America, the True Origins of the Financial Crisis and the Future of the World Economy* by the now infamous Yanis Varoufakis, and *The Storm: The World Economic Crisis &amp; What It Means* by Vince Cable. The former was the more engaging read, the latter perhaps somewhat unfocused due to attempting to address a wider range of issues and problems. Interestingly enough, Cable kindof agreed with the fundamental point of Varoufakis, although he probably didn't think of it of as much importance.

141,"Yes, I do think the Lords had a constitutional mandate to make this decision, although I don't believe there is much precedent to the current situation, and some legislative reform may be necessary to place these issues on a firmer footing.

First, here is what Baroness Hollis (Lab) said to the house, quoting the Clerk of the Parliaments (the HoL official who's job entails offering expert advice on House procedure):

&gt; However, does it nonetheless break convention by trespassing on Commons financial privilege? No. The advice from the Clerk of the Parliaments—and he has seen and confirmed my words on the specific issue—is that Commons financial privilege is exercised in two ways. We can amend an education Bill, say, but the Commons can reject our amendment if the Speaker certifies that the Commons has financial privilege on this issue. Secondly, says the Clerk, the Commons can pass a supply or money Bill, which we cannot amend. He goes on: financial privilege does not extend to statutory instruments—it simply does not. Nor are statutory instruments covered by the Salisbury/Addison convention.

&amp;nbsp;

So, there are two different arguments here.

1, If this were not a statutory instrument, this would not deprive the House of Commons of exercising financial privilege, as they would be perfectly able to reject the amendments through the normal procedure due to financial privilege. As an aside to this argument, there is very little reason (other than the political) for why the Tories could not have introduced this change to tax credits through primary legislation and not a statutory instrument. It is true that the original legislation, the Tax Credits Act 2002, allows the government to amend the Act through a statutory instrument, but it definitely does not place an obligation on the government to do so. To the best of my knowledge they were aware of the opposition in the Lords to this statutory instrument well before the point where it became impossible to withdraw this and introduce a proper amendment to the relevant primary legislation. As I implied before, I think the reason to introduce this change through a statutory instrument and not primary legislation was not simply motivated by a want to 'do it by the book', but also to opportunistically avoid any rigorous oversight on such a momentous decision (and one could even argue that £4.4bn of cuts is far too momentous a decision to be taken through such a procedure) - to quote Baroness Lister (Lab):

&gt; Getting an impact assessment out of the Government has been like pulling teeth. That which finally emerged is a travesty; much of it simply reiterates repetitively the rationale behind the policy. It certainly does not provide the information about potential impacts that SSAC [Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee] sought.. ..There is no information on the impact on different groups affected, including the self-employed, who, as we have heard, cannot benefit from an increase in the minimum wage.. ..In the letter accompanying the impact assessment the Chancellor excused the delay on the grounds that the Government do not usually publish an impact assessment for statutory instruments of this kind. I found this statement very revealing.

&amp;nbsp;

2, Financial privilege does not extend to statutory instruments.  To further strengthen the argument of the Clerk of Parliaments, I'll quote from the *Companion to Standing Orders*:

&gt; The Parliament Acts do not apply to delegated legislation. So delegated legislation rejected by the Lords cannot have effect even if the Commons have approved it.

&amp;nbsp;

There is also another convention 'that the Lords does not usually object to secondary legislation' - but the operative word here is 'usually'. IIRC, between 2000 and 2014 the Lords rejected 4 other statutory instruments in similar fashion (I believe this to be correct, but I may have got the number slightly off. Corrections as always are certainly welcome).

&amp;nbsp;

So - to sum up. In a sense this was somewhat unprecedented due to the particular constitutional peculiarities concerning the intersection of motions of this kind regarding statutory instruments, the financial privilege of the commons, and what the procedure should be for situations of this kind. But, I'd argue that just because it is somewhat unprecedented does not mean the Lords were not justified in taking such a decision, both constitutionally, and due to the government attempting to circumvent the spirit, if not the letter, of parliamentary procedure. To quote Baroness Thomas (LibDem):

&gt; As it is, for the Government to decide to make a very controversial change by way of an unamendable statutory instrument, and then to bully members of this House into passing it by telling us that we are provoking a constitutional crisis if we do not agree to it, is surely quite unacceptable. We should stand up for what we believe to be morally right.

144,"I'll mainly focus my post on the two countries I am most familiar with (the US and the UK).

It's probably worth pointing out that the electoral trends are not so clear cut as a shift to the left or the right even taking one country on it's own, for example the USA - Obama has won both presidential elections (and, to me, it looks more likely to be a democrat who wins the next one), but the republicans have held the senate since the beginning of 2015, and the house since 2011. So, you have a divide between different elections on where the electorate seems to be moving - democrats might be best placed for the presidential election, republicans for congressional elections, and even more so for republicans when it comes to the state legislatures - [this Vox article](http://www.vox.com/2015/10/19/9565119/democrats-in-deep-trouble) gives a good summary of the problem the democrats face there.

The divide is somewhat different in the UK (if we ignore european elections, where there is a similar divide with the massive UKIP gains in 2014), as it is more geographically based, than based on elections. England and Wales do seem to have shifted to the right, with the collapse of the lib dems, the rise of UKIP (going from 3.1% to 12.7% of the vote), and a slight rise for the tories. Scotland is a somewhat different picture, with the SNP taking all but 3 of the Scottish seats in the UK parliament, which could possibly indicate a comparative shift to the left - but this analysis of the situation is complicated by whether you consider SNP's more left wing policies, or their independence policy, to be the greatest attraction for the Scottish electorate.

So - I'm sure the situation is as complex in other countries - but if I had to provide a summary of the general trends, I would say the USA and the UK are becoming more politically polarized (but in different fashions), whilst northern europe is moving to the right, and parts of southern europe are moving the left.

2. The government decides to move cannabis from schedule 1 to schedule 2 (different from controlled drug classes - [read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Drug_in_United_Kingdom)), which would open the way for medicinal cannabis to be more available for those who need it.

3.

The prescription, from the doctor. As for the cannabis and to what conditions it would be applicable, this is less clear, as it would need to be licensed as a medicine first before you could get it in the UK. Prescription medicines can always be prescribed 'off-label' if your doctor thinks it will be a useful medicine for treating a condition the medicine is not specifically licensed for, but this is dependent on the individual doctor's opinion and I imagine the majority of them will be very cautious in the event we end up with medicinal cannabis.

171,"I am fairly knowledgeable about the parliamentary process, but this is not something I've looked at in-depth, so I apologize in advance if any of it is incorrect -

The debate will take place in Westminster Hall (as opposed to the Commons chamber), so no vote will be held on the matter. The Chair of the Petitions Committee (grouch and Labour MP Paul Flynn) chairs the debate, and from here on in two things can happen - Either the Chair of the Petitions Committee decides that the motion needs further consideration and he takes it to the Backbench Business Committee who decide whether it will be formally presented to the house again (in the Commons chamber), or any MP may also introduce it to the house through the standard paper petitions system, typically before the adjournment debate on any day, in which case a debate in the chamber will also be considered by the Backbench Business Committee - although in the latter case it is more likely to just elicit the same response from the government as it has already received. However I am not entirely sure whether a vote would be took even in these cases - the likely course of events for a vote to take place seems to me to be a debate upon the petition in the hall and then the chamber, and then for the subject of the petition (to legalize cannabis) to be reintroduced in the form of a private member's bill or 10-minute rule bill, written in proper legislative form, in which case a vote would be held. It is also entirely possible that it could be introduced as a private member's bill or 10-minute rule bill without these intermediate steps. The other alternative is that the Tory government would take the prerogative and introduce a bill on the matter itself, but the chances of that seem infinitesimally small.

This is of course dispiriting, but we should all be aware that this debate on the subject will probably not lead to the legalization of cannabis, and it's highly likely that it won't go any further than the debate in Westminster hall itself - but if it does go beyond that, there is still a lengthy and tedious legislative process before it reaches the point where cannabis might be legalized.

173,"&gt; Going back to Cultural Marxism, if you can condition a population to not think for themselves then you can use the media to control them. People are inherently well natured and if you can hinge an argument on an accepted virtue then unthinking people will censor the target, it's really sophisticated. If people say what they believe and never apologise then Cultural Marxism is hamstrung(well until you're fired from your job for a riske sexist joke on twitter).

This is the point at which the argument becomes, to me, incredibly strange. If you believe that this is cultural marxism, and you believe that cultural marxism finds it's ideological roots in the Frankfurt school and/or other marxist views on society, then why is this critique of cultural marxism so incredibly similiar to the neo-marxian critique of capitalistic mass media put forward by groups such as the Frankfurt school? To quote Marcuse's (one of those most connected to the Frankfurt school) 'One Dimensional Man':

&gt; The means of... communication..., the irresistible output of the entertainment and information industry carry with them prescribed attitudes and habits, certain intellectual and emotional reactions which bind the consumers... to the producers and, through the latter to the whole [social system]. The products indoctrinate and manipulate; they promote a false consciousness which is immune against its falsehood... Thus emerges a pattern of one-dimensional thought and behaviour. 

It seems entirely bizarre to me to accuse a group of people of being the driving ideological force behind the very thing that they were criticizing many decades ago - and if they are not connected ideologically to this, I find 'cultural marxism' a strange label to give to it. On education, and on the shortfalls on modern media regarding primary sources, I find myself in agreement. I'm not entirely sure of your take on private schools, but I know little about them and my only experience with them is Hitchens' recounting of his school days in 'Hitch-22', and Tom Sharpe novels, so I will not challenge you there. And, on your last point - the current structure of the media does need to change to allow such rebuttals for people, but I don't think legislation is necessary (and I actually think it may be an overly drastic case of state intervention). The 'democratization of the media' that is occuring, largely due to social media, will, in my opinion, go some way towards fixing this.

174,"&gt; Before social media though(and even media in general) you heard what was being said first hand and would likely get an idea of context. 

I'm not sure I really agree with this, but it's a layered statement so I'll deal with media first. To give some examples of why I don't really agree - before the proliferation of mass media I don't think one would be more likely to hear the views of most people first-hand than after, unless one actually met them in person, or had access to, say, pamphlets distributed by the person containing their views - one would still hear about the views of most people second- or third- hand (purely by dint of the impossibility of most people meeting most people, especially public figures, as well as lower rates of literacy and the lack of access to more verifiable material), with just as much a possibility of labelling, misquotation or misrepresentation. I do though think it's probable that mass media exacerbates this problem through the concentration of ownership limiting the possible range of sources the information filters through (one hears it from a news corporation instead of the local community), how much easier it is to disseminate information to a larger group of people, and how such a thing has become a business model. With regards to social media, I think an exacerbation is also present but it is countered by an access unparalleled in human history to the primary source of the information - that person actually expressing their views.

&gt;  Now people are given labels, misquoted and put down by the sheep taking it at face value so the ""well intended"" shouting down of people and ideas is censorship by another method other than central government.

As with the previous remark regarding social media, I think it may have exacerbated this simply due to more people being able to communicate with more people (and now one can be demonized or lionized by millions instead of just one community), but I think this access also alleviates it somewhat in that people now have a much greater opportunity to go directly to that person and find out their views. To come back to my previous comment, I still disagree that this is a recent thing, but is a possibly fundamental human behaviour, albeit one that has taken on a different form due to incredibly rapid changes in the way that people communicate or absorb information.

&gt; There is extreme an unacceptable behaviour and the above example is just as evil as normal bullying, even more so. But... if you create a shit storm out of nothing you can sell papers and raise awareness for your cause. I'm guess I'm just your typical disgruntled Daily Mail reader! :p (joking, I only read the occasional DM article, maybe even just for the comments section).

Agreed on this point, mainly. People like to be outraged, or they feel justified in feeling outraged, so it was inevitable it would become monetized. I imagine I am just as disquieted by this cultural phenomenon as you are, though it should be noted that the Daily Mail is as susceptible to this as another other media outlet (which I also read, it being something of a guilty pleasure).

&gt; What do you think about the Tim Hunt incident Amerie?

To be frank I didn't pay much attention. His remarks seemed somewhat odd, and the reaction seems pretty unwarranted.

Edit: Regarding my distaste for the term 'cultural marxism', [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateFascism/comments/2v9qzc/the_frankfurt_school/cok3ix7?context=3) is a more succinct criticism than I could write.

It is not clear whether the Thatcher government itself would have even accepted these proposals, as Thatcher and many in the cabinet were against capitulating in such a manner, but the fact remains that the Argentinian government rejected them first, rendering this point moot.

Cheers. It is quite embarrassing how there were no rebellions on these bills at all.

&gt; If it sounded like I was blaming the Lib Dems for US actions, I didn't mean it that way. I meant that they share lots of the information GCHQ collects with the USA, and vice versa, possibly as a way to get round surveillance laws.

Of course - largely my fault for misinterpreting your intent there.

&gt; Obviously the minor partner in a coalition can't do everything, but there must be limits to what they are willing to do or not do. I hoped that censoring the involvement of the previous government in kidnapping and torture and allowing the tapping of major Internet backbone cables were such limits, but they don't seem to have been.

Concerning the censoring, it was clearly the incorrect thing to do, but I imagine there was very little they could do about it, as it seems likely it was conducted by the foreign office, and, given it's sensitive nature, the information may not have been accessible to most people in government until it broke in the press (although I imagine that Clegg, as a member of the Privy Council, could have been aware - but I don't know specifically if such an issue would be discussed there). From what I can gather the foreign office was the state department the Lib Dems had the least influence over, with no secretary, ministers, or under-secretaries from the Lib Dems after Jeremy Browne left in 2012. It also seems to have only become public 9 months before the next election, so they may have considered it a pointless move to withdraw from the coalition on such a matter, if they considered it at all.

As for the matter of cable tapping, and the rest of the surveillance programmes - I would find it hard to condone their involvement in a government which took such actions, but I do to some extent sympathize with them. Either they could have taken a principled stand and left government on an issue that would unfortunately leave the majority of the public somewhat confused, and bemused, or they could stay, and continue to wield some minor influence in other legislative matters. It comes back to the perennial problem of compromise in politics, and whilst I can't say I would have done the same thing myself (or that I generally approve of it), I can understand why they did it.",2015-09-15 15:35:45+00:00,cv2ey7l,3.0,t1_cv2dcdh,2610.0,BritishPolitics
196,"I will try and write up a longer reply to this later, but I'll summarize a few points now.

1. You certainly raise some fair points about certain actions of theirs in government (voting for the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 and section 44 of the Serious Crime Act 2015, for example), which I certainly disapprove of. However, I would disagree that they went and voted for 'an Act that does the exact same thing, but under a different name'. Also, both your links to publicwhip.org.uk seem to be broken, so if you could amend this, that would be great - I'd like to have a look.

2. I think you may be somewhat overestimating the power and political capital that the Lib Dems had as a junior partner in the coalition, particularly with regards to removing legislation passed by previous governments and the actions of GCHQ. Whilst in government, they had to compromise and pick their battles wisely, otherwise the coalition would have quickly developed into a crisis and the likely outcome is they would have left government. As someone who holds liberal principles it is also an annoyance to me that they had to compromise on such issues, but unfortunately it is the reality of the situation, and the Lib Dems did not have the power to act in so unilateral a fashion. I also don't think it's entirely fair to blame the Lib Dems for the American surveillance programs which were completely out of their power [edit: on a reread I understand this was not your intent, so I will add this in case people do not read the whole comment chain] - although the coalition government is clearly complicit through their cooperation at the time.

3. I think it is a fair assumption that the majority of Lib Dem MPs  - in fact, the majority of parliament -  did not actually know about the vast majority of the surveillance programs revealed by the leaks until the general public did (which renders it worse for being not just an affront to liberal values but also an affront to democracy), and even then it's entirely possible that MPs (albeit, at this point, at fault) were still not aware of the extent of these programs  - they may have read the papers and been made aware of PRISM and Tempora, but there was much that never became as publicly known as the initial leaks, and I find to this day that many people I talk to about these matters are still entirely unaware of programs such as JTRIG.

&gt; I don’t know which is worse: you knew about GCHQ and NSA’s activities, and either weren’t able to do anything about it (as a party), or you supported them, or you didn’t know.

So, in order - it was the third (for most MPs), then the first, with a smidgeon of the second all the way through (but moreso for the leadership of the party). I also find their behaviour lacking, but I think you perhaps overstate the case for how much they could have done.",2015-09-15 14:17:40+00:00,cv2c4rp,1.0,t3_3l1g3g,3081.0,BritishPolitics

Davis seems to be the most prominent Tory rebel and the most likely to rally other like-minded Tories to his cause, so whilst this vote was not particularly exciting, the third reading may be, if the bill goes through the committee stage largely unamended.

203,"It appears the point of Cameron's speech got lost because of the ill-judged jibe at us Yorkshire folk. Here were a few bits I found interesting:

&gt; Among the reforms would be a new commitment to revamp social services and child protection provision, with local authorities and charities to working closer together. Councils will be warned that, if children’s services are failing children, they could be taken over by non-profit trusts.

It appears a similiar approach ('breaking state monopolies' and 'bringing in new providers') will also be applied to prisons. And:

&gt; The efficiency drive will see legislation introduced to enable the police, fire and ambulance services to combine back-office functions, IT and procurement to save money.

Not exactly sure how that would even work, but it sounds interesting. The bit that interested me the most though, was this:

&gt; It will also push forward plans to open up government contracts to small businesses and make more efficient use of public sector land by closing down government offices and releasing areas for construction of homes.

This sounds pretty good, if it works - we do need more homes, and there have been criticisms from across the political spectrum that government contracts can end up dominated by a few large companies. One does have to wonder though, whether the current government has got it backwards - consistently cutting budgets then contracting out the work to other sectors when they begin to or continue to fail. One article linked in this article points out how cuts have already stretched a lot of the services provided, to the point where they will find it harder to implement radical reforms, and much harder to pursue further efficiencies.",2015-09-12 00:40:03+00:00,cuyjg70,1.0,t3_3km0vk,781.0,BritishPolitics

205,"A moralistic tirade about how an over-generalized group should keep 'its moral lectures to itself'. Lovely. Here is where the 'moral lectures' in this specific instance come in:

&gt; That wasn’t the reaction of quite a few other people. Over at the Stop The War Coalition, they took a short break from masterminding Jeremy Corbyn’s election campaign to post up an angry statement declaiming “UK government rides to war killing its own citizens and on the backs of refugees”. In the Guardian, Gary Younge wrote “Britain can now add extrajudicial killings to torture, rendition and occupation as tools in defence of “Enlightenment values”. The human rights group Reprieve took to the air waves to complain “the fact that David Cameron has bypassed parliament to commit these covert strikes is deeply worrying – as is his refusal to share what legal advice he was given.” 

Now, none of this seems particularly moralizing to me - Most of the arguments put forward in the three linked pieces seem to revolve around explicitly legal issues, and concern over the powers of the state. But if we take a look at a few statements in the article from Mr Hodges - 

&gt; And the moderate center-Right have happily ushered them up there. OK, this may be a legally grey area. But the practicalities of defending the realm some times supersede the principles. The end justifies the means. 

and:

&gt; But even if it wasn’t legally correct, it was morally correct. These men were Isil fighters. We know this because they told us they were. 

And: 

&gt; Stopping them from continuing their campaign of barbarism was our moral duty. 

Then, the premise of the article that 'the Left wraps itself in the warm, heavy cloak of morality', whilst implying that pro-interventionists are somehow less guilty of such an offence, and in fact not more guilty, seems entirely unfounded. He finishes the article off with this statement:

&gt; So by all means, lecture us about politics. Lecture us about foreign affairs. Lecture us about international law. But please, if you really think the killing of Reyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin was wrong, keep your moral lectures to yourself. 

None of the articles he linked from 'The Left' overly concerned themselves with explicitly moral issues. The problem is not the killing (and I haven't seen anyone argue that the deaths of these men represent a moral travesty in and of itself), but the context to the killing - the legal background, the debate over the powers the state should hold, and how accountable the state should be to the people for various actions it commits. Does nobody remember the many years of anti-interventionists being accused, in this country and the USA, of having the blood of families murdered by dictators on their hands, and of being terrorist sympathizers, for refusing to believe that western intervention was a successful way to bring about greater peace? Does anybody actually believe that those who concern themselves with issues of incoherent military strategies, the ignoring of national and international law, and limits to the power of governments consider themselves morally superior to those who hold disregard for such things in the advancement of their 'just cause', as opposed to vice versa? Obviously I would not accuse all pro-interventionists of having advanced such arguments, but in this instance that doesn't appear to do much apart from point out the obvious difference between me and Dan Hodges. The fact is that the closing paragraph to his article makes it completely evident - this is not an argument based on people's understanding of politics, foreign affairs, or international law, or even an argument that holds these things in much repute. It is a moral, and a moralizing argument, and to accuse those who oppose it of holding a 'presumption of moral superiority' is the height of disingenuousness, and the epitome of wilful ignorance with regards to applying the criticism you level at others towards yourself.",2015-09-09 23:01:42+00:00,cuw5ivj,1.0,t3_3kb0v9,3156.0,BritishPolitics

So I've been reading [The Righteous Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Righteous_Mind) recently and it has given me a few ideas for approaching this subject. Your friend may not be the most adept at expressing rationalizations for her views but it appears to me that she might not be really denying the existence of right or wrong, or refuting that any ethical question can be answered, but simply approaching the subject from a completely different set of moral intuitions - specifically, the ethic of autonomy and not the ethic of divinity ([this extract from the book](http://evokit-notes.tumblr.com/post/76829691259/shweders-three-ethics-autonomy-community) gives some concise definitions). From this ethical position the argument that 'As long as you're not hurting anyone else do whatever you want' seems much more reasonable - say, it is morally 'right' because of the fact it allows people autonomy - so it may help to bear in mind your differing positions on this fundamental matter and how that could help you better understand her position and help you explain yours to her. Ultimately though, I think it is unlikely she will change her mind on this because people's moral intuitions seem to be a very deeply set part of themselves.

&gt; What we really need is not Chilcot, but an inquiry into how we, the British educated classes (perhaps above all in my trade of journalism), are so easily talked into wars. The overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi in Libya, one of the greatest politico-socio-economic mistakes of the past 50 years, was wildly popular at the time. Those responsible face no threat of being arrested for war crimes by waiters in fashionable restaurants, as happened to Mr Blair. As for Syria, the speed with which the BBC and most commentators became convinced of the need to overthrow Bashar Al-Assad (most of them having hardly heard of him a month earlier) was astonishing. There’s a similar keenness for worse relations with Vladimir Putin, once again based on a strategic and historical grasp so feeble that it makes me, a jobbing scribbler, feel like a mixture of Metternich and Macaulay.

223,"The ""socialism"" thing definitely opens him up to criticism, but there are a few things that mitigate this somewhat. First, the attitude towards socialism (or at least people calling themselves socialist) seems to have grown less fervent amongst the general American population, since, say the '50s - I find it hard to picture a self-described socialist successfully running for public office back then, whilst now one is attempting to run for president. The second is that, the American right may have shot themselves in the foot slightly by constantly describing Obama as a socialist and a communist for the last 8 years, something which could lessen the impact of their criticism this time around (""no guys, this time he really is a socialist""). 

As for how successful Sanders may be (if he gets the nomination) - He will have a hard time due to his left-wing positions, but (apart from the above) I think there are 3 factors to bear in mind. First, he has many non-partisan/bipartisan positions and policy suggestions which are actually very popular, amongst independents and even amongst some republicans. Secondly, he is coming into a presidential race after 8 years of a Democratic presidency which (despite my disagreement with many of their policies) seems to have done a pretty OK job - not amazing, but certainly not disastrous, and without any major events that could turn the tide so drastically like the financial difficulties in 2008. And for the third, one has to factor the opposition into the calculus. The possible republican candidates range from the ridiculous (Trump), to the strictly socially conservative (Cruz, Huckabee, Walker), to the incredibly bland moderates (Rubio, Kasich), to potential electoral toxic, namely Bush. I find it pretty difficult to see any of these capturing the imagination of the American electorate in the way that Obama did in 2008, or successful Republican presidents like Reagan did, to an extent where they could win a decisive victory - I think it's going to be pretty damn close, regardless of the candidates on either side. So, in closing, I don't think it is as clear cut as it appears to be - sorry, went off on a bit of a ramble there..",2015-08-30 00:44:55+00:00,cuk9jgp,5.0,t1_cuk8tpd,1353.0,BritishPolitics

225,"A few niggles before we get to the meat of it:

&gt; Bernie Sanders is wowing the Democrats on a platform that wouldn’t carry more than a handful of states. 

This doesn't make any sense. Most of the states are sown up as Democrat or Republican anyways, regardless of the candidate, the entire election is based around a handful of swing states, and [there's a certain amount of evidence](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/07/22/poll-crucial-swing-states-shows-sanders-electable-clinton.html) Sanders might actually do better than Clinton in some swing states, and many of his ideas have [wide bipartisan support](http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/why-surprising-numbers-republicans-have-been-voting-bernie-sanders-vermont). It's unlikely he will win the candidacy and then go on to become president, but it is not impossible (or even incredibly unlikely), and the comment about 'a handful of states' makes little sense, so this seems to me to be a painfully bad misreading of the mechanics of the US presidential system.

&gt; The former Greek prime minister led in the polls on a bailout programme significantly harsher than that of the government he put out of office precisely on the issue of the bailout. 

How much of this was actually due to Syriza and their supposed ideological flaws or incompetence, and how much was due to the breakdown in negotiations between Syriza and the ECB, and the alleged machinations of institutions and leaders in Europe to try and remove Syriza from power? [There's](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/6/germany-is-bluffing-on-greece.html) some [amount](http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2015/07/yanis-varoufakis-full-transcript-our-battle-save-greece) of [evidence](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/01/syriza-cave-in-elites-regime-change), and it is the [opinion](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/opinion/paul-krugman-greece-over-the-brink.html?_r=0) of various different people in the media, that the latter should shoulder a large proportion of the blame here. I wouldn't expect Blair to criticize european institutions, but once again, it looks to me like a bad misreading of the situation, which brings us to the main point here:

&gt; There is a politics of parallel reality going on, in which reason is an irritation, evidence a distraction, emotional impact is king and the only thing that counts is feeling good about it all.

Blair can certainly state this in a newspaper, but stating it doesn't make it true, and pretending to be on the side of 'reason and evidence' and not 'emotional impact' does not mean you actually are. The general thrust of the article (that the evidence shows corbyn could probably not win a general election) seems to me to be roughly correct, but when it is couched in the misreading of such evidence and the application of flawed reasoning, it seems likely the author is attempting to do something other than expressing a fair, informed opinion. For example:

&gt; I have analysed all the different published polling and focus group evidence about Labour’s defeat, most recently the one by the BBC’s Newsnight and the one by Jon Cruddas. They all say the same. Labour lost because it was considered anti-business and too left; because people feared Ed in Downing Street with SNP support; and because he didn’t have a credible deficit reduction plan. They didn’t vote Tory because they thought he was “austerity-lite” but on the contrary because he didn’t seem committed enough to tough economic decisions.

Obviously without a lot of the facts he purports to be using here it is somewhat hard to reach a conclusion, but if you take the [article by Cruddas](http://labourlist.org/2015/08/labour-lost-because-voters-believed-it-was-anti-austerity/) (and put aside the criticisms about it being based on leading questions) it does not back up the assertion that labour lost because they were considered 'anti-business and too left', but it does back up the assertion that the public did not think they had a credible deficit reduction plan - or rather, they perceived them as 'anti-austerity' altogether. His analysis suggests they lost because of the public perception of their attitude towards austerity. One thing in the analysis by Cruddas that points to the falsity of the assertion that they were 'too left' is this:

&gt; In case people doubt the validity of this finding, we also asked people to agree or disagree with a number of other statements relating to the economy. 43 per cent agree that, ‘I am most likely to vote for the political party that redistributes wealth from rich to poor’, against 22% who do not.

and:

&gt;  60 per cent agree with the statement, ‘the economic system in this country unfairly favours powerful interests’. This rises to 73% amongst UKIP voters and 78% amongst Labour voters.

The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that a certain part of the electorate did not think that Labour had a credible plan for the redistribution of wealth, or for bringing about a fairer economic system, which hints that Blair's disbelief in the statement 'Ed Miliband lost in May not because he was too left wing but because he was not too anything' may perhaps be somewhat misguided.

&gt; If you’re angry about welfare cuts, then two things are obvious: those are cuts to programmes Labour introduced, and we only introduced them by being in power. So it is completely illogical to oppose them without understanding how best to get back into power, since in opposition we can do nothing. Someone else said to me: “If you’re writing something again, don’t blah on about winning elections; it really offends them.” It would actually be quite funny if it weren’t tragic.

This makes no sense, if you take the full thread of reasoning. If you’re angry about welfare cuts (or cuts in general, which many of Corbyn's supporters also are), then you should want a government in power to stop them. How do you get a government in power? By saying you will match cuts in government expenditure. So you should sacrifice the cause you want to be in power for, to get in power. It raises a dilemma for those who want to continue or increase rates of government expenditure, but the solution provided by Blair is utterly inept at fulfilling the political desires of these people. One could attempt to find a middle ground, but as we can see from the Miliband campaign (the first labour leader, as he put it in the TV debates, to advocate cutting government expenditure during a general election for many decades) this is not a successful option. Putting aside the last few paragraphs, rambling smugness about how people who hold these views live in a hermetic bubble, you reach the end of the article and realize that Blair has attempted to prove 'Jeremy Corbyn’s politics are fantasy' without actually mentioning Jeremy Corbyn’s politics, at all. Not one criticism of policy suggestions, no analysis of polls on the popularity of Corbyn's views, not even a mention of the man's actual views - As Blair notes,

&gt; Because it is a vast wave of feeling against the unfairness of globalisation, against elites, against the humdrum navigation of decision-making in an imperfect world, it persuades itself that it has a monopoly on authenticity. 

One cannot help but think that they have a fair point, when the argument presented here is utterly devoid of any glimmer of authenticity, and appears to unwittingly be an argument against authenticity itself.",2015-08-29 22:57:42+00:00,cuk66ca,1.0,t3_3ivz0i,5308.0,BritishPolitics

&gt; To put it bluntly there is no issue with a pay gap between genders, the real issue is the pay gap between bottom level workers and CEOs. This isn't a gender issue but a class issue imo.

I would agree with this point but I still think it is more nuanced, and that it is not an either/or problem. There is certainly an issue with pay gap between the bottom level workers and the CEOs, and there does appear to be some inequalities between genders when it comes to pay when age is a factor in the equation, and possibly not just because of biological reasons. But this does not mean that either should be ignored, or not given our full scrutiny - both class and gender issues which still exist should be paid attention to. From the data I have seen though, the issue concerning class, or disparity of wages between different levels of employees, is much more pronounced than that of gender, and very little is being done to counteract this issue.",2015-08-29 02:27:03+00:00,cujczmc,4.0,t1_cujci67,1033.0,BritishPolitics

&gt; He found that UKIP challenged Labour “in our traditional heartlands”, with 63 of the 100 seats where UKIP made their greatest inroads in Labour constituencies.

Now, I've had a look at a bunch of these constituencies and it appears to be that UKIP are coming close in these safe seats to replacing the Tories as the main opposition to Labour - Similiar to how UKIP are replacing Labour as the main opposition in some south and south-east constituencies. The other interesting part was this:

&gt; “There was a UKIP swing of 10% or greater in more than a third of the 106 key marginals that Labour was targeting in order to form a government,” his report states.

This is very interesting, because it implies that the growth in UKIP votes may decide who wins marginal constituency battles in the next election, and there has been some data that [ suggests it may already have handed seats to the Tories in the last general election.](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/09/ukip-tory-tories-election)

But, the situation flips again in their 30s when men tend to land most senior well-paid positions — suggesting that there is a “drop-off point” in women’s careers after which they have to play catch up.

I mainly posted it because of the pretty eye-catching statistic about the fall in wages for teenage girls, but it does seem to raise some other important points, such as there is a certain amount of evidence that older women are somewhat at a disadvantage in the job market compared to other categories of employees. For example, what I quoted above and the quote that 'despite the Equal Pay Act being introduced 40 years ago female managers earn around 22 per cent less than their male counterparts' - does the huge amount of information you have provide a counterargument to this point?

&gt; Not to mention that the population is becoming increasingly focused on the leadership rather than the rest of the party. Are we going to see unstable local politics as people vote for the leadership they want instead of their preferred local candidate?

I think this would be somewhat mitigated by the nature of the issues and the connection between the issues and the voter, that arise from being more local. This problem on the focus of the leadership, to me, stems from how incomprehensible some of the national issues can seem to the average voter, and the intense media focus upon specific personalities in politics.

&gt; The Foreign Office, the German Foreign Ministry and everybody else would get together and invent a series of bilateral deals and virtually reconstruct the relationship.

257,"&gt; But the big problem with Corbyn’s policy is his approach to taxation, public spending and borrowing. He thinks that in 2020, when the government books will probably be in surplus, the government should tax, spend and borrow more on a vast scale. 

To be more precise, he wants to tax and spend more (something I obviously found incredibly surprising in a Labour leadership candidate..), but he wants to borrow only for investment in infrastructure [well, not exactly - see further down]. I think this should probably be stressed more, as it's a completely legitimate thing to do. He also thinks that we should stay in surplus in 2020 - this article doesn't outright state that he doesn't, but it does imply it, somewhat dishonestly.

259,"&gt; Paul Eisen, a self-professed Holocaust denier, claims close association with Corbyn over several years and even that Corbyn has donated to his work. When confronted by the Daily Mail last week, Corbyn’s spokesman condemned Eisen’s views, but declined to comment on Eisen’s claims that Corbyn has attended “every single” one of his events and donated towards his work.

This is a rather worrying claim. However it should be noted that the events that Corbyn attended were not connected to holocaust denial, they were events of the group Deir Yassin Remembered, described by the daily mail as an anti-Israel pressure group.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; In February, the reverend Stephen Sizer, was ordered by the Church of England to stop using social media after posting an antisemitic conspiracy myth that Israel planned 9/11. While the Church said the material Sizer posted was “clearly antisemitic”, on Sunday the Mail revealed that Corbyn wrote to the Church defending Sizer, saying that he was being victimised because he “dared to speak out against Zionism”.

It's not clear whether the material that Sizer reposted on facebook was antisemitic or merely anti-Israel (putting aside the matter that it is clearly ridiculous) - the two are obviously not equivalent. I am led to believe [this is the article](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/9-11/Israel_did_it) in question, but I have not had the time to read through it to check if there is indeed any antisemitism in the article.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; In April 2012, Corbyn warmly praised Ra’ed Salah, a prolific antisemite who claims that Israel planned 9/11 and who has, according to the Court of Appeal, even promoted the antisemitic blood libel that Jews bake bread using the blood of non-Jewish children. Yet Corbyn has said “Salah’s is a voice that must be heard” and publicly told Salah: “I look forward to giving you tea on the terrace because you deserve it!”

This is also a worrying claim, and the most damaging in my view.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; In July, the Telegraph revealed that Corbyn has accepted thousands of pounds in gifts from organisations closely-related to Hamas.

The organisations in question are Interpal and the PRC (Palestinian Return Centre). The PRC has been granted NGO consultative status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and has initiated a lawsuit against the Israeli government for claims that it 'had “known links to terrorism” and was “affiliated to Hamas.”'. On Interpal, according to wikipedia:

&gt; The US government has made allegations that Interpal is funding or supporting terrorism, but these have not been substantiated in the British courts or by the Charity Commission.

262,"&gt; But as the former law lord Lord Hoffmann has said, [the ECtHR] seems ""unable to resist the temptation to aggrandise its jurisdiction and to impose uniform laws on member states...it considers itself the equivalent of the Supreme Court of the USA, laying down a federal law for Europe."" 

This statement just straight up annoyed me, mainly because of the hyperbole. An attempt at non-uniform application would result in a bizarre system with unworkable case law, the [four ECtHR attempts to lift the UK's ban on prisoner voting](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31356895) shows it is clearly not within the power of the court to impose in such a way anyways, and there are so many serious differences between the ECtHR and SCOTUS that any such equivalence just looks absurd. To purport that the ECtHR considers itself to be passing judgements based on a completely different type of legal document, in a completely different system of law, over a completely different type of political entity is clearly absurd, so the purpose of this statement appears to me to not be to communicate the ECtHR's own opinion of it's role and function, but at best to communicate the flawed opinion of the person speaking, and at worst to scaremonger, and misrepresent the ECtHR and it's powers.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Perhaps the most farcical and cynical aspect of the Council of Europe which gave rise to that Court is that Russia is a member state and has signed up to all the fine words about human rights. I would rather my country was not in such company. 

Guess we better leave the UN and withdraw from the ICC too, then. Aside from the humorous (though false) inference that Tebbit does not want to uphold human rights in this country to the extent they do in Russia, he should perhaps also look at the company we would keep in Europe if we withdrew from the ECHR - namely, Belarus. Either way, it is par for the course that in the international world different countries which may not find each other rather savoury still negotiate and sign treaties, trade with each other, and are members of the same supranational organizations. To pretend this is a serious argument for withdrawal is to be somewhat removed from the political reality. This also puts another nail in the coffin of the conception of the ECtHR as some malevolent, unstoppable, interfering busybody court - We have to obey it as much as Russia does. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; A new injustice has now come from the Appeal Court ruling that the detention of Serdar Mohammed, a suspected Afghan bombmaker [in Afghanistan], for 110 days without charge was illegal under that legislation..  ..It was war, and if the choice was between risking some injustice to a suspected Afghan bomb maker or risking the life of a British soldier, I know which risk I would have taken. However, Sapna Malik, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day which brought the case, called it ""upholding"" the law.

This appears to be [fairly complex](https://www.justsecurity.org/25184/reason-uk-lost-serdar-mohammed-case/) but the crux of the issue appears not to be the ECHR but the differing nature of international humanitarian law when applied to international armed conflicts and non-international armed conflicts (those against state actors, and those against non-state actors) - I am not certain but from my reading it looks like, because there is no specific international body of law for dealing with non-state actors and prisoners in these conflicts (such as the Geneva convention in IACs), they are instead subject to domestic law. Considering the current conflicts in the world it is not surprising that this is an expanding and maybe somewhat underdeveloped part of law. Also, whilst it the overall ruling was based on article 5 of the ECHR, there were numerous other legal failings involved:

&gt; The Justices conclude “even if Article 5 had to be modified to reflect the fact that this detention was in the course of a non-international armed conflict, the minimum procedural safeguards required by international law in such a conflict would not have been met.”

The Justices, as shown in the article, also pointed to a method in which similiar actions could be rendered legal in future, even with the ECHR in place. So, as with many of the cases often quoted to highlight the supposed travesties that happen due to the ECHR (and HRA), once you actually look into the details it is much more nuanced and it is not always the ECHR, but often the activities of governments and other relevant law from which faults arise. Unfortunately he failed to provide the case names for the 'violent foreign sex offenders and other undesirables being granted the right to live in our country on the most absurd grounds', and whilst I'm sure there have been a few egregious errors of judgements at the hands of both the british and european courts regarding these issues, I'm not entirely convinced this presents a reasonable case for removing the HRA or withdrawing from the ECHR.

&amp;nbsp;

Not sure what the point he's making about judicial review is. The article he links is about Chris Grayling making the rules for obtaining a judicial review harder, two years ago, which is completely unrelated to the paragraphs he wrote about judicial review.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Even worse, I doubt if Mr Cameron, who unwisely made himself something of a lame duck prime minister by the premature announcement of his decision to stand down before the next election, will have the authority lead us out of the reach of the Strasbourg Court by renouncing the European Convention. 

So, if I had one point about this article of which I approve, it is the fact that he does not dither about like many in the government pretending that if he remove the HRA alone we won't have to worry about the ECHR/ECtHR, or if we remove the HRA alone it will be handing power in some way back to the British. All removing the HRA would do (aside from possibly causing a raft of constitutional issues) is remove powers from British judges - both to rule on human rights cases, which would go back to Strasbourg (possibly amounting in the waste of government official's time and money), and to issue the (already extremely weak) obligation which British courts can place upon parliament. The idea that the British state, in the modern day, should have a judiciary which is completely unable to restrict (or even declare incompatible) any and all legislation which can be passed through parliament is one I find rather disquieting and quite out of keeping with the norm in other developed countries. However, the idea that a judiciary which can barely do this is 'out of control' - now, I simply find that nonsensical.

267,"So in my view, this is more a good thing, and I especially don't view it as such a terrible thing, like the Breitbart writer seems to. However we don't want to get into the situation where we are paying out an unsustainable amount of subsidies on any particular one technology, so when the DECC says:

&gt; The Government does not earmark budget for any specific technology. Instead, the Government wishes to develop a mixture of renewable energy technologies.

This worries me somewhat. Either the answer is a fudge because they don't really want to say, or we have an inadequate system in place for budgeting renewable energy technologies, because without a clear understanding of the expense and profitability of various ventures I fail to see how we can develop a coherent renewable energy strategy for the future. Maybe it is possible to do so without a specifically demarcated budget, but I certainly can't see it making the task any easier, and it is already a very contentious policy issue.

a sidenote is that, whilst I have no way of verifying the numbers cited from data provided by the Renewable Energy Foundation and I will accept them in good faith as accurate, the organization has [come under criticism before for having an 'anti-wind agenda'](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/may/18/renewable-energy-foundation-wind-farm) - now I'm not entirely certain myself whether these criticisms are legitimate but it's worth bearing in mind.",2015-08-08 17:08:03+00:00,ctw1la9,1.0,t3_3g9ai9,1330.0,BritishPolitics
268,"&gt; ..in the late 1980s and early 1990s, rumours sometimes swirled: the names of various senior politicians were whispered in connection with alleged sexual abuse of children..  And in all my time there, working as private secretary to Sir Edward Heath, I never once heard his name mentioned in this context.

Is this really so surprising? If rumours were swirling around Whitehall about Heath, it's perfectly possible that a private secretary to the man would not be made privy to these rumours, especially if people understood him to be loyal to Heath.

&gt; By the time I was working for Sir Edward (1988-1992), he no longer sailed, but part of my job was to arrange reunions of former crew members. They were a tight-knit group from a wide variety of backgrounds, with a close camaraderie and used to living at close quarters on board. Had Sir Edward jumped ship once in Jersey for a couple of hours to get up to no good, they would have noticed his absence. The whole idea is inconceivable. 

Frankly, it is this argument which I find inconceivable. A tight-knit group of friends and acquaintances, at least one of whom was at some point involved at a high level of government, protecting each other from the law? It's perfectly conceivable.

&gt; The same is true of some of the other allegations aired this week, which cover the period after 1965 when he became Leader of the Opposition.. He would have had a government driver and, from 1970 when he was elected as Prime Minister, would also have had Special Branch officers with him at all times, right up to his death in 2005. 

Given several recent disclosures surrounding similar cases, I'm not entirely convinced that Special Branch, at the time, were a trustworthy organization.

Disregarding these specific issues with the article, I'd like to touch on a broader point - that of, as the article says, 'What has happened to the principle of innocent until proven guilty?'
Now, there are a few distinctions to be made here; there is accepting and believing Heath was guilty of these offences before the public has been presented with any real evidence or judgement, there is 'the principle of innocence until proven guilty', and there is dismissing the accusations out of hand before the public has been presented with any real evidence or judgement. Depending on the outcome, the first and last options could be just as incorrect or damaging as each other, and I feel it is important to stress that it is duplicitous to conflate the principle of innocence until proven guilty with the last option. I have also seen a fair few articles in the media adopting the last position over the last few days, which strikes me as rather too rash - If I was a columnist, I certainly wouldn't be risking my reputation by making such statements at such a time.",2015-08-08 13:23:39+00:00,ctvviej,1.0,t3_3g8n2l,1653.0,BritishPolitics
269,"There are various important points raised in this article, but the one I want to focus on is the efficacy of 'stop and searches' in general, and how government policy could improve the efficacy of this power. I am rarely one to agree with the conservatives on most things, and especially not Theresa May, but I think she has carried out a very good reformation of this police power in London, as outlined in this [conservativehome.com article.](http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2015/05/reasons-to-be-tory-10-theresa-mays-stop-and-search-reforms.html) To quote the relevant passage:

&gt; The rate in London, where most stop and searches take place, was in between: eight per cent. ..The police guidance for stop and search was changed and a target set: that 20 per cent of stop and searches in London should result in an arrest or drugs warning.  The number of stop and searches then fell from 500,000 to 350,000 – but the arrest rate rose to 18 per cent.

This indicates a 30% reduction in the use of stop and searches, and a 10% percentage point (a 125% increase) in successful arrests. It is hard to say whether adopting this policy (with the current 20% success rate in Yorkshire) would result in large improvements or only minor improvements, but either way I think it is a matter worthy of consideration.",2015-08-06 23:16:44+00:00,ctu6m9r,1.0,t3_3g1v26,8249.0,YorkshirePolitics

It is my honest opinion that without this working class movement the Labour party will never rediscover it's fundamental purpose, and will only be able to define itself in the media as 'slightly different from the tories', especially after the Blair years, and the policies adopted by the Cameron government to alter the ground on social wedge issues such as gay rights and minority rights.

292,"Yes, very much - I feel like typing so I may as well expand upon my point, and the ones you have raised. On the point of Germany, many regard the response of the German administration to the spying scandals as a bit of a song and dance, whilst the administration continues to fully cooperate. However the German people are not having a song and dance, and there is no guarantee that the current administration, or an administration with the same policies as the current one, will continue in the future. Whilst Germany is certainly one of the most powerful members of the EU, it is worth remembering that it is one state out of 28, and it's population is 80.6 million out of 503 million - and without the agreement of other member states and the democratic support of a majority of the people, the USA will not find it easy to establish new trade deals (such as TTIP or TiSA). Since the 2000s international relations between the USA and France have been somewhat warmer, but there is no guarantee that this will continue*, and without the soft power exerted by Germany, France and the UK upon the rest of the EU the USA will not, in my opinion, find it easy to have a whole lot of influence in the EU at all. The UK seems to me to be the most consistently pro-USA country out of this western european bloc of three, and with our exit from the EU, I imagine the USA will find itself in a more precarious position concerning europe than is perhaps immediately apparent.

*To talk further on this, what really seems to matter in this regard is the French attitude towards the current regional conflict in the middle east and, more specifically, their attitude towards ISIS/Daesh. They are participating in air-strikes in Iraq against them, but the French government has already ruled out doing the same in Syria. As of now, the general strategy (if it can be called a strategy) of the forces involved in the war against ISIS/Daesh is to have western coalition forces and iranian forces cooperating with the Iraqi military inside Iraq, and for the US to lead a coalition of different countries from the region, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, etc to perform airstrikes in Syria ([this article](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/inherent-resolve.htm) is a helpful guide to the current operation), excepting things such as the recent disclosures about UK pilots embedded in US forces performing airstrikes in Syria. As I previously implied, I have rather serious doubts about whether the current state of operations there can be considered an actual strategy, and it is my opinion that the actual strategy for defeating ISIS/Daesh will be revealed sometime after the US presidential election - and indeed, it will probably include the goal of eliminating the Assad regime as well, if it does not deviate from the goal held several years ago by the US, the UK, and Saudi Arabia. It is at this point - and forgive me for the rather lengthy exposition - that France, along with other countries, will have to make a decision as to whether it favours a stronger pro-interventionist approach, or whether it favours the same as it did during the Iraq war. My immediate suspicion would be that they would take a similiar approach to the Iraq war, and this would again lead to a similiar souring of relations between the US and French administrations - however, this is not definite by any measure, and the terrorist attacks in France could certainly exacerbate any pro-interventionist feelings the current administration may have. The alternative to this scenario is that the next american administration does not favour a more pro-interventionist strategy in the middle east, which is certainly possible, but which I consider rather unlikely.

EDIT: several minor edits. Also, to lend some weight to my comments on the strategy against ISIS/Daesh, this is not just my view but also the view of various journalists from all sides of the political spectrum, Obama himself, and the view of the last government's own defence select committee, as shown in the seventh report on 'The situation in Iraq and Syria and the response to al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq al-Sham (DAESH)', delivered on 27 January 2015.

306,"Also from Wikipedia -

&gt; Equally, ""Social democracy"" has also come to be defined as a political ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a capitalist economy, and a policy regime involving welfare state provisions, collective bargaining arrangements, regulation of the economy in the general interest, interventions to promote greater equality in the distribution of income and wealth, and a commitment to representative democracy.

This is the definition which fits Jeremy Corbyn, in my opinion - mainly because the beliefs and positions he has espoused fall within this definition. I also find the application of the first definition of the term to Jeremy Corbyn troublesome for various reasons - firstly, there are different arguments (stemming mainly from revolutionary socialists) that the goals set in the second definition are fundamentally incompatible with establishing an actual socialist society, although admittedly this is more a problem with the definition itself than the application of the definition to Corbyn. Secondly, that in various speeches of Corbyn I have heard ([this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK36ps3L-aU) is one example) what he specifically calls 'socialism', or the 'socialism' he espouses, falls very much under the second definition. At this point, the definition of socialism might come in handy, and because we've been using wikipedia, I imagine it is fair for me to continue to do so -

&gt; Socialism is a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy.

 Now, let's contrast this to a quote from Corbyn in that video: ""We want a state which takes responsibility, a community that takes responsibility for everybody, that makes sure nobody is destitute. We each care for all, everyone caring for everybody else. I think it's called socialism."" With no specific mention of the conditions upon the ownership of the means of production, I find it difficult to believe that the 'socialism' he believes in fits the standard dictionary definition, or the 'social democracy' to mean the first definition. Taking into account this quote, the rest of his speech, and also, as a further example, [this speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZvAvNJL-gE) titled 'Socialism DOES Work' delivered at the oxford union, I think it is clearly evident (or at least it is to me) that Jeremy Corbyn is a social democrat of the second definition and not the first.",2015-07-22 23:35:28+00:00,ctcqnkc,5.0,t1_ctcot99,3041.0,ukpolitics

308,"1. Probably a somewhat finicky point, but neither Syriza or Sanders are advocating the implementation of actual socialist policies, but rather social democratic policies in a capitalist economy.

2. The problems faced by the USA are fundamentally incomparable to those faced by Greece over the last 5-6 years - It has not suffered from such terrible economic mismanagement by previous governments, it has not been frantically trying to keep it's economy afloat with foreign bailouts, it doesn't have anywhere near as bad a problem concerning systemic tax avoidance/evasion, it has a proportionally smaller and more sustainable public sector, and it is a much larger, richer country in a more stable economic position.

3. Many of the continuing problems in Greece exist because of the deadlock between Syriza and the ECB, the IMF, the Eurogroup representatives, et al. There seems to me to be very little chance of the USA ending up in a similar situation, due to the incredible political capital the USA can bring to bear in international negotiations compared to Greece, and the fact that the USA is currently much less subservient to international organizations than Greece finds itself to be. 

2. The USA has control over it's own monetary policy, unlike Greece, which lends a lot of flexibility in and of itself - and the bailouts to Greece and the debt that it holds are really a drop in the ocean compared to the amounts of money that the US political system has to deal with. It's currency is also the world's reserve currency - there are many more people who have a vested interest in the financial success of the USA than Greece.

These are the reasons I can think of, off the top of my head. I'll finish off by saying that a take on events which attempts to draw a comparison between the events in Greece and what Sanders advocates is never going to be anything more than simplistic, and a more serious analysis of the economic circumstances of both countries will show that this is little more than equivocating on labels because both Syriza and Sanders consider themselves socialists or social democrats.",2015-07-13 23:34:00+00:00,ct2az5v,1.0,t3_3d6p79,1230.0,SandersForPresident

311,"I have a few points to make, but they appear to me to be tangential to the main thrust of your post and should perhaps be considered as such.

&gt; Could Eastern Europe suffer such a ""brain drain"" that it descends into civil war, driven by poverty and famine?

Brain drain can (and will) be a [problem](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/24/britain-east-europe-brain-drain-bulgaria) (link provided as one example) for these countries, and whilst I can certainly see it having detrimental economic effects (although it is worth pointing out, just as a sidenote, that Poland seems to have done rather well during and since the global financial crisis), and exacerbating the existing poverty that persists in these countries, I personally can't see it leading to such instability as conflict or a civil war - or I would say it is the least likely case. One has to consider that many of these countries suffered as part of the eastern bloc, the 'revolutions of 1989' and other events associated with the fall of communism, and the unstable transitionary period from communism to capitalism. These all brought radical economic and societal changes but throughout these events, after WW2, there was markedly little conflict - so I see no overwhelming reason to believe that conflict would result from detrimental economic effects caused by mass migration from these countries in recent years. The main exception to this, of course, is the Yugoslav wars, but my view on this is it was largely caused by political factors concerning Yugoslavia, and not economic factors. However this part of europe is certainly not something I am an expert on, so any criticisms of my interpretation of events is more than welcome.

&gt; Surely Putin, if he's still around by then, would use that opportunity to expand his empire as we've seen in Ukraine?

Putin taking such an action would be complicated (the verb, not the adjective) for various reasons. The most pressing of these is that nearly all of the countries he could exploit in such a manner would be members of NATO, which Ukraine was not. The two exceptions to this are Belarus and Moldova, who are also not members of the EU anyways. My feeling on this is that Putin (taking into consideration Farage's respect for him as a savvy national leader) is a realist, and whilst he excels at the type of political brinkmanship displayed so well in the Ukraine, he would consider equivalent actions against a member of the EU and/or NATO to be an entirely different ballgame. 

&gt; What about Turkey? It shares a large border with Syria. They've applied to join the EU, but they're not exactly a model of tolerance and peace. Recently they've become the primary gateway for extremists to join ISIS.

Personally I don't see it as likely that Turkey will join the EU. It has been 28 years since their 'application to accede' to the EEC, 10 years since their application to join the EU, support for joining the EU in Turkey has dropped massively, there are many questionable aspects of Turkey's body politic (which make it less likely they will fit the criteria for joining the EU), and this body politic itself seems to be shifting towards the view that joining the EU is, if not contrary to their goals, at least a low priority for them.

Frankly, I have no problem with this. A party in government implementing policies of other parties which it thinks are good policies is not a bad thing, it is in fact a rather good thing. It shows a much more reasonable approach to legislation than if they had refused to implement policies they thought were good, just because an opposing party suggested them.

314,"Two points -

In this case, a precedent would not be set because the caution was given by the police on the condition that further court action would be dropped and as far as I am aware only court decisions can set a legal precedent.

Now disregarding this fact, I am not a legal expert, so this might not be completely correct, but still - As I understand it when it comes to sentencing, precedent tends to take a backseat to sentencing guidelines and judicial discretion, because there are many aggravating and mitigating factors as well as other individual circumstances which prevent two cases ever being identical the majority of the time, so the system is designed to be flexible enough for the judge to consider each case individually without being hampered by strict guidelines. Another reason why putting forward such an argument may not work is that precedent is only binding on a court if it comes from a higher court in the heirarchy - say, a court of appeal, the supreme court, etc. So a case where a sentence was judged to be too harsh by a higher court of appeal would be accepted as precedent and taken into consideration during sentencing if the case before the court is sufficiently similiar, but a sentence handed down in an equivalent court may not - although it may still be taken into account. I think however that due to many sentences being decided largely based upon the individual circumstances of the case and the sentencing guidelines for many years now, it may practically have little effect on the outcome of the sentencing.

Kingsize if they are around, if not, an L, or a straight 2-paper joint (lick a third skin, apply it to the end of one paper and then pull it off to provide the necessary adhesive to stick two together straight), or if I fancy something a bit thicker I'll make a straight 2-paper deck, add 2 more skins to double the width, and then trim it into a rectangular trapezoid shape - and if there's enough people and ample smokeable material, both of these methods are applicable with king skins too. If I am on my own though, I often find i prefer rolling a regular cig size (though coned) and smoking slightly more often. 

edit: also, I like to backroll when I can, but it gets harder as the joints get larger and I'm not great at it yet. And I tend to forget once I'm high.

I honestly don't understand how people can smoke it pure unless they have a ridiculous tolerance, because even when I smoked every day I'd find a pure joint would wipe me out to the point of being unfinishable - also I think it burns in a stable fashion and gets a nice, tight finish when you roll with tobacco. And I think it tastes nicer with smoother smoke, but this is of course a subjective thing. I couldn't say as for ratio, and it tends to change depending upon the strength of the weed in question - I think I've developed a good enough heuristic by now to be sure how much to put in to get everyone high. For the last question - a nice, firm, smooth cone, of course. ",2015-06-26 02:11:04+00:00,csiz4ow,1.0,t3_3b57vi,997.0,uktrees
318,"&gt; No political movement is entirely homogeneous or harmonious - even UKIP has been subject to some much media-inflated internal conflicts - but that does not mean that the movement does not exist. Leftism exists despite its internal conflicts, and ideological inconsistencies. Most leftists are not remotely intelligent enough to untangle the complicated mishmash of left wing theories and their conceptual roots, instead what remains is a distiller essence of leftism, a simplified ""four legs good, two legs bad"" mentality congruent with the left's general us-vs them conflict based thinking.

There is quite a distinct difference between UKIP, and the entirety of the UK left. UKIP is a political party, albeit one made of up of various political movements which I consider ideologically disparate, and the UK left is at least 3 major parties, many more minor parties, and many people unaffiliated to a party at all. The latter statements I will disregard because casting aspersions upon the intellect of wide and diverse groups of people (at least, without statistical evidence), is not something I wish to engage in.

&gt; Yes, there may be the rare sophisticated leftist, that disagrees with aspects of Marxism and feminism, concedes that the free market has its merits, and honestly recognises the horror of soviet communism, but these are the exception, not the norm. 

They aren't though, are they? The vast majority of Lib Dem and Labour politicans recognize the merits of free markets (insofar as markets can be free within the modern political framework) almost as much as the major right-wing parties do (although Lib Dems moreso), and presumably a majority of the people who vote for them do also, and the majority of left-leaning people in this country share almost nothing in common with the specific ideology that led to such suffering in the USSR and other such communist states in the 20th century.

&gt; Most leftists lack any subtly whatsoever, such that ""eat the rich"" is an acceptable banner to be waved at leftist marches.

Yet more aspersions, in which case I will at least refer you to previous statements made by myself on the prefacing of various words by other various words.

&gt; I'm afraid, despite your verbosity, it's clear you are only attempting to deflect any criticism from Leftism, by claiming leftism itself does not really exist, since it's too diverse and varied to be pinned down to anything concrete. An act of sophistry, no less, to deny the Left has failed the UK in any way whatsoever, because there is no such thing as the Left. If you wish to argue that, then you have to accept that by the same argument it can be argued that the Left has achieved nothing beneficial either! 

This is not what I am claiming at all, but it does come somewhat close to the root of my argument so I am glad you brought it up. My point is that leftism is a  very diverse group of ideologies, so to make any concrete claims about where leftism has failed the UK, or where leftism has brought about beneficial changes in the UK, you **must necessarily make distinctions about which part of leftism you are addressing** - whether it be the 20th century organized labour movement, unionism actions under Thatcher and Major, Blairite politics and the idea of multiculturalism, or Blairite politics and the idea of foreign intervention, the identity politics and especially the identity politics of the younger internet generation in the 21st century - I believe it is necessary to distinguish between these different views and **accurately present the counterarguments to their arguments, and to address the specific mistakes which each different ideology makes or has made**. I believe I have made this viewpoint of mine perfectly clear. The only sophistic points being made currently are your points about people, their views, and what they support.

You misrepresent my argument as saying 'the Left is too diverse, subtle, nuanced and varied to be held to account for anything bad it may have caused' - my argument is that the left is too diverse, and contains such a wide segment of the population, to be directly held account for anything bad it may have caused (purportedly) as a whole - the anything bad, the mistakes, ill-advised judgements, and atrocities that the left has made or caused must be judged in the context of the specific views that led to these circumstances arising in the first place, **and the people who voted in these politicians to represent us, and these politicians** - as opposed to everyone who identifies as 'on the left'. If you take a wide enough definition of any political ideology (as I believe you do with leftism) that has actually been enacted in the real world you will undoubtedly encounter atrocities.


&gt; Clearly, by identifying with the Left, you concede it stands for something and has achieved something ""worthwhile"" that you believe in. If you think that, then you have to accept criticism of the left too. You can't have it both ways. 

Perfectly happy to do so - if you could believe it, as a leftist, I spend the majority of the time I talk about politics criticizing the left.",2015-06-25 02:25:09+00:00,cshta3x,5.0,t1_cshs1uj,2307.0,ukipparty
319,"&gt; So my argument was a straw man, you claim? Because not all leftists subscribe to every single leftist view, to the maximum degree? That in itself is a straw man argument.

I did claim your argument was a strawman, but not wholly because every leftist does not subscribe to every single leftist view, although I think that plays a big part, a lot of the time in the things you write it is not obvious that you think - correctly, of course - that leftism represents a spectrum of political views. I believe I also made the point that the ideological roots of these differences in views come from different places and times across the leftist spectrum, which also plays a big part in it. The argument is only a strawman insomuch as it challenges the idea that leftists are a homogeneous group of the population, and I don't believe that that the argument you presented, presented the left as anything other than this - feel free to expand, quoting your original statements, on why you feel I misrepresented your argument, and I will happily concede the point if I have done so. Hell, you know, even if you prefaced 'leftists' with 'dumb', I'd be perfectly happy here.

&gt; Not everyone on the left holds these opinions to the maximum possible degree - but they will lean towards holding these views, and be sympathetic, rather than hostile, towards others that hold them.

On this point I'm afraid I have to disagree. I think it's completely erroneous to claim that the vast majority of the UK left are sympathetic to communist or anarchist views, and I also think it's erroneous to claim that the majority of the UK left are largely sympathetic to radical views espoused by certain sociologists and critical theorists (those of the modern day, and those espoused in the mid-20th century) on the position, nature and treatment of groups such as women and racial or ethnic minorities in our society - these things being 'these opinions to the maximum possible degree', insofar as it is possible to categorize these types of views. There's certainly a debate to be had about exactly how disadvantaged people in these categories are in society, and there's certainly a debate to be had about how the media may influence people to be sympathetic to certain causes (from all sides of the political spectrum, and particularly a pro-state agenda), but I really don't think that there is any real ground gained by those pushing particularly radical leftist views. The majority of the population, and the majority of leftists, are (in my opinion, sensibly) rather centrist.

&gt; As to your point that leftists don't see ""straight white males"" as the enemy, I would point out that recently on the BBC, an allegedly neutral political commentator criticised the line up of party leaders as being ""too pale, male, and stale"". The point was allowed to stand, without question or criticism. But what exactly is wrong with being a white male in modern Britain? 

To directly answer the question here - it's my personal opinion that there is of course nothing wrong with being a white male in modern Britain. The BBC may have said this but it is a catchphrase that has been thrown around by the media for good or ill, and even the financial times and the telegraph have used it - hardly leftist publications. I heard a few brief debates about the subject on the Daily Politics in which people expressed a distaste for the idea insofar as the only direct ways to deal with the ""pale, male and stale"" (sorry) representation were in disagreement with meritocratic principles - I certainly wouldn't have minded a more in-depth debate on the subject, and I suspect a lot more people who identify on the left or vote for a left-leaning party would have felt the same. The underlying issue is not that there is something specifically wrong with being a white male, but that white males are proportionately overrepresented in various sectors of the economy, and in politics - now, whether or not you agree or disagree with whether they are proportionately overrepresented (and as with previous points there is a good debate to be had about this as well), the idea that it is being pointed out because people view white males as an ideological enemy and not as simply overrepresented seems to me to be stretching the argument a little bit.

Overall, the point of my comment was to simply bring in the viewpoint that the left is not homogeneous, harmonious and is often attacking itself (as I believe you have pointed out in recent posts about how we will ""eat each other alive""), and is definitely not anchored to the same ideological roots. I should now also probably add that we're not all as partisan as you imagine, which I can attest to at least on an anecdotal level - there are parts of the UKIP and Conservative manifestos which I agree with much more than recent ideas stemming from the identity politics left, or the far left.",2015-06-25 01:16:58+00:00,cshr39z,3.0,t1_cshpajq,3200.0,ukipparty
320,"I think you raise some fair points - in my comment about human rights I was mainly addressing the situation in the UK and pertaining to citizens of the UK, which I perhaps should have made more clear. I won't edit it in, but hopefully people will read on into this comment thread. On AA, I can't really say much (due to a lack of knowledge about the system) other than that my own personal political beliefs would say the poor white boy has just as much a justification to be helped by the system as someone who is disadvantaged due to any other attribute of their person or situation, especially if, as in the example you mentioned, other people have been significantly helped by their position in society.

In regards to the situation regarding human rights all over the world, I don't think it's entirely a further left or further right thing (of course, not meaning to dismiss what ideologies on both sides have done), and that governments all across the left-right spectrum can commit or be complicit in human rights abuses, especially in the case where it does not necessarily involve their own citizens. I should probably add that, in my view, the failure of this 'spectrum' to provide any really meaningful way to compare governments in such a sense is probably due to the fact that it's not actually a very meaningful way of analyzing political ideologies as a whole.",2015-06-24 22:14:29+00:00,cshkw0s,3.0,t1_cshkjfo,597.0,ukipparty
321,"&gt; Leftism: the belief in equality above all else; The belief in collectivism, not individualism: that the rights of the individual should be subservient to those of the group; the belief in collective rather than private ownership.

No real issue with the first two parts of this. The third I could accept if phrased as 'the complete freedom of the individual should be superceded by the interests of the group' - after all, the entirety of the centre left and many of those further to the left are generally in favour of human rights, which are all about certain rights of the individual not being subservient to the actions of the state, which in a democracy is generally understood to be representing the interests of the group - the group being the population of a nation. Unless, of course, you do not believe that these people are leftist? My main issue is with the last point, that all leftists believe in 'collective rather than private ownership' - if taken as an absolute, this mischaracterizes the entirety of the centre-left, and even some far-left communist types, who tend to believe in a certain amount of collective ownership and a certain amount of private ownership, to varying degrees. Taking the advocation of certain amounts of both as a means of strictly categorizing who is leftist or not seems to me to be flawed, because you then end up with Peter Hitchens (who advocates for the renationalization of the railways) and the Conservative party and UKIP (who agree that the NHS should come under collective ownership) being categorized as leftist - so the extent of collective ownership (and lack of private ownership), and the specific property which a person is advocating being collectively owned is, in my opinion, a much better measure than a simple representation of forms of ownership as a dichotomy.

&gt; Leftists always claim to champion the rights of certain so-called disadvantaged groups, whether they be ""the proletariat"" (Marxism), women (feminism), Ethnic minotities (race politics), the disabled, animals (Animal Rights), and even the environment itself (Environmentalism). 

Once again no major issue with the majority of this, apart from the inclusion of environmentalism. Whilst it's fair to say many of the other leftist ideologies you are discussing here certainly find some of their roots in marxist theory and later critical theory, and are somewhat fair to present as a 'leftism' despite the wide range of often contradicting viewpoints held within (a point of contention you seem to consider irrelevant, which I believe I've raised with you before), I think it is also fair to say that the ideological and theoretical roots of environmentalism - which is also a wide umbrella of views - are quite different from these, and whilst it often finds adherents amongst those of a leftist bent, and is opposed to actions of large corporations (which in and of itself is not necessarily left-wing, but often is), I feel it should perhaps be treated as a connected but distinct issue. This is of course anecdotal, but having lived in a national park for most of my life I have met many ardent conservationists, many working for the national park, and some are also ardent libertarians, dyed-in-the-wool rural tories, adherents of 'freemen on the land' movements, as well as the typical centre-left voters and many with no discernable political ideology whatsoever. 

&gt; Central to leftism is the perception of society through the lens of a conflict theory; Marxism depicts society as rich vs poor, feminism as women vs men, Queer theory as gays vs straights, Gender politics as trans vs cis, Environmentalism as man vs nature. Using identity politics, leftism promotes ""class consciousness"" among the so-called oppressed groups, with the intent that they unify against those that are seen to oppress them and thus fundamentally alter society. Those that belong to the ""oppressing"" class - straight, white, able bodies males - are either viewed as the enemy or, if they display the correct degree of masochistic self loathing, as half-trusted and disposable ""allies"".
To achieve their end of a uniformly equal society, leftists have to promote the idea that we are all naturally the same, and that it is only society that raises one individual above another; all notions that people can be biologically different therefore have to be demonised, ridiculed, and ignored: differences between sexes are merely attributed to ""social constructs"", as are any difference between races; competitive enterprises have to be replaced with cooperative ones in schools; mediocrity and conformity are the goals, not success and personal fulfilment.

This is certainly true of some people but I don't feel that it is true of most people who identify as on the left - the number of people who subscribe to such sociological theories and subscribe to this understanding of economic and identity politics as to consider 'straight, white, able bodied males' their enemies are not as widespread as people on the internet seem to think, possibly because of the frequent and striding airing of these radical views on the internet by the people who hold them. There are also some interesting points to be raised here - for one, 'the idea that we are all naturally the same' is the antithesis of identity politics for many people, though some may hold the view that they are completely social constructs, which points to quite an obvious distinction between the group of people who hold these views. Another, a classical marxist would not of course hold that all 'straight, white, able bodied males' are their enemy, because the majority of them were  'straight, white, able bodied males'. A vaguely unconnected point I would like to make at this point is that whilst a lot of views on the left in the UK have been influenced by Marx, and the theory that stems from Marx, a whole lot of it has been formed from the organized labour movement of the 20th century which, whilst in some ways influenced by marxists, was never wholly opposed to capitalism and took very little from the neo-marxian and post-modernist critiques of western society that eventually contributed to the formation of modern identity politics - perhaps another factor in my contention with your apparent view that the left forms some homogeneous ideology.

Another point about this here is the idea that 'notions that people can be biologically different' are summarily rejected by the left - I don't reject this, many centre-left politicians and centre-left voters don't reject this, in fact, I imagine to many working class labour voters this would appear to be an entirely absurd claim. Are we not leftists? There are a few points left that I'd like to address but I've expounded at quite a length and I've had a fair few beers, so I'll just come to my overarching point which has been made implictly evident throughout - Are people who disagree with many of these things still leftists? And are people who agree with some of these things whilst holding views that would generally be considered conservative or right-wing leftists? If people who disagree with many of these things are still leftists then it's not a fair characterization of people on the left, and is in fact little more than a strawman constructed by picking attributes from a wide collection of  often-contradicting views that are considered 'the left' and attempting to portray them as a monolithic movement, which not only does a disservice to people on the left but also the people on this and other subreddits who read and may be influenced by your words, and ultimately a disservice to yourself by trying to simplify and dichotomize the world around you - and also if people who disagree with many of these things are still leftists, then so is Peter Hitchens, so is the Conservative party and many of their voters, so is UKIP and many of their voters: ultimately reducing the meaning of the words 'leftist' and 'leftism' to very little other than just political views you happen to disagree with, which is entirely unuseful for a debate about politics, or anything.

You can certainly find individual members (or ex-members) of the party who have held views such as these but I have yet to see anything in their policies and/or their latest manifesto that could really be described as such.

5, I think it would be fair to categorize a majority of their policies as right wing or more accurately libertarian. However, many of their policies (such as the focus on direct democracy and referendums, integrating health and social care, reintroducing grammar schools, ending 'ATOS-style work capability assessments' to return the system and funding to GPs, to name a few) are not really simple enough to boil down into the typical left-right spectrum, so it's always advisable to have a closer look - and of course they support the longstanding British institutions or systems such as the welfare state (at least to a certain extent), an NHS which is free at the point of access, and so on, which in other parts of the world would appear rather left-wing.",2015-06-18 20:26:37+00:00,csb42pg,1.0,t3_3abp63,641.0,ukipparty
325,"I haven't been able to find much reliable data. This source seems to be providing general figures (for all 'racially or religiously aggravated harassment crimes' and hate crimes) and not the figures specifically relating to islam or muslims, hopefully not in an attempt to conflate the two. One thing I could find is [this](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/17/hate-crimes-against-muslims-britain-spike-jihadi-attacks-study), which records 548 incidents in 2014-15, 734 in 2013-14, and 584 in 2012-13.
