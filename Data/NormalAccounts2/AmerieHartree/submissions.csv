The programme on the BBC starts at 10:50 tonight (Thursday 30th), but feel free to drop in at any point before or after that.

IRC is a chat protocol. The normal way is to use an IRC client like [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html) (which we recommend), but you can also access the channel perfectly well using your browser, and a website such as [KiwiIRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/BritishPolitics/?settings=dd892af474749b032ba39bb88a8894d9) or [Mibbit](https://client01.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.snoonet.org&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp:channel=%23BritishPolitics). All you need to do is choose a nick and press 'Start' or 'Go'.

You can change your name at any time by just typing the ""/nick &lt;name&gt;"" command into the chat box - for example, to change your name to [""Clegg""](https://i.imgur.com/eQGwxR4.gifv) you would type

49,2016-06-25 08:34:46+00:00,self.BritishPolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/BritishPolitics/comments/4prphg/some_thoughts_on_the_implications_of_brexit/,False,"So, as we all know, the UK left the European Union. This will have far reaching implications for the nature of UK politics, so I thought it would be fun to explore some of these and also the extent to which they are uncertain, in a long, vaguely coherent ramble, and also to have a general discussion about what we have to look forward to. I've (happily) left out the economic implications, as there is to be plenty of stuff in the media about that right now, and in case of the possibility that someone more knowledgeable wants to have a crack at that.

&amp;nbsp;

First, we are almost definitely set for a long period of renegotiation. After invoking article 50, there is a 2 year period before automatic withdrawal, and this period can be extended with unanimous agreement from all member states. The conservative leadership election will be held in October, and I personally find it unlikely that article 50 will be officially invoked before the new leader takes over. Cameron seems not to have properly prepared for the possibility of a leave result, as [this article](https://constitution-unit.com/2016/05/27/post-brexit-trade-negotiations-would-pose-significant-practical-challenges-for-whitehall/) notes, so, in my view, a leadership election, a reshuffle, and the development of a capable team and a rough strategy for dealing with the negotiations will likely have to go forward before the actual procedure begins.  So, there is the possibility that the process is held up from the initial two years on the British side, but I also believe there is a possibility of hold-ups on the EU side, too. EU politicians and officials have, over the last day or so, been making many comments along the lines of, 'let's get this over with as quickly as we can', but one has to bear in mind that this is not a procedure the EU has ever used before, so this is, in a sense, a test run of whether the procedure actually turns out to be practiceable, and as the article notes, it will be 'more comprehensive than any previous EU external agreement', requiring negotiations between all 28 member states, followed by a [qualified majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_the_Council_of_the_European_Union#Treaty_of_Lisbon) vote from the Council and the consent of the EU parliament, and a further renegotiation between the remaining member states on how it affects internal EU issues afterwards (although this last will obviously not directly involve us). It seems unlikely to me that, once entered into negotiations, that either side will want to rush with undue haste through an untested procedure concerning such a complex and critically important agreement.

&amp;nbsp;

A further complexity for this, and an additional implication of Brexit, is Scotland (and possibly Northern Ireland, although that is, to the best of my knowledge, somewhat less likely). I now think it is basically inevitable, or at least much more likely, that Scotland will become independent after this result, although in the potential economic downturn it will be interesting to see whether the same arguments from the last Scottish referendum still hold the same weight, and in this and the possible impact upon the withdrawal negotiations it all revolves around the SNP's strategy for the timing of their referendum. This seems to me, to be one of the areas most rife with uncertainty. There are, as far as I'm aware, no formal mechanisms that could allow Scotland to remain part of the EU as the rest of the UK leaves, Sturgeon has said ""the Scottish government must be fully and directly involved in any and all decisions about the next steps that the UK government intends to take"", and it is likely the SNP government will be involved in the renegotiations. So the actual process of independence for Scotland looks like a long, tortuous route of sitting through the withdrawal renegotiations, winning a referendum, negotiating it's withdrawal from the UK, and then joining the EU through the traditional route. It seems possible that this could take longer than a decade. The SNP starting the process during withdrawal negotiations could have the potential to throw a big spanner in the works.

&amp;nbsp;

One more fuzzier implication, and a more positive one, is a potential re-invigoration of our national conversation. I personally feel that, disregarding the benefits or disadvantages of (sometimes partially) ceding sovereignty to the EU in their areas of competences, there has been, regarding many issues (agriculture, fishing policy, worker's rights, the environment, consumer protections, etc) an abrogation of responsibility amongst the media and the mainstream political discourse to properly analyse and discuss these issues, and generally keep people informed. Other issues, like immigration, have still been prominent, but viewed entirely through the 'do we remain in or leave the EU' lens. Obviously we don't know exactly what we will not regain sovereignty on yet, as some current EU agreements might carry on in a different form after the withdrawal negotiations, but it looks certain that we will have greater political freedom in many areas, and this will lead to a greater responsibility for our politicians and electorate, both those on the left and the right maybe having to defend arguments in the media which have been almost absent from discussion or viewed through a narrow lens at distance for many years.

&amp;nbsp;

I also expect the conversation on immigration to change. Those in the Conservative party who stood behind the EU as a scapegoat over the continuing failure of their immigration policies supposedly intended to fulfill the wishes of their voter base will find it increasingly hard to do so, and I think we will see a growing rift in the party between those who favour the economically liberal arguments about the free movement of labour and those who favour the more traditionally conservative arguments about the socially detrimental effects of large-scale immigration when it comes down to immigration policy in the Conservative party and potential disillusionment from many of their voter base if they don't live up to their promises and rhetoric. The result also has big consequences for Labour, who, in the public's eyes, might seem to have decisively lost the argument, but could possibly reinvent themselves and their policy on the issue. Being no longer as strongly associated with the EU and not having to defend the principle of freedom of movement, with a new set of policies they may never win over those strongly critical of immigration, but they could, in time, at least put themselves on an equal footing vis-a-vis immigration as a Conservative party dominated by liberals. Obviously a massive part of the conversation on immigration is UKIP, and there are huge implications now for UKIP, but I personally can't figure out what is going to happen to them.
