18,"I am neither a global warming ""sceptic"" nor ""alarmist"". I don't know how I feel about AGW because I have put startlingly little time into researching it.

However, I'd like to mention one thing which does annoy me - which perhaps is only apparent to me because of how little I've looked into AGW: 

It confounds me when people always put evolution and global warming in the same camp of being ""exceedingly obvious"" to the point of laughing at people who have yet to be convinced of AGW as if they are the fools who don't understand evolution. 

Here's the difference. Even without a shred of observational evidence or datapoints based on existing or deceased animal populations, the mechanism of natural selection can be comprehended and internalized to the extent that one would need an explanation as to why evolution *would not* take place in a given circumstance. Once properly understood in concept, it becomes a default view that then requires challenge. We can make (increasingly-less) crude simulations that can simply demonstrate the emergence-based system of evolution in many areas, and these can help people gain a more intuitive understanding of how complexity forms over time. 

AGW, on the other hand, whatever your thoughts are on its validity, is an enormous claim that is not immediately intuitive, even once you are given the ostensibly relevant parts. For me personally, my intuition is actually contradicted by AGW, as it's clear to me that the climate is a dynamic, complex system with millions of striated feedback loops that seem to act as a stabilizing and regulating force to the entire network. Not to mention, while emergence-based networks (like the climate and living ecosystems) are oftentimes easy to identify - modeling future emergent properties seems near-impossibly difficult, given the sheer number of feedback loops interacting in a myriad of ways, some of them arbitrary unto themselves, some of them nested multiple layers up in the string of feedback loops. 

Anyway, like I said earlier, I honestly have no concrete opinion on AGW - I just know that it is absolutely not on the same intuitive level as natural selection, so as an intelligent yet uninformed person - I reject the common comparison between the two.

22,"Perhaps I did. If you're just talking about having patience when friends have weak moments, then I almost fully agree. However my personal experience is that shifting my general behavior from 'helpful and selfless' to 'self-centered with panache' has been an overwhelmingly positive experience, and the change in habits made me realize that my previous behavior was many times fruitless and occasionally harmful, especially to my long-term self. In contrast, I feel that my original intentions were actually better satisfied when I didn't hold them as principles but instead extended generosity extremely conservatively, because my ability to actually act with a meaningful effect is often stronger. A really bad analogy would be putting on your own oxygen mask on first on an airplane.

I probably read too much into what you were saying, so if you like, consider it a response to people who consider selfishness, power, success, etc to be generally undesirable traits. Nothing implicitly wrong with being helpful occasionally when the person falls strongly within your own self interest (even just emotionally) but as a general principle it's masochistic. It's like moving to a big city and quickly learning to disassociate your charitable impulse for beggars. There are enough of them that the results of your empathetic behavior would compound until it becomes noticeably harmful. Anyway, not really trying to battle you - just wanted to add my point.

I accept that both of these conditions exist in me, and try not to lose sleep over it. I don't accept that weakness ought to be celebrated and strength vilified, which in my opinion is a motif of modern society. I don't accept that I have any sort of moral obligation to sacrifice my own personal experience or credibility in order to change someone else's poor behavior. I'm not a sociopath - just usually strong enough to set my emotions aside and realize that *my own conscious experience* is sort of magical and at the root of everything I have and know so I should value it highly, especially in a cultural climate that rejects selfishness.

But let's take it as given. I think that one of the worst things you could do to help an insecure person is expose him or others to the knowledge that people think that of him. The best thing would probably just be to serve as an example of strength and confidence so they can begin to emulate these features without being shamed. 

Then again, empathy would be redundant in this scenario, because that is what you ought to be doing anyway.",2015-09-09 05:48:42+00:00,cuvbvi0,6,t1_cuvbmla,734,AskReddit
33,"What exactly do you you mean by empathized in this case?

I feel like what you're saying is actually a sort of modern cultural meme, but what should I actually do if I meet someone with negative traits - feel sad emotions? Tell them or others that it's not a weak trait? Attempt to fix their problem? 

I find that a lot of the time these solutions are rooted in a desire to either shift one's own uncomfortableness or to preemptively secure one's own personal environment against social risk. A strong constitution requires the ability to remain stoic through periods of uncomfortableness and risk. 

Not to mention the fact that if a weak constitution is an uncontrolled property, it seems to follow that a strong constitution would also be so. 

Edit: Also, not to imply that everybody is sociopathic, but it's likely the case that physically disabled people receive higher levels of kindness from strangers because those people want to be *seen* as kind. It's also possible that they are simply not observant enough to notice a trait that is as ephemeral as insecurity.",2015-09-09 05:30:40+00:00,cuvbisv,4,t1_cuvba33,652,AskReddit
