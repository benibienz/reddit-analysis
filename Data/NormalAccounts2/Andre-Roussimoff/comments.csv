47,"one of his latest promo : 

Lethal : ""Now I got something to say and it's simply what I've been saying from day one. I'm the greatest wrestler in the world. Hey, hey Lio Rush. You know what, you're good man. You're really good . And someday you may be even better than me because that's always what happens in life. Somebody always is there to take your place, but right now I ain't letting go of that place, because I'm the greatest wrestler in the world and I've proved it! 

I proved it because I have beaten— I have beaten every man in that locker room. There are no challengers left here. I beat everyone, from the top to the bottom. I just wrestled Lio Rush, the winner of the Top Prospect Tournament. That proves Ring Of Honor ran out of ideas because there's no one left for me. I'm the greatest wrestler in the locker room, of the world, 'cause I'm the greatest. Someone go Nigel McGuinness— Kevin Kelly, tell Nigel McGuinness that there is nobody left. There is nobody—"" 

Surprise apparition of Colt Cabana 

Cabana : ""You're saying that there's nobody left, Jay Lethal. You're saying that there's nobody left. See, I've been here since 2002, friend. I've seen 'em all, Jay Lethal, hold exactly what you're holding. You name 'em, I've seen 'em from Aries to Nigel to Punk to Dragon to Tyler to Joe, I've watched 'em all, Jay. I've watched 'em all go to the very top. I've seen them start at the bottom and I have seen them rise to the very top. I've always been ok with my place on the card, Jay. I've always understood that I make them laugh, dance a little bit, entertain them because I believed in an idea. I believed in a product, I believed in a Ring Of Honor, I believed in an underground movement, I believed in what Cary Silkin believed in, I believed in an alternative! And I still believe in an alternative today, and you say that there's nobody left Jay Lethal! You've said it now, you've said it on TV and it makes me think about myself, about my legacy, what I want to be remembered as. Sometimes you have to look yourself in the mirror and know exactly what you want to be. I don't— I DON'T want to be known as somebody's friend. I LOVE what I'm doing. I LOVE that I'm an independent wrestler. I LOVE that I'm DIY. Nobody owns me! Nobody tells me what to do, Jay Lethal. You say that there's nobody left, nobody to tell me what to do, nobody can fire me, and I know that you have been fired before Jay Lethal. 
I know your story and you better believe I've been fired before and I've been rejected before. You name it in wrestling: I've been fired and I've been rejected, I've been fired and I've been rejected. And you know what happens when you're fired and you're rejected in wrestling, Jay? You know what happens? You're kicked out of wrestling. They ostracize you! They tell you, that nobody wants you, nobody books you, you're fired and you're rejected— EXCEPT ... everybody still wants to see me, Jay. I'm still booked, I'm still doing what I do, and you know who can't fire and you know who can't reject me? THESE people! And I should have done it for a long time, Jay. I should have done it for a long time. I should have been kicked out and I should have been gone, but the reality is I'm not 'cause they're still chanting my name. "" 

Lethal: ""Whoa, let me stop you right there because the fact of the matter is these people here can't make you the greatest wrestler in the world. THIS does . This does, Colt, and I have it. In fact, you haven't been here in FIVE years. For FIVE years, you've been avoiding this place because you know that I am the greatest. For five years, you've traveled the world on small local indie shows in India, in Germany, all over the world, but you avoided this place for five years, you know why? Because I'm the greatest and ALSO there's another reason! There's another reason you haven't been here in five years and it's 'cause me and that entire locker room, and whether they believe it or not, they don't want you here and neither do I."" 

Cabana: ""You don't think they want me here, Jay? You don't think corporate american wrestling doesn't want me here? You don't think that I was getting phone calls after phone calls the day after they fired the guy with the racket? The guy that owns this place was calling me and you know what I said, Jay? I got a call from here begging me to come back and I said ""No"". I said I'm not interested. I had a chip on my shoulder. I said no, no thank you. I like what I'm doing. I like going to India. I like going to Japan. I like going to Germany. I've traveled all over— these people are from all around the world and I don't make them come to me. I have literally been to every single place where every single person has been so I could wrestle as an independent wrestler, Jay, but I got a phone call, and this time ... maybe I said something different. You're saying there's nobody left, Jay Lethal. Maybe I said something different and it's not 'cause of the money and it's not 'cause of TV, Jay, because when I look back at my career I have been doing this a long, long, long, long, long time and I won't be able to live with myself unless I am able to wear that around my waist ."" 

Jay slap Cabana 

Cabana: ""Do it again. Do it again. Hit me again. Slap me again. Do it again. Slap me. You say that there's nobody left, Jay, but now there is  . ""

55,"Clay debuted as Del Rio's new bodyguard . After a three-month absence due to the filming of No One Lives, Clay reappeared on the August 4, 2011 episode of Superstars. Over the next few weeks, Clay continued to squash various jobbers on Superstars. WWE ran vignettes promoting his return to television on the November 7, 2011 episode of Raw.However, Clay's television return was continuously delayed by authority figure John Laurinaitis to be ""next week""with this trend continuing all the way into January 2012.Clay made his television return on the January 9, 2012 episode of Raw as a face (heroic character) with a fun-loving, funk dancing gimmick, with the nickname ""The Funkasaurus"". Now accompanied by The Funkadactyls (Naomi and Cameron) and announced as hailing from ""Planet Funk"", Clay incorporated gyrations and dance moves into his various squash wins on both Raw and SmackDown. At the Royal Rumble event, Clay squashed Drew McIntyre. Clay then was absent from WWE programming for nearly two months before his reappearance on the March 12 episode of Raw.At WrestleMania XXVIII, Clay made an on-stage appearance, calling and dancing with Momma Clay. Clay was on a 21-match winning streak since adopting the Funkasaurus gimmick .On the May 28 episode of Raw, Big Show justified his recent villainous turn by blaming Clay for dancing in the ring instead of sympathizing with Show shortly after Show was forced to beg for his job and was yet fired; hearing this, Clay then challenged Show to a match that night. Before the match could start, Show attacked Clay at ringside and brutally assaulted him. On the June 8 episode of SmackDown, Clay was banned by General Manager John Laurinaitis from appearing on Raw ""to protect him from Big Show"" so he was transferred to SmackDown. Big Show's attack also led Clay to vow to be more aggressive in the ring.
 Clay was allowed to return to Raw from June 25, where he faced Big Show; Show defeated Clay to end Clay's 24-match winning streak.
On the January 28 episode of Raw in Las Vegas, Clay was to face Tensai in a lingerie pillow fight (determined via the RAW Roulette wheel) but this was changed instead to a dance off. Tensai however still showed up in lingerie because (kayfabe) Clay forgot to inform him of the change. Tensai was embarrassed, But Clay encouraged him to dance and have fun because ""what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"". Tensai with Clay encouragement began using several ""silly dance moves"". Two days later on WWE Main Event, Clay came out to support Tensai during his match with Titus O'Neil and Tensai danced with Clay after the match. Following this, Clay and Tensai formed a tag team and they went on to defeat established teams such as Primo and Epico, Heath Slater and Jinder Mahal of 3MB and Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow), with the latter match taking place during the pre-show of Elimination Chamber on February 17.

Heyman: “Well, yes and I’d be very excited to see a Lucha style that can thrive in WWE and perhaps this upcoming Cruiserweight series is a place for that to thrive. WWE has a short history of taking great Luchadores and having them acclimate and assimilate to the WWE style. I’m wondering if in the future the ingredients to the soup include letting the Luchadores do the Lucha style and bringing that style forward to expand WWE’s audience instead of luring the audience in to see these great Luchadores wrestle on WWE’s platform.”",2016-04-02 20:39:09+00:00,d1nc8nm,1.0,t3_4d2z60,3355.0,SquaredCircle

“There’s some guys who used to wrestle for the other company in the US that are not working there any more… Bobby Roode and Eric Young,” AJ said, “I would want to see those guys make their way on over.”

The former TNA World Champion was also asked about Chris Jericho kicking out of The Styles Clash, which has seldomly been seen executed on WWE TV since Styles’ WWE debut.

“It is what it is. I’ve had people kick out of the Styles Clash before – it’s not something that hasn’t happened before,” AJ answered. “It’s just one of those things. It was part of the match and it was a very good one! The finish came shortly after that with the Calf Crusher. It was still a great match.

“I hope to have more than one main weapon. I have the Phenomenal Forearm as we’re calling it now, the Calf Crusher – the Styles Clash is still available. I like to have a lot of alternative moves to hit people with and whatever seems to work is what I’ll go with",2016-03-29 12:04:13+00:00,d1hjzoj,1.0,t3_4cf4an,42.0,SquaredCircle
