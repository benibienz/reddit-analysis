(Kudos to r/MrSuperBacon ,   Link here : https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/4dudg2/global_force_wrestling_is_now_trying_to_scam_you/d1uocxc ) .

It was about WRP , and I didn't know what was that so I dig a little . Here we go :

Wrestling Retribution Project was a professional wrestling television program developed by Jeff Katz. Founded in 2011, the promotion was based on a 13 week serial schedule. Upon completion of production, the program was to be distributed by Image Entertainment, and available via streaming media and DVD. In early 2011, Former VP of Production at 20th Century Fox and New Line Cinema, Jeff Katz, began venting frustrations via his Twitter page with the current wrestling product broadcast worldwide by companies such as WWE and TNA. In May 2011, he began a fundraising drive via the crowdfunding website Kickstarter with a goal to raise $100,000 for an alternative wrestling venture. By June 21, 2011, the goal was achieved through 187 pledges. Shortly thereafter, casting and pre-production of the series began. A thirteen-week first season was taped from October 10 to 12, 2011, at the Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Fergal Devitt and Shawn Spears, who were both announced for the tapings, could not make it due to visa issues.

The project name was changed from ""Wrestling Revolution Project"" to ""Wrestling Retribution Project"" on November 21, 2011.

The project has faced numerous criticisms from donors, frustrated by the lack of information about whether the project is still forthcoming and what their money was spent on.

In June 2013 an update was posted to the Kickstarter page, with a link to the video of their Champion's Grail battle royal.

The casting contains : Timothy Thatcher , The Young Bucks , Joey Ryan , Chris Hero , Chris Masters , Emil Sitoci , Amazing Red , Shawn Daivari , Brian Cage , Luke Gallows , ""Machine Gun"" Karl Anderson , MVP , Colt Cabana , Sami Callihan , Kenny Omega and others ...

in 2013 , Katz also announced that anyone who supported the project via Kickstarter will get their money back, and below is the official statement (http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/274413-jeff-katz-issues-statement-on-the-status-of-wrestling-revolution-project-kickstarter-money-to-be-returned ) Is that true ?

One of the most talked about storylines on it was going to feature Joey Ryan as a closeted homosexual wrestler, Chase Walker, who was going to be found out by his rivals, eventually own up to who he really was and continue to fight the good fight. All without succumbing to the usual stereotypes of a homosexual wrestler being presented as weird or bizarre.

""This function of grandiloquence is indeed the same as that of the ancient theatre, whose principle, language
and props (masks and buskins) concurred in the exaggeratedly visible explanation of a Necessity. The
gesture of the vanquished wrestler signifying to the world a defeat which, far from disgusting, he
emphasizes and holds like a pause in music, corresponds to the mask of antiquity meant to signify the tragic
mode of the spectacle. In wrestling, as on the stage in antiquity, one is not ashamed of one's suffering, one
knows how to cry, one has a liking for tears.
Each sign in wrestling is therefore endowed with an absolute clarity, since one must always understand
everything on the spot. As soon as the adversaries are in the ring, the public is overwhelmed with the
obviousness of the roles. As in the theatre, each physical type expresses to excess the part which has been
assigned to the contestant. Thauvin, a fifty-year-old with an obese and sagging body, whose type of asexual
hideousness always inspires feminine nicknames, displays in his flesh the characters of baseness, for his
part is to represent what, in the classical concept of the salaud, the 'bastard' (the key-concept of any
wrestling-match), appears as organically repugnant. The nausea voluntarily provoked by Thauvin shows
therefore a very extended use of signs: not only is ugliness used here in order to signify baseness, but in
addition ugliness is wholly gathered into a particularly repulsive quality of matter: the pallid collapse of
dead flesh (the public calls Thauvin la barbaque, 'stinking meat'), so that the passionate condemnation of
the crowd no longer stems from its judgment, but instead from the very depth of its humours. It will
thereafter let itself be frenetically embroiled in an idea of Thauvin which will conform entirely with this
physical origin: his actions will perfectly correspond to the essential viscosity of his personage.
It is therefore in the body of the wrestler that we find the first key to the contest. I know from the start that
all of Thauvin's actions, his treacheries, cruelties, and acts of cowardice, will not fail to measure up to the
first image of ignobility he gave me; I can trust him to carry out intelligently and to the last detail all the
gestures of a kind of amorphous baseness, and thus fill to the brim the image of the most repugnant bastard
there is: the bastard-octopus. [Barthes goes on to describe other 'character roles' in wrestling, comparing
them to stock characters in the Italian tradition of Commedia dell'Arte.] Wrestling is like a diacritic writing:
above the fundamental meaning of his body, the wrestling arranges comments which are episodic but
always opportune, and constantly help the reading of the fight by means of gestures, attitudes and mimicry
which make the intention utterly obvious. Sometimes the wrestler triumphs with a repulsive sneer while
kneeling on the good sportsman; sometimes he gives the crowd a conceited smile which forebodes an early
revenge; sometimes, pinned to the ground, he hits the floor ostentatiously to make evident to all the
intolerable nature of his situation [. . .] ""

Wrestling is not a sport, it is a spectacle, and it is no more ignoble to attend a wrestled performance of Suffering than a performance of the sorrows of  Andromache [ litterature 's character ] . Of course, there exists a false wrestling, in which the participants unnecessarily go to great lengths to make a show of a fair fight; this is of no interest. True wrestling, wrong called amateur wrestling, is performed in second-rate halls, where the public spontaneously attunes itself to the spectacular nature of the contest, like the audience at a suburban cinema. Then these same people wax indignant because wrestling is a stage-managed sport (which ought, by the way, to mitigate its ignominy). The public is completely uninterested in knowing whether the contest is rigged or not, and rightly so; it abandons itself to the primary virtue of the spectacle, which is to abolish all motives and all consequences: what matters is not what it thinks but what it sees.

If it weren't a subjective matter, I'd say it's a fact. I'm not talking about the best in-ring performer or the biggest draw or whatever denomination you want to break a wrestler down to. He is the best asset in the WWE in the company. He has been for years now.

And the scary thing is that WWE has known this for quite some time.

This isn't one of those ""how Sasha Banks became The Boss"" or ""Seth Rollins was always the right choice"" posts to fit the narrative of them winning the title and make a total fairy tale out of their rise to the top. Dean hasn't reached that plateau and who knows if he ever will. But after watching the Royal Rumble and Dean's confrontation with Brock, it finally dawned on me: Dean Ambrose has been their go-to guy for years.

Think about it. While the Shield initially was supposed to be CM Punk's faction, the guy who always stood out at first and was the featured mouthpiece was Dean Ambrose. It was always assumed that if there was a leader, it was Dean. Sure, WWE flipped it around to say Seth was ""The Architect"", but no one ever thought for a moment it was him in their time together. Dean Ambrose was the guy they chose to stand alone as the singles' champion (say what you will about the reign itself) while Seth and Roman complimented each other where needed. When things went south or awry with the Shield, Dean Ambrose was always the fall guy.

He'd take the constant losses to CM Punk, he'd take the bump for old legends like Dusty Rhodes or Jake the Snake (allowing him to put Damien on him), and he'd eat the spear to ""make Roman look strong"" and take the pin for the team. Even when Roman and Bray were supposed to be the leaders going into the Shield/Wyatt feud, it was Ambrose who ignited the fight and actually got in Bray's face. He brawled far more with Bray during the match, even fighting into the crowd with him.

And when the Shield finally broke up, Dean Ambrose seemed like he faded into the background as Roman Reigns was getting push as the next top face and Seth Rollins the next top heel. Seth was getting hot, Roman was going undefeated and getting wins over major players like Randy Orton, and Dean was just kinda' there, slowly sinking into the midcard.

At least, that's what it seemed like. In reality, Dean was actually the hottest out of the three of them coming out the break up and they used what fire he had to get others over. Outside of perhaps Daniel Bryan and the Authority, Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins was the best rivalry of the year. Dean Ambrose not only put over Seth Rollins huge as a heel during the entire feud, he constantly was the best part of it. His relentless pursuit of Seth, the constant popping up out of nowhere, even the wacky scripted stuff he turned into gold (except the segment Mick Foley had to save). Even the matches were excellent with Ambrose taking so much abuse and toll on his body (powerbombs onto stacks of chairs, the cinder block spot, HIAC, etc).

He was absolutely white hot and the crowd was fully behind him. That's not just saying ""he's over because the crowd's loud for him"", it can be backed up by the fact that after the Black Friday sale his merch was the top selling item in the biggest online sales day ever for the company. Cyber Monday was only the 2nd biggest ever. I've heard no such follow up numbers for 2015's sale. It seemed as if he were en route to beat Seth Rollins and finally exact revenge on Seth Rollins.

And then, a returning Bray Wyatt happened. He interfered, Seth went over again to keep his momentum, and Dean was left to get over a rehabbing Bray Wyatt. Dean's momentum began to wane, Bray kept going over to build himself up for Taker, and the whole feud blew up right in Dean's face. Around this time, even I started losing some faith that my favorite guy, one of the guys that made me start watching wrestling again, was never going to be anything more than a mid-card transition guy.

After the infamous 2015 Royal Rumble, Dean Ambrose started going after the Intercontinental Championship claiming that he wanted to have his face on the wall at headquarters... whatever. That isn't what made a then garbage title with a poorly booked champion hot. What did was what Dean Ambrose did with it. He wasn't sitting back or just waiting for a challenge, he actively went after Barrett and forced him into a title match. For once, someone was proactively wanting to take ownership of this belt and be proud of it. I believed in everything he did.

Match at Fast Lane happens and, again, Dean Ambrose loses. This time via DQ because he ""wrestled too much"" as Barrett tried to cower away. Dean still hasn't won a PPV match since the start of his singles' run. But after the match, he just took the title. He dared Barrett to take it from him as he stood in his face. Barrett did nothing and Ambrose walked off claiming to be the champion.

All the sudden the Intercontinental title started picking up steam and got hot with Dean Ambrose, the guy who wasn't even champion, claiming that he would defend it with his life. And it was all Dean's gimmick... until two weeks later when it transitioned and became everyone's gimmick. Dolph Ziggler, Daniel Bryan, R-Truth, Stardust, and Luke Harper all joined in and started stealing the title as well. They would go into 'Mania, Dean would take a near death plunge through a ladder, and all the momentum transferred to Daniel Bryan. Dean just kinda' moved on and forgot the Intercontinental Title was even a thing. This may have been the only time during Daniel Bryan's career I was furious with him winning something. The crazier thing is that after Ambrose went through that ladder and got staples in his head, the very next night he was wrestling John Cena as the first open challenger. Bizarre.

Finally, after the Shield broke up, Dean Ambrose won his first PPV match against Luke Harper at Extreme Rules. Finally. And then, somehow, the next PPV he was in a Fatal-Four Way title match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. I couldn't make heads or tails of it either. Randy Orton (beat Rollins at Mania and got cheated at ER) and Reigns (got cashed in on) made sense, but Ambrose? I thought for sure he was just there to eat the pin and I'm pretty sure most thought that as well (or Orton).

Orton ended up eating the pin. But there was something notable to take away from that match. After Randy and Seth got powerbombed through tables, Dean and Roman got in the ring together. This was not too long ago from Roman Reigns being booed out the building at the Rumble and being received negatively at 'Mania. As Ambrose and Roman fought one-on-one, the crowd was firmly in support of Ambrose and booing Reigns.

I only bring this up because after this match was over, they went to Ambrose vs. Rollins for the next PPV and not Roman. In fact, Roman took a total backseat in storyline as Dean came up to Seth asking for a title shot and then later threatening Seth's life for it. The twist that they put on the match was that if Roman interfered, Dean would lose the match. They teased dissension. We thought we knew what was coming: a heel turn from either guy.

Instead, Dean Ambrose won the match and beat Seth Rollins clean in the middle of the ring and the crowd rejoiced. I completely lost it and popped when it happened. Ambrose was striking hot again. I couldn't believe it. And I shouldn't have. Sure enough, they pulled the dusty finish on Ambrose and determined it a disqualification and Seth retained. Ambrose tried to keep the title but got jumped by Kane and J&amp;J until Roman Reigns arrived to save him.

Now, while I didn't think WWE knew how valuable Dean Ambrose was at the time, I did know what they were doing here. They certainly weren't turning Roman or Dean heel. They couldn't. Turning Ambrose would be stupid and they're actively trying to get Reigns over as a top face. They were using Dean to give the rub to Roman. Seth was beloved for what he did at 'Mania, so you needed to finally start to get some actual heat on the guy. Beating Orton wasn't going to cut it, so you have him escape and slither out of what shouldn't have been a victory against Dean Ambrose, who he betrayed. That's how you make Seth Rollins a hated man.

But that's only part of the equation. You could easily just plug in Roman at this point and have him beat Seth, but you need to make sure he's getting over with the crowd. Now that you've gotten the heat on Seth, you hit Roman's music. Have him come down and save Ambrose and look like a hero as they both walk off and celebrate. Best friend Roman Reigns and saved his little buddy and brother, Dean. And from there, you successfully start rubbing Dean's momentum off on Roman as Dean parades around with the title claiming that he beat Seth fair and square.

This put WWE in an interesting position: they needed Reigns to get over and Ambrose to stick with him. You can't put the title on Ambrose because that doesn't help what you're trying to accomplish with Reigns. But you also can't have Reigns carrying Money in the Bank with his buddy at his side because you'll start splitting reactions again. So, you have them both lose.

Reigns doesn't win Money in the Bank after getting stopped by Bray Wyatt. Ambrose loses his title rematch against Seth after getting demolished practically the entire match and is sent to the back of the line (despite a flash finish for the belt). This forced them to band together for a little while to fend off the Wyatts.And they kept them as tight as possible. And as this feud went on, you noticed Reigns coming into the forefront more and more and Dean slipping into the background. It got to a point where Reigns was actually taking on the entire Wyatt Family on his own and walking through them and Dean was just fiddling around with Orton or getting checked by Jericho, who just disappears shortly after.

And it was working. The rub finally paid off. Roman beats Bray at Hell in a Cell, Ambrose's tag match doesn't happen because Orton got injured. Roman then becomes number one contender the night after, massively cheered, and steps up to Seth Rollins. And Dean Ambrose? Cheering on Roman Reigns in the background. Seriously. He wasn't even placed in the eight for the number one contender's match because it was only for the winners at HIAC.

One misstep later, everything changed. Seth Rollins was out with his torn ACL and MCL and suddenly the big, bad villain for Roman to conquer was gone. Guess who magically came back?

I hate to admit it, but any comparison to Dean Ambrose being a cockroach may be accurate. You can't kill the guy and some way or another he's poking his head back out into the main picture. He went from not even being in the running for the #1 contender spot to beating a then monster Kevin Owens clean and facing Roman Reigns in the finals for the championship. Mind blowing.

Dean of course did the job and put Reigns over as champion and Sheamus cashed in on him after he refused to shake HHH's hand. All the sudden, Dean found himself in a feud with Kevin Owens for the Intercontinental Title... and he won three weeks later to become the new champion. He beat him TWICE. The next day, Vince McMahon returns and Roman wins the title back to a massive ovation. The two brothers stand together as the company's two champions and perhaps two of the strongest on the roster.

Fast forward to the Royal Rumble. Dean Ambrose goes through hell with Kevin Owens in a Last Man Standing match and stands tall again, looking great as Intercontinental Champion. We all knew he would have to be in the Royal Rumble later that night. One versus all (not really) for Roman Reigns as he starts at one. The crowd didn't receive him warmly, but it wasn't anything outrageous or worrying. It wasn't until a stupid booking decision that the thunderous boos came. Roman, HHH, Sheamus, and Dean Ambrose left. Right after Reigns dumped Sheamus over the top rope, something unexpected happened.

HHH eliminated Roman. Almost effortlessly. Just came up behind him, never saw it coming. The crowd erupted in cheers with Dean Ambrose and HHH as the finalists, firmly behind Ambrose. They went back and forth a bit until HHH eliminated Dean.

What was weird to me is that Dean was the last one in there with HHH. Why? There were rumors of an audible being called last minute because of the reaction and way Roman was received, but even then... why Dean? They had every reason to throw him out... after all, he just came out of a last man standing match. But no, he was the last one in there with HHH.

It didn't make sense until last week. They realize how valuable Dean is. He's not only got a connection with the crowd, but the guy has been put through all this hell for years and he's still standing. He's perhaps the only face that will never get booed on the roster right now that is capable of wrestling. He's the guy.

Seriously, look at the follow up after the Royal Rumble: Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns, and Brock Lesnar are named the contenders for the title. This story line has been so centered on Roman Reigns and HHH/McMahons. Yet, Roman almost feels as if he's not even there or that he even really cares about HHH. He's dish rag boring right now as Ambrose contending with Lesnar feels full of fire and lively.

And they're LETTING Ambrose do this and he's getting over, unlike their attempts with Reigns. Remember all the protection Reigns got with Lesnar and even now to an extent? They're not afraid to let Ambrose go out there and get in Brock's grill and seem ready for a fight. The crowd is so firmly invested in Brock and Ambrose, I can't see how they could possibly let Roman win this match. It would be absolutely deflating because he's just the guy in the background of all of this. It'd be so underwhelming.

So, I'm starting to wonder: what if Dean actually wins this match? I even starting to get myself to believe that Dean is actually going to win this match because they understand what they have in him. Let's be honest, I understand that the big idea is to have a coronation for Reigns at Mania, but does Roman honestly carry that much more star power than Dean Ambrose? If any at all?

And I think they're realizing that they're at the end of their rope with Reigns and Ambrose together. They keep pitting them together for the championship. At some point, someone's gotta' turn. You can't turn Dean heel and keep Roman face, that will absolutely backfire right now. Dean is the people's guy. Roman Reigns does the big charity stuff and Good Morning America spot and Hot 97, Dean is the guy who shows up on your local news station and tells stories of why you should show up to RAW. That's not imagery or romanticizing, that's for real. Roman doesn't go to local and do that. Dean Ambrose feels like one of us and that's a connection not many other have and he's believable.

They're finally moving Ambrose away from just being ""a lunatic"" to a guy who is persistent and will go through hell to succeed. He actually never gives up. It's absolute fire. It has wheels and gets over as a face. So, why not tell the natural story you have? Dean Ambrose has always been upfront and honest about all of this. He's said that if him and Roman were in the ring, he'd punch him. He'd fight him because it's about the championship. And whoever wins wins. With Roman, he's the Authority's guy. It's who they want. If he loses at Fast Lane, maybe the message the Authority has been trying to hammer in to him finally sets in and he starts to get jealous after getting their so many times, but not being able to retain. The Authority finally gets to Roman and they get their guy, slowly but surely. And after Wrestlemania, you create two stars and start to unravel a major feud with your biggest asset and face, Dean Ambrose, and your new top monster heel, Roman Reigns. Both in the roles they should be in right now.

And there's not a huge adjustment you need to make with Reigns. He can still be a bad guy heel and do charities and public appearances much like Steph does and say he does it per the Authority. And you can finally pay off the best asset in your company, the guy you've relied on for years, especially when things fell apart.

This was far and away the best opening Raw segment I can remember.

Brock Lesnar comes out with Paul Heyman and he stands around looking scary as hell because he's Brock Lesnar. Dude is a human version of a bear. We get exposition from Heyman and it was fine, considering he wasn't saying anything anyone else wouldn't be saying in the same position.

Gotta tell us the who, what, when, where, and why and all that.

Heyman makes sure to get a few shots in on Lesnar's upcoming opponents, though, including calling out Ambrose for being a nutjob. Then, Ambrose shows up.

The interaction between Dean and Brock is PERFECT.

Ambrose starts by making clear what we've been saying all along: He's not crazy. At this point he's a sympathetic babyface if only because people keep dismissing him as crazy when that's so clearly not the case. He walks right up to Brock and tells him he knows this was probably a bad idea but he isn't stupid and he's not scared.

Chuckling, Lesnar responds with ""is that right?""

Dean plays it straight: ""I came out here to tell you I want the title. I want it so bad, I'm going to fight my own brother for it, and I'm going to fight you for it. Take me to Suplex City, baby!""

""Oh, I will,"" Brock tells him smiling.

Ambrose went on to say, essentially, that he knows Brock is going to beat him almost to death but he's made of iron and he will never, ever stop coming forward. His dream is in sight, and he will go through hell to do it.

This was Ambrose, knowing he's fighting a fucking bear, climbing into the cage and sizing the bear up. At first I thought it was about finding out if he could do it but I think that initial response was misguided. I think there was more to it.

Lesnar, the big ol' bear, couldn't have shown him any less respect. A puny human had just walked into his cage. He sees no threat there. In his mind, he's already won, it's just a matter of getting to the match to get to the killing.

What makes this so interesting is everything we've talked about with the Ambrose character up to this point, and what I was referencing when I said there was more to this. Yes, it's entirely possible he will get mauled and bruised and damn near destroyed. But there is nothing Lesnar can possibly do to him that his life hasn't already done. He's been fighting battles like this from day one. He was born into the struggle, molded by the sacrifices it's taken to get him to this very point.

Lesnar, as the bear in the cage, can't know this. If there is a single thought in his head, there is a 0-percent chance that thought has anything to do with doubting his own ability to easily dispose of this man.

As Dean has already indicated, that's where he can win. That's the weakness he has to exploit. Lesnar is a big, muscular beast, strong and ferocious but what happens when that kill doesn't come as quick and easy as he anticipates? What happens when those big strong muscles get tired?

It's almost a shame there's a wildcard involved here.

There is a wildcard involved here, however, and that's Roman Reigns. He first came into the picture in a backstage meeting, alongside Ambrose, with Stephanie McMahon. This was also great because it gave Stephanie the chance to be deliciously evil self, attempting to play the two against each other.

""Absolute power corrupts absolutely.""

Reigns and Ambrose played this off well but there are still two weeks for The Authority to continue poisoning the well. She put the two in a tag team match in the main event to provide even more opportunity for distrust and deception.

When the main event came around, they just worked a regular match and the two went over on New Day clean. After, Lesnar came out and took advantage of New Day coming up from behind to attack a waiting Ambrose and Reigns, hitting Dean with an F-5 and leaving while Roman was taken to the outside, spared of any interaction.

This was bizarre for a number of reasons. For starters, why not at least tease the possibility of disfunction in the tag match, if only to add some intrigue? What's more, why keep Lesnar and Reigns so far apart? If I didn't know better, I would think they were setting up to establish the Lesnar-Ambrose side of the triple threat to be the featured side, but it's far more likely they're attempting to build to a some sort of epic confrontation between Brock and Roman.

If so, that's incredibly poor planning. That opening segment absolutely showed the far more interesting story here is with Ambrose and Lesnar. Reigns can add to the story but at this moment, I'm not seeing how if they aren't going to tease some dissension between the two.

Even so, they completely turned this around with one episode of television. How they got here is still incredibly stupid but what they did in the first week leading to the match at Fastlane was perfect.

Some just don't like it and I can understand that . Many just don't understand . When you are watching Japanese wrestling for the first time , it could be a hard experience so I want to share that text , wrote by Chris Charlton in his book : Lion's Pride ( the turbulent history of new japan pro wrestling ) . Here we go :
On the Philosophy and Psychology of Japanese Wrestling :

Japan was not at the “ground floor” of the pro wrestling business, wrestling becoming a phenomenon in the country after its rise in Europe and the Americas. After cards for decades were built around the concept of Japan versus the World, the psychology of a Japanese wrestling match became a strange hybrid of foreign and domestic philosophies, creating a unique viewing experience. A challenge new fans may have in watching Japanese wrestling is the difference in psychology, making a Japanese promotion less accessible than the easily grasped product of WWE for example, with its simple three act morality plays.

Take, for one issue, the babyface/Heel dynamic that is the basis for every western wrestling match. The evil heel's job is to cheat or otherwise be despicable in order to earn “heat” and move the crowd to the babyface's corner.On the face of it, modern NJPW is drastically short on heels. Kazuchika Okada has youthful arrogance as part of his character, yet as crowds mimicking his trademark Rainmaker pose, and buying into manager Gedo's promos, with his energetic delivery and rolled “r”s making him sound like a thug from a yakuza movie. Minoru Suzuki kicks the Young Lions that work as roadies , holding ropes open and cleaning the ring, as he makes his entrance, yet as he does so, the entire audience belts out the chorus to his entrance music, a triumphant “ Kaze ni nare” ( “become the wind”!) in a hair rock ballad.

Without a set and clearly defined babyface and heel, goes western logic, without explicit instruction to the audience as to whom to cheer or boo,, why , nobody would bother reacting to anyone ! A Taka Michonoku, or Taichi are traditional heels that garner “ the love to hate” reaction western fans expect, but they're undercard acts. The Bullet club are main event stars that consistently behave as heels, their nature as foreigners and outsiders making them easier to despise ( while still being popular at the merchandise table). In 2015, Tetsuya Naito would play a rare top tier Japanese heel, but only after aligning , himself with a foreign stable in CMLL's “ Los Ingobernables” .Why does everyone else in NJPW appear, at least up to a point, to be a babyface ? 

Perhaps it's in large part due to the nationalistic origins of wrestling in the country. Decades of main events saw Japanes babyfaces and foreign heels, and the huge match-ups between top Japanese stars played like “ what if” scenarios that didn't require the added set dressing of a devious opponent. The roots of the medium in Japan lead most domestic promotions to be babyfaces territories so to speak , companies built around an “Ace” that was established through months and years of consistent victories. In the nationalistic era of pro wrestling they were all conquering Japanese athletes , and when all Japanese main events became more common , it was less a matter of the crowd having no horse in the race, but rather being invested in their favourites regardless of out of the ring conduct.
Kazuchika Okada is a weallthy , conceited and cocky character in interviews, but has rarely been perceived by the audience as an outright heel in his matches with Hiroshi Tanahashi over the last three years. In fact, Tanahashi has often had a heelish approach in wrestling Okada , but there's a genuine interest in which star is superior overriding the “black and white hats” supposedly being worn. 

Whether a wrestler catches on with audience, then , is less about being all smiles and baby kissing , but more in showing “ fighting spirit” , and toughness and expertise under pressure. Unlike in the west, Japan has never fully let go of the concept of “kayfabe” ; while in WWE frequently breaks, and redefines the four walls 
of fiction by having babyface superstars declare their goals of entertaining rather than victory, Japanese cards for the most part are presented and sold as legitimate
sporting event , even if the audience is at least vaguely wise to the way things work. To whit, victories and losses carry a heavy significance , and in-ring , a star taking punishment and fighting back is deeply appreciated.

A six month angle ran in the summer of 2014 that centered on a long losing streak for Tomoaki Honma . Yet, in showing fire and in coming so close to victory in strong performances with the likes of Tomohiro Ishii or Katsuyori Shibata, Honma emerged as a solid fan favourite , whereas losing streak angles in the US are rarely successful . A similar level of respect is shown to Ishii, despite his gruff, plain interviews. A mixture of convincing selling and repeatedly interrupted legitimate injuries has cemented him in the upper echelon of talent in fan's eyes.

What of the match structure itself in Japan ? Fundamentally things are similar, although with few angles and talking segments in Japanese wrestling, and NJPW in particular , more emphasis is placed on a match to tell a story, and distinctions in character are more subtle . The US philosophy of “cheating for heat” is largely absent, but transitions in pacing where mat wresting is suddenly interrupted by a strike or dive let fan know how to react. Crowds have favourites, but will often side with an underdog , even if it means changing allegiance . The best play up to this philosophy. Tanahashi is NJPW's “Ace” , and top babyface in a babyface territory, but often works in a helis manner to get fans behind the idea of an upset loss.

The underdog's fighting spirit , the idea of a wrestler standing up to heavy damage, often seemingly receiving a shot of adrenaline to withstand a powerful move  
only to pop up and go on offense, are cornerstones of “strong style”. NJPW coined the term close to the company's inception. Inoki , along with Kotetsu Yamamoto , have since been identified as its pionneers, as they trained talent in New Japan's dojo. It's often reductively explained as a hard hitting style, where strikes in particular are laid in far more forcefully than in western matches, where grueling travel schedules preclude potentially injurious wrestling styles.

Strong style is really a marketting term that codifies the hybrid style emergent in Japan in the '70s and persists in main events today. Inoki himself was strongly influenced by Karl Gotch, Rikidozan, and Bill Robinson, and most NJPW stars have spent time in Europe and the Americas as part of their journey to the main roster. Strong style marries the showmanship of American wrestling with the grappling of European Catch, and it's the best of all worlds approach that makes Japanese wrestling so compelling.

Strong style has its tropes though, and isn't safe from criticism. Short cuts to showing fighting spirit often feel like phallus waving ; during All Japan's hottest period in the 1990s wrestlers like Mitsuharu Misawa, Toshiaki Kawada and Kenta Kobashi trading elbow shots in a long drawn out slugfest was commonplace , and garnered huge reactions. Used today, it can often get tired when the spot is repeated in a card. Some, too , are seemingly eager to prove themselves in a needlessly reckless fashion ; in today's age of awareness as to the dangers of concussions, Hiroki Goto or Tomohiro Ishhi unleashing skull to skull unprotected headbutts seems like an odd anachronism. 

Ther's concern too that the tough nature of the style forces a certain old fashioned mentality on wrestlers, pushing too hard inside the ring , and being uncaring of health outside of it. Recently there does seem to be more protection for talent in NJPW ; Kota Ibushi missed three months of action in 2014 after a concussion , when he may have rushed back otherwise. Still , this has come at the expense of well being and lives ; Misawa's death in the ring at NOAH event in 2009 could well have been averted had he not wrestled in such a physical manner , especially when in ill health and injured. 

All Japn star Nobukazu Hirai was assaulted by stablemates backstage after a match in 2011 as punishment for a poor performance ; he suffered a stroke in a match shortly after and went into coma. While freak accidents happen everywhere in wrestling, in-ring deaths ( such as the death of Masakazu Fukuda after an errant elbow drop by Katsuyori Shibata in 2000 ) seem less rare in Japan than elsehere , and there is an argument for greater care to be granted to talent in and out of the ring.

Tanahashi is at the forefront of a new philosophy in Japan, and as an ambassador for the medium at large in the country has spoken publicly about having a more moderate philosophy, a happy medium between the all out showmanship of WWE and the “ kibishi” ( strict/harsh ) older Strong Style. NJPW have even explored different philosophies on wrestling's direction in the ring. Matches with Tanahashi against hard hittingveteran Minoru Suzuki ans Strong Style devotee Shibata have seen real disagreements on where wrestling should be headed play out in frontr of the audience's eyes. The Japanese style is in the process of evolving once more, and hopefully in a way that retain its uniqueness while looking after his practioners.

Some just don't like it and I can understand that . Many just don't understand . When you are watching Japanese wrestling for the first time , it could be a hard experience so I want to share that text , wrote by Chris Charlton in his book : Lion's Pride ( the turbulent history of new japan pro wrestling ) . Here we go :

On the Philosophy and Psychology of Japanese Wrestling :

Japan was not at the “ground floor” of the pro wrestling business, wrestling becoming a phenomenon in the country after its rise in Europe and the Americas. After cards for decades were built around the concept of Japan versus the World, the psychology of a Japanese wrestling match became a strange hybrid of foreign and domestic philosophies, creating a unique viewing experience. A challenge new fans may have in watching Japanese wrestling is the difference in psychology, making a Japanese promotion less accessible than the easily grasped product of WWE for example, with its simple three act morality plays.

Take, for one issue, the babyface/Heel dynamic that is the basis for every western wrestling match. The evil heel's job is to cheat or otherwise be despicable in order to earn “heat” and move the crowd to the babyface's corner.On the face of it, modern NJPW is drastically short on heels. Kazuchika Okada has youthful arrogance as part of his character, yet as crowds mimicking his trademark Rainmaker pose, and buying into manager Gedo's promos, with his energetic delivery and rolled “r”s making him sound like a thug from a yakuza movie. Minoru Suzuki kicks the Young Lions that work as roadies , holding ropes open and cleaning the ring, as he makes his entrance, yet as he does so, the entire audience belts out the chorus to his entrance music, a triumphant “ Kaze ni nare” ( “become the wind”!) in a hair rock ballad.

Without a set and clearly defined babyface and heel, goes western logic, without explicit instruction to the audience as to whom to cheer or boo,, why , nobody would bother reacting to anyone ! A Taka Michonoku, or Taichi are traditional heels that garner “ the love to hate” reaction western fans expect, but they're undercard acts. The Bullet club are main event stars that consistently behave as heels, their nature as foreigners and outsiders making them easier to despise ( while still being popular at the merchandise table). In 2015, Tetsuya Naito would play a rare top tier Japanese heel, but only after aligning , himself with a foreign stable in CMLL's “ Los Ingobernables” .Why does everyone else in NJPW appear, at least up to a point, to be a babyface ? 

Perhaps it's in large part due to the nationalistic origins of wrestling in the country. Decades of main events saw Japanes babyfaces and foreign heels, and the huge match-ups between top Japanese stars played like “ what if” scenarios that didn't require the added set dressing of a devious opponent. The roots of the medium in Japan lead most domestic promotions to be babyfaces territories so to speak , companies built around an “Ace” that was established through months and years of consistent victories. In the nationalistic era of pro wrestling they were all conquering Japanese athletes , and when all Japanese main events became more common , it was less a matter of the crowd having no horse in the race, but rather being invested in their favourites regardless of out of the ring conduct.
Kazuchika Okada is a weallthy , conceited and cocky character in interviews, but has rarely been perceived by the audience as an outright heel in his matches with Hiroshi Tanahashi over the last three years. In fact, Tanahashi has often had a heelish approach in wrestling Okada , but there's a genuine interest in which star is superior overriding the “black and white hats” supposedly being worn. 

Whether a wrestler catches on with audience, then , is less about being all smiles and baby kissing , but more in showing “ fighting spirit” , and toughness and expertise under pressure. Unlike in the west, Japan has never fully let go of the concept of “kayfabe” ; while in WWE frequently breaks, and redefines the four walls 
of fiction by having babyface superstars declare their goals of entertaining rather than victory, Japanese cards for the most part are presented and sold as legitimate
sporting event , even if the audience is at least vaguely wise to the way things work. To whit, victories and losses carry a heavy significance , and in-ring , a star taking punishment and fighting back is deeply appreciated.

A six month angle ran in the summer of 2014 that centered on a long losing streak for Tomoaki Honma . Yet, in showing fire and in coming so close to victory in strong performances with the likes of Tomohiro Ishii or Katsuyori Shibata, Honma emerged as a solid fan favourite , whereas losing streak angles in the US are rarely successful . A similar level of respect is shown to Ishii, despite his gruff, plain interviews. A mixture of convincing selling and repeatedly interrupted legitimate injuries has cemented him in the upper echelon of talent in fan's eyes.

What of the match structure itself in Japan ? Fundamentally things are similar, although with few angles and talking segments in Japanese wrestling, and NJPW in particular , more emphasis is placed on a match to tell a story, and distinctions in character are more subtle . The US philosophy of “cheating for heat” is largely absent, but transitions in pacing where mat wresting is suddenly interrupted by a strike or dive let fan know how to react. Crowds have favourites, but will often side with an underdog , even if it means changing allegiance . The best play up to this philosophy. Tanahashi is NJPW's “Ace” , and top babyface in a babyface territory, but often works in a helis manner to get fans behind the idea of an upset loss.

The underdog's fighting spirit , the idea of a wrestler standing up to heavy damage, often seemingly receiving a shot of adrenaline to withstand a powerful move  
only to pop up and go on offense, are cornerstones of “strong style”. NJPW coined the term close to the company's inception.

Right now , I am reading "" Walking a Golden Mile "" , a book written by William Regal . For those who have scheduled to read that book , this could be a spoiler. Or call it a preview . 

In that book , William Regal tell us about wrestling is fake , I quote : "" So I will start by telling you this -yes , a professional wrestling  match is ""fixed"". But it is not fake. It's fixed because the participants know what the outcome of the match is going to be when they start. It is not fake because the action you see is genuine- it really does hurt. We are skilful but we are not magicians. No matter what you do, when a man weighing 300 pounds lands on you from a great height, it is going to hurt. People say we know how to fall , meaning we can fall in a controlled way. Yes we can- but in a wrestling match, with so many things going on at the same time and so many switches of momentum , too many things are outside your control. You can't help but fall in an uncontrolled way . That's why there will be so many injuries discussed in this book.""

1) Strong Style - Stiffer than WWE and I like it that way 
2 ) Young Lions - Even if I can like NXT , I prefer the way NJPW slowly build their newest talents. They all start with all black attire , they can choose their owns attires when they became more than a young lion . Opening matches quite all the time , mixing them with experienced wrestlers . Going to CMLL , NOAH or even ROH now to complete theirs in-ring abilities and grown a persona.
3) Long Term Storytelling - Something WWE doesn't knows ...
4) Tournaments - They actually mean something 
5) Multi Tag Matchs Everywhere - One wrestler almost always takes a spotlight in that kind of matches
6) Gaijins - Non-japanese wrestlers brings what needed in the company , unlike strangers in WWE ( with exceptions )
7) Veterans - Wrestlers continues to wrestle even if they are old , returning to young lions what others have done for them . A guy like Fujiwara still have good looking offenses ...
8 ) 1 Year Contrats for all the wrestlers - old style , finishing in January each year . Even if that allows WWE to take guys like Nakamura this year . The company is more important than the roster ...
9 ) Crowds - Yes , crowds . They are quiet until something special is happening , not cheering for cheering or trying to steal the show

The Leader , as you know , is Tetsuya Naito . I love the way he turn heel past year , using his experience in CMLL to come back with a new attitude , keeping his music while changing how he came to the ring . Naito unsuccessfully challenged 2015 G1 Climax winner Hiroshi Tanahashi for his IWGP Heavyweight Championship contract. During the match, the returning Takaaki Watanabe was revealed as Naito's new partner.A new persona for him too , EVIL , King of Darkness. His new finisher is a classic STO, his new entrance is very cool too. The third man of that stable is the masked BUSHI , a japanese heel luchadore using Mist and Low Blows  and a beautifull Leaping Codebreaker as a Finisher.

in the ring and that's what I prefer ...

Mascara Dorada (loaning in NJPW for 2O15 ) , 
Volador Jr (NWA World Historic Welterweight Champion et CMLL World Trios Champion) , 
Mistico II (CMLL World Trios Champion) , 
Atlantis (Mexican Light Heavyweight Champion) , 
Ultimo Guerrero (NWA World Historic Middleweight Champion) , 
Barbaro Cavernario (Mexican National Welterweight Champion) , 
Dragon Lee (CMLL World Lightweight Champion) ,

Guerrero Maya Jr , 
Fuego , 
Stuka Jr , 
Titan ,
Hechichero , 
Virus , 
The Panther , 
Bobby Z , 
Okumura , 

6 for their first time in Fantastica Mania : Dragon Lee, Guerrero Maya Jr, Hechichero, The Panther, Virus and Bobby Z



Some surprises to me , because La Sombra will not be here and neither Rush , Mascara Dorada or Marco Corleone ( Los Ingobernables Crew ) , I feel sad for Tetsuya Naito ...
About La Sombra , he loses his mask last September and will be substitute by EVIL ( Remenber Watanabe in ROH ? ) in the World Tag League this year . Also , He's will not be in CMLL in December ... If only it could be because he's going in NXT ...


My favorite to take place in NJPW in 2016 is Barbario Cavernario so far , What's yours ? ",SquaredCircle,About Fantastica Mania This Year ...,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/3t5q2i/about_fantastica_mania_this_year/

&gt; CATCH - VEN. 18 SEPT / 21H
RING OF HONOR
Le show de catch qui explose tout aux US débarque enfin en France : les Briscoe Brothers, le Bullet Club, Jay Lethal, ACH, Moose et toutes les nouvelles superstars sont désormais sur L’Équipe 21. Ring of Honor, pour les aficionados du catch, c’est juste ce qui ce fait de mieux.

I am glad , ROH will be on french TV ( and on a free channel ! ) .
Debut on September, 18 . No details on the deal yet , but I hope it's a long run . my only doubt , on September 18 there will be also the first match of France in Rugby World Cup and that's a big deal here so the ratings could be awfull ... Let's see , beacause this channel ( l'équipe21 ) makes poors ratings anyway ...  
And for me , that's amazing because AB1 is not free in France so I could not see the WWE on my TV unless I pay for it . I am also glad this little channel , extension of the french newspaper , have choose ROH and not TNA ! This new program replaces "" Fight Quest "" and will be on air every Friday at 9 p.m they said ...

Look at 7.45  and tell what do you think , please.

He call it : Feast Your Eyes (Backbreaker rack dropped into a knee lift)

Beside , he is one of the new guy I can mark for in ROH . Size , Athleticism , Power . Charisma ? and he will have to improve his mic skill ( he's working with Truth Martini for the moment , this should help him )
