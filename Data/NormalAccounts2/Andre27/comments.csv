I mean id be fine with decks that have 6/10 or like 8/10 of some theme if there was variation and you could sub out those 6 or 8 and so on for other cards of that tribe/theme and then maybe also sub out other cards of the deck if needed. But thats not the case because the other cards dont really make a viable themed deck. 
Id love it when you see a murloc deck, or dragon deck or beast deck or anything really that you wouldnt immediatly know what cards of that tribe/theme they will be running and what they wont, but sadly you know exactly what is going to be dropped.",2016-09-30 19:24:05+00:00,d88opsx,5.0,t1_d88n10l,2261.0,TheHearth

Following this calculator for ancients: http://hsoptimizer.github.io/ancient/  

Can instakill pretty much to around Atlas 1350-1400 I belive, but often dont because im lazy with upgrading and often just watch a video and upgrade every now and then, so my runs are anywhere from 45 mins to 2-3 hours but can be 30-35 mins if I wanted to.

With one reroll of ancients I could get Revolc, the one that gives chance to get double rubies, with 2 I could get Morgulis. Current listing is Vaguur only semi-useful one, but I never use skills anymore XD, you completly turned me. 
My calc doesnt even list Revolc, so I am wondering if I should get Revolc or Morgulis? Or too early?",2015-10-22 17:05:51+00:00,cw9116q,2.0,t1_cw90b4h,1043.0,ClickerHeroes

http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/clickerheroes/ancientssoul.html 
http://hsoptimizer.github.io/ancient/ 
With the lowest level for every ancient between those two, and I got this: 

**Ancients**: Siyalatas (37); Mimzee (31); Libertas (30); Mammon (26); Dora (26);  

**Not Summoned**: Solomon, Khrysos, Thusia, Pluto, Dogcog, Fortuna, Atman, Bhaal, Morgulis, Chronos, Bubos, Fragsworth, Vaagur, Kumawakamaru, Chawedo, Hecatoncheir, Berserker, Sniperino, Kleptos, Energon, Argaiv, Juggernaut, Iris, Revolc;  

**Gilded Heroes**: Tree Beast (1), Ivan (1), Brittany (2), Seer (4), Natalia (2), Mercedes (4), Bobby (2), Broyle (2), Sir George (2), Referi (3);  

**Misc**: HS (2,189; Spent on Ancients: 2,392; Total: 4,640) HZE: 321; Current Zone: 220; Ascensions: 24; Rubies: 6, Immortal Damage: 1,457; Forge Cores: 251; Total Relics Found: 20;  

**Time Since Start**: 413d, 8h, 14m, 58s, Time since ascension: 1h, 16m, 16s;  

**Total Item Bonuses**: 

* +15% Primal Hero Souls
* -1% Boss Life
* +10% Idle DPS

476,"I personaly actualy think that the skill system should work like this: 
Take KD, SPM, KPM and then calculate the percentage of how much larger or smaller each of these stats were compared to your average on the battlelog page. 

Then combine all those percentages and thats how much skill you get, potentialy maybe take only 1/10th of that percentage number and thats the skill. 

So for example: 
Your average KD, SPM and KPM are 1, 500 and 0.5 
You get KD 2 in a game, SPM of 250 and KPM of 0.75
That means that your KD is +100%, your SPM is -100% and your KPM is +50% 
That would give you a total of +50% which would turn into +5 skill. 

Ofcourse for the system to work better then points from XP boosts would have to be calculated out of your SPM. 
And it would have to be individual skill values for each gamemode as they are all very different. So maybe you had a skill stat next to your gamemode score. 

I hope this made sense. And I know this doesnt show the current skill maybe exactly, but it shows how much the player is improving at the game.",2015-09-22 20:02:25+00:00,cvak7cv,1.0,t3_3ltx8n,94570.0,Battlefield_4_CTE
