I think this card could be very versatile, for example its main use will ofcourse be to buff a friendly minion, especialy one you might not need to attack with anyways but just want to give extra survivability to. You could also use it with Tundra Rhino to just make it a 1 mana +3/+2.

First off: I couldnt come up with a better, shorter name... 
Second: I wanted it to only destroy enemy minions at first, but I found it hard to balance around cards like deadly shot and assasinate with just that, for example 6 mana without the buff would have been a worse double deadly shot, though ofcourse in one card, and hey you could run both, and at 5 mana I felt it was too strong vs assasinate. So I decided on this, I still feel it might be too strong though, maybe at 7 mana?

Please dont suggest the two idle ancients, I am going to get them one day when its neccesary, but I dont feel like it is yet and I really love using skills, dont know why, but I do, thats why I have maxed Vaguur. Also probably not Juggernaut, as I dont feel like clicking all the time, I do know that you can get pretty close to permanent clickstorm right? But I am not there yet, so maybe later aswell. 

Or should I just level my current ancients more? I can reliably get to zone 250 in about 2 hours, can instakill up to zone 175 I belive. I can get about 300 souls in a 2 hour 20 min run up to zone 250, that was my last run. And it took me 15 min for max Frostleaf this time, but I belive I can do it in 10 mins and I just browsed around a bit so it added on the time, cant remember tho.

Also ignore the 413 day time since start, I havent played for a LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time, and came back about a week ago.
