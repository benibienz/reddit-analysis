There is always that one person. The 4th roommate was as inconsiderate as could be. He would always leave trash around the room, he would dirty every dish (he was the only one that ate in the room. We had meal plans) and would consequently overfill out 40 gallon trash bags. He would be very loud when we were trying to sleep. He would always open the fridge to see if anyone brought any food from home and ask ""dis yours?"" followed by ""dis have pork in it??"" Once the school year was finally coming to a close and it was some sort of Muslim holiday. He would leave his locked tablet on full volume and 5 times a day it would go off for him to pray to mecca. The problem with that is, is that he would never take his tablet out of the room. Since the tablet was locked we couldn't silence the app.

Time for the petty revenge. We started to hold the power button on his tablet every time he left the room so it would power off. We would pile his dirty dishes on his desk until he washed them. If there were papers on the floor, they went in the trash no questions asked. Our 4th roommate had a very musty smell to him so one of my roommates would douse #4's bed in lysol disinfectant once a day or else the scent would overwhelm the whole room. 
The cherry on top of this petty revenge was move out day. For about 8 months my 2 friends and I kept the room presentable. We always picked up before we left for a weekend, or helped each other tidy up before our girlfriends would come over. But #4 refused to participate, ""i didn't make a mess"" ""dats not mine"". So the second half of the second semester we just stopped cleaning. We went cold turkey. Then finals week came and we knew #4 was moving out Friday so we packed our stuff up and got out of there Thursday morning. The 3 of us left him a long afternoons worth of cleaning that had to be done by himself before the RA would sign off on him checking out. The school's policy is that the last person to check out is responsible for the room being cleaned.",pettyrevenge,College Roommate Revenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4pmolu/college_roommate_revenge/
