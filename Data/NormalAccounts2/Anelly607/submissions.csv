I live in a small town in New York with a mcdonalds close to where i live, being in high school and wanting the money i got a job. I started off working the counter, then i got moved to drive thru. to my pleasant surprise a lot of my co workers dipped on the job. So i picked up on this and would dip when i work the drive thru (I only took orders and did not handle food). the drive thru is in the back of the restaurant and your stuck in this box for hours so dipping was an amazing way to past time. One day i was asked to work the kitchen, i requested to use the bathroom so i could take out my dip and wash my hands. I get back to the kitchen and put on my gloves to see a surprise that was not so pleasant. Dip spit is everywhere, everyone but me had these huge fatties packed in there lip. i was appalled by what i was seeing. people would spit on the grill because it would go down to the grease traps. people would throw in dips in the kitchen and get pieces all over the ingredients. It was the most unsanitary thing i have ever witnessed. Ive even seen a coworker spit in a sandwich because a girl sent back an order because she was allergic to onions.
