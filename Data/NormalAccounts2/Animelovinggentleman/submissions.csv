I might, perhaps, introduce myself first before I disclose what my heart desires. My current name is Josh, but I prefer you called me Chesterton Yorkshire, since I will have it legally changed soon anyway. I consider myself to be an intellectual gentleman who was born in the wrong century but adapts to the current one as well as he can! The art of common courtesy and of treating a woman well was bestowed upon me by studying the behavior of great men in history. But I do not mimick them, only take subtle hints to model my behavior after them!

Although I consider myself to be an old soul, I love modern things as well. I am an avid fan of anime and video games. I also pretend to read a lot of books but it's mostly just reading summaries of them and then bragging about my broad knowledge about literature, which is true if you think about it! I plan on moving to London eventually, where I can pursue my dream of becoming a professional video game and anime reviewer. I do go to college and actually have an above average intelligence but instead of making something productive with it, I prefer reading japanese comics and playing obscure video games! I kinda get through my exams but becoming an engineer is not what I want to do in the end, since it's so boring!

As for you - if you are an asian woman, you do not need any further requirements except for not being ethnically arabian or Indian. Thai women are ok, but not preferred. If you are caucasian, you should have, preferrably, blonde hair, a slim figure with prominent bosom and bottom and a beautiful face. Characterwise you should be able to hold an intellectually stimulating conversation with me. This could mean two things - either you agree with me in my taste of entertainment completely and tell me how intelligent I am or, if you should disagree, you listen to me and don't question what I say. You are supposed to look good at all times, especially in front of my friends since I will present you around. At home we can play video games, watch anime or make love. You cook and clean.

If you read this and aren't a wretched harlot, I would like to read from you!

Greetings
