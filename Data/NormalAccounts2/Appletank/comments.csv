41,"Ehhhhh, I contest that RoF comment. One wouldn't call the Tiger P to be a DPM monster, but the 1945 has the exact same RoF. With terrible armor everywhere. At least the Tiger 1 has DPM.

All of the ARL's guns are fairly viable. Admittedly, the M6 has it beat in the DPM department with the 90 F3, but its turret is generally good enough to let you aim in a bit. The 105 makes you into a T-150 with gun depression and great frontal armor. The long 90 is generally considered a bad idea for the ARL unless you've been getting bot tier all day due to the gutting of DPM.

The way I played it was basically get up close around a corner, let people bounce, then move forward to take a shot. When top tier, you had a pretty good chance that you can just roll forward and bully low tiers. Bottom tier, angling your front can still pull off a few bounces. Being able to get close kinda helped in the bad accuracy department.

When I moved to the 1945, my frontal armor got flatter and weaker, and though it is basically an indication of how the autoloaders were going to be, the fact that you don't have an autoloader forced me to play a lot more cautiously.",2016-09-21 18:11:13+00:00,d7wbyuj,5.0,t1_d7w9r3u,2679.0,WorldofTanks

62,"Honestly, I went down this line just to be contrary. Plus, I tend to prefer RoF tanks because I hate the feeling of missing, but I will admit alpha tanks can play more safely.

Currently on the su-100m1 myself, it is ... workable. Fast with a decent gun, but it is vaguely disappointing looking at how the Su152's 122mm has nearly 3K dpm while the m1 is supposed to be the ""dpm"" one. Gun handling is amazing though, so many spinning and moving shots. I generally trust it enough to fire on the move when close.

I did grind the su-152 first because the 101 is stuck with the M1's stock gun if you didn't grind the su152 first. From what I've read, the 101's problem is that for even *worse* ammo prices, the 100mm does less damage than the 122mm gun. Along with its high RoF, yes it can melt tanks but the lower than average pen means that missing is extremely costly. Shell capacity is awful, too.

122-54 seems okay. You get the gun in the 101, so the grind won't be that bad. If you don't get hit, operating costs are actually cheaper. (nearly equal ammo costs, higher alpha)

Obj 263 is amazing, especially if you keep the lower glacis covered and sides protected. The entire top is at least 250mm, and over 300 in others. A number people haven't seen the thing (due to the 101), so they aren't exactly sure where to shoot at them. Also decent Horsepower, so it can bull rush people like a 100Y on steroids. Great accuracy, can snipe if you want to. Managed a few games with it in test servers, hella fun.

76,"Oh hey, this is a thing? Time for me to fanboi.

So far, I have claimed the unofficial spot as [Lord of Dorkness's](http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Lord+Of+Dorkness) #1 fanboy. About 2 and a half years ago, I stumbled onto the description of a intriguing sci fi fic. It was sparse, and the author himself admits he's not good at descriptions, but it advertized cyborg humans who look like ponies.

Ok, sure, I'll take a look.

I then proceeded to get hooked 3 or so pages into the first chapter. Dorky has a real talent for making his characters come alive, and puts a lot of effort into making their backstories consistent and intriguing. For this fic at least, he also put in a ton of effort into making it fairly hard sci-fi. The only thing he really hand waves on is quantum technology and propulsion.

tldr, 8 humans from the 21st century saw that the clunky, ugly, and frankly less advanced technology of Cybernetics  will pay far greater dividends in the long run than drugs and biological life extension. However, they fell heavily into the uncanny valley. Solution? Well, G4 pony designs are free now, why not?

300 years later a rage-eared Captain needs to recruit a few crew members for an experimental FTL spacecraft, and well, he does need the best of the best... Pity the fool who breaks the law to slow him down.

And then I found out there's no more chapters. Wanting more, I read another of his fic, Horse Feathers. Then his crack fic, Ironically Bad. Then I caved in to read his Five Score alternate universe, and that was awesome too (Alt because he has a bit of a gripe with how most people seemed to hide from their family, and does away with it by making it near public knowledge from the first week onwards. Daring Do of Australia became the first to be given sapient rights.)

If there is a flaw, I must say that he doesn't like Celestia very much, and it shows. He also has a tendency for the Quiet Fury Archetype that is most of his main characters.",2016-07-22 01:51:49+00:00,d5lsmc9,1.0,t3_4ty85f,29318.0,mylittlepony

197,"Looking at this thread, I've noticed a rather low amount of talk about the higher tier French arty (6+) (Low tiers are still a bit meh in quality, though they get a really nice high reload Tier 5 105mm spammer)

I have hopped on from the AMX 12t branch onto the AMX 13 F3

The French Arty have been said to have decent accuracy, ROF and mobility. Personally, the only truly consistent thing they have throughout the upper tiers is mobility. If you need to bugger it out of there, or just run across the map into a cleared area for a better shot, or run ahead of a few medium tanks to go arty hunting, these arty can do it with ease no matter which tier, and always better than everyone else.

Accuracy is a bit of a crap shoot, especially when you compare them to some of the stock guns the US line has. Heck, some of them even have better RoF with their stock guns than some of the French's top guns. You really only start noticing the accuracy once you get to Tier 9, since you get a full turret. Therefore, whenever possible, move around, stay as close as you can to the front lines w/o being spotted in order to keep that gun firing, because you simply don't have the splash to afford a miss.

Also, if you want to look at vehicle stats, Tanks.gg is a very nice site for that stuff.

On a side note, the T57 is amazingly fun.

On another side note, the Batchat 58 is the only arty that can create the same moments of terror the T49 causes when one sneaks behind you. 4 times. Because autoloader. And medium tank mobility.",2015-08-25 03:22:20+00:00,cuep8lz,1.0,t3_3i99ee,18706.0,WorldofTanks

204,"I don't tend to drive the Lee/Grant much, but when I did, I did pretty well in them. Just play the Lee like a TD, and you're fine. 92 pen at Tier 4 is pretty good.

38 NA was a nightmare for me, since I was relatively new to the game at the time, and could barely pen anything. Never found out that I should use the 2nd gun for better mobility until a year later.

I unlocked the M5 Stuart a few months back to try out the US Light line, and I really didn't have too much trouble with it, despite it having even worse pen than the NA. I just drove around like a maniac and ambushed whoever had low armor. I was actually kinda sad to move on.

Duck was terrible. Not fast enough to get anywhere, gun is barely usable above Tier 5, and you will see a lot of Tier 6, and most people can easily shoot right through you. Plus, shit RoF for such a weedy gun.

Ironically, I decided to challenge myself by using the 75 derp on the DW2 to see if I can get better results. Short answer, I did. With the occasional Heat to surprise medium tanks or other DW2s and B1s, I have managed to get twice the average damage, a half way decent Kill/game ratio, and annoyingly the same winrate.

Got the t28 after I had the T-34, so for me, it was a less armored T-34 at a lower tier. It was fun. Not sure how fun it would be if I tried using the 76mm howitzers, though seeing how all of them have terrible DPM, probably not a good idea in any respect.

B1 was also a struggle, because it was really slow. Felt like the Duck with a crappier gun.

I drove the Valentine to get the Bishop. Every game was pain, because while I might be able to pen someone, the RoF for such a tiny gun was god-awful. This was a Matilda with nearly everything worse besides being marginally faster.
