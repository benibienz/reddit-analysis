--How does this scale down to lower caliber HE, like 105 mm?

2) Does this apply to the other thin skinned vehicles? aka, would it now be a good idea to load HE to laugh at a side-scraping Leopard, or a hulldown Obj 140? Is there a ratio to gun caliber size to armor one should follow (ex. if the super-angled armor is 30mm, don't try HE unless gun 100+ mm)

If true, we may need to load a lot more HE shells to compensate for the new mechanics. ",WorldofTanks,Question about new Overmatch differences,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/5duabc/question_about_new_overmatch_differences/

I've heard that for the crossbow, it is roughly 16hp -&gt; 1%, up to 9% max per shot. Generally, 90hp or so is about average, so about 5% to 6% every 2 sec.

I've haven't gotten much info on Amputator rates, but after a bit of using the taunt while near several injured teammates, I think the uber charges just the slightest bit faster. Not sure if there's an easy number on when Amp taunting becomes slightly faster (and argueably better at keeping people alive) than healing everyone one by one.

I've managed to burst up to nearly 30% in 10 sec lobbing bolts at injured people and overhealing anyone I walk past, so I'm pretty sure its quite possible to pull your charge time to be lower than, say, 40 sec for the Medigun, but I don't have a way of getting a bunch of people to test it with a stopwatch.

Artillery still works as usual. RNG fest.

Everyone else gets one or two slowly charging artillery consumable.


Once someone targets an area (kinda big circle) with the consumable, though, all artillery get a RoF bonus (or sudden autoloader mode) only when (locked) inside circle. First shell fired into circle keeps you in the circle. Also 80% cheaper ammo when in circle (this may require you to have a healthy supply of shells, or a bonus for that too). If you can't hit the spot, then the bonus becomes goes away after 10 sec or something.

This therefore simulates the whole bombardment thing when you use the consumable. 

Dunno, seemed like an okay compromise between:

* Big guns still being big, but unreliable as usual when there is no teamwork. So those 200mm mortars aren't as frustrating when a shell goes flying off into nowhere, but probably a lot funner when you can fire like, 4 of them at one big spot despite still having terrible accuracy.

* War Thunder's and certain WoT mode's bombardment ability, which I haven't really seen complaints to the level of arty.

* A timer/alert telling you where a place is going to be covered in shells, as in AW

1) All crew skills are attached to the commander (since every tank has one, but not all tanks have a loader, radioman, etc).

2) However, you still need said crew in order to use and train said skill. Ex: Adrenaline Rush, but no loader, so that does nothing.

3) Which skill that's activated is optional. However skills there are depends on Commander training. If the Commander has enough xp for 3 skills, so do the rest of the crew. How much a skill gets trained operates normally.

Mostly because some tanks switch crew members around, and its gets annoying when BiA gets skipped or whatever.",WorldofTanks,Crew Skill arrangement idea,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/3j0qjp/crew_skill_arrangement_idea/
