1,2016-11-18 09:14:01+00:00,self.PokemonCreate,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonCreate/comments/5dlixf/changes_to_rules_a_few_announcements_please_read/,False,"Hey guys, us mods of /r/PokemonCreate were discussing a few things happening with the sub including changes to rules and also a few announcements that we would like to say.


###Changes to rules:


Firstly, Rule 7 states that ""Make sure items that you have requested are not items that wouldn't go through the GTS... for example, Mega Stones"". We have been lenient about this rule as we allowed FC trading to occur but we have decided that people who requests items that are not GTS tradable, will be prioritized last or if need be, just be given their pokemon without the item. This is because there are other subreddits out there who you can make a post on asking for a particular item. /r/PokemonCreate was based on the idea of trading Pokemon through GTS and so we would like to keep it that way. Also, we have seen requests of people who want a particular item but would not be on for a long while so we would have to wait for them to get on, add us and trade with us. Essentially, we are making it easier for us to give out pokemon as we do not want to add 10 people a day just to give an item to you.

Secondly, people who ask for events with ribbons will be prioritized last as well. As stated above, we do not want to add 10 people a day and would prefer it to be traded on the GTS. If you do not mind events without ribbons, then this change does not apply to you but if you do want a legit clone of an event with ribbons, note that your request will be put last on the To Do list until our genners have fulfilled everyone's request. 

###Announcements

Thirdly, as the release of sun and moon is upon us (well some countries anyway), it is clear to us that some people are eager to request gen 7 pokemon. Please note that our team does not have Sun and Moon yet as most of us are either in the US or Europe so we are getting the game late. So we advise you that do not request Gen 7 pokemon until a week has past from the 18th of November 2016. This is to give our genners time to complete the game, have fun with it and experience the things that you guys with the game have before actually starting on requests.

Fourthly, In addition to the announcement above, it will be clear that some people will not get the game until much later. This means that there will be Gen 6 and Gen 7 requests happening at the same time. We will do our best to fulfill both generations but in the future, we will be only doing gen 7 games. This is because we will find it difficult to switch games every time and so will just make it easier to do Gen 7.

I hope you guys are all understanding of the Changes and Announcements and I hope that this will not deter you from using our sub. Our team just think that theses changes will be beneficial for them and also for you.

We have implemented this rule as the mods here have seen multiple cases of people using alternative accounts to request more than the daily amount (2 per 24 hours). We didn't think we had to put this rule into place for a while but seeing as some people are just being to greedy now, we are now taking more precautions to make sure that you guys are following the rules. 

Thank you all for reading this and I hope that you guys will be understanding of why we have put this rule in place. We are just trying to make this subreddit more enjoyable for you guys and I hope that this will not discourage you from using this sub.

You can just ask for 3 pokemon to be genned and i will try and gen them. I can probably do this for 2-3 people if i don't mess it up XD. It may take a while though so bare with me

EDIT: Okay, I have Enough People Now so any new people who asks will not get their pokemon genned. I will probably do this again in 2 hours so if you want to, you can wait XD
