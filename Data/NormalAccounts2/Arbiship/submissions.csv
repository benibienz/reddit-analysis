* The software is for e-commerce automation, specifically eBay and Amazon. 

* The current website is www.arbiship.com

* Our service is treading unknown territory in many ways. There are a few competitors, but so far there is nobody else who can offer what we offer (probably because it's incredibly hard to do). Lots of opportunity here.


We are looking for a strong and **experienced** marketer. No bullshit. You need to know your stuff and I will test you on it because I also know some stuff, so please only apply if you really know what you're doing and can think long term. 

Affiliate marketing, PPC marketing, email marketing, forum posts, Reddit, etc. You will do anything and everything that can bring targeted &amp; interested email addresses into our website.


**Requirements:**

* At least 6 months of real marketing experience. (Marketing for an SaaS gets you extra cookie points).

* Hard worker.

* Wants to do something with big opportunity and not just looking for an expendable salary.

If you can fulfill the requirements above please send a PM with your qualifications.


Our office is in Israel, but we are happy to work with anyone from anywhere who is right for the job.
