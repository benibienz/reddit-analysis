1,"That's unfortunate. Rather spend some of my paycheck on Fallout 4 now, and then get the Anthology. Thanks!",2015-11-03 13:07:49+00:00,cwmt2r1,2,t1_cwmt197,112,gaming
2,"For $2000, why don't you go with Skylake?

EDIT: If you want to get into Streaming or Video Editing, you can go with a 6700k, but a 6600k should be more than enough for gaming. You can also change the cooler if you like air better than water. Also, you can fit a 980 Ti in your budget, which will be MORE than enough to run Fallout 4 maxed out, along with 99% of other games too.
