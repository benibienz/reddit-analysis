However, when reading about the Anthology, I came across this on the website:

&gt; Packaged in an exclusive mini-nuke storage case, complete with audible bomb sound and a space reserved to add your copy of Fallout 4, this is the ultimate collectible for Fallout fans.

Does this mean that the Anthology doesn't come with Fallout 4 when it's released, and I have to buy Fallout 4 separately? If that's the case, then I'll wait to purchase the Anthology after Fallout 4 releases.

- Helmet + Facemask

- Stick

- Gloves
