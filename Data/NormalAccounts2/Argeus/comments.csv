0,"Because a lot of compers want to keep wearing the best cape in the game but not do the work for keeping it. They try to whine Jagex to submission in an effort to stay lazy. I really hope Jagex doesn't cater to these people. Then comp cape can only be worn by those who deserve it.

If you are too busy with life or whatever then you shouldn't be wearing the cape. It's supposed to be a symbol for players who are active and completed the game. I don't see people with quest capes whining after every new quest is released.

These people give genuine compers a bad name.",2016-11-19 19:46:03+00:00,da7a3z4,1,t3_5dsq72,18054,runescape

38,"I only use degradable stuff on the tougher slayer monsters. Usually, I just get a level 75 weapon the monster is weak to (max combat levels). 

If the monster's weakness is not slash, you are hampering your XP rate and slowing yourself down with SGS, especially for high level slayer tasks. You make up the cost and make more money usually too from the tasks so I would at least recommend using the monsters weakness and food. Combat pots are helpful too.

Drygore makes the tasks a lot faster and you don't have to worry about weaknesses anymore. If you have the money I would say get Drygore. You will will buy them later anyway and you said you have the money. Drygore prices are low too now, so now would be a good time to get them.

tl;dr Drygore is obviously the best you can get for slayer, and they do make the tasks a whole lot faster. If not drygores, atleast use the monsters weakness you don't have full accuracy againt them.",2016-04-20 18:09:06+00:00,d2ambiq,1,t3_4fo4e5,6681,runescape
