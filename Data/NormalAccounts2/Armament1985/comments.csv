3,1 month for f2p player means you miss 800 crystals from arena (considering you do it religiously and get good rank) 750 crystals from dailies and with the new update 180 270 360 bios depending on how many missions the character you're farming is in.  Without even counting the gold and antimatter you lose i dont think its even worth it to be away for a month just for the 5* hero selector,2015-10-06 21:22:55+00:00,cvqk7ut,1,t3_3noq2r,43290,FutureFight
