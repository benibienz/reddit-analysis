Was also wondering how people usually farm characters to get them to the awesome 5-6 star that i usually see in arena seems to be taking forever for me :(

So i downloaded whats app just to try to send an invite to a friend who i knew was playing as well and found out that it generates a link that people have to click for them to join the game.

After having my friend join i copied the link and sent it to some friends through facebook and when they clicked it they were able to join too!

With this i guess one way for us to get people we know to play the new multiplayer function with us is to just copy the generated links for the game you create and then send it through other means even SMS messages would work.

On a note tho people using bluestacks will have to go to the link through the bluestacks browser.

hope this was helpful!
