Like how The Stability and Growth Pact is another treaty, entirely different to the EU treaties with provisions in that very treaty that make Germany's acting completely legal and compliant with the rules.

Despite that Germany ran a government budget deficit in excess of 3% of GDP in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2010, a full five of the treaty's seventeen years and has had a national debt of more than 60% of GDP for very nearly the whole time, for very nearly the whole time in breach of Germany's Stability and Growth Pact obligations.

Completely compliant with a German reading of the rules, no doubt.
