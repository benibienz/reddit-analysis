110,"Omg! xxx

I just checked some of your posts and it looks like we're both probably in the same boat! Not entirely of course, I've realized that I am trans for about a week now, I think. And you for 6+ months. So time wise, you're definitely ahead of me.

Even though I feel like we're both going through roughly the same thing, I have trouble picking something to share with you that over-confidently tells me, will help you. So I will just focus on the ''emotionally broken'' statement in my previous post.

I feel like a past experience in my life which I remember vividly has emotionally ''bottlenecked'' me. Not entirely sure if this has effected my trans discovery. I believe the emotionally scarring experience was me finding out the truth about our Society on a geo-political scale. I was digging into ''conspiracy theories'' (Dislike the term, because it's used to discredit anti-government speech) at the time, which had so much effect on me that it emotionally crippled me in a way I cannot really pin-point.

Any who, I just feel like that stuff put me at an emotional disadvantage for a while, which is now going in reverse. I feel like me finding out and accepting that I am a woman has really positively increased the strength of my emotions and has almost completely nullified any negative emotional disadvantages that I got from my ''Theory'' days.

If you can relate with that, it may help you.

Maybe you can relate to my current experience; This past week in my life has been going insanely fast. At some point I was constantly doubting my Dysphoria, while a part of my brain kept trying to tempt me to go back how things used to be. A few hours ago, however, I realized that my brain systematically has difficulty handling big changes and that it would always tempt me with the way things used to be. Often in the past, I've had my complete worldview crumbled and changed, at the start, my brain would always reject and deny the changes, which would give me mental problems and struggles. But always a few days/a week later, my brain will have accepted the changes and I will almost completely forget ever having had troubles with these changes.

Realizing this has made me happier being a woman, because I know that I will accept it eventually.",2016-05-09 04:09:56+00:00,d2y8fhg,4.0,t1_d2y75tx,2482.0,asktransgender

My cousin refused at first, because the dude was hinting gay sex, and my cousin is pretty experimental, but only when it comes to drugs.

If you do get past that stage I suggest getting a buttplug set, because transitioning from 1-3 fingers to cock sized things in your asshole can be quite rough, lengthy, inefficient and at times simply not pleasurable. It takes some time before you can actually comfortably take a dildo in your ass. But as long as you do your best to relax and stretch your ass as much as comfortably possible during anal sessions you will get there quick.

Use actual lube. Other stuff has a minor chance of causing infections.

2 very important tips.

1. Buy dildos, never try to make your own play-toys. Especially not scratch shit. i.e half a toothbrush buttplug. If that shit comes loose inside you, you won't have a comfortable experience getting it back out again. I had it happen once and I had a full on panic attack after thinking of some ER stories that I read. Was shaking for 2 hours afterwards. (Don't worry, this is not a risk if you aren't retarded like me)

214,"He does actually raise a valid point with the nofap thing.

I recently discovered that I am a transgender through Goddess Lucie/Gracie hypnos. Since this side of me has only recently come out while I was high, I am giving it and the feelings it harbors some time to settle down and grow before I go cold turkey on masturbation, porn and hypnos. While I am going Cold turkey on that, I will pickup a hypertrophy training program for those 3 months so I can get fit. Mens sana in corpore sano.

BTW, The effect of sissy hypnos is a 2-sided argument. One side says that it's classical conditioning using the dopamine/opioid receptors in your brain. The other says that it simply awakens ''repressed'' or simply never discovered parts of you. (Both sides are pretty biased when you really look at it) But, I am going to test this idea for myself by going cold turkey as described above. I really hope that after those 3 months my brain still sees that I am transgender.

If it's a video made by one of the most popular ''sissification activists'' checking this link will probably help  https://www.reddit.com/r/sissyhypno/wiki/index.compact (It's filled with visual sissification goodness)

If you can't find it there I suggest going to popular sites for sissy videos (i.e. XVideos/pornhub) and filtering your searches to (in case of xvideos 10+) 15/20+ minutes and use keywords such as sissy/sissification.

I'm sorry for not being able to help you further along your way. But hopefully while searching for your long lost fap loooove ^.^   you'll find more amazing sissy hypnos along the way!!!

It will definitely take some time before your clitty stops getting hard, but once you do finally succeed. It will be so rewarding!
