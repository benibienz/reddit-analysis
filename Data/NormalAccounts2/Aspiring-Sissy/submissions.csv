When I am talking about security I am talking about physical and software security. In regards of physical security, I presume I know enough there. I suppose rooting my device and then installing and rooting the hidden version of cerberus (Maybe AL?) on it and getting some better password protection will suffice (Perhaps if you are a masochist or overly protective a piece of hardware for remote detonation of your device can be the cherry on the cake?)


In regards of software security however I am barely in the know. I know that rooting your phone is a must in regards of optimizing your software security and that by doing so you can gain access to permanently removing a lot of the privacy-killing bloatware that comes pre-installed with any Android device. And that there are ways for you to freeze apps that kill your privacy and ways limit installed software's access to your device.


Any help/advice regarding physical &amp; data security is highly appreciated!

So this will probably be a messy post.

Recently, 3 days ago, I discovered that I want to be a woman. Ever since then I've felt this sense of fulfillment, acceptance, giddyness and especially euphoria whenever I think about the fact that I want to be a woman. But at the same time I have this constant feeling of ''despair'' or depressed feeling which I can only describe to be nervousness and uncertainty both at the same time. That feeling is really eating on me and has been the main motivator as to why I am writing this. I've thought a lot about what could cause this feeling to appear and I've not been able to find a clear cut answer as for why these negative feelings are nearly constantly here. The closest answer I could find was the fact that when I completely relax, remove outside influences and my ego from my conscious mind, I would basically only feel that '' euphoric happiness'' as I described a short while ago. When that happens I feel completely relaxed, calm, happy, accepting of death etc. Euphoric basically. Man I am repeating myself now. Anywho, usually after an hour of feeling euphoric, thoughts of doubt and uncertainty creep in again. Primarily thoughts such as; ''What if the feelings of wanting to become a woman leave???, I don't want it to leave!!!'' 
The worst part of thoughts like that is that I don't know if it originates from the right place or the wrong place inside of me. Is it the social construct me that is clinging onto its last breaths or is it &gt;me&lt; telling me that I am not actually a woman, even though a rather powerful feeling inside of me is telling me I am.

Hopefully I've given a pretty clear view of how things are now. That way I can tell you about how I got to this point my ''Origins'' story if you want to put it like that.

Since a couple of months ago I got into sissy hypnos. It was a bit of an on and off relationship. Sometimes I'd watch and regret watching it afterwards and other times I would have periods during which I didn't touch the genre at all, but my fap interests were always specifically centered around TG (SIDENOTE: ''Played quite a bit of Trap Quest'') and some very obscure fetish. before I ever found out about sissyhypnos I would occasionally cross-dress, but that would only happen when I had refrained from fapping for 4 days to 2 weeks. SIDENOTE: ''I specifically remember that I enjoyed feeling pretty while doing so.'' Anyway, please know that I've given that bit of background information so I can get to the important part, which was the last 4 weeks up until now. 4 weeks ago I decided to start nofap/no porn (For the most part noporn) my main motivation being the whole Opioid/Dopamine system rewiring your brain article which I read about on a nofap site (Don't want to go back there, it makes me feel negative) I read it because I was fapping to some weird shit, so I thought that a 3 month nofap would definitely rewire my brain to its natural state. But when my Ergonomics doctor, who I went to regarding my RSI, told me that I cannot game for the next 2 weeks (Or stress my right arm at all for that matter.) During those 2 weeks I had Holiday. So, I thought; ''No Gaming during my vacation? Fuck, I'm going to relapse.'' And that's exactly what happened. I relapsed on the very first fucking saturday even. Didn't even regret it for a bit afterwards. On that following Monday however I purged. SIDENOTE: ''In the sense of deleting all the content/browser history and regretting my relapse a bit.'' This after purge purity continued until Wednesday when my mind pulled me back and brilliantly decided to start considering to involve weed into the equation. Absolutely no stopping my desires for this experimentation I got me some money and bought me some quality weed with a friend of mine. He smoked a bit of the stash with me. He is completely ignorant regarding my motive etc. (SIDENOTE: ''He was there Friday to sunday'') during which I strangely had gay fantasies about him. (BIG SIDENOTE: ''Remember, that what I just said was last week. FYI Timelines can be a little fucked up because I always binged on hypnos/audios during the following nights. My brain's a little hazy regarding times. + On that sunday I decided to finally start strictly following the sissy feminization program I found online somewhere'') 
After those days I used the remaining part of the stash to get high while watching hypnos and listening to feminization audio files. SIDENOTE: ''I vividly remember that right before everytime I did that I had to calm my eagerness down before I could get into it, so I could avoid bad trips i.e nasty heart palpitations.'' Anyway, Tuesday was the last day of me getting high while listening to feminization audio files. But it was also the strongest, I remember that during that day (SIDENOTE: ''Or the night before, not sure.'') I calmly listened to a one and a half an hour estrogen beat release file after which I certainly felt more female (INTERESTING SIDENOTE: ''Has/had me thinking of the possibility that the added estrogen has caused a hormonal imbalance inside me thus resulting in my current confusion'') but that's not all, because on that Tuesday night (Or morning) I listened to an audio file which I feel like changed my life (SIDENOTE: ''I believe it was made by Goddess Lucie.'') the file was about letting my inner woman out and it feels like it actually did. In the file it described euphoria, fulfillment etc. I felt everything it described so intensely. When my inner woman was coming out, I felt a part of me struggling at first, but as soon as I once again turned off my brain, everything became so intensely blissful and I felt so fulfilled. The next day I was doing pretty fine, I felt like I had to give the woman inside of me more room to breathe by shoving my ''ego'' aside. Had some strange fears saying that perhaps the woman inside was too submissive to come out etc. During that whole day however I didn't feel even a bit of despair, just acceptance, I was just spending the day making it more clear to myself that I am a woman. The kind of despair I described a while ago. But the day after that, that's when the situation started to worsen. Doubts started entering, only little by little, but barely noticeable. On that very day though I told a friend of mine that I am transgender, because a strong feeling inside of me told me that I had to and it was eating on me rapidly, so I gave in. After I basically; ''came out'' I felt soooooo relieved and fulfilled. He knew I had doubts so he helped me create a plan of what to do for the next 3 months and that's pretty much hypertrophy training combined with nofap/noporn. He said; ''Mens sana in Corpore Sano.'' And I agreed. The following day however (SIDENOTE: ''Still pretty much today, because the last time I slept was on the night I made those plans with that friend'') is when the despair fully kicked in and now everything is as I described, in this post a long way back up.

Essentially, I am pretty sure that I am depressed. And I don't know whether the depression is indicating that I am on the path to becoming me or if it's indicating that I am becoming not me.

BTW, as of late, I've barely been eating anything.

Not sure if this subreddit is the right place. So please excuse me if this is not the right place for this type of post.

If you were able to follow the whole story, I congratulate you. Right now I am not in a good state for making things very constructive. I made this post on a rather emotional basis and I apologize profusely for that, since that's a reason as to why this post is such a confusing mess. From the moment I post this I will regularly improve any mistakes I've made and make things more clear if they were unclear.
