We have to go back in time, quite a ways back, to the emergence of terrestrial animals, keep in mind that evidence has shown that leg like structures actually evolved prior to land species. Some of these  intermediary species had an environment were being born with strong back legs that allowed them to jump was favored, and therefore that mutation was passed on, thus, giving the emergence over NUMEROUS generations eventually developing into frogs as we know them today, which infact are changing as we speak as are we as well. The other groups of intermediate amphibian species X as I will designate it lived in an environment that not having strong back legs was okay, so that group developed and branched into what we now know as salamanders. So in summary, some amphibians flourished with back legs that allowed for jumping as a form of locomotion and some flourished where that adaptation was not needed. Also, remember that species do not choose what is adaptive, but factors in their environment, whether biotic or abiotic choose what is adaptive.",2015-10-04 03:55:18+00:00,cvngjck,11.0,t1_cvnfgoz,2300.0,explainlikeimfive

Evolution is based off a species keeping up with its environment based on favorably mutated offspring of which are not willingly mutated. And that those favored by the environment will produce more offspring that are favored.
