so I was watching some brodual videos about mods, deciding which ones I want and all and, in his ""top mods of 2015"" video I noticed what looks to be some sort of stealth/theif/assassin armour from the 4:53 mark to about the 5:11 mark.

Knowing it was buggy from my laptop which had win8.1 I went with win7 pro to prevent these boot up problems. And all was well, until a few days ago, when I decided I wanted to mod fallout 3. 
  So, I followed that Ultimate steam modding guide by BenWah (to the tee, might I add) and it worked for that night then the next morning it wouldn't launch properly saying that a folder wasn't in the right place and so I checked and it was which bothered me. Then, I thought well I'll just reinstall and wipe all the mods, or any trace of fallout 3 from my pc. About an hour later, fallout is reinstalled and it ran the graphics test and set its self quality wise what it would run at and then I launched the game. Then, problem numero dos  arose, it gets to that first screen then crashes and says my pc has problems running fallout. So I thought well I'll restart my pc and run it again, got nothing then I resorted to the fix where you change bUseThreadedAI=0 to 1 and that didn't work( I also added the line after that.). Once again, I got the same message on boot up. Then, I figured well it must be a bad download. so I reinstalled, and well nothing.
   And, that brings me to now, lost, confused, and quite frankly beat all because I simply wanted to enjoy the game that honestly made me want to ascend to PCMR all those years ago. what do PCMR? what do?

* Gaming. specifically games like the fallout and elder scrolls series, looking at modding for quality of gameplay and visuals. as well as the GTA series, The Forest, and Farcry would be the most taxing games I would play. hoping for ultra or high settings. definitely want it to be able to run fallout 4 but I don't think it would be too much to ask.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* 750 USD max. really can't go much higher.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* I plan on heading to Microcenter Friday

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

* Tower

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* Illinois, USA, about an hour from St. Louis, which has a Microcenter 

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing?**

 * A basic logitech keyboard and mouse however, I plan on upgrading to new peripherals at the middle to end of the month. Also, I am using a 720p tv for now also upgrading soon and then I plan on switching to dual monitors of a medium size 19""-24"") HDMI is preferred and willa lso probably still connect my TV from time to time to my rig after that. Monitor suggestions are also accepted but please don't add them to the grand total

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Yes, but down the road a ways or if I need to for more taxing games

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* Ideally I want to have a small SSD for my OS (at this point windows 7) but will upgrade to windows 10 when released. I also want to have an HDD for everything else (games etc)

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* the very basics really, Mid-sized, preferably cheaper with maximum amount of usb 3 and HDMI ports possible. Also, no window or LEDs and I need a place for a disk drive

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

* Nope, I have a copy of Win7 pro

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**
* I will need a disk drive",buildapcforme,I was asked to submit at a later date. so here goes (700-750 USD gaming),http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/3bjj48/i_was_asked_to_submit_at_a_later_date_so_here/
