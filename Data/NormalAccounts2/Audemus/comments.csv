0,"Mixed elements is fine as long as you're not fighting something that has alternating weaknesses/resists.  In the arena mixing them gives me versatility and that's what I'm equipped for.  Would I like Agrias' TM to use as an offhand to Moonblade?  Sure, I would, but I haven't finished it yet so that's a moot point.
  
As for calling me a whale, feel free if you want, but I only pulled 2 times for Luneth, 3 for Lightning, 4 for Ramza/Delita.  Amazon coins save you a ton of money.  The fact I have 4 fencers is a happy mistake, I didn't get Thief and in the last 5 minutes of the banner decided one more pull to get him.  I got 3 of her in that one pull, that's why their TM's all misaligned on percentage complete, I used the moogles from Maxwell to catch up the second one so I'd have two of the materia for now.
  
You'll notice no DKC or Elza, I didn't get DKC and I only pulled one time on the Brave Frontier banner.  Whales don't do that in my experience.  I pick and choose what I will go for, as it stands now my team is right where I want it so short of some nostalgia triggering character coming up I'll just be running events and farming TM's from here on out.",2016-11-20 00:26:21+00:00,da7l2t1,5,t1_da7ko0h,642,FFBraveExvius
1,"Even more amusing is his lack of an actual sword being equipped...there's a reason I went through the blood sweat and tears to finish off Moonblade.  Luneth gains 20% atk when using a sword from his passive Swordmaster.
  
Given, he's trying to make up for it with blade mastery but it shows a fundamental lack of understanding for the characters built in skills.  Had he taken Moonblade with blade mastery/Sakura he would be an even bigger nightmare.  His 2 Celestial Gloves are really the monstrous part, despite the obvious materia, as my Luneth would get relatively close to his without Blade Mastery if they were available.  
  
I still have 2 Lunge Combos, the aforementioned Brave Suit, and accessories to finish as I'm not focusing on Blade Mastery at this point.  I'd like to wait and see if that Heavy Armor/Sword materia in JP ends up stacking for us first.

Target, for instance, is open very late and if you buy a soda there and ask for a bag/receipt it seems like you could use this as a way of proving you are a ""current patron"" of The Prado shopping center.  As they have not specified a measurable unit of time, I would argue a 24 hour/once a day window on a purchase could be argued as current.

19,"Thank you for the kind words and GGG for putting up with me for so long making it.  There were three other unique ideas that got turned down before Daresso's Defiance and I actually waited a good 3-4 months before proposing a retaliation based chest because I wanted to get a feel for how the game was on release, since it was in beta before.
  
My other favorite idea was ""A Brace of Wands"" a single item that took up both weapon slots and had two complimenting wand stats that would build build up damage as they stacked on each alternating hit.  I even designed a rendered mock up for it based on a flintlock pistol merged with a wand, basically bringing the idea of a wandslinger to an exaggerated level.  
  
[Mock Up of one of the wands](http://i.imgur.com/dhy93ph.png)
  
Release swallowed that one whole as it fell by the wayside and Daresso's Defiance was initially on Exquisite Leather and looked much different than what it looks like today.

That's all I needed to see and I've respected the edge of every knife, weapon or not, since then.

 &amp;nbsp;

So here we go, I found some pretty interesting (I think?) things and was able to find a marking on the sword; although it was hidden from sight and not on the Tang.  I took shots of absolutely everything I could think of to make sure that we had as much information as possible and I have not re-assembled it in case you have further requests before I put it back together.

Yet the moment you put the thing together all of that is pretty much wiped out from view and it doesn't have the option to leave the top of the hull unglued like the Valkyrie.  You can't leave the entire hull unglued down the center due to the cockpit being locked into place as it is designed to be a primary bind point for the Arvus.

I chose a standard gemstone color for both their shields and axes as it made sense that they would use a gemstone common to their territory as an adornment instead of rare stones which would be used in trade.
  
They also are close in color scheme to my Legion of Azgorh so that I can run them together if I decide to but as the armies accumulate enough models to support themselves I will most likely steer away from that.
  
Now if I could just decide what colors to use for my Fyreslayers hair!  I've tested a white/dark orange but after 3 days of looking at the mode to make sure I liked it...I'm not thrilled with it.

72,"Yep!  I didn't think you were calling me out at all; in fact if anything, you helped me out by making me type out what I was already thinking as I'm sure it will need to be explained why these ridiculous little 10 man squads are able to dive behind the walls and soak up more template fire than a person can shake a stick at.

If I end up making three squads of these guys to complete the Tercio it could get rather insane for any infantry coming near the Aegis, 120 shots at BS4 re-rolling misses on 1's, and then when they go to push them out they can all hit the dirt and continue to hit on 6's with 1's still being re-rolled.  I'd probably need a separate cup with 120 uniform colored dice just to complete their attacks!  Haha
  
Combine that with my intent to place Rapier batteries behind the ADL and utilizing deep striking Tarantulas as active defend and attack units, I could create a crossfire for any troops attempting to encroach on the ADL.  Vehicles shouldn't be a problem with the Stormhammer lurking around and my armoured column supporting it.
  
A Tercio with 3 Rotor Cannon Veletaris units and an ADL w/ the ammunition dump is 415 points with the supporting deep-striking Tarantulas equipped with multi-lasers being 150 Points.  That's not a bad exchange for the sheer amount of anti-troop fire power it provides and being able to drop the Tarantulas as separate units lets me spread them out to avoid being overrun.  I'm liking this more and more...",2016-02-09 21:37:45+00:00,czty39j,4,t1_cztwjsz,2059,Warhammer

I have an Arvus on the way that's going to be a drop-ship for my Household Retinue and I'm also toying with the idea of using Tarantulas as active response units as they come in 1-3 per Fast Attack slot and can have multiple deployment choices.
  
Can we say [Sentry Guns](http://i.imgur.com/G5aPUFL.png) around the deepstrike landing zone of the Arvus?! Haha",2016-02-09 21:20:02+00:00,cztxak9,2,t1_cztshuu,6360,Warhammer
74,"Oh the confusion is coming from Household Guard vs. Veletaris, as they are two entirely different units even though they use the same model.  The Veletaris squad can be placed inside of a Auxiliary Infantry Tercio which consists of 1-3 Troop Section choices (the only oddity being the Flamer Section which is considered a ""Support Section"" and requires a Lasrifle section to be used), 0-1 Dracosans or 0-1 Aegis Defense Lines.
  
The Household Retinue, who have preferred enemy(infantry) while the Lord Marshal is present on the table, are an Elite troop choice upgraded from the Veletaris that do not count against the Tercio's but they can only take either an Arvus or Dracosan (no ADL).  So 
  
I guess while I could use up all my Elite Troop slots on single squads of Veletaris w/ Rotor Cannons it would cost me in troop slots and remove the benefits of the Aegis Defense Line as well as using only 1 troop organization slot for 3 potential squads with the ADL.  In the organization I've decided on, I could also use the Elite troop slots on Auxiliae Medicae and Rapier batteries that could support my troops in the ADL (I really don't like the Ogryn model, so Charonites won't happen sadly).

I agree at some level but my friend has a good point as the ""Reinforced void armour"" rule is actually separated from the Void armour save and states:  
  
""In addition to the benefits provided by void armour, the wearer of reinforced void armour must re-roll failed saves against Templates and Blast type weapons."" - Horus Heresy: Conquest
  
The wording on that, especially the use of ""must re-roll failed saves"" leaves it out in the open.  It could be that the the functionality of the reinforced void armour works in tandem with the wearers environment, helping to mitigate indirect explosions including a wall sending shrapnel at them etc.
  
It's something I'll discuss with my opponents before playing them though, obviously, and it wouldn't change the benefit of increased firepower within proximity of the ammo dump box which was the goal.",2016-02-09 20:58:56+00:00,cztwccf,2,t1_cztl0at,15151,Warhammer

84,"My camo scheme can be a bit difficult to get a handle on but here is an explanation for it that I wrote on another forum:
  
It breaks down into a fairly simple process that I discovered by accident on the first Valkyrie that I painted, color choice takes some work though and is not always obvious. You base the model in a dark but muted version of the underlying color then you use either Agrax Earthshade for brown/earth tones or Nuln Oil for darker shades.
  
The next step is determining the color for the brighter splotches and shading, which sounds easier (at least to me) than it actually is. Luckily the camo scheme is relatively forgiving in that they blend into close to the same color and it's almost impossible to visually tell the difference. My tanks in the army shot actually have 3 attempts at finding the right colors but they manage to look just about the same.
  
My final choice was a base of Skavenblight Dinge, Nuln Oil liberally over all Skavenblight panels, then dry brushing Celestra Grey in heavier splotches followed by a light dry brush that pulls the grey over the intervening Skavenblight Dinge. That's how I create the weathered look, using the wash to darken the underlying color so that the splotches can create more contrast but still maintaining the darker color even with the light Celestra Grey dry brush in between.
  
For the primary colors on the tank, my colors are as follows:
  
**Vehicle Camo Scheme**
  
Base: Skavenblight Dinge
  
Wash: Nuln Oil
  
Dry Brush: Celestra Gray
  
Dry Brush: Skavenblight Dinge (over darker areas if they became to light during the camo scheme process)

It looked fine on the smaller vehicles but once I got to the really large vehicles it started to look off when you've got tiny bright blue wires running around a mottled brown hull.

94,"/u/sicyo well thank you for pointing this out to me good sir!

&amp;nbsp;

That quote actually went right through the writers after I sent it to Rory and he mentioned it was really surprising that they didn't want to change anything since they usually request modifications be made.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to say I wrote it in one go and didn't revise it myself (the initial quote I did was for the chest when it was pretty much a different item, so I wanted to change the tone of the final quote) but I'm not sure if that's just my memory going in old age or not.

&amp;nbsp;
  
I'm glad you guys liked it and I must admit it's nice to see people still using my chest even now, regardless of it never being designed to be some massive power item.  Daresso is a fascinating character and I wanted to get into his head when I designed it; which is also why it ended up being AR/EV for anyone still debating that mystical question.  If Daresso's *shield* is AR/EV then it's reasonable to assume that his armor would follow suit.  No other reason for it, purely a fluff decision I still rock the chest to this day.  

&amp;nbsp;

As to the Dodge not aligning with the AR/EV, I did not design the dodge and it was effectively a bonus Christmas present from Rory that he put on the item as a nod toward the original item I built roughly a year prior to the final items completion.  (That's off the top of my head, I don't want to go dig through my emails to find the exact date!)  The final item I submitted did not even *have* Dodge so be thankful for free mods.  :)

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you again for the kind words!",2016-01-16 05:12:04+00:00,cz04exk,2,t1_cyzg6o7,39573,pathofexile

If you want to use the scheme, here is the bizarre ivory color I managed to coax out of the paint.

**Base:**  Rakarth Flesh
  
**Wash:**  Sepia
  
**Dry Brush:**  Ushbati Bone
  
**Dry Brush:**  Pallid Wytch Flesh (it will look *really* bad at this point but this step was imperative to get the panels to brighten up correctly)
  
**Dry Brush:**  Karak Stone
  
For whatever reason the Karak Stone smooths out the rough Pallid Wytch Flesh and also takes on a kind of glow from the white/brown undertones beneath it that make it more ivory than Ushbati Bone or Screaming Skull could ever hope to provide.  Plus it mattes the coloring so it isn't overly shiny as well.

96,"Thank you so much!  I can't wait to post the Stormhammer but magnetizing the six sponson weapons is taking a bit.  I should hopefully be able to get it painted and up here for you to check out soon though!

As to points wise, it's a bit difficult to say.  The 1905th, with the Stormhammer included, and the Arvus shuttle I am ordering at the end of the month will come in around 3,500 points loaded to bear.  That means auxiliary drives on the tanks etc. but with the Stormhammer rocking multilasers as opposed to sponson lascannons because quite frankly with the Malcador and Leman Russ Annihilators, I should have enough single target fire power.  
  
Where I'm lacking is the ability to stop a swarm of guys from overwhelming me if the Stormhammer gets cut off.  I think 8 multilasers and it's battle cannons should allows it to cut a swath through anything silly enough to breach the 36"" line.  Though they will all be magnetized so if I am wrong, I can easily adapt the tank as needed!

The secondary component in such a case would be House Ardeo and if I repaint my Imperial Knight Crusaders to House Ardeo Colors...like I'm pondering doing....that puts the Allied Detachment roughly at 1440 points.

So the total point value for the 1905th deployed with their allied Knights (Assuming a repaint of the Crusaders) comes out to roughly 4900 points.  Which isn't to bad considering I started the force in October!",2016-01-14 18:41:58+00:00,cyy74df,2,t1_cyxs797,27343,Warhammer

To much dirt/weathering being applied, while awesome in a diorama situation, is not really my cup of tea.  Yet I try to make the tanks still show their age and combat-worn outward appearance; this is one of the main reasons that every bit of steel on my models is based with Warlock Bronze, washed with Agrax Earthshade, and then dry brushed with Leadbelcher.

Thank you!  I'm still struggling on the table side of things as my brain has been struggling to get out of 2nd edition mode and it seems like there are always additional side rules that break from my understanding of the game.
  
For instance opening turn of a game against Tau, my Dracosan with Flare shields and 5 HP carrying 20 Veletaris was one shot destroyed by a Tau tank without there being a single thing I could do about it.

105,"Awesome, glad you liked them!  This army has been the most fun to paint, hands down, since I started painting again in April.  Hell, I don't think I've ever been this happy with a paint scheme as it just seems to adapt itself to any model I apply it to.  The bizarre thing is how the color of the paint scheme shifts under different lighting, they go from being shades of blue to shades of light grey/white.  Not sure what causes it, especially the deep blues that come out in low lighting but it's really a cool effect nonetheless.

Now the big question is do I pursue a super heavy tank (Stormhammer/Stormsword etc) or do I make the attempt to put in an allied contingent of Questoris Knights with an Atrapos and Styrix.  The Knight route sounds fun but I'm hesitant due to the sheer lump sum investments it will require.  Of course one does not exclude the other, if we enter into the realm of insane point values, it's just the purchase of two Questoris Knights to even put them on the table that is making me balk.",2015-12-25 04:53:32+00:00,cyapju1,2,t1_cyadlyf,27485,Warhammer

110,"I might try brightening it a bit but it's supposed to look liked dried blood and rust, which is why it has such a red leather look.  The neat thing about the cloak is it doesn't have an ounce of red paint on it!  I based it with Rhinox Hide, washed it Nuln Oil, dry brushed Doombull Brown onto it and then hit it with Bloodletter glaze until it got that dark red.  After that I went back with Nuln Oil and put it in the creases of the cape to make sure they provided that moving cloth look.  So to make a brighter red I can just add another layer of glaze to it and it should stand out more but as a whole the 1905th isn't exactly the bright color group.  
  
Their entire Cohort, the Ash Scorpions, died almost to a man on Port Maw and the remaining men who founded the Rust Scorpions only survived because they were grievously wounded and put on a commandeered supply ship for immediate medical evac.

113,"Thanks!  I really can't wait to get them on the table so I can do a battle report, though I'm pretty sure learning the army in practice and not in the book will take some getting used to.  I actually came up with a ""Scorpion Formation"" strategy that I'm pretty excited about using, assuming the table wants to play nice and line things up for me.  I still need a few more things to make it functional though (2 Dracosans, 1 Incinerator, 1 Annihilator).  I came up to it when I was posed the question how I was going to safely disembark from the Dracosans as they can only be exited Left/Right.  It was only after coming up with the entire strategy that I realized it looked like a scorpion, which just made things all the better.
  
Here is the strategy and keep in mind Dracosans are 13AV/5HP with even more additional add-ons to toughen them up and shrug off melta weapons.
  
[Click Here](http://i.imgur.com/agk90Mx.png)
  
Basically the Dracosans move up and form into a jagged line, overlapping their fields of fire (1 will have to be a twin-linked lascannon, 3 demolisher cannons).  Troops disembark and move into adjacent cover/buildings etc. to hold the flanks.  Meanwhile the Malcador Annihilator provides suppressing anti-armor fire from behind the Dracosans.  
  
Next turn the Dracosans pull forward and straighten up to create a wall of 13AV/5HP in front of all movement but they leave a gap in between them, which the 3 Leman Russ Incinerators sporting Volkite Demi Culverins and Lascannons roll through like the stinger on the end of the scorpions tail.  This same turn, assuming I roll in the reserve, 3 Leman Russ Annihilators with Outflank come in behind enemy heavy vehicles and begin hammering them on the weakest point of their armor.  All the while the Incinerators are thrashing squads and are supported by Veletaris fire from cover.

114,"I actually did that, I felt like the Red Scorpion decals would be interesting and was trying to think of a Lore way to hint at the descendants of the Rust Scorpions being made into that Chapter.  The only issue if their scorpion and the Ash Scorpions (905th) are pretty drastically different.  Most of the gear on the Rust Scorpions was designed to represent modified Ash Scorpion equipment, as they were entirely reliant on that supply ship for some time while they were in isolation, so changing the entire shape of the Scorpion doesn't sit well with me...despite it being incredibly convenient.  I also saw the Scorpion on the Freelancer Knight transfer sheet as well but it was once again different in design.

There is simply never enough CHOOM! and it would be nice to have a Knight to use.  
  
I will say this though, things are getting pretty expensive at this point and I don't know that I can justify a Knight over a Stormhammer (which, while not a Volkite equipped vehicle, would be a damn shame not to get as it is SA specific); I'm also aesthetically vain enough that I feel the need to buy a second Stormhammer just to ensure it is painted up in Rust Scorpion colors.

117,"Thank you for the compliment!  I try to let the fluff that I write drive the painting style while I'm initially coming up with it.  In this case the Rust Scorpions are actually the remnants of the Ash Scorpions who were wounded early on in the battle for Port Maw, which is described in the Forge World book HH: Conquest.  Their coloring is due to the fact their initial equipment was retrieved from the cargo ship they had been placed in, which was carrying replacement equipment for the 905th Ash Scorpions, and the ""Rust"" portion of their name was one of those barracks jokes that takes on a life of its own and eventually works its way into a units history.  In the case of the 1905th, one of the soldiers grimly joked that with all of the dried blood caked onto their armor they should be called the ""Rust Scorpions"" now...and it just stuck when they were reformed.
  
The background behind the 1905th is summed up in a communique that I've written, albeit I have not had a chance to revise a few spelling/grammar errors into the final format, but it's absolutely readable.

118,"Thank you!  I use the same technique from my 40k Air Cavalry army to do the camo pattern and unfortunately it does not seem to translate into written instructions.
  
It breaks down into a fairly simple process that I discovered by accident on the first Valkyrie that I painted, color choice takes some work though and is not always obvious.  You base the model in a dark but muted version of the underlying color then you use either Agrax Earthshade for brown/earth tones or Nuln Oil for darker shades.  
  
The next step is determining the color for the brighter splotches and shading, which sounds easier (at least to me) than it actually is.  Luckily the camo scheme is relatively forgiving in that they blend into close to the same color and it's almost impossible to visually tell the difference.  My tanks in the army shot actually have 3 attempts at finding the right colors but they manage to look just about the same.

My final choice was a base of Skavenblight Dinge, Nuln Oil liberally over all Skavenblight panels, then dry brushing Celestra Grey in heavier splotches followed by a light dry brush that pulls the grey over the intervening Skavenblight Dinge.  That's how I create the weathered look, using the wash to darken the underlying color so that the splotches can create more contrast but still maintaining the darker color even with the light Celestra Grey dry brush in between.
    
For my 40k Army, I used Dryad Bark as a base, Agrax Earthshade as the wash, and Gorthor Brown as the splotch/shading color.  I think I'm going to have to make a video of the technique eventually because it's really a bizarre/cool effect, since the wash causes the surface to grab the light dry brush and prevents it from becoming close to the shade of the splotches.
  
I will say this though, prepare to murder small dry brushes in the process.  It won't matter how clean you keep them either, you're going to kill 1-2 per large model or 2-3 smaller vehicles because the splotches require pressure that pushes paint into the ferrule due to the way you have to use the brush.  I think I'm on brush number 18 at this point and I really need to go buy some more from the store.  Hope that helps!

He has an ability, mentioned in another post above, to grant +1 BS to a nearby vehicle which can't be applied to Super Heavies...but Malcadors aren't Super Heavies for the Solar Auxilia, so I'm sure you can see where I'm going with that.  

&amp;nbsp;

On top of that he can also call in a monstrous orbital strike with unlimited range which can also draw line of sight from any squad with a Nuncio Vox in it...so he doesn't even have to draw line of sight himself.  Which is handy given his need to stand near the big angry Malcador tank, I don't even have to get him out in the open to drop the barrage on someone!  It's only a one time thing per game but it's certainly will not be shrugged off by your opponent.

I'm pretty excited about getting these guys on a table, I've been slowed up by the shipping speed from Forge World more than anything.  I'm a bit concerned that the third Dracosan, which I've been putting off, may be more necessary than I initially thought.  Yet even if I order it right now, which I can't unfortunately, it wouldn't be here until the first week of December most likely.  So I may have to run my current Dracosans with twin-linked lascannons instead of demolishers in order to have enough open seats to fit the assault force.

&amp;nbsp;

Once the second Incinerator is painted and the second Annihilator is done, I'm going to take a run at a game regardless.  The Malcador will get ordered sometime around Christmas is my guess and that will be followed by a Thunderbolt to provide anti-air support in the long run.

As they are already getting their BS buffed by the squadron skill, I will be giving the Malcador Annihilator the Strategos buff as it will nicely compliment the twin linked primary guns as well.

Of course if Forge World ever sees my photoshop dream of a Malcador chasis sporting a primary cannon consisting of four connected Volkite Demi Culverins for a Heavy (20)...""Unleash the Fury Mitch!""...explosion of CHOOM!, well I think we all know where the Strategos will be putting his buff then.

I always do extra things like the poster in the hope that people will get a kick out of them.  I've also complete two Imperial Communiques; one, which explains the entire background behind the Rust Scorpions, and a second one that hints at possible issues with Lord Marshal Marcalius Audacter potentially being influenced by an artifact (ala` Fulgrim, to a much lesser extent).  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
I honestly doubt I could even say how deep the influence runs until I write an after battle report from the Strategos' point of view; I usually sit around and bounce ideas about then just go with it when I'm writing.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
In fact...here:
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
Quick Background: The Ash Scorpions are the 905th Solar Auxilia Cohort designed and written into lore by Forge World.  They fought a brutal battle across a giant Death Star-like space station to destroy the Rebel/Horus aligned Adeptus Mechanicus overseers signal jammer that was blocking all Imperium Fleet communications.  Only one squad Prime was left standing at the very end, his name is still unknown, and he managed to plunge his sword into the signal jammer, killing himself and shorting out the device.
    
&amp;nbsp;
  
Which should have been the end of the Ash Scorpions extremely decorated history...except the early wounded had been loaded onto a re-supply ship for the Cohort to be evacuated for medical attention.  The rest is explained in Lord Marshal Marcalius Audacter's communique below!

I agree about the base, I actually ordered special bases for the Tactical Command squad but he simply has to much going on to fit on any of them; the typewriter specifically has a rather large footprint on the base and that prevented the model from being on one of the stone outcropping bases I had planned to use.

In relation to the 1905th Rust Scorpions, I've developed a force that relies on Volkite weaponry for almost 75% of its firepower.  I'd say that makes promoting the weapon being used on the recruitment poster entirely justified.

I just checked the size real quick as the listed Baneblade measurements didn't seem accurate.  I am assuming they aren't including the barrels on the back but when you're trying to transport the tank you have to keep those things in mind!
  
Anyways the measurements are as follows:
  
Length (Barrels to Front Track):  9.5"" 
  
Width (Sponson tip to Sponson tip): 7""
  
Height (Bottom of Tracks to the Top of the Center Gun Mount): 3.5""
  
I did not include the antenna in the height because that thing is just begging to be broken when transporting the tank and I wish I had not placed it on there to begin with.  Yet I did so I'll have to deal with it, I may end up cutting it down to make it more manageable though.

The two-hand power axes you see are replacements for the Volkite Chargers and there is no reason to be let down by that.  If you take the Power Axe squad as a Household Retinue for your Lord Marshal and attach him to them they become death on wheels  to those they encounter.  At WS5 with Preferred Enemy (Infantry), S4 AP2, Shroud Bombs, and the Lord Marshal's grav-wave, charging this unit becomes a seriously difficult effort for any opponent.  Which means they will almost always be the ones charging in first and the Paragon Blade carried by the Lord Marshal is capable of reaping destruction, while the Displacer Matrix provides him a relatively crazy amount of defense.  With a 3++ Invuln that moves him off the table into reserves on a 1, the LM can then deep strike back in...right on top of whichever Nuncio Vox equipped squad he wants.  The crazy bastard only goes down on the roll of a 2 and with the huge assortment of equipment at his disposal can be made into a nightmare for your opponent.

The anti-armor is handled by mass Lascannon volleys, utilizing the Malcador (Siege Armor/Flare Shield making it tanky as hell) and hull-mounted Lascannons on approach with the Incinerator Assault Squadron (who also receive +1 BS for firing on the same target) while the Annihilator Strike Squad outflanks behind the enemy and cuts into the rear armor with their Lascannons.  I'd prefer three Lascannon rolls when tank hunting than rely entirely on the Vanquisher, not to mention they can be re-tasked to hunt heavy infantry once enemy armor has been handled.  
  
Meanwhile the two, eventually three, Veletaris Storm Sections with Volkite Chargers will be loaded into fully equipped Dracosans with Demolisher Cannons/Multi-lasers.  The final squad will be the Household Retinue utilizing Power Axes with the Lord Marshal attached to them and (eventually, when the models come out) a Medicae unit.  Their Dracosan will have to use the Twin-linked Lascannon option due to needing more than 10 seats.  They will engage any assault based targets and the Lord Marshal will be equipped with a grav-wave generator on top of the shroud bombs which should let me get the initial charge in on the enemy.  They will be supported by mass Volkite fire from the Incinerators and Veletaris, basically wreaking havoc while the Dracosans provide heavy fire support via Demolisher/Multi-las and their insane 5 Hull Points.
  
As to the Valdor it has some scary rules involved with using it that make it feel a bit to vulnerable to me with some nasty backlash.  I may warm up to it once I have the initial projected force done but for right now I'm going to steer clear.

There was a guy telling some people who were passing by that I used an air brush to do it and he gave me the most incredulous look when I corrected him.  It was on my Marauder Destroyer and I'll be damned if I let it be misrepresented after the cost/building nightmare that thing inflicted on me!
  
I found out how to do it by complete accident when doing my first Valkyrie and initially thought I had screw up the wing so I thought to hell with it, keep plugging along until the mistake looks right...which it did!  I'm convinced it has something to do with the wash right on top of the base layer as the non-blotches dry brushing does is not grabbed up by the model without it being present.  The dry brush also needs to be two to three shades up from the base coat or enough of a stark difference that it doesn't blend in.  
  
I've tried the following combinations with solid results:
  
Skavenblight Dinge &gt; Nuln Oil &gt; Celestra

The end result should be the Malcador engaging armored targets with an array of lascannon goodness followed up by three Annihilators coming in behind the enemy armor and hitting their rear armor like a truck.  Demolisher Cannons on the Dracosans will soften the enemy infantry and the Household Retinue, with the Lord Marshall in tow, will engage assault units.  Meanwhile the Volkite wielding Veletaris will begin deflagarating the remaining infantry with the Incinerators providing the heavy knock down blow.
  
That's in a perfect world and probably won't happen but the Malcador can take an option that gives it 14AV on the front facing and that stacks with Flare Shielding which gives -2 str to template/blast weapons/-1 str to other shooting attacks on the forward arc.

150,"Wow.  That's probably the most technically accurate compliment I've ever received, I'm not even sure what to say in response to it!  
  
The dry brushing lines are a by product of the process I use to create the camo scheme, I accidentally stumbled onto it with my previous Guard army and if you pay close attention to the Dracosan (should you check it out once I post it) you'll notice that the dark color is a slightly different shade than the Incinerator.  It took me a bit to switch gears from browns to greys and I was experimenting with few different methods.

In the case of the Incinerator, I am basing it with Skavenblight Dinge and then saturating the same areas with Nuln Oil.  I wait for it to dry entirely and then, using a dry brush, I took Celestra Grey and created the splotches with a heavier press on the brush.  Once I have about 4-5 splotches that fit the shape of the model without looking to cartoony/plastic, I use the left over paint on the dry brush to cover the area between the splotches which weathers the bottom layer of paint and proves a lighter worn look.  It also causes the dry brush lines unfortunately and if I get to zealous trying to blend them I tend to lighten the area more than intended.  If you've got an idea for fixing that, I am absolutely all ears, because it drives me nuts too.
  
It can be difficult to balance the number and spacing of the splotches, depending on the model itself, and I'm glad the desired contrasting effect came through on the Incinerator.  I've been critiqued before that my tanks looked to pristine, which made your commentary about this one looking battle worn an absolute relief as the 30k environment almost demands that hard worn equipment feel.
  
Thank you again for the kind words and critique, I've only been painting again since April and it's been an uphill battle since the last time I really painted prior to that was in 2000.

151,"Here's what Horus Heresy: Conquest has to say about Volkite weapons:

""'Volkite' is an arcane Martian term for a variety of powerful ray weapons whose origins date back to the Age of Strife.  Possessed of considerable killing power surpassing most armaments of their size, volkites were difficult to manufacture, even for the most able of the Mechanicum forges, and the demands of the expanding Great Crusade swiftly overwhelmed supply of these relic guns.""
  
In function they are death ray weapons that any unsaved wounds into additional automatic hits on the targeted squad with a rule called Deflagarate.  Which is described as follows:
  
 ""Deflagarating attacks have a devastating effect on organic matter, explosively burning flesh into ash and jetting fire.""
  
These size of weaponry scales from a Volkite Serpenta (pistol sized) on the low end of the scale to the Volkite demi culverin...which is the the Incinerator's main cannon.  If you've seen Mars Attacks and watched the martians mow down groups of people with their ray guns...magnify the size of the ray to fit the Leman Russ and then put them in Assault packs of 3 tanks that gain +1 BS when firing on the same target.  I honestly cannot wait to unleash them in a game once I have two more!

That meant cutting off the hands from the arms that were intended to be holding the horizontal brace in order to allow the arm to socket into the hand on the gun for about 5 of the models.

Inquisitor Coteaz is in place for ""I've been expecting you"" and will be attached to the Multi-meltas or a Scion Command squad with the weapons shuffled to put 4 melta-guns into it.

It's a bit hard to see here, as the Stormlord is at an angle, but if you put them side by side you'll still see the spacing of the left track for both tanks is off in comparison with their right track.

The Marauder Destroyer is especially fragile and without forcing my girlfriend to hold it in her lap the whole way I doubt it would get there intact!

If you're curious, you can check out this battle report that I posted a couple of weeks ago.  I don't win but it was a brutal throw down battle, one turn saw over 60 dice rolls pouring into a squad of Space Wolf heroes after my Scions were able to deep-strike into perfect kill range.

168,"The thing with scratches to me is that none of my vehicles show battle damage so, suddenly banging up a single tank with battle damage would look bizarre.  If I had been doing that from the start I would agree but I've only been painting again since April of this year and before that I was done in 2001 when I joined the USAF.  I have some medical issues and despite being able to paint (time-wise) around 2007 my hands would shake uncontrollably whenever I tried to paint anything with detail.  

Earlier this year I noticed that my hands weren't shaking while typing anymore and grabbed an old banged up brush to see if I could tap small points on some of my old models.  When I realized that I could I was seriously excited and as the Skitarii had just come about, I got into them.  2,000 Points later I didn't want to see the color red again and grabbed a box of 5 Scions to clear my head and suddenly in 3 months time I'm looking at 4,000+ points of IG/MT/Elysians.  So to say I've been crash coursing my painting skills is an understatement.

Some of the more mechanical things I'm still not hugely comfortable with.  It was only recently that I started actually drilling barrels, which is why the heavy bolters on the front of the Stormlord and the stubbers in the back all have their barrels drilled.  So the idea of scratching up the tank as it stands, especially for the first time on a super heavy that costs a pretty penny, isn't hugely appealing to me.  I can say this though, I will take your recommendations and when I complete this Chimera that came with the Cadian Defence Force box...I will battle scar it and paint it up, adding charring around the armor deflected shots.  If anything it will give me some time to practice without leaving me feeling like I ruined a super heavy if I mess up.

169,"The power lines across the entire force have always been blue unless they were corrugated (which sometimes vary to metallic) or are tied to a Scion weapon system (which are a highlighted black).  

Raised armor panels are done in a shaded grey, while weapon based sights are predominantly based with Temple Guard Blue highlighted and sometimes highlighted with Baharroth Blue.

Lights are handled based on the system they are attached to.  If the light is protruding from the model it is based in temple guard blue but if it is recessed into the unit and/or hand held device it is gauss blaster green.  Forward facing lights that are not part a weapon sight system are gauss blaster green.  The only exception to this that I'm aware of off the top of my head can be found on the lascannon sights for my Valkyries which are Gauss Blaster Green due to the number of blue accent sights already in place.

The issue with trying to change something like this is we're talking about 4,000+ Combined Points of Astra Militarum (IG) and Militarum Tempestus.  This includes 3 Super Heavies (Marauder Destroyer, Hellhammer, and the Stormlord), 4 Valkyries, 1 Vulture, an Imperial Knight and then a combined 7 squads (Command squads included).  Support/specialized vehicles are also in there.  So changing one tank, especially a Super Heavy that draws eyes on the table, would make it look very out of place with the rest of the force.  It should be noted this force was never intended to become this large, I was only trying to put the Scion Air Cav formation on the board, but feedback here inclined me to continue building it up and I am consistent with my painting and color schemes.

I know that sounds like I'm just dismissing you but I can promise you that's not the case, I'm planning on building a Solar Auxilia army next and the feedback I've received from people will all influence how I decide to design them if I don't go with one of the pre-existing themes.

The extra sponsons really do give the Stormlord a more threatening feel, especially when you keep in mind that the army list strategy I've been putting together, with peoples input over at Bolter and Chainsword, has the Hellhammer running close escort for it.  The Guard force on-board will be static while the Scions will dismount and seize objectives.  The Stormlord will also be self repairing on a 2+ thanks to the 3 Servitors and hurling 2 multi-melta shots out as well.  Inquisitor Coteaz will ensure that Drop Pods won't get in close to the Stormlord and those that do will be peppered with Multi-Melta fire on their way down; this is the entire reason I painted the Inquisitor that I posted recently, it's all been building to this strategy.

Mind you I'm aware the strategy is goofy and silly but it just sounds like a lot of fun on the table so who am I to argue?

As Inquisitor Trelan Orvelus, which is who the model represents, is in charge of trying to clean up the nightmare of Leander VI it seemed obvious he would be utilizing paint that would match with the landscape on the planet.  I really wished there had been some chain or scale in the armor that would allow for me to change things up a bit but the sheer number of things on his belt does help some.

That being said, basic concept 2 Combined Detachments (Scion/Guard), 1 Inquisitorial Detachment.  You lock and load the Scions and Guardsmen with a mix of Plasma and Melta weaponry, as well as an Enginseer with 2 multimeltas and his servitors for repairing...then you pile them all in a 4 Sponson Stormlord with a Hellhammer on point.   

Inquisitor Coteaz ensures the drop pods will not come a dropping on your head as he will be attached to the multimeltas or a 4 melta Scion command squad (up in the air); ""I've been expecting you"" will allow him to alpha strike the pods with meltas.

That's pretty much it, I just came up with it and started being amused at the idea of just setting two super heavies on the table with my entire army off to the side.  As the Stormlord is open topped only in relation to embark/disembark, I can jump squads out to take objects as well while maneuvering the bulk of the super heavies into protection around singular objectives.  

I know there are tons of holes in the strategy but it will be fun and with 20 firing points those melta/plasmas will unleash fury on anything that comes close while 6 combined lascannons can reach out to hit long range targets.

**Vehicles**

Base: Dryad Bark

Wash: Agrax Earthshade

Dry Brush: Gorthor Brown

Camo Technique: When dry brushing gorthor brown push down on the small dry brush to get a more distinct blotch of the color then pull it about to create the camo pattern, once you have 3-4 blotches with some room in between them use the residual paint on the dry brush to fill in the entire area.

I can't particularly explain why but the Agrax Earthshade leaves the surface much more prone to grab paint when your dry brushing which is how the weathered/faded look for the camo pattern is created.

Wash:  Nuln Oil

Dry Brush:  Dawnstone

I just wish Militarum Tempestus could utilize it directly, I've had to totally prepare an AM detachment just to field some of my units.
  
  
I feel like the MD would have done a fantastic job of handling Tyranids/Orks etc. but against a wall of terminators and 14AV Landraiders it could use Hellstrikes to remove one but after that it was just firing auto-cannons and the tail assault cannon...both of which did not have the punch to really take them out (What happened to Assault Cannons?!  I swear they used to be as scary as Lascannons back in 2nd edition or perhaps my memory is going...)
  
  
I'm currently working on a concept Army List that could end disastrously or completely catch my opponent off-guard.  I had to order another model tonight to make it work but the end result should be relatively amusing even if it doesn't work!

197,"Yeah, I've played him twice and the first time I brought all my Valkyries which made an enormous difference.  The problem is just moving the damn things and having the Marauder Destroyer in the store for a painting tournament was difficult enough traveling with, let alone 4 Valkyries packed into weird boxes and braced with foam.

My actual Air Cav force usually has the MT Air Formation being backed by the Knight or AM.  I will admit it crossed my mind to proxy my Elysians as a Veteran squad and use the silly list I made that has 3 Lords of War in it for 2,000 points.  I was of the mind that just wouldn't be fun (Knight marching next to a Hellhammer with a Marauder Destroyer flying over head as scions deep strike behind the enemy forces) but if I hear that SW formation mentioned again you better believe the kid gloves are coming off!",2015-09-28 20:07:27+00:00,cvh9i1k,2,t1_cvh5l3g,5514,Warhammer
198,"Sure but keep in mind this was a fun game and I had built the list prior to knowing I would be fighting Space Wolves and specifically because I wanted to get my Marauder Destroyer into an actual game.  I have a Hellhammer and I knew going in that it was the better choice but I just had to let the Marauder go play!  Also, due to still having the AM portion of my army in the painting mode I didn't fill up all 2000 points.

He thought he was going to eat the commander and all of a sudden not only did the commander sucker punch him in the face with the power fist, killing him out right, I then rolled 6 consecutive 4's (all of them were 4's) absorbing enough wounds to keep the squad in the fight.  

At which point the guardsmen killed another terminator before the hammers fell.  That little company command squad was damn effective for it's point value!

200,"I actually had time to read up on it when I got home, as I was curious and this was only the third 7th edition game for me (last time I played was 2nd edition), and looking at the screenshots I am pretty sure he was following what you're saying.  I killed the Rune Priest in the first volley who was using Look Out Sir on Niall and when he went down he used Logan to look out sir Stormcaller as they were both characters.  Then he brought up a guy with a storm shield and put him in base to base with Logan creating a walking line with Stormcaller to one side and the storm shield guy on his other side.

Then what occurred was my plasma guns were being absorbed into the storm shield due to it's invuln so they didn't melt Logan and my hot shots were funneling into Niall where they were just a 2+ save.  On top of that he did have astounding luck was Feel No Pain, I believe he absorbed in excess of 10 wounds on the squad with it.  All of the wounds on Logan were essentially Look Out Sir failed and it was plasma then Feel No Pain failed or Look Out Sir failed and he rolled a one for his saving throw.

If you check out turn 3B it's easy to track the wounds because he's really religious about keeping the markers down and Logan gained a wound back right after that due to Life Leech stating it could restore excess wounds to a member of the squad.  Logan would have been dead to rights prior to assaulting the second Scion squad had he not received that restored wound, oddly enough the Scions were able to handle the rest of the heroes without issue but Logan kept swinging that axe and wiping the entire squad out.  

So while I don't think he was twisting the rules, I think things would have gone differently if I'd done what I strategically wanted to do and brought the Hellhammer in for the Str10 AP1 massive blast.  I just really wanted to see the Marauder Destroyer on the board!  Damn my vanity...",2015-09-28 15:33:10+00:00,cvgyb29,2,t1_cvgu0zu,7934,Warhammer
201,"You could try to use Ulthuan or Celstra Grey if Administratum Grey isn't working for you.  The key point is you have to put Nuln Oil on the base Eshin Grey prior to dry brushing Dawnstone onto it.  That's what darkens the Eshin Grey enough to make it show in the folds and creases of the pants.

If you're out to capture that guys exact look and not a more grey one, I'd recommend basing with Dawnstone and then going to Ulthuan Grey after a watered down Nuln Oil is applied to the Dawnstone.  If that still isn't working for you, you could try a grey with less blue in it like Mechanicus Standard Grey, watered down Nuln Oil, dry brush Dawnstone and then dry brush Ulthuan Grey lightly on the top of it.  Really make sure to let the Dawnstone dry as it tends to change shades and sometimes even fades out against the base with the Nuln Oil.  I've had to re-apply the Dawnstone dry brush on a few things to make it really visible.
 
For instance check out the Melta Scion on the left of my Command Squad:  [Click Here](http://i.imgur.com/1EOmtYi.png)
 
...then compare it with the standard hostile environment guard I just finished:  [Click Here](http://i.imgur.com/lijwr0f.png)

The army has grown so quickly that it's outgrown my ability to even transport it; Air Cavalry, while extremely cool, is a total pain to get into my local store in one piece.
 
As to the camo pattern, I'll copy/paste this from my reply above:

=====

**Camo Pattern**

Base: Dryad Bark

Wash: Agrax Earthshade

Dry Brush: Gorthor Brown

Camo Technique: When dry brushing gorthor brown push down on the small dry brush to get a more distinct blotch of the color then pull it about to create the camo pattern, once you have 3-4 blotches with some room in between them use the residual paint on the dry brush to fill in the entire area.

I can't particularly explain why but the Agrax Earthshade leaves the surface much more prone to grab paint when your dry brushing which is how the weathered/faded look for the camo pattern is created.

=====

I should also note that I have murdered, maimed, and crushed more dry brushes than should rightfully be possible due to that camo pattern so if you're reading the instructions thinking it will kill your brush...I assure you that you're absolutely correct.  I have an ever gathering graveyard of dry brushes that I plan to post with my next army shot which should have the army functional at all levels even if it is not completed.

You know, I've never even thought about doing that.

For example the Hellhammer I posted a couple weeks ago ate two entire dry brushes due to the large surface area requiring the pattern.

Luckily my Series 7 Winsor &amp; Newton brushes seem to be damn near impervious to breaking down, so I don't mind it as much.  I also paint from a lap tray and not on a desk so I'd have to temporarily move things to get a camera on it.

They took a picture of it there for the stores Facebook and the yellow is no where near as neon.

The paint seems to make the drill slip a bit and that is especially problematic with things like the bolt pistol as it has the hollow portion in the barrel.  I've masked it was paint right now and the meltagun is just a small hole so I can handle that with green stuff without any issues.

300,Yeah the size comparison between an Elysian and my Scions is pretty severe; your scouts are going to need more cardio! ,2015-07-10 19:04:27+00:00,csyw4tl,4,t1_csxwudm,75975,Warhammer

302,"It should be noted that all of this good feedback is now going to result in a full Scion force that I will be pushing through prior to the Elysian Drop Troops.  I'm painting Elysian's right now but I have updated my order to include another 2 boxes of scions (1 command squad/ x2 10 man squads) and a Taurox Prime (Primarily because I want to paint it).  

I'll most likely be trying the Air Cav setup for the Scions with 4 Valkyrie's and, if I can get a confirmation from FW about Vultures being allowed in MT armies, I'll be supplementing my team with them.  Lots of painting to come and I'll update as I can!

So thanks again for the kind words!",2015-07-08 20:43:02+00:00,cswmf94,2,t1_cswfv24,9332,Warhammer
303,"Thank you!  Lets see if I can make reproducing it a bit easier than guessing which magical brown/green GW pot I used.  

The basic overriding concept was to use color-centric panels with shifting tones across them in irregular patterns.  If you've seen A-TACS camo, I was trying for a more basic version as I don't think I've got the chops to paint A-TACS at 25mm!

**Brown Armor**

* Base: Dryad Bark
* Dry Brush 1: Gorthor Brown
* Dry Brush 2: Baneblade Brown
* Wash: Agrax Earthshade
* Dry Brush 3 (Heavy to Light pressure to avoid wiping out the darker points near the edges): Karak Stone

**Gray Uniform**

* Base: Abaddon Black (Potentially can be skipped depending on how smooth the black primer goes on)
* Dry Brush 1 (Moderate Pressure - the Black base should only darken the gray and not stand alone in the uniforms folds): Eshin Grey
* Dry Brush 2: Dawnstone
* Wash: Nuln Oil
* Dry Brush 3 (Light Pressure): Dawnstone

I've repeated the colors to avoid making the soldiers to bright as I could easily get an almost white highlight that would look awkward against the brown armor with too much on the final layer.

**Hot-Shot Las Rifle Carbine:**

* Base: Dryad Bark
* Wash (Light, Crevice Targeted Appliation): Nuln Wash
* Dry Brush (Streaky dry brush here, light pressure, to give it a more of a camo look): Gorthor Brown
* Dry Brush (Barrel/Carbine Square Accents): Karak Stone

**Hot-Shot Las Rifle Metallic Components**

* Base (Thinned): Leadbelcher
* Wash: Nuln Oil
*Dry Brush (Very Light): Runefang Steel

**Hot Shot Las Rifle Power/Charging Lines**

* Base: Abaddon Black
* Dry Brush: Dark Reaper
* Dry Brush (Light Pressure): Fenris Grey

**Helmet Eyes/Wrist Screens**

* Base: Sybarite Green
* Dry Brush (On the screens, avoid the outer square to give depth): Gauss Blaster Green

**Wrist Computer Buttons**

* Base (Single dot): Temple Guard Blue

**Shoulder Light &amp; Rifle Scope Lense**

* Base: Caledor Sky
* Light Paint/Dry Brush: Baharroth Blue

I think that covers it, only thing I'd note is that the encasement around the skull on the backpack is painted to match the brown armor/carapace look as well.  I think the rest should be pretty easy to pick up but feel free to let me know if you run into any issues.  

I actually just ordered two more scion boxes to complete a full squad and make a command squad, along with a matching Valkyrie so I'll post more as I finish them.  I'm also testing a squad of Elysian Drop Troops in the same pattern to see if I can create a force that can share vehicles while alternating fighting style.

Hope all of that helped!",2015-07-07 21:01:18+00:00,csvfhns,2,t1_csutg5k,40203,Warhammer

308,"Yeah, you aren't the first person to point that out.  It honestly never crossed my mind since I trimmed my last squad with the same color, albeit not as cleanly as this one, and there was no indication of it being Christmas-y.  I might try hitting them with serpentine was and dry brushing Ushbati onto them to give it a more bone looking color.

For right now it will do though, I spent way to much time on that squad! :)",2015-06-26 07:16:55+00:00,csj6pny,2,t1_csj4099,8156,Warhammer
309,"I was pretty happy with how it came out as well but the actual process was really easy.  They are based in Rhinox Hide and then lightly dry brushed in Skrag Brown.  The only thing you have to watch out for is putting to much pressure on the dry brush as it will eat up the darker sections of the leather.

310,"Thanks for the compliments!  I did a thick wash of Caledor Sky on my wash brush and just pulled it down the length of the Taser Goad.  I then let it dry and repeated the same steps but this time with Temple Guard Blue.  The Caledor Sky will look dark in the center but barely show up on the sides of the Goad but once the Temple Guard Blue, which is very neon, is applied on top of it the color really shows up nicely.  Once that was done, I did another light dry brush of Leadbelcher to make sure the line stayed in the center and did not stray.

I would recommend doing one side at a time and babysitting it just a bit until it begins to dry as the watered down paint will try to run outside of the center if it's just set back down vertically.  Hope that helps!",2015-06-25 23:11:21+00:00,csit6bt,2,t1_csisld8,1057,Warhammer
311,"Gorgeous paint job!  I haven't been in direct contact with a Bloodthirster since it was an enormous heavy multi-piece chunk of pewter; seeing one so delicately balanced above the ground plays tricks with my head.

My guess is the new model is much more forgiving when someone gets angry and throws it in the other players general direction.  Damn thing wanted my blood, game or not.",2015-06-22 08:58:09+00:00,cselnfd,1,t3_3annbb,31762,Warhammer40k
312,"Heed these words!  I made the mistake of going at him with Celes/Cloud (covering my elements with spellblades), Drk Cecil, Wakka, and Vanille (Heal/Comet).

With all the missed hits, I couldn't be sure if I was actually close to beating the bastard or not but I mithril'ed once after the first fight;  I was able to bring him down with only Wakka and Celes still standing.  First time that I've felt like my available team was really struggling, as I usually mow through things using just Celes for elemental vulnerability and Celes/Cloud when multiple elements are needed.  

Time to level up some mages apparently!",2015-06-21 23:03:21+00:00,cse7xdg,2,t1_cse28e3,11526,FFRecordKeeper
313,"I feel your pain entirely, I've run into the zero 5* result after getting the $84.99 pouch and it's frustrating as hell.  I don't know about you but unless I 7* a character specific item for a character I love, it doesn't feel like they are complete and that just makes the bad rolls all the more heartbreaking.

Bravo to you for the video, glad to see the community isn't flaming you for showing how much this game can cost if you play it P2P.",2015-06-18 19:30:43+00:00,csb1sno,1,t3_3aabaf,19648,FFRecordKeeper
