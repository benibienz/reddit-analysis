67,"give me some more info about yourself this is what ESEA is for me:

i have 3k+ hours and i love to play cheaterfree games with my RL friends and with a league team. 

ESEA provides the option to play with up to 4 friends and i would say you can also solo Q the people on ESEA are mostly positive (you get black sheeps everywhere....) but for the most part you get nice guys and if you stay positive the others will too

to say if it fits you is hard 

if you only have 300 hours or so and you didnt reach at least LE in MM i think you  should not play ESEA there are alot of guys who expect you to be good and if you are not you will get hate ... hell even i flamed a guy once because he was 3-18 and i had insane stats (40+ kills) and we lost because he had 20 hours of CSGO and thought it would be a good idea to play ESEA.

if you dont have alot of friends who play the game ESEA is a nice Pug service to find players of your country because you will mostly play against or with people from your country/area.
im from austria and nearly every game there is a austrian person either in my team or the enemy team. 

i also found my team on ESEA.

TLTR if you think your can handle it you can buy it for one month and check it out solo Q or not doesnt matter the people are nice and you will make new friends! my feedback from 6+ months of esea: i love it and i will never go back to MM or Face(cheating for the FPL)it.
