I have a weird story and i wanted to know if someone would agree on what i did so please tell me

So a view days ago a mate of mine told me he really enjoys playing Call of duty infinite warfare so i thought to myself maybe i should also buy it just to give it a try.

*  little backstory on my part for a second 
i play alot of games but my main games are CS:GO(4000hours)
GTA(~500hours) and Planetside 2(~500hours) so im mostly play shooters and i know what a ""good"" shooter should be like.
the last COD i played was MW1 or COD4 and it was on my laptop waaay back in school... 
i have to say i enjoyed it alot so i thought lets try the new COD and if i dont like the IW part i can still play MW1 and the story of IW since it looks pretty nice.


Well the thing is i bought it downloaded 50 GB and started playing.

not for long though

i have a 144hz monitor and i really want games to run on 144 fps 
well cod has a FPS cap of 90 fps ...
now here comes the average guy and says: man thats a first world problem and you shouldnt complain about it ..."" 

okay okay i dont care 90fps max even if there is a 144hz setting in the menus so they acually had 144hz planed to be playable ...
(my rig has a GTX1080 so i could run the game on 144fps for sure since i only play 1920x1080 and not 4k) 


Okay first world problems i thought and next of i started playing in deathmatch ... 

the gameplay was fun and all but i had some problems with my mouse so i thought lets turn of mouse acceleration and lower the sense a bit.

Well NO !!! 

COD wont let you turn of mouseacceleration ...

 and for everyone that knows why it is important for a shooter to have a permanent sensitivity knows why this is  such a big problem the big word here is consistancy 

so i thought to myself well what now ?

maybe try to get used to it ? 

Okay ... so i played on and i saw the next problem ...

the mouse movement is synced with the FPS rate so everytime you get a fps dip your aim/movement is all over the place 
  

after i realised that i tried to stay calm but i couldnt ...

i payed 80€ (in persective CS:GO GTA AND Planetside 3 games i played for 5000 hours + are only around 75€ in total ) and this game is called a triple A titel but its such a piece of trash that i quit playing in only around 1 hour into the day i bought it ? 


went on steam support and refunded it the next day (today) 


does anyone agree with what i did or should i have seen this coming ? 


 **tl;dr : you have to read or you dont understand ... i had to refund cod because it sucks imho and i want to know if anyone would have done the same...**",gaming,The day i bought COD ...,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5c1lru/the_day_i_bought_cod/

I dont know if this works for everyone but i thought about it today so maybe you want to investigate on it.

so everytime i open up the menu in cs while on a server my fps drop to 80 and my friends say it looks like i lagg if i am running while pressing escape.
 
after i played around with this weird phenomenon i thought about exploiting it.

so maybe you can write a script with the console comands to:

jump

open menu 

close menu 

and with this you may be able to cross dust2 doors without getting wallbanged because it looks like you lagg for example

i was watching videos of it 3 days now and today it was 33% so i thought why not give it a try but....
i have a very hard time learning i mean i played 6 hours today and i dont know how to find the pirates i had to kill...

dont get me wrong im a fast learner but its hard to get in a game genre i have never played (but i love it)


so if you know abit about the game and you have some spare time (because my holidays just started and i am going to play every day now ) add me on steam(Auerc0re (steamlevel 21)) and i send you a teamspeak ip so maybe i can learn some stuff from someone.

 i hope my english is not to bad.

 i speak german and english. 

ps: if you have steamlevel 1 please comment on my profile or otherwise i cant tell if you are a bot or a real human ... #steamproblems",EliteDangerous,Hello Reddit i need some help and some pilots,http://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3csv6v/hello_reddit_i_need_some_help_and_some_pilots/
