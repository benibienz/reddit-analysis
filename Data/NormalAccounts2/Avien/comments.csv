5,"Easy fix; this recipe was posted 3 years ago. I learned that all you do is simply roll out the dough, like you would a pizza. Then cut the dough in half widthwise. Spread the ingredients out on the dough like you would a pizza, but **roll** the pizza up.

Slice through the roll about 6-8 time to create mini Buffalo chicken pinwheels. Place on a greased up baking sheet and bake until the middles are tender.

Garnish with blue cheese and scallions.

Here's a [link](http://blog.hostthetoast.com/buffalo-chicken-pull-apart-bread/) to the original Buffalo Chicken Bread, adapted from a recipe on Pinterest.

Note: I highly recommend his method of creating the Buffalo chicken beforehand in a crock pot.

24,"I always like hearing about my little state of Rhode Island.

The data said we have the 2nd lowest rate of returned rings. The author won't assume why, but I will assume it's not because 'love rings true' more so in our state than in the others.

I theorized that it's because of our huge Catholic population. ~55% of Rhode Islanders are religious, and 45% of that is made up of Catholics (compared to a 20% Catholic average in the US as a whole).

Catholics according to various sources of data appear to have one of the lowest divorce rates in the country (28%).

Although if it's not because of the Catholics, our 'low rate of ring returns' might be due to bureaucracy. According to a number of other sources, Rhode Island is one of the worst states to get divorced in with a minimum processing time of 540 days!

56,"On the Barrow-Wight:

&gt;Fleeing the Black Riders, Frodo and his fellow Hobbits were ensnared by a wight in one of the numerous barrows. The four were separated from one another in a dense fog, and, all captured, ended up in the same barrow. Three of the Hobbits seemed under a spell, but Frodo, almost succumbing to the wight, was able to call out to Tom Bombadil. Tom, hearing his song, came with haste to the barrow and dispelled the evil spirit from the tomb. Tom Bombadil, whose house dwells in the Old Forest near to the Barrow-downs, had told them earlier to pass by barrows on the western side; the hobbits stopped for lunch on what must have been a barrow, and promptly fell asleep in the shade on the east side. After their rescue, the hobbits each took from the spoils of the tomb a finely crafted Dúnedain knife, and continued their journey towards Bree.

On the Barrow Treasure:
&gt;The Barrow-blades were found in the barrow of a Barrow-wight on the Barrow-downs and given to the hobbits by Tom Bombadil, who told them that the blades were forged long ago by Men of Westernesse, foes of the Dark Lord who were overcome by the evil king of Carn Dûm in the Land of Angmar.

On Merry's Blade:
&gt;Merry's Barrow-blade played a major role in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. It was enchanted with the power to harm the Witch-king of Angmar himself by a weaponsmith of Arthedain long before. When he stabbed the Witch-king in the knee with it, it distracted the Nazgûl and broke the spell binding his undead flesh to his will, allowing Eowyn to kill him by driving her sword into his unseen head, thus fulfilling the prophesy of Glorfindel that ""not by the hand of man shall he fall.""

I always found the program content to be pretty darn interesting, but that's coming from a straight-edge, white kid who grew up in suburbia. For two years I studied all the different theories on why people commit crime, studied crime stats, and how crime is perceived by the MSM.

I'm sure Clinton-Dix would learn a thing or two and have some fun doing it.

This would later become known as the infamous ""tuck rule"" or ""Tom Brady rule"".

Then in 2008 Patriots QB Tom Brady was sent to IR after tearing an ACL&amp;MCL to a ""below the knees tackle"" by Chief's Safety Bernard Pollard. Later in 2009 during the offseason the NFL outlawed ""below the knees tackles against QBs. 

This was known as the ""Tom Brady rule"".

Later in 2015, QB Tom Brady was found guilty by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell of ""Conduct Detrimental to the League"" for his alleged role in deflating gameballs. Many questioned the lack of evidence against Brady and accused the NFL of railroading the QB as a means to flex its power over players. With the power of judge, jury and executioner,  many players now question Goodell's role in punishing players. 

Steelers RB DeAngelo Williams would go on to say that, ""Whenever the NFL brings forth an investigation into alleged player misconduct, they will most likely seek a penalty that had no basis in logic or reality.""

He would go on to call this type of punishment the ""Tom Brady rule"".

**TLDR:** Tom Brady has three rules named after him, the Tom Brady rule, the Tom Brady rule, and the Tom Brady rule.

*A User's Guide to Not Getting Screwed Trying to Register Their Out-Of-State Vehicle in RI*

---

**Obtaining a RI Driver's License**

It would definitely make your life easier once you move to RI, to transfer to an RI State License. You're also required to register with the RI DMV within 30 days of moving here and establishing residency.

To establish residency (for a DL) you'll need to prove you live here which means a utility bill or recent pay stub delivered to your new RI address. You'll also need your actual Social Security Card (not a copy). And finally you'll need to forfeit your Virgina license. Don't worry if your current residence is only temporary or a rental, it's the RI address that matters. 

* **Pro Tip:** Make a photocpy of your old license. It's good info to have in case you need to get proof from your old State that you paid sales tax on the vehicle in that state.

Once provided, they'll give you a temporary license (paper license) that will allow you to drive immediately while you wait two weeks for your laminate license.

You'll also need to fill out this form: http://www.dmv.ri.gov/documents/forms/license/LI-1.pdf

The 3rd page just reiterates exactly what I told you you'll need to have when you go to a DMV.

---

**Registering your vehicle in RI**

...IS A PAIN IN THE ASS!

Fill out this form: http://www.dmv.ri.gov/documents/forms/registration/TR-1.pdf

* Look at 'Out of State Transfers' on Page 3 for a list of info you'll need.

I guess the first thing you should do is get RI insurance. This should be easy enough, just tell your current insurer that you've moved to RI and they'll convert your policy and allow you to print out a paper card with your new RI policy.

Next is to purchase the vehicle and speak with your MA dealer (since you're purchasing the vehicle there). It probably won't be the first time someone has purchased a vehicle in MA, only to immediately register and title it in RI. I recommend you talk to them in detail about this move 1000 times over. 

What's important is that you will need to convert whatever title they give you to RI within 30 days of moving here.

The other most important thing is to have proof from the dealer that you paid at least 7% sales tax on the vehicle. RI wants to make sure that you didn't try to skirt sales tax by purchasing an out-of-state vehicle at a lesser tax percentage. If you do end up paying less (let's say 6%) RI will charge you the difference before they will give you RI plates.

* This info is important for filling out your required Sales or Use Exemption Form and Sales Tax Exemption Affidavit, shown here: http://www.dmv.ri.gov/registrations/transfer/index.php

For the VIN check, on vehicles 2001 or newer you'll need to go to your **LOCAL** police department and have them perform the check. Which means that whatever RI town/city you move to (have an address in) will be the one you need to check with.

The VIN check is relatively painless. You'll need to go to the PD in person, **with the vehicle** to be registered, with the current title (or copy of title if there's a lien on it) and tell the desk clerk that you're here for a VIN check. The fee will be something like $10-11. Bring a check book, I don't think they'll take card or cash.

* To get the vehicle to the Local Police Department (i.e. Assuming you don't already have Out-Of-State Plates and will need Temporary Plates):

&gt; To obtain a 5 day temporary plate to bring your vehicle to the police department for a VIN check you would need to bring your bill of sales, title, and proof of insurance, to any RI DMV office, and a temporary plate will be issued, the fee is $11.50.

So you eventually get your vehicle to the local PD and pay the clerk $10. Eventually they'll send an officer outside to meet you. You'll hand the officer your keys and the title. He'll fill out his form, jot down the mileage and VIN, go back into the station (run the VIN against a theft database), print out your form to confirm the vehicle isn't stolen, notarize it, then hand you back your title, keys, and the form.

* **Note:** Your VIN Check won't expire

---

**Going back to the DMV**

I recommend two trips to the RI DMV. The First to get your License, the Second to Register your vehicle.

On the Second trip you should have: 

* TR-1 Form

* Bill of Sale (from your dealer)

* Proof you paid 7% or higher sales tax on the vehicle (Otherwise RI will charge you the difference)

* RI License

* RI Insurance Card

* Title of the Vehicle (or a copy if there's a lien)

* Sales or Use Exemption Form (You purchased the vehicle outside of RI)

* Sales Tax Exemption Affidavit (You didn't purchase the vehicle to skirt 7% sales tax, here's my Bill of Sale and Proof I paid &gt;= 7% sales tax on the vehicle)

* Proof of VIN Check

---

**Getting your Plates and RI Inspection**

* RI will charge you a fee for your plates and registration expect to pay something around $100+

* They'll give you registration tags that you'll need to place on your plates

* Once they hand you your plates you have 5 days to get an RI State Inspection performed on your vehicle (~$50)

* **Note:** New vehicles are exempt from inspection for 2 years from the date of purchase or until the vehicle accumulates 24,000 miles, whichever occurs first.

* Inspectors will place a tag on your windshield if your vehicle passes (lower passenger side corner)

---

Congrats, you're finally ready to drive in RI!

I'm arguing that our tickets prices then, even when adjusted for inflation were 25-50% of what they are now and attendance wasn't 100% like it is now.

So if the data did exist for 1995-1999 we would have a heavier weight against us in this ranking.

**Edit:** Apparently we've been sold out since 1994. I don't think this kills my argument completely, but perhaps the Patriots bias isn't as large as I originally envisioned.",2016-07-12 16:22:57+00:00,d59cq33,4.0,t1_d59bn8d,1348.0,nfl
213,"I think he knows that his model isn't all encompassing. No models are, really. He probably knows this is a controversial subject and uses quotations as a way to show he's well aware, or oft-reminded of what being the ""best"" truly entails, or what his model doesn't account for.

That being said, I think Patriots have an inherit bias, through no fault of the author, given that he is using the past 15 years of social media and merch/ticket sales data to model his standings on.

In essence, the team didn't get good until 2001, and the team has been consistently good over the last 15 years (his entire data set). Naturally our base has been equally as good for those 15 years (everyone loves a winner). If we had our pre-2000 ticket sales included, even just reaching into 1995, then I think we wouldn't look as strong in the rankings.

224,"The only limit that really needs clarification is the NFL Commissioner's ability to act as arbitrator.

A fair or neutral arbitrator would in essence look at the evidence, look at the Commissioner's suggested punishment, look at the CBA-agreed-upon punishment, and the history of punishments for similar past infractions, and either deem the Commissioner's punishment too harsh, fair, or not harsh enough.

For example, regardless of whether you think Tom Brady was guilty of deflating footballs. Equipment violations like that only carry a $5,787 fine for the first offense. Also, according to Judge Berman and the rule of the CBA, Brady and the Patriots should have got a warning even before that fine. But as Commissioner and Arbitrator, Goodell either didn't consider, care, or know this and deemed his punishment of docking draft picks, a $1mm fine and a 4 game suspension for Brady, fair.

I would like to see arbitration powers removed from the Commissioner and given to a panel, or really just anyone that's not the person giving out the punishment.

I would prefer the arbitration panel to be out-house to remove conflict of interest between the NFL and its players, but even if it had to be in-house that still seems way more fair than giving those powers to the man making up the punishment.

SK stands for Skew. 

There's + or - Skew which indicates the rising or lowering status of the player's ADP.

For instance, if a player's ADP is 3.6 with a '+' in the SK column then some experts are warming up to the player and his average ADP is lowering. Remember, low ADP is a good thing because that means they should be drafted sooner (e.g. 3.4 &gt; 3.6).

In other words, if you see a '+' in the SK column some experts really like the guy for some reason or another, dragging his ADP lower than maybe everyone else things it should be at.

Conversely, '-' implies the opposite, that some experts think that player is overvalued and therefore his ADP is being risen higher than the other experts think it should be at.

334,"OK, kiddo.

Fantasy football is a game that daddy likes to play. Daddy isn't very good at the game, so daddy uses a cheat sheet to help him win called 'BeerSheets' 

Daddy plays this game with all of his friends. Daddy's friends think that they'll go balls deep in daddy. But with BeerSheets, Daddy will go balls deep in them!

So, Daddy needs to pick the best football players to be on his team. But the problem is that Daddy's friends also want to pick the best players. So we take turns picking who we think is best.

During the first round of picking, Daddy will wait patiently while his friends (i.e. 'fritadas') pick their guy, which he will cross off of his BeerSheet.

When it comes time for Daddy's turn, he will look at who has been picked, who is left, and look at their information on the BeerSheet.

The most important things are called 'ADP', 'Value', and 'PS'.

ADP stands for 'Average Draft Pick' this is when all the ""experts"" think that a player should be drafted. So when Daddy sees a number like 1.4, that means the player is really good. He should be picked by the 4th turn in Round 1.

The next thing is Value. The ""experts"" will rank all the players on a scale of 1-10. BeerSheets takes the average relative to a baseline (i.e. 'magic') and this tells Daddy how good a player is.

The last thing is 'PS' or 'Positional Scarcity'. This tells Daddy how much talent is left at a position once all the people Valued above that player get drafted. So if a player is listed at 74% with no one else above him, and the next guy is at 53% that means he alone is worth 21% of the total networth of players at his position! That player is really good compared to all the other players left at his position.

Daddy finally picks his player, eventually picks a full team,  thanks the Beer Gods, and then Daddy drinks his adult juice until he pisses himself and passes out.

Why? Because he picked the winning team this year and gets to insult all of his friends!

341,"As a Day 1 FFRK player who likes what you said about FFBE, I think I can provide a little insight.

&gt; FFBE plays much like a traditional RPG with quests, NPCs and an overworld map. 

This is probably my favorite aspect about FFBE. FFRK by comparison puts the entire game into a multi-stage dungeon battle. There's no crafting, no free-roam, no questing, no NPCs. In other words, it doesn't feel like an RPG but for the exception of the grinding, which gets old, fast.

&gt;The ""gacha"" system is character based, meaning that you might not always get the characters you want. To my understanding, FFRK's gacha is weapon-based, meaning that you can play with all characters - for nostalgia, or whatever.

This is correct. It should also be stated that the power-creep in FFRK is overwhelming. It's geting fairly hard to beat the toughest content without having 5* Weapons/Relics that give your entire party Haste, AOE Heals, AOE Attack/Magic Buffs. Pulling 5* relics is usually at a 10-12% rate and even then you probably won't get the one you want since there are many other 5* options in the pool as well.

&gt; FFBE's battle system is turn based with units able to use magic/abilities/limit breaks like in FF. It also has a main plot/story, and progression is fairly simple. Challenges come in the form of more difficult ""far plane"" or ""vortex"" bosses, but for the most part, the main story is easy to clear.

I love the turn-based element to FFBE. I like to think strategically and plan my moves out. FFRK is active battle so any seconds in hesitation may cost you a turn's worth of damage.

&gt; Aesthetically, I think this game is the best mobile one I've played. The music, sprites, and background are all phenomenal and fit perfectly. The game feels ""whole"" as a package, while FFRK feels more like nostalgic visits into the older FF titles. I basically quit every other mobile game I'd been playing when this dropped and don't regret it.

I'm with you there. I love the direction of the game and how beautiful it is.

FFRK has the nostalgia element down, especially with the music, but FFBE feels like its own game and that's more valuable and future-proof than FFRK.

359,"&gt; So, to recap: the DNC has told the media that super-delegates can’t and don’t get tallied for purposes of declaring a nominee until July; Sanders has taken the same view; yet the DNC has since April, we now learn, been working with the Clinton camp behind the scenes to have the Democratic primary declared over on June 7th.

&gt;And we have every expectation that the media — despite [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5PKoEbdDgA) — will comply.

&gt;So, to recap: **Clinton approached hundreds and hundreds of super-delegates in 2015, before any American had voted or any candidate taken a popular-vote or pledged-delegate lead, and asked for their endorsement on the basis of super-delegates being tasked with supporting the Party’s strongest candidate**; Sanders has accepted that view of super-delegates’ role; **Clinton, now leading by a large margin among super-delegates and pledged delegates alike, has suddenly changed her view to the “principled” position that super-delegates must support whoever wins the popular vote and the pledged-delegate count**; the media has treated Clinton’s about-face as honorable and Sanders’ consistent position as a betrayal of his core principles.

&gt;So, to recap: **the traditional mechanism for assessing which primary candidate has the best chance to win in the fall** is general-election polling, which [research tells us](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/31/11336884/donald-trump-polls-winning) **hits an “accuracy spike” in April**, at which point it’s about as accurate as August polling; Bernie Sanders led Trump by more nationally and in every battleground state in April polling; **the media and the Clinton campaign spent April talking about how general-election polling has no value**; now that Clinton seems almost certain to be the Democratic nominee, **both the media and the Clinton camp have suddenly declared spring polling inviolably predictive and reliable.**

&gt;So, to recap: the media has consistently reported on Hillary Clinton’s efforts to reach out to Sanders voters; the media is unable to provide any example of this happening other than Clinton gamely refusing to call for her opponent’s concession a month earlier than she conceded in 2008; Clinton’s camp in fact said it planned to [“disqualify” Sanders](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/06/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democrats-unity/) from the presidency, that his campaign was [“destructive”](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/after-new-york-win-clinton-campaign-says-bernie-sanders-attacks-help-republicans), that he could go [“fuck himself”](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/glenn-thrush-clinton-aide-fck-bernie), and that its most likely VP nominee was a moderate with no ties to the progressive movement whatsoever.

I don't agree with the author's title, but according to him it does indeed sound like Clinton and the media have flip-flopped viewpoints once Clinton solidified her lead in PDs.",2016-05-10 14:11:01+00:00,d2zx6lc,1.0,t3_4ioiez,14947.0,politics

377,"The baby boomers faced more adversity though. They grew up with the cold war, Vietnam war, Korean war, the war on drugs, at a time when the Internet wasn't even a thing.

A time when you relied nightly on the news not saying the Russians launched a nuke at the U.S. and the spread of Communism was going to kill our Capitalist way of life.

The Millenials have faced very little adversity comparatively. The War on Terrorism is an endless war so everyone is desensitized to it. Crime rates are at a historical low. Gas is cheap, food is plentiful. 

We grew up with the Internet and are in the age of information. So we're resilient to shock and fear tactics. We can still live off of our Baby Boomer parents, to shield us from the harsh economic realities their generation is putting us in.

The point being is that Millenials don't face much adversity. It's being reinforced by helicopter parenting which tell us were individual, we're unique, we're special and that they'll sue to prove it.

The problem is that human beings learn from adversity. So we can't grow as people unless we're challenged both physically and mentally. Our parents fighting that battle for us is self defeating.

Whether we are aware if this or not I believe that we make our own adversity. We put the answer before the problem. I think a lot of the trouble you see with the social justice movement is a byproduct of a feeling that your life isn't challenging, but someone elses is. So you fight a battle for them. 

Or perhaps sub-consciously you trick yourself into feeling like your life is challenging. The stuff that you don't like about yourself becomes your adversity. But instead of doing something about it you allow yourself to be reinforced with opinions from parents or the Internet. You displace these feelings and shift them onto society.

So now it's the world's fault that you're fat, it's the world's fault that you can't get a job, etc.

Goodell is employed and obedient solely to the owners of the NFL teams.

His record and actions are in line with whatever alliance of owners is currently keeping him as Commissioner.

That being said this whole notion of him overstepping his bounds is actually really just him using authority that the NFL Players Association either knowingly or unknowingly agreed to give him: Arbitration powers over the Player's appeal.

Goodell can make up a punishment, then force the player who appeals it to sit  there and make his case to Goodell, then Goodell can say, nope my punishment is fair and that's the end of it.

In other words Goodell gets to be judge, jury and executioner.

The problem is that the NFLPA didn't agree to him being the jury in this metaphor.

Goodell recently found out that the Players' contract didn't explicitly deny him from being the Arbiter in certain cases. So he's taking advantage of the opportunity, with approval of the NFL owners, to consolidate his power.

381,"Taken from /u/Jamesenglish in the /r/nfl thread:

&gt;For anyone wondering/hoping/guessing: no, this will not go to the Supreme Court. The case is too fact-bound and really involves a pretty straightforward application of existing law. It's true that the district court and circuit court disagreed on how that law mapped onto the facts of this particular case, but there's really no legal ""hook"" that would put this on the Supreme Court's radar. Second Circuit ruling will stand, though I do anticipate Brady's team will file for rehearing en banc and for cert. That's pretty much pro forma.

&gt;Edit: Sorry for the legalese at the end there. Brady's lawyers will first file for rehearing ""en banc"" in the Second Circuit. This case was decided by a panel of three judges, but the Second Circuit is actually composed of 13 active status judges. Brady's team will essentially be asking the entire court to rehear the case. Because the dissenting judge in this opinion is Chief Judge of the Second Circuit, I suppose there is some chance for rehearing.

&gt;If that doesn't work, Brady's team will file a petition for ""cert"" to the Supreme Court. That essentially means they'll be asking the Supreme Court to overturn the decision of the Second Circuit on legal grounds. That won't happen, for the reasons stated above. None of the judges in this case disagreed on the legal standard that should be applied, only the application of that standard to the facts of this case. The Supreme Court doesn't hear fact-bound appeals like this one unless they're of some other legal significance.

&gt;The actual decision here is a reversal and remand. There's really no reason non-lawyers should be concerned about that language -- it just means the case will go back down to the district court and Judge Berman will be forced to rule in favor of the league. He won't have any opportunity to skirt the Second Circuit's ruling.

Because of his monster 2013 season, his subsequent suspension and the numerous reports of being reinstated by the league, many fantasy football players were eager to snatch Gordon up before anyone else in the league could have the chance. 

But to do it might cost you someone on your bench, so there's a concern.

These reports were also coming out midway through the 2015 season when injuries are getting racked up and FF owners are grasping for someone to save their season.

Eventually though people started to realize that the NFL wasn't ever going to let him play football again. So it became less about when to pick up Gordon and more about parodying the hype surrounding him.

This happens to some NFL players on occasion. Andre Ellington got nick-named Red Jesus in 2014 after a lot of RB1s got injured and /r/ff was looking for a savior. The hype was palpable.",2016-04-12 16:37:32+00:00,d1zz7pz,6.0,t1_d1zy9at,1246.0,nfl

Strategy:

* Don't use any attacks that do damage until Ormi is defeated. His Draw Fire will eat your Retaliate strikes and you need those to hit Leblanc for unmitigated damage.

* Because you can't do any damage besides Retaliate Counters, it's a 33% chance that your first counter attack hits Leblanc. This needs to happen or I guess you can Blind Ormi to cancel Draw Fire

* Round 1: Blind Logos, Slow Leblanc, Advance Auron, cast Shellga

* Round 2: Haste party, Retaliate, Dispel Leblanc, start double hitting Auron, heal where necessary

* Round 3: Slow Ormi, Taunt with Auron and continue bursting down Leblanc

* Once she's dead focus Logos for the medals

* I went on Ormi cause Auron hit him first

* Refresh Advance when Ormi hits 75% HP if you focused him 2nd or 25% on Logos, same deal",2016-04-04 02:40:17+00:00,d1ov7fv,1.0,t3_4cxm6j,198103.0,FFRecordKeeper

* Retaliate with Cloud, Blind Thunder Gigas (Medal Req) Blizz Fire Gigas, Shellga with Y'shtola

* Burst down Fire Gigas first then focus on Ice Gigas. Have Vivi switch to Double Hitting Cloud. Have Cloud Tempo Flurry Ice Gigas to land Slow (Medal Req).

* Advance on Cloud once Ice Gragas is down to 10% HP. Wall up again at this point if Y'shtola took enough DPS to regain it (RNG).

* One hero can die since there's no KO requirement (Vivi in my case)

520,"My +++ Advantaliate strat:

http://i.imgur.com/3e9zLRY.jpg

* This strat was reliant on having Red XII's Lunatic High SB, but not necessary

* Strat is also seriously luck based with landing Sleep and hoping Melusine doesn't use too many AOE attacks in a row

* Diaga was useless, not used at all. Would replace with Haste.

* I also have Y'shtola's SS SB, but didn't use it. 

* Replace Black Materia with Advance (Forgot to screenshot before battle)

**Gear**

* All Gear with the exception of the Retaliator was chosen to Max Resistance

* Retaliator's gear is Max Attack, obviously

**Directions:**

1st turn

* S/L until Y'shtola's bar starts full, try to land Sleep ASAP 1st try

* Advance with your Retaliator

* Shellga with Lenna

* Lunatic High if you got it

2nd Turn

* Cast Retaliate, alternate to Double Hit after

* Support alternates between using Breaks and Attacking the Retaliator

* Everyone lands their Double Hits on the Retaliator soon after he Retaliates

* Last move is Sleep by your White Mage

3rd Turn

* Rinse and repeat

This strat is luck based, but as long as you have all 4 of your characters attack just before your White Mage casts Sleep, Melusine will hardly get a chance to attack you after you get your DPS in.

It also takes a second to line up the attack order and getting Sleep off last in the turn order. Thankfully Melusine stays asleep for at least a full turn if your White Mage has over 300 MND.

I'm imagining Goodell sitting in the dark, on an expensive leather chair, a red ember lights up his face as he puffs heavily off a cigar. He's sitting in front of what looks to be hundreds of screens flashing footage from the various NFL games going on.

All of a sudden they all flash red, the screens merge to show a 'Patriot' alert. The Patriots are on 3rd down and 20 backed deep into their side of the field, Tom Brady just threw a 55 yard pass to pull them out of a dire losing situation, but a flag was thrown.

Ed Hochuli radios into Goodell, his voice echoing around the dark room, ""What is your wish, master?""

Goodell takes a second to exhale a thick cloud of tobacco smoke and utters the words, ""Bury them.""

""As you wish,"" Hochuli says as he quickly retreats out from under the black hood of the review box, not wishing to displease his master with any trivial questioning.

The Patriots fate has been sealed. 

As we fade out, all we're left with is the image of a smirk crawling across Goodell's face as the lights dim, cigar embers now burning white hot.",2015-12-17 20:27:42+00:00,cy2lsr9,3.0,t1_cy2l9iv,794.0,Patriots

There's no one way to generalize a heterogeneous populace.

My impression is that the Japanese will treat a foreigner well upon first impression, help you where you need to go, be polite, etc. 

But are they not doing that because it's what is expected of them? You know, being good because you want to versus being good because something tells you to?

I've always been fascinated by informal and formal social control mechanisms and how these vary within hetero/homogeneous societies. 

Informal meaning there are unspoken laws that govern how you act, versus formal which are actual laws that restrict behavior. 

Japan seems to be one of the most homogeneous societies in the world, with one of the strongest informal social control mechanisms to boot.

So I think it would be a natural for them to have a general disdain for foreigners.

Yet that shouldn't forgive how xenophobic this comes off to other counties.

Should I as an American,  ever step foot in Japan I would imagine whatever kindness I did receive would be at face value.

578,"After having read the article I think he's got a valid concern. Disregard the Mars mission and focus on the growing threat of global warming. There's some serious studies out there that say if we increase the average temp of the earth by another couple degrees over the next 50-100 years or so we'll hit a point of no return. 

This could spell the end of life as we know it, let alone the threat of a nuclear holocaust. 

It's important for us as a species to do as much as we can to explore our options should we turn the earth into an inhospitable place. Colonizing other planets is a good option. Perhaps an ideal option if you consider the earth as a finite resource and human life as an exponential drain on it. 

I think Musk's argument centers around the idea that war on a global scale delays, limits, or even kills our options to proliferate. So it's in our best interest to remain relatively peaceful with one another until we can solidify our options.

716,"Funny thing about American Football, shit maybe even Baseball. Cheating is institutionalized. Once it was called 'gamesmanship', now it's 'getting the edge' on your opponent.

Joe Montana said recently, 

&gt; ""You know, everybody does everything they can to possibly get a little bit of an edge. I mean, back then it wasn’t illegal but it was illegal, like our guys used to spray — and everybody did it at the time — silicone on their jerseys, the linemen, so that the defensive linemen couldn’t get a hold of them. And the defensive linemen did it so the offensive linemen couldn’t hold them,” Montana said. “It’s a game. Everybody wants to win, so you do whatever you can to make it happen.”

Obviously the NFL has evolved past this kinda stuff. But stuff like PED use and pumping crowd noise into stadiums is a thing teams are getting fined for in the modern era.

Of course no one blames their team if they get caught. ""It was a misunderstanding"",  ""it's bullshit"", ""it's not that bad compared to *(insert worse cheat)*"", or ""everybody does it"".

Yet if it's not your team, and that team happens to be one of the most winning teams in the NFL then everyone just loses their goddamn mind.

Cognitive dissonance, people.

I'm spoiled, but I know it.

Even before 15 I remember my parents and friends screaming at the TV about the pre-BB era Patriots and how they fucked up again. So I do have some reference to a historically darker time.

Though I wasn't really a fan at that point. Only when they won the '01 Superbowl and the following jubilee and happiness that erupted, did I convert.

The point being, I think there's a lot of fans who only know the Pats as a winning team. It's easy to be a fan when there's little risk of your emotions getting crushed by hard losses, stupid mistakes and bad coaching.

803,"I'm struggling with this as well, but I think I'm going to start Olsen based on the match-ups.

Baltimore is in a must win scenario facing a 0-3 start if they lose, albeit losing a divisional game to the Bengals. They're at home, still have a strong defense even with the loss of Suggs, and they're the best versus TEs, even it's only a two week sample size. 

The Saints on the other hand, are floundering with an already poor looking defense/secondary and a cool offense with a probable injury to both Brees and Cooks. This may bode well for the strong Carolina defense who I expect will limit the amount of time the Saints get on the field. 

I think Eifert has the better upside this week, but if neither Olsen or Eifert get a TD then I think Olsen will have more points, based on the amount of looks he gets from Newton, in what should be a large margin win over the Saints.

Also, someone was saying that Ravens/Bengals games are generally low scoring with only a TD or FG separating the winner from the loser.

806,"Lets put aside the idea that you're bringing in all new unskilled and untrained labor to take the jobs of those who already know how to do them, at least at the competent level, for the moment. In a factory setting that would be highly dangerous, but if this is just voice acting you can take the danger element out of the equation.

So what you're left with is a group of people who have entered into a collective bargaining agreement with a company/corporation, with the goal in mind of getting or maintaining workers rights. Workers rights usually include the right to a living wage, sufficient benefits, time off and certain guarantees that you won't lose your job for various and/or ambiguous reasons stipulated in the contract. 

Eventually the Union begins butting heads with the company, company isn't doing enough to support the workers or the workers are asking for too much and it's hurting the company.

Either way, the Union decides to strike, meaning the company can't continue to make its product since there are no workers to make it.

Union heads sit down with the company over the dispute, a lot of compromising and back and forth happens, eventually they come to terms or bring the issue to court and then everyone goes back to work.

But if say you didn't want to give in at all to any union demands, you hire strike breakers to work while your unionized employees strike.

Most would view this as a means to simply subvert your working right. Imagine coming into work only to see a minority sitting at your desk doing you job for half or a quarter of the cost you think its worth, though you couldn't afford the cost of living with what they were originally paying you.

Others would view strikebreakers as a valuable form of leverage to force Unions to accept least favorable terms or conditions. ""See how easy it is for us to replace you?""

As someone who works in a corporation, and like millions of others who sign a contract basically saying the company has the right to fire me for any legal reasons (trust me there are many bullshit legal excuses to fire someone), I support the notion that Unions are a good thing to have, even if you don't agree with them.

Because at the end of the day, we would never have had child labor laws, a 5 day workweek, paid time off, sick leave, minimum wage and a variety of other benefits we take for granted if Unions had never existed in the first place.",2015-09-23 21:23:48+00:00,cvbu81k,5.0,t1_cvbrahb,4157.0,Games

They had a bunch of one liners from a couple of Tommy's friends saying that he generally bends over backwards for the wife. However there's been a noticable uptick in Giselle becoming more unreasonable and more controlling.

913,"I don't think that's quite it. 

Scandinavian countries have effective social control mechanisms that keep tradition, culture and norms intact throughout multiple generations.

This stems from a largely homogeneous population.

It's fair to assume then that these countries wouldn't do well with a large influx of refugees, since immigrants have entirely different social control mechanisms, that will then need to be unlearned via cultural assimilation.

Which many of these immigrants would probably not want to do. Or would probably take as an attempt to strip them of their identities, or perhaps even an attack on their inherit religious beliefs.

A very heterogeneous country such as the U.S. wouldn't have such a problem with immigrants because we have so many laws, regulations, and red tape to effectively control them. The product of a couple hundred years of racism, bigotry and fear.

That doesn't mean we accept immigrants wholeheartedly. Quite the opposite really. But we don't bother with social control mechanisms, in favor of just making hard laws for all.",2015-08-20 20:25:46+00:00,cu9vwna,3.0,t1_cu9m5ws,14453.0,worldnews

915,"I think you gotta give the owner, Kraft a lot of credit.

He bought the team in '94, and before that was a season ticket holder since the 70s. Didn't want to see the team move to St. Louis and had the money to buy/save the team.

He is the perfect owner, absolutely loves football, modest (for a billionaire), sees the big picture, not fixated on short term success, savvy investment wise, more than happy to yield to the people in his organization that know more about football, and will bend over backwards to give them what they need in order to let them do their jobs well.

&gt; Since Kraft bought the team, the Patriots have won AFC East titles in 1996, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014; they represented the AFC in the Super Bowl in 1996 (lost), 2001 (won) 2003 (won) 2004 (won) 2007 (lost) 2011 (lost) and 2014 (won). The Patriots finished the 2003, 2004, and 2010 seasons with identical 14–2 regular-season records, and also finished the 2007 regular season undefeated before losing to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII.

&gt;Kraft was principally involved in the 2011 NFL labor negotiations.

Unfortunately now that I know S-E is remaking or rather re-imagining the game, it's unlikely that I'll install the mod. I know the author put his heart and sole into it.

I wonder how the author feels about the FFVII remake announcement? Happy because the game he loves is getting a modern touch? Or a little jaded that all the work he put into re-translating the *entire* game isn't going to get as much love as it deserves.

Regardless I suppose I should still play through FFVII before the remake comes out. But for whatever reason I lose interest shortly after leaving Midgar in search of Sephiroth and that's that.",2015-06-26 21:48:00+00:00,csjw18z,1.0,t3_3b8331,10484.0,Games

Goodell is a punching bag that they all elected to be the face of the organization and to that end he's doing exactly what he was hired to do, taking punches.

Stability is good for business and if Kraft rocked the boat he would risk losing his standing with the other owners. Not to mention that I'm sure Kraft won't forget this and will probably try to do more inside the NFL to remedy this injustice. More so than would be capable outside of it under the scrutiny of the public and the media.

It goes without saying that if Kraft fought the way he said he would, it would probably end up hurting the Pats more so in the long run. I imagine there's a lot of behind the scenes dealings in the NFL.

In a court of lies the truth is hearsay.

It doesn't matter what facts are presented to Goodell now, the 4 game ban will stick and Brady will go to court.

This entire ordeal from the start has been a means to keep the NFL in the media, and the spotlight off one terrible year of bad publicity.

I can't see why the NFL would want to end the charade now and let Brady off the hook, when another couple months of Brady in court would still keep people talking.

Here in the mainstream media, we like to propagandize the masses to fit our agendas, and one sure-fire way of doing so is to use snarl words.

Urban dictionary defines a snarl word as, *A word used to induce a negative response or association in the person hearing or reading it. Commonly used to appeal to people's emotions rather than their reasoning, to get them on your side*

Don't like that gosh-darn Democratic candidate and his common-sense agenda? Why you simply call him a *Liberal* and you'll polarize half the population against him!

You see, it doesn't matter what the those pesky facts are. So long as you use enough snarl words, people won't be thinking rationally. Emotion will instead take over and they'll repeat your propaganda ad nauseam!
