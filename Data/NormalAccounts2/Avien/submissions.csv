Stupid tips as I call them, because this stuff took me longer to figure out than I care to admit

Thanks to /u/jojomexi for the help!

---

**Friend Tips**

* Change your desired gift to Friend Points as soon as possible (Friends -&gt; Send Gifts). Default is set to Gil, so click on the Gil icon and change to Friend Points.

* There's a 'Send All' and 'Receive All' button that you can click when Gifting with your friends.

* Giving Friends a gift doesn't take it from your inventory, so 'Send All' all the time!

* Have a full Friends List? Inactive friends aren't gifting you. Consider sorting your Friend List by 'Last Played' + 'Descending' and unfriending people who haven't signed on in over 5+ days (5 is debatable, some are saying 2-3 days max)

* Max out your friend slots asap. cap is 130. You will gain friend points way faster this way (i.e. You do this because FPs give you more units, faster, and more units makes enhancing units easier, which makes building Trust Masteries quicker) 

---
**Leveling Tips**

* *Grandshelt Catacombs - Exit* is the best Story Mission to grind for Gil/Exp/Rank XP as you get tons of items, XP comparable to Esper grinding, and 78 Rank XP for just 3 NRG (plus you can auto battle and not even worry)

* Exp is split dependent on the number of units in your team (e.g. 30k Exp / 5 Units = 6k Exp per Unit) regardless if they are max level. Currently the friend unit does not absorb any of the Exp.

---

**NRG Efficiency Tips**

* Starting a mission uses the NRG (i.e. energy) as soon as it starts, so you can use this fact to your advantage. You can quit the app and since the NRG has been used, it can recharge. You can finish the mission later.

* Make sure you use all 'Colosseum orbs' and NRG before ranking up. Both refill on 'rank up'

* Pay attention to when you are claiming items from the Message Board. If you claim free NRG, and you do not have room for all of it, it will go to waste.

* Your NRG won't ""overcharge"" when it's not full in the first place.
(e.g. You have 15/30 NRG. Accepting 20 NRG from the daily logins/ gift box will only fill you to 30. However if you're at 30/30, accepting the 20 NRG will bring you to 50/30 NRG. **Note:** Sometimes this bugs out and you'll lose the NRG)

---

**Party Tips**

* Eldin (Thief) is a unit you get from Standard Draw. He gains a passive Auto-Potion skill. Don't use him if you value your Potions. Instead, try Paul (Bandit) if you need a Steal.

* Hate switching party all the time? Go to Menu, then Options, then scroll to the bottom. You can set a party for Colosseum and another to hold your Companion for friends. (i.e. Your friends will see whatever unit currently assigned as your Party Leader unless you do this)

---

**Unit Tips**

* During battle, if you tap and hold on either an enemy unit or one of your units afflicted with a buff/debuff/status effect, a useful display screen pops up depicting the unit's current status.

* You can't bring a Gil Snapper or Metal Cactuar into battle... no matter how hard you try

* Sell all the Gil Snapper for Gils (Unit -&gt; Sell Unit)

* Use the Metal Cactuars for Unit Exp (Unit -&gt; Enhancement)

* Increase your unit capacity so that you can hold more junk units to increase trust.

* Make sure you are only fusing the junk units with other junk units of the same kind to increase their trust (goes up 5% every unit fused of the same type)

* Once you gain 100% trust with any unit, you will gain that ability as an equitable ability.

* You can have multiple trust abilities of the same kind, so once you have 100% trust with a unit, you can start trusting up another same unit.

* If you do not have 3*+ premium units that can Paralyze or cause Poison, max level and utilize Biggs for Bio Blaster(high chance to poison), and Rizer for Blade Bash(paralyze). (i.e. This is a beginner strategy for taking on the White Dragon in the Farplane; defeating it gives you Masamune (+60 ATK)

* On the home screen and some individual unit screens, you can tap a unit to see their attack animation. This doesn't mean anything but just something to see I suppose.

---

**Misc Tips**

* You can Unlock 1 Vortex Dungeon at a time with no cost to your Lapis (Many players choose to use this 1 Free Dungeon on the *Chamber of Experience* so that they can power level their units)

* You can increase your Limit Break experience by actually using your Limit Breaks.

* 'NEXT' will be perpetually displayed over 'Port City Lodin' after you clear all current content after 'Infernal Hollow'

* Only ever need 1 full stack of any material at any given time, therefore if you have over 99 of one material, sell the extra's, and then sell about a good ~20 of the full stack so you dont immediately use another slot.

Our only dev was pushing for a change to MediaWiki rather than the latest Tiki version.

He however found a new job and left the project, which I am now responsible for. Not to mention I have very little programming/web-dev experience.

Regardless, one key features for us was using Tiki's Dynamic Content System to program blocks of schedules that we would reference in various Wiki pages based on upcoming dates and their subsequent expiration.

We also use a lot of bulleted lists in our Wiki pages which have a ton of nested collapsible elements in them. TikiWiki has 'expandable areas' which makes this easy (Add a '-' after your '*'). MediaWiki has
    &lt;div class=""mw-collapsible mw-collapsed""&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 
Which doesn't appear to be very friendly to our lists.

I've done a bit of digging, but I can't really find something similar to DCS in MediaWiki, or something easy like 'expandable areas' either.

**TL;DR:** I would very much appreciate it if anyone could give me a quick comparison of MediaWiki to TikiWiki, and if there's any advantage to using MediaWiki when we're reliant on the DCS provided by Tiki? 

Should I push my manager to scrap the upgrade to MediaWiki and just upgrade to the latest Tiki version?

I think my ex-coworker might have been pushing for MediaWiki since it might be better at embedding tables and external objects? Does that make any sense?

I don't know about you all, but The Excelsior was my favorite bar in Albany before Susie shooed the owner out of the Cafe 217 extension on Lark St. 2 years ago.

If you're unfamiliar with the concept, Excelsior featured **only** New York State beer, wine and liquor. At the time it was a cash only establishment, and featured a 'two-mug' purchase of whatever two beers you wanted to try for anywhere between $4-10.

It also had the Excelsior Pub Club for members who got discounted pricing on beer volume with their tall boy glass.

As the place currently stands, the owner has just set up shop which means that the bar is put together, minus some decorations and quality of life upgrades. Hasn't got any NYS wine yet though he said it's coming soon. He also now accepts credit cards.

You'll find:

* 15 or so different New York State featured beers on tap

&gt; Pricing scales based on whatever size mug, glass or combination you want (ask for a beer menu) 

* New York State liquors and a good amount of variety in that

* Basic food menu (New York hotdogs, wings, roast beef sandwich)

* 3 dartboards (cork boards, not electronic)

* 3 HDTVs (Can request your favorite football team on Sundays)

* Good people, great owner. The owner is a fun person to talk to and makes you feel welcomed. He's also great at discouraging the unsavory, asshole types from coming back. 

Jay the owner and barkeep of The Excelsior, is now located at [54 Philip St, Albany, NY 12207](https://goo.gl/maps/AS6rmFAVEaC2) across the street from Hill Street Cafe, on the corner (downtown Madison Ave.)

If you're worried about the area, you shouldn't be. I've been around that area many times, and been to the bar itself over 5 times now and haven't had any issues. It also helps that the Hill Street Pub is a bit of a cop bar.

It's also a nice reprieve from Lark and Pearl St. where the bars are usually overcrowded and too noisy to have any decent conversation. Not to mention free parking on the weekends at the garage across the street.

If you guys have any questions, here's his website: http://theexcelsiorpub.com/ and if you're look for a pub-goer's opinion I'm more than happy to help.

**Broncos**

&gt;The only thing that pisses me off about this is how much we're gonna have to hear about it from Pats fans.

&gt;I don't really care. I thought it was stupid he got a 4 game suspension in the first place. At most, I thought he could get 1 game suspension because it seemed like he was blocking the investigators, but I don't think I would say that anymore either. The only thing this debacle proved was how stupid the NFL seems to be at handling investigations and punishments.
Besides, if Brady was suspended and we went on to get the first round bye and the eventual SB, you know damn well Patriot fans will say it was because Brady's 4 game suspension.

**Jaguars**

&gt;It will be even better when we beat Brady himself.

&gt; Let's not get deflated about it. Victory just going to be that much sweeter after we knock the wind out of them. Let's all just talk a deep breath and then let all that air out slowly.
Now doesn't that feel better?

**Colts**

&gt;Good. Now Brady's first game back is against the Steelers and not us.

&gt;Not sure if we even care at this point.

**Texans**

&gt;I think it was the right call. If the NFL wanted properly inflated balls, they should have had some sort of procedure in place when they first heard about the tampering. They have one now, let's move on.

&gt;Whether he was involved or not, being suspended 4 games with zero direct evidence was ridiculous. As for the failure to cooperate, Favre wasn't suspended a single game for dickgate
This is a huge win for the players

**Steelers**

&gt;Oh fuck it's going to angry Brady against our defense

&gt;As the great James Harrison once said ""I want him on the field. So when we beat them and win. There will be no excuses.""

**Browns**

&gt;I know this doesn't pertain to the Browns directly, but Pukesburgh first game of the season will now be against Tom Brady. Good news overall for our division race.

&gt; **FreeJoshGordon**

**Bengals**

*[In reference to Pacman Jones tweeting ""lmao"" at Goodell]*

&gt;Sure, it's dumb. But Goodell can't suspend him for doing that. I don't see how it will end poorly besides Jones getting a talking to by our coaching staff.

&gt;[hhhuehuehuehue](http://i.imgur.com/imIwsiS.png)

**Ravens**

&gt;Oh, I'm really happy Brady's suspension got reversed because

&gt;1. It was meritless.

&gt;2. I think it helps us. I think we should worry more about the Steelers than the Patriots. The Patriots are about seeding. The Steelers are about getting into the playoffs.

&gt;PSA: Don't feed the trolls, downvote, report, ignore, and move on

**Jets**

&gt;Great comment from a Bills fan in the /r/nfl thread

&gt;&gt;While a lot of us wanted to see Brady and the Patriots get screwed, this is actually a big win for everyone. It is, and always has, been absurd that Goodell acts as his own arbitrator and this is a first step towards rectifying that. So as much as I wanted to face JimmyG in Week 2, in the long run, this is the best result for the long term integrity of the league and the next time a player on your favorite team has to face Goodell.

&gt;I fucking hate Brady as a Jets fan, but I'm glad someone told Goodell he can't just hand out arbitrary suspensions just to swing his dick around and show off his power.

**Dolphins**

&gt;I'm going to preempt the inevitable anti-Pats circlejerk and say this is a good thing. The whole situation was bullshit

&gt;Looking forward to Wake and Suh demolishing the little bitch Brady. Bring it on, Patsies.

**Bills**

&gt; I have no complaints, actually. Looking at the transcript, the judge didn't rule that Brady didn't cheat, but rather that the punishment given by Goodell was too harsh and unreasonable.

&gt;Our D-Line is gonna destroy Brady so bad he wishes he was suspended for that game.

&gt; Secondary is gonna get torched by Romo and Dez. Bring it on.

&gt;At least Romo finally has the chance to beat Brady before they both retire.
