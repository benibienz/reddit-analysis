a brief run down of each role

solo goes to the short lane, your job is to get as much farm as possible to get a massive level lead and build tank so you can act as a bruiser frontline, tank up damage in team fights so your carries can fight safely

mid, high clear high damage, usually a mage but hunters are not uncommon on more experienced players, your job is to rotate with your jungle around clearing mid waves and camps to maximize farm, in team fights stay out of auto range and wait for your tanks to bait out abilities, go in burst squishy targets and then back up to wait for your cooldowns to come back up

adc, usually a hunter unless you play sol or chronos who are in hand mages, your job is to shred targets with constant damage from inhands, farm the long lane with support and stay at max range of your autos to minimize the risk of taking damage from melee gods

jungle rotates with mid clearing mid and the jungle and looking to gank over extended lanes to create pressure, usually an assassin, most people will build hybrid damage frotline unless playing a pure assassin, you want to look to maximize your cdr and damage and in team fight look to pick carries and get out

support helps the adc farm the long lane early and then rotates to mid to get more farm and be central to assist the team wherever needed, builds full tank and looks to engage with blink and or big aoe cc to set up team fights

266,"well after the top 100 the 101 player in masters has almost 300 tp and thats just what we can see from the leaderboard, and there are more players at a given tp in masters the lower you go. Thats a lot of players to move down and then theres all the high diamond players who arent far from moving up, diamond will become like bronze where the skill gap in that division is very large and that shouldnt happen at a high devision",2016-02-01 21:18:23+00:00,czk5wqm,2.0,t1_czk5kcz,481.0,Smite

268,"smite is the only moba i play but from my understanding league has challenger which is above masters and is only top 100 i think, youre forcing and entire tier -100 down into a lower division, i think masters and grand masters is a great prospect because since masters has no tp cap there is huge gaps in skill within it, adapting 2334tp atm, vs someone who just barely gets the promo, huge difference",2016-02-01 18:52:38+00:00,czjzlx2,2.0,t1_czjzb4h,413.0,Smite
269,"her old ult was on a 30 sec cd, same as sylv, i wouldnt mind returning it if her 2 became a mobility ability, maybe a mini version of her current ult, it would be equivelent to hou yis jump and would give her more options, i just wouldnt want to trade out her only escape for a pull with her current kit

271,"I'm just calling it a steroid because its definitely isn't a cast ability with a targeter, also her 2 is part of what makes her so hard to box so by changing it to what i suggested it would remove some of her boxing potential and somewhat re-balance, and a pull wouldn't make her op in team fights, it would help her be able to do what she wants, 1v1 someone, so her team fight is taking the adc or mage out of the team fight, i wouldn't mind  if the spot she landed webbed the floor with a cripple but i think spawning spiders would definately be op, but giving some incentive for aggressively ulting would be nive",2016-02-01 18:21:35+00:00,czjy9f9,4.0,t1_czjxyvn,412.0,Smite

273,"many people myself included still do well with her, but i think her biggest problem is her web has no scaling so becomes rather irrelevant in terms of damage and then she has 2 aa steroids that are very brief and an ult that is primarily going to be held for escape considering she has no dash/jump which makes her do very little in team fights, so late game she pretty much does nothing but auto and in the cc/burst meta being rienforced in season 3 she just doesnt do what she needs to do to be relevant in a team fight, i build tank and basically front line and peel for the team lategame but being an assassin i would like more damage options
