I think the solution is to put a class modifier for stats, for instance if you buy breastplate of valor lets say it has 60 phys prots if youre a guardian its +20, assassin +5, warrior +10, mage +0, hunter +0, not actual numbers just an idea, because with the current system there will never be a way to make good items for guardians that cant get abused by other classes

I think most players and I used to look forward to new patches and new content, these days a new patch is dreaded, how will this next patch tear down the game further.

We had throwing dagger, susano and new rat all so close together, all 3 make the game a lot less fun, this isnt a discusion of how to balance the game but im just using this as an example, hirez says susano is balanced because his damage numbers are inline and win rate is average, cool, that means on paper he seems fine, however what they cant capture in numbers is how it feels playing or playing against that character. 

Thowing dagger, cool that almost any adc can be played competitively now, except... you arent picking nieth or apollo, early clear or late game carry, youre picking thowing dagger, that item killed all the originality, perks and flaws of hunters. Adc's all have the same strong early game now and that killed the fun of adc for me.

Hirez needs to obviously balance things that are too strong, but also should look to fix things that are making the game less fun to play, and keep it fresh, many roles are getting stale due to staple gods dominating for long periods of time, change things around, theres quite a few gods who have been out of meta for a very long time that dont see much play that could be buffed to bring them into the meta for some fresh matchups and team comps

I think Smite should implement a chat command like whisper to call a moderator to the match, maybe /mod, from there they can spectate the match and view the chat coms to see what the situation is, it's obvious if the player is trolling or just inexperienced, and then they need to have actual penalties for infractions, not just reducing good will, bans, bans that increase with severity based on the seriousness and number of times the player has committed the infraction.

In casuals these are just annoyances, but in leagues it negatively affects peoples ranking and match making quality, we all know amazing players who can't climb out of bronze because they lose one match because of a troll or DC and it takes away as much TP as 2-4 wins, how is that fair? In a league situation the mod should be able to null the match if there is a legitimate problem like how they reward the winning team but don't penalize the losing team if the servers are unstable. Another possibility is if they made a mandatory minimum internet speed to play, I have friends who have poor internet and they constantly get kicked from games, if this happens in ranked this almost guarantees a loss.

Communication is key to a successful round of Smite, so Smite should take into account language as well as region when match making. I live in NA, here English and Spanish are both very common and too many times there is a language barrier. I can only imagine how much worse it is in worse Europe.

Finally we all love our SPL, but if you have a team you cannot queue with them in ranked, I think they should offer a ranked 5 man queue so we can prove our skills with our team, after all even the pros don't do as well without their teammates who know their play style and strategies.

I feel like we should start a petition to HiRez to clean up their community and improve their ranked system, we all love the game but there are definite issues that need to be addressed.

Just sharing my thoughts
 
Thanks for reading.
