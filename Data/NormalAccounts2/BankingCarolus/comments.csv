Pretty much exactly the same online, mobile and telephone banking experiences as the other current and former members of LBG (Lloyds, Halifax, TSB).

1,"&gt;As such my credit score is terrible.

The important thing is the information on your credit reports, rather than the score itself. The score provided reflects how the agency views your report, but the information given to lenders is the report, from which they will generate their own score. If you haven't done so already I'd get hold of your reports from the three agencies and make sure all the information on them is correct and up to date, that there aren't any more problems than the defaults you know about etc. If there are issues then it is important to try and get these corrected. You can get your Equifax and CallCredit reports for free via Clearscore and Noddle, and your Experian report for £2.

&gt;What is the best way to use this to my advantage? Max it out and pay it back in full every month or so.etbinf else?

I'm not sure whether maxing it out is the best option - this might suggest to lenders that you need to use that much credit each month. I'm sure others can say more about utilisation ratios, but I might aim for about 30% or so. Whatever you do, make sure you pay it off in full every month - if you don't then that interest rate will hurt you, and it will also get reported to the reference agencies.",2016-10-19 11:29:19+00:00,d8yl3l8,1.0,t3_589m1i,2927,UKPersonalFinance

6,"Revolut is a good bet. It's a prepaid mastercard controlled via an app. They give the Mastercard exchange rates (which are very good), and the app allows you to convert your money beforehand or to convert as you use it. A couple of things to note: there's a limit on cash withdrawals per month (more than £500 and they hit you with a 2% charge for subsequent withdrawals) and there's a somewhat hidden 0.5% extra charge over the weekends built into the rates. All that said, it's a very convenient way of paying abroad and I haven't had any issues when using it.

Another option is Monzo. They're currently offering a prepaid mastercard whilst they are building up to launching their current accounts, and this also offers Mastercard exchange rate for foreign transactions. It doesn't allow you to hold foreign currencies on the card like the Revolut card, and also has a waiting list at the moment.

Both their apps will categorise your spending and allow you to lock your card when not in use if you wish. Having used both, I think for my purposes (basically day to day spending) I marginally prefer using my Monzo card, but Revolut does have some features Monzo doesn't and is easier to gt hold of at the moment.

EDIT: Another difference between the two is the way the exchange rate is determined. Revolut give you the exchange rate at the time when you make the payment (and the 0.5% fee over the weekends seems to be linked to this), whereas Monzo will use the rate when the payment is settled, normally a couple of days later.",2016-09-17 23:53:22+00:00,d7r5al1,1.0,t3_537vt4,27124,UKPersonalFinance
7,"I'd say the accounts to start with are the Nationwide FlexDirect and the TSB Classic Plus. The Nationwide will pay 5% on £2500, but only for 12 months. TSB will pay 5% on £2000.

To maximise the interest from the Nationwide account, I'd suggest starting by putting the full £2.5k in and leaving it there. The rest of your savings (initially £100, then more each month) should then go into the Classic Plus until it is full.

Both of these accounts have a minimum amount that must be paid in each month - £500 for TSB and £1000 for Nationwide. To meet this you can just transfer £1k from Nationwide to TSB and then back again. This can be automated if you like, but initially you'd need to do it on subsequent days so that you can be sure you aren't trying to move more money out of the TSB account than there is within it.

Once your savings start to build up beyond the amounts needed to fill the TSB account, you could consider Tesco account (3% on £3000, can have two). There is also the Club Lloyds acocunt which pays 4% on £4k-5k, but then you need a minimum of £4k to get the best interest rate (below that is 2%) so I suggest leaving this until you've built up your savings further.",2016-08-30 01:38:31+00:00,d721ozn,1.0,t3_507zge,8389,UKPersonalFinance

9,"I think the fee-free and cash withdrawals have been covered elsewhere, but I'd point out that if you want high interest rates, then there are high interest current accounts available. These pay 3-5% on a certain amount of cash (a few thousands). 

The best of these for everyday spending is currently the TSB Classic Plus. This pays 5% interest on the first £2000 in the account, as well as 5% cashback on the first £100 of contactless spending each month. You need to pay in £500 each month, but this can easily be met, eg by transferring money in and out again from another account.

As you build up savings above £2000, you can easily open accounts with other banks, including Lloyds, Nationwide, Bank of Scotland and Tesco into which you can put your savings and take advantage of the high interest rates (i.e. just use these current accoutns as savings accounts).",2016-08-29 17:22:23+00:00,d71fole,1.0,t3_5045au,29095,UKPersonalFinance
10,"The best options for cash savings will be high-interest current accounts. Depending on the amount of savings you are likely to accumulate you will likely need multiple accounts, as they each pay interest only on a certain amount of money.

The currently available high-interest current accounts are:

* TSB Classic Plus - 5% on £2000
* Nationwide FlexDirect - 5% on £2500 for 12 months
* Club Lloyds - 4% on £4k-£5k, lower rates for balances below that, 2 Direct Debits required, also gives you a ""lifestyle reward""
* Bank of Scotland Vantage - 3% on £3k-5k, lower rates for balances below that, 2 Direct Debits required, can have 3 of these accounts
* Tesco Current Account - 3% on £3k, can have two

It's likely that many of these rates will drop in the next few months as well. I've omitted the Santander as we know that one will be dropping. Most of these accounts have minimum payins required each month which you can meet via transfers from other accounts.

Which accounts you should open initially depends mostly on whether you have some savings accumulated already. For example the Club Lloyds is only worth it if you can be sure that you'll always keep a balance over 4k to get the highest rate, whilst the Nationwide only lasts 12 months, so to maximise interest you'd probably want to put 2.5k in there and leave it.

Without any other specifics though, the TSB is definitely worth opening - it also pays 5% cashback on contactless spending (on the first £100 each month).",2016-08-29 17:14:09+00:00,d71faoi,1.0,t3_505uos,2761,UKPersonalFinance

I'd then open a TSB classic plus to get the 5% interest on any funds remaining above £4k.

19,"I have a few questions and comments:

1. To check I'm reading this correctly - you've listed the values of everything each month from Jan to Jul.  Are the things with values in months beyond that your projections, or are they values from last year? (I am assuming it's the former).

2. When does the FlexDirect 12 months end? January? If so, it seems likely you'll have a lot of money needing new homes at this point, as the regular savers expire around then.

3. My guess is that your intention will be to use some of this money to pay off the Sainsbury's card, is this correct? I'd suggest making sure you have a clear plan on when and how to pay this off, and make sure that you keep spending on it under control. Whatever you do, don't miss the end of the interest free period.

4. As mentioned below, you can have two Tesco accounts - I'd suggest once you've filled one of them you open and work on filling the second as well - I think this seems a sensible place to put the next batch of savings. As I understand it, Tesco have said they don't intend to cut the interest rate so that should be reasonably safe. 
There are a couple of other high interest current accounts you could consider either now or in future (but they are under review, so seem likely to lose at least some of their benefits). These are the Club Lloyds (4% on balances between £4k and £5k, 2DDs, also get a ""lifestyle reward"") and Bank of Scotland Classic Vantage (3% between £3k and £5k, 2DDs, can have 3). I don't think there's any immediate advantage to the BoS over the Tesco accounts, but if you would be able to put £4k into the Club Lloyds, it might be worth considering.

5. I certainly don't think there's much advantage to lending in the Ratesetter 30 day market unless you've already filled all the high-interest accounts, or are just in it for the bonus. This is just because you'd be taking more risk for less gain.

6. I notice the S&amp;S ISA dropped in value significantly between June and July. Was this because you withdrew money? What is your portfolio within the ISA?

7. What is HJRC?

If you have already filled them then it's worth bearing in mind that the £5/month fee on the 123 reduces the interest rate so that it will be effectively 1.2% if you have 20k, reducing for balances below that, at which point there are other easy access savers available. If it is the case that you've filled the others then you might consider putting some of this into, say, a stocks and shares isa of some description instead of keeping it as cash.

This means there is no advantage interest wise to having more than £2000 in the account.
There is, however, one reason to put more money in the account. You can get 5% cashback on the first £100 you spend contactlessly each month, so you might consider putting an extra £100 in at the start and putting some of the contactless spending you do on that (up to £100), although note it isn't worth spending more than you normally would.",2016-08-16 13:31:57+00:00,d6jnh7i,,t1_d6jlxcf,2822,UKPersonalFinance

For the other £500 I'd suggest the Tesco Bank Current Account which pays 3% on up to £3000, so you can easily store more savings in there if you build them up. The only thing to bear in mind is that the TSB account requires a minimum amount paid in each month of £500, but this can be met easily by setting up standing orders to transfer £500 from Tesco into TSB and back again each month. This should earn you about £115 per year on the £2.5k.

If you wanted a simpler option, you could just put the whole lot in a Tesco account, which would earn you about £75 over the year.",2016-08-03 22:10:35+00:00,d633qe3,1.0,t3_4w0ddg,9327,UKPersonalFinance
65,"For savings at the moment, the best interest rates are actually found on Current Accounts. If you are only opening sole accounts then it is currently possible to get £50.5k into bank accounts paying 3-5% interest (averaging a little more than 3%). You would need to open quite a few accounts as each one only pays interest up to a certain balance.
These accounts would be:

TSB Classic Plus - 5% on £2000
Nationwide FlexDirect - 5% on £2500 for 12 months
Club Lloyds - 4% on £5000
Tesco Bank (x2) - 3% on £3000
Bank of Scotland with Vantage (x3) - 3% on £5000
Santander 123 - 3% on £20000, but with £5 fee.

These accounts generally have some requirements like minimum pay in, but this can be met by transferring money around them by standing order each month.

It's possible that you won't want to open so many bank accounts (although opening them online is generally pretty straightforward), but I suspect that even if you only open one or two (say the Santander and the Lloyds) then you would beat putting the whole lot in any ""normal"" savings account just from those two. Perhaps someone else can advise on the best location for the extra £24.5k, although if you are able to open joint accounts then you would be able to fit it into current accounts as well.

The other thing to note is that since you are unemployed, you won't have to pay any tax on interest earned even if it is outside an ISA, so don't need to worry about how much interest you will earn on your £75k.",2016-08-03 14:01:43+00:00,d62gm6q,1.0,t3_4vt2cw,80439,UKPersonalFinance

There are better places to keep it, yes, but in fact the best interest rates are on certain current accounts that pay good rates up to a certain balance. This would involve a bit of work to open the various accounts and to set up the standing orders etc to meet funding requirements, but once it's done, should be self-sustaining. I'd expect that you should be able to get at least 3% or so on average on this sort of balance. Accounts I'd have a look at are:

TSB Classic Plus - 5% on £2000
Nationwide FlexDirect - 5% on £2500 for 12 months
Club Lloyds - 4% on £5000

It might be worth looking into if you want to boost your interest for the first year.

In response to your other points:

1. If you just set the maximum pay in that you require (£1500 if you use Club Lloyds) to cycle from one account to the next to the next and you set all the transfers to happen on the same day then it should work out fine, as long as you have more than £1500 in each of the high interest accounts (which I would expect). If you do this then you shouldn't need to worry about which order payments occur in, or having any days in which you are missing interest.

71,"&gt;The only thing I am certain of is the 0.25% for CSD monthly for investing. Is this something that happens every month and takes out 0.25% of your savings?

The 0.25% is the *annual* charge through CSD, but it is *paid* monthly. i.e. you wil pay ~0.02%/month

In terms of Vanguard fees, the only thing you need to worry about is the 0.24% annual management fee that they take.

Since you've chosen CSD, there aren't any charges for fund trading, so I think all you'll have to worry about are the combined 0.49%/year Platform+Fund Management, which is calculated based on the total value of your account, yes.

The [FAQ](https://www.charles-stanley-direct.co.uk/FAQ/#Monthly%20Investing) suggests that you can set up monthly purchases each month of a fund (minimum £50).I think you can pay into the ISA by direct debit, but they're a bit less clear. You definitely can for an SIPP as stated later in the FAQ, and I'd imagine that applies for the ISA as well. (I found another page that makes reference to being able to do it, as well).

The only other thing to notice is that the minimum *initial* purchase in a fund via CSD is £500, but subsequent purchases of that fund can be less.

Since you're on a percentage fee broker and they don't charge for fund dealing this plan seems to make sense to me - for small value ISAs then percentage fee is cheapest, and since dealing is free you don't need to be concerned about what size portions you invest in.

Club Lloyds - 4% on £4000-5000, with lower rates for amounts below that. £1500 pay in and two Direct Debits required. The account also provides a ""lifestyle benefit"" each year, which may or may not be something you'll use. (one of them is cinema tickets).

Secondly, if you are in a sufficiently high tax band and earn enough interest already that you are above the personal interest allowance then keeping you money in the ISA *might* save you a little bit of money.

If neither of those are the case then you are probably right that transferring some or all of the money out might be a good idea to increase your interest. The Santander 123 is one option, and if you just want to set up one account and leave it is probably the simplest. However, if you want to maximise interest then you could get about 1% (~£200) more by spreading the amount around multiple high interest paying accounts. This requires a bit more work to set up as you'd have to open several accounts, but once you've done that shoudl be easy to just leave.

Some quick calculations suggest to me that you could get about 3.7% for £2000 (as against 2.7% on the Santander, taking into account the fee), by using the following combination:

TSB Classic Plus - £2000 @ 5%
Nationwide FlexDirect - £2500 @ 5%
Club Lloyds - £5000 @ 4%
Tesco Current Account x2 - £6000 @ 3%
Bank of Scotland Vantage - £5000 @ 3%

If you also wanted to take some of the remaining money out of the ISA then you are allowed up to three Bank of Scotland accounts each paying 3%. ",2016-07-26 15:34:48+00:00,d5rkrsr,1.0,t3_4uovgt,4136,UKPersonalFinance

My understanding of the ISA rules is that you can open at most one cash ISA *and* one S&amp;S ISA in a year (and also one Innovative Finance ISA, but none of these exist yet) , but the combined total you can pay into them is (for 2016-2017) £15,240. The Help to Buy ISA is a particular type of cash ISA, so having one doesn't prevent you from opening a stocks and shares ISA, but does reduce the total you could put in this year.

I see - in that case this seems like a sensible plan for now, although obviously I'd make sure I opened the highest interest paying accounts first. One thing I suppose to be wary of is that it may well be that the interest rates etc will almost certainly change within these five years, so it's obviously a good idea to keep checking every so often to make sure your plan still holds up.

I notice that you mention above that you are a higher rate tax payer - presumably therefore you are near (or over?) the £500 individual tax free savings limit.

Given how much you currently have in cash, if you think you might be buying a house in the future it doesn't seem like a bad idea to keep paying in to the H2B ISA - even if you aren't sure whether you'll make use of the 25% bonus, the 4% interest is pretty good. If the rate drops then you should be able to transfer to another provider (assuming one has a better rate!).

&gt;I am also interested in investing in a tracker fund like those offered from Vanguard - are thse best done as an isa (bearing in mind I opened an H2B isa this year)?

Yes, doing this through a stock and shares ISA is probably a good idea to shield you from tax etc. If you do decide you want to go down this route then it might be worth bearing in mind that you could transfer in the Coventry Building Society cash ISA that you have without it counting towards your ISA limit for the year.",2016-06-23 13:41:53+00:00,d4kr6xw,1.0,t3_4pgfn4,5017,UKPersonalFinance

95,"As others have said, the Help to Buy ISA should be your first port of call - I'd go for the Virgin one as it currently pays the best (3%) interest. The H2B ISA will also give you a 25% bonus when the time comes to use it towards your deposit. You can pay £1000 of your savings in to open this, and then £200/month (including in the first one).

For the rest of your savings, high interest current accounts are the best bet.

TSB Classic Plus pays 5% on up to £2000 with no Direct Debit requirement and £500/month pay in.

Nationwide FlexDirect pays 5% on up to £2500 (but only for a year), again no DDs and this time a £1000/month pay in.

You should be able to open both of these, deposit money straight from the saver into them, set up standing orders between the two to meet the pay in requirements each month and then just leave them.

You're then left with £5500 from your savings account. If you have 2 Direct Debits you can pay each month then I'd suggest opening the Club Lloyds account which pays 4% on balances from £4-5k, provided you have two direct debits paid out each month from it. (And a £1500 minimum pay in, but again, standing orders to the rescue).

For any remaining savings I'd suggest the Tesco Current Account which pays 3% on up to £3000 with absolutely no requirements (and you can have two!).

If you don't have any DDs for the Lloyds account then you can either get some by using Tesco savings accounts which allow you to pay in by direct debit or just open two Tesco Current Accounts and use that to store the balance.

Finally, for savings you make each month, depending exactly on how much you save I'd first of all make maximum contributions to the help to buy ISA as mentioned above (£200/month), then secondly open the Nationwide Flexclusive regular saver that pays 5%, with a maximum £500 pay in each month.

Since the interest is calculated daily (paid monthly of course), you don't really want to be using this is an actual current account. The only spending you want to be doing from it is (maybe) putting an additional £100 in each month and spending that on contactless to get the 5% cashback.

So for the first few months as you're filling up the account you pay in however much you want (£500, £750 or whatever you like) and leave this money there. Provided the amount you've paid that month is &gt;£500 then you'll get interest corresponding to the total in the account.

However, once you reach £2000 in the account there is no point paying more money in as any money above £2000 will not earn more interest. (You'd presumably then start paying these monthly savings into another account). In order to get the interest though, you must still have at least £500 go into the account each month, but now it can be transferred out again immediately, as rather than paying in to earn interest on it, you're just paying in to meet the interest on the account. 
EDIT: Once you get to this stage you can just set up standing orders to transfer the £500 into and out of the account once a month and forget about it entirely.
EDIT 2: I also forgot to mention in my previous post that the Nationwide and Lloyds accounts also have minimum requirements for paying in to get interest, both of which are higher.

Once you've filled this then the next account is the Nationwide Flexdirect which pays 5% up to £2500 and again, no DDs. However, this only lasts for a year, so you'll have to find somewhere else after 12 months. (EDIT: £1000 monthly pay in)

The other accounts that will be worth considering if/when you've built up savings beyond these are:

Club Lloyds - 4% up to £5000 but, a bit like the Santander, the rate drops if you have less than £4000 in it. This also requires 2 Direct Debits/month to come out of it. (EDIT: £1500 monthly pay in).

For the excess it might be worth looking at the Nationwide Flexdirect - this pays 5% on up to £2500 for 12 months before dropping to 1% (but presumably this won't be an issue for you).

For the First Direct account the switching bonus will make it worthwhile if you plan to hold it over only a year or two or will make use of the regular saver. I'd point out that the fee is also waived if you pay in £1000/month so instead of keeping £1000 in it at all times then you could just use the same trick as for TSB and transfer in £1000 and transfer it out again (maybe keeping a small balance in it). This would free up most of that £1000 for use elsewhere. 

I'd also consider opening a Club Lloyds Current Account which pays interest at 4% for balances from £4000-5000. (and at a lower rate below this). This would give you a place to keep some of the excess, and money that will be dripfed into regular savers. You'd have to be careful though that the balance doesn't drop too low that you earn the lower interest rate. I'd actually consider whether it might be more beneficial to just keep all of the money that would go into the regular saver here and not bother with the RS at all. I'd have to do more detailed calculations than I have time for right now though to be sure. This also requires direct debits which can be sorted via certain tesco savings accounts.

121,"&gt;That said, if this is a 10+ year horizon portfolio, why leave anything in cash at all?

A combination of a few factors - I'll have used up my ISA allowance for this year anyway and hadn't thought too much about opening a regular account in addition. It's also the case that at least some of this cash I hadn't been considering fully as part of any portfolio - it includes emergency fund, and some money I may require in ~3 years time when/if my funding runs out. It's probably true that I'm being overly cautious with the quantities involved, so I'll have another think about it.

&gt;...but that is trivially true - the same logic applies to the tax treatment of ISAs...

It's certainly true that there is a similar risk with ISAs, but I'm not sure that they're exactly the same. With the SIPP the risk lies entirely with the regime in place when I become eligible to withdraw the money, whereas in the case of an ISA, were it to become clear that the final regime would be very unfavourable, it would (presumably) be possible to withdraw the money early and find a better home for it. I agree that given the penalties in place for the forthcoming LISA the two become more similar. All that said, 25% extra makes up for a lot!

This is certainly true, and it seems that Lloyds will beat Halifax if I intend to make 3+ trades/year (and both win over the percentage cost ones I mentioned before). I think this is plausible, so I think Lloyds is now my intended platform.

&gt;Remember VLS100 is already a relatively low risk fund and I personally wouldn't be considering de-risking it further if I were in your position - I'd be doing the opposite - but it just depends on your own risk tolerance.

Just to check I've understood - you presumably mean VLS100 is low-risk in terms of equity funds, rather than low risk over all?
It's true that this is probably an overly cautious approach to be taking, and it's likely that in time I will review it. Since I'll already be maxing out my ISA allowance this year, my plan was to then pay in more next year, rather than bother with a standard trading account as well, but perhaps I should think a bit more about it.

&gt;If you're even considering this though, you should be maxing a H2B ISA currently. It can be converted to a LISA next year, which will likely be as good as a SIPP for basic rate taxpayers (probably better, depending on the actual product offerings) with the added advantage of getting the same bonus if used on a property, not just a pension.

I won't be eligible for a H2B ISA, unfortunately (or for using the property bonus part of the LISA). The SIPP v LISA issue then comes down to whether it would be better to wait to see what the precise details of the LISA offerings are (and the slightly higher amount of money I can put in), against just putting it in an SIPP this year. I sort of suspect holding off in the hopes of an exciting LISA may end up being a case of jam tomorrow.",2016-06-08 09:12:47+00:00,d40npe1,2.0,t1_d40a32x,27575,UKPersonalFinance
123,"Hi, thanks for the response. You're right - I'd got it into my head that the fixed price ones were somewhat more than that. The £40 fee for Lloyds and £1.50 fund trading fee makes it look as if they are the clear winner in that case. I don't suppose you happen to have any knowledge of them as a platform?",2016-06-07 20:40:42+00:00,d3zxxub,2.0,t1_d3znxpq,12734,UKPersonalFinance

125,"My understanding is that the Lifetime ISA won't be coming in until next April. In which case presumably it would be best to put £2,880 into an SIPP this year, at least?

With regards to the SIPP vs S&amp;S ISA question, I think that certainly for the next few years I'd value the flexibility of the ISA. But would it be a mistake to, put the £2,880 into an SIPP and then additionally make use of the ISA allowance?",2016-06-01 15:50:41+00:00,d3rufib,6.0,t1_d3rl4wg,15840,UKPersonalFinance
126,"Hi, thanks for your detailed response - it's certainly given me a lot to think about.

With regards to a few of your points - I'm currently 23, and a fulltime postgraduate student. Barring something dramatic happening, this is likely to remain the situation for another ~2.5-3.5 years. Having thought about it, there is the possibility that I will need to support myself through my savings once my funding runs out in 3 years time, but this depends on how much time I will need to finish and whether I can find alternative sources of funding.

That's a very good point about the Ongoing Charge - I thought I'd looked through the most recent account summary I'd been sent, but I hadn't even noticed that!

With regards to the ISA, how on earth does one go about choosing an appropriate one? Am I right in thinking that the major differences are which funds are available and what sort of fee is charged by the company for holding money in the ISA?

My income won't be above the personal allowance at least so long as I remain a student, so I iamgine the SIPP is less use for me?
