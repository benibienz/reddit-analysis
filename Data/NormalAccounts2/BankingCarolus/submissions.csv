Since then the situation has changed a little - I've received an unexpected windfall of ~£20k. My intention is to eventually funnel this into my S&amp;S ISA (and specifically into VLS100), but it won't all fit this year.

This means that I have ~£14k which need something productive to do for the next 8-12 months. Additionally, I also have ~£10k of M&amp;G Managed Growth Fund Inc Class X shares (made on my behalf) which I intend to sell either now (if there is something better to do with it) or in eight months time.

My questions:

1. Is there an obviously more sensible choice between selling and keeping the fund? Historically it hasn't performed too well, and the management fee is high. On the other hand it has risen significantly since the brexit vote (presumably as a consequence of the falling pound). 

2. I am strongly considering using some of the cash to open a small (i.e. £2880) SIPP and invest in more VLS100. Is there any compelling reason not to do this, or not to invest in this fund? I am 23, so would hold for a long time. The reason for the low amount is that I am a PhD student, so this is the maximum amount of tax relief I could claim.

3. The only high-interest current accounts not already in use by me are the Santander 123 and 2x Bank of Scotland ones. Is there anything more sensible to do with the extra cash for this timeframe (8-12 months) than to put it into some combination of these? I'd be open to suggestions as I don't have much desire to hold more cash, but suspect that the short time frame until it's likely to go into the ISA doesn't leave me with many options.

I've since gone away and considered further, and now have several further questions. Apologies once again for the long post!

A quick bit of background: I'm a 23 year old postgraduate student, and will likely remain that way for at least three years. I have a reasonable amount of savings, and have been looking into the best ways to grow them. I have no plans to be buying a house in the short-medium term, so am happy to put some of my savings away for the long term (10+ years).

I currently am in the process of opening various high-interest current accounts, and once this process is complete will have around £20k stashed away at an average of a bit under 4% (rising slightly as some moves into various regular savers).
In addition to this I have another ~£20k which is currently in a few places (some in savings account, some in a cash ISA, some in a poorly performing managed fund originally chosen by a grandparent, etc).

My initial plan with this is to use this money to fill a S&amp;S ISA, within which I will invest in passive funds, which I would intend to keep for the long term. I am leaning initially towards either the Vanguard Lifestrategy 80 or 100, perhaps subsequently supplemented by some small further diversification once I get more of a feel for it (or perhaps not!). My understanding is that also I would be able to transfer in my Cash ISA (~£3300) for a total of £18.5k inside the ISA this year.

I have a few specific questions I am hoping people might be able to answer, as well as just a general query as to whether any of this sounds sensible.

1. Broker choice: For this sort of level of investment in funds, inside an ISA, I *think* I have narrowed this down to a choice between Charles Stanley Direct and Cavendish Online. In principle, CO seems to have the slight edge in terms of no exit fees, but if my holding is only in a single (or a few) funds then this is probably a negligible difference. Does anyone have any recommendations between the two? Is CSD noticeably nicer to use?

EDIT: I've been put on to the fact that Lloyds Bank Share Dealing has a £40 annual fee and £1.50/fund trade, albeit with a higher exit fee, so I'm leaning towards them now. Does anyone have any experience with them?

2. Given I'm currently holding a fairly high proportion of my savings in cash, is it plausible to use this as a low (no!)-risk substitute for holding a proportion of my assets in bonds? In which case, is it sensible to got for the VLS100 iver the VLS80?

3. Is it worth, in prinicple, setting up an SIPP and putting in £2880 to get the tax relief? This seems in principle like a sensible idea, and I'm not concerned about putting this much away for the very long term. On the other hand this seems to depend somewhat on the whims of the government in 40 years time, in terms of the eventual withdrawal regime. Other options would include waiting until next years ISA allowance, or the LISAs (although I'm not sure whether the situation with LISAs would be significantly different). Apologies if this seems somewhat garbled, but any advice about this would be very helpful.

This may turn out to be a pretty longwinded post, so thanks in advance for reading!

Currently I'm in the process of setting up various high-interest current accounts to move my cash savings to from their current home in a savings account with trivial interest. The accounts I'm at various stages of opening are: TSB Classic Plus, Nationwide Flexdirect, Club Lloyds, Bank of Scotland with Vantage and Tesco Current Account (x2). 
This will leave me with another £3000 in cash which I intend to trickle into some combination of the TSB, Nationwide and Lloyds regular savers (and then continue making payments from the Tesco current accounts). My initial feeling is that it would be best to open all three, make the maximum deposits for as long as I can and then continue to make at least the minimum deposits to ensure that the money is in the accounts (and hence earning interest) for as long as possible.

I also have a £3500 in an old Barclay's cash ISA paying 0.8% interest - is there any reason not to simply withdraw this money and put that towards the regular savers as well? I could, for example, open a second Bank of Scotland account and use that to store it whilst waiting to pay it in.

I then have about £8500 invested in the M&amp;G Managed Growth Fund X Inc - this was done by family members when I was born and I have never subsequently done anything with it. I don't have an incredibly strong grasp on the situation with it, but it seems that it has performed very poorly for at least the past five years or so. Presumably I should do something with this, but the key question is - what? I could presumably withdraw the money and once again keep it in the highest interest current accounts/regular savers I can find (and I think this would generate a better return than the fund has had for the last few years), but I might also be interested in putting it into other funds if I knew where to be looking (presumably inside an ISA?)

Any help or advice would be gratefully appreciated! ",UKPersonalFinance,[Savings][Investments] What to do with old Cash ISA and Fund Investment,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/4lvb5j/savingsinvestments_what_to_do_with_old_cash_isa/

I've been attempting to open a classic account (w/ Vantage) with Bank of Scotland - I compelted the form online, but received a message telling me there had been a technical error (70000001) and that I should try again later. I also had this issue with TSB (they appear to use the same application system) but was able to resolve it on that case by phoning and then going in branch. In this case however I can't find the appropriate BoS phone number - the obvious one I can find (for ""Bank Accounts"") seems to require an account number and sort-code, so isn't applicable, and I can't find a number specifically for applications. 

Does anyone know which number I should call? Or perhaps even what causes this issue? Going in branch isn't really an option as I live in southern England.
