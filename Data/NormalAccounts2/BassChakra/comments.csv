Every time as a kid I was taught a musical instrument, my teacher sucked the life out of it. Scales, chords, classical music - kids hate that. So my passion died and I quit every time. 

But when I picked up the bass as an adult I was determined to do it different. No scales, no chords, no classical music. I started learning basic rock songs right from the beginning and my passion grew &amp; grew. Now I love it enough to care about scales, but has i started there I might have quit early too

31,"True that. Two points though :-
Firstly this is just a simple story to make a point, so we can forgive the timing being off. 
Secondly even economists treat the Money Multiplier as being fairly instantaneous, so again, probably not so bad.  

Ultimately the key to the story is the circularity of debt, where people owe and are owed. In this case it is a single all-encompassing loop. In real life much debt is one way, and circular loops are likely to exist but in a small scale. 

And even IRL when it IS two-way (eg. I deposit money in my bank account; and that same bank lends me money for my mortgage) - the relative scales are very different (my mortgage is much bigger than my deposits :) and terms are different (I basically earn nothing now on my deposits but my mortgage rate is much higher)

All in all, a fun, pathological, story. And a fun discussion.

Seriously though, you may be at risk of messing up your bass playing because of your rush to sing. 

After all, since you're such a beginner, you should be focusing on your playing technique, and not (yet) trying to ignore it. 

Are your fingers relaxed? Hand position good? Neck comfortably supported? Holding the notes the right length of time? Playing with the right fingers? If you are thinking about singing, how will your playing ever get beyond pure beginner? 

Yes you can do as the others suggest, and you will get ok at playing+singing a couple of songs, but I'm not convinced your playing will ever get good.

- Maybe a song like Blurred Lines. Although overall there is complexity, there are some simple parts that repeat often (say from 0:20 to 0:35) - and learn that. Not perfectly, but enough to jam to. 

- Or Avril Lavigne's ""Rock &amp; Roll"" which is just 4 notes played over &amp; over &amp; over again.

- emphasise the bass (not treble) in your music player (even possible in iOS) to make it easier for yourself 
- tap hand/foot in rhythm to bass line, makes the connection more obvious
