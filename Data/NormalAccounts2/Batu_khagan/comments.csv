You are off to a good start. As for learning about what Catholicism is all about, that is the entire purpose of the Nicene Creed. That, more than anything else, is the best primer to Catholic dogma.

I tend to find that homilies these days are worse than useless for learning anything, but everything else--that is, the Mass itself--is rife with meaning. Study what each line refers to, and be sure to find a text copy of the *whole* Mass, because there will be included prayers that the priest says quietly to himself.",2016-11-03 20:30:57+00:00,d9khyk2,1.0,t3_5awnmy,25813.0,Catholicism

15,"&gt;So did the Jewish religion come before Roman Catholicism?

Yes, in a broad sense. One thing that distinguishes modern (Orthodox) Judaism from the religion in Jesus's time is the priestly caste and the practice of animal sacrifice. Judaism today has neither priests nor sacrifice, but their scriptures (the Old Testament) make reference to both.

Early Christianity was almost indistinguishable from Judaism; the major difference that split them then, up until now, was whether Jesus is the Messiah. The initial spread of Christianity was within Judea and among the Jews in the Diaspora.

&gt;Jesus was a Jew, correct?

Yes, and as a descendant of King David, of the finest Jewish stock.",2016-10-26 00:10:16+00:00,d97ss4t,5.0,t1_d97l2rk,10753.0,Catholicism

What is the Deuterocanon? It's sort of like a ""middle"" Testament. When the Jewish scriptures were first translated into Greek, the result was called the Septuagint. This compilation is a combination of the Old Testament and the Deuterocanon. The Old Testament is what was retained in Judaism as their scripture, whereas the Deuterocanon is the books they left out. 

As for the King James, it is a translation of the Bible. It is not the official Catholic translation into English; that would be the Douay-Rheims.",2016-10-25 19:56:14+00:00,d97hddp,3.0,t1_d97gda9,1199.0,Catholicism

It doesn't have to be in the Jungle (that's just where it first appears) but it's recommended not to do it in the Corruption/Crimson. Read more at http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide:Chlorophyte_Ore_Farming . I have some relevant info in italics below.

*Pre-1.3 the underground short-range maximum is 12 ore blocks in a 114 tile range (114x114 or an area of 12,996 tiles) and the long-range max is 56 ore blocks in a 284 tile range (284x284 or an area of 20,449 tiles).
    Pre-1.3 the cavern short-range maximum is 24 ore blocks in a 76 tile range (76x76 or an area of 5,776 tiles) and the long-range max is approximately 111 ore blocks in a 190 tile range (190x190 or an area of 36,100 tiles).* 

As for armor, I typically skip Chlorophyte armor and save my ore for the post-Plantera armor of my choice (Spectre for mages, Beetle for melee (which requires Turtle as a materials) or Shroomite for rangers. Shroomite is the easiest to make and Beetle is the hardest).",2015-12-06 22:47:55+00:00,cxpl7x6,1.0,t3_3vpmhh,2343.0,Terraria
