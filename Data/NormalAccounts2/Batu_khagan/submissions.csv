&gt;The first was when I was 18 years old. She was 19, half-Indian (feather, not dot) and half-black and was raised on a reservation. She considered herself an Indian and referred to blacks as ""them"" and ""they"" and looked down on them.

&gt;Not surprisingly she only slept with white guys. I have no idea what happened to her but figured at the very least she had a child by a white man.

&gt;Also not surprisingly she hit on me. I knew the reason why: blond hair and blue eyes.

&gt;Everyone wants lighter kids.

&gt;The second one was half-black and half-white and really was high-yellow. She also only slept with white guys and had a child by one, whom I once met and who had blue eyes (she also made more than one comment about my blue eyes).

&gt;Her little girl was white. In two generations the family went from black to white.

&gt;People talk about things such as ""yellow fever but I've never heard anyone talk about ""white fever"" except for those no-class blacks who go crazy around white meat, although they never use the term ""white fever."" I mean non-white or part-white women who only desire white guys. They do exist.

&gt;I once encountered a black woman who basically told me, ""If I have a kid by a black man the child will be black. Why should I do that when I can have a kid by a white man?""

&gt;In college I first met a black woman who only slept with white guys (she also hit on me).

&gt;I figure no one really wants to be black and if they can't they can at least they can lighten their kids.

&gt;Some people think sooner or later we'll all be mixed and turn into a mocha mess. That's never going to happen.

&gt;**White men are the most desired and Asian men and black women the least. I had an Asian woman tell me she couldn't imagine an Asian man and a black woman together.** White people are of the same opinion.

&gt;In college I worked with a guy who married a beautiful Chinese woman raised in the U.S. (I met her and she clearly found me amusing). The father was opposed to the union, which made me laugh. I thought, you should be grateful the kids will be half-white, which means in the long-run putting an end to short, weak, scrawny no-dick Asian NOWAG nerds.

&gt;As for male half-breeds they look to be just a huge mess. Even Hillary Clinton said Barak Obama was lazy and shiftless.

&gt;Colin Kaepernick? What a joke (I know a woman with a white father and a Filipina mother who mocked Kaepernick as a ""half-breed"").

&gt;**Miscegenation used to be illegal. I know why. The children belong nowhere, at least the men.**

&gt;There doesn't appear to be much of a problem with mixed-breed women. But with mixed-breed men - a huge problem. The women can be absorbed into white culture and the white race but the men belong nowhere and will never be accepted.

&gt;The problem is worst when it comes to half-white and half-Asian men. They're still NOWAG (No One Wants Asian Guys). The women will be absorbed but the men won't.

&gt;I actually met the half-Indian and half-black woman when I was living in Santa Barbara and working in Isla Vista, just like Elliot Rodger, the NOWAG half-breed who went insane from lack of meaning, importance and community in his life and so slaughtered several people, starting with a couple of NOWAG Asian nerds, whom he dispatched hands-on with a knife. That's a lot of half-breed self-hate.

My attempts at securing better employment have all been duds, and I actually cussed out the recruiter I was talking to despite being more helpful than the others I've had the misfortune of interacting with.

* (Over) three years ago, my short relationship with my gf was on the rocks. I took her with me to my annual trip to my parents' house for Christmas. She didn't appreciate that I kept relaying the criticisms Mom had of her. She also kept her nice Orange County townhome disgustingly filthy, which I took pictures of secretively in order to show Mom. At the last moment I hesitated, and deleted the photos. I ended the relationship a month later. Despite her faults, I seriously considered proposing, and my feeble attempts to remain friends didn't work. My dating life has gone nowhere since then.

* The moral is that as bad as I thought I had things back then, they are worse now. Well... maybe not so bad--my condo was remodeled and I have a nice 2br place all to myself.

All you need is a tiny house for the Nurse such that you can talk to her without entering and a long asphalt skybridge. Have as many speed buffs as possible and a homing weapon of some sort (I used Razorblade Typhoon and the Nebula weapons). 

Basically, attack, kite the bastard and run to the Nurse when things get grim. WARNING: If you run away too fast,  he will teleport. So, you need to be fast but keep him within screen range.
