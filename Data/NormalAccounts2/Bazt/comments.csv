9,That scene where Jaime killed Aerys and sat down on the throne for himself is nothing but foreshadowing. He will kill Cersei early next season and take the throne for himself and lead the fight during the siege of King's Landing to come. ,2016-06-27 05:28:09+00:00,d4pilgb,1,t3_4q0yeg,12320,gameofthrones
10,"Best battle scene ever. Battles are rarely fighting with honour and glory, but more like a slaughter which the show did an amazing job at perpetrating. 

However, i do wonder about the 8 meter stacked bodies the surrounded them, who did all the stacking when the fighting was happening? The movie 300 showed us that stacking a pile of bodies that high took a day while these bodies got stacked in 8 minutes. That was the only problem i had with the battle other then that it was perfect.",2016-06-20 10:58:46+00:00,d4ghpzm,1,t3_4owdkh,32156,gameofthrones

12,"Yup. Ramsay could have showed up butt naked to the battle and still be able to take down Wun-wun only using his fists (plot armor op).

But on a serious note, they are both in charge of thousands of combat experienced men. There is bound to be a smith somewhere amongst them and some useful resources to craft. Would have been a nice feeling to see them in some real nice plate armor instead of the same leather stuff they always wear. ",2016-06-15 23:58:30+00:00,d4axajs,2,t1_d4ax6kq,172,gameofthrones

14,"Like someone said earlier, i think that the tower of joy will be a tease. After the fight the remaining men are gonna go up in the tower and both of them will hear a baby crying and then the vision ends there and we get plot blocked for 2-3 more episodes. It's one of the biggest mystery in the game of thrones universe overall and i doubt they are gonna throw it all on this upcoming episode but rather draw it out a little longer.
