Personally, I think that it will be Nate Diaz vs Conor. Dana knows that the view counts and sold out tickets exploded when Conor vs Nate diaz fought. And both of the fights, especially the last one was one of the best fights in UFC to date. 

It stands 1-1 and UFC cares about viewers and sold out tickets, so they know if they make it Nate Diaz Vs Conor in titlebeltfight it will be the most viewed live fight in the history.

In the upcoming Assassin's Creed game, we get to play as Ezio Auditore. And you might ask, but how? Well let me tell ya

The game starts off in Firenze 1524 couple days before his death. We get to play as Ezio and just reveal nostalgia moments and do some mini missions with his family. Then one day we get a mission to go to the local market with his family, which is where he sits on the bench and meets the young man. The proceed to talk with eachother and Ezio gets a heart attack.

The camera starts to zoom into his eyes (Like Gandfal in the Lord of The ring) and Ezio wakes up in this digital room with Juno and Isu. They proceed to talk with Ezio of how death is not finished with him and he must return back to earth but thousands of years earlier (the egypt days)

Ezio wonders why but he gets no real answers, Juno and Isu proceeds to turn him young before sending him off. He then travels through space and time (Like gandalf in lord of the ring) and then wakes up in a haybarn in Egypt, Alexandria, and there the real game starts.


The game's real breakout success started with Ezio. All the other main characters in the AC game are boring, non relatable and lazy writing af.  The game should end with the best AC character of them all, Ezio.

I personally think that it would be a great investment and there is alot of possibilities to make a great strategy game based of LoTR but then ofcourse they need to play their cards right. Please discuss what you think about this theoretically.

If they ever did this then they need to learn from their mistake on Total War Rome 2 and not rush things. Sega needs to stop forcing CA to do early releases on games who haven't been fully polished (Rome 2 was released 8 months earlier then Creative Assembly wanted to)

Also here is a very well done trailer on a fan made mod released earlier this year featuring Lord of The Ring in Total war. Just a glimpse of what could have been.

It's been 6 fucking years god damnit, where is Red Dead Redemption 2? Any news? The first red dead redemption got so many awards and it sold like butter. Everyone loved the game so i'm wondering, why haven't we heard anything from RDR2 yet? Will we ever get a RDR 2 ?",reddeadredemption,Read Dead Redemption 2,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/4e1507/read_dead_redemption_2/

How you played as Ezio and then you saw your whole family get hanged. Man you got so angry and you really felt like you were a part of the game. You just wanted to kill everyone who was responsible for your families murder. Ezio and the characters felt so alive and detailed that you really got a big connection with them just in a matter of minutes. AC2 was revolutionary in all sorts of aspects.

And then Brotherhood. The borga questlines and Rome city was just so great. They really made you hate the Borgia family. I loved exploring every little thing in that city. But then suddenly the franchise went downhill. The last good and decent assassin's creed game was Black flag and it hurts my heart to say it. How it went from one of the best game franchise to just a milking project so ubisoft can make the most money.

If Ubisoft really want to deliver this year then their next game AC game that Ubisoft does should take place in Ancient Egypt. Imagine the possibilites. Pharaoh storylines, amazing nextgen graphic. Tomb plundring in pyramids. The Nile. Maybe some Moses Questlines aswell. Camel riding. Slave liberations. Beautiful desert landscapes and beautiful and rich cities full with suprises and interesting civilians. I think Ubisoft need to take the Assassin's Creed franchise back to it's core foundation and i think they could really succeed if they went to ancient egypt. Let me know how you feel about it.

When i was a noob i played on titan and i thought it was the hardest thing ever, because i wasen't aware of that you can block so i was literally just rolling around the whole game to dodge attacks. It dosen't make sense that you should be able to block 80% of the enemies and boss attacks (hades whips, zeus,etc)
