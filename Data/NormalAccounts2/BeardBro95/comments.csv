0,"Thanks, I've tried ACHD at 1080p 25fps, and tbh my laptop seems to be a bit juddery and struggles with it in Hitfilm 4, lol. 720p mp4 at 25fps seem ok though :p It just means I have to wait a little bit longer when post processing with AVCHD.

I've offered my service to a small school to photograph some images for their own use. I'm photographing some facilities of the school and, well, general school activity.

I have a Lumix G6, 20mm f1.7, 60mm f2.8 and use my kit lens at the wide end for 14mm f3.5 (bare in mind x2 crop due to MFT sensor). I'm comfortable using manual mode, and edit with RAWtherapee. I also have an external manual flash and monopod and tripod if need be.

What I'm really asking for here is; ideas/advice/tips on composition or what sort of photos to get, if anyone has any advice. I often offer myself to photograph local, small community activities, but this makes me nervous lol. I'll be visiting the school a week in advance.

Even my little G6, is an awesome quality camera for video, so I have no doubt the G7 will be even better.

I'm thinking, of getting the EM5 MKii because a majority of the stuff I video will be going on social media and YouTube, 

The IBIS and battery grip will be a huge help. 

But, I'm still tossing between the EM5 MKii and G7, I probably won't be investing until around December/February time so I have time to think (and wait for prices to drop). :)

I checked out some sample footage on YouTube and it looks good enough, but agree, not up to the level of G7.

The best thing you can do is practise your technique when taking photos at slow shutter speeds (of course, with things like a telephoto lens that's a bit different), that's what I've been trying to do.

The other thing I did to help me is to invest in a good monopod, I got myself a cheapy photo-r monopod for like £8 from Amazon, and it works a treat at slower shutter speeds.

Some monopods have clips to adjust the height, others have a wheel you turn. With my model, sometimes when I'm working fast it can be a little cumbersome if I don't open a clip fully and wonder why it's not extending or collapsing lol. Also depending on it's position I may not reach the clip correctly quick enough, with a wheel it's a wee bit quicker.

The other thing is the lack of a ball head can make things really awkward depending on the location and space, I would really consider getting a sturdy enough ball head, in some tight places it just was not possible to comfortably get the right angles. 

If I did get them, I would have to mess around with the height which took time.

Funnily enough, I was talking about marriage with my mum this evening. One thing I have learnt is that parents and their children need to meet halfway on this matter, it is important both discuss is openly. 

Like this evening, despite my mum wanting me married off soon, she still said she doesn't think I'm ready yet. I agree with her, that's why we talk about these things so we know what to expect from each other. 

Marriage is a fact of life, it will happen. Especially for us Muslims, I think, sadly, that many of the elders forget the true benefit and meaning of marriage in Islam. 

The best advice I would give my seventeen year old self, is to focus your time on increasing your knowlege of Islam, spending time with the Qur'an, and working on improving oneself. If you can work on your deen from a young age, all the niqabi sisters will be after you when your time comes little man :) ",2016-07-12 23:10:58+00:00,d59vfir,2.0,t1_d59jrw1,15688.0,MuslimNoFap

357,"I have the G6 but I plan to get the G7 after investing in some lenses.

When I watched DRs video about micro four thirds being dead I was going to switch over to fuji. It wasn't really sensor size that was bothering me but rather the output, I just wanted better high ISO performance and colours. 

When I compared the G7/GX8 to the Fuji XT10 I was surprised to see how much the MFT sensors improved so I decided to stick with MFT considering I've already invested in it and do a lot of video.

To be honest, I care about sensor size less than ever now, I really think it's a rat race. I'm paying more attention to sensor technology which is what I think is most important now. For some it will be different, the only reason I can see the need for something like full frame now is for the... bokeh? Idk.

But yeah, I don't find myself envying larger sensors, even newer sensors not that much. I just have to be more careful with my settings in camera and spend some time editing images :)

362,"Assalamu Alaikum

1) All praise and thanks is to Allah who has helped you realise what you were doing was wrong- many people are often in denial, and most boys your age (even Muslims boys, sadly) try to justify what they are doing.

2) I often found myself falling into laziness. It is said that an idle mind is the devil's playground. Keep ypurself busy with things like reading (authenic Islamic books, tafsir, etc), writing (I keep a journal to record my thoughts) or sports. 

3) Big mistake I made: I let my sins control my life. Your sins do not define you. Allah with his mercy has concealed your sins. At one point I thought I was so sinful that my Du'a would not be accepted, audhubillah. Shaytaan will try to mess you around, as default you are a believer and the good deeds replace the bad deeds, if you find yourself falling into sin then follow it up with a good deed. Start your hifz, In Shaa Allah, and from there strive to be the best you can.

372,"Hello everyone, I'm new to reddit and have found this awesome photography subreddit.

I have a Panasonic Lumix G6 and I find myself often volunteering for community/charity events for photo/video purposes. So far I have been using my trusty 20mm F1.7 MKII (40mm equivalent) but I'm intending to expand my kit. A lot of my shots are becoming boring or I can't get the shots I want with just this one lens.

For a wider focal length I'm going for the Samyang 12mm (24mm equivalent), but being on a budget I can't decide between the Olympus 45mm f1.8 (90mm equivalent) or the Sigma 60mm f2.8 (120mm equivalent). I understand that both lenses would ideally compliment each other but I'm on a budget.

Here are my thoughts for each one:
Olympus 45mm:
-F1.8 aperture 
-90mm might be more usable indoors? 
-Better manual focus barrel (texture)

Sigma 60mm:
-Cheaper 
-Very sharp 
-Longer reach will help with getting more candid shots (But will it be too long and cumbersome indoors?)

Anyone with experience with this sort of stuff or these lenses?
Many thanks in advance fellow 'togs.

I fell in love again with M43 when I realised how great its lens lineup is, how diverse the system is and how I can get great photos and video from it when I know what I'm doing and edit properly! I use a Lumix G6 at the moment and 20mm f1.7 MKII.

Personally, I like the extra depth of field, especially when filming. For me this is an advantage as I like the context in the background.

As for noise it's true this has been a problem at higher ISO but I think sensor technology has really advanced. I compared the G7 to some fuji cameras and I was very impressed, which is why I'm next getting the G7 (after investing in some lenses).
