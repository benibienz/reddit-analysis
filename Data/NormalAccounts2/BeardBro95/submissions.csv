I just felt sad knowing the sister I used to really like that got married off is now expecting a child, it shouldn't effect me and part of purity of the heart is to wish well for people and ask Allah to bless them. Everyone around me is getting married, felt like a uselss irrelevant turd.Re-posting this piece I wrote at a reminder to myself and to perhaps benefit any new comers to the sub. 




""This is another niggling thought from the Shayateen that crept into my head no longer then say perhaps six minutes ago. This is a foolish thought for myself to have, the trigger being I stumbled upon a picture a friend my age posted on a social network of him and his new wife enjoying a meal out in a fancy place. 


I instantly felt as if I lack much blessing in my life, and that I am lagging behind everyone else, I begin to wonder what it is everyone else is doing right that I seem to be getting wrong unknowingly and perpetually. 

Well, first of all, we are all blessed in different ways and Allah is the almighty and merciful and all knowing, so to question his dispense of apparent blessings is not for us short sighted children of Adam to do so.

Secondly, we are very blessed by Allah in many ways in which we don’t even realise, some we will not come to recognise for a lifetime or not until they are taken away from us. Allah makes mention of this in the Qur’an: “It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky and produced thereby some fruits as provision for you and subjected for you the ships to sail through the sea by His command and subjected for you the rivers. And He subjected for you the sun and the moon, continuous [in orbit], and subjected for you the night and the day. And He gave you from all you asked of Him. And if you should count the favor of Allah , you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful.” [14:32-34].

Thirdly, this thought is foolish, if, one was to see little barakah in their life, it would be their own fault for abandoning the Qur’an and increasing in sin over good deeds and leaving Taubah! In Musnad Ahmad it is narrated that Thawbaan said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘A man is deprived of provision because of the sins that he commits.’” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4022, classed as hasan/sound by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah). 
Tafseer Al-Qurtubi states:
A man complained to Al-Hasan about a drought, and he said to him: “Pray to Allah for forgiveness.”
Another man complained to him of poverty and he said to him: “Pray to Allah to forgive you.”
Another man said to him: “Pray to Allah to bless me with a child.” He said: “Pray to Allah for forgiveness.”
Another complained to him that his garden was dry. He said to him: “Pray to Allah for forgiveness.”
 He was asked about it and he said: “This is not my personal opinion, for Allah says in Surah Nooh (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance. And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.” Tafseer Al-Qurtubi (18/301-302).

Fourthly, sometimes what we perceive to be a blessing given to someone by Allah may in turn be a form of misery for them in some case, such that they may have a nice car, and it breaks down frequently, or someone has a beautiful wife but she is not modest, or one who has a big house is unable to sleep in it peacefully at night due to his worries of debt.
Fifthly, Allah is the most merciful and sustenance comes from Him alone, so one may be ruining their relation with Allah by thinking bad in that they are being deprived by Allah. Jâbir b. `Abd Allah al-Ansârî relates that he heard Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said three days before his death: ""None of you should ever die except while assuming the best about Allah."" [Sahîh Muslim (5125)]""

24mm eqv field of view
Very wide, can make nice dramatic effects
Good for small rooms
Can crop if need be

I was exposed to P by a school mate many years ago at the beginning of high school, I'm now nearly done with University. It began with disbelief, then amazement, then curiosity kept bringing me back. Long story short, as I grew older I encountered a lot of problems in life from many different angles, mostly financial, and emotional/mental wellbeing. 

In my late teens I began to engage in bad PMO binges out of misery, sadness, feelings of uselessness and stress. My number 1 reason to leave PMO (for good) is for the sake of my religiosity which is where I felt the first blow. Alongside that, with PMO habits I can't enjoy anything, walks, family, work, Uni, sleep (big problem), nothing gets done right and my hobbies even feel unenjoyable. 

One of the biggest tipping points into my descent of misery and feeling worthless leading to PMO habits was when this girl I was utterly obsessed with married someone else, I knew there was never a chance of me every marrying her (we don't have pre-marital relations), I firmly accepted that fact many years ago and knew the day would come eventually where I would have to witness it (I was even at the wedding, trying to not to cry, lol. At least I could have said 'I'm crying because I'm happy for them' haha). This is where things got really bad.

If I fall into PMO habits, my mind body and soul feels scrambled. Everything is clouded and dark, I see no way out. 

This year I began to seriously make the intention of leaving, for about a good half a year I couldn't go past 2/4 days. But, this year with the aid of Ramadan and fasting and seclusion, I managed to get past 50+ days.

I actually felt *alive* again, the world was back in sight and I could  breathe, everything opened up. I felt like a child again, in a good way. The world was bright. I felt confident, capable and powerful. 

Then, I *reset*, but I wasn't aware of the difference between reset and relapsing at the time. I fell into PM one evening and thought 'what the heck' and began to binge out of feelings of self pity (something triggered me off). It was terrible, I felt like everytime I fell into PMO habits, I was getting hit in the soul by a bus, and I would take days to recover. 

My mother always brought me up well in the world and when I see her face and I know I do these habits behind close doors I can't live with myself (she's had cancer on numerous occasions and I'm grateful to have her here). 

So far I've made it 6 days and I am aiming for 20 as that seems like a manageable, nicely rounded number. 

Already, I am starting to feel like myself again after 6 days of mindful abstinence. I help battle any sort of withdrawal or negativity by fasting, writing in my journal, going for long walks and practising photography.

Whoever has read this, thanks for your time, I needed to write this out.

Initially, I was totally stoked and hyped for the G80, it seemed like the perfect camera I had been waiting for all this time.

After watching TCSTV's review, I thought something was up with the high ISO image samples, they just didn't seem right to me. After some googling for samples and looking at some samples at ePhotozine the results seemed pretty... disappointing. Even though I know that they were taken in JPEG with NR probably at default settings.

So I ended up on PhotographyBlog (not my go-to site) and checked out the cropped JPEG and RAW files and it looked like the G80 files were much grainier. 

G7: http://www.photographyblog.com/reviews/panasonic_lumix_dmc_g7_review/image_quality/

G80/85:
http://www.photographyblog.com/reviews/panasonic_lumix_dmc_g80_review/image_quality/

So, looking at the two sets of examples, it appears that the G7 files are cleaner with less noise, but less sharpness/detail and more washed out colours. However the G80/85 files seem to be preserving colour and sharpness/detail better at the expense of more noise? 

To be honest, I was a bit bummed out to see the results, no doubt it will be a great camera in many aspects but as of now it's bugging me. The biggest selling point for me was the additional battery grip and weather sealing (yup that's right, even before the IBIS lol). 

I'd be happy with the softer-ish files of the G7 and brushing is up in post, it's better performance than my G6 so I might just take advantage of any G7 price drops.

Thoughts on the matter? Perhaps it doesn't bother you, or maybe I'm just being a lazy photographer not wanting to do any decent post production? Maybe I'm expecting too much or making a mountain out of a molehill. 

Guess we'll have to wait until more people get their hands on it to find out more!

Since having sat myself down after a very stressful period and making a firm resolution to start over again, I'm feeling much better and 'clearer' in head and heart after five days (I'm using the app rewire to keep track), but I know there is still a long way to go. 

Alhamdulillah I'm happy because I was getting down to some root causes, I've been doing very well to avoid P at all costs, but I found the reason I was falling into M was from stress, anxiety, beating myself up and feelings of hopelessness. Lots of things were causing me stress and they were deep rooted from other experiences and problems. 

The past few two days or so were incredibly stressful and everything was going wrong with work, Uni, Finances and other external plans. On top of all that, the day everything was at its peak of going wrong I found out that another sister I used to quite like is now married, I always end up comparing myself with where I am in life and feel useless and like loser. 

Above all that, I was able to hold out from any PMO habits which has paid off. I remembered the post from the original NoFap along the lines of something like 'I don't know what lies ahead at 'x' amount of days, but I do know what it's like to be at day 0 and I don't want to go back there again'. We all know what it feels like to be in PMO habits, and the days ahead abstaining only hold something better. 

I enjoyed going to the park today with my camera and mother and just took in the environment, unplugging myself. I'm making this a case of a strong mental battle, and improving my religiosity. With PMO habits I can't enjoy *anything*, my mind, body and soul is perpetually fried and frazzled. Head heavy and cloudy. 

I've been at the 50+ day mark and I don't know what it's going to be like getting there again outside or Ramadan or how I'll feel at 50 days from now, but I'm sure it'll be better than anything else I've been experiencing recently.  

The new lease of life when you quite PMO is amazing no doubt, but I have to keep reminding myself this is primarily for the sake of Deen and Allah, that's the reason we've all started this journey. 

Physically speaking, I'm not feeling any more cramps or aches down below after 5 days of abstaining. 

The rewire app is pretty good, minimalistic design and simple to use. It gives a period of 21 days to quit/make a habit by default 

Will hope to update in a weeks time In shaa Allah.

I found myself on some days going through a lot of anxiety until the end of the day to see whether or not I'll 'crack' and give in to PMO habits, 

That ended up making me think about it more. So, to fight that, every morning I wake up alive and well Alhamdulillah, I tell myself 'today I have done no PMO habits.' Yes, at the beginning of the morning I say 'I have not *done*'. 

That way, I face the day with a feeling of positivity and it keeps my mind at bay from overthinking about not falling into PMO habits which can equally distract me and make me anxious or feel upset.

Sadly I've not been very active at all here between work and starting Uni again. It's been quite a sad time for me and I haven't been myself. 

All of my problems started up again from a lack of tawwakul, I was under a lot of stress with money, housing, my university application and student finance was messed up and caused me a lot of trouble, I fel into M habits really badly. On top of all that stress, something really silly happened to me on top of it all. I saw the sister I used to like around my work area who married some other guy I know, it triggered something off in my head and I just went as low as I possibly could thinking about how useless and worthless I am. 

Very sad such a good streak was broken, but after 50 days or so I began to see a new path and light. I felt like myself again then. I am determined to get past 50 days again. 

I feel like I'm in utter darkness and misery with any PMO habits, it feels like my head is scrambled after anything PMO related, seriously. My head and soul hurt for days afterwards, I can't concentrate or think properly, my spiritual state feels in pain too. 

when I was younger, I was always praised for my insight, patience and understanding, but with PMO habits none of those qualities lie with me anymore. 

I am determined to quit this for good, and with this I feel a bit of rejuvenation. 


Finding more reasons to quit: 

-I breed chickens as a hobby, the other day a plank of wood fell and hit of my baby chicks trapping him underneath. I caught him just in time and he was suffocating and squished, he looked so sad and scared. We managed to save him and nurture him back to health and Alhamdulillah he's as good as new. When I saw how scared my little chick looked and him in pain, I decided I really want to quite any PMO habits for the sake of Allah because he saved my little chick. I love my chickens. 


-For the sake of Islam anyway, the fact I am Muslim and ALlah has given me life will always be the number one reason. 


-Sake of any future children. We want the best for our children and we want to be the best example. If Allah ever grants me children I want to be well away from all of this stuff to set the example and not be a hypocrite. 


-To appreciate the blessing of my eyesight. Allah can take it away at any time. 


-To concentrate better on my Islamic and Uni studies


-To further seek out the sense of clarity I once felt in my 50 day streak, the feeling I forgot, the feeling I never thought would come back. 


I feel a bit broken and need time to straighten out my head and thoughts, hopefully I'll be active in here. ",MuslimNoFap,"I'm still here, update. Misery, Sadness, new turn.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNoFap/comments/54jug2/im_still_here_update_misery_sadness_new_turn/

I currently don't own a telephoto lens, and at times I could really do with one. So far, in small halls and venues, the 14mm end on my kit lens and my 20mm have done quite well/ok-ish for small charity events. 

Being a student I'm on a budget and I can't splash out on multiple telephoto leses which would be ideal. 

I'm thinking of the Sigma 60mm f2.8, it'll be handy in smaller venues (what about larger ones???) and is super sharp. I was thinking of the sigma because it's quite affordable and the sharpness would make cropping in great. 

If not that, the meike 50mm f2 (no, seriously), because it's so damn cheap and its centre sharpness isn't actually all that bad. 

The Panasonic 45-200 would be ideal with OIS is ideal with a great zoom range and it's stabilisation but it's price is a bit out of my range. 

Could I make do with the Sigma and just crop in? 

I use a Lumix G6.

Edit: 

I actually wrote this in mind with a few upcoming events where I will be photographing some speakers on a stage in a large hall, alongside that i'll generally be the same thing (speakers), but in smaller venues

Bismillah,

First of all I want to apologise for not being active here in a long time, I've just been so busy with work. I had a few posts in mind for a few weeks now but couldn't find the time to write them. (edit, I started writing this on Thursday, closed my laptop to do something else... finishing this off on Sunday lol. Yup, very busy these days grinding for cash lol). 

I've really been struggling in work due to a lot of the young, and bluntly put, beautiful staff who work there also. The fact I'm popular with all members of staff, does not help. I have a reputation of being approachable and funny with a good charisma, great to have that known by the managers but not the girls on the shopfloor lol :) 

One girl in particular, is paying a lot of attention to me lately. Yikes. Trying to walk with me to the shops on my break, talking  to me a lot, asking me if I think they're fat (yes, really) and I even woke up to a friend request from them on facebook today, double yikes lol. 


This is a huge test for me and at times I feel myself crumbling but I have to pull myself together, the feeling of struggle for Allah's sake is much more enjoyable and satisfying and joyous. I'm trying to not give myself any excuses to fall into M, so that I 'relieve' myself, I just don't want that. It's a gateway to binging.  


Okay, so that's my update. Story time now. I was originally going to call this post, 'yes, you can change'. It's not about where you came from, it's about where you're going. Never lose hope and faith in Allah about the future, this is incredibly damaging and has long lasting negative effects. I fell into this trap and it damaged me for the best part of 2/3 years badly.


What I'm telling you now is a true story, I know a Muslim family of three brothers. One of which I used to know in school, and due to his behaviour and company, I never once thought he could possibly be Muslim (or that I would ever keep company with him, which I do now). 

These three brothers, for the most part of their life, weren't close to religion. They would imitate non-Muslim habits of men (piercings etc), drink alcohol, go clubbing, have girlfriends and generally, lead an unislamic lifestyle. 

Two of the brothers had non-Muslim girlfriends, the youngest did not but would freemix and drink and go clubbing. Gradually, and I don't know how, the oldest brother began to go through a slow change. His mind began to gradually wake up to Islam. Slowly his habits began to change. His girlfriend, who he lived with, saw the change in him and was curious as to what was happening after they had been together for a long time. 


So, from this, he began to explain Islam in more detail to her, the missing link from his life. With time, she began to read the Qur'an herself, read surah kahf in English on a friday (yes, I'm serious), every frdiday, kick him to the masjid and encourage him to go to Jumm'ah on time when she wasn't even Muslim (yet). 

In due course, from his actions and sincerity, his girlfriend began to attend gatherings of sisters in the Masjid where she met my mother. There was a gradual friendship between the two and the young woman grew fond of my mother's company.  Eventually, she took her shadah, and she and her previous boyfriend now turned practising, got married in the Masjid witha  very low cost, but the whole family, both sides were so happy. 

Now, that brother has become very well respected in the community, he made taubah, changed his ways and now he is studying Qur'an, attends classes regularly, learns Arabic, and has a very successful trade. His wife fully covers, loves Islam sincerely from the heart and attends the masjid and lots of islamic circles. 

Same thing happened with the second brother, his wife took shahada and now loves Islam, the brother is in a good job after struggling and both of them have gone to hajj twice now. The eldset brother has also been to hajj. 

The yougest brother, turned right the way around. I hadn't seen him for years since he went to University. I was going to Jumm'ah one dau and because I walked due to having no car available I was a bit later than usual meaning I had to find a space in the back. To my shock, the youngest of the three brothers was sat in the back of the Masjid reading a translation of the Qur'an. After that, I saw him more regularly and he began to attend the same circles and halaqa. Eventually, he himself ended up married to a very respectable sister and found himself in a good job.


My brothers and sisters, please do not ever allow yourself to give up fighting no matter how painful it is. That's what I did at one point, I gave up. I stopped fighting. Succumbed to the pain of it all. I thought I was in pain fighting it all, but looking back I realise I was experincing a joy you can't find anywhere else, there is no joy like struggling for Allah's sake.


Make your goals to draw closer to Allah and love Allah, this will be the greatst help in defeating PMO habits. Make a set goal with Qur'an daily, focus on improving your Salaat. Realise that, Yusuf Alayhi Salam did not succumb to the temptation of women and lusts because his heart was filled with the love of Allah. 

My next day off is Tuesday, In Shaa Allah I'll have some time to write something else then. Sorry for a long/rushed post. 

Stay strong.

Assalamu Alaikum,

I've had little to no time to write anything having started this new job. Alhamdulillah though despite the fact I'm often surrounded by women I'm not feeling 'triggered', if anything I am too busy to ever think about PMO habits now and by the time I'm home I'm catching up with other things in the day with studies, so no time at all to let the mind wander... :) 


Every now and then I think about this sister I nearly married, how we both really liked each other, how we cried when it didn't go through and how she'll probably end up with another man, that'll probably be better than me, and have children and a life with him. This is the only thought (from the Shaytaan), that is trying to make me feel self-pity and lean on PMO habits to avoid the thoughts. 

There is only one thing I can do to get over this hurdle that has been bothering me for years: Simply get on with life. 


That's it. 


Remembering it wasn't in my decree and understanding Allah is the best of planners is all that will help, nothing else will. As much as it is a big hole in my heart an even bigger whole will be being distant from Allah and disobeying him. This is the only thing that pulls me back together.

In a previous post, I mentioned I'm a photographer and that is one reason I do not want to disobey Allah with my eyes because it's something I love and PMO is something hated by Allah.  I've recently started to get into air rifling at ranges, which also requires your eyes too heh :) So they are two things I love and don't want to use my eyes for bad anymore. That's one thing that keeps me away from PMO thoughts and habits. 


I have a few other posts in mind and In Shaa Allah as I go through this journey I'll have more. I used to post ever other day or so now but it may go down to once a week with work now.

I'm thinking G7 as number one choice (or even the GX8 as second choice), due to its price and improved image quality,

But thought about a GH3 with grip for the build and battery life. Just annoying knowing it has no peaking even though it can easily be put in with a firmware update!

Of course, the GH3 will be more expensive with a grip, but the G7 handling isn't bad at all and has improved image quality.

Any thoughts and input?

Assalamu Alaikum,

For the past two years I've been keeping a handwritten journal but sometimes I will type things up on my computer depending on how I feel or what it is I'm writing. 

In my journal, I wrote thoughts, goals, plans, Islamic reminders, worries and fears (and then I'll consult them), I search deeper into myself and see what I need to improve within me. Since keeping a journal I understand myself and my thoughts more than ever and it has really transformed me as a person. 

Also, when I write frequently by hand, especially early in the morning, my mind feels much more alert and awake and I don't fee so lethargic. Keeping a journal has also been an excellent way for me to disperse any negative or depressing thoughts, when I'm having a down point I'll write how I honestly feel in my journal, and then I'll console myself by following it up with the Islamic remedy/reminder. When I look back on the previous entries, I'll find these golden reminders and it really helps me. 

There are more benefits of keeping a journal that I won't list here as there are too many. 

Writing in this subreddit, is also a form of journaling for me and I often expand upon previous handwritten entries. 

Personally, I do like to spend money on a good pen and journal (About £30 for my journal and pen together, lol) as for me, writing is an experience I like to enjoy. But it doesn't have to be anything fancy, a notebook and pencil lying around will do :) 

My advice for keeping a journal:

-Try and commit to it, stick to it regularly and find a time that suites you best, although the morning times has a lot of benefit for mental health when writing 'morning pages' (goals, plans for the day, positive reflections etc).


-If you do miss a day, don't beat yourself up over it. 


-Make your journal something beneficial, write down reminders of Ayaat and Hadith, reflections, golden advice from Islamic lectures etc... make it your own treasure chest of wisdom and knowledge. 


-I've never been worried about people reading it when I have it lying around, when I'm writing in it I don't make it secretive. I just leave my *expensive* journal lying around and people don't think twice that there'd be anything interesting in it lol :) 


Keeping a joural helps me stay on top of my mind and my mental state battling with PMO, it'd be interesting to see if anyone else here tries it. If you do, let me know how it goes :)

Assalamu Alaikum,

I am constantly looking for more and more reasons to fuel my determination to leave PMO habits. One time I had to leave a job due to my PMO habits; it was catering, close to home, good pay and good hours. The only problem was it was evening work and catering is not my natural forte of work, on top of that I was always tired and lethargic, I would often make a lot of mistakes. Considering I was not doing a very good job but I was still being paid, I decided to leave as I did not feel it was right for me to be taking that money if I wasn't giving a good level of service to the employers.

Alhamdulillah after that I got working a retail store's warehouse and shop floor. I was good at my job, workers and customers liked me, managers praised me and my store knowledge and customer skills excelled past peers. My contract finished but Alhamdulillah this week the same company called me back for a few months. 

All seems well and good, there's something I've been meaning to write here, but I never got around to it yet. 

I become very depressed, and sad whenever I see a beautiful Muslim woman. That's weird, isn't it? And by look, I don't mean *look*, I mean even if I just have an accidental glance. How weird is this right? I just spiral into misery and negative thoughts about myself, I'm not sure if I'm mentally damaged or what lol. I mean, with myself, this happens with any woman but I always try my best to look away which Alhamdulillah I find easier to do than ever. 

The shop I work in is in area with a very high density of Muslim people, meaning a lot of Muslim women enter. Where does this all link in?

All these stems from the idea and thought that I'd never have a beautiful wife, and the when I began to fall into a cycle of PMO habits in my teen years, I was even more convinced it would never happen etc etc... Of course since then I have become more independent and I am starting to enjoy my own company, my own thoughts, learning to be grateful for what I have around and learning to live and learn for myself first and try to develop as a Muslim man. 

At work today, I was doing pretty well to block out all negative thoughts- that was until someone in the warehouse started to blast some old lovey-dovey-heart-break punk songs from when I was younger lol, but Alhamdulillah even then I wasn't very phased and fought it back. 

I'm looking at this as a challenge and an opportunity to strengthen myself.  I fell into PMO habits from feelings of self-worthlessness and self-pity, I used to fee worthless and useless. I used to be an edgy and emotional teen. 


Another challenge I'm facing is trying to forget about the sisters I was nearly married/engaged too previously because with some of them, I truly feel as if I had a genuine desire to be with them for friendship and companionship. It's even more sad for me when the sister wanted it too, but I pray Allah grants them someone better than me. I'm glad never ever went through because I think a lot of these sisters deserved someone better anyway. When I remember one of them, or is something triggers me off, even if it's a fleeting memory, I just feel very depressed a weak for like an hour or so.


Truth be told, I am enjoying my struggles more than ever now, and they are giving me life. I feel alive whilst fighting them.

This tip may not be suitable for everyone as it may affect someone's health negatively, but recently, I've been doing this simple trick:

having a cold shower. 

That's it. Instead of having a hot shower and encouraging me to stay in there longer when temptation may be strong, just wash yourself, and get out. Simple. Not only that, after very hot showers I often feel very tired and lathergic which can make me lazy and lougne around which means my mind isn't occupied wichi can lead to lingering thoughts.

Some benefits I feel from cold/luke warm showers:

-Feel energetic, revived,and fresh


-Don't feel tired 


-Weakens PMO urges


-Trains my endurance/mental capacity


-Feel positive, don't feel groggy.

First of all I would like say I feel bad not being able to spend enough time on this subreddit reading and writing, I really do have a lot I would like to share with you guys. Secondly, as much as I don't comment much, I do appreciate everyone's efforts here. We all need to work together. 

In an attempt to dowse my PMO habits, which Alhamdulillah is going a lot easier than I thought, is that I try to find more reasons to quit PMO that motivate me even more. 

Of course, the number one reason is for Allah's sake. But one reason came into my head today and it gave me quite a jolt up my spine to rectify myself. 

Alhamdulillah, my mother is very practising, wise and loving woman. Her piety emanates through her speech and actions. I am the only child she has and she is also a cancer patient. 

One time my mother and I were talking about things and she mentioned how pleased and happy she was that I avoid the filth of the world, which Alhamdulillah she did a good job of securing me from. But then I felt a pang about the PMO habits only I and Allah know of. 

This is one reason that given me so much strength and determination to leave behind filthy PMO habits. I don't want my mother's love and her upbringing of me to be in vain. 

If anything happens to her, and she leaves me whilst I continue with these habits and she in unaware, I will never forgive myself.

""And He gave you from all you asked of Him. And if you should count the favor of Allah , you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful."" [14:34]

One of the reasons I want to completely wipe out PMO habits is because I feel like I'm being ungrateful to Allah. For two things: One is guidance, which is priceless and was given to me without asking/being worthy, and second is my eyesight, which a lifetime worth of worship would not be enough to thank Allah for just one eye. 

I'm a photographer, and without these eyes and hands that are used to sin with PMO, the very hands Allah has blessed me with- I wouldn't be able to do photography. 

It makes me feel sick, when I'm out with my camera, enjoying taking photos whilst knowing the same eyes and hands have been used to disobey Allah. 

Simple exercise I do to push back any PMO habits: I simply go outside, take or walk, or just look out the window (Or I sit with my chickens), and I just *look*. I just look at the world, and appreciate it. 

Then I'll look at my hand, wiggle my fingers, curl it into a fist, move it about, think about how ingenious it is and appreiciate it.

That's all I do, then I never ever want to go back to PMO again  when I look at these immense blessings from Allah.

My 50+ day streak ended as I was in a very down and out position sometime during the week, I lost control of my mental state. But, in a way I am happy this has happened. After relapsing, I had 3 sleepless nights from the pain and regret. But, I have learnt things, and the fire inside me to remain chaste has been rekindled.

I am not going to rely on the idea of marriage to save me from PMO habits, or anything else. I sincerely believe I'm being punished due to PMO habits, in fact, straight after it happened, my life began to fall apart rapidly and I saw the negative effects of sins. 

I'm not me anymore when I'm in PMO habits. Now I have learnt, after experiencing my 50+ streak, that leaving PMO will give me my life back. The feeling inside I had abstaining from PMO was something I had not felt since I was a child, the mental and spiritual clarity. I felt like a blossoming rose in a barren dessert. 

This is leaving PMO felt to me: Imagine you have everything and everyone you love around you, all of your dreams and ambitions. It's in magnitudes, by tenfolds. All of this takes the form of a bright, green, forrest. Whilst walking through the forest, you blink, and it's all gone. You're surrounded by darkness, with no guidance, no one knows you're there. You blink again and find yourself in a tall and wide prison cell with a tiny window at the top of the wall. You keep blinking and blinking hoping something will change, but nothing happens. This, is how I would describe what PMO habits feel like to me.

And then, leaving PMO; you're sat in this prison cell alone just waiting to die, suddenly, a blast of golden light knocks the walls down and reveals your origial bright, green forest with even more in it. 

I've never had such a stronger fire inside to leave this once and for all, I feel truly ungrateful to Allah falling into this sin, considering everything Allah has given me. 

As mentioned, I am not going to think about marriage until I have finished University. I want this to stop out of fear of Allah.

I've learnt that to battle these PMO habits, nothing else will work unless you are actively focusing and improving the salaat and your relationship with the Qur'an.

On the plus side, I don't feel like I am addicted. Because I am not getting strong urges or withdrawal symptoms, I've seen how easy it is to stay away from this. I'm not sure what's up with my head, I'm not sure if I'm mentally damaged (the past 5 years have been mental torture for me with various things), 

But whenever I see P, it completely messes up my head for days. It gets to the point where I become physically weak and have to rest, my Emaan feels like a heart attack with no certainty of the outcome. 

With PMO, nothing around me shines. My family, my skills, my chickens (I love my pet chickens so much), my blessings, money. 

A backstory of how I fell into this: 

First year of high school, 11 years old. Good, protective family. Religious mother, father so-so, I myself was just beginning to discover Islam but I was still very misguided with a lot of emo/punk culture. Heard some boys talking about a website that shows people doing 'XYZ', thought it must have been a joke. Why would anyone do that? 

In the living room alone playing club penguin, remembers the conversation mentioned. Types in website they mentioned and it was true- XYZ acts on video existed. Shocked, confused, curious, the novelty took over. Of course, I had no idea how bad it was. 

Vision ahead: 

Attain mental and spiritual clarity again 

Develop Taqwa and Tawwakul 

Strengthen Private parts, improve blood circulation- this *Is* important for a man to be able to reproduce healthily with his wife, and enjoy what Allah has made Halal. After PMO habits my private parts are in a lot of pain. 

Stop post-PMO habits- after PMO I over sleep, go to bed late, self-hate and loathe, binge on junk food (really badly, I've gained weight), but I'm avoiding music pretty well. Alhamdulillah.

Lower my gaze. Lowering one's gaze and recognising and respecting Allah's might. When I avoid PMO my natural desire and attraction to women spikes up so it's double the test- but worth every single second of it. No happiness to lowering one's gaze can compare. 

Be happy with myself, love myself- Be grateful for what Allah has given me.

Assalamu Alaikum. I haven't been as active as I'd like to here due to work etc. 

When falling into sin/relapsing, it's easy to beat yourself up, despair, become disheartened and feel like packing it all in. 

All of your previous efforts of restraint feel wasted and crumble away- consider this, 

Why should you let a bad day or a bad moment define who you are? As Muslims we are by default in a position of good, however, being children of Adam means we will enter stages of forgetfulness and eventually sin-

Once you snap out of that and make taubah, you're a *new* person again, keep making sincere taubah (with the intention to leave the sin) and just carry on. Don't think about when you fell into the sin. If Allah if covering your misdeeds, this is an even greater favour. 

Even if you go for a long streak and relapse- realise you are indeed capable. You've done it once and you can do it again, you are capable. 

In fact, don't count the days that go by. Count the times you fight the urge, just like any other sin. Don't let this habit determine/define/redirect your life. (Not discouraging counting the days that go by, it can be a great motivator and I think we should all do it so we can track progress).

That being said, if you do relapse after a certain numbers of days, realise that X amount of days, were more days abstaining that in the action of the habit. You can come back stronger.

Look yourself in the mirror and remeber why we're doing this- for Allah's sake, our hereafter, ourselves, our family, our future, our community, think of how great you can be.

*You can be great, and you are great, because you've made the step in the right direction to quit this, and not a lot of people will do that*

Assalamu Alaikum 

I opened up a tab this morning to ask for advice for something else, I left the house for something else and now I've come back to write something completely different. 

Since going past 50 days, one of the results is more healthier natural erections as mentioned in previous posts (sorry is this makes anyone feel uncomfortable, just let me know and I can edit it). 

However, this is a doubled edged sword. I thought I was going to relapse today, not with P but with M. Since I've kept away from M this long, I've been feeling increased sensitivity down below and when natural erections come and go the sensitivity and tingling seems to intensify. Now, I didn't know what to do about this so was seeking out help (any suggestions? Of course when you're single you can't just 'rub it off'.) It was driving me crazy. 

Today I was at a friend's aqiqah, and I was surrouned by friend's of similar age, all of whom married, and a lot with kids. I was sat in the masjid between two brothers (bit older than me) who were discussing where their life was heading. I felt like a loser in comparison. 

I used to feel like a loser a lot, and would often turn to comfort masturbation which would make me feel worse. Vicious cycle. It's partly why, I'm not where I want to be today with my studies and work. 

But sat there today, I thought about how much worse I would have felt if I relapsed this morning. If I sat there knowing I fell into M again, I would have sat there feeling 10x worse only to go back and have a week of cynical sorrow and self-pity. (That's how long it would last with me). 

The world around me began to fizzle away, I sat there with a fire inside being kindled as I realised a mark of success for myself, I didn't relapse, I didn't alow myself to feel down or depressed, I just manned up and stuck it through.

The message I am giving is to not lose hope, please don't. If I gave in this morning when I was losing hope for my 50+ streak (really, the urge to give in has been intense the past 4 days), I would have been a mess right now. 

Stay strong. Please don't give up. Keep your trust with Allah. 

I'm doing this because I want Allah's mercy, I strongly believe I have been undergoing a punishment the past 3 years because of my PMO habits, and I believe I've been denied much rizq due to my PMO habits, which lead to cynical thoughts and a lack of gratitude to Allah (if you are grateful and thankful to Allah, he will increase you in more). 

I thought about all these things today and the fire of determination inside was soaring. Previously, I would have given in and felt like dirt. 

Don't lose hope. You are strong. You are capable. Your struggles are causing a great deal of pain to Shaytaan and his army. 

Keep going.

Assalamu Alaikum. As mentioned before, I often write 'journal entries' to clear my mind and it seems like people enjoyed reading them. So I'll post a few more. Today is my reflection on how I've managed to leave other sins too whilst keeping away from PMO.

Like anyone else my age, I used to love music. *Loved* it in my teen years, but Alhamdulillah I stopped listening to music when I was around 18. The only problem was I was still falling into my PMO habits. 

Whilst falling into PMO habits, I would feel so ashamed and disgusted and disappointed, buring with self-pity. From this, I would turn to music as some relief or to give me 'company' when I was out and about. It wasn't 'happy' music either. I used to be into the whole death/black metal and punk scene. I used to go out of my way to find the angriest, most self-loathing music I could find because I was so angry with myself. 

Music is a terrible thing because it takes us away from the Qur'an and it rusts the heart,by leaving PMO I'm finding myself falling into this at all anymore Alhamdulillah. By starting this streak I've found many benefits. 

Hope you guys enjoy reading these small journal entries.

Assalamu Alaikum. This has been my best streak in years. I don't know how I'm doing it, but I am. Seriously, this is weird. Especially considering I nearly had two relapses in one day. All praise and thanks is to Allah for his aid. (forgive me if this post is long, at least you'll have something to read though, eh? :) )

Before I get to the crunch of things I want to sincerely thank the admins and users of this subreddit- I'm relieved to have found it. I was hesitant at first but I appreciate the time people have taken out to read my posts and comment, and also the support we all get from each other. I hope I can be just as useful to this subreddit. 

Now, for my report. I've actually lost count because prior to Ramadan I didn't keep count nor did I after Ramadan. Where I was fasting in the UK we had 30 days of fasting, so that's definite, then a week before, and now two weeks after Ramadan, lets say I've hit 51 days! Alhamdulillah. 

Benefits so far: 

-Less anxiety. I would feel frustrated, hot, snappy, irritated with myself for falling into this sin, or if I couldn't complete it.

-Feel more energetic. Still haven't gained my superpowers yet though. :)

-No more feeling of self-disgust and guilt, feel more 'powerful' around people. Especially considering I'm involved in a lot of Da'wah, I need this. 

-Amazing mental and spiritual clarity, this is so hard to explain. I just feel so, 'open'. I feel like a child again almost. 

-Private parts don't feel weak. This used to really make me feel ashamed and miserable. My private part was very limp, erections were weak and I used to dread the future if I got a wife. Now, natural erections (from sleeping, etc) are more full as they should be and there's more 'sensitivity'. I don't mean that for something like 'edging', but just naturally being aware of it. Before, it was just numb.

-Respecting women more. Easier to lower gaze. Women will become more beautiful (those who are halal for marriage. Men who consume a lot of porn will find their partners unattractive. Some potential sisters I saw for marriage, I *knew* they were beautful, but I just didn't *feel* anything.) 

-More time to do beneficial things.

-Greater feeling of self-control. 

-No more worrying about electrical devices getting bad viruses/hacks etc. Seriously, porn websites will put your family devices in a lot of danger from strangers and malicious (malware) attacks! 

-Lack of dizziness. I used to often get periods of dizziness, I always associated it with the sinful act of the hand. 

That's all I can think of for now. I hope this will encourage you guys. After I nearly fell into a relapse a few days ago, I felt  bit down and displaced but I'm positive or the future. Rasulullah Sal Allahu Alayhi Wa Salam loved optimism. 

I hope to write more for you readers soon, even if it's just an anecdote, I hope you can enjoy reading something you relate to, feel inspired from, or even just 'unwind' by reading something from someone in the same boat.

I'd like to share another journal entry of mine. It's very easy to have thoughts of self hate and pessimism when falling into a relapse. Sometimes it just happens. But Rasulullah Sal Allahu Alayhi Wa Salam loved optimism. 

Here is my journal entry, I hope it can be of some benefit to us here:

""“My life sucks…”

I try excruciatingly hard to hold back from saying or even thinking of such a profound and ungrateful statement.

When I’m walking around looking at all the problems I have, my non-existent savings, lack of any talent or use, I really feel like packing it all in and admitting defeat to the clutches of life’s struggles. Sometimes I like to think I’ll become some useful or recognised writer, or perhaps a master linguist but I see neither of which happening any time soon. I’ll tell you why too, laziness and self-loathing. You can’t blame anyone else. Or at least I can’t in this instance.

At times it’s almost as if the most sensible thing to do is find a patch of soil somewhere far into the woods and just lie there waiting to be consumed by the earth. All of this sort of speech by the way, is self-loathing and does absolutely no good for you.

I really try my utmost best to curb negative thoughts, the past few years they’ve become a part of my daily routine and where zealous cheerleaders for my procrastination. But as of today and at this very time of writing the article at hand, I’ve found my morale to be held captive by the narrowest, tightest and most constricted part of my head.

I really, really feel like I’ve lost at life sometimes but no matter how low I feel I know a few things: 1) I can never say “My life sucks” because that is an extortionate amount of ungratefulness towards Allah and his blessings and 2) Anything else negative is from myself and the Shayateen. You just need to shake it all off and give yourself a kick up the backside.

In regards to point one, there are people in far worse a situation than me now, my problem is I’m a lazy lump, not that I’ve lost my family to a tragic accident or I have to walk 6 miles for clean water every day. The reality, we make a lot of problems for ourselves.

There’s no point writing a self-loathing post verbally slitting my wrist. Because what good will that do? Nothing. It’ll do absolutely nothing.

I don’t deny the fact I’ve wasted a lot of time in my life, and that’s why I’m so melancholy most of these days. And I go to bed late and wake up late. Yuck, what an awful habit. Seriously, if you can master your sleeping pattern, you can master everything else, because everything else will be affected by your sleeping pattern (including Tahajjud and Fajr).

But if there’s one thing I want to explicitly make clear to whoever is reading this now: please, please, please do not waste your time and life away. I’m coming from a productive and religious perspective.

It should never be forgotten what the true purpose of this life is, that we are here to worship Allah alone. That’s one thing that helps keep me on track. Ultimately, if it wasn’t for Islam and guidance from Allah I would have be in a much worse scenario, a long time ago.

Yeah, I know I want to get married and I probably could have by now if I had a job. I could have been highly adept in the Arabic language now if I didn’t waste so much time on one set of words.

Time is so, so crucial and it’s so important we use our time wisely to invest in the hereafter, come closer to Allah, benefit those around us and build upon and put our skills to good use, for Allah’s sake (everything in accordance to Salaf-us-Salih, of course).

If there was one more thing I should mention it’s that life gets far, far worse the further you are from Allah and Deen-ul-Islam. In the past, every time I’ve had any problem, it was always rectified by coming back to Allah.

So the next time you’re feeling like loathing loaf of bread, pick up the Qur’an, make Dhikr and Taubah, do plenty of Istighfaar and reassess your relationship with Allah. Strive for Qiyaam and Tahajjud and make an abundance of Du’a to Allah.""

Perhaps this could be a thing, where we each keep some sort of log/journal/diary and share anything we think will be beneficial?

Thank you for your time reading.

As said in my previous post, I intended to write some personal reflections here on marriage, that I hope can be of some benefit and positive input to this subreddit.

To be honest, I've very hesitant to write this, because I know how influential we can be without realising it, and there are a lot of young brothers and sisters here. The last thing I want to do is negatively influence them. Islam is balance: My aim here is to *not* put anyone off marriage. I am speaking for myself, you could consider this a *diary entry*. Now to continue;

My parents are thankfully very open about marriage, and despite my mother being in two minds, she believes the best thing for me is to get married off as young as possible. My father is the same, he's wanted me married off for ages now lol. 

When I was in my teen years, I just couldn't wait to get married. Seriously, it was all I thought about, read about, listened about, talked about. It was *embaressing*, right up until around 19. By 20, (where I'm at now), I've been turned down, had to do the turning down, and been doing my 'research' :) Hey, don't worry guys- my parents are all in it together, nothing promiscious going on here. 

I suppose one of the main reasons I want to stop doing this sinful habit is beacuse I want to be able to enjoy what Allah has intended for me, and give quality performance back to my wife (sorry if this is making you blush, but I was seriously finding my private parts were becoming increasingly weak as the habit went on. Not only that but my attraction to women was decreasing). 

Through the years my toughts about marriage have been evolving through experiences and advice, it went from 'YES YES YES, LET'S GET IT DONE NOW, C'MON IT'S SUNNAH RIGHT?', to 'Well, I've got to realise the responsibilities of it all. If I'm getting married to just have sex and 'cure' this habit, will be a good husband? Am I preparing myself?'. 

Alhamdulillah, I am incredibly grateful that I'm not yet married, because to be frank I don't think I was husband material. Allah probably kept these (good) women away from me because at the time I was still falling into this sin and not making proper taubah. I genuinely believe the fact I am not married yet is a blessing from Allah. Even though I thought I loved some of these sisters very dearly and truly wanted to be with them, you just have to accept your destiny written by Allah.

The new perspective I have on marriage is this: I will do it for Allah's sake, my parent's pleasure, to have a partner in deen, make a halal lifestyle, BUT-

My problem with PMO will be dealt with by making my connection with Allah stronger! It's a sad fact, that many married men and women are still involved in their PMO habits. I feel that, if Allah made one of these girls from the past married me then, I could have been one of those guys.

If you're feeling down because you're struggling to get married, or currently have the innability, refer to my last post in the subreddit.  

Anyways, I don't want to ramble too much. I hope that by writing these sorts of things here I make a 'community' vibe, that's what we should have as family in faith supporting one another. 

I want you guys here to realise you are not alone, and that in fact you are a human, a Muslim. That means you will fall at times, but it means you will rise even higher with Allah's help. 

Stay Strong.

I have a Panasonic Lumix G6 and I find myself often volunteering for community/charity events for photo/video purposes. So far I have been using my trusty 20mm F1.7 MKII (40mm equivalent) but I'm intending to expand my kit. A lot of my shots are becoming boring or I can't get the shots I want with just this one lens.

For a wider focal length I'm going for the Samyang 12mm (24mm equivalent), but being on a budget I can't decide between the Olympus 45mm f1.8 (90mm equivalent) or the Sigma 60mm f2.8 (120mm equivalent).

 I understand that both lenses would ideally compliment each other but I'm on a budget so for the time being it will only be one or the other.

Here are my thoughts for each one:

Olympus 45mm:
-F1.8 aperture 
-90mm might be more usable indoors? 
-Better manual focus barrel (texture)

Sigma 60mm:
-Cheaper 
-Very sharp 
-Longer reach will help with getting more candid shots (But will it be too long and cumbersome indoors?)

Like many others who are young, and in this position, marriage is seen as a very obvious cure. I hope to write about my own reflections on this soon. But, marriage is not as easily accessible to everyone. Despite only being young, I have nearly been engaged/married multiple times, my parents are quite open about it but I've decided to give things some time for now. 

As someone keen on writing (I study creative writing in University) I write a lot to help me cope with my thoughts and organise my thinking space. I keep a handwritten and typed journal. This is something I wrote when I was feeling especially down, it makes me feel better when I read back over it. I hope it can benefit us. Here is the article: 

""“Why does my life seemingly lack Barakah?”

This niggling thought from the Shayateen crept into my head no longer than say perhaps six minutes ago before starting to write this.

This is a foolish thought for myself to have, the trigger being I stumbled upon a picture a friend my age posted on a social network of him and his new wife enjoying a meal out in a fancy place.


I instantly felt as if I lack much blessing in my life, and that I am lagging behind everyone else, I begin to wonder what it is everyone else is doing right that I seem to be getting wrong unknowingly and perpetually. Well, first of all, we are all blessed in different ways and Allah is the almighty and merciful and all knowing, so to question his dispense of apparent blessings is not for us short-sighted children of Adam to do so.

Secondly, we are very blessed by Allah in many ways in which we don’t even realise, some we will not come to recognise for a lifetime or not until they are taken away from us. Allah makes mention of this in the Qur’an: “It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky and produced thereby some fruits as provision for you and subjected for you the ships to sail through the sea by His command and subjected for you the rivers. And He subjected for you the sun and the moon, continuous [in orbit], and subjected for you the night and the day. And He gave you from all you asked of Him. And if you should count the favor of Allah , you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful.” [14:32-34].

Thirdly, this thought is foolish, if, one was to see little barakah in their life, it would be their own fault for abandoning the Qur’an and increasing in sin over good deeds and leaving Taubah! In Musnad Ahmad it is narrated that Thawbaan said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘A man is deprived of provision because of the sins that he commits.’” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4022, classed as hasan/sound by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah).

Tafseer Al-Qurtubi states:

A man complained to Al-Hasan about a drought, and he said to him: “Pray to Allah for forgiveness.”

Another man complained to him of poverty and he said to him: “Pray to Allah to forgive you.”

Another man said to him: “Pray to Allah to bless me with a child.” He said: “Pray to Allah for forgiveness.”

Another complained to him that his garden was dry. He said to him: “Pray to Allah for forgiveness.”

He was asked about it and he said: “This is not my personal opinion, for Allah says in Surah Nooh (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance. And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.” Tafseer Al-Qurtubi (18/301-302).

Fourthly, sometimes what we perceive to be a blessing given to someone by Allah may in turn be a form of misery for them in some case, such that they may have a nice car, and it breaks down frequently, or someone has a beautiful wife but she is not modest, or one who has a big house is unable to sleep in it peacefully at night due to his worries of debt.

Fifthly, Allah is the most merciful and sustenance comes from Him alone, so one may be ruining their relation with Allah by thinking bad in that they are being deprived by Allah. Jâbir b. `Abd Allah al-Ansârî relates that he heard Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said three days before his death: “None of you should ever die except while assuming the best about Allah.” [Sahîh Muslim (5125)].

Above all, strive to do good, make taubah, and make Du’a.""

Forgive me if this content is not in line with the subreddit do let me know.

Jazakh Allahu Khayrn. 

Stay strong. 

Edit: I fotgot to mention a crucial part to this post: It's very common for people to fall into 'comfort masturbation' in these situations, hence why I wrote this to help me realise I should be relying and being grateful to Allah.",MuslimNoFap,"Are you single and struggling?

First of all I would like to say I am incredibly happy to find this subreddit, I was initially going to post something similar to what I am writing now in the original nofap subreddit. This is my first post from this account, I am new to Reddit. I hope to add some beneficial content to this community, In Shaa Allah.

First of all, I am a 20 year old brother. Alhamdulillah my mother is very practising and she has always been a great guide for me in Islam, I am often involved in Da'wah work and find myself present in the masjid often and amongst good people. 

But sadly I have always found myself struggling with pornnography and masturbation. When I was younger I knew it was bad but did not take is seriously enough. Since 17 I have taken this very seriously, and I have actively been trying to keep away from it. But I have failed miserably until now.

Alhamdulillah this just before Ramadan, during Ramadan, and now just after Ramadan, I have had no relapses Alhamdulillah. I spent 10 days in i'tikaf too and I feel this helped a lot. I have found it much easier to leave pornography more than ever. 

This is amazing, it's the longest I've gone without it. I feel amazingly more healthy in mind, body and soul and I am without the hanging feeling of guilt around people. I feel much more productive. Since leaving masturbation and being very cautious of what my eyes see, my mind feels very clear and I feel less tired. My private parts also feel less' weak'. I feel energetic and positive. All this is from 40 or so days of abstaining from PMO. 

In the past few days I had this amazing feeling virility and almost childlike innocence and happiness that I haven't experienced for years. I felt like a brand new person. 

Now for some story of what happened today: I could not sleep much due to an incredibly painful toothache. I was falling in and out of sleep. As we know, it is natural for men to have erections in their sleep, when I woke up and felt it in my half asleep state found myself reaching for my phone with bad intentions. I didn't want to ruin things, I didn't want to lose that incredible feeling. I made a promise to Allah I would not go back to this. 

Snapping into my senses I threw the phone away and turned over and began to make istighfaar and eventually fell asleep. I felt like Muhammad Ali being titled the world's greatest boxer.

Now, the second thing in the day requires some background story: Since I was in my teens there was a sister I knew who was the daughter of one of my mum's friend. I used to think she was very beautiful and her mannerisms and deen used to make me think even more so. Eventually I told my mother how I felt and it did not go down well, I was still young. As I grew older, my mum actually played with the idea sometimes about me marrying her. My private obsession with her lasted maybe five years. Throughout this I used to have feelings of uselessness and no hope, which would lead to 'comfort masturbation', which actually makes you feel worse. 

So fast forward and she marries this guy from school I used to know, I never knew him as being very practising. But I always considered the sister to be very practising, when I attended the wedding I was so confused how it happened (Silly though, Allah willed for them two to be together thousands of years before). 

I went home feeling useless, no good, a failure. Since then, when seeing her or her husband I would feel incredibly down and like a failure. Which is silly.

Now, back to what happened. The same day I avoided a relapse, I was giving Da'wah at a festival which attracts a strong multicultural audience. The sun was out, I was with good brothers and I felt like a champ after the morning. 

Then I saw the sister with her husband holding hands. I didn't look or stare, it was 0.05 seconds of a glance. I knew she still looked how I remembered her and I was instantly starting to feel down, BUT- I could not afford to let myself fall when giving Da'wah! So I decided to MAN UP and IGNORE IT and do my duty to Allah with no distractions. 

Usually I would go home feeling self-pity and fall into 'comfort masturbation' but today I did not Alhamdulillah. I felt like two times running world boxing champ. 

The above was a huge test for me, I want to let the redditers here know you CAN overcome this. It is a mindset and with Allah with us we can strengthen ourselves.
