1. Is it worth to draw from the special Rookie Recruiter? I already drew for step 1 and got some fancy units (Eros 4S, Brahmastra, 4S Laevateinn - Arc Dragoon 4S). Should I keep using my Lazuli here for second and third step?  
2. Why different units have different colors for their stars?   
3. Why I can evolve only some of the units I have? For example Eros isn't in the evolvable list even if I know she has a 5S version.  
4. Which quests give as a rewards evolution materials?
