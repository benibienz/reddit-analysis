I would like to know some tips to play better, because I feel like I'm missing something.  
 I also have few questions:   
* Is it worth to wait 3000 jewels for the Zootropia's Avatar Board or it's better to spend that jewels on the medal pull?  
*  What's the fastest way to obtain medals, and which are the strongest?  
By far I only have 5 medals (KHII Cloud, KH Aerith, Rikku, KHII Leon Ver.B and Mushu) and I'm struggling filling the spaces in the keyblades, because I don't have enough medals ;;  
* Is there any friends system except the facebook one? What I need my ID for?
