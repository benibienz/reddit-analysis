0,"Not necessarily. At this point I wouldn't think marriage counseling would help anything. What I think is that your wife may be struggling with a behavioral disorder such as narcissistic personality disorder. By counseling I believe that you should seek counseling along with your children. Maybe go to her counselor and see if he/she has any advice on how to cope with your wife's depression. Also how to to react and speak to your wife in such a way that you can possibly begin to make small connections with her again.

In my opinion, it is up to you what to do. Don't let her control your life with her condescending words. It is very hurtful to hear things like ""you're hard to be married to"" and ""I'm going to divorce you when the kids are old enough"". Those would push anyone to the point of just needing a freaking hug. 

Btw, don't wait till your kids are old enough. They are not stupid. Take it from someone who has seen it first hand. Your kids would much rather see you happy. She sounds unstable and that negative energy will drag them down too. You can find the love you seek. ",2016-10-26 17:19:18+00:00,d98qwyn,5,t1_d98ij7p,10030,offmychest

2,"If you're adventurous add some chocolate. I always use chocolate or a little bit of cinnamon in mine. Any kind of sugar will cut the heat. You're gonna want to stop simmering it if you havent. The longer it simmers the more intense the heat will become. Same goes with salt. It will become way too intense.

Add the sugar a tsp at a time. Keep tasting until you notice the heat going down.",2016-10-05 08:37:10+00:00,d8es6eb,1,t3_55xfty,20485,Cooking
3,"I use a large stock pot and lid. I add all ingredients with their liquids (I don't drain the beans), bring everything to a rolling boil for a few minutes, then turn down to a simmer and let all those flavors simmer for as long as you want. The longer the better. Just be careful not to add too much salt or heat because the longer you simmer the more intense it will become. 

This will look way soupy at first but remember you're going to be cooking off all the excess liquid overtime. You will want to check it every once in awhile to make sure it's not lost too much liquid. If it does just add a small amount of water or broth.",2016-10-05 08:30:35+00:00,d8es2kz,1,t3_55xs5o,15068,Cooking
4,"Wow that is awesome. I had no idea that a graph even existed that plots pixel number per tonal value. With your advice and that chart I will definitely have a great starting point on the areas of the photo that need to be edited. Do you know if the iPhone offers anything that will plot a histogram or an app for the mac that is good for editing photos? 

I don't have a really nice camera. I am saving up for one though. I might need some advice about WHAT to get soon.",2016-10-04 19:18:56+00:00,d8dxswq,1,t3_55pp89,82896,AskPhotography
5,"That is great advice! I needed something to reference for what each setting does to a photo. 

I looked up once that I could turn the exposure all the way up and the shadows all the way down to fix the problem I was having with a picture I took a while back and it fixed the photo perfectly. I don't know WHY it fixed it, but I want to learn. The application of the settings is something that blows my mind lol. I have no idea what each does I just mess around with all of them. I was hoping that there was a default few that photographers mess with first before touching anything else... ",2016-10-04 18:52:13+00:00,d8dwiat,1,t3_55pp89,81293,AskPhotography
6,"So let's say I want to focus on the gorilla and have the background visible, but not pulling away from the focal point (gorilla). 

As you can see the gorilla is dark and where he was sitting was causing him to not have any light on his face so it was hard to make the facial features show up. Is there a way that I can focus on the gorilla, take the photo and get as many facial features as I can, and then go back and mess with the exposure, shadows, highlights, etc. to allow them to show up better?

For instance,[I kept taking pictures of another gorilla and could not get his eyes to show.](https://imgur.com/gallery/aw0hc) .

How could the picture be edited to see the eyes? Or is there a different way I could've take the photo to have made the eyes more visible? Such as use the flash or a different technique...",2016-10-04 18:43:54+00:00,d8dw3d2,1,t3_55pp89,80794,AskPhotography

Been in this same boat with my SO's mom. It finally took him cutting off every bit of contact so he could actually move on in life and not have to attend to her every pitiful need. Took her three years alone with her self pity and victimizing to figure out perhaps SHE was the problem. Now we are all on good terms. Going on two years no shenanigans!

13,"Honestly, I think you should honor the birth mother and all but YOU are their mother now. It's sad that she passed away but you have been there for them and they know you as their mom. 

Nick sounds like he has a deeper issue that he is keeping to himself and it is dragging him down and causing him to lash out. If he hasn't apologized I wouldn't take it too much to heart. He is probably incredibly embarrassed. I wouldn't even know how to begin to apologize for saying something like that.

Before you even think about a divorce lawyer or anything, please check around for any signs of drugs or possible alcohol. You don't want him to gain custody if he is sick. Maybe look for other shaming things that could be a factor. Money issues? Are you sure he didn't lose his job? Etc. 

You're a wonderful person (wife and mother) with a lot on your plate. You seriously sound like a saint. Please seek therapy so you do not internalize any of this. ",2016-09-22 07:54:10+00:00,d7x7dan,3,t1_d7ww2wa,22803,relationships
14,"You can tell he is trying to make you feel this way by rubbing it in like that. I always have thought guys do things like that for reassurance. They need an ego boost so they intentionally try to make you jealous. He may also just like to push your buttons or be completely oblivious to the fact that he is making you jealous in the first place. 

I think ""jealous"" is maybe a strong word for me to be using. I am not sure how it makes you feel but I know the feeling. Belittled possibly? 

If you feel comfortable enough, you should tell him how it is hurting your feelings. If he doesn't take it to heart and stop the nonsense then you should find someone that will treat you better. ",2016-09-21 18:11:56+00:00,d7wc04s,3,t1_d7ul769,100682,relationship_advice
15,"I know that it may seem odd but as a female engineer that works primarily with men on an 8:00-5:00 work schedule, we often leave around the same time. It's not a rare occasion for me to get in a deep conversation with one of them about a programming problem or work related issue and have them follow me all the way out to my car. 

It is unfair to you that he is blatantly trying to make you feel jealousy towards this woman by saying inappropriate things about her to you. That is what makes the situation of him walking out with her seem like it's not an innocent gesture. 

What I would do is ask him what his intentions were behind talking about his new office mate like that to you. You are his girlfriend and he shouldn't ever talk about anyone like that to you. That is degrading and would make any woman feel bad about herself. Be sure to let him know you won't be putting up with that.

There is something she is hiding or she is ashamed of what is on the other side of the door. It could also be tony manipulating her into being against the family. He wants full control.

19,"From the information you gave about the husbands snide comments and the way he just expects things to be handed to him (like the car or the bills being paid), it wouldn't be far fetched to say that your sister may be a victim of coercive sexual abuse. This is when guilt, nagging, pity, or accusations are used to persuade us to take part in sexual activities.

Your sister may be having mood swings and anxiety because she is falling victim to abuse. Depression can lead you to neglect your surroundings, people and things. This would explain the filthy house. 

Also, the superhuman baby she was describing to you may be her form of coping. Lying about how good things are may be heresy of escaping and hiding herself from reality.
