I went to the zoo with my SO this past weekend for the first time. Naturally, I was going crazy taking pictures of the animals with my phone. Since we were outside I would take a picture with the focus square (iPhone press and hold the screen on the point to focus and a square appears) on the animal and one without. 

I later went back through my photos and the ones I didn't use the focus with were all with more highlights and generally brighter and the ones that I used the focus were more dark but defined. In my opinion, they both looked okay. 

So my question is, what defines a good photo when it comes to color, brightness, definition, etc? I know this might make you cringe but, sometimes I even apply the filters that the iPhone has to my photos (chrome, mono, tonal, fade, etc). 

Please help! Any advice for the inexperienced is welcome. I just want to know what a good picture is from the experts so I have a goal to try to reach when I am taking photos.
