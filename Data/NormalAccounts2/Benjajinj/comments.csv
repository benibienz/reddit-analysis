0,"When they want to. All our music lessons at school were piano focused, and I can safely say that I learned fuck all from them. I was never interested in piano. At sixteen I bought a guitar for £5 from a charity store and started to teach myself on that, and now I write my own songs and play all the time. It's literally my favourite thing to do. Maybe if someone had asked me what I wanted to play at the beginning of school and we'd gone with that, I would have five more years of guitar experience under my belt.",2016-11-08 16:25:45+00:00,d9r885x,1.0,t3_5boglb,73186.0,Learnmusic

59,"I go with this one. DSI is our base representation of hollowing, giving us the standard features: 

* hollowing occurs as a result of death
* being hollow is a loss of your humanity, your spirit, the driving force

DSII happens much later and provides us with some updates:

* hollowing is not now instant, rather it is a gradual process. I personally believe that this is also true for DSI, just not shown in mechanics. NPCs often talk about going hollow and as we've seen from dialogue (Solaire for one) the mental effects are definitely gradual - why not also the physical?
* the process of using humanity to cure hollowing has become refined - imbuing effigies allows more versatile recovery.

In DSIII, everything is basically a mess. Time and space are both convoluted now (slightly preempted in DSII; Earthen Peak &gt; Iron keep anyone?)

* hollowing still seems to be a gradual process, based on what some of the NPCs have said to me (Hodrick maybe?)
* we are lower than hollow, as /u/Jotaro226 said. I reckon that having failed at linking the fire and now being reborn as ash we're somehow immune to the hollowing curse, unless we willingly accept it
* the darksign has always been unremovable, maybe not even becoming ash can rid it
* hollowing is gradual, continuing from DSI
* purging stones instead are used to cure it - these were used in DSI to remove curse, so perhaps they have more general 'curse removing' properties that now affect the hollowing curse due to it being now less entwined with us (due to being ash).

Given a bit more time I could probably think of some more, yeah. I had only just woken up! :) I can't pass comment on many of the acts you named as I'm unfamiliar with them. Interesting you say that about Iron Maiden though. I hadn't really thought about it; I was introduced to them pretty much all at once by my dad when I was young so can't distinguish them very well. Just had a look over though and the 90s are very 'wildernessy' for Iron Maiden, ending with Brave New World in 2000.

118,"I don't know what it is, but I've always hated 80's music. Even from bands active in other decades whose stuff I have enjoyed - Rush, for example. Great few albums in the seventies, Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures in 1980 and 1981, and then what my father and I refer to as 'the wilderness years' where everything is downhill again up until Vapor Trails in 2002.

AC/DC run similarly; Back in Black comes out in 1980 and is shortly followed by three of their worst albums. 

Production technology changed a lot during the 80s, with everything starting to change from analog to digital. But as well as this there was a lot of attitudinal change to rock and roll and music as a whole (Jefferson Airplane, for example). Money was becoming more and more involved and big companies were beginning to see how they could monopolise it. It's possible this could have had an effect on the types of songs being written / the way they were being recorded.

A second thing to consider though would be just how many musicians/bands remain on point for more than two decades. The only ones I can think of offhand are Rush and Yes, who have each been around for more than forty years, and Iron Maiden. ",2016-06-07 10:02:48+00:00,d3z9kk3,1.0,t3_4my6o7,2837.0,LetsTalkMusic

Outside of DkS, it'd be stuff like making enemies have more health and deal more damage without changing their AI; you don't have to learn anything new but it's harder.

Meanwhile, Frigid Outskirts is all white, so it's hard to see where you're going, so you can easily end up going round in circles. The horses spawn constantly and in numbers and if you can't take them down fast enough you will get destroyed; despite the horses not really being that hard to fight. Plus, it's a long area.

399,"It's not that, it's that the movie industry has been overplaying how much piracy damages them by a large margin. As the article says, you would have been forgiven for thinking that the industry was hanging by a thread around the time of SOPA. And this year, we have yet another report of growth and record breaking. The estimate of how much they lose to piracy is $1.5B of $38.3, or ~4%. And again, it's not that they want to combat piracy. It's that so far they've shown they want to do it by locking down everything, making everything more difficult for the consumer and only in the interest of making more money - if it was about anything else, then the CGI company responsible for Life of Pi wouldn't have gone under. Plus, the estimate of how much they lose to piracy is based upon what, exactly? It's like the statistics for unreported crimes; all hypothetical. I would assume that some percentage of piracy actually functions as advertisement. Doubt that's factored in though.

* slashes, chaining into overhead: if you're far enough away then roll back a couple times, you can start running and put distance between you. I like to roll under him if I'm too close.

* shield bash: roll away

* charge: he puts his shield up and comes straight at you. Wait for the moment, then roll forward and to your right, right up close to him.

When my family were debating what to watch, I recommend this and we all agreed - a film about a getaway driver would be sick! And the soundtrack was supposed to be amazing, so there's that too.

The plot: non-existent. Thin as paper. The soundtrack: even less existent. There's like one song in the entire film, Nightcall (which is great), and the rest is ambient stuff. Now I like ambient music, but fuck off is that anywhere near a good soundtrack. Pirates of the Caribbean had a good soundtrack, Guardians of the Galaxy had a good soundtrack. Drive has no soundtrack.

And the film.. minimal dialogue, which is fine, but tell the story in other ways! And the hyperviolence in the middle. So out of place. This bit really pissed me off, as they'd ranted about 'the elevator scene' for ages about how it was a centrepiece of film, and quite frankly it's nothing more than something Tarantino would consider space filler.

I've seen a lot of that sentiment on Reddit. It's completely understandable. My concern is that, in the next fifteen years, automation is going to (or begin to be) taking those jobs anyway, and that it's a short term plan. In relation to that, I see Europe as being more prepared for that (though by how much is debatable). I wouldn't consider it handouts, but a more beneficial interdependency - we thrive best when we all thrive. You are right with there being a values difference however, and my last point there may be idealistic.

I imagine there would be some correlation between political spectrum and ability to do so here, but that's just wondering. Not even just the internet, the outward push from the center seems to be more recent. The Lib Dems, the big middle party were decimated in our last election, for example, though that's partly because they did a fucking ham job of it. Funny about Texas though.

I completely agree with you there. Money isn't evil, they just tend to hang out together a lot. That wasn't my main point though - it was a more general wonderment at the American Dream and how you feel it affects politics. I, for example, consider myself fairly central (UK central). I don't expect to find myself in the gutter next year, but I don't expect myself to ever be earning big money - my interests do not align with the things which tend to produce that. Still, I like the idea that if everything does go tits up, there will be some kind of safety net there.

It seems (to a naive outsider) that there is less focus on this in America. Thanks for the discussion by the way, if everybody on the left and right were able to have casual chats, I think we'd see a much more unified politics (regardless of country).

605,"It was pretty nice. Our method was:

* 1x 1.5l Kilner jar (or any other preserving)
* 2x 70cl dark rum (think we just used a generic supermarket brand)
* 3x grapefruits, one yellow, two pink
* caster sugar

First we peeled the grapefruit, then extracted the flesh. I think we used the flesh of two and a half of the three. Then we took about 2/3 of the peel, scraped off the pith (white bit on the inside, that stuff tastes disgusting) with a knife. Put the jar on a scale, set to 0, then chuck the flesh and peel inside. We filled somewhere between the bottom third and half of the jar I think. Note the weight of it all. Add half that weight in sugar (500g fruit, 250g sugar; we used normal caster sugar). Pour in as much rum as you can; we found that from a 1.5l jar you could fit about 1l of liquid once the fruit was in. Shake well, put in a dark place and shake every so often till the sugar dissolves. How long you leave it then is up to you, we tasted it daily (shouldn't really do this I don't think but hey-ho, if you do make sure to shake it first and stir it a bit to get a proper taste) and after five days it was pretty nice. I think we took the peel out after about three days, though I'm not 100% sure why.. this was a few months ago. Anyhow, once five days have passed/it tastes good, pour it through a sieve to get rid of the fruit, and then into the bottles via muslin cloth, which will take out other crap (it's meant to be cloudy though).

That's about it. We were just doing it for kicks really rather than with precision, and due to the nature of the fruit etc two bottles rarely taste the same. It's the same process for any booze infusion (half the weight of fruit in sugar, shake till dissolved and leave to taste) but non-citrus fruits take ~3 months rather than a few days as citruses let the juice out much quicker. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage has a book about foraging and booze which my dad was given a couple years ago, which is where this all comes from.

The chorus patterns generally emerge from me playing with what I've already got, and then again for other sections.

If you're just starting out your songs are probably going to be simplistic and suck somewhat - don't be discouraged. Finish them, practice and rework them and carry on writing new ones. You'll work out your styles and it'll get easier and you're songs will get better. My first ones were like what you said, simple, but now I write much more complex pieces and became the 'songwriter' of my musician friends despite not being the most technically skilled. Nowadays I'll think about how I want the song to be written before I start and can transfer the idea in my head to the guitar quite accurately.
