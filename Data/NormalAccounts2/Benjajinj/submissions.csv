In DSII, I could put down a small sign near the bonfire or start of the level and when I got summoned, I could help out knowing that in ten minutes or a certain number of souls I'd be sent home - no commitment and only minorly distracting from my own task of clearing the level.

It's like Civ V, but better in almost every way. Aside from culture, I actually can't think of anything Civ does better than this. The units are better, assimilating minor factions is great, the different victory conditions and quests are sick for a strategy game, and the cultures are actually different from one another in a meaningful way.

I just finished playing as the Wild Walkers on newbie difficulty, and managed to win a Wonder victory on the 201st turn. Managed to found six cities, although as I founded the sixth I turned all focus toward production of the Wonder and so lost a few cities towards the end. Combat's nice, although slow. I wonder, how much am I going to lose by automating it all? 

The WW were a great first faction and I like them a lot, see myself playing them again and going for a different victory type. Unsure what to do next - I like the sound of the Necrophages but might learn a bit more of the game first. The modding capabilities are nice as well - currently making the colours all well differentiated as even the colourblind setting has two that are similar.

Seriously, this game has everything I felt was missing from CIv.. I can never go back!",EndlessLegend,Just finished my first game...,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndlessLegend/comments/49cdvp/just_finished_my_first_game/

My housemate and I have gotten quite into it, and over the last couple of weeks have amassed a whole bunch of spices and cooked some really nice curries (the gift was like [this one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00BTIT5EO/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=569136327&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B00BM5NQYY&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_r=0VV29ZGYTXT8RSHX0PKH) but for 'extra hot' curries).

So my first question is has anyone got any other good recipes for curry? So far we've made a madras, egg burjha, and goan fish curry, and I'll be making a rogan josh and jalfrezi soon. As far as spices go, I have paprika, cumin, coriander powder, ground fenugreek, ground fennel, mustard seeds, turmeric, garam masala, and a few others which I'll check when I'm home later. We'll try anything, so all suggestions are welcome!

My other question is regarding fenugreek in a chilli - yesterday I worked out my chilli recipe with quantities, so I could have an actual written (though still informal) recipe, which is below:

* 2 large/3 medium onions
* 3/4 cloves garlic
* 500g beef mince
* 3/4 squares dark chocolate
* 300ml red wine
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp scorpion pepper sauce/concentrate
* 2 dried Bird's Eye chillis, grated
* 2 tins chopped tomatoes

Fry the onions and garlic until the onion is starting to golden, add the cumin paprika and scorpion pepper and fry for another minute or so, add the beef and brown. Add the chopped tomatoes and after a few minutes add the chocolate, stirring in. Reduce heat and cook for the next hour, topping up with red wine every so often. 

Now this is the first dish/recipe I can call 'mine' in that I just looked up the main ingredients (onion, beef, tomato, chilli) and worked everything else in on my own. I was smelling my spices yesterday and was tempted to add some fenugreek for that celery smell and maybe coriander powder to the mix as well, but am unsure of how much to use and when to add them. I know 'to taste' but how strong will these come through outside of an Indian dish? Half a teaspoon of fenugreek? And when, with the chilli spices into the onion or later, after the tomatoes?

Any advice would be appreciated, I'm a student in my final year of university and so far have mainly been cooking for survival.
