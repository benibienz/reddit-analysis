BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GWYN I can't figure out how to fight long weapons. I know part of it must come with experience and getting to know the range of the different weapons.

Except you're greeted by the scene of her suicide, hanging by her own hair. Just as you say ""Oh shit"" her spectre appears, raising the skeletons of her deceased suitors just to make you say ""Oh shit"" again.

If you survive that and decide to take the high dive from her window you'll find where she sent all those knights to their deaths.
