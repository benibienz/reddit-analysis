10,Fellow New Englander checking in.  This will be the second winter that I will raise pigs.  They grow slower and need more food but I like having them butchered in time for the farmer's market season.  The other thing I do is build any new bee hives and frames that I will need.  I also tend to read more to get better at what I'm already doing while looking for new things to try in the spring.  By the way I also grow mushrooms but only in the summer.,2016-10-11 23:26:16+00:00,d8o1ogj,1.0,t3_570unq,2979,homestead

If it were me I would tell them that I was interested under 2 conditions; 1. that it is your full time job and your only responsibility and 2. that it would result in an increase in pay.  Also avoid becoming a salary employee if possible.  This job will be time consuming and you will be the go to person every time a nurse has a problem with an istat.  You will also have to become an expert on the regulatory requirements for POC testing.

13,"It's hard to know what's significant when you're new or even when you're experienced.  To me you're being overly cautious if you are concerned over a small difference like this.  Take a look at the levy jennings chart for mg next time that you are at work for either level of your controls.  You'll notice that running the same fluid over time will give you at least this level of imprecision.  If you were to run the same test from the same sample five times you may even see a 0.2 difference among the results.  Couple this with all of the potential variables that could have changed during the time between the two draws; medications, treatments, diurnal variation, patient hydration status, difference in specimen integrity between the 2 samples and I'm sure there are 100 others; and you'll quickly realize that you're concern is exaggerated.

24,"Don't be intimidated, jump in there and get it done.  It's not all that hard really.  Correlation is proving that the two analyzers report similar results, acceptable criteria between the two analyzers should be set in a procedure by your medical director.  You basically run the same samples on the two analyzer and show that they are similar.  Linearity is proving that your analyzer recovers the correct values across the entirety (or close to it) of you reportable range.  You run a set of linearity material, or calibrator from a different lot that you are currently running on the analyzer and plot the recovered value versus the expected values, again acceptable criteria should already be established.  Maine Standards makes some good material and will generate reports for you that includes how your peers recovered.  If you work in a good lab that rewards its overachievers my advice to you is always get involved with the things that everyone else thinks are very difficult.  You will become the expert while realizing that it's really not that hard anyway.  Just my 2 cents.

27,I've got about 20 breeders right now and about 200 or so chicks.  I also find that they do best on feed with a high protein concentration so I am currently feeding turkey starter mash.  I have used chick starter 21% in the past and they do ok but they don't feather out as nicely and quickly as with the turkey starter 28%. I was weighing how much I was feeding my breeders for a while and they were doing fine with 0.1 lb of feed per day.  So for my 20 breeders that would be 2 lbs of feed per day and I would go through a 50 lb bag in 25 days.  The chicks eat varying amounts dependent on their age but I always want mine to have feed in front of them so they can grow as quickly as possible.  This summer my feed bill was pretty high as I was hatching out chicks and selling them to a local farmer once they were 3 weeks old.  I have pretty much incubated all of the eggs that my breeders have laid since April and my feed bill is  a little north of $1000.00 but I still have about 15 bags of feed in inventory and I feed organic feed which is costing me about 28.50/bag delivered (I buy it by the pallet mixed with chicken feed).  I have 2 hovabator incubators which I was filling every 10 days with about 160 eggs to keep up with how much my hens were laying.  My hatch rate was only 50-60% (I turn by hand because my quail eggs are too big for the turner) which was still plenty of chicks but now I am slowing down as my farmer buyer has fallen through.,2016-07-20 12:20:37+00:00,d5jg7xn,1.0,t3_4tiqwl,123347,homestead

29,"I was a very poor high school student who never studied and had little interest in school.  When I graduated high school and started working at a gas station then factory for very low wages I reconsidered some life choices and decided to go back to school.  I started at a community college and realized if I tried really hard I could do really well.  I eventually transfered to a bachelor's degree in biology and earned a minor in chemistry.  I am really interested in animal behavior so I moved to Oregon and got a job with the Oregon department of fish and wildlife.  The problem that I ran into was that I was making less than  I was when I worked at a gas station or factory and I had no benefits and my employment was only guaranteed for 6 months at a time, so I decided to go back to school and become a medical technologist.  Now I am a Family man with children, a Supervisor in a medical laboratory and I've started my own small farm.  I like my work but do not love it and a little piece of me will always long to be back in the woods and rivers of Oregon but my employable career has allowed me to follow other dreams so overall I am satisfied and don't dwell on what ifs.  No matter which direction you take there will be many turns in the road.

35,I've processed chickens before at my place a few years back.  We had 4 killing cones that the chickens would be slaughtered in.  then we scolded them in 140 degree water that we had in a big pot for about a minute by dunking them several times.  Next we plucked them by putting them into the plucker that we rented from craigslist.  Then we had a table setup to eviscerate them.  Next we put them into shrinkwrap bags.  Then we dunked the bags into boiling water for about a second to get them to compress around the birds.  Then we used hog rings to seal the bags.  My wife and I processed 50 chickens this way one summer and it was a ton of work.  The chickens were great though and held up in the freezer really well.  Now I bring them to have them processed because I try to sell at farmer's markets and they have to be slaughtered at an approved facility if you try to sell at a market.,2016-07-10 22:55:27+00:00,d576ra3,1.0,t3_4s71ff,11200,homestead

I've always felt that my chicks grew fine on 21% organic starter but I wanted some data to see for sure. Of course this is no conclusive study, I'm no animal scientist (but if there is one out there I'd love to hear the population size recommended to conduct a more conclusive study).

62,I've been raising quail and chickens for about 5 years.  Quail cannot be free ranged like chickens.  They must be kept in an enclosure or they will leave and usually not come back.  Sometimes they will come back for a day or two so you might have a chance to catch them again but usually not.  Also chickens are so much larger than quail that if you kept them together the chickens will peck the quail and kill them.  A woman bought some quail from me once an tried it herself (against my advice) and the quail were killed by the chickens within a day or so.  I have tried a few different tyoes of cages with my quail.  My favorite way to keep them is in a fully enclosed pen that sits on the ground and I move it daily.  my webiste is www.sunnypatchfarm.com  where I've got some pictures,2016-05-05 17:36:46+00:00,d2u1unv,1.0,t3_4ed5ut,2055939,smallfarms

I asked her if she had eaten the Doritos the day before and she couldn't remember.  I told her that tomorrow she wouldn't care if she had eaten the Doritos the day before so she should just pass since it won't matter anyway.  Then I told her that this is how I think about big purchases.  When I'm considering a big purchase I think about a thing that I've really wanted in the past.  Then I think about where that thing is today and it's usually in a closet and hasn't been used for months (my guitar for example).  This line of reasoning for me makes it easier for me to just not want to buy things because I know if a few weeks/months I probably won't really care about it that much anymore anyway.  One exception that I make is for tools because they usually save more than they cost in the long run.,2016-05-03 15:41:47+00:00,d2r496e,1.0,t3_4hn21n,10720,financialindependence

78,"I just started with my first pigs in November and am glad to share my experience.  I bought a solar charger from premier electric, their intellirope for the wire and a bunch of step in posts.  I setup two strands of wire and tied a small piece of rope from one to the other.  One this small piece of rope I connect my positive clamp then I connect my negative clamp to the ground rod.  To train the pigs to the electric I setup five pig panels in a pentagon shape and had the electric setup inside of it first.  I did this just in case the pigs  went straight through the electric.  After about 2 weeks I took down one og the hog panels and extended the electric fence outside of the pentagon.  After they tore up the land that I had them on (about two weeks, I would reposition my electric fence to give them new land.  They were doing awesome this way and never got out once until 3 days ago.  My wife and I had a baby and the person who was taking care of the pigs did not go feed them in the morning.  By the time I got home in the afternoon two of the three pigs were out rooting up a new piece of ground.  I lured them back in by dumping some food into their fenced in piece them picking up one of my step in posts so they could walk right in.  The problem was that after they ate the food one of them walked right through the electric.  My jig was up.  I now have them back in their pentagon with the electric inside where I'll leave them for a week or two to try to retrain them then try to give them a fresh patch of ground again surrounded just by electric.  If you use single strands instead of the netting never give them a reason to get out and they won't.  If you rely on someone else to feed them one time they might not feel like walking all the way back there in the rain.  In the future I will probably switch over to netting.",2016-03-05 00:42:44+00:00,d0o145r,1.0,t3_48gjcb,297655,homestead
