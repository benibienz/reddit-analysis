The more that I've been keeping bees the less I care about getting honey and the more I enjoy learning about my bees.  That's why when I saw that one of my hives had swarmed last week I was more excited at the opportunity to catch my first swarm than I was bummed that I probably wouldn't get honey from one of my hives this year.  
    So the family was eating dinner over at my mother in laws house who lives next door and we saw a swarm of bees about 12 feet up in a tree hanging from a branch.  The bees were about 30 feet from my hives so I knew they had to be mine.  I quickly grabbed my veil, gloves, a box and pruners from my place then came back to my mother in laws.  I was able to position a ladder so I could reach the bees easily.  I climbed the ladder and cut the branch with one hand while holding it with the other.  Once it was cut I carried it down and put it in the box.  I didn't have any empty hives but I have a neighbor who I knew was looking for a swarm for his empty hive so I walked down the road with my box of bees and did the most neighborly thing I've ever done.  He opened his hive up and I took out the branch and shook them in for him.  There were thousands of bee flying everywhere which in my opinion is the hardest thing for a new keeper to get used to.  A couple of days later I stopped by and they were still there drawing new comb and doing their bee things.
