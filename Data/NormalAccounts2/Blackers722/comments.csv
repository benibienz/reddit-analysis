It's not the first time he's had problems with them either. He's been a long time collector of Lambo. Has another SV in the USA, had a Huracan. Also has a Murcielago Versace Edition, Diablo, etc etc. Owned a Veneno at one stage as well. He's ordered a Bugatti Chiron as well to replace this Veyron. So this guy is definitely one of the most serious car collectors around.

With the SV specifically he had loads of problems. 
Lambo promised it'll get here before Christmas, it only got here in February. 
He even had to pay for his own flights to come to JHB from Cape Town and organise his own tow truck to get the car back down to CPT as they were to useless to organise it. When he went to pick up the car, the brand manager didn't even come to greet him. So that's just plain rude and disrespectful
