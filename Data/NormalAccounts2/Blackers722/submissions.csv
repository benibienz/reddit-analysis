Its a more ""modern"" version of the classic MK1 GTI golfs. Same characteristics, same base idea - the sad thing is the rest of the world never got this car, it was for the south african market only. South Africa got the MK1 golf until 2009, with subtle changes and motor variations. This CTI came with a very 1.8 K-jetronic Fuel system. They make around 80kw, so they are peppy little cars to drive. I feel they would have been great cars for the rest of the world. Later the Citi life was to follow then the Velocity and then finally the Citi R line. - they were very basically spec'd, Aircon, winding windows, no power steering, no ABS no EBD, and airbags only came in some models from 2005 up to 2009. The later Model CTI's came with vinyl seats and some specs came with semi bucket seats. 

The best thing about these cars is that all the body parts are interchangeable from 1990 to 2009 so there are tons of spares!

Its a great car dont get me wrong - however it does feel very similar to the 2016 Audi RS3 hatch, just with a bit more HP and better in the corners, same same but different. 

I want to say a huge thanks to the guys at Audi Cape Town for the great service and good coffee.
