2,"Diasbling weapon and item drops in custom games would actually be fun! But if they do it i would like them to also disable just one of the weapons. So that u can disable sword and spear and then if like gnash and bodvar play each other the both only get hammer drop. Setting lives individually? Dont know why but i guess they could also do that. Changeable stats? I mean u can change ur stances and i feel like thats allready useless... I mean its fun to play nai with even more def and running like 0,1mile per hour but i dont see why u would do that tbh. And the strikeout thing. I dont really know what to think about that.
