31,"Finding a job in IT: Depends on your experience, but there are a lot of great jobs in IT all over Denver - especially in the ""Denver Tech Center"" area.

Cost of living: Varies wildly from $1400 studios downtown, $1400 1BR near downtown, and $1200 1BR in some of the surrounding suburbs.

Public Transport: Is good and getting better. The lightrail - train - goes to a lot of the suburbs and airport. Buses are just as shitty as any other city.

My advice: Find a job first. It sucks to move somewhere with nothing in line. Also, if you think you're not really going to make it out into the mountains much then there isn't much incentive in owning a car. That's one thing you could think about if you want to live somewhere you can take the train to work and/or downtown.

Overall: People are friendly (lots of midwestern transplants), traffic if shitty, mountains are amazing, rent is rising, beer is great!

Make the rules very clear and consistent.

Have two decks so one will be ready to go at the start of the next hand.

Only you handle the money.

Provide water.

Also, there are a few poker apps with timers that you can set up for the structure. You just input how many people, chips, time, breaks, etc, and it calculates it all for you.

One time during a Little League game I was playing Left Field (that's how good I was). Anyway, 4th inning just started and I'm standing out there and suddenly get the urge to purge the poop. I don't remember my entire thought process, but needless to say, I concluded that instead of calling a time out or announcing to everyone that I have to poop, I decided it would be best to just shit my pants. It's a good thing we wore those baseball pants that are tight around the ankles because that's what held it inside. After the inning I immediately go to the porta-potty and wash the shit out the best I can. Don't remember what else happened that game, just the shit in my pants : (

My two cents: Perhaps just flyering vehicles at the events. I'm imagining fields of thousands of vehicles and leaving a flyer on the car, while maybe not changing anyones mind, will at least get Bernie's name out there more and serve as a small reminder to vote. 

I think it's important to remember that there is no one magic bullet to getting people out to vote, but it's more of a collection of reminders up until the day.",2015-08-31 17:06:49+00:00,cum016z,1.0,t3_3j2dln,27861.0,SandersForPresident
