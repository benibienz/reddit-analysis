I've found a few switch boxes that would probably work, but I want to design it in such a way that everything is hidden except for a simple switch so I think it will take a little fabrication. 

[This](http://imgur.com/Pq08Asv) is the basic idea of what I'm doing, but I'm not certain on the switch part. Can I just buy a toggle switch and solder the connections? If so, is there certain material that's going to be better? Is there specific diameter wire I should be using? Any tips or ideas on this would be greatly appreciated! 

Would I be able to use something like [This](http://www.amazon.com/NTE-54-667-Switch-Actuator-Height/dp/B00BYEASBC/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1445188616&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=slide+switch) as the switch?

So we hooked up, but never really dated, about 9 months ago. After she told me she was pregnant I said that I would be there 100%, but that I was not interested in being in a romantic relationship with her. We decided to move foward anyhow. Fast forward 8 months: We decide that it makes the most sense for me to move into her place, in the spare room. That would allow for me to be there all the time and make it easier when balancing my two jobs and the 20 minute commute between our places.

During this time, 7 months pregnant, she decided it would be a good idea to start dating someone, and that's what has complicated the situation. Our baby is 5 days old and I obviously want to spend every day and night with him. Our first night home, no problem. We slept in her bed, baby in his bed. Yesterday before I went to work she told me that her boyfriend was coming over so she said they would sleep upstairs on the fold out couch and when I got home (around midnight) I could just take our baby and sleep in her bed (it's also where the crib and all that important stuff is). Cool. However, last night, in the middle of my shift she send me a text saying ""wait, why should I not sleep in my bed, I shouldn't feel bad for having a boyfriend, blah blah blah (paraphasing)"". So instead of me being able to come home to my newborn baby, I had to sleep up in my room while she slept downstairs with her boyfriend and my child.

I'm not sure what to do in this situation. She's pretty immature, sensitive, and resentful. Basically, I just want to tell this asshole to back the fuck off and if he gets in the way of me and son he'll regret it. However, I know that isn't the best way to come to some sort of resolve. 

Any would be greatly appreciated.
