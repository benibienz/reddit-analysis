Now on iOS 7.1 symlinks r broken and i had to find a workaround.

Glad that it's the last iOS with actual app folders tho, so moving files there and stuff is easy and possible.

App icon themes are fine (using Soft).

The bootlogo of iOS 7 is so heavy cancer too, RIP.

If this seems all pretty unstable and scripty to you tho, you should consider making this a tweak request then i guess..

Install activate command

Create a shell script with iFile

exit

-

and then create an activatecommand with the properties 'sh &lt;absolutepath to the shell script&gt;'

Then use activator: on wifi disconnect: 'activate command' (the one with the timer).

And create another activatecommand, but this time enter 'pkill sh'.

Create an activator event on wifi connect: 'activatecommand2'.

Done.

Your wifi will now be disabled 1 hour after you disconnect from your hotspot.

Activator: on wifi disconnect: activatecommand1, which is sh /folder/wifioff_timer.sh

The script would have

-

sleep 3600 (1h)

activator.com.someshit.wifi.toggleoff

Exit

-

And the event on wifi connect would be on wifi connect: run activatecommandscript 2, which would be the directory to the script /folder/stopwifitimer.sh or the script itself

pkill sh

It links to the GPS / detected location.

It didn't work within proxies or on a virtual server for me. It should work on 'normal' desktop pcs and ecspecially on mobile devices. I guess the only required parameter is that google somehow thinks you are *somewhere*. It may not show results for specific countries, lands or etc, but i can verify it works in NRW, Germany and i see no reason Google would only implement this ""In the near"" search in our country part only.

That's the website.

The link points to http://cw.zircon.at/Cube_ZirconRealms.exe

That's just a magically improved version of the default Cube.exe that allows you to join.

And sorry about our main zircon.at website, i'm currently really busy with life and re-arranging my gaming network aswell. Working on so many projects can take some time :P

Many of these sub websites aren't really done yet, only the CubeWorld one currently works, as a source for our custom client.

If you are good at HTML5 and CSS, and also have a knowledge of what people want in these days regarding website technologies and stuff, you sure can help me out a bit if you want to.

Edit: ditched a lot of the old source code and also switched to material design here.

And just to clarify: http://cw.zircon.at is different from http://zircon.at/cw, which is an index / description website. http://cw.zircon.at belongs rather to the gameserver itself than to the gameserver network.

2002,"Had these strange things aswell, blocking specific botnet IPs and applying some fixes against the automatic joins via an DDoS firewall.

just as pesky as double connected players i say.

You may also apply some tgen bugfix through a cuwo mitm server or switch to cuwo completely, this should permanently fix it.

ofc this bug can also appear on cuwo servers, because the vulnerability was put there by wollay in the first place.

see http://cuwo.org and https://github.com/matpow2/cuwo/wiki for help.

The bug has been reported multiple times to wollay tho, but he didn't fix it in any version yet.

And i guess it won't only affect europe servers, as the server location doesn't have to do anything with the server.exe itself, as it's a cubeworld bug. cubeworld can be very glitchy sometimes.

Also thanks for including my servername in there, a lil bit of advertisement can be very good sometimes &lt;3

it's some standard message tho i guess.

i think it's funny how they don't include herocube, since it's / it was the fourth biggest server in cubeworld apparently.

I highly think it's one of the server owners from these servers: https://www.gameservers.com/game_servers/cube-world.php or just some hacker trolls.

i keep getting attacks like this daily still (people getting teleported or dieing without any reason), even tho my custom wrappers, blockers and detectors block most of these connections.

about the ""weather thing"": it appears to be some type of hacked lamp. cuwo has a blacklist for items with such modded values. if you don't want them on your server, you can turn on cuwo_anticheat for that.

Another edit: AH, it seems like he's reading the http://cuwo.org/servers.json file and looking for servers that have some tag named cw in their list for the recommend thing.

another suggestion is to make your server white-listed, like Neszy did (on Discord).

I once ran a test server on a new i7 machine and also got that bot just joining and killing my pet and me.

maybe they just ping random ips to check if port 12345 is opened and connect to that somehow.

i banned it's ip address and around 6 hours later, a new one of these spawned.

they didn't write anything tho. this was about 4 months ago btw.

And the name ""wollay"" could come from the default player entity being named ""wollay"" (you can glitch if you eg type /connect x when the game starts, i guess they have some automatation running in some cloud platform for this, so cubeworld messes up on them), the empty name could either be the ""player loading"" entity, which is pixxie's character by default, or a custom created one, which i doubt. it could be a fusion of both of them, mostly caused by automatation, lack of ram or anything else that makes cubeworld odd.

Also make sure to report to the Server Owners that their servers might have some bugs

also indicating that it only happens to *some* of the gameservers.com servers (the europe ones only), the origin could come from the american ones maybe.

**another thought: this (reddit) may not be the right place to post bugs, drama, hackers or anything else you find in servers of other users. i think a pm or a contact mail to the owners would be the best place so they get to know what they can fix. anything in-server related should go to the people who run these servers imo.**",2016-05-13 21:13:57+00:00,d34jpic,1.0,t3_4j845s,4343.0,CubeWorld

well, in the past i used a iPhone 4 for navigon.

it was kinda ok.

but still, i would love a spare iPhone 6 or even plus as a navigation device now.

about texting: always was ok on 3,5 and 4 inch as ""you can click all the buttons"". but it always was awkward cuz the keys were so small and the keyboard blocks the whole screen.

if i was you, i would get the 6s or a 6.

also: 16 gb = 12 gb, 5 gb is left once you install the apps including navigon.

32 is ok. that's 26 i suppose, 20 with the apps, 14 with the music.

so you get about 10 gb of space here for taking pics, um a few thousand. and about 5-6 short movies.

but really, invest the 100 (or 200) more for the 64 if you can!

here you start with 56 gb, which will leave you about 30 gb once everything is put and setup you can fill with photos.

however, i now feel that even 128 gb isnt enough for me after years of usage with a few thousand photos and hundreds of apps lol.

For the 5/5S/SE: https://youtube.com/watch?v=OSMbknKRnAY

Here's the one you should go for.

The build quality is outstanding.

But while it doesn't add any real protection to the screen, i would use a glass protector aswel (goes over the case, cellularline has the best ones imo) or a plastic one (gets covered by the cover).

I only have it for my phone not to be slippy, for good protection against scratches and everything to the sides, top and bag, because i can access all buttons, it's lightweight, feels very good and also looks awesome.

I can really recommend getting one when you have the chance. Or 2 for a few more months / years of cover.

I would get one that matches your SE's color tho, i only had the chance to get a brown one with a black 6S, which isn't perfect. I missed my chance before to buy 2 ebony versions ;(

Well, the case is worth for it and build quality is outstanding and way better than any comparable competitor wood cases around in my opinion.",2016-04-27 14:36:29+00:00,d2jcges,,t1_d2j84pr,7199.0,iphone

b) wieder das Spiel kaufen.

Man braucht übrigens Paypal. Falls du kein Paypal-Konto besitzt, kannst du es so machen wie ich im Juni '13: Geh zu ePvP und such dir nen ""Umcasher"". Dem gibst du dann den PSC-Code (damals 25€, dat Spiel hat 20 gekostet mein ich..) und sagst ihm, was er machen soll. Dann kauft er dir das Spiel per PayPal und du kannst die Login-Daten wieder ändern.

(Könnte allerdings nen paar Monate /Jahre dauern, bis du dies alles machen kannst, kommt auf Wolfram an.).

they are the reason why slither.io, agar.io, all the google stuff, facebook, whatsapp and co are free.

they monthly need to pay millions of dollars for their servers, each company on their own and for projects of them.

but they are all free. so they track what you do using scripts, cookies, sessions and log files and sell that data to other companies and so they earn the money for their servers.

eg the skins on slither.

you only get them when you agree that they use your udid to always identify you, regardless of browser, location, pc, etc. so they can make the ads fit to you, tell google, facebook and twitter WHERE you are, WHAT devices you use, WHO belongs to you (friends, siblings, family, etc), and how long you do this stuff. then slither sells these data and this is where they get the roughly 30.000 dollars they pay for their servers monthly",2016-04-18 19:23:40+00:00,d27w3sd,3.0,t1_d27v0ns,1415.0,Slitherio

iOS is way too bright. Microsoft's latest SwiftKey theme goes a good way tho.

Almost all pixels activated (which iOS 7+) requires burns them out too fast i think. LCDs don't care if they're always on, but on OLED having a ton of pixels white almost all the time (eg browsing or anything system-based) *can't* really be good for them =/

Well, the old days had more colors everywhere, but still..

That's why iOS must go back to black. Which it already did with the wallpapers. And the watchOS interface. Stuff is dark. Darker than dark. Black with white / green labels and nav buttons mostly and i love it. Iirc, carOS also was mostly black. But that's another story, as most carplay screens are low res lcd ones. TvOS is.. mm black with some colored elements? Or was it white with colored?

The model maker was created by Wollay. He and her wife, Sarah von Funck use it to create these cubic models.

Here are some screenshots and a verification of that by pix_xie:

Cubeworld is portable btw. You should also find a zipped version online if you don't want to go into some torrent or virus / survey sector.

You should search ""cubeworld download free"" on YouTube.

You must run the Cube.exe btw. If your download has no cuve.exe or basic folder structure like data-1.db something or a logo or pointer file, you better dispose that zip.

Also only look for direct downloads like from mediafire.

The game will run normal and fluid, but also has it's limits.

Like it can only use about 128 mb of ram efficiently or make use of the armv6 cpu etc... the same goes about crash bandicoot nitro cart 3, where the max device power it could use was on the iPhone 4/4S.

Sure, it's not that those games will lag now, but they just don't use what's there. The only thing you might get is that it uses a slightly bit less of your voltage than on legacy devices.

You must imagine the same for pc games.

An old win xp game will also not be super fucking awesome and everything on the latest gtx. It will run, maybe fluid, and that's all.

3083,"yep it does. on about 3/10 graphic settings, it doesnt look that awesome, but it's really fun to play.

well, if you want compatibility and great overall performance, i would choose win7. win8 and 10 are of course faster at boot (it takes bout 40s or longer on win7) due to windows being a vm that never really is restarted, only halted, but of course do eat more ram and stuff in general.

my battery time is - ok - i get about 3 hours with everything on (brightness at max, etc).

the hardware works well with win7, which isn't the case with 8 or 10, as most of the drivers for the machine weren't designed for the old machine.

performance is really great, apps open fast as hell, mac os x (old, very old, or actual versions like yosemite) lags for me and is too slow compare to win7 imo.

i currently have a win8 skin on win7 (http://mare-m.deviantart.com/art/Windows-8-8-1-Theme-for-Windows-7-318932206), so i don't need win8 for a great look.

win8 itself is shitty-coded, and nothing for macbooks.rather for windows tablets with their apps.

well, you can try win10, which is a lot better in compatiblity with the macbook, but also has the windows clutter all the time, like useless apps and updates you can't stop.

if i were you, i would just get win7 and hammer the windows 8 or windows 10 theme (http://mare-m.deviantart.com/art/Windows-10-Theme-for-Windows-7-500491733) on it. also get start button changer (http://www.door2windows.com/windows-7-start-button-changer-change-your-windows-7-start-button-with-one-click/).... windows 7 seems just like it was made for the macbook air performance-wise and usability-wise.

if you rely on win10 somehow for future-proofing do it, but it's rather a beta software, and win8 is a mess imo.",2016-03-27 20:05:29+00:00,d1fjorc,5.0,t1_d1fjfr1,458.0,apple

That's a non-reproducable issue and a great excuse for the free annual replacement by AppleCare+.

I now have:

 temperature issues (phone heats up a lot even when i wouldn't do anything with it and it's locked)

 random restarting, some green stripes come on the screen and it just restarts itself every FEW hours, even after restore and latest update

 cellular issues, the signal keeps dropping like every 10 minutes and often even switches to 'no signal', even when in the same place it worked for hours before these errors occurred.

Any other ideas? Cause i just can't give me phone to them after a year or 2 and just say, ah it doesn't look to great, used up and the battery lost like 10-15% battery after a year of use.

Back to post: i would stay away from the 9.1 Jailbreak, it's too instable after time and you will just end up in losing all you app / system / photo data thanks to the restore

btw: i guess you can disable the batteries (i enabled them before and disabled the widget again), it's also possible to hook into that native SBSettings pack with MobileSubstrate to disable the double ~~rainbow~~ battery icons everywhere.

And yes the cracks are mostly in the glass back, steel doesn't crack and dropping it never hurt the internals of my phone (it dropped like 10 times now in 4 years).

For the next time i would suggest a case, if you like that. So at least the front or back glass of the current or future iPhones don't explicit break anymore on drop.

If you're concerned about battery life of the 4S, try charging it via a normal usb wall plug.

If you get access on the mac, run the iTunes battery check.

You can find more info about this online.

If you're jailbroken, get BatteryLife to check directly.

Maybe the power adapter inside is really broken, you could tty consulting an electronic guy near you or oder stuff at ifixit for the battery cable holder.

Also try a hard reset before you connect, it may a software issue aswell.

Also try another usb port on the Macbook and another cable.

You see there's a lot you could do.

Hope it get's well and will connect again.

this is shit as he can put and run whatever he wants.

he also put a local cubeworld server and webserver on the victims pc. for forums he says.

just get cuwo and do everything server-side, cuwo already is strong enough! or get cuwo + mitm which would also support a vanilla server but lag like shit as atleast double of the packets get spammed between server and clients
