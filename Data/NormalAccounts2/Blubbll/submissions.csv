And now think all your data is gone because you didn't do an backup at all (cuz who needs those anyways(heh))?

Well, there's ONE single backdoor you can use to continue using your iDevice as if nothing happened, even if you unjailbroke it in a very nasty way.

It doesn't even have to be read by your PC anymore in normal mode.

So, how to do it?

Just go into DFU (google that, newb!)

Then shift restore to the latest signed http://ipsw.me

Then wait until the iBoot partition got updated (After extracting files in iTunes) and your iDevice starts.

Then rrrrrIP that cord off your iDevice.

Plug it back in.

iTunes will now offer an 'Update' button.

Shift-update to the latest ipsw and you're done.

Update failed?

Home+Power

Shiftupdate

Done.

Enjoy!

And yep, you'll be on the latest iOS Version. Nothing could save your horribly broken, non-A4 device anyways. It's not like luca or iH8Sn0w would share any exploit, so nah.

I did this two times now (iPhone 6S 9.0.2 &gt; 9.1.someshit, deactivated locationd [nobody told me it'a forbidden since iOS 9] and iPad mini 6.1.2 &gt; 9.3.5 (renamed AT launchdaemon a to A)[welp, 6.1.2 is horrible for viviwo, VLC anyways and has a shit mini UI on the mini, but UI is fine on an iPad 2 on iOS 6.)

Welp, enjoy and save your broken data lel

Btw: iFunBox for the stuff you stored in your /mobile/!

*notresponsibleforanything*

You might not be able to save everything directly thx to apples a*hole iOS 8.someshit policy about Sandboxing and over USB. Do a backup then and extract it with iBackUpBot eg. Or i&lt;insert your fav iTunes Backup parser program for your OS)

Sry about that shitty and messy formatting.

Hope this can help a bunch of people who messed up their installation.

And yep, tons of your jailbreak data will persist (special settings like screen resolution, tweak settings etc)

Enjoy!!

Not only does it poison our SEO, ecspecially since the 'Serverlists' have a bigger hit on google (monetized and used by trillions of vistors), thus making our Results lower at google, it also males players of both us and competitors services being led to tje wrong goals.

So, what should i do here? And i don't think i could pay the 600$ or what about it for the trademark just now (found a 170$ registration, but that seems a bit fishy..).

For example the tweak MyAssistive and others or even no Tweaks at all can cause an infinite Reboot loop (caused by the Accessibility service hardcrashing SpringBoard's routines in combination with the Mobile Substrate injection. You surely have read that in your syslogd: AX(SpringBoard)Server. This is a pain in the ass and often hard to fix (requires a ton of reboots or disabling CydiaSubstrate).

Here's the final resolution (which took me about 2 months to find out):

Simply load the AT daemon after boot, earlier than SpringBoard.

You can do it like following: Use a text editor (iFile) to insert loading the AT daemon after the FileIntegrity daemon in /etc/launchd.conf:

-

load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.MobileFileIntegrity.plist

**load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.assistivetouchd.plist**

setenv DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES /private/var/untether/_.dylib

-

**Also make sure that the boolean 'RunAtLoad' is set to *false* in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.assistivetouchd.plist, cuz it gets loaded with the launch.d daemon anyways with this configuration. It's also important to disable [Enable Transactions], ecspecially on iPad mini 1g, this will increase the success rate a lot, cuz it won't call to other daemons anymore and tell them that it loaded (debug only).**

(paste the **strong** marked sentence in the said position (or atleast under the file integrity daemon.) This will make sure that AT will get load early enough for it's vanilla service to start unaltered by CydiaSubstrate.

And boom, you no longer have to worry about the annoying Non-Boot glitch caused by AT.

Ofc, your System may sometimes still fail after 2 Minutes, like usually (p0sixpwn made a great hotfix tho (restart after 2 mins)) **but** if a InfiniteBootloop wants to appear, this method kills it and starts your device normally.

You might need to enter Non-Substrate mode to apply the change. Lock your device (saves every open-cached file and setting), wait 30 seconds and toggle it off. Then boot it and enjoy MobileSubstrate and AT / AX working fine together!

Tested on iPad 2, iPad mini 1, iPod touch 4 and iPhone 5.

This is 95% safe. I'm not responsible for any mistakes you do (eg deleting the launchd file or stuff), i also cannot guarantee that this will work for any device and /or specific system configuration (eg own AT Tweaks, AT Hardware, etc.).

but, is the price tag of 200$ really worth it? It's 16 GB, the only way iPad 2,4 can be.

WiFi nor anything is broken.

I would downgrade it straight to 6.1.3 using Beehind...

anybody got experience with this device, is it worth that rather high price?

First i gotta say sorry, but the rolling out of the Proxies doesn't go so smoothly as i thought, i even had to rebuild my API two times to get things working.

C9 has a working proxy yet, same as a Discord Bot. (broken now, need to write a new bot api for them aswell sry).

Please hop on C9 and report any bugs you find such as proxy crashes and tell me what you did to make that happen, thanks!

Well, back to the Discord bots.

These will sit in the Discord Zircon Realms channel and will show the current player stats on the server, you can see the Server number as their picture and right next to it.

The proxy makes sure that people who stay AFK too long get kicked, that /connect a does no damage and / or clones and that /connect a'd people who switch servers that way, get disconnected properly aswell.

Other from that, the proxies each compress the data packages by around 50% and make the game experience on the Servers even more smooth and cool!

I'll share with you what i got so far :D

First, the 0-World has a partly broken minimap, see [this](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/2qPeCq.png) and [this](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/iis8Qd.png).

The model of the platform is called character-platform.cub, see [here](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/4JFWpL.png)

While Mission icons (the swords) are shown, the the world's terrain actually isn't.

The 0 world has no fixed seed and is saved in a temporary space (in memory) only.

The Spawn is the same as on normal maps, but just on the Platform (well, all spawns go to the highest point, so that's not too special here i guess).

There are no towns, i checked by going to the Spawn town's position and there was just a valley.

As you may already know, the Zero-World has working spawn statues aswell.

There are no mobs or NPCS in the Zero world.

But there are world objects (heartflower eg) and objects (fireplace) which are generated throughout the world, just like normal. And yep you can also use them normally. [Image](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/zq5Uxa.png).

No entities are spawned (eg ores or plants you can attack).

World loading (blue fog and please wait) also apply here.

every cub and other world generation stuff like roads is present in the 0-world.

Dropping and picking up items works here. On the whole normal world (means between the 0 and + corner).

You can also take damage here (eg by falling) and die and respawn.

There seems to be no time, the time stays frozen at 9:00.

The main (spawn) biome will, like on every other map, always be plains.

Pets don't spawn there.

When you reach a mission, there will be the generated structure and the mission text.

Chat, commands and pickup messages work and are shown. [Image](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/8jvqR9.png)

Traps work in the castles (eg spikes) and do damage. All normal items are generated in a castle.

Like normal worlds, the 0-world is limited in space aswell [Image](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/9K798K.png)

All other world mechanisms (attacks) and items (eg glider) work normally here.

Bombs do work aswell (they get rendered on place, explode, do player and world damage) as expected.

Light updates work (eg by the lamp, the lamp item works).

Edit: After going to the Border of the map, the mission signs are gone. I guess the buildings aren't tho.",CubeWorld,Exploring the 0-World.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/4m7eik/exploring_the_0world/

While this may seem annoying, it adds great layers of new secureness and performance to playing on the Server(s).

Thank you.

To the Haters: Haters gonna hate, Servers gonna serve.

To the other people: Sorry, this was the only way to make the server secure and work.

And another important point: You must have bought CubeWorld. No, this is not becuase i want your Login credentials, i got my own. It's because the Cube_ZirconRealms.exe checks for a valid CubeWorld installation, just like the default Cube.exe, thus means most ""cracked"" installations will fail. However, if you've bought CubeWorld and got the latest MSVR.dll and stuff, you should be fine and it will work in 99% of the cases :)

Then: My ""Red Clouds Bug"" was actually just dependant on the Y position... How could i be so wrong in over 2 years?

Ok, let's continue: [The sun](http://i.cubeupload.com/189KVQ.png)

The sun seems to rise in y itself really fast btw. In the morning it's really low down, then starts rising.

If you go too high, you will simply not see it.

In the morning it will also twitch at the start of it's travel when you reached it's top position.

Cool thing: 4773749500000000 is one of the positions that reverts the red GUI bug, 4780000000000000 is the exact middle. Everything under and above that gets tinted red.

Well, 9560000000000000 also is a white / default zone in the air..

One could think 1930 is white again, but it isn't.

Of, the maximum y pos is 999999999999999999999999 btw, it's a red GUI zone.

Ok, even if it's not the sky: let's talk about something else in cubeworld regarding the y position:

The VOID.

The Void is the place under cubeworld.

Normally, if you port to a good coordinate between the Void and CubeWorld, you will slowly go up, like in a elevator. You can see the same when you create a new world, enter a Server with a new seed or enter one of your worlds with a new character.

The Void itself ofc lives in the minus y coordinates.

**How does it look alike?**

Like [this](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/lolcwvoid.png)

A blue space, sometimes with twitching, black bars.

Well, the black bars will be in around the first 1 million units.

When you fall down, the y position will fall tho (like -22, -21, -20).

And the GUI is red aswell of course.

Oh, and you will sometimes [see yourself falling, if you look up](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/loolvoid.png).

And the black bars sometimes cover up the entire screen (skybox only tho).

You will fall down for likely forever until you reach the final zero.

Let's see, what will await me at the bottom.

Btw: The examine key [R] -Alert will trigger here all the time if you were right on a examine object and didn't change your x and z pos. The sky above doesn't trigger this alert at all.

At around y=-125888733958637 the [skybox will flicker with this box](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/skyboxflicker.png) for about 2 million blocks / units.

And btw: If you didn't know yet, the [sun lives in the void](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/qAtxU0.png) at night :P

The sun goes in a 360* circle from North to South btw.

[Orange sun at '20](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/RtrJmZ.png)

From around 4 to 6 am [the sun will hide in a blur](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/eVCQTC.png) (not really visible / distinguisiable from the ground blur).

A tip: When you're dead (HP = 0), you fall no further. Setting to anything above 0 again will continue the fall. This can be used for debugging.

Also: While the sky doesn't load the default terrain and minimap (empty data thx to sky's air blocks), the void does so. Well, it loads the terrain in the background, the minimap is hidden here aswell. When you want to enter the overworld (normal height) again, you might have to wait a bit for the terrain to load.

Another thing: placing bombs does work in the sky and void. [Bombs exploding in the void](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/IbX44W.png), they even explode when you attack them [Bombs in the sky](http://u.cubeupload.com/Blubbll/vWOXST.png). But in another place, other than the overworld, namely in the invisible bedrock walls (the walls in north and east), they don't work. They just vanish. Well, they're placed and saved in the memory as entities for a moment, but their explosions won't get rendered.

You can also add a nice sky texture to CubeWorld. Well, atleast to live streams and recordings so far, but it's still worth.

If you already have OBS, you can skip the next step.

First, you need to get OBS (from https://obsproject.com/download), click ""Download OBS""): [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/9I8yeH.png))

Install it and run it. You should see the application screen :  [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/XfqHBy.png)

If you want to just preview the effect for now, you don't need a streaming account yet. If you have one, and want to stream, you can do so in ""Preferences"" and then ""Broadcast Preferences"". Enter your stream platform and stream key there.

Then start CubeWorld.

In the bottom of OBS there should be 2 boxes, the second says Sources: [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/DjAbHD.png)

Rightclick it and it should say add sources: [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/kzarR6.png)

Then click ""window mode"": [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/NZCryL.png)

Then enter some name (eg CubeWorld, i left it at the default) for that window / source: [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/SmmySY.png)

Hit okay, and you should see a selection window: [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/cCyhYq.png)

Select ""Cube"" from the Dropdown menu and click ""complete window"" (or inner window, not sure yet, select the one most fitting, inner seems to be way less buggy).

Now press ""Ok"".

To preview, what you have so far, press ""Start stream preview"": [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/jcrAAC.png)

You should now see something like this: [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/qrva6x.png)

In the next step double click the window source again and activate ""use chrome key"": [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/NzNMU6.png), [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/ZvEkRx.png)

Then hit ""Select"": [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/7l1s5C.png) and with the selection tool, hit the darkest blue fog you see.

Then increase the ""similar"" value until all fog is black: [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/zpRtPN.png)

the XP value of your char might get detected aswell, you can play with the values to prevent stuff like that..

It should now look like this: [Image](http://cubeupload.com/im/8wlCja.png)
Now hit ok.

And then in sources rightclick again and add an Image: [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/S2cJmo.png)

again, enter some name (maybe day-sky) and press enter again. Now select the file: [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/iVXy74.png) and double click the file and hit ok. don't change any value in the image screen.

Then it should look like this: [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/3K2GZN.png)

Now, simply place the sky layer under the screen view. Rightclick it and set its position to ""bottom"": [Image](http://i.cubeupload.com/6m13FC.png)

And you should have skies in your Recording / Streaming! :) [Tadaa](http://i.cubeupload.com/NCvURh.png)

Another useful tool would be [cwshards](http://www.cwmods.com/downloads/info398-CubeWorldShards.html) btw to get rid of the actual fog. I would totally use it, it boosts the blue detection really a lot!

Some skies (extracted from the [Dramatic Skys](http://resourcepack.net/dramatic-skys-resource-pack/) minecraft texture/resource-pack)): [Red Sky](http://i.cubeupload.com/H5Lc5L.png), [Blue Sky](http://i.cubeupload.com/FniGYH.png), [Night Sky](http://i.cubeupload.com/IL48mX.png).

Similar ways would also work with XSplit, but i don't support XSplit too much, as i think it's way too complicated.

I didn't find any real-time programs for the normal cubeworld yet, but one could compile [Chroma Key Live](http://www.zachpoff.com/software/chroma-key-live/) for windows and make this possible, i didn't understand yet how tho.

My new host also supports auto enrolling, so i just need to mod one server for cubeworld and he will clone the hardware setup. This should make setting them up a way less painful task, like in the past.
also the seed giver will be the hub, like it should be, so no more pre-timed restarts of c1.

Edit: The HUB machine and one slave Server already works, and damn, their hardware specs are op. Just look at the uplink speed: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/173555386798964736/181411983503917057/unknown.png

First, if you don't have a backup folder yet, use this command:

    md ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Cube World\Save\character_backups""

32Bit version:

    md ""%PROGRAMFILES%\Cube World\Save\character_backups""

and then to make a backup with this command(which will get the datestamp of the day you executed the command, comment on here if you also want hour, or everything else):

    copy ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Cube World\Save\characters.db"" ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Cube World\Save\character_backups\characters_backup_from_%DATE%.db""

32 bit version:

    copy ""%PROGRAMFILES%\Cube World\Save\characters.db"" ""%PROGRAMFILES%\Cube World\Save\character_backups\characters_backup_from_%DATE%.db""

**Why an folder for this and not inside of the /Save/?**

I think this may help viewing the data, as the Save directory has too much, fluctuating data, like quests and temporal map data.

****

**How to do it?**

Simply click your Windows icon (mostly bottom left on the screen) and search for cmd.exe

Click on it or press enter, a console should pop up.

Or press the Windows Key and R and enter cmd.exe and then hit the [Enter] key or click ""execute""

Then paste the said command from above by right clicking the window and clicking ""paste"" in the context menu (or whatever ""paste"" is in your language, same as ""execute"").

Hope this works for you.

To restore these backups, simply delete the old ""characters.db"" in %PROGRAMFILES%\Cube World\Save\"" / %PROGRAMFILES%\Cube World\Save"" and copy the one from the backups folder there. Remove the datestamp and the _backup_ labels and you should get the name ""characters.db"" again.

Note that CubeWorld has to be closed during the restore procedure. For backupping it, it's better to close it, but can also be done while playing.",CubeWorld,"Simple, local character backup script.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CubeWorld/comments/4jfby1/simple_local_character_backup_script/

This is to make sure of maximum variety of missions and also ensure the stability and reliability of the servers.

If you play on the Server regularly, it may have left a few map files behind.

This little snippet should delete them all:

    del ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Cube World\Save\map_online_-7*.db""
    del ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Cube World\Save\world_online_-7*.db""

32-Bit:

    del ""%PROGRAMFILES%\Cube World\Save\map_online_-7*.db"" 
    del ""%PROGRAMFILES%\Cube World\Save\world_online_-7*.db""

Repeat the step with the second command, this may be helpful when there's some world databases cached, due to whatever reason.

The ZirconRealms Map caches should now be cleared and you should get a few mb of free space.

Hope you enjoy playing on my Servers and this helps you!

I found something cool: Having map data, but still walking on invisible bedrock.

the pos (x and z) is 1099999999999.

i can also see some missions in the far, will walk there now and see what will happen.

this is what i have so far: http://i.cubeupload.com/VbpFQV.png something i didn't reach in 3 years yet, cuz i didn't put too much time into it.

1098999999999 x 1098999999999 is working territory btw.

When you are in the invisible Bedrock, which is from zero to max, you can't walk. Just like it is until the final max value, where the world engine will also stop generating the metadata. And also at the positive end, you will see your worldshadow: http://i.cubeupload.com/fkiSGW.png

getting back into map area doesn't work, the loading indicator will come forever, the position i tried was 1099510000000 1099510000000, which is about the exact last positive block position in the world generator engine.

note that mobs can walk there tho.

also note that the cpu usage is way higher and the positive map edge than at the negative one.

The most far part one can travel without the loading screen is 1099512000000 x 1099512000000

Funny bug at this end of the world: monsters will regenerate their health, don't even bother fighting them. edit: you can kill them, if you're strong enough. otherwise they will fast heal themselves.

the positive end of the world is at north east btw.

note that you can walk onto some of the edge stone btw: http://i.cubeupload.com/vnYPVF.png

there's one chunk in both directions on which you can walk, just how the minimap glitch is made of: http://i.cubeupload.com/slS8J2.png

there are also funky structures made of invis bedrock: http://i.cubeupload.com/h07XZy.png edit: they're made of normal blocks, which can be bombed away, just invisible.

The biome can, just like the negative (or 0-corner), be any biome, but is most likely Plains. Ocean is the next likely one. Here's an ocean pic: http://i.cubeupload.com/K8hIQf.png

However, the map doesn't load here, thus would make this position cool for stuff that loads fast (maybe my Server HUB in the upcoming cubeworld update) mk.

This is to make sure a hacking attack doesn't ruin all Servers for quarter a day.

What did they do? Abuse multiple bugs that cause everybody on the Servers to get a corrupted SP save, die constantly, get tp'ed to the Zero-Corner, get stuck in a Zero-Corner Vortex (always flying up) and more.

Why does this happen?

This happens on every Cubeworld Vanilla Server, even on cuwo Servers (when entities are enabled or you just have some bad luck with your setup) thx to Wollay's sloppy coding.

What's the good thing?

You can always loot a dungeon every time you join! &lt;3

You are always with your friends and need to walk hours to get to spawn again.

Sry if this causes any inconveniences to you, but i won't switch to Glydar or any other Server distribution, because i love PvE and thing others should have a chance to play with other people aswell.

What is ZirconRealms? ZirconRealms is *the* CubeWorld PvE Server since day 1. It had over 40 thousand players so far. It currently exists of 6 Servers, which are 1- the HUB (and Seedchanger, also PlayerBanner generator, Stats Server (no IPs anymore, and everything else) and 5 Cluster-Servers to serve every player in CubeWorld, which thanks to wollays mean hype train, **get more and more by day, and even inside the week our capacities are reached**.

For only 100$/mo you can help the biggest CubeWorld Server Network maintain it's features and add a lot of new Servers to the CubeWorld Community.

You would get an extra line or advertisement sentence that fits into one line and i will put it on the Status Website (when i will ever have time to re-build it), Server Banner on Server lists (your Logo, face, whatever (Sponsored by ""Bobs Cheese-Sticks"", etc"") and in the Server HUB which currently about 90% of the total players connected through all the time (roughly, i disabled my sharp-db tracking due to privacy reasons, but the network traffic and ip connections are there at it's strongest of every server in the network currently).

Currently this service takes a sh*tload of money to maintain, which is currently paid by me by the money i still had / have laying around from former work, etc., but i am currently still unemployed, which will change in autumn tho.

Until this time i search for an supporter / sponsor.

I think CubeWorld should have advanced, high quality Servers, even after the update.

Wish special setups with own Software, scripts, injections, hardware- and software modifications of the Server OS and Memory and Thread handling i can assure the Servers are 100% optimized for the Server.exe. Atleast so far as Wollay gives us with this kinda-limited and cut Software. But you get my point i guess.

Anybody interested?

I take PSC and PayPal.

You can also send me a PM.

The .plx files have been created with the Plasma tool by Wollay.

He demos it on his companie's website: [Picroma/Plasma](https://picroma.com/plasma).

These graphics are somewhat based on vectors and - as he said - are easily scalable, which you can see in your game when you resize the game window, or well, enable fullscreen mode or change the resolution.

They can also be equipped with the tag static:disable, which i think means they won't scale fluid and will stay the same size, maybe good for specific icons. This is what seems to be used most in cubeworld, only their actual positions of their placement are fluid.

You can save apparently many elements (graphic tiles) and address them later or fill them with metadata inside an index-plx file (the interface.plx).

Plasma currently is in the work and will be released to the public soon.

Changes inside or to the attributes of the plx files are not dynamically, you need to re-launch the game to make the changes appear, they get loaded once you start the unit (the game).

There currently seem to be 5 Plasma graphics (cursor.plx, gui.plx, help.plx, quest-tag.plx and start.plx and one plasma index (interface.plx) being used in cubeworld.

Chris demoed that you can replace / rename each file and show them instead of another graphic. This doesn't work in any case tho.

You should then be able to create your own Cubeworld Resource packs by editing the GUI, Cursor and help overlay.

Well, if you use custom icons (like Winterboard) without a jailbreak (eg from http://iCustom.TooliPhone.net/), the link icons often throw false offline alerts.

This is the instruction how to disable those permanently by writing the dummy apps into the local permanent webkit cache.

When the enable Internet popup would come, enable wifi for a sec.

Until next ios update, the custom icon has the cache activated.

You need to do this for any app.

The FPS did increase a lot, same as the I/O performance, also the CPU usage did sink markedly.

Again, the IP to test it is **c4.zircon.at** and it will roll out to the whole ZirconRealms Network soon.

Enjoy!

**Edit: It has been rolled out to C3 and C2 aswell, C1 will follow later.**

Note that this all is a free project, all the many hours i put into developing stuff for my server and maintaining the last 2.7 years and all the money is by myself. If you want to donate, you can do so via a PM.

.

So, you are not jailbroken and don't want your Provider to say No SIM and you don't love the pesky Popup either?

You just use that device for photographing / Music / video or whatever?

Now this will temporary disconnect the software connection to the baseband (2G/3G/4G networks)!

Just change the time to 1970 (takes about 2 minutes) in the date and time thing.

Then you will see an image like [this](http://i.imgur.com/1EaRaH6.png).

You then will see something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/5k514c4.png).

This tells you how lively your Device's Battery is. Explanation:

Cycle count: How often you fully charged your Phone.

DesignCapacity: How much mAh (milli aphere hours) there were for this device.

FullChargeCapacity: How far you can charge your Battery.

BatteryCurrentCapacity: This is in percent (should actually show current mah, but idk why the dev put percentage here, nvm.).

Mac method should work similar, but is kinda not needed, since the mac already has all these Tools already built in (in iTunes, Mac os and shit, amiright?).

.

(Tested on iPad mini 1g iOS 8.1.2 and iPod touch 6g iOS 8.4)

.

The tweak is **fully compatible** with iOS 8.1.2 to 8.4 (I would say iOS 8 in general).

.

Anybody got an iOS 7 device? Could work on iOS 7, too since the Loader Bar is the same (white &amp; thin).

Tested on iOS 6 and it doesn't work (you get stuck at apple logo, safe mode won't trigger).

.

You can copy the .dylib + it's .plist from /Library/MobileSubtrate/DynamicLibraries/ to the older device (i did it via FTP).

You then need to **reboot** your device to see the differences.

.

Or the dev can open it for iOS 8 too and you can install it.

Welp. nice tweak.

Then download this table: http://www.filedropper.com/racechanger

Then start Cubeworld.

Next step is double clicking the racechanger table (file, it's ending is .ct). cheat engine should launch.

Click yes for the lua script (you can check what it does by opening the .ct file with any editor you want if you're curious).

Then click Select process (Top left) and choose Cube.exe

Hit yes, keep current table.

Click the boix at race bypass until the box gets a red cross.

do the same for the setting inside it and double click the value (mine was 2) and set it to 95 (Santa).

go back to cubeworld, select your character.

Now you have the Santa race until you close cubeworld (this mod only is temporary).

Another funny christmas race is 129 (Christmas tree without decorations).

This can be fun on multiplayer Servers (eg mine or others) or if you simply want to do some play as Santa.

how can you join? just like always, use cw.zircon.at to connect to multiplayer.

any benefits? you won't be load-balanced anymore and also help me reduce costs, making me positive to host my servers even longer and more.

what if the experiments breaks down like my 3/4 one powerful server last time or the 2 2/4 Servers? well, i'm going back to the 1/4 x4 cubeworld server setup (which will continue to run in the background anyways).

hope you like these experiments aswell and many players will come and help me try the new machine out.

Since everybody starts to post Servers now which don't work at all mostly or crash your game, etc, or hamachi things, i gonna present you my solution yet.

The Server is connected to a very fast connection with one of the world's fastest data lines and is hosted by OVH.

It's open 24/7 any for everybody, ecspecially low Level- players.

The Server got a few optimizations and custom services and boosts that make sure it's online all the time and (almost fully) bug-free.

It's running my custom pve setup you may know from my other 3 free and public cubeworld pve servers (cw.zircon.at).

This means, there's a 24h Seed rotation and a slightly better performance than with other servers.

Again, the Seed rotates daily at 24h UTC, which makes exploring immensively awesome.

Imagine, you can explore new lands daily and daily restart at the same position (center of the map :D) to gear up with your friends.

Here's each of them in one thread.

.

**(Rolling)Jumpstart for Gliders**

Step1: Have enough stamina

Step2: Roll using middle mouse

Step3: Press G to activate the glider whenever you like (must be fast tho)

Have fun!

.

**How to surf on a Hang Glider**

Step1: Have Hang Glider &amp; Boat

Step2: Have the required skills.

Step3: Go to water.

Step4: Activate the boat.

Step5: Replace boat in ""specials"" with your hanglider.

Have fun!

.

**How to doublejump (like in supermario)**

Step1: Have enough stamina

Step2: Do a roll (middle mouse) forwards

Step3: At the same time press space for 2 (or 3) times.

Requires a bit of practice, but the results are good, the jump width is as twice as normal.

Have fun!

.

**european players: get spaces in your / your pet's name **

Step1: Press ENTER

Step2: Use /name for yourself of /namepet for your pet

Step3: after /name or /namepet enter the desired name

Step4?: You can use the letters ü ö or e ä as spaces, eg ""My pet"" would be ""/namepet Myüpet""

and ""Indiana Jones"" as your name would be ""/name Indianaüjones"" **WARNING** max enter (with üs) is 10 letters, so make it short. anything above 10 resets your name to before you did the command (and cube.exe shuts down forced)

.

**Hope you enjoy these and have as much fun with Cube World as i do!**

this can be done by eg calling a second number you own, a friends or an invalid. the important thing is that the calling screen should appear. the sms is then unlocked for this season (until iPhone restart or until next lockup).

Alternate way: Open Phone, wait until you can call (Test calling via tapping a contact). If positive, go to the info field. Then send the person you shortcalled a sms out of the phone app and you should be in a working sms app.

Nope, you don't need an expensive threadmill.

You thought loosing calories while watching TV is impossible?

It isn't! Today i walked like 4000 Steps (Stepcounter). All while watching a few hours of TV and walkin back and forward in my room.

While that sounds stupid (and should mostly be only done when you are alone and have like atleast 4x1m space free in your (living)room), it really is a nice new way to enjoy TV while being healthy.

Walking on the same spot wasn't to good for me.

And i didn't want to go outside because it was dark &amp; late already, so i created this fitness way for myself and wanted to share it.

dividing the distance through the steps. You then get how far you walk with one step. You then have to multiply the distance with 1000 and set this as daily goal and you get the distance on the little spinner instead of steps.

Mine was 11.000 steps. So one line on the little spinner is 1 kilometers.

Now i want to start with the Korra series and i wanna buy it legally on iTunes.

Does anybody have any experience with the quality of the Korra movies on there?

I would buy Season 1&amp;2, the prices are 75€(HD) or 56€(SD) and i heard HD iTunes stuff takes a lot of place.

I didn't see any real difference, only that the HD preview was a bit more clear and vibrant.

Are there any Korra fans here that have experience with iTunes?

If so, would you recommend it to buy the series there?

Why? Why not?

Thank you in advance.

I found an easy solution for this which i use daily (jailbroken 4s with like only 10/64 gb left, SwiftKey and a lot of active jailbreak tweaky (like 15) so my performance is meh.).

First, enable AssistiveTouch.

When an app hangs up or lags, or keyboard won't come up or device feels sluggerish, just tap AssistiveTouch button and tap on ControlCenter and tap above it.

This will clear a lot of memory and you can continue with what you were doing before it lagged.

It doesn't work in **all** cases, but *should* work in most.

Hello and welcome to my first public Cubeworld modification!

It's a simple solution for the problem of the game lacking music.

The Companion i wrote manages all the things you need to get background music in Cube World.

^Trust me or not, it's up to you. Everything is transparent code-side, even the launcher code is appended. Only external tool i can't show the code of is: [RestartOnCrash](http://w-shadow.com/blog/2009/03/04/restart-on-crash/)
.

I hate viruses, paid services for nothing, (fake) surveys ,ads, spyware, maleware and all the other nasty stuff bad people do in the net.

That's why i gurantee you all of my Servers and Services are

100% Freeware, don't include any adware or anything else bad, you can even check for yourself!

[Visual basic link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4T8Tj44-vtVMjgwWTVuUUFfQ0U/edit?pli=1): Compile yourself if you still think you're right .-.

I love easy stuff that just works.

Hope you do aswell.

How to install it?

1. Download the Zip. Click here &gt; [**MusicLauncher9**]https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B4T8Tj44-vtVY0haejc5TTBEcVE&amp;export=download) or 
 click there  &gt; [**MusicLauncher9Lite** (no Music)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4T8Tj44-vtVV3QwVHV1alNKSFk/edit?pli=1) and search for a ⬇ :3

2. Copy the **mods** folder and the **launcher** application to your Cubeworld Folder. *Where?* Hit Windows + R and paste "" C:\Program Files (x86)\Cube World "" and tap enter.

3. Run it and let it magically do what it's supposed to do: Add Background music to Cube World.

 Nothing less or more.

Enjoy!

You can simply add own music by dropping it in the /mods/music folder. 
The rotator will then choose one of the files on its own.

the download would include a few mp3s already but you can dynamically add new music on your own as well.

i can only guarantee it would work on windows 7 and it needs .net 4.0 (installed on most computers)

the setup would be a bit hacky but works so far.

How it works?

1. You run the batch file / exe i compiled with visual basic that will call the cube.exe

and also a process monitoring application that will call the music if it sees the process isn't running.

it will also close the monitor itself if the cube.exe isn't running anymore.

why am i using RestartOnCrash.exe ? To ensure the monitoring works on Home Premium Versions of Windows too!

anybody interested?
