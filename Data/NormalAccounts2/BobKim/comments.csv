For me, 1000hz feels smoother, like the mouse is gliding across my screen. 500hz feels rougher, it's like I've forced the mouse to be where it is supposed to be. Because of this I prefer 500hz, but it's going to be preference for you if you cannot tell the difference. Everyone is different. If you can't tell, go with 1000hz as 500hz is 2ms and 1000hz is 1ms latency.",2016-11-07 14:09:31+00:00,d9pj9od,1,t3_5bjske,41258,MouseReview

88,"1.46 Dust 2; 1.34 Overpass; 1.20 Mirage; 0.72 Dust 2.

1.46 Dust 2: Shroud, autimatic, n0thing all got similar ratings. This results means nothing then as an individual as it shows great teamplay instead. Everyone traded frags and had great retakes.

1.34 Overpass: 1.34 ratings from a loss. That's a true superstar quality. The 1.46 from Dust 2 literally means nothing compared to this game. It shows how even when it seems like his team is doing poorly he has the mental strength to keep playing at his pace. He opened up so much so C9 that game it's crazy.

1.20 Mirage: He had a lot of great lurk frags but none of them had more impact than Stewie's frags.

0.72 Dust 2: Everyone did poorly, can't blame on 1 person except immobile Skadoodle.

Ratings don't mean everything. If you as a team stomp a team, anyone can get a good rating. It's all about impact. Against NA teams I've seen him do so much, but his international performance hasn't matched that anywhere near close. 1.3 rating from no impact except Overpass says enough. But it's still early, we'll see how he does. It's the same story with Stewie.

There are infectious and non-infectious diseases. Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. These pathogens can enter the body through the air we breathe, the food and drink we consume or through openings in the skin, such as cuts. As an example, Spongebob has a cold. Spongebob may cough into his or her hand and then touch a doorknob, thus placing the cold virus on that doorknob. The virus may die on the doorknob, but it's also possible that the next person to touch the doorknob will pick it up. If that person then touches food with the unwashed hand and consumes the food, the virus is now inside the body.
