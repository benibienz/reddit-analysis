The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.

The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
