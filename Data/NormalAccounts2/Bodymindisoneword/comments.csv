I worked at an animal hospital and I have seen some nasty shit over the 10 plus years I was there but this was the creepiest.s A good friend of mine walked in with a paper plate, he proceeded to present the plate to me which had a kitten so mangled that it looked like a limp, wet doll. There are two things I can't tolerate well, eye injuries and maggots and this poor thing had both.. her eye was hanging out, enlarged and pus yellow. 

He says to me ""Some woman was spraying the poor thing with RAID bug spray in the street and I figured maybe I could bring it here"" 

I take the plate, and gentle inform my friend he did the right thing, however this kitten was dead. 

Him: No it's not

Zombie kitten raises it head: RReeeehhhhghghghgghoowwww

I was so freaked out, I ran into the treatment room yelling ""OMG put this poor thing to sleep, put it to sleep!!!!""

I too once got on a train, for me it was dizzy, nauseous, increased heart rate and syncope. For months every time I got a train the physical symptoms came back to varying degrees. Once I realized the train ride HOME was never as difficult I knew it was more of a body mind thing than just a type of motion sickness. I also knew just thinking about it (and I thank you for this) made me feel uneasy and I realized I had the fear, of the fear of it happening again and the cycle was born. 

My sessions were body scans, gentle touch, exploration of what my body was trying to tell me, how what I was experiencing physically was connected to what I was experiencing in my life etc.. and though I too was skeptic at first after two visits it never happened again.

My very sane, non-paranormal believing SO used to see this creepy, short, troll like creature in his room in a house he lived in (only there). He said it looked like a short troll with a huge nose and giant gaping smile that would just stare at him.

He chalked it up to hallucinating, but one day I heard about a Pukwudgie and all my hair stood on end.
A Pukwudgie is a 2-or-3-foot-tall (0.61 or 0.91 m) troll-like being from the Wampanoag folklore. Pukwudgies’ features resemble those of a human, but with enlarged noses, fingers and ears. Their skin is described as being a smooth grey, and at times has been known to glow.

EDIT: Details from the SO
It felt like a year but probably wasn't. It felt like something I semi got used to. Long enough for it at least. I shared the room. My sister had a bed across from mine and my parents slept in a large bed in the middle of the room, closer to where it would appear. I can't recall, but I don't think my parents were ever in the room when I would see it And I can't remember if my sister was, but I imagine she was and was sleeping I recall times my mother popped her head in and it would be gone immediately

EDIT#2: Christ there is more. This is the most he has ever talked about it with me, and I think it's because he loves reddit, I have to admit it's kind of creeping ME out at this point. Ok
On carbon Monoxide: Three other people slept in the room, no one else would see it
On Sleep Paralysis: "" I can never agree with myself on that I felt paralyzed by fear, but I could move. I would usually stare at it for a while too scared to move afraid it would see me move then I would pull the covers up over my head""

It was NOT in a corner, but in the closet by the boiler.. he drew us a pic of the layout.

EDIT#3: Well shit. I got curious about the folklore and earlier on in the post the copypasta from Wikipedia said the folklore is Wampanoag. So I decided to look up their territory for shits and giggles.
What are the chances? We live in NYC so I thought no way will this line up.

He chalked it up to hallucinating, but one day I heard about a Pukwudgie and all my hair stood on end. 

A Pukwudgie is a 2-or-3-foot-tall (0.61 or 0.91 m) troll-like being from the Wampanoag folklore. Pukwudgies’ features resemble those of a human, but with enlarged noses, fingers and ears. Their skin is described as being a smooth grey, and at times has been known to glow.

On carbon Monoxide: Three other people slept in the room, no one else would see it

On Sleep Paralysis: "" I can never agree with myself on that
I felt paralyzed by fear, but I could move. I would usually stare at it for a while too scared to move
afraid it would see me move
then I would pull the covers up over my head""

It was NOT in a corner, but in the closet by the boiler.. he drew us a pic of the layout.

Get a DAP collar online and try it out, you can also try Clomicalm in a Kong toy.

EDIT: Do not rent a Citibike. Don't do it. It's so fucking dangerous for out of towners - please don't rent a bike, it's not faster to get around since you will have to obey street lights. 

Wear comfortable shoes

 use yellow taxis (not unmarked car services)

 follow the flow of sidewalk traffic (one side this way the other side that way) 

don't be nervous to ask for directions (most people are really nice but be mindful of who seems to be in rush and who doesn't when selecting someone)

The Met and The Museum of Natural History are amazing and HUGE so pick what you want to see and hit those up so you don't spend an entire day wandering around if you have other plans. 

I strongly suggest you eat pizza while here.. 

If there are a lot of people in your group please don't walk on a busy sidewalk holding hands? Thank you 

If you need to stop while walking, pull over (head to the nearest store wall and lean, move to the curb etc)

If you have dark hair this helps a lot - http://www.target.com/p/toppik-hair-building-fibers-black-12g/-/A-26399597?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&amp;AFID=google_pla_df&amp;CPNG=&amp;adgroup=&amp;LID=700000001170770pgs&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;location=9004345&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwmri_BRCZpaHkuIH75_IBEiQAIG0rIUGJef4jQuM-ol_G9ZZ-aAeLNiQcX9-xszX1guc0oKkaAs5c8P8HAQ&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds

It builds artificial fibers that look like hair and takes a minute to put it. 

If you are willing to lighten your hair - lightening hair expands the individual hairs, giving more coverage. 

If you want to go small for now, just try some volume building pomades. 

Your barber can also help pick a style that will help!

902,"I would get upset and since he wasn't the one behaving badly he would get defense. His defense hurt, a lot. I totally trusted him and think that he was being taken advantage of emotionally and didn't know it. I never thought he would cheat and I never doubted that he loved me.

 I stopped getting upset and starting getting logical about it. I would tell him when I thought something was inappropriate and he did make efforts to keep her at arms length for a while and became sensitive to my feelings.  

That was what made the meddler get involved. 

I never spoke to the Ex about it, actions speak louder than words and honestly I wanted her less involved, not more involved in my relationship or my life. 

I just remembered, that during this my mother died and the Ex who I could barely stand sent flowers to my house and I was, so, angry. It felt like she inserted herself into my grief without any permission. I ripped my SO a new asshole because he gave her address... this was most likely his first step into cutting ties with her bc he was pretty (very) shaken by my reaction. 

After the blow out at the party, the Ex emailed me going on and on about how much SO means to her and that his happiness is important to her and they are just friends etc.. but again it was the opposite of what I wanted so I didn't reply. 

Anywho, yes I eventually told him that I couldn't be in a relationship with him and her and that I wished it was different (I really did wish it was different) but that the 6 months of dealing with this was going to sink our relationship. He didn't have to think about it, but he was sad about it at first. He never cut ties with anyone before but he knew there was no going back and that his allowance of her calling him pet names etc..was partly to blame for it all getting so out of hand. This whole thing caused a lot of what I like to call ""Compare &amp; Despair"" to take place. I started feeling insecure about myself, would get confident again then see a doodle with hearts all over that she tagged him in on FB, get insecure again, rinse repeat. I was glad to see it end but I still feel kind of badly, I do wish it was different.

903,"Personally, this was an issue for me and my current SO. He remained friends with his ex and things about her behavior made me very uncomfortable to the degree that it was a breaking point early on into the relationship. 

Nicknames, texts, she would always talk to him in a 'baby' voice which was so annoying. No matter the size of the crowd she would find ways to pull him away and talk to him i.e. play pool with me over here - come outside and smoke with me - or simply only talk to him and turn her back to me. 

Then she started tagging him on FB photos that were inside jokes from their past together.. inviting him over to her house for dinners without me. It just got to such a point that when she called him once while I was there crying - bc her current SO dumped her and she was turning to my SO for comfort I had had enough. 

My SO is the nicest person on the planet and gets along with everyone and to be totally honest though this was one sided, meaning he never treated her in a way I was uncomfortable with he still allowed her to do so and didn't see the problem with it. 

A friend of both him, and his ex got in the middle and starting to stir shit up. She would tell me things like ""X is so much prettier than you, do you ever feel bad about it"" ""X said she really misses SO and I thought I should warn you"". It came to a head during a party he threw in which the Ex was belly dancing really provocatively and the meddling friend secretly told someone at the party that I was a bad influence and that my SO should be with Ex - so she wanted to 'get rid of me' 

Yeah he stopped talking to the Ex and the meddler after that.

It's amazing. I grill some chicken, nuke their jalapeno mac and cheese and me and my SO are happy with dinner and I know how many calories I ate. The prices are also, awesome. I go weekly now.

But my goodness, going there is like going to a circus. There is zero time to browse so you better know what you want and where it is ahead of time. The people there are a sight to behold and the conversations while you are on line (massive and very fast moving line) are outrageous. Imagine hipster x5 with a heavy dash of hippy dippy and wealth. 

It's worth it.

943,"One Saturday morning at about 10am my cat woke me up as usual. This was his routine, the moment my father would leave for work he would come to me as the substitute human until my father returned home at night. Because of this habit I would leave my door open so the cat could come in. 

I wake up and the cat is in my face, my door is more than half way open because the cat is an asshole and he really pushes it open. I check my phone and am debating when to get out of bed, and see my father walk into the kitchen from the direction of his bedroom. 

This is a man that worked 5-6 days a week from opening till closing so it's strange enough that I get out of bed right away and head to the kitchen.

1066," My Father in law works full time at a pretty low paying job, this leaves him in the grey area of making TOO much for government help and NOT ENOUGH to pay for his own insurance plan (his job doesn't offer it). I am not blind to fact that most likely there was an option for him but frankly he doesn't take care of himself and is pretty self-irresponsible.

Anyway. He contracted Pseudomonas and there were some complications. He has been in the hospital for 3 weeks and has a social worker helping him get on a sliding scale payment plan. The plan is awesome, according to the social worker once they get a diagnosis (which they now have) the emergency Medicaid will cover his medications when he leaves.

So we get the diagnosis and the plan is to send him home with a PICC and have an attendant come to the house every other day to administer the medication, at a cost of 6 thousand dollars. My in-laws don't have more than 500$ to their names at any given time. It seems, that now that there is a diagnosis they want to discharge him but the medicaid will take weeks to provide coverage leaving a gap in his care.

So the doctors suggested he is not sent home but instead to a nursing care facility for the treatment - but the nursing facility will garnish his social security and disability to recoup the 6 grand cost. His family cannot afford that, they depend on his income for rent.

He needs to the PICC meds but can't afford it, and keeping him hostage and garnishing his SS seems cruel and unusual for NY.

About 10 years ago I had a vestibulectomy. ELI5; the sensitive skin around my vagina hole hurt all the time. I was diagnosed with Vulvodynia.  Ten years ago this diagnosis was pretty mysterious, and the treatments were limited. After having this pain for more than a year, I listened to the doctor's that suggested I just get it cut off. 

The surgeon cuts off the bottom half circle of skin at the vaginal opening, to replace the skin cut off, they take skin from the INSIDE of the vagina and pull it down to cover the now gaping wound. 

Worse pain ever, was actually getting the stitches out that I (of course) was allergic to! I saw stars and blacked out. 

The surgery did NOT help btw, pelvic floor physio did. It was a long road (about another 8 months post opt) but for those who are curious eventually I was 110% better. My SO and I agree that at least he got a custom fit. I like to go over to r/vaginismus and tell all the ladies not get this procedure so I hope I am also saving vulvas  everywhere.

I am going to keep this as brief as possible. 


I loved the Tarzan book series. Loved them. 

When the latest movie was announced I was pissed... because it wasn't a plot from the book. 

I just saw it Friday and fucking loved it. FINALLY the brilliant, kind of funny and pretty savage character I fell in love with was on screen. 
People assume Tarzan is 100% about a kid being raised in the jungle but the first book is only half about that - the character is so much more than that and this film completely embraced it. 

I was delighted to see a character representation beyond the typical ""APEMAN"" that has been on the screen before.

My grandmother told me a story about an older second cousin of mine that I never met. She lived near where I live now as an adult which somehow makes this easier to picture. 

She was a young adult living on her own making jewelry (high end, not an etsy-esque hobby) which is something a lot of people in my family did. It was the early 80's at the time when someone broke into her apartment to rob her. My grandmother hinted that this villain must have had an idea of her profession and marked her. 

During the robbery she was 'hog tied', and the cord that supported her bent legs was also wrapped around her throat. So if she let her legs go limp, or struggled the cord would put force on her throat. 

She was left like that for 3 days, eventually succumbing to either being strangled by the cord or by dehydration. The cause of death was left vague but the image of it scared the shit out of me. 

My grandfather had 2 sisters. One I knew, one who died before I could meet her. One sister lived in a house right by where I went to high school again allowing em to easily picture this.

We have a training institute that standardizes and updates the training, we have mandatory CE, annual conferences, monthly conference calls are offered, an International Associations Board that governs the annually updated Code of Ethics, we are required to have practitioners insurance yadda yadda. 

I detest being in anyway being compared to some chick that took a weekend course in energy work because she is so fucking spiritual.

1225,"Alternative Medicine gets a really bad wrap from practices such as Homeopathy, Intuitive Healing, Energy Work and the like. 

The problem isn't just that there are no board based studies proving efficacy, the problem is that the organizations that train these practitioners do not any form of governing system. I am not saying they should be governed by the *government* what I am saying is that once you train to practice say, reiki, or herbalism - you are on your own. There is no standardization, no internal board of directors so these practitioners can basically do whatever they want and it's okay. 

But it's really not okay. Say you go for energy work and someone touches your boob? There is nothing you can do really except what, post on Yelp about it? Because these practices don't have mandatory CE to keep their certifications they will never evolve, what if something they are using in an Herbalism cocktail is discovered to be dangerous in high amounts by the FDA - they will never update the training because there is no standardization or internal governing entity. 

This is why there is no scientific study validating them. No Scientific Board will back these practices until they go from ""Hippy"" to something more self legitimized. No one would believe an ""internal study"" they would need backing from a University or Board entity to do a blind study and back it, but why would they?

It's a shame that this term is so broad. There are other 'alternative' therapies out there that really have their shit together. EMDR for example is now legitimized but it didn't always start out that way. Imagine for a moment 30 years ago someone said - Hey, let's shine some lights into that girls eyes  I bet it will help her get over a trauma. 

Or the Alexander Technique, Tufts did research validating it and a Nobel Prize winner for Physiology dedicated his speech to it  - but ya never heard of it huh? Sounds like some whacky Alternative medicine right?

 'Negative' emotions like anger, fear, and despair are full of information about yourself. Most of the time they started out as helpful. Fear keeps you safe but can keep you frozen in your life if it's unchecked and is perpetuated, it can be crippling. So what is making you feel unsafe? What are you afraid of really?

Anger protects you from being hurt, it's very purposeful. But if you never deal with what it's protecting you *from* it festers and drives people away. So what hurt you? Deal with that. Do you need to angry anymore? I can babble about this forever. I love the dark emotions.

1479,"Two reasons, in the early days it was very common to see fake reviews. Now that doesn't happen too often these days but as a previous manager of a service based business we took up a subscription with them (paid them to be featured etc) and saw the filter function worked great for us!!!! All the unhappy or just alright type reviews were filtered. I was sure they were authentic reviews too.. and all the happy ones weren't filtered so our score was a solid 5. 

After our business was sold to a new owner they discontinued the yelp membership, and I shit you not, positive accurate reviews disappeared from our page that had been there for a year or more, clients would tell us that they wrote a lovely review and whenever we would check it would be among-st the filtered reviews.  

We went from a 5 star to a 2.5 in 3 months after no longer paying them for featured placement. I called and called, I was told it's (the filter) is a computer algorithm but the way the algorithm was described to work defied the results in many cases. Which TBH worked out great for us when we forked over money but flipped when we stopped. 

Example, new users get filtered - positive reviews from long time yelp members were filtered and negative reviews from one time users were coming through. 



I know I sound like a conspiracy nut but I hawked our reviews for 5 years and couldn't make any sense of it. So fuck those guys. ",2016-07-11 17:37:48+00:00,d583yd3,3.0,t1_d5834b7,1100.0,AskReddit

The corporation changed EVERYTHING - and everyone hated the changes.  So naturally, the people I worked with for 11 years, who were once like family took out all their frustrations on me. 

No, you have to use the new punch in clock because that info is sent to headquarters and I am powerless to change it. No, you can't wear those adorable scrubs because we all have a uniform now, not my idea. I am sorry, the way the company determines your salary is based on your revenue, not your seniority or skill... Yes, this meeting is mandatory and you have to sign in...this meeting was not my idea and I am just doing my job. 

After about 5 months of this, out of the 25 employees I worked with not only were pissed at me but 5 of the best ones all quit the same day essentially crippling the place. After a year of this, only 8 original employees remained. 

When I quit, I literally cried for joy. As far as the 5 that were the worst to me, we still don't talk 4 years later which is shame, but fuck 'em. ",2016-06-30 13:04:13+00:00,d4tw69a,1.0,t3_4qla7z,3660.0,AskReddit

I did read however that this movie does a far better job portraying the true to form Tarzan which I am excited to see. 

By true to form I mean, greatly intelligent, bilingual, and justly savage. A man who is honorable but not merciful. Even though this story is not based on any of the books, but on a comic written years later I have never read - I am excited to see his portrayal and getting away from the origin story will be a first for Tarzan on film.

So even though my mind has changed and I agree with your points, I can't delete my rant because I want anyone who bothers to read this to see the evolution. Also bc that screenshot is still making my smile.

1648,"The internet is just an example, the overall 'out of touch' is real. 

Once you become an addict, in the case I am referencing here a heroin addict, your world becomes very small. Your prioritizes are singular - make sure you score drugs and don't get caught. Your day to day life's sole purpose is getting the means to secure your next dose. Your social circle consists of only other users with the same goals assuming you don't just end up totally alone and isolated, but either way you are totally isolated from the rest of the world. In fact, after years of abuse the addicts can hardly face themselves..what they have done to their lives and bodies. So they hide in the land of denial and delusion, any changes to that are seen as a threat including progress. 

You can't relate to 'normal' things, normal people. For example, one day when I was 18 I was crying my eyes out because I had to spend 3 grand on oral surgery and I was terrified of the cost and the pain to come - my family honestly didn't understand my fear at all and only wondered how I had so much money.. 

Insofar as the internet example, it's true. My sister has smartphone and watches youtube on it sure, but she never wanted a pc or laptop because they didn't matter to her. She doesn't know how hulu works, how netflix works, she has never used social media, types with one finger, forget about things like word and excel. 

Your survival mode is on high all the time, safety is all you need, and again safety means not getting caught and ensuring your next dose is going to be there. 

 You become so out of touch with the people and the things around you it's like being in a bubble of time itself. She hasn't seen a movie or gotten an album that has been made in years. What's familiar becomes a creature comfort - so Nirvana and Beck it is! Skinny jeans reveal how rail thin she is - so that's out.. why change your hair when you are barely holding on to recognizing yourself?

It goes much deeper, to me the internet thing is something obvious is all. Your addiction locks you in a room.. 

On a lighter note, I said to her yesterday after I realized it and was trying to keep her smiling and laughing ""OMG - you get to watch all of Game of Thrones!"" ",2016-06-29 20:26:38+00:00,d4t272n,4.0,t1_d4t12j4,1328.0,AskReddit

I love Edgar Rice Burroughs.... I loved this series. 

First hollywood destroyed John Carter of Mars (The Barsoom series) by not telling the story of the first book only... 

Now this? I was kind of hopeful for this one because it didn't get as much attention (hype) over it, I thought maybe it's barely on the radar status held some hope for me that it would be as engaging as the last half at least of the first book since there are no children in the trailer. 

I thought, maybe, this was the cannibal story arch from the books.

Nope. They just fucking made up a story. GJ. Take a CLASSIC and just rewrite it. 

This story is a classic, because it's about different worlds colliding, survival and love. 

Didn't they learn ANYTHING from Pocahontas 2!

I am so bummed. For what it's worth, the book is short and is incredible.

It helped, we improved our wait times greatly on days that were routine visits - but overall since it only took one sick or ""aggressive/afraid) patient to domino the rest of the day's appointments it wasn't worth the financial loss. 

Those ten minute 'catch up times' cost us 12 appointment slot's lost to the day's revenue. 

What did help though, in the land of animals, was the Doc would look at the appointment book the day before and insert a block out of time if a patient was coming in for a sick visit. SO if there was a vomiting dog coming in at 4pm for example, the doc would block out ten minutes or fifteen minutes after the appointment anticipating the time it would take. 

Again, revenue versus time, in the land of human medicine I imagine this is ever tougher to negotiate.

I am 32 and trying to do the right thing, but so far my support efforts aren't being met - I tried tough love but this feels futile. 

I might just PM as this develops. Thank you again for the links, I will keep calling.

I was bogey boarding. Well, more like only going out as deep as my waist and riding small waves on my tummy but in my 7 year old mind I was a pro surfer.


When I turned around and saw a wave growing, and growing, and growing. I realized I was out further and the water was up to my booby nubs (7 yr old) and I had to think fast.
I got on the board, which was a hard, thick piece of styrofoam in the shape of a surf board that my folks bought at the boardwalk.. and rode the wave. tried to ride the wave.
I remember being at the top of it, feeling a terrible panic take hold realizing ""omg, I am up so high!"" when it crashed.


The board dropped out from under me with my noodle arms clinging to it when my body caught up with it. SLAM! Knocked the wind out of me so naturally I thought I was dying. What's worse is I am under water being rolled to the shore in what felt like slow motion.
I am crying now, pretty hysterically so it's a pitiful scene as I drag this toy turned weapon against me to the shore.
I look around me for the blob of our yellow umbrella to tell my horror story to my parents (mommy) and I can't see it. I say blob here because without my glasses that's all it is. I can't see shit really.
I am now lost. Get the panic back on stage here..
You see the wave and tumbles, plus my swamp thing emergence from the water took me a bit down the beach which is clear to 33 yr old me.


But 7 yr old me was a fucking mess over it.
Eventually I found them, and eventually I told my horror story including the second chapter of being lost, and no - no one seemed to react quite like my kid brain thought they would.

2116,"Okay Ill keep the long story short. 

He was so cute! And I was, well we will say 'mature' for my age. Kissing led to snuggling, that led to.. other stuff.. so I declared that we should totally get naked. 

It pretty much ended there, bc I realized we had no clue what we were doing, and an erect penis irl was terrifying. 

We decided to just be friends that kiss. Well eventually we stopped the kissing because he was so cute, and also so shy I felt like this was hard for him and we were such good friends we stayed that way. 

He moved away (2 hours but kid distance) and I only saw him a few times a year. Thanks to AIM (aol instant messanger) we stayed close but at a distance. 

Eventually we both respectively lost our V cards and now those few times a years when I did see him were full of sexual attraction. Finally when we were both single at the same time we.. Did it! Every time he was in town we couldn't keep our hands off each other. 

When I was 25 he put his foot down, the shy kid I knew was now confident and as soon he called me I swear I could hear it in his voice, that finally we were going to be a couple. He moved back home as soon as we knew this was it. 

It will be 9 yrs this August. He was the first boy I ever saw naked, and he will also be my last.

No one was there, and I realized how terrible I was feeling so I took a bunch of benadryl and slept in another room with the window closed. ",2016-06-06 13:54:25+00:00,d3y1hwi,2.0,t1_d3y13au,696.0,AskReddit

She was inviting the guests one at a time to dance with her, and I was about 5 martinis in so there was no stopping me from this. 

I couldn't see the small dark stool in front on me so when I eagerly got up to dance with her as my in laws cheered for me I went right over the stool. It was as graceless as a fall could have been. The whole I was falling over I was confused by what the hell happened bc I didn't see the fucking thing. It must have looked pretty darn silly.

2180,"Maybe... (in Louis CK's voice) Maybe... if the pandas ate burgers instead of Bamboo * they might want to have sex?


&gt;Bamboo contains very little nutritional value so pandas must eat 12-38kg every day to meet their energy needs.

But they do branch out, with about 1% of their diet comprising other plants and even meat. While they are almost entirely vegetarian, pandas will sometimes hunt for pikas and other small rodents.

Indeed, as members of the bear family, giant pandas possess the digestive system of a carnivore, although they have evolved to depend almost entirely on bamboo.

When I turned around and saw a wave growing, and growing, and growing. I realized I was out further and the water was up to my booby nubs (7 yr old) and I had to think fast. 

I got on the board, which was a hard, thick piece of styrofoam in the shape of a surf board that my folks bought at the boardwalk.. and rode the wave. tried to ride the wave. 

I remember being at the top of it, feeling a terrible panic take hold realizing ""omg, I am up so high!"" when it crashed. 

The board dropped out from under me with my noodle arms clinging to it when my body caught up with it. SLAM! Knocked the wind out of me so naturally I thought I was dying. What's worse is I am under water being rolled to the shore in what felt like slow motion. 

I am crying now, pretty hysterically so it's a pitiful scene as I drag this toy turned weapon against me to the shore. 

I look around me for the blob of our yellow umbrella to tell my horror story to my parents (mommy) and I can't see it. I say blob here because without my glasses that's all it is. I can't see shit really. 

I am now lost. Get the panic back on stage here.. 

You see the wave and tumbles, plus my swamp thing emergence from the water took me a bit down the beach which is clear to 33 yr old me. 

But 7 yr old me was a fucking mess over it.

The burning was scary, really scary. But it just took time, and trust me having a positive attitude went a LONG way for me :D 


The theory of my PT was if the muscles are constantly clenched, they express this dysfunction with pain, and the sensitive skin of the vuvla will become inflamed. Two problems, one cause. I trusted her and I am glad I did.

""Hey I know your sister (older)""

another one joins in

""Is she still all strung out?""

It was fun, until it got removed because it had an example in the question. I understand as somewhat of a newbie to reddit that there was a time in which people could make statements, end it with a period, and then present a relevant question and that it became cumbersome thus a rule to prevent this typically, as I understand it, chance for OP to self advertise. 

I don't think my question's example cause the question to be, as defined in rule 2

10am on a Saturday morning I was in bed petting my very bossy cat, who had pushed my bedroom open a few minutes prior, when I saw my dad.
The entry to the kitchen is just that, an entrance, there is no door. I saw him in his over sized black shorts and miscellaneous old tee shirt cross the kitchen entry way. First I thought, why the fuck he is not at work then I realized that he wasn't wearing his glasses... which led me to think he must be sick.
So I get up despite my dickhead cat's nasty face and walk into the kitchen to ask him if he is feeling ok.
No one was there. No one was home, all the doors were still locked. I wasn't afraid, but turning that corner and expecting to see a person and seeing nothing but a bright empty room was very creepy.",2016-05-16 13:39:42+00:00,d37g9x4,1.0,t3_4jl4e8,1019.0,AskReddit

2461,"Ok. So I was 18 working at a veterinary hospital when one day my good friend walked in. He silently walked in, and with a poker face men would kill for proceeded to lift a paper plate, the kind you get at a pizzeria, into my view. 

On this paper plate was a very, mangled kitten. Due to the NSFW tag I will briefly describe it, this kitten was the the size of a tangerine, with so many broken bones it's limbs it looked like it was  a string puppet. It's eyes were so bulged they were yellow tinged with a film of grey on top. 

It was dead, and he found it on the street to bring in to me in hopes to do the 'right thing' or 'resolve' the situation. So I looked him in the eyes with a deep pity only kittens can warrant and said sympathetically, that it was dead. 

In that moment, in became pet cemetery. For no reason I can fathom now even as a woman that worked in this field with 11 yrs experience, there was no reason this kitten should have, could have, been alive.

2498,"For me - I can't speak for others.. The books were so good. Yeah I know everyone says that. But you have to understand the entire first book read just like Tarzan, you are engrossed in a human being an alien and winning. Which makes sense because it's the same author. Tarzan movies worked because they only did the first book. The first book of this movie was called Princess of Mars. 

Now Tarzan had many books in the series, but the films were only the first one. Mars was a combination of three.. that to me was where it failed. It was an action sci fi and not the engrossing, incredible journey of a man mysteriously being on Mars, and learning to walk again.. living in fear and awe of the gravity difference making him super human but being a prisoner to a frightening race. Then of love and heroism. 

It could have been a great series of films instead of an amalgam of the series.

So I get up despite my dickhead cat's nasty face and walk into the kitchen to ask him if he is feeling ok. 

No one was there. No one was home, all the doors were still locked. 
I wasn't afraid, but turning that corner and expecting to see a person and seeing nothing but a bright empty room was very creepy. ",2016-05-05 19:20:20+00:00,d2u6msq,1.0,t3_4i1eb7,1197.0,AskReddit

About 3 weeks into it we decided it would be best if we just remained friends (he was very shy and was a better pal than bf). 

About a year later he moved.. only 2 hours away but to a teenager that's pretty far. We only saw each other every few months at that point, then teenagers will be teenagers and eventually I started dating people. At one point around 18 or 19 he met and fell for someone and I too was in a long term relationship so we stayed friends. We starting seeing more of each other around that time as well. 

Eventually they broke up and he was dating people in a less serious capacity, I was dating lord knows who at the time... 

At 25 he called me up and told me he had to see me. He said, and this is my favorite part ""I am sick of dating people and trying to find something about them that I like, when I know what I want and it's you"". 

Rest is history as they say. He was the first, and will be the last man I see naked. ",2016-05-05 18:35:09+00:00,d2u4khh,3.0,t1_d2tyw3d,7320.0,AskReddit

She is a skilled negotiator. She is starting to gear up, part of her wants be clean - but in an ""I dream of Genie"" nose wiggle way. She sees the life past this, but not through it :( 

I am SO interested in outpatient care. Ideally she needs


Medically assisted detox. 

Therapy as frequent as possible, individual &amp; group

Workforce training or hobby programs (she needs to get out of the house and produce things for herself). 

If there is an outpatient place in NYC that takes her medicaid out there, I would be thrilled. Everywhere I call either turns us away due to her length of addiction (Columbia for example turned us away for example) or they don't take her insurance. 

She wanted - to go a luxury place in California.. but we scrape together 15-20k

I just called her and she believes that suboxone 'doesn't work' but I think that's bad advice from her two heroin pals. I hate those guys.

Thanks again for the advice.. I promise to update here when it's right. I am in awe of the responses.

2590,"Hello! Sorry for the delay. 

Somatic Psychology (body mind psychotherapy, body-oriented psychotherapy, etc.) is a holistic form of therapy that respects and utilizes the powerful connection between body, mind and spirit. How we are in this world, how we relate to ourselves and others, is not just purely about the mind or our thoughts, but is also deeply rooted in our bodies and our spirits. Unlike traditional talk therapy or cognitive therapy, Somatic Psychology tends to be more experiential.

Somatic Psychology has a long and rich history and is primarily derived from the theories and practices of Wilhelm Reich, a psychoanalyst and student of Sigmund Freud. Since that time, it has been influenced by existential, humanistic and gestalt psychology, dance, movement and art therapy, family and systems theory, biology, neurology, and Far Eastern philosophy and spirituality.

Individuals seek this form of treatment for similar reasons they might look to more traditional therapy—to address stress, anxiety, depression, relationship and sexuality issues, grief and loss, addictions, trauma including abuse recovery, as well as more purely medical reasons including pain, headaches, and chronic fatigue syndrome.

Now that I have bored you - come back to me for a moment!!!! 
I hope I didn't lose you!!! 

There are many modalities (kinds of therapeutic methods) under the umbrella of somatic psychology, some are more legitimate than others... I won't lie. I would be honored to help you find a professional in your area if you are willing to let me look. 

I just need a round about of where in the world you are. I am here, and I am happy to help. ",2016-05-02 22:07:33+00:00,d2q83k3,,t1_d2p7cw9,69090.0,vaginismus

The five deaths over the summer that may have some legitimacy are still subjective to, probability. 

&gt;As of March 2015, there was an estimated range of 897,000 to just over 1,000,000 doctors in the United States, and per every 100,000 people (of all vocations) each year, approximately 821 die. Going by those numbers alone, between 6,500 and 8,200 medical doctors will statistically die of myriad causes in any given year. Each month approximately 700 doctors would die (based upon the number of American doctors and the number of overall deaths), thirteen of whom could be expected to live in Florida before accounting for rate fluctuations based on whether a state (like Florida) is exceptionally populous. As such, six to eight deaths is well within the realm of expected doctor deaths.

Then I heard it. It was loud and something I had never heard before. I was terrified. 

The neighbors house had a lot of damage on the roof but the damage to my grandparent's house was very minimal.

2666,"Hey there. Good on you for asking about this here. Obviously you are taking this seriously and are also reaching out in any way you can, I hear you and thanks for speaking about this. I wager more people will reply here as well.  

My 'suffering' and I don't use that word lightly, happened after an active sex life and hit me after a failed engagement. I stayed too long. Sex became repulsive and I was afraid to leave. 

Suddenly a huge part of me that I was 110% active in was taken away from me. The perspective changed and my system adjusted to the change, it was branded into me. So it's hard to relate the status of your situation given you were both virgins. 

You are not alone. I wish there was a sub for men in love with women that suffer dyspareunia and have conditions that make sex near impossible. I know, my SO, approached me with full intentions to be together and for about a year I refused him bc of this. We were also best friends. I remember telling him that I was awesome lol and that I wanted to orbit him but I had this 'thing'. This caveat. This grave disparity. 

He was so afraid to hurt me. We had such magnetism and were made to 'fit' together. It was an issue, not just for me - the one with the broken vaj.. he was terrified of hurting me let alone trying to enjoy it. 

I can't say that we lost the lust to be honest. That I cannot contend with, it was bigger than us both. 

 But I can answer your arching question here. I got physical therapy and I went to a somatic psychologist and made huge bounds back to my new sexulality. Yeah it was new, but now I am boundless. I am better than I was. 

So yeah. It took a year for me. Active healing, I 'suffered' for 3 years overall.

 It took Physical therapy and Somatic psychology. That was my bag, many others beautifully found other solutions that worked and they vary, we are all unique beings - but let me tell you this. 

It was worth it 100 fold. After the first year we were together - I came back with a vengeance lol. It's been 8 years of mind blowing sex, and still, he checks in with me to see if what we are doing specifically is ok. So yeah, it broke him in a way. I want this aspect to have more attention. He was nearly conditioned that sex was painful, in fact near evil for him to execute.

We do everything now no problemo. But day to day and time to time it changes like all good things do, and he still stops and says ""is this ok"" and I see it in his gorgeous face, the sincerity in those moments, that his number one priority is relieving his fear that he MIGHT be hurting me.  

So yeah. You are affected. That's true. 
Insofar as your relationship, you are seeking the right counseling. She needs to tend to her body and her mind. Username checks out. So to you my brethren, I get it.  

I can try to help. PM me.

EDIT: This is literally an episode in season 6 
&gt;With a full day of using, and the stress of deceiving all her friends and almost killing a patient, Jackie is ready to cut loose at Kevin and Mia’s wedding. At the reception, Jackie’s favorite drug dealer — and wedding date — Gabe arrives. When Grace sees Gabe, she immediately recognizes him as the drug dealer who sold her friend Mandy drugs at a party. Grace is shocked to see Jackie happily welcome him with a kiss. After calling Zoey in hysterics (and, I’m assuming, blowing the whistle on Jackie), Grace confronts the happy, high couple on the dance floor. Jackie introduces Gabe as her friend, and Grace responds with, “Yeah, we’ve met.” She then calls him out for selling Mandy drugs, and Jackie flips out to learn that he sells drugs to kids: “She doesn’t look 15!”
Gabe defends himself. As they continue to loudly argue and the fight escalates, Jackie pushes Gabe into a table, and Kevin eventually throws both of them out. Nothing like seeing your mom get thrown out of your dad’s wedding for going fisticuffs with her drug dealer/date to make you sign up for the “eternity” option on your therapy schedule.",2016-04-26 14:12:44+00:00,d2hwysy,2.0,t1_d2hw24p,1363.0,AskReddit

&gt;Psychologists have speculated that members of Generation Y may have a hard time thinking for themselves and feeling like adults. The demolition of their young dreams by low-paying jobs, skyrocketing tuition costs, and diminished value of college degrees, have left many of them depressed. Colleges are reporting a significant uptick in depression cases in recent years with suicide being a leading cause of death among students.

&gt;Millennials are coming of age at a time when they will be forced to deal with serious problems in the country, including an economy that still recovering from recession. Those seeking work will find shortage of good-paying white and blue-collar jobs. Most likely, Gen-Y will never enjoy the standard of living that their parents did and they will struggle to put money away and secure their future. Ironically, while millions of Millennials are still living with their parents, others appear to have grabbed the brass ring.

Obligatory that is so sweet! Okay since we have no hx to go on... there is a chance that her pelvic floor muscles are habitually tight. That tightness is expressed through an inflammatory response. It's just a chance... there is a HUGE difference between tight, sensational interpretation and dysfunction. This kind of Dysfunction is born of habituated holding patterns and I have no way of knowing if this is the case without any hx. 

I am curious if she uses tampons, and/or enjoys being fingered pain free. That's a big insight into the realm of dysfunction. 

Generally, accepting a penis is a big job lol.. I should have made a throwaway for this... hindsight 20/20. 

If her muscles are tight the sensitivity of the vagina can be misinterpreted as pain. Orgasms are essentially a gentle build up of pain and a sudden release of endorphins.. to put it in perspective. The perspective itself is up for interpretation. 

Given that you have joyful sex with booze that is an insight that her muscle relaxation is important to her acceptance of penetration. 

I can't stress enough that this not a mental perspective, I am doubtless that she wants to feel good, it is a body, mind emotional one. If you both took each other's virginity than I gather that kind of connection is already present.. that's how you can ease into pain-free sex. 

Be her pal, be her confidant even when it feels like pain with no pressure to perform. Above all, keep your eye on this - sex is fun. Have fun. Take your time, and communicate what feels 'right and good'

2752,"Hey dude. Here is my personal insight. 

Booze relaxes muscles... big time. So if the evidence points to booze helping the level of pleasure it's likely that muscle relaxation is important for her body. 

Please do not tell her to relax. Trust me, not a good idea. That sentiment will make her feel defensive....rightfully. Sex is not just physical, it's mind, body and emotional. Any kind of intimacy is.  

what I would do.. is have a loving, sexy talk about how to help ease her pangs and help her really relax into it. Turn foreplay into a massage, a foot rub, extend the teasing and above of LAUGH. Make it fun and as casual and as accepting as you can. Throw her favorite tunes on and put in the emotional and intentional effort to open her heart (the gateway to the vajj). Be friends, sexy friends. 

Then go slow, bring in a water based lube and have fun. I wager it have the same effect as booze does. 

If she has a history of sexual pain that you are aware of feel free to PM about pain during sex. 

gl and ENJOY

2759,"Obligatory suggestion to see a gyno, I looked for a gyno that dealt with pelvic floor dysfunction because going in I was confident that the doctor was well aware of this condition and had experience diagnosing it and treating it.. treatment options vary and different ones are successful for individuals but they are all by prescription and referrals. 


In my personal and very honest opinion... 
I would take control of this situation and not combine testing out pain with piv with feeling sexually excited. Once sex and pain are associated it's harder to dissociate them and that's a slippery slope. 

While I have no idea if you have vaginismus, if you are afraid of piv hurting it's a good idea to gently and with 'self kindness' (as in don't force it and beat yourself up) explore your vagina's ability to relax and expand on your own. 

Think of something that makes you feel totally relaxed and safe and do it. For me it's my pj's, bed, and nature documentaries. For you it could be relaxing music in a sitting room. Whatever it is this is the kind of environment that you want to be in when you begin to let your body relax. 

Get water based alcohol free lube and a set of dilators. It's important to approach using them as a no-big-deal activity and NOT as masturbation. It's no big deal, let your mind be easeful when you start with the smallest. If the smallest is ok then STOP. 

Go have a fun day!!! Take a break!!! If you try to go as 'big' as you can in one day you run the risk of introducing soreness and pelvic floor fatigue and that will convolute your progress. *and remember it's no-big-deal*

Then try the next bigger one the next day after relaxing. Focus on your breathing and putting your mind at ease. 

To work on improving your pelvic floor which is a long process and that's ok - when you have a dilator in, kegel, hold, and return to ABSOLUTE rest tone. This will educate the synergy btwn your body and mind on what being relaxed down there actually feels like. 

There is my crash course suggestion. And to answer you directly, yes it's worth it. I got my sex life back pain-free and 10/10 it's worth it! 

EDIT: When returned in absolute rest tone, imagine making a fist and letting your hand go totally limp. In fact try doing to establish the sensation of tightening and then letting go completely. GL",2016-04-22 19:46:05+00:00,d2dgq4z,1.0,t3_4fzsgb,4714.0,vaginismus

Make sure there are snacks and chip ins for pizza, booze and empty stomachs means someone is going to puke (hopefully in your toilet..)


Where ever your trash and recycling bins are, move them to a place with high visibility. This will save you so much time cleaning up the next day. 

Be prepared and very vocal that people can crash if they are too drunk to go home. 

We use my computer for music and it can't be BLASTING loud at 1am. So I turned the computers volume down almost all the way and leave the volume control for my speakers (external) in plain sight. People (drunk and high) will turn the speakers all the way up but secretly I know it will only get so loud.. 

Have plenty of paper towels on hand.. you will need all of them. I also keep resolve stain remover around bc I have light rugs and the party is not worth the 9 x 11 foot rug being wrecked.

 It started out beautifully.

Everyone would say things such as ""we are so happy you are here"" ""you are amazing at what you do"" etc.. my colleges often sought me out for sessions (therapeutic). 

Then one day everything changed and I don't know why. No more friendly talking, no more socializing.. and then the sessions dropped off and I was let go. The owner told me just a couple of weeks prior that when his wife was having an issue he told her out of everyone he employed that I was the person to see.. Then all of sudden I was a ghost, and I don't know why.

3087,"One night my cousin (we will call him Tom) went to sleep with his 4 year old son and Tom never woke up. He was 34 years old. 

His mother (we will call her Sue) and he were literally - best friends. In every sense of the word. Tom's dad died in 9/11 and ever since Sue and Him only had each other until Tom had a son of his own. 

I have never seen or heard a human act and sound the way she did in the morgue over Tom's body. 

The whole family was terrified of her, she was so fragile and in a despair that no one could see inside of, so naturally when she refused to let them do an autopsy (she put it differently...) everyone was supportive. 

This was 3 years ago and Sue has never healed and I doubt she ever will. She hasn't worked (well she did for about 2 months but it was too much for her) she spent a short period of time (6 months) taking Xanax regularly and goes to his grave once a month. She has not listened to anyone's advice to seek counseling or attend group meetings.. 

Now don't get me wrong she smiles, and she will seem fine at times but then she stares off at nothing and sometimes she just disappears to her room without a word and will stay tucked away. It's as though for a moment she forgot Tom was gone, then she remembers, over and over and over again. 

I host Holidays now and we treat them much more like a general party than a themed holiday because it's the worst time of year for her. I also force my Husband to get bi-annual wellness visits since then. 

A part of me wishes we knew what happened, and I think Sue does too now.  ",2016-04-11 13:27:19+00:00,d1yehoh,1.0,t3_4eahkx,3324.0,AskReddit

I knew my SO was going to go drive the ATV too fast bc it was his last go on it, lose control and get hurt. I warned him btw.. 

We were riding an ATV all day at a house we rented upstate. As we are packing up our things (we went there with another couple) my SO says to me, ""Hey, I am going to take more trip out on the ATV - wanna come?"" I got this terrible feeling, suddenly it felt as if I was removed from myself and I was watching us both in what felt like a moment that was going to change things.  

Since I got a bad feeling I told him ""Hey, I have a bad feeling (honesty), I dunno. My arms are sore from riding it all day yesterday and I don't feel like I could control it, I don't trust it today""

SO says ok, he'll go out alone. Before he left I cautioned him not to go too fast just bc it was his last ride on it and to be careful.

So when my in laws announced that they were making an hour and a half drive to see a 'legit psychic' I took the chance. 

I want to be clear here on a few things. 


1- This person did not know my name until the 'session' with him started. 

2- I did not expect him to be so normal, or live so comfortably. 

3- I spoke very little and was cautious of revealing things about myself. 

It was freaky. 

He knew I lived with my SO and that we were very happy. He knew I recently changed careers and spoke directly about the field I was going into. 

Without any incentive he looked and me and said ""you have to forgive your mother, she wasn't well"" My mom died of an overdose - Please remember I told him nothing. 

He zoned in on a diamond ring I was wearing and asked me who gave it me, my grandmother gave it to me. He then said ""but where is the bracelet? You're grandmother is really not happy about what happened to the bracelet"" My sister was given the bracelet which at that time was in a pawn shop. 

He relayed a joke my grandmother made at my deceased mother's expense (she hated my mother). 

I left in awe of this man and what happened. In the car on the way home one of my in-laws was talking about her experience and said that he asked her if she ever thought about the baby girl she was supposed to have, and assured her of some other details about this baby girl - my in law had an abortion when she was young and maybe a handful of people know about it.

3224,"Sleeping at my grandparents.. 

This was my parents way of dumping me off for a weekend so they could party, or argue, most likely both. 

My grandparents had no clue what to do with me, and didn't like children. The phrase ""children are to be seen not heard"" comes to mind. No TV - that was a no go so I spent my time essentially hiding from them in the basement or outside trying to find things to do with my time dreading when we had to spend time eating together. Awkward situations like that with your 'family' was not easy and I had no idea why it was that way at the time so I thought they were always mad at me. 

Then came bedtime!!! Two hours earlier than I was used to in a creep as fuck room in the basement which had nothing but a bed and odd old stuffed toys in it. I was petrified of that room so I left the light on the whole night. 

The joy. It felt like being hauled off for prison 2 days at time, every time. ",2016-03-29 13:41:25+00:00,d1hmwac,1.0,t3_4cf719,4400.0,AskReddit

I read the comments and it seems like your SO is afraid of driving, which is pretty big. What does she need to take the first few steps? Has she taken them in the past? How could that situation have been improve for her? 

Also, if therapy is affordable she needs to try it. There are tons of medications out there and while I personally lean to talk and experiential therapy (there are so many kinds of therapies) over meds I respect that for some people it's a chemical issue that needs to be directly treated, and finding the right meds or mixture of meds takes time. 

I hear your frustration, but understand she literally is experiencing the world differently than you. It's ultimately her choice if she tries to seek professional help though if it's effecting your family day-to-day I hope she gets on board with trying to feel better.

now you relax it a bit so it's not 100% clenched but still a fist. You are at 70% clenching. 

You have to fight like this. Make your strike, over and over and over. Even between strikes your fist never relaxes..  

It's exhausting. It's dysfunctional. You're still fighting and never relaxing, your heart is racing, you feel trapped. 

OR 

You are fine!!! You take a run for a block at your own pace and then rest, now you want to go further next time. You sleep well, wake up and do it again, this time for 2 blocks. Woo!

Do not define yourself by your job. Jobs are temporary are interchangeable, you are so much more than that. 

FAILURE and REJECTION HAPPENS 
No one successful talks about how many times they failed, but they all have the only difference is they kept trying. 

Here is a quote that sums it up! 

""Hundreds of experts have written thousands of books on how to handle rejection. I’ve read a few, and from what I can tell, they all say the same thing – rejection is a necessary stop on the road to happiness and success. Personally, I believe this is true. But I know for a fact that rejection is also a necessary stop on the road to failure and despair. Seems to me that rejection is a reality in everyone’s life, but it’s a reality with no inherent power beyond the power we give it.""

That being said, that white wash sort of statement applies to the general population but if we get closer - as in with my friends and people I care deeply about, I just listen with my heart.


I didn't always feel this way but this is the kind of person I want to be. I met a few people in my teens and early twenties that were such good listeners, that people instantly liked, that made feel like I really mattered and more so than anything else - these people seemed to be happy. 


I wanted to be like that, I wanted to feel like that. 
That's really the *why* There is a huge difference between hearing someone and really listening to them. I wanted to be a good listener and make real connections with people. 


*how* is going to be different for everyone. But if people are reading this post to try and learn to better listeners, here are some things I have learned that now come naturally to me. 


Besides just hearing the words and being able to follow a topic.. 


Be ~Authentic~ 
People can tell when you are being fake, even when you are listening and not talking,  you are not the only one with a bull shit radar. Look them in eyes and.. be present. 

 
The hardest part is to open your heart. By this I mean allow yourself to genuinely give a shit - this person is someone's mom, someone's kid, somebody in the world loves this person - they deserve to be cared about.


Listen to the words, and the *tone* of their voice
Tone of voice is so important for you to understand how they are feeling and without that, empathy won't come naturally. 


Pay attention to their body language
Are they slumped down and looking up at you? Are their shoulders back, and chest out? Like tone of voice this will also help you understand how they are feeling as they are talking to you. 


Take what you observed, and embody it (pretend you are them)
You give a shit about yourself right? Take in that tone of voice, that body language and *feeeeeel it* 

Stop and think for a second, this second of silence gives them affirmation that you are really listening. 

I spent way too much time on this lol. I guess it's bc I just like people and I like listening.

3757,"I was the one that got away. 

We dated at 13 - no joke. We decided to be friends instead bc we were kids it was too much. He moved, we dated people, he wanted me to come over to jam on a Stones song one time when we were 15 and thought he would woo me but I, being an idiot, brought my new boyfriend along. Whoops.

A couple of years later he and I were in serious relationships.. which sucked. Because I was so excited when he came over at 17-18 but this time he was the one to bring his girl friend along.. and she was *hot*

We jammed randomly over the years. We always had a connection. Then for a brief moment we were single at the same time at 22 yrs old.. he threw me a karaoke party and thought ""THIS IS IT - I AM READY"" - but I was being intensely courted from someone in my close circle of friends and at this point the mythical *him* lived 2 hours away and I never had a relationship in which we didn't see each other frequently.. while it crossed my heart to be with him, it really didn't cross my mind. 

That night I told him that I was going to be with the person in my close circle of friends, and that we wouldn't work with the 2 hours travel and full time jobs realistically. And he said ""I would have given you everything"" - we didn't speak for two years... the longest we ever went with not even speaking. 

I got a call at 24 (right before 25) 

Apparently he decided one day, that it was time, and told me flat out that he was there, and wanted to be with me - so come over. I swear there was something in his voice, on the other end of the phone that hit me to my core.. I heard his voice and literally dropped to my knees behind a table lol. 

The first thing his best friend said to me was ""Ah the one that got away""

I was alone in my apartment and I decided to take a shower. I locked the door out of habit; it can only be locked and unlocked from the inside. My clean and dirty clothes are thrown on the floor of the bathroom in two separate piles.
When I finished taking the shower, my clothes, both dirty and clean, were neatly folded in two separate stacks on the floor. The door was still locked. I take very quick showers. This happened in the span of five minutes. I have no explanation and I get goosebumps just thinking about it.
This happened about a week ago and nothing like it has happened prior or since.

There are cases like this perceptual adaptation, auditory and sensory adaptation you can look into if you are interested.

4068,"The first few months were so weird. He hadn't been arrested, and I had an inside track to what was being uncovered in the investigation bc my bestie grew up with Mary so their mother's were very close. 

At first we all thought, omg Trevor must be devastated we have to support him.. he was so weird afterwards. He didn't cry, he just wanted to reminisce about high school and his early 20's. It was creepy. Then the master's degree lie came out, and then his compulsive spending and we were informed to cut off all communication with him. One time, my bestie's SO (poor fucking guy) was asked by the detectives to meet with Trevor and then tell them how he seemed. He later had to testify to the strange, emotionless and detached attitude Trevor had. Then they made the arrest. People were crawling out from the wood works of our HS defending or condemning him. 

The then hooker stuff came out and we knew without a shadow of a doubt.

Dumb fuck (sorry to be vulgar but fuck this guy). 
BACKSTORY
He was the class clown. He was part of my group of friends, the victim was a good friend of my best friend (still besties at 32). Let's call him Trevor because I hate that name, and her Mary bc she was saint. 
My best friend introduced them and Mary started to hang around our group. But we drank and some people also smoked pot and Mary didn't but being the saint she was never judged. 
They started dating and this was surprising bc we thought she was kind of out of his league in more ways than one. He cleaned his act up, stopped drinking &amp; smoking weed and started to get good grades etc.. 
They got married and I had been to their place only a few times but given that she and my bestie were still tight we were FB friends so I would see the Disney pics and the self motivational memes and the new diet and the fund raisers etc.. 

On a Sunday afternoon her body was found in her home at the bottom of the stairs. It looked like a break in. 
He called my bestie and her long time SO, they spent the night with him. He stayed at Mary's parents house for a couple of days then moved in with mother since the house was a crime scene. 

It never crossed our minds until the investigation started. 

The investigation revealed some insane findings. It was like he was leading another life. Mary paid for him to get his Master's which he said he did.. but he didn't. He was seeing a prostitute regularly. His internet search history four moths prior to the 'break in' included ""how to destroy DNA evidence"" and ""how to slit a throat"". 
His alibi crumbled and this is the real story. 

She confronted him about the hookers and the fake master's degree. She confronted him about separating and him needing to get professional help. He threw her down the stairs, stabbed her in the back, neck and back of the head and left her dead. Staged a robbery (nothing was taken) and went to a mall parking lot, had sex with the hooker (who testified) and drove around killing time before returning home to 'find' the body. 

Fucking surreal, I bet this same guy 5 bucks to eat a slice of pizza in one bite and he did it. people change.. ",2016-02-23 14:41:29+00:00,d0alipt,3.0,t1_d0aky1q,1035.0,AskReddit

So he is wearing black trunks, a black tank top (wife beater) and has on black water shoes (he had no idea if the beach would be shelly in the water). He also put a snorkel one. 

And his sister says to me ""oh man here comes scuba Steve"" and I hold it together just for long enough to stare at her and say ""that's the funniest thing, you have ever said"".

4143,"Awakenings. 
I can't do the fancy black box/white text thing so.. SPOILERS 


Based on a true story from the 60's. 
Robin Williams plays a doctor that works with catatonic patients. These people have been in a catatonic state for years, up to decades. He administers a drug used for Parkinson's in an attempt to improve their motor &amp; cognitive skills. 

They wake the fuck up. As if nothing is wrong with them. It's beautiful and sad. We closely follow a character played by Robert De Niro as he learns to drive, meets a girl, and becomes friends with Robin Williams. 

Until the effects wear off.. and they all slowly, in detail,completely aware of what's happening - fall back into catatonic states. 
EDIT: Btw I had no idea what I was watching and thought it was Patch Addams... WRONG!

4144,"I went to an interview about two years ago for a chiropractic office. I walk in and there are about 8 people in the waiting area holding clip boards. It was a group interview, which I had never experienced before. The Chiro ran the group interview like an infomercial promoting himself at first, then it took a turn for the worse and felt more like a competition. 

I got the second interview and was hard up for cash so I entertained it despite the impression I received initially. I get into his office and am relieved it's just a one-on-one. He hands me a note pad and starts giving me basic multiplication/divisions equations. THIS JOB DIDN'T REQUIRE ANY MATH. He said ""this is just to see how smart you are"". I did the stupid math. 
Then he informs me that he wants me to 'spearhead' his online marketing, redo his website ans promote on groupon. I see where I would be working. 

It literally looked like this.

We lived in a rather large apartment, me, her, my sister and my father and needless to say I was home as little as possible, when I was home I avoided her like the plague. 

She would often help herself to anything that wasn't hers so on a Friday when I couldn't find my favorite shirt I knew where to look. I was met with the usual ""I dunno, I don't have it"" as I pulled it out from her dresser drawer. I turned around to scold her and she looked like shit. Even for her. I was pissed and when I saw her sitting on the edge of her bed there was a bit of anger in her eyes too but my anger was replaced with shock. 

She growled ""I didn't take that, leave me alone I don't feel good"". 

Ah the times I had heard that over the years.. and here the point of my post. 

I said, ""you are always sick, something is always wrong with you - what are you dying this time?""

4245,"Your story is such an innocent mistake, don't let her get you down, being happy is all that matters. Now, here is a story for you. 

I went to guitar center with my current SO to look at strings or something. I was nervous because I was acutely aware that my Ex worked there, and may still work there. You see, this ex hated me. Irrationally so but none the less he hated me very deeply. He broke up with me and I was hurt but moved on, the moving on part I don't think he factored into the whole thing to put it briefly. 

I tell my SO who has known me since we were 13 'i think ex works here, i hope we don't see him'. He thinks it's ridiculous and he is 100% right, because me and ex ended and I am not kidding 8 years prior. I know he right but he doesn't really understand how much ex hates me and how capable ex is of holding grudges. 

We don't see him, thank goodness. I am relived as we head into Target next door. Feeling free I start looking at something in the clothing section and guess who I see? Ex is there in his guitar store shirt, I guess he just got out of work and popped into target.. 

So naturally I duck like a ten year old playing tag. I am ducked behind a rack of clothes and my SO sees this, tells me to just walk next to the aisle where EX is but suggests I can just stay concealed behind the clothing racks while we make our exit. So we do our little dance, ex is in the aisle looking at shirts, I am on the other side of the aisle walking sort of like a crab walking forward, and my SO is getting a little too much enjoyment out of the scene. 

There is a break in my cover so I hesitate, it's directly across from ex so I have to be timely. Just as I start to make my move, my SO ever to gently yet suddenly bumps me into the aisle, right next to ex in plain sight. I am still bent down like a crab, am startled and just look up with sauce pan pupils at my surprised and still so hateful ex.. ""umm hi?"" If looks could kill my ghost would be typing. 

My SO just says loudly and happy with a huge grin on his face ""Hey Ex how's it going man!"" He just glared at him and my So just said ""Still? Really?.. ok"" and we walked out. 

I took every ounce of strength I had left to wait until we were outside to let the waves of laughter erupt. Yeah it was embarrassing but also laughable.

Jenny was in my life bc her SO went to high school with my SO's best buddy would we will call Trevor. They broke up eventually thank god, but she stayed friend's with him so she was unavoidable as my SO and his best buddy Trevor were roommates when we started dating and she was just there a lot. Here are somethings about Jenny. 

Jenny would cheat on trevor all the time when they lived together. When she would get caught she would kick him out even though he was the sole provider for the apt and the lease was under his name. 

Jenny somehow convinced Trevor to taker her back and that she would never cheat again until she did. He caught her and while yelling at her she hit him, hid, called the cops and had him thrown out and nearly arrested bc she claimed he hit *her*. 

Jenny got Trevor into Cocaine. 

When I started dating my SO Jenny wanted to be my buddy very badly, almost obsessively. My SO warned me about her. I went along with it until she starting asking me if knew that I wasn't nearly as pretty as my SO ex. I stomached it and avoided her. BAD IDEA. Jenny doesn't like being avoided. 

At my SO's birthday party he said Trevor could invite her but ONLY if she refrained from drug use since his little sister was coming (17) and he didn't want that shit around her. Jenny was so high and did lines in plain sight. 

Jenny told all the guests that I was bad for my SO and that they needed to hatch a plan to break us up. 

My SO confronted her about this, and she punched him in the face. I am not kidding.

I recently read something that Mike Rowe wrote about failing. Here is an excerpt that I hope entices you to read the full story. 

""Hundreds of experts have written thousands of books on how to handle rejection. I’ve read a few, and from what I can tell, they all say the same thing – rejection is a necessary stop on the road to happiness and success. Personally, I believe this is true. But I know for a fact that rejection is also a necessary stop on the road to failure and despair. Seems to me that rejection is a reality in everyone’s life, but it’s a reality with no inherent power beyond the power we give it.""

I saw my dad in the kitchen head to the fridge one Saturday morning. He crossed the open doorway that led from his room to the kitchen. It was late in the morning and he usually was at work so it struck me as odd. I looked at my clock, it was 10:30am and he typically headed to work at 8am. So I got up and said ""hey dad what are you doing home"" and the kitchen was empty. I went into his bedroom and he wasn't there. I was home alone with the cat.
It wasn't scary, but I was wide awake sitting in bed with the cat petting his noisy cat ass and I swear I saw him in the kitchen.

Degenerative diseases and vascular issues are pretty high on the list and they don't trend with aggressive behavior. 

Unfortunately this interpretation maybe skewed, which I say from experience. Dog owners that DO NOT as opposed to owners that DO tend to not be as vigilant on veterinary care. Not to say you are not vigilant, but yeah it's the case most of the time and that info may have skewed the 14% longevity increase in neutered males.

But anytime she was corrected, made a mistake, complained, or was written up the go to was ""stress"". She looooooved the HR department . 

Anyway. One day, she was asked if she would stay on for the next shift and she FAKE FAINTED. It was comical. Unbeknownst to her I faint about 3-5 times a year if my vagus nerve gets irritated and understand all the possible stages of pre-syncope and syncope since my doctor insists I be informed of these symptoms to avoid hurting myself if fainting should occur and can take active steps to stave it off.

4494,"It's hard to choose. Probably how he became successful. My grandfather worked for his dad at a textile/quilting factory in downtown Brooklyn after coming back from the war as a medic (terrified of blood but that's another story). 

When he was courting my very fancy, well-to-do grandmother he would meet her in the city for lunch in his work clothes which consisted of army boots and overalls. She would make him go into diner first, wait a few minutes and then sit with him because his outfit was kind of homely for Fifth Ave NYC diners, and she was embarrassed. 

He had a plan though and saved up his money from the factory. My grandfather (in his 20's) started making trips to Europe to look at car models that were not available in the US. He learned this while being stationed in EU that there are car models not available in the US there, and the dollar was strong at the time. He would find say a jaguar model that you couldn't get in the US and have the car shipped back here. He would literally drive the car around in nice neighborhoods and say ""Hey, do you like this car? Wanna buy it, it's one of  kind""? This was before cash deals over 5k had to be reported, so it was all cash. Since the cars were ""exclusive"" he would charge a decent amount for these ""one of a kind"" cars. 

He could sell a ketchup Popsicle to a woman in white gloves in July.

He opened up one dealership selling these exclusive car models, then started selling Honda's as soon as they started making cars (they used to only make motorcycles). At the time gas was cheap, but not for long and these little civics were affordable and had great mileage. There was one point that they had a 3 month waiting list. 
He ended up with 4 dealerships. 

Needless to say he gave my grandmother a long, wonderful life and she was proud of him endlessly.  ",2016-02-08 17:25:27+00:00,czsdyeo,1.0,t3_44rqfz,2467.0,AskReddit

There is a Spanish woman loudly and joyfully greeting  everyone at the train exit/entrance and handing them fliers, ""Hey! Good morning it's great to be alive huh?! Happy Friday to ya sir! etc"". 

To my right is a street performer on a bike doing spinning tricks for a crowd, the farmer's market in eye shot just past him, and the place is calmly bustling. Yeah I know that's a contradiction but it was true. 

Here is what I wish I had a picture of. There are always Hare Krishna's singing here, they have a rug and two benches that they claim (picture below of this exact spot and them). As I am walking I see, a Hare Krishna sitting on the bench, crossed legged. He is white approx 27-30, shaved clean head and probably stoned as a mother fucker. He is eating a cupcake, with the BIGGEST shit eating grin on his face. It was as if ""enlightenment"" was him, this one dude, happy as a clam, stoned, eating this cupcake and it put me is the best god damn mood ever. 

I love NYC

First it's just. 
""I am going to be cute to get what I want""

to 

""I am old give me or do what I want bc I'm so old"" (62)

To actually pouting. She will put on a pouting kid, kind of angry voice and say things like ""no one ever listens to me"" or ""what am I see through"". 

I have zero patience for this but I dare not say anything. It's not worth it, I just let her sister, hubby or my SO to handle her when she gets like that.

My buddy was a great cook (and is now a top notch professional chef) and every year his mother would hand him a credit card to go buy whatever he wanted to cook. We also, drank here before being 21 - so it was super cool. 

I called a cab bc otherwise it would take two buses to get there and it was freeeezing. I get in the cab and the driver is a tiny woman who speaks little English. 

The car service's base is two blocks away from where I need to be dropped off so I just tell her to bring me to the base. Simple. She came from there, we can get back.. 

I look up just in time to see her getting on the entrance to an extremely busy bridge that leads from Brooklyn, to Staten Island. This one act will bring us miles out of the way, has a ton of traffic on it, and costs over 10$ to cross. 

I yell out in English obviously that's the bridge entrance which due to our language barrier devolves quickly into me only saying ""No Stop!"". Which she did. On the highway. And tried to back up. 

We proceeded to get shit ass lost for 2 hours in Staten Island. I was debating getting out of the car and calling my dad to come get me like a 10 year old..

It's embarrassing. When I  was young teen the ""goat skit"" from the Adam Sandler CD was the funniest thing in the world to me (also embarrassing). At one point the goat says ""well fuck me in the goat ass"". I indoctrinated the phrase immediately into my 14 year old repertoire of cursing. 

But now I am in my 30's, but the neuron highways are strong.

4635,"I worked a vet office for years. We had a frequent flier client who we came to learn was taking care of her husband. The light of her life was her pomeranian, who admittedly was as charming as you can imagine a dog to be. The owner would bake us goodies and bring us coffee constantly. She knew all of us by name which was a staff of 20. 

The dog developed arthritis, then cushing's syndrome and during a hospital stay which required IV lines and many daily treatments. the dog understandably resisted treatments (being pilled and being force-fed). One day while the owner was visiting the dog slipped a disc in her back trying to leap out of her mid level height cage, which rendered her rear legs - pretty useless. 

I was discharging her dog from the hospital and learned her husband had recently passed. 

So I hugged her. And she kept her arms down... and her head slightly up and off in the distance. The Whole Time.. 

She said ""no, don't hug me, if you I will cry. If I cry i don't think I will stop.

I am wearing synthetic leather atm. I wonder if mink and rabbit were replaced with Kittens and puppies if we might change our opinions. Fact is, some animals are bred to be harvested. I love burgers. I am not an elitist in regard to animal husbandry. I see reasoning, and I can't equate my thoughtful reasoning of animal husbandry with that of fur for fashion. Minks are cute af. Great question.

5023,"I am very ashamed to write this and it was the worst thing by far I have ever done. My mother and I had an terrible relationship. She chose drugs over me and took my older sister down with her. Her and my sister (19 at the time) would spend all day trying to ""score"" and scrape money together and I was trying to stay as far away from them as I could, which was hard at 16. Keep in mind they were ""functioning"" addicts meaning they worked and on rare occasions seemed totally normal. Unless they needed money to score. 

So anyway, I started working at 16 and as soon as I hit 18 I got myself a credit card that I NEVER used and took out 250$ from my bank to get a tattoo. 

Day of the tattoo I go into my dresser to count the cash before heading out and the money was gone. This was in no way the first time this happened, but she KNEW I was getting a tattoo and that I was SO HAPPY about it - and she did it anyway. 

I freaked out. I freaked the fuck out. The worst part to me was she refused to admit she took it. She just sat there silent and I begged her to just admit it, rage tearfully begged. I needed that confession deep down inside and she just sat there. I was not myself, some rage monster version of myself. 

So I took her shitty jewelry (she sold anything of value long ago) and told her I was going to pawn it. She just sat there and said ""fine if that's what you feel you have to do"". Her reply put me over the edge and I got 30 lousy bucks from the pawn shop and felt sick to my stomach.

Later she took out 5k in cash advances on my credit card and I had to either pay it, or have police pull the bank footage which would have resulted in her arrest. I paid it - it wasn't worth the guilt I would have felt. 

Now she is dead and I think about the day I took her jewelry, her just sitting there looking up at me and you know what? At the time I was so rage stricken I couldn't see it but now as I recall it, she looked just like a little kid. 

and now I'm tearing up. thanks reddit!

5026,"Hey dude. This is heavy. It's never easy to give advice about a relationship based on a paragraph. However, you sound like you are feeling concern over being ""trapped"" in a relationship. that ""on edge"" feeling is not good for you. So given that it's impossible to help based on a paragraph here I go. 


Go to therapy. It's a safe place to talk about this and it will help you gain clarity. 

Don't get married until you KNOW - it's ok to be engaged for over year, take a breathe and be there for your child. 

tell her. just tell her. it won't be easy but it's imperative. You can post here and on on /r/relationships but trust me, this is btwn you two and more importantly YOU. 

To be on your side; 
You are entitled to this, and you make sense. 
To her; introverts are dynamic and are still the same person you fell in love with. 

I suggest couples therapy, and not reddit. Best of luck and hey - be a great dad &lt;3

It's not congruent, the therapists ask me for sessions, multiple ones but don't refer clients. They are so happy when I come in and tell me TMI and what not, but don't send me clients.. 

Recently I gave a session to  CEO of a HUGE wellness center - she also sent her husband and booked her daughter thereafter... sounds great right? She asked me if I thought it could work in her center, and that stated that she was very interested in pursuing that if i agreed. 

I got burned..my dream job let me down so much (I don't get paid without clients and have given so many freebies). 

I am afraid this is the same boot. I don't want to be let down again because this training was a career change, my passion, and a strain on my finances, more so my partner is carrying the weight and I fear another dead end lead.

We stayed friends but only saw each other a few times a year. Life happened. When we did see one another it was like no time in between took place, we picked up right where we left off.

Never give milk - only KMR 

keep a heating on low nearby the kitten in the large crate covered with a towel in which the kitten can easily get on and away from. 

KMR is kitten milk, then sell bottles and this at pet stores, however if the kitten is eating is eating solid food, mix in warm water to make a   slur. 

Make sure this kitten in drinking water and is parasite free - parasites can kill a young kitten.

Know that diarrhea can kill a kitten, fast. 

If the kitten seems lethargic give it syrup and go to the vet.

I want to mention it also, a relationship trend of boredom and then finding someone that I did not wanna fuck things up with at 25 that got me started on the journey.

I really appreciate the dedication that it takes to eat well and work out - which both typically make people happy and I lack that discipline and acknowledge I am missing out on that as in some way I know it would make me ""less bored and happy"" though for me I would just start to let that judgemental voice in or be sad about not eating that slice of pizza... it's a personal journey.

Sounds like you get bored and need something spirit/excitement/passion that comes from YOURSELF and is sustainable. This will help you and everyone you have a relationship with (non-romantic included). 

**life is pretty good most of the time! But I feel like all of that is replaceable with any woman I could date.**

Not sure about this, because I get the feeling any woman you date will either not last for whatever reason, or will - which could again bore you. Imagine your wife heard you call the good times you have together replaceable. That's pretty much a que this is over - but before you move onto another faster model that's more exciting I highly suggest you seek couples and self therapy before you break a heart.

This is a poem that we kept around our Practice that I would like to share. 

'There is a bridge connecting Heaven and Earth. It is called the Rainbow Bridge because of its many colors. Just this side of the Rainbow Bridge there is a land of meadows, hills and valleys with lush green grass.

When a beloved pet dies, the pet goes to this place. There is always food and water and warm spring weather. All the animals who have been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by.

The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. Her bright eyes are intent; her eager body begins to quiver. Suddenly she begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, her legs carrying her faster and faster. You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

Then you cross the Rainbow Bridge together, never again to be separated.'",2015-12-02 18:21:11+00:00,cxkmsby,1.0,t3_3v5xsm,3980.0,relationships

He decided that Iowa needed some decent pizza (sorry Iowa I love you but really..) and opened a place. It was a hit, they started making sandwiches and then diner food. He even got to cater the rock shows that would come to town (Meatloaf was his favorite of these stories, the singer not the meal). He opened a second one, it was a hit. 

At this point he had a family, two successful restaurants, his dream girl, a baby, a small plane and tons of friends. Life was sweet. I should mention here it was 1980 and money meant parties, and partying meant the occasion indulgence in drug use.

His college business teacher suggests a wild idea. He lives in Dallas and thinks they could open a place there, that he would manage and run. In fact, he would put his house, car and boat up as collateral. My dad was against it but really looked up to the man. So he went for it, put his house and one of the restaurants. 

Needless to say Dallas could care less for pizza, sandwiches with wacky names and typical diner food. My dad lost his house and his restaurant in Iowa. Eventually it came to light that his ""partner"" still kept all his property somehow, be it that he never risked and lied or that Texas protects property (I have no idea). 

My Dad ended up taking us all to Hunter Mountain in the winter to live for free, and very cold, is his parents summer home. He rented a studio in Brooklyn and would stay there Mon - Fri working in his uncles car dealership and drive up to be with us every weekend. 

Enter the drugs bc of loneliness and self pity and my mother leaving him. That's the having it all, losing it and going off the deep end part.

In your case maybe see a sex therapist together. Just my two cents as a person that had vulvodynia and healed 100%. Had HL and got my groove back a few years ago..Best of luck and grats on the son.

5176,"I am standing on a beach on a gloomy day. A huge wave begins to grow, the water coming from the sea and receding from the beach coming together to make a bigger, and bigger wave. It's stuck there, towering in place perfectly still though steadily growing and I know, it's gonna fall any second now.
 I can see all kinds of sea life swimming in the wave, caught up by it's power. I stare at the hugeness of it as whales and sharks are trapped inside. 
I start to run screaming for people to come with me and run for their lives. 
No one believes me, and then it happens. I always get away.
 
Until one day the dream came again on it's monthly or so schedule and I decided not to run this time. The wave never came down and that was how I learned to influence my dreams from time to time.

5179,"You are not stuck waiting, you have some choices on how you can move through the next 8 or so hours. I am going to suggest a few. Stop, breathe and distract yourself. Visit r/funny, check out No Sleep - try to get sucked into something you enjoy. Time is here, it's not going to speed up but you have power over how you spend it. 
Maybe contact a friend and line them up for later in case you need some support after the mystery is revealed. Just knowing you have a someone there in case you are hurt or angry is a great relief. 
No matter what he says to you later just remember it's better FOR YOU to hear it, feel it, and react (or even better ""choose an action"") from a position of clarity. Think about something that comforts you, grounds you and makes you laugh and do it. Walking is a grea way to clear your head if you want to move. Hell, have a dance party for one.

5183,"You have tried PT? My night guard was custom made at the dentist, and hurt like hell when I used it so I stopped! I went to Walgreens and bought the kind you heat in water and bite into, It was much looser and more comfortable. During the beginning of my TMJ recovery I also took Flexeril before bedtime, it's a muscle relaxer that's pretty gentle. I also looked in the mirror while I was chewing and saw my jaw was not moving up and down but on an angle, I chewed very aware of that and focused on up, down straight while chewing. I also used heating pads on my neck and shoulders to make sure they weren't tense and pulling on my jaw. I know this is a text block - but I want you to know that for me, it took about 3 months of improving and that was it. MAYBE during allergy season it gets tense, but I just massage it away and that's it. There is hope and I am hoping for you. ",2015-11-18 17:02:09+00:00,cx4nvft,3.0,t1_cx4me3z,2186.0,AskNYC

In my experience with TMJ I refused braces to fix my occlusion which is a common treatment plan. The night guard helped, but what REALLY saved my butt was; a Physical Therapist. Yes, there is PT for your TMJ and it basically cured mine. Sadly my dentist did not recommend this treatment I just happened to have a great relationship with my PT from a previous injury and emailed her asking about it. I went in and after 3 sessions I was 80% better. Good Luck! ",2015-11-18 16:15:55+00:00,cx4m07u,1.0,t3_3t26vk,159360.0,AskNYC
