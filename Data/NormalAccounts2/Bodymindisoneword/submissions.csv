His coworkers stationed there are our only source of information. 

But I have some pretty strange questions about the lifestyle and they are very bias to have us move out there.  

For example, when it snows is it typical to stay home from work and make sure you get supplies before hand - or are the roads plowed often? When it snows my spouse's coworkers that live in Bloomfield just work from home for days.. but I won't have that luxury, I'll have to find a job in Boulder. I am used to snow never being an impediment so I am wondering how bad it gets. 

We have also been told that seasonal allergies are less severe there (as opposed to where we live now). Google shows Colorado Springs as being one of the top ten places to live but that location is no where near Bloomfield and is pretty specific.. The potential for allergies being better than where I live is a huge motivator. 

Lastly, on one of his trips there to the main office he did experience altitude sickness, the next trip in we got him on Diamox before hand and it worked. My question is when you travel for a long period of time and return home to Co, have you even gotten altitude sickness when you got back home?

She is sick, she has been going to the doctors, they have a diagnosis of adema from the years of drugs she took. Texting me 5 times asking me what an echocardiogram is won't change anything.

The first year he was there his title and duties were ""Account Coordinator"". After that year the company offers employees the chance to grow within the company, my SO strongly disliked duties as they entailed a lot of dealing with account managers (very pushy, commission driven, and generally rude..) so this opportunity was wonderful. 


He chose to train as a Certification Tech. Much less talking to people, even if so it's via email and the work is the back end kind he loves to do. The boss of this dept and my SO hit it off well and his team as a whole was full of people he enjoyed working with. There are reviews done quarterly and my SO is pretty much the go-to golden child of the dept. 



The company got a new VP and my SO's boss was transferred to another dept that handles security alerts (my SO's team does this as well but not exclusively). His new boss delegates her duties to my SO and another person on the team.. the two of them are now doing their own job and many 'projects' (her job) throughout the work week.. 


Well things got worse for my SO. Today they announced that the Certification Techs (what he does now) will also do account coordinating (what he used to do and hated). 


So here is my HR question.. his previous boss's dept, that handles security alerts is not looking to add any members.. his previous boss has stated to my SO many times that he would snag my SO in a heartbeat if the opportunity ever arose, which would be a god send. Anyway, sorry I am babbling.. 

Can my SO request a formal transfer to the security alerts dept with HR? 

His technical duties now include answering the phone.. for clients. Not to sound too whiny here bc yes I am aware it is 'at will' employment and life is a bitch, but the main reason he requested 2 years ago to train in back end technical work is because his social anxiety gets worse every year.. this is going to be a pickle.

The training was awesome, and expensive. You need a ton of practice hours logged each year and the hands on training is pretty demanding, not to mention becoming a sole proprietor is both time consuming and difficult. I work 30hrs a week at a peanut job to help pay the bills and it's not enough.




It's said that it takes 3-5 yrs to build a clientele and honestly the 3 years of school was long enough for the novelties of being broke to wear off and I can't afford another 3 years of poverty. I need to affiliate with an existing practice, be it a talk therapist, a wellness center, a physical therapist office etc..




Do you know how hard it is to sell yourself as an asset to an existing practice? It's not as easy as ""Hey - Hire me, it will be great this work is amazing!"" There are no employment ads for ""Hiring a practitioner to join us"" that is not specifically looking for something that I am not (massage, acupuncture, nutritionist etc).




Fate would have it that one day, I got a wild hair up my ass and sent a praise email to a big, beautiful, cooperative center simply asking if I could interview the owner for a blog on my website on the merit of incorporating medical therapies with massage, acupuncture and chiropractic care. They had someone there that did something similar to touch and talk therapy already.





We hit it off. He asked me to join the practice one day a week and I was over the fucking moon. Overjoyed. I never felt that good about myself before.
The someone that does something similar to touch and talk therapy was not happy about this and the staff was afraid of her since people she didn't like got fired. This is not hearsay, the manager told me this when I first joined up. Needless to say my time there went from welcoming and excited to ignored and forgotten in a matter of a few months.




It felt like I had something, amazing, I was so proud, I told everyone, I thought my life was going to change in a wonderful way. Then I was so ashamed.
It hurt me in way I had never been hurt before.


It's been 3 months since then. And I have to make a choice. Either email other places and put myself out there again..back to ""hey hire me, it will be awesome!"" or literally give up and get a job that matches my professional skill set. Risks, let downs, or concede and accept defeat.




There is a lynch pin to this story, my SO has been tackling the majority of our finances and is still - a huge supporter of me following this dream. Despite his encouragement I don't think it's fair to him. But if I give up, I am afraid he will be disappointed in me and that I squandered his sacrifice.




I am not sure how to end this, so I just will stop typing.

There are so many different ways to diet, carbs vs calories,  I am not sure what's right for me and since this is a resource of people that are winning/struggling/and just starting out I thought I would ask your opinion. 

I am SW(126) CW(123) GW(110) 5'1F 32 yrs. 

I am eating 1000-1300 calories a day and just starting some simple cardio at home 3-4x a week. I thought that would really ""do it"" for me since I never watched what I ate in the past. It's been three months and only 3lbs down. 

My entire life I have weighed under 110lbs without trying. This year my job became more sedentary and also began taking a low dose of beta blockers. After the new meds I really noticed the change. 

I am a total noob, and yes I checked out the FAQ and the posts are brilliant and plentiful, I am just not sure which strategy will is best for me and your opinions are truly invaluable.

I trained in a touch and talk therapy that I am deeply passionate about. I am fulfilling my final need to provide and record clinical hours (free sessions for the board to review). When I can provide these sessions is limited because I am working 8:30am-3:30pm currently. This gets me home and ready to accept clients at 4:30pm. It seems that a lot of people would rather come during the daytime, and I am off every Friday from work - BUT so is my hubby so clients are no go. 

The last year and half have been hard financially. The job I have is stress-free, is full of free time and is pretty lax. This is important to me - it lends a lot to being able to provide quality therapy after work. Ever come home and just flop on the couch and feel brain dead? Can't do that if I have a 5pm client dealing with anxiety. 

But the pay of this job is reflective naturally. We have only been able to afford this bc my spouse's job is a good one. It's still very tight and trust me the guilt I feel over this is a major factor in this situation. 

My friend who will call Sue works for her family. She has described the culture at her family business as being old fashioned. On time, no music, only work on your computer, bring your lunch bc you get 30 min lunch and we all eat together.. 
That culture makes me queasy. But they an opening she thinks I would be perfect for and wants me to apply. 

SO here are the facts. 
CURRENT; 8:30-3:30 with Fridays off easy work and freedom but total shit pay. 

NEW; 8:30-4:30 Mon-Fri very tedious work with my friend's family (Sue works there too) and a culture that might eat soul. 

It's a fucking 40% pay increase and my guilt is driving me to take it. 

I think it may also derail my focus from joining a wellness center or similar business providing the therapy I love and trained for. 

I have tried this, this past July I was given a one day a week space in a huge cooperative physical therapy office. It totally flopped because they already had someone doing similar work that also an MD so she billed it to insurance companies, I cannot do that so my bookings were at a deficit. This experience really fucked with my confidence.. and still makes me afraid that this will be a struggle for a very long time. 

So what would you do? Any thoughts?
