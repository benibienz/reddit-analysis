1,"The only real answer here is ""who knows?""

The FIA haven't said a peep about F2 and the F3 Lite series since they announced they were in the process of creating them. We've heard little bits from random sources about how the talks aren't going anywhere and neither side (FIA and the GP2 organisers) seem to want to budge.

We thought 2017 might have been the year but then we heard GP2 will be keeping the Dallara car until at least 2018 in July, which goes against the idea of having a somewhat open formula for FIA F2. 

They should really come up with something soon though because at the end of 2018, the GP2/11 chassis will be eight years old. Other series have at least managed to keep an upgrade pattern going, even GP3 has managed to successfully stick to the 3 year change.

It's just another one of those things really, we won't know until we know and right now, no one is saying anything.",2016-11-21 14:19:13+00:00,da9i6ha,2.0,t1_da9f60z,6605,F1FeederSeries

Feels like they know there's no interest in the series but they're too head strong to accept it. The proposed 2017 Australian F3 rules still don't allow current F3 cars to enter in the main championship. This is a car that has been out since 2012, nearly 5 years now.

I always feel like I'm being unfairly harsh on Australian series like F3 or F4, but the organisers seem blissfully unaware that there isn't a market for what they've been trying to do.

But saying that 'we've always allowed TRS type cars to enter'? Not once have I see anything but F3 machinery advertised. And the non-compliant F3 cars wouldn't even be allowed in the main championship, so why would you even bother.

That said, while I think making another summer series in the southern hemisphere is a good idea in theory, we do already have the TRS, and if you start pulling drivers from both series you may end up with even less in each championship.",2016-11-08 07:58:54+00:00,d9qtj6v,1.0,t3_5bs076,430,F1FeederSeries

* The National F4 car is actually a British F3 car (though they're more or less the same chassis, they're still different in a few areas). Also the F4 championships have both N/A and turbocharged engines.
* The Formula Renault 2.0 car is one from a few years back now, and there isn't the Alps championship anymore. Dunno if you were basing the info off the older car or the newer one.",2016-10-18 11:32:37+00:00,d8x27o3,1.0,t3_5836ft,1596,formula1

&gt;Championships counting for Article 5.1.7 a) of Annexe L to the International Sporting Code. In order to be eligible for the below table ***(Super Licence points table)***, the championships concerned will also need to meet the following criteria:

&gt;- Be composed of a minimum of 5 race weekends.
- Be held on a minimum of 3 different tracks.
- Have a minimum 10 drivers starting each race weekend.
- Be regularly sanctioned by its ASN in compliance with the FIA International

341,"Prema's dominance has been a real problem for the series. While it's never a good idea to strike a team down for doing well, the amount of testing they get away with is really pushing the limits. 

As hard as it is to suggest, I think FIA F3 needs to follow F1's limitations to testing outside of race weekend/official tests. Otherwise it'll only scare off the likes of Hitech and Motopark.

We won't know 100% if they were true or not until someone comes out and says they did (like Gunther or Vips), and that might not be for a while. That makes it a little worse in my opinion, the niggling feeling that there may be something going on behind closed doors.

Either way I think it's better to be cautious, but not jump on any theory until there's a bit more backing behind it.",2016-09-12 13:51:03+00:00,d7jj01r,5.0,t1_d7jitqk,300,F1FeederSeries
343,"I don't remember mentioning team orders at all, but Prema have certainly shown that they'll use them to the benefit of a driver if they need too. 

I can think of maybe one example of where they could have done it at Zandvoort, but then why would they ask both Gunther and Cassidy to move over with so much still left in the season?

As for F4, I can see why Vips would be pissed being asked to move over, but in that case Schumacher is fighting for the championship and he isn't. 

I guess at the end of the day, Prema are giving him that drive and still have the right to ask any driver to move out of the way. They of course don't have to listen but I don't think it would go well for them in the long run.",2016-09-12 11:59:37+00:00,d7jfo7t,3.0,t1_d7jfb7g,930,F1FeederSeries
344,"Oh he'll definitely be driving for Williams next year, there's no doubt about that. With a seat free potentially one year earlier than we expected too.

The way I see it is, Stroll has shown he has the ability to learn, and he himself admits mistakes when he makes them. With just that small personality trait, it already puts him in my good books and most likely in everyone involved in Formula 1's books as well.

Like you said, we've known, and have been saying for a long time that Stroll has been one of the few cases where we absolutely KNEW he would make it to Formula 1 at some point, but it really depended on how he made it that would shape him.

As people continue to point out, he's rolling in cash, and that's through no fault of his own so I think it's more petty jealousness that annoys people in that regard. Another driver with a seemingly endless budget is Lando Norris and he hardly gets the same treatment.

When Stroll dominated the first F4 series there was, I was interested. When Stroll went on to win the TRS season straight after against some seriously good drivers, I was even more impressed.

When he joined F3 and seemingly had no hang of his car and was being carless (not agressive) left right and centre, I too called him out as being ridiculous.

But when he managed to turn around his performances after a race ban and use it to finish the season on a high? Not many drivers could take such harsh criticisms and turn them into results. And this year in F3 has shown he's now the complete package because of it.

Make no mistake, his backing has helped tremendously, but a driver also needs to be competitive, otherwise Nikita Mazepin would be in F1 as well.

He's talented, Young(er than Verstappen), and above all else, has the backing to get him where he needs to be. He has everything he needs to do well and I'm sure he will.

Also /r/Formula1 seems to pick on drivers just for the hell of it so I pay it no mind. They gave Sirotkin shit for simply being Sauber's test driver a few years back, you don't have to do much to get shat on by a group like that. 

But like I said, there are those who look passed that and see that he's ready for F1. Will he be compared to Verstappen? Absolutley. Will he get endlessly ridiculed if he doesn't do as well as him? Absolutley. But that won't matter in the long run. 

I'm not yet convinced Lance will win a world title, but I'm sure he'll be able to mature far better in F1 rather than mulling around in the lower leagues when he's ready.

I probably wrote too much but that's what I think anyway. I think people need to start giving younger drivers a break and stop comparing them to Verstappen, who is the exception not the rule.",2016-09-12 06:32:10+00:00,d7j9tup,1.0,t3_52cqiz,5519,F1FeederSeries

665,"In 2014 the team Verstappen was with, Van Amersfoort Racing, wasn't as high ranking as Prema Powerteam, the team Ocon was with. Prema had long been the established 'team to beat' so naturally they had very experienced mechanics and engineers to extract all the performance they could out of a car everyone was using. This is why they've produced the champion in the series for every single year so far.

Another factor was the Mercedes engine that Prema ran was perceived the better choice to the Volkswagen engine that Van Amersfoort were running. The engines are highly regulated so technically there shouldn't be any differences, but in certain scenarios the Mercedes engine was better, but it could also be said that people complaining for the sake of complaining.

While F3 isn't a spec series since teams can pick and chose engines, chassis, brakes, dampers ect ect, there's usually a formula that most teams will go with. Because of this, everyone uses a Dallara chassis (If you made F1 like this, everyone would want a Mercedes car for the same reason), and then the teams usually toss up between the Mercedes or VW F3 engine. There are others but since they're not as widely used in Europe, not a lot of teams use them (like Toyota and Honda engines).

So TL:DR, if there was any kind of difference between the cars, it wasn't enough for it to be a game breaker. It's more down to how a team runs their car, and this is where Ocon and Prema had the upper hand.",2016-08-06 15:35:19+00:00,d66qlrj,2.0,t1_d65gyma,86131,formula1

675,"I think it's probably down to the organisers on this one, and it really reminds me of the Australian F4 series that has come of it.

As we know, the F4 SEA series is the continuation of the AsiaCup series, a series that used to get an okay number of drivers competing, usually mid to high teens for such an abstract series. So making this series into an F4 series makes sense because there's already the established people working behind it.

Now, the F4 China series is a bit different. One would have assumed that they would have used the opportunity to turn the China Formula Grand Prix or CFGP series into the new F4 series since there was (and still is) a good field of about 10 drivers in it. Yet they didn't, polarised any hope of having a big field and now run the F4 series alongside it.

Now we come to Australia, where there's a very much dying F3 series, and a somewhat thriving Formula Ford series with a decent field of drivers in it. So, instead of working out a way to make the transition relevant from the dying F3 series, or merging the Formula Ford series into something more modern, they decide to go it on their own to take drivers away from both series.

And so we end up with these F4 series with honestly laughable numbers when compared to Japan or Germany, all so an organiser can have their own way. Sure there's probably more to it (I'm not expert, really, I know nothing) than that but it waters down the results of the other F4 markets when there's fields of less than 9 drivers.

So that's why I don't think they'll merge, if they can't even decide to work out a sustainable championship in the first place, then why bother merging with a rival series? F4 doesn't always have to come from another series, as we've seen with the second year boom from the NEZ series, but there has to be a market to begin with or I don't think they should bother.

So to answer your question, yes it would make sense, but then that would be too easy.",2016-08-05 13:02:39+00:00,d65adup,2.0,t1_d6570td,7830,F1FeederSeries
676,"We've actually had F4 support an F1 round already, with the *FIA F4 NACAM Championship* (basically a fancy way of saying Mexican F4) supporting the Mexican GP last year. 

You wouldn't have known unless you went since it's hard enough finding info about the series, but they were there and only had a single race. Usually they have 3 races a weekend so it was certainly changed around for F1 rather than F4.

Also we had the *FIA F4 NEZ Championship* support the Russian Grand Prix earlier this year too, though this time it was 2 races (The series runs 3).

If all goes well, we'll have the *FIA F4 South East Asia Championship* support the Malaysian Grand Prix too later this year. Notably, these are races where there hadn't been the presence of GP2 or GP3, so that might explain why. Though GP2 &amp; GP3 will be at Sepang which is why I have doubts if they'll actually have F4 too.

It's mostly the fringe F4 series that are supporting F1 races, the likes of the German, Italian and British series don't really need that extra incentive for drivers to join up, since they're just a continuation of older series (like formula ford) rather than brand new series created for a new market of drivers.

FIA F4 doesn't even support any of the FIA F3 races, so I do wonder if this is a specific move by the FIA to not have it all in one place at one time.

Honestly I feel like he himself doesn't want to rush to F1 any time soon. We all know he's been destined for F1 since he got out of a KF1 kart, but whether that was through money or talent wasn't a sure thing at the time.

But now we know, or at least we should know, that having backing is one thing, but money won't win you a championship. It helps let's not be blind to that but it won't drive the car for you.

I'm still not sure whether this is for his money, or his experience. Maybe with his recent surge in competitiveness in the Formula V8 3.5 series (3 podiums in 4 races) he feels like he'll be able to make a better showing than in Austria?

It wasn't like he was setting the world alight in F4 either, which makes this jump even more crazy. The only other driver I'm aware of that jumped from the F4 level to GP3 was Ralph Boschung, but even he had a decent first season.

Whether you believe that or not is up to you but I don't think he would tarnish his career like that.

Stroll has had an amazing pedigree so far, it's not Verstappen levels but his F4 and Toyota Racing Series titles coupled with his performances in F3 late last year and this year really make him a stand out for F1. He did get his name in the headlines last year for being incredibly reckless for two rounds in a row in F3, but he bounced back and ended up coming 5th overall.

He was also part of the Ferrari Driver Academy, which he ditched to become one of Williams development drivers last year.

And lastly, his dad is a multi-billionaire, so he has zero reasons to worry about funding. Simply put, he'll make it to F1 sooner rather than later (if he progresses at the rate he has so far).",2016-05-10 14:46:41+00:00,d2zymb3,4.0,t1_d2zycg9,392,F1FeederSeries

That said, if you're after a talented Canadian driver who will most likely race in GP2 next year then Lance Stroll is your best bet.

That said, Gasly is another driver to watch for. He wasn't setting the world on fire last year because of his inability to keep his tyres in tact, but if he can work that out, we know he can go fast and considering how (more) cut-throat Red Bull is being lately, I don't think he'll take it lying down.

1603,"What makes it more confusing is the car now used in the BRDC F3 series is simply an FIA F4 car with a beefier engine. 

Which of course, the BRDC F4 championship was not using an FIA F4 car, because the MSA Formula Championship was the FIA F4 series in the UK because the BRDC F4 series had the naming rights for F4 in the UK.

So if we're not already confused as it is, the BRDC F4 championship started in 2013. Then the FIA introduced FIA F4, a standard of F4 series starting in Italy in 2014. Then in 2015 they wanted an FIA F4 series in the UK, only to have the naming blocked by the BRDC F4 series, so they went with the MSA Formula name.

So in 2015 we had an F4 championship that wasn't an F4 championship, and an F4 championship that was, but wasn't called F4 because the other said they couldn't.

So then the BRDC F4 series goes and gets itself an FIA F4 grade car, slaps a faster engine in, and suddenly gets the tender to call itself an F3 series in 2016, because the British F3 series folded the year before in 2014.

So now we have a series running an F4 car, calls itself an F3 championship when it really isn't. And a series that will probably change its name from MSA Formula to British F4 next year.

Qualifying is in 2 groups, the fastest 11 from each group automatically qualify for the three main races.

Those left over will have a separate qualifying race to fill up the rest of the grid by finishing position. So 1st in the qualifying race starts 23rd, 2nd in 24th and so on. There's 37 cars entered this weekend with only 35 allowed to race, meaning the last two finishers in the Qualifying Race will DNQ the three races.

I get that when you ask ""should either of them been allowed to race?"" the answer is ""of course"", but even then, what if we get an exceptional karter come through and absolutely bomb it? Karts to Single-seaters ins't such an easy step.

I don't think there needs to be a ban for F3 in general, but I do think that maybe for now, the FIA F3 European Championship needs drivers with as much prior experience in lower levels as possible to avoid what happened last year. 

Maybe taking the Karting &lt; FIA F3 route out was the wrong thing to do and seems a little silly, but the idea that drivers need more experience before putting themselves in the spotlight is perhaps a better thing.

Sure we won't get drivers like Verstappen making huge leaps and bounds in the feeder world, but if a driver was really that good, they would have made it their anyway, albeit a little later.

Maybe with the F3 Light series coming up, we'll see the top tier karters go there from karts, and those with perhaps less results or want more time to learn in a single-seater taking F4 instead.

So I'm leaning more on the side that Prema will have their own livery in which case Gasly's car will have the usual nose and engine cover Red Bull Sponsors.

You see things like cars/chassis costing $50,000 (F4) to $700,000 (GP2). No one usually expects the driver to actually go out and buy the whole car, so teams will buy the them and lease them out to drivers instead. Sure they'll take a big hit in season 1 with the initial costs but once the 3rd or 4th driver comes along then they'd be making money, granted the car isn't smashed to bits.

Other things like entry fees, tyres, spare parts or fuel will be paid for by the driver. You break it, you bought it I guess.

As for the team personel, I'm sure a lot of them are in it just for the experience at the lower levels, so their pay may not be that great, but I wouldn't know.

Ideally, I'd want F2 to go a bit further than F3, maybe open up the regulations on electronics and gearbox's to give an incentive to more manufacturers to join. This would mean that no team is receiving direct manufacturer support, like in F3 where teams can pick and choose what they want.

* German/ADAC F4 has it's own live stream, though it's in German but still worth it considering it's arguably the best F4 series at the moment.
* Italian F4 is the same, has it's own live stream, but this time in Italian.
* MSA Formula gets like one or two races broadcasted on ITV4 live, but that's about it.
* All Aussie F4 races get broadcasted on Foxtel/Pay-TV in Australia.
* Nothing for the NACAM/Mexican F4 series yet.
* No idea about the USF4 series yet either.
* The Japanese F4 series gets highlights but only on Japanese TV, and good luck finding it.
* Same goes for the Chinese F4 series.
* The NEZ/SMP series is fully online with it's own live stream in english.
* Every other series we don't know about yet.

So basically, the NEZ, German and Italian series all get proper live stream/broadcasts for every race. The MSA series will get one or two races a round on tv only, and the Aussie series is entirely on Pay TV.

We've got every race this year of the series that do live stream in our race replay section if you wanted to re-watch anything from this year to see if it's worth it.

Now if even 10 or 20 of them wanted to move up, we've got a huge bottleneck wth only 1 serious F3 series in Europe. And with potentially two more series in Europe for next year, the Spanish and Benelux series, it could get even worse.

Not to mention 57 unique drivers were entered into the Japanese F4 series. Surely the F3 field would have to grow to compensate that. 

Of course, not every single driver is going to graduate, but even if only a small sum of those do, there still isn't a lot of breathing room for them. I imagine that's why a lot of drivers are looking into FR2.0 for next year.

Even if he does win, does that mean that Red Bull have to toss aside a driver? What if next years Toro Rosso ends up doing super well by both Sainz and Verstappen? Could Red Bull kick either of them out based on that?

What Gasly really needs to hope for is timing. Toro Rosso drivers always got the seats because they were there at the right time. So Gasly will need to win, and hope that one of the Toro Rosso drivers has an awful season, or hope that Ricciardo or Kyvat do the same.

* **Ralf Aron:** Italian F4 winner like Stroll was last year, and showed himself capable in the ADAC series as well.
* **Guanyu Zhou:** Second in the Italian F4 series and it also has the backing of Ferrari like Stroll. I don't see any reason for them to keep him in F4 for another year.

I'd say maybe they'll grab a driver from outside of their sphere of influence as team leader like they did with Rosenqvist this year, but the team has shown time and time again it is capable of creating strong drivers out of those with little experience.",2015-10-19 00:59:57+00:00,cw4mu3i,1.0,t3_3palpr,782,F1FeederSeries
2579,"Yeah but that's all they're allowed to use. You can't bring a different branded engine or chassis, it has to be the Toyota-Dallara combination, and that's why the series isn't open.

2581,"The idea for FIA F2 is much like the current plan with FIA F3 except more open. With FIA F3, any manufacturer can build a car or engine as long as it adheres to the basic ruling. Though this has inadvertently led to Dallara making the best chassis and out lasting the competition and only Mercedes and VW making decent engines.

With F2 the rules should be even more than that, with the FIA hoping that there will be lots of interest from manufacturers to design cars and engines with the rules a bit more open, a bit like F1 really.

So yeah, the spec series of GP2 will become the Open series of F2.

And I think it's just due to coverage with the whole ""which F3 series do I choose"" thing.

Because the Euroformula Open series doesn't allow open regulations (go figure with a name like that), The FIA doesn't consider it a proper F3 series, so you only get 10 points on your license for winning, as apposed to 30 for the FIA series.

A lot of people aren't sure where GP3 will sit. Regardless of the fact that the FIA F3 series will be the FIA F2 direct feeder series, GP3 still has the rights to run at the F1 circus, something the F3 European Championship does not.

National F3 series are all dying, and it's a bit sad really but running 4-5 cars each season just isn't worth it. I would rather have a healthy 30 car series than multiple 10 car series.

To be honest, I thought the idea of GP2 becoming F2 and essentially killing FR3.5 would be a bad thing at first. But if we see it as a merger of both series into 1, then I can see it working a lot better.

Obviously having no competition is the FIA's goal here, though I'm not sure if having 1 F3 series go into 1 F2 series will work. Perhaps they'll need to have more continental championships at some point? (not just a European one). 

I don't know, that's just wishful thinking. But I thinking an American Championship or Asian Championships alongside a European one would be a great way to consolidate a lot of series. That's if we really are going to go through with this defined F1 route of course.

3152,"No worries.

Basically, they're both feeder series. Where they sit on the ladder is a bit awkward but most would agree that GP3 sits slightly higher up than Formula 3.

GP3 is the direct feeder series created for GP2, which of course is a series that theoretically goes straight onto F1. If you go back many decades, you'll see that GP2 is actually the old F2 series from the 50's, just named differently.

This becomes a problem because the GP2 series is considering going back to the F2 name, which in turn would make the now F3 series the direct feeder series to it, and not GP3.

So as you can see, it's a little confusing right now.

GP3 teams and drivers all use the same car and engines. The F3 series in question is the 'FIA European Formula Three Championship', which is one of the last few remaining F3 series as there used to be a lot, almost one for every country.

This particular F3 series does have regulations on what car and engine you can use, but any manufacturer can be used if it fits, so it's not limited to one chassis/engine.

That being said, the F3 car developed by Dallara has been so competitive over the past decade or two, that we've only had 1 type of car being used in the series, even though you don't have too.

Engine wise, there are two main engine manufacturers in WV and Mercedes. There are others developed like the NBE engine but they are less competitive and only 1 team is running that engine this year.

What further complicates this is that for the first time in ages, another chassis manufacturer and engine manufacturer will be joining the series in Portugal for the next round. Whether they are competitive remains to be seen.

So in short, you're right. GP3 is pretty much spec all round while the F3 series in question has more open regulations. That said, because of the dominance in F3 by certain manufacturers, it has also ended up like GP3, where everyone has been using the same car and the same (2) engines.

I'm not the best at explaining things, but if there's anything you don't understand, don't hesitate to ask.",2015-08-24 03:29:28+00:00,cudjbmb,6.0,t1_cudiy05,758,F1FeederSeries

3502,"I figured this would end up here soon, it's a great post by the way, I love the effort and attention to detail put into it.

I think it would also be an idea to see where the F3 champions have gone to as well since success in F3 usually means success in other series, whether DTM, F1, IndyCar ect.

What I find right now with Formula 1 is we have a stagnant grid, and the drivers winning these series are all well into their careers as well.

It hurts to say it but spending something like 3 years in GP2 or combination of that and FR3.5 is off-putting to many potential team owners from picking those drivers.

Right now we have rookies that spend 2, maybe 3 years in F1 before being dropped, but those who stay longer tend to stay for a much longer time. 

20 seats, and a more or less locked out grid of drivers means its incredibly hard to make it into F1 as it is. If we look at how many rookies were picked up in 2010 in comparison, it's a lot more mostly because there were more teams willing to pick them up.

Vandoorne is the obvious example right now of ""when is he getting into F1?"". But even if he lights up every single series he goes into, if McLaren have both Button and Alonso, they're NEVER going to drop either of them unless they decide to leave themselves.

The past 3 GP2 champions weren't really in the best position to get into F1. They'd all taken many years to get the title, while those who had spent less time but with similar championship standings like Gutierrez and Nasr were picked up instead.

Sure, money is a factor, and even programmes like Red Bull don't fund the driver completely (just ask Gasly),  but if you're in a programme from the get go like Hamilton or Vettel, you have a seriously higher chance of getting into F1 than if you weren't. 

We see people sling the pay driver term around, but Teams are not stupid enough to pick up drivers with a tonne of cash with no results. Or the grid would look a lot different to how it is now.

In the end, being a feeder champion is a top mark on your resume, but without the backing of a team when the sport is so dependant on it latley, you're almost shit out of luck.

Look I'm not saying that it's all over, I'm just saying that once we get past the Formula Fords in Australia, there is very little reason to stay here for F3, which is more or less dead, but so is all the other national series around the world baring a couple.

3697,"Basically, when the new super license points came into affect this year, the FIA European Formula Three championship became the only series to consider if you were in that F3/FR2.0 part of your career.

Winning the FIA title? 40 points.

40 points is enough to get you a super license.

In comparison, both GP3 and FR3.5 only give the champion 30 points. And every other national F3 series that didn't go bust last year only gives you 10 points.

Because of how much the series has to offer, no one was interested in racing in a national F3 series if it gave you essentially no points, and hardly any spotlight.

So, we went from having probably around 26 full season drivers, to 35 for the first round.

An extra 10 cars on the grid has made a significant difference. Mostly because points are still only awarded to the top 10. So if you're starting 30th, you bet you're going to try anything and everything to get some points.

Not only this, but a lot of these drivers are rookies to Formula Three. About half the grid to be exact, compared to last years 6/7.

So, massive grids + inexperienced drivers + FIA Spotlight now in full focus. You bet there will be a problem sooner rather than later.

It wasn't so bad for the first couple of rounds, but I think the tensions got really bad at Monza. People were getting desperate for points, and so they were over-trying to get them.

And so we get all this discussion from all of this. 

In reality, it's not the entire grid that's at fault, and in a way, you can understand why those who have made the crashes made them. Desperation.

Probably a long answer but I wanted to get everything in without sounding confusing. 

**TL;DR:** FIA introduces points system. One series offers 4x the amount of points. Everyone flocks to the same series including many rookies. 30+ drivers fighting for 1 spot on small tracks = commotion.

**2014: Stoffel Vandoorne.** 

I mean, if he keeps up his unstoppable pace this year, I may as well save him a spot for 2015. The guy walked into a series where recently people have slammed it for being ""no good for rookies"" and how ""you need several years to win the title"". Although he started the year of shakily (even after winning on debut), once he got his footing, he was nothing but dominant. 

Without the slump in the beginning of the year, he would have easily beaten Palmer. I mean his record for Pole positions says enough.

Honourable mentions to Max Verstappen (well duh), and Dean Stoneman. The latter being the most impressive how he managed to come from behind and beat someone like Marvin Kirchhöfer despite switching teams mid-season. Obviously Lynn was the winner but he wasn't the most 'impressive' in my view at the time.

----

**2013: Daniil Kvyat.** 

If I'm honest, 2013 was a really underwhelming year for me. But the only driver that really stood out towards the end was Kvyat, and that's why he went to Formula 1 straight after. In fairness it was his first year in the series. But I would have loved to have seen what he would have done if he had moved to FR3.5 with Vandoorne after their FR2.0 rivalry.

Honourable Mentions go to Vandoorne, who walked into the FR3.5 series along side his McLaren junior team mate Kevin Magnussen, and turned out to be thoroughly more impressive. He even beat Da Costa, who was supposed to be the driver who took the title by storm. Also worth mentioning Kirchhöfer for his dominance in German F3.

---

**2012: Robin Frijns.** 

Nearly gave this one to Da Costa for his unbelievable pace at the end of the FR3.5 season, but Frijns was a rookie to the series as well and beat out the likes of Bianchi and Bird on equal footing. Well, depending on how you see that final race's contact between himself and Bianchi at least.

Honourable mentions go to Antonio Felix Da Costa &amp; Daniel Abt, who both made Mitch Evans run to the GP3 title one of the most exciting last rounds there has ever been in a series. It's a shame the pair of them looked like they lost their talent in the following year.

---

**2011: Romain Grosjean.** 

No other choice really, after being kicked to the kerb by Renault a few years before, he really one upped the rest field by scoring nearly double the points of second placed Luca Filippi.

Honourable mentions go to Valtteri Bottas (excluding his final race at Monza, because that was awful), and Alexander Rossi for final position of third in his debut season of FR3.5.

---

**2010: Esteban Gutiérrez.** 

Nicknamed the chosen one after a pretty stellar season in the first ever season of GP3. Admittedly, coming into the season, a lot of people wouldn't have put any money on him but his outright pace was fantastic.

Honourable mentions go to Pastor Maldonado and Esteban Guerrieri, who both took an unbelievable amount of wins in both the series they took part in. Even if they were both heavily experienced, it was great to see how dominant they could be.

And I agree, when we had seasons like in 2011-2013 in FR3.5, there was some great talent, but then the cliff was huge compared to the rest of the field.

Either way I think the FR3.5 series is worth at least 40 points, but whether it can be worth 50 like in GP2 as it stands right now is another question.",2015-06-18 23:52:05+00:00,csbbfvm,2.0,t1_csbattf,1149,F1FeederSeries

Same deal as before though, **bold** means a race and everything is ordered to UTC ±0:00. Only televised sessions are listed. Yellow means it clashes with an F1/F1 support event.

Because the FIA and their organisers are literally useless when it comes to timing, we **won't** be having full discussion threads for the F3 &amp; F4 series this weekend. Instead there will be a megathread for both the F3 and ADAC F4 series.

All videos for those events will be posted up (hopefully) within a day of the race anyway if you want to catch up.
