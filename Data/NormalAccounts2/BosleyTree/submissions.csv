^63rd ^Suncity ^Grupo ^Macau ^Grand ^Prix ^- ^FIA ^F3 ^World ^Cup

Welcome everybody to the 63rd running of the **Macau Grand Prix**!

This year marks the 34th time the event has been run under the Formula Three regulations. The event was previously run under *Formula Pacific*, *Formula Libre*, and even *sports-car* regulations in the past before it switched over to Formula Three in 1983.

The winner of the Main Race will officially be recognised as the champion of the **2016 FIA Formula 3 World Cup**. This is also the first event to be officially run by the FIA after a change of ownership occurred a few months ago, which changed the tyre supplier to Pirelli, and the name of the event from the 'Intercontinental Cup' to the 'World Cup'.

####**About**

The crown jewel of the Feeder Series world, the Macau Grand Prix is one of the most exciting, exhausting, and downright dangerous races in all of motorsport.

The comparisons to the Monaco Grand Prix are not without reason, and after looking at [the track](http://content.grandprix.gov.mo/uploads/Image/20100803_Press%20Release_photo1.jpg) one could say they are completely justified. 

The tight nature of the **Guia Street Circuit** as it sprawls over the streets of Macau lead to some interesting corners, including the famous crash prone [Lisboa Bend](http://bluebalu.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/58th-macau-grandprix-2011-7.jpg) and the 7 metre wide [Melco Hairpin](http://www.eurocarnews.com/media/pictorials/2456/15312.jpg).

It is every drivers dream to enter the race, with many wanting to etch their name into history by winning it. Because of its location, there is always a mix of the best talent across the world taking part each year including those from the Americas, Europe, and Asia.

Many current or former Formula One drivers have participated in the event early in their careers and some of them have won the prestigious prize. Famous winners include Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher, David Coulthard, Richard Patrese, Ralf Schumacher, Takuma Sato, and Lucas Di Grassi.

Since its inception, only two drivers have taken victory at the circuit in F3 machinery more than once, with both Edoardo Mortara (2009-2010) and Felix Rosenqvist (2014-2015) taking the win twice. Rosenqvist will be back again for another attempt this year to try to become the first driver to win three races in a row, but he'll have tough competition from not just the many rookies taking part in the event, but also the past winners António Félix da Costa (2013) and Daniel Juncadella (2011) who are looking to join him in winning the event twice.

____

####**Weekend Format**

Over the course of the week, there will be two Practice Sessions, two Qualifying Sessions, the Qualifyication Race, and finally the Main Race. 

The grid for the Qualification Race  is decided by the best time drivers set over the two previous Qualifying Sessions. The Qualification Race is run over 10 laps on Saturday and the finishing position of the drivers decides the grid for the Main Race. The Main Race is then held over 15 laps on Sunday.

#####**Session Times**

All times are UTC+8:00.

**Thursday, 19. November**

09:35-10:15: Free Practice 1    
14:20-15:00: Qualifying 1   

**Friday, 20. November**

09:35-10:15: Free Practice 2    
15:55-16:35: Qualifying 2

____

####**Regulations**

Because the FIA F3 regulations are open to some extent, teams and drivers are eligible to pick any homologated F3 chassis for the event. This is a change from last year where only the [Dallara F312](http://www.eurocarnews.com/media/pictorials/2459/15356.jpg) was allowed entry, but do not be surprised if that is the only car we see again this year as the [Artline P315](http://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Harald-Schlegelmilch.jpg) has not seen racing action in over a year.

Any homologated FIA F3 engine from 2012 onwards is allowed to be entered. Because of this, Macau often sees the highest amount of differing engine suppliers for any Formula 3 event. 

This years engine manufacturers include:

* Mercedes (15 Cars)
* Volkswagen (10 Cars)
* Toyota (1 Car)
* Toda (1 Car)
* Tomei (1 Car)
* NBE (1 Car)

Other homologated engines include Renault Sport and Mugen Honda, but neither has taken part in the Macau Grand Prix since the 2012 regulations came into effect.

___

####**Entry List/Eligibility**

Previously, to be eligible to enter the Macau Grand Prix, a driver must had to have raced in at least one Formula Three sanctioned event over the current year. However, there are some drivers taking part this year without meeting this requirement.

Often, drivers from other series, both above and below Formula Three, will either step down or step up for one event to gain entry to the series. Sometimes drivers from other categories such as touring cars will do the same.

We also know that the FIA F3 cars have it in the system (due to Cassidy's slow down at the Nurburgring), but it isn't being used actively in the championship.

* **GP2** &amp; **GP3** are at Sepang with F1, but they're on much earlier than usual and actually have practice today (Thursday). This is the penultimate round of both championships before they go on break until Abu Dhabi. 
* **FIA F3 European Championship (FIA F3)** is at Imola for it's penultimate round of the season. This has a free live stream on their website.
* **Formula V8 3.5** and the **Euroformula Open (F3)** series are at Monza. Both series are streamed live on Youtube in English with three rounds left to run.
* Finally, the **FIA F4 German Championship (ADAC F4)** and the **Formula Renault 2.0 NEC** series are having their final round at the Hockenheimring. The NEC series is broadcast on Youtube in English while the German series will have a live stream but in German (Possibly English as well though). The title for both series is still down to the wire, with both Aussie Joey Mawson and Mick Schumacher in the running in the ADAC F4 series, and four drivers in the running in the NEC series.

Hopefully this helps anyone who was unaware so much was on this weekend. We'll have discussion thread for each series at the Feeder sub.

*The final FIA F4 British Championship round is on as well but isn't shown outside of the UK.*",formula1,"PSA: There is a LOT of Feeder Racing on this weekend (GP2, GP3, FV835, FIA F3 &amp; More).",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/550jyz/psa_there_is_a_lot_of_feeder_racing_on_this/

So here's what we got:

* All GP2 drivers for round 1
* All GP3 drivers for round 1 (minus Richard Gonda)
* Most Formula V8 3.5 drivers
* A handful of Indy Lights drivers
* A random selection of FIA F3 drivers
* Two Formula Renault 2.0 drivers
* A random selection of FIA F4 drivers
* A tasty treat

We've hit somewhere in the region of 80+ flairs this year, and my hands hurt like you wouldn't believe coding them in. 

Big apologies if I didn't get your driver in this time, I did manage to do every single individual request from the request post a while back though. Same goes for team flairs. They're quite difficult to make small enough while still recognising who it is within a 20x16 pixel picture.

If a significant amount of drivers show up later this year then I might be inclined to update the current lot, but with the lack of decent pictures out there I did the best I could.

So, pick a driver and enjoy this year!",F1FeederSeries,2016 /r/F1FeederSeries Flairs are here!,https://www.reddit.com/r/F1FeederSeries/comments/4j5618/2016_rf1feederseries_flairs_are_here/

###GP2 Series

---
####**What Is GP2?**

The **GP2** series is the premier feeder series to Formula 1, created jointly by Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore in 2005. The broadcasting rights are owned by the Formula One Management group (FOM).

The series is the successor to both the defunct Formula 3000 series, and the European Formula Two series which came before it. Formula 3000 ran between 1985 to 2004, but finally collapsed after rising costs and a ever smaller field of drivers. 

GP2 was thus created with help from Renault/Mecachrome and Dallara to be the series all drivers take on before they head to Formula 1.

More information on the founding of the series can be found at this [link](http://www.gp2series.com/Guide-to/The-series/) and a rundown of the series so far can be found [here](http://www.gp2series.com/Guide-to/The-story-so-far/).

#####**Regulations introduced in 2015**

In 2015, GP2 cars were fitted with the **Drag Reduction System (DRS)** on the car. As the main purpose for GP2 is to prepare drivers for Formula 1, the inclusion of DRS and Pirelli degradable tyres has been met with strong opinions on both sides of the argument for and against, but overall the racing has remained the same.

The GP2 DRS system mimics the one used in Formula 1, and is not 'Push to Pass' system used in other series like Indycar, Formula V8 3.5 or Formula E.

&gt;* The drivers are able to use the DRS as they wish within the designated DRS zones during free practice and qualifying. During both races however, the drivers will only be allowed to activate DRS within the designated zones when they are within less than a second of the car in front at the detection point.

&gt;* During the race, the DRS is available for use after two laps unless decided otherwise by the race director due to poor weather conditions or yellow flags in the designated DRS zones.

&gt;* The DRS zones will be the same as the ones used in Formula One on every circuit of the calendar.

&gt;* The same safety rules apply: the DRS is disabled at the end of the designated zones, and the first time the driver uses the brakes after activation.

###**Race Weekend**

A typical GP2 race weekend consists of the following:

#####Friday

**Free Practice:** A short practice session for the drivers on Friday morning lasting a total of 45 minutes.

**Qualification:** This 30 minute session on Friday afternoon decides the grid for the Feature Race on Saturday. 

This is not a knockout style qualification session, and instead, all drivers are free to set times throughout the entire 30 minute session, with the best time at the end of the session taking pole position.

#####Saturday

**Feature Race:** The first and main race of the weekend is on Saturday, and will either run to a distance of 160 km or 60 minutes, whichever comes first. 

This race includes a mandatory pit-stop that all drivers have to make over the course of the race. When the chequered flag is waved, the top ten will score points.

#####Sunday

**Sprint Race:** The main difference between GP2 and Formula 1 is there is a second race on Sunday called the Sprint Race, which is a shorter race run over a distance of 120 km or 45 minutes, whichever condition is met first. The top eight at the end of the race will score points.

As there is only one Qualifying Session for the Feature Race, pole position for the Sprint Race race is based on the top eight finishers of the Feature Race race using the reverse grid method. 

For example, whoever finished first in the Feature race will start eighth in the Sprint Race. Second place will start seventh, third will start sixth and so on until whoever finished eighth will start on pole for the Sprint Race. 

Those who finished ninth and above will all start from the positions they finished in the Feature Race. Those who retired from racing in the Feature Race will each lineup behind the rest of the grid in the order the retired from.

---

####**Points**

Points are based on the FIA regulated points system used in most series including as Formula 1. The main exceptions are that points are also awarded for Pole Position for the Feature Race (not the Sprint Race), and for the Fastest Lap in each of the two races.

To get points for the Fastest Lap, the driver must finish inside the top ten. If the Fastest Lap was set by someone who finished 11th or further back, then whoever had the fastest lap in the top ten shall receive the points instead. 

This is to stop drivers who have fallen back from putting in qualification style laps or 'glory runs' on fresher tyres to score points.

Position | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th | | Pole | F/Lap
:- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
Feature Race | 25 | 18 | 15 | 12 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 1 | | **4** | *2* |
Sprint Race | 15 | 12 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 1 | - | - | | - | *2* 

* **Pole Position:** 4 (Feature race only)
* **Fastest Lap:** 2 (Both races)

Through this system, the most points that can be earned over the weekend is 48 (Feature Race &amp; Spring Race Win, Pole Position and both Fastest Laps). More information on the regulations can be found [here](http://www.gp2series.com/Guide-to/The-regulations/).

---

####**Tyres**

Over the four sessions in the weekend, each driver will receive five sets of dry-weather tyres, and three sets of wet-weather tyres.

The tyres brought to each round are decided beforehand by Pirelli. The compounds of tyres include the Super Soft, Soft, Medium and Hard tyres, and two compounds will be chose for each event.

At each event, three of the dry-weather tyres selected will be the harder (Prime) of the compounds, with the other two being the softer (Option) compound. For example, if Pirelli chose the Soft and Medium compounds, then they will bring two Soft and three Medium compounds for each driver.

In the Feature Race, each driver must complete a mandatory pit-stop at some point in the race. There are some clauses to this rule.

* The driver must have completed at least *six laps* before the pit-window will open.
* The driver must *not* pit for tyres under a Virtual Safety Car (VSC), unless they were already in the pits or at pit entrance when the VSC was deployed.

---

####**Car Specs**

As a spec series, all the GP2 cars are built and then sold to the teams participating in the championship by one manufacturer. This helps level the playing field for all the drivers competing and puts a lot of emphasis on driver/team car setup and individual skill.

The current cars are built by Dallara, with engine manufacturer Mecachrome building the 4.0L V8 engines. For full specs of the current chassis, [click here](http://www.gp2series.com/Guide-to/The-car-and-engine/).

The current car, the GP2/11, is the third generation chassis for the series since its founding. The original idea was to have a chassis built to last 3 years. The GP2/05 was used from 2005-07 and the GP2/08 from 2008-2010. 

The GP2/11 car was also supposed to follow this pattern, however due to cost cutting, it had been renewed again for the 2014 season for another 3 year cycle, and is expected to be replaced in 2017.

After spending the first six seasons of it's existence on Bridgestone tyres, the series moved over to Pirelli in 2011.

Maxed out, the car can reach speeds of just over 332 Km/h (202 Mph) with the Monza aero packaged configuration applied to the car.

Chassis | Engine | Tyre | Year/s
:- | :- | :-: | :-:
[](/it) Dallara / GP2/05 | [](/fr) Mecachrome V8 NA / 4.0L | [](/bridgestone) | 2005-07

[](/it) Dallara / GP2/11 | [](/fr) Mecachrome V8 NA / 4.0L | [](/pirelli) | 2011-16

####**Champions**

So far in the series history, only one driver has gone on to win the Formula 1 World Championship, and that is current Mercedes F1 driver Lewis Hamilton (with three championships in 2008, 2014 &amp; 2015).

I'm hoping that I've improved the original guide quite thoroughly this time around (such as including the tyre sections). The series will start this Friday 13th May, and will follow Formula 1 for the entirety of the European leg of the season, including Baku, Abu Dhabi and even a return to Malaysia!

If you're interested in watching the sport, there are several TV stations that will show it, [listed here](http://www.gp2series.com/Guide-to/The-2016-TV-Broadcasters/).

Thanks again for reading up until this point. I feel like most of the relative success of the subreddit has been founded on the discussion around GP2, and the facts and figures each weekend only prove that. However, if you have any questions about what was written then please ask away. Any criticism will also be taken into account, and if you just want to insult me then don't hold back.

Other than GP2, a lot of other series will be on this weekend including GP3, numerous F3 and F4 championships and even the Mazda Road to Indy. If you want further information on any of these series (and another 40 other series), then please consult our extensive [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/F1FeederSeries/wiki/edit/index) on the topics!

Final thanks again to /u/prowler760 for being the best moderator a sub could hope for. And thanks to everyone who frequents the sub and makes it feel much more lively than before!

So the following is a list of all the series that have their own streaming service that will be operational this weekend. 

This does not necessarily mean that the series will not have a discussion thread (in the case of FIA F3), but more for those who do not wish to miss any series because of how crowded it is this weekend.

So here is a stickied thread of all the live streaming links and what not for this weekend.

Obviously this is a bit later than last year and the year before but because both GP2 and GP3 start so late, I had no choice.

So yes, If you have a request for a driver, please tell me who, and if at all possible, please provide a side-view of their helmet. It would really help too if the helmet is exactly side on but if not I can try something out.

GP2/GP3 and maybe FV835 drivers will already be included so there's no need to request them. Expect these to be out before round 1 of GP2/GP3.

####**Qualifying/Race Explanation**

Four races are contested each weekend in a new format that involves three qualifying races and a single final race. This is due to the massive number of entrants in the series.

There will be two qualifying sessions, with the grid split evenly between to the sessions. The fastest driver overall will start 1st, while the fastest driver of the second session will start 2nd. 

&gt; For example, if the driver in the second session has the fastest time overall, he/she will start 1st. The driver who set the fastest time in the first session will start 2nd. Then the second driver in the second session will be 3rd, and the second driver in the first session will be 4th, and repeat until there's a full grid.

After the split group qualifying session, the drivers are split into three groups based on their result in qualifying. Each group will contest two qualifying races against another group in a A-B, B-C, A-C format. 

&gt; The drivers will be distributed into the three groups like so. 1st overall will be in Group A, 2nd will be in Group B, 3rd will be in Group C, then 4th will be in Group A as it starts over again.

The top 36 drivers (32 at Adria) after the qualifying races will then contest in a final race that will determine the points scored in all four championships that the F4 Italian Championship has.

&gt;So if a driver finishes well in the two qualifying races they take part in, they will start in the Final. But if they don't score in either and finish well down the grid, they won't start in the final.

If anything else needs explaining, do no hesitate to ask because it is a confusing system.

###Toyota Racing Series (TRS)
####**What is the TRS?**

The **Toyota Racing Series** is the highest calibre of open-wheel formula racing in the country of New Zealand. The series was created back in 2005 with major support from the Motorsport New Zealand organisation and Toyota.

The series initially started out as way to showcase homegrown New Zealand talent, but over the years, the timing and competitiveness of the series has has a global reach and drivers from all over the world now use the series to kick start their seasons.

The series takes place over the European winter, or New Zealand summer, so a lot of young drivers use the series to get track time during the off-season period.

More information on the series can be found [at this link](http://www.toyota.co.nz/racing/toyota-racing-series/about/).

####**Race Weekend**

A typical TRS race weekend can start as early as Wednesday with a heavy emphasis on practice and test sessions for the drivers. Thursday and Friday are also used for small, 30 minute practice sessions for the drivers.

Saturday holds two qualifying sessions and Race 1 at the end of the day. The two qualifying sessions determine the starting grid of both Race 1 and 3 respectively. Race 2 and 3 are both held on the Sunday.

The starting grid for Race 2 can be determined through several measures through the course of the series history. It is mostly decided on a 'partial-reverse-grid', but the amount of drivers reversed is determined through a lucky draw.

The winner of Race 1 will essentially pull a number out of a hat, with the options being four, six, and eight. If the winner gets four, then the top four finishers of Race 1 will be reversed for the starting grid while the rest of the grid starts in their original finishing positions. If they pick six, then the top six reverse, and finally if they pick eight, then the top eight reverse.

There have been other methods where there will be three qualifying sessions held instead, or a fixed number of reverse starting drivers will be used regardless of a lucky dip. 

This is probably the most confusing aspect of the series but it can lead to some interesting starting positions for drivers.

Races 1 and 2 are 15 laps in length, with Race 3 being 20 laps. Race 3 is held as a special race and has it's own separate naming such as the 'Denny Hulme Memorial Trophy' or the 'Spirit of a Nation Cup'.

Race 3 for the New Zealand Grand Prix held at the Manfeild Autocourse is a lot longer in length, lasting a total of 35 laps. 

####**Points**

The points in the TRS are nothing like any other major open-wheel series except for maybe IndyCar. The winning driver scores 75 points, while finishing in 30th, granted there are enough entries, nets a driver just a single point.

In order for a driver to score championship points, they have to complete at least 75% of the race distance, and still be running when the checkered flag is flown. This means that even if a driver crashes out 2 laps before the end, they will not be eligible. 

This puts a further emphasis on drivers not retiring from any races, as the points margin lost from retiring can be detrimental to their title fight.

No points are awarded for pole or fastest lap.

Position | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th |
:- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
Points | 75	| 67 | 60 | 54 | 49 | 45 | 42 | 39 | 36 | 33

Position | 11th | 12th | 13th | 14th | 15th | 16th | 17th | 18th | 19th | 20th |
:- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
Points | 30	 | 28	| 26 | 24 |22 | 20 | 18 | 16 |14 |12 |

Position | 21st | 22nd | 23rd | 24th | 25th | 26th | 27th | 28th | 29th | 30th |
:- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
Points | 10	| 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1

Winning all three races nets the driver a possible 225 points, so it can be easy to see why retiring from a few races will ruin a season for a driver.

####**Car Specs**

As the name suggests, Toyota have been the only engine supplier for the series since its inception. Tatuus took up the roll of creating a chassis for the engine back in 2005 with the TT104ZZ and has only recently updated the car to the current FT-50.

The FT-50 is built to FIA F3 standards and takes a lot of influence from the F3 rules in the case of bodywork and parts. Michelin have supplied their F3 tyres for the series since 2015.

An interesting aspect about the car is that since 2008, the cars engine has been tuned to run on 85 percent ethanol biofuel. This was done by the organisers to make the series more green and not impact the New Zealand ecosystem as much.

*^^^I ^^^really ^^^have ^^^no ^^^idea ^^^who ^^^supplied ^^^tyres ^^^for ^^^the ^^^first ^^^car, ^^^someone ^^^help ^^^please*

####**Champions**

As of the start of the 2016 Formula One season, only 2 drivers have previously raced in the Toyota Racing Series: Will Stevens and Daniil Kvyat.

Other drivers that have competed in the series have also gone on to race in categories such as GP2, LMP1 and V8 Supercars.

Hopefully this will give people a good idea about the series. It starts again this weekend (actually it's underway right now, Wednesday practice and all). 

Coverage of the series is usually down to just live timing but last year they uploaded little highlights of each and every race so hopefully they'll do it again this year.

If I've missed out on anything or gotten something wrong don't hesitate to correct me. 

I'll be looking forward to these next 5 weekends with interest!

Statement is on Page 3.

This basically means that practically every driver in the past god knows how long was eligible for a super license anyway (except Verstappen and Stevens), so the points system has effectively become more useless than it already is.

Realistically, unless they make it higher than 40, it's not really that difficult for a driver who is in a position to be in F1 to get the points.

Mind you this is the first time I've heard of this change, but then again the FIA haven't even brought out the regulations for the super license points in the first place.

A lot of drivers we love don't have the luxury of having someone update a wikipedia page for them, so having a database that keeps track of pretty much every drivers entire career including karting is a real help for us.

There's different sections on the site that include their 'ranking' system of drivers, active female drivers and even there 'best drivers under 22'. Today I'll be focusing on the 'Popularity' section.

Popularity specifically tracks the amount of times a drivers page was viewed within a week and changes daily. So with that, we can analysis who's been the talk of the town and for what reason.

#####1 - Rio Haryanto

No surprises here for Rio being the most viewed by nearly 100. A recent 'leaked' image of a form from the government of Indonesia wishing to purchase a seat for him at Manor next year would obviously bring him up into the lime light.

That said, Indonesian drivers are popular with fans, especially Rio. Gelael is sitting at 13th on the list while Triple P Armand sits at 16th.

Overall, it's fair to say that the combined popularity of Haryanto and the recent speculation for a Formula 1 driver put him firmly at the top of the list.

#####2 - Will Stevens

When I checked the list initially, I was surprised with him being a firm second. But why?

Well, the popularity index also includes times where two drivers have been put 'head to head' with results. And with him not having secured his seat at Manor next year, one can only assume that he's here for the same reason Haryanto is.

#####3 - Nathan Blok

I'll put my hand up and say I honestly had no idea who Nathan Blok was before this post. Turns out he's the 2015 champion for the Canadian F2000 series. 

Checkin his name on google didn't get any recent results other than his title, so perhaps he is here for that same reason, ""Who is he?""

#####4 - Max Verstappen

I've periodically checked the popularity list before but never have I not seen his name in the list. Verstappen being here is almost a formality. 

Chances are there's not real reason he is here other than being the most talked about Formula 1 rookie for a long time.

#####5 - Luis Leeds

It's amazing what being picked up by Red Bull will do for the coverage of your career, and I imagine this is why a lot of people have flocked to his page to see how good/bad he is and wether or not he deserves the spot on the team.

The same could be said of the other two Red Bull picks, with SS Câmara sitting joint 13th with Gelael on the list and Niko Kari sitting at 23rd.

Being picked up by Red Bull will probably be the main reason he is here, but he did also win the F4 support race at Mexico earlier this year.

#####6 - Luke Chudleigh &amp; Roger Barr

Chudleigh? No idea. The guy has a lot of articles about him via google, and he did do a few FR2.0 races this year, but for someone with zero wins to his name, it's hard to see why he's on the list.

Same could be said of Roger Barr, where it turns out that he hasn't raced since 1970. Weird. It's possible he might have died recently though, but nothing has turned up.

#####8 - Mick Schumacher

Back to reality with Schumacher in the list. I imagine the recent news from his uncle about forming an F4 team, and the recent comments from Nico Rosberg about the pressures he is under have put him in the top 10 again.

Though I'm sure we're all hoping that his second F4 season next year will go a lot better, I personally don't think the hype has affected him too much. Yet.

#####9 - Lewis Hamilton

Obligatory F1 champion in the list, though it is strange to find him here of all places. Perhaps a lot of people were checking his career out?

#####10 -  KYLE KELLY

I've got nothing, the guy has 1 race entered in his entire career on the site. And yet he's ahead of Stoffel Vandoorne in 11th.

---

So overall, it's possible that because it is the off-season that things are a little, weird, but I think it was a good idea to do this nonetheless.

Now that the season is essentially over, other than a few F4 and F3 races to go, I thought it was about time we consult the 'tier system' we had here for a bit.

It was essentially added in to help people distinguish where drivers will go once they step up the ladder, but I still don't feel confident at all about what it is at the moment, and I'm hoping we can sort it out.

Sure, we all know GP2 is at the top, but will the F35V8 series stay alongside it? Maybe it's a silly question but it gets even more complicated further down. Now that FR2.0 isn't the direct feeder to the F35V8 series, does it drop below F3 or GP3? 

So that's why I'll keep this as a mega-thread to help patch up the holes we have.

Not only that, but I'd also like to round up all the series we have missing from the list itself. I know that we're missing a tonne of series in the US including the Atlantics and Formula Lite series, so If you can think of ANY series that still is still going (not something like British F3), then please throw that in as well.

Also, where do series like the MRF Challenge and Toyota Racing Series fit in?

Anyway, here is what we have currently, and I'll update it as we go.

^2015 ^FIA ^Formula ^3 ^Intercontinental ^Cup

Welcome everybody to the 62nd running of the **Macau Grand Prix**!

This year marks the 33rd time the race has been run under the Formula Three rules. The winner of the race will officially be recognised as the champion of the **2015 FIA Formula 3 Intercontinental Cup**.

____

####**About**

The crown jewel of the feeder series world, the Macau Grand Prix is one of the most exciting, exhausting, and downright dangerous races in the motorsport world.

The comparisons to the Monaco Grand Prix are not without reason, and after looking at [the track](http://content.grandprix.gov.mo/uploads/Image/20100803_Press%20Release_photo1.jpg) one could say they are completely justified. 

The tight nature of the ‘Guia Street Circuit' as it sprawls over the streets of Macau lead to some interesting corners, including the famous crash prone [Lisboa Bend](http://bluebalu.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/58th-macau-grandprix-2011-7.jpg) and the 7 metre wide [Melco Hairpin](http://www.eurocarnews.com/media/pictorials/2456/15312.jpg).

It is every drivers dream to enter the race, with many wanting to etch their name into history by winning it. Because of its location, there is always a mix of the best talent across the world including those from the Americas, Europe and Asia.

Many current or former Formula One drivers have participated in the event early in their careers and some of them have won the prestigious prize. Famous winners include Riccardo Patrese, Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher, David Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher and Takuma Sato.

So far Italian driver Edoardo Mortara is the only one to have clinched victory twice. Felix Rosenqvist, 2015 FIA Formula 3 European Champion and 2014 winner of the Macau Grand Prix, is hoping to equal this record, but will have competition from Daniel Juncadella, who won the 2011 Macau Grand Prix and likewise wants to take a second FIA F3 Intercontinental Cup victory.

____

####**Weekend Format**

Over the course of the week, there will be two practice sessions, two qualifying sessions, the qualifying race and finally the main race. The best time drivers set over the two qualifying sessions decides their starting position for the qualifying race. 

The qualifying race is 10 laps on Saturday and decides the grid for the main race. The main race is then held over 15 laps on Sunday

####**Regulations**

Even though technically the remaining Formula 3 series allow different chassis manufacturers to enter into their championships, only the [Dallara F312](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7053/7057392461_82ae9e5068_z.jpg) or variants of the F312 car are allowed to be raced. This includes the F313, F314, F315 &amp; F316 models.

Any homologated FIA Formula 3 engine from 2012 onwards is allowed to be entered. Because of this, Macau often sees the highest amount of differing engine suppliers for any Formula 3 event. 

This years engine manufacturers include:

* Mercedes (13 Cars)
* Volkswagen (10 Cars)
* Toyota (4 Cars)
* Tomei (Nissan) (1 Car)

2014 engine manufacturers NBE and Toda will not be taking part in this years event.

___

####**Entry List/Eligibility**

To be eligble to enter the Macau Grand Prix, a driver must have raced in at least one Formula Three event over the current year. The following series allow entry:

* FIA Formula 3 European Championship
* Euroformula Open
* All-Japan Formula Three

Often, drivers from other series, both above and below Formula 3, will either step down or step up for one event to gain entry to the series. Sometimes drivers from other categories such as touring cars will do the same.

Although Tadasuke Makino did everything he could to catch up to Tsuboi in the final round this weekend by taking wins in both races, all Tsuboi had to do was finish at least second, which he did, to deny Makino the title by 3 points.

It's a real shame that this series isn't well covered outside of Japan, because the number of entrants tells us this was a really successful championship.

I said at the end of last year that I would review the current rules for this sub towards the start of the next season, so this was always going to happen.

**Anyway, here are the current rules: https://www.reddit.com/r/FormulaE/wiki/index/rules**

If there is anything there that needs changing, please write what you think in the comments below.

Likewise, if there is a rule that you think needs implemented, then also comment below.

I'll be setting the comments to contest mode so you can easily go through the rules/suggestions.

Closer towards the first round in about a months time, I'll take the most upvoted/discussed rule and then put them all to a vote (like we did with the spoiler rule). This will mean that we all get a say in what is going on.

If you see an idea that is similar to yours, just comment on that with your inclusions.

Hopefully that explains that, I'll be taking every comment seriously so I'll leave it to you guys for now.

Oh, and don't downvote unless it's really off-topic.

So my question is, what series should we properly cover this weekend? By properly cover I mean the usual big post with stats, information and starting grids.

I'm guessing a lot of people would agree that GP2/3 are important, and maybe FR3.5 as well.

But we can only sticky 2 posts at once, so it doesn't leave a lot of real estate on this subreddit.

I'm thinking a weekend post for FIA F3, and maybe just linking the streams of the F4/Euroformula series like we've done beforehand. Though they might go missing since they can't be stickied.

Thoughts?

So i'm running both Beta's on my apple hardware. El Capita Public Beta 3 on my MacBook (Late 2010, The White one), and IOS9 on my iPhone 4s.

I've only noticed this recently, but it seems that no book or epub file that I specifically sync works. itunes tells me it is syncing and shows the progress bar for it, but when I check to see if it is on the phone through itunes, I get the (!) symbol next to the book.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure what else to try. I don't particularly want to buy a book from the iBooks store to see if that will work but I will if that's a last resort.

If it helps, I am using Calibre to edit my books before importing them into iBooks/iTunes. Something I've always done and has worked up until now.

Any help would be appreciated, and if it's a no fix then that's fine too.

Edit: I made a quick book using Pages and that synced fine.",applehelp_betas,iTunes not syncing books after updating to iOS 9 beta.,http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp_betas/comments/3fmlaj/itunes_not_syncing_books_after_updating_to_ios_9/

723,2015-07-06 03:14:22+00:00,self.F1FeederSeries,https://www.reddit.com/r/F1FeederSeries/comments/3c9fki/australian_f4_townsville_session_times/,,"It's a bit late to be starting a series since we're already into the 6th month of 2015, but the Aussie F4 championship will be starting this weekend as a support series for the V8 SuperCar series.

So far we have 12 confirmed drivers, with a possible 13th for future races. It's not a lot I know but it's about twice the grid of the current Aussie F3 field so this is pretty healthy in that respect.

---

So, after scouring the net, I've found the session times for the events.

Keep in mind Queensland, Australia, is UTC+10:00 and does not have Daylight savings, so it might make thins a tiny bit difficult.

Nonetheless, here is the schedule.

Session | Time | Duration
:- | :- | :- 
Practice 1 | Fri 07:40 | 20""
Practice 2 | Fri 13:25 | 20""
Qualifying | Fri 15:20 | 20""
|||
Race 1 | Sat 08:35 | 11 laps / 20""
Race 2 | Sat 11:25 | 11 laps / 20""
|||
Race 3 | Sun 10:00 | 11 laps / 20""

---

All the sessions run for 20 minutes at the most (I think), this is probably because of how congested the V8 Supercar Weekend is.

Points awarded are the same as any other FIA sanctioned event, 25 for the win, 18 for second, so on so forth until 1 point for 10th.

5 points for pole position and 1 additional point for each fastest lap of the three races.

Grids are decided by:

Race 1: Fastest in Qualifying

Race 2: Reverse top 10 classified cars from Race 1

Race 3: Second fastest lap in Qualifying

Obviously there's a lot to improve with what can be shown here, but If you have any suggestions then please comment them.

That said, after being the (basically) sole moderator for this entire season, I feel like it would probably be a good idea to get a couple others on board. Won't be for anything major, just keeping everything in check, especially considering every race this year has been in the early morning for me.

So yeah, thanks everyone for support this subreddit and supporting this awesome series and lets hope these last two races go off down without a hitch!",FormulaE,/r/FormulaE suggestions thread!,http://www.reddit.com/r/FormulaE/comments/3ap5ev/rformulae_suggestions_thread/
