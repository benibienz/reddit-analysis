I do recognize that the efficacy of each style depends on the person doing it. My advice is to try every possible strategy until you find what works for you best.

Anxiety- The body is experiencing major changes that deplete it of energy very quickly. The central nervous system reacts to this heavy depletion by sending anxiety signals. I had no idea about this until I spoke to my therapist. I never would have thought the CNS would produce anxiety because of fatigue. I thought it was because I had developed GAD. 

Sleep- Sleep is crucial in the recovery process. The body and CNS restore themselves the most during sleep. 

Eating - Eating the right amount and type of food is imperative as well. This does not mean eating till you're full, but eating portions with enough essential nutrients.

Activity- habitual and productive activity for at least an hour a day. Don't try to overwork yourself at the beginning. I read a lot of posts that recommend staying extremely busy, putting in a lot of effort, and overworking yourself since day one. In my case, it only exacerbated my anxiety and made me break down at one point. Take it easy at first. Add intensity gradually.

Gradual increments vs Cold turkey- I could never go through with Cold turkey all at once. I had to chase the turkey, gut it, season it, and cook it. Deciding to completely cut off a habit which was gradually created is intense. Just like we didn't get addicted in one day, we probably won't cure ourselves in one attempt. This is especially true for those of us that have been doing this since early youth. Have patience and go by increments. For me, reaching 5 days was a nightmare at the beginning. For about 2 months I would follow a cycle of going 3-4 days clean, then relapse, then 3-4 days again, etc. Eventually this turned into 5-7, then 8-9, then 11-12. There were exceptional times when I went 13 or more days on a single streak, but after relapse, the earlier cycles of 8-9, 11-12 continued. Go as long as you can bear, but expect this to be gradual.",NoFap,Straight out of therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/52rkd4/straight_out_of_therapy/

""In other ways, pornography reveals men's insecurities with their own sexuality. Psychologists point out that much of what is portrayed in porno graph assuage men's fear of and disgust with their own semen; they need to see women revel in it and adore it in order to allay their own feelings of unattractiveness and discomfort. Many male performers are notoriously unattractive; this, too, feeds into men's fear and hidden desires. If the men were anything other than pathetic, unattractive , wooden and stupid, they could pose a competitive threat to the men who are watching. The viewer instead can imagine himself as ""better"" than his porno graphic counterpart, and thus can imagine inserting himself into the scene. After all, if a female porn star would stoop to this lunk, then surely she would be eager to be with him. Porno graph literally creates the man's world as he would ideally have it, free of exclusion, discomfort, stressful competition, and rejection.""

Pornography is chaining us down to a fantasy world where we are treated like helpless children. It gives to us without us having to put in any work in,  creating the perfect hideaway from reality. When we cant cope with the real world we come to this hideaway that reinforces our mediocrity through endless gratification.

Do you believe you are inherently valuable just because of the simple fact that you are you? Or do you believe value is an external thing?

Do you believe things have value because you give it to them? Or because others do?

Do you seek to make external value a part of you to gain other's approval? 

Odds are you rely on the external and follow this mindset.

- Because I think others find value in an external thing, I try to make that thing a part of me to get approval from others.

- I end up relying on that thing to feel value, since others see it as valuable

-I don't find value in it from my own approval, therefore I per se have low value.

- In reality, I perceive the thing to be of more value than me. I therefore rely on it as a crutch.

Remember that this sort of value will always be an abstract thing and that the external only has value because you give it this abstract value. The thing in itself will never be valuable. Therefore you must realize that you are priceless because you posses the ability to give value. You need to believe that you are inherently valuable. 

- My own value is given by myself. The value of the external is ultimately decided by me and my own approval.

Smoked some cannabis, which Im also trying to kick, and relapsed. I had a a very unusual experience though and came to a positive realization. I have been changing my habits along with Nofap (meditation, exercise, responsibility,  work and school ethic, instead of laziness and decadence) and honestly, being stoned all day and jerking off SUCKED. I felt like I wanted to do something the whole time but I lacked the energy and concentration. It was not fun, it was just a waste of time. Nofap has really helped me climb out of a deep ditch and feel the warmth of the light. I only jacked off once, so I am setting back my counter five days. I feel like shit, but I am somewhat at peace with it. Keep reaching high",NoFap,Day 17- Relapsed. What I learned,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4dt6k2/day_17_relapsed_what_i_learned/

Choking is the right word because the life was being sucked out of me. I have never been able to make past 7 days without masturbating or watching porn until now. I've been in nofap for well about 5 months, and the changes in my personality after this ten day streak are radical. I have always suffered from severe social anxiety and depression, which has made me value myself no more than a piece of pocket lint. After these ten days, accompanied with consistent exercise, healthy dieting,  and abstinence from marijuana, I have been able to excell in social situations. My tone of voice is louder when I speak, I don't look at all women as sexually as before, I can actually enjoy myself and partake in that dynamic energy of communication with another being. 

The rise to the streak was gradual, 3 days, relapse, 1 dda relapse, 2 days, relapse, and so on, until it became 5 days, 6 days, NOW 10!! YOU CAN'T QUIT COLD TURKEY, you have to chase that fucker down, stuff him, put him in the oven, etc. 

Going for a month, this website truly has been an illuminating staircase. Keep fighting to be the best you!
