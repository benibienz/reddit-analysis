0,60 and 72 a headshot switch to a shotgun and usually it's a free kill. That's usually what I do and my k/d was 5 in the beta lol. Just went 30-8 in a match with the same setup but with Combat Shotgun cause I think it's better than Super.,2016-05-15 18:50:25+00:00,d36kyo1,4,t1_d36kvvq,128,Doom

2,you can just use the Combat Shotgun to clean up because usually switching to Super and trying to clean up you might not get the kill and by the time you get that second shot off you're dead. Use the Combat shotgun and if you don't get the one hit cleanup you can easily shoot again because it's so much faster.,2016-05-15 18:22:51+00:00,d36jypb,2,t1_d36jg5g,853,Doom
3,what do you mean? I think it's one of the best weapons it might need a tad bit of a buff on ramp up time but not much at all because then it would be OP as hell.,2016-05-15 18:22:04+00:00,d36jxoa,2,t1_d36jl6b,574,Doom

14,so what I'm getting from all of this is if Agg Balls can lower your time to kill then just use it every single time. If these AA values did change and there is no real difference then there's no reason to not use Agg Balls (the stability decrease shouldn't discourage someone) it's barely noticeable.,2016-04-21 23:34:45+00:00,d2cdt3p,5,t1_d2ca0wn,5828,CruciblePlaybook

17,"If you hate the best weapons then you'll never get there because you'll usually end up playing someone that's better than you or same skill level as you using better weapons than you which translates to you losing as they will always have an advantage over you.

Same skill level same weapons = whoever plays better will win. Same skill level different weapons = whoever has better weapons will win.
Different skill levels same weapons = whoever has better weapons will usually win.

I don't care how hard you try you won't beat decent people using underpowered weapons. I mean maybe you'll win a couple rounds and even matches here and there but once you get up to 5-7 wins good luck bro.",2016-04-21 19:11:02+00:00,d2c2kyo,1,t3_4fo8js,95376,CruciblePlaybook

173,"Just got the bag today and I'm actually pretty surprised I ordered Sunday night and the roasted day is from the 24th, usually don't get my coffee roasted from that long so. Oh well sure it tastes good still just gotta drink it faster I guess :/ I'll let ya know how it is, trying it with my chemex first ",2015-07-02 18:38:47+00:00,csq4yeh,2,t1_csovhfc,91608,Coffee
174,"you don't get to decide what people spend their money on, you have the game and you're probably bored of it so you're using that knowledge telling the kid ""ahh it will be a quick wait it's not that bad"" but he never probably even played the game before. Imagine all the fun he could have and all the stuff he could do in that 2 months. Yes for us veteran players the game is pretty stale (for me at least, I've done pretty much everything there's nothing else I can really strive for) but for him he would have so much stuff to do 2 months probably might not even be enough time to do it all. You're just another crappy Gamestop employee, brainwashed into thinking customers are just profit sticks.  ",2015-07-01 08:32:18+00:00,csoi4pr,3,t1_csnyhwm,42560,DestinyTheGame

La Colombe and Todd Carmichael got me started with my awesome journey into real coffee goodness. I used to have a Hario Cold Brew thing where you just slap grinds in and put in the fridge overnight, but when they put this video out I instantly tried this method, and oh boy it was amazing. The flavors the brew had were off the chart, definitely give this a try! 

If you don't wanna watch it here's TL;DR: He uses a French Press and leaves it out in room temperature, no fridge involved. ",2015-07-01 07:33:09+00:00,csoh75w,1,t3_3bo9xh,39778,Coffee
176,"Gonna be honest I used everything except a v60 but a good point to add is that the coarser you get the more fines there will be so that could actually be making your problem worse. I've had an Encore for a couple months now and it works perfect for my Chemex, they recommend a #21 and that actually comes out pretty fast for 450g-700g of water.

178,"Sorry but I'm not going to refuse to buy a game that I want to actually play because of this. I'd rather have a good game to buy and get screwed over than to have nothing to play at all.

Besides, you're all crying over a couple of dance moves and whatnot. Like really, get over yourselves. You're not entitled to shit.",2015-06-23 00:16:32+00:00,csfd5nz,1,t3_3artov,82,DestinyTheGame

The radar perk is great, but the other body to headshot damage perk is not needed since it has such a high impact it's already a 2 burst kill.

188,Just because there aren't a lot of words to it doesn't mean it's a low effort post. It's simple and effectively explains how broken the game is when new content won't really be sought after because Bungie made a whole class of weapons so terrible no one wants to use them.,2015-06-16 19:38:17+00:00,cs8poln,2,t1_cs8pis5,237,DestinyTheGame

194,I've gotten to the lighthouse on all 3 of my characters each time it's been out. I've gotten all the rewards from it basically. Once you go 9-0 there's no reason to do it on the same character and I can get 9-0 in like 3 hours on all my characters even though the game type lasts from Friday to reset. They need to add incentive to play it more. They should add rep for Trials and when you get past rank 3 you start getting packages like everything else.,2015-06-16 07:22:47+00:00,cs85bra,2,t1_cs858k1,328,DestinyTheGame
