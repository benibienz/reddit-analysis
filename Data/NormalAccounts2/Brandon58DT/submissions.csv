Went to the shop and for some reason one of the .5 coils was missing and the one inside of it looked nasty so the guys gave me a .3 and a .4 coil and clearly the .3 isn't going to work with my mod setup, so I'm totally going back and asking for something else.

But the .4 ohm coil should work with my setup as it says it should run from 25-30w but I'm honestly not digging what I'm getting from it.

I try to really stretch my pouring technique out (I have a Hario Buono) but if I wait too long all of the water will pour of of the grinds and they will be sitting out to dry. 

After reading many articles I'm pretty sure that 4 minutes with a 6 cup Chemex is the average time that it should take for a ""perfect"" brew. I'm also using 450g of water so it's not the amount on why it's going so fast. Even if I use 600+ it still only takes 3 mintues for everything to finish.

I wanna actually have a legit discussion on why they have not been touched in so long.

I'm finally starting to get that staleness in my mouth with the game, after playing it for so many hours. 

I'm a big PvP guy, and using the same weapons over and over is getting really boring anymore. 

I know you can say ""well try Auto Rifles or something else to make it more challenging!"" I actually do that, but I shouldn't have to.

I don't see why Bungie cannot just revert the nerf because then that way everything else has been buffed. This wouldn't be a buff to Auto Rifles it would just be putting them to where they were at before everything else got buffed as well.

I believe it was a 2.5% damage nerf to ARs, even if they buffed the damage to 1.5% or 2%, I don't see how they could be SO much more overpowered than Hand Cannons.

Has anyone gotten a real answer from Bungie yet on this?
