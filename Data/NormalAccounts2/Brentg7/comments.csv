It flies like a big airplane but has a very basic flight control system with no hydraulic boost (or power steering) so you have to kind of muscle it around. It definitely lumbers a bit when carrying heavy loads. It's also unique in that we always have the flight engineer set our power for us, even during landings, which takes a little getting used to. This is because it would be almost impossible to both horse the heavy flight controls around AND manipulate the power levers at the same time.""

No finer place for sure, downtown

581,"Air Force Clarifies A-10 Retirement Plans



Defense NewsMarch 18, 2016Lara Seligman

Amid some confusion over when the Air Force will retire the A-10 attack plane, top service officials this week clarified the plan to start drawing down Warthog squadrons in fiscal 2018.

Comments from Defense Secretary Ash Carter in early February seemed to indicate the Air Force would postpone divesting the A-10 until fiscal 2022. In a speech previewing the budget release, Carter noted commanders' demand for the A-10 and other fourth-generation aircraft in the fight against the Islamic State.

“The budget defers the A-10’s final retirement until 2022, replacing it with F-35s on a squadron-by-squadron basis so we’ll always have enough aircraft for today’s conflict,” Carter said Feb. 2.

However, the Air Force will actually begin sunsetting the beloved attack plane in FY18, divesting two A-10 squadrons, or 49 planes, that year, a service spokeswoman confirmed March 17. The service will retire 49 aircraft in FY19, 64 in FY20, and 96 in FY21.

The decision to retire the A-10 beginning in FY18 was purely budget-driven, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in response to questions from Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., during a March 16 hearing of the House Armed Services Committee. The multirole F-35 has been billed as an across-the-board replacement for all of the Air Force’s legacy fighter jets, but the F-35 cannot match the A-10 as a single-mission close-air support (CAS) platform, officials have said.

“The F-35 is intended to the high-threat CAS platform,” Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh said during the hearing. “We are losing CAS capacity, that’s what the Budget Control Act has done to us.”

The plan to begin divesting squadrons in FY18 is key to supporting the Air Force’s standup of the F-35, Welsh explained. Over the past few years, the Air Force has established “workarounds” to keep up with the demands of sustaining both the A-10 and standing up the F-35, including contracting out maintenance work to industry. However, those resources run out in FY18, Welsh said. If the Air Force keeps the full A-10 fleet flying into the next decade, the service will only have half the manpower it needs to field the F-35 when it is scheduled to reach full operational capability (FOC) in FY21, he stressed.

“In FY18 all those things kind of run out and we’re now short people to stand up F-35 units,” Welsh said. “If we keep the A-10, by FY21 — the scheduled FOC date for the F-35 — we will be about 50 percent short of the maintenance manpower we need to field the F-35. So it’s a manpower problem.”

The Pentagon’s top weapons tester will pit the full-up F-35 against the A-10 and potentially other aircraft during comparative tests slated for 2018. During the hearing, McSally, a retired Air Force colonel with 325 hours flying the A-10 in Iraq and Afghanistan, urged James and Welsh to wait to begin divesting the A-10 until this testing and analysis is complete.

“Our perspective is we shouldn’t put one more A-10 in the Boneyard [Davis-Monthan Air Force Base] until this test is complete and we actually have a report to assess those sort of risks and then we move forward,” McSally said.

900," This is a very weird situation. 'Cause I don't know if you remember back in '86 there was a major fucking drought. Nobody had anything. People were living on resin... -smoking the wood in their pipes for months. This chick had a bunch. And she's begging me to sell it. So I told her I wasn't going to be Joe the potman anymore, but I would take a little bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends. She agreed to that, said we'd keep the same arrangement as before; 10%, free pot for me, as long as I helped her out that weekend. She had a brick of weed she was selling, she didn't want to go to the buy alone. Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly. What for? His traffic tickets. Got a warrant. They stopped him for something, found warrants on him, took him to county. Now she doesn't walk around alone with all that weed. I don't want to do this. I have a very bad feeling about it. But she keeps asking me, keeps asking me, keeps asking me, finally I said OK 'cause I'm sick of hearing it. Now, we're picking the guy up at the train station... 
The guy needed it right away. Don't ask me why. Anyway, we're get to the station and we're waiting for the guy. I'm carrying the weed in one of those little carry-on bags. I got to take a piss. So I tell the connection I'll be right back, I'm going to the boys' room. So I walk in the mens' room, and who's standing there? Four Los Angeles county sheriffs and a German shepherd. they're just a bunch of cops hanging out in the men's room, talking. When I walked through the door, they all stopped what they were talking about and they looked at me. German shepherd starts barking. He's barking at me. I mean, it's obvious. He's barking at me. Every nerve-ending, all my senses, blood in my veins, everything I have is screaming, ""Take off, man! Just bail, just get the fuck out of there!"" Panic hits me like a bucket of water. First there's the shock of it--BAM, right in the face. I'm standing there drenched in panic. All these sheriffs looking at me, and they know, man. They can smell it. Sure as that fucking dog can, they can smell it on me.

Cop to dog- SHUT UP!!!

Edit: Hydrazine is highly toxic, and dangerously unstable in the anhydrous form. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency:

Symptoms of acute (short-term) exposure to high levels of hydrazine may include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, dizziness, headache, nausea, pulmonary edema, seizures,coma in humans. Acute exposure can also damage the liver, kidneys, andcentral nervous system. The liquid iscorrosive and may produce dermatitisfrom skin contact in humans and animals. Effects to the lungs, liver,spleen, and thyroid have been reported in animals chronically exposed to hydrazine via inhalation. Increased incidences of lung, nasal cavity, and liver tumors have been observed in rodents exposed to hydrazine.[42]

Limit tests for hydrazine in pharmaceuticals suggest that it should be in the low ppm range.[43] Hydrazine may also cause steatosis.[44] At least one human is known to have died after 6 months of sublethal exposure to hydrazine hydrate.[45]

On February 21, 2008, the United States government destroyed the disabled spy satellite USA 193 with a sea-launched missile, reportedly due to the potential danger of a hydrazine release if it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere intact.
