224,"Hi! Thanks for reaching out to me.

So how the website works is you sign up and you get an email address, username@socialmail.com and whenever you are on a deals website you sign up for those deals using the email address. So let's say I want to buy something from Old Navy, or I want to sign up for their newsletter which includes weekly coupons. I want those coupons, but I could do without scrolling through the email to find the deals and I hate getting promotional deals through my personal email address. That's where Socialmail comes in. It puts all of your deals that you signed up for in one location- on Socialmail.com or our app. But they're no longer emails, they are a collection of visual coupons (with images) on your screen in a Pinterest like way. You're not longer having to look at an email, but more of a scroll that takes all the info from your emails in one place. 

You can go on the website and have a look to experience it!  Our website and app are both free, we don't get our revenue from the users. 

This is a different experience than spam filters or for example the promotions tab in Gmail. For instance, we carefully designed the UI on the app and website so that looking at your emails is a visual treat, rather than the boring format we're used to in emails. Spam filters make it so you won't see emails at all, and that's not our intention. This website is to make the marketing emails you want always visible, and the ones you don't want we make sure you're unsubscribed. ",2016-03-02 22:12:17+00:00,d0l9zux,2.0,t1_d0l7bnb,3294.0,deals

Dogs are wild animals that we domesticated for companionship, but their entire lives revolve around their human, so being considerate to the dog means the world to them.

I know every single visa, both UK and US, inside out. There are so many visas, yet every single one on both sides of the country are so very hard to obtain.

I just finished doing graduate school in the UK and I had to leave a couple months after the program finished. They changed it recently so that you can no longer stay a year after completing your degree.

Even if they got married, the UK citizen has to make at least 18k (£) a year to prove that he can support the immigrated spouse. 

There's also a partner's visa, but you have to live together for two years before applying and the money rule still applies.

in 1911 certain types of black and red currants were banned from being grown in NY and other states in the US.

Also, the climate in the UK and Europe is considered more conducive to a good currant crop.

Use countdown apps for your phone to have a countdown for when you'll see each other next. Skype and FaceTime when you can. Write emails to each other to keep each other in the loop. If you're in a different time zone, write her an email to wake up to, or to go to sleep to.

Second, the sample size was quite small, also, some of the students refused to participate in this study. The reasons were, doubtful of the confidentiality of the study, some reasoned that the questionnaire was too personal, and few did not answer the question completely. There could be some dishonesty in answering personal questions.
