The results came back normal. Two days later I woke up with extremely bad flank pain and upper abdominal pain. Both of these pains are persisting today. I've seen the doctor that did the endoscopy since this, and he denies that it could be from the Endoscopy and has sent me to a Urologist who came up with nothing, and a Primary care doctor that thought maybe it's my gallbladder. 

Before my endoscopy, I was in good health. The reason I had an endoscopy is because 2 years ago I began getting really bad heartburn. He wanted to do an endoscopy to make sure that there was nothing wrong in my esophagus.
Last Saturday I went to the ER because of the pain I was in. They gave me two shots of pain killers in the bum and sent me on my way, of course not before billing me $300. What a waste.
Since the 25th I've spent close to $900 in copays trying to figure out what the hell is going on. I recently found a study done where they found that 47% of patients who had an upper endoscopy then had abdominal pain.
On Thursday I had an Ultrasound and they didn't find anything. Then I had a hida scan for my gallbladder and they found nothing.

Friday I had a CT scan and they found....nothing.

Where the pain is located: about three inches below my right breast. It feels like someone is sticking me with a spoon from the inside. It's very unpleasant and seems to hurt no matter what. Sometimes the pain moves about my abdomen but it primarily rests on the upper right. 


Current medical conditions: acid reflux (handled with Protonix), Hypothyroid handled with Levothyroxine and Zocor for cholesterol.
Originally my Primary care thought maybe it could also be a UTI, and she gave me a 7 day course of bactrim, which did nothing.
Sometimes I also have referred pain in the left lower abdomen, and I always have referred pain in my upper back near my shoulder blade (right side) and lower back parallel to the stomach pain under my breast.
ANY help or advice is appreciated. I'm in so much pain and I'm continuing to work and such, but I have broken down crying at work lately because of it all.
Thanks in advance, guys. I really do appreciate it.

Hi there, I'm a 29 year old girl looking for housing somewhere along the peninsula. I'd love to be in Redwood City but I'm flexible. My budget is about $750, and I'm hoping to get a private room. Everything else I'm happy to share! I do have a sweet dog who is about 9 years old. He's very mellow and loves everyone he meets, except for cats. He's medium sized, roughly 50 pounds, so having a place with some sort of outdoor area would be a huge plus!

A little more about me: I'm a full time florist, part time nanny and night student. My days are usually pretty full, but when I'm around the house I love cooking, gardening and painting. I never smoke and rarely drink, but don't mind if my housemates do.

Feel free to reach out!

It's a free app/website.

So how the website works is you sign up and you get an email address, username@socialmail.com and whenever you are on a deals website you sign up for those deals using the email address. So let's say I want to buy something from Old Navy, or I want to sign up for their newsletter which includes weekly coupons. I want those coupons, but I could do without scrolling through the email to find the deals and I hate getting promotional deals through my personal email address. That's where Socialmail comes in. It puts all of your deals that you signed up for in one location- on Socialmail.com or our app. But they're no longer emails, they are a collection of visual coupons (with images) on your screen in a Pinterest like way. You're not longer having to look at an email, but more of a scroll that takes all the info from your emails in one place.
You can go on the website and have a look to experience it! Our website and app are both free, we don't get our revenue from the users.
This is a different experience than spam filters or for example the promotions tab in Gmail. For instance, we carefully designed the UI on the app and website so that looking at your emails is a visual treat, rather than the boring format we're used to in emails. Spam filters make it so you won't see emails at all, and that's not our intention. This website is to make the marketing emails you want always visible, and the ones you don't want we make sure you're unsubscribed.

I can't physically see anything, I can just feel pressure. I've tried several things-floss, floss with knots in it to try and pull it through, toothpicks, those flossing stick things. The main problem is not only can I not narrow down to one specific area (because it's about 3 teeth and gumsthat hurt) and the only thing I seem to be doing is tearing up my gums.

Watercolors

  

**What are you working towards-What are your goals? E.g (The type of style (realism, manga, western), people-characters-landscape etc.)**  

  
Realism, for sure. I want to make what I paint realistic looking, with a bit of original stylization.

  

**Are you looking for a buddy of a similar level or something more advanced? (N.B. you can have more than one buddy, so if you feel like you want both then leave this question blank)**  

  
Honestly I would prefer someone more advanced because when I show them my work they can look at it and clearly identify my strong areas and of course, and more importantly, my weak areas. I just want to learn as much as I can. I'm self taught so I seriously don't know what I'm doing. I'm also really hard to offend so if you tell me that I'm doing something wrong I will not be upset, I will be grateful that you're taking the time to point it out to me.

  Fairly often-I paint daily, so every other day?

 You know, I don't really mind so much. Any form of communication is okay with me. I'm flexible.

For whatever reason I am under the impression that I must wash my hands after touching something that isn't either my bed or laptop, because they are ""safe havens"" that I only touched after I've showered. 

My reasoning behind the fear of germs is that they are everywhere, they are 'dangerous,' and if I'm clean of them I cannot be harmed.


I realize this isn't the usual CMV post, they're usually strong opinions that can be swayed. I'm not sure if anyone will be able to change my mind, but if they can I will be grateful.

When I say she's my professor, I mean she's the co-ordinator for my masters degree in my specific field. 

She is very unprofessional. She has singled me out several times in class for things that everyone else does. She failed me on an assignment that was worth 100% of a class. When I appealed the score she gave me, I went from a D to a B, after two other professors agreed that the D she gave me was not worthy.

Fast forward to now, I'm doing my dissertation. It's due in two weeks and I asked her a question about formatting due to the answer not being in our program's handbook. She flat out told me that the answer was not in the handbook, but it was common sense. Before asking her I asked other peers and supervisors, but my personal supervisor is on vacation until 3 days before my paper is due. 

This is not the first time she has been unprofessional and rude. I have tried to meet with the head of the department on several occasions, but it's a joke. Overall this university has been complete shit when it comes to dealing with students. I'm at a loss as to what I can do about this unruly professor treating people like shit. Although she targets me, there is one other student from a previous semester that she treated similarly, but he never did anything about it. 
   
TL;DR my professor and co-ordinator is unprofessional and crass every chance she gets, singles me out and makes me feel like shit. University department head doesn't care. What do I do ?
