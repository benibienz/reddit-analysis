And regarding your other point about overwhelming the child with a different family, culture/country/and language: exactly my feelings and fears.
I really just wanted someone with real life experience to confirm for me that it's too much to expect from a child so I didn't feel like I was abandoning said child to age out of an orphanage in their own country. Because right now I think that's the way he sees it. He's not being realistic about the challenges that child will face, although it's coming from a good place. He just wants to take these kids into our home and love them.",2016-11-01 19:03:27+00:00,d9h7r9q,4.0,t1_d9h3nua,4708.0,Adoption
8,"I would not want to move to that child's country of birth because we don't speak the language, I have a serious inability to learn foreign languages (I have tried, in my lifetime, to learn french, spanish, and latin and despite constant tutoring and study I cannot retain even a preschoolers vocabulary. However, i did do really well learning american sign lanuage and teach my husband phrases all the time), my husband really enjoys the job he has here, and in many cases women in many of these countries are treated as second class citizens- something I don't put up with well even in my own country.

That last part is also a huge concern for me. I have several Asian family members but none of them live nearby and other then that handful it's just white all around. I actually brought this problem up to my husband as a concern because I went to college with a girl that was adopted from Colombia and she had very serious issues over being a different race from her family as does my brother in law who was adopted from Korea. But when I tried to voice these concerns to my husband he said i was essentially saying i wouldn't adopt a child based on skin color and I felt like an asshole. I know this concern is valid but when my husband points out young girls from India who aren't being placed because her nose is too wide or her skin too dark it's easy to say, ""This is ridiculous- lets adopt that child"".",2016-11-01 17:00:10+00:00,d9h1c1d,2.0,t1_d9h0ln3,837.0,Adoption
9,"I could have phrased that differently- I certainly don't want to give the impression that I think adopting an older child is selfish. I can tell you know what I meant, my mind was on the immediate shock and confusion stage for the kid.

I think 2 would be an age I would be comfortable with in the case of international adoption because you have a couple years before school starts but my worry is if the child is 5 or any older then how much more traumatizing is the situation going to be when they are put into kindergarten before they have a chance to get used to a new country and language?
But in the reading I have done so far the typical age for children available (non special needs/internationally) are around 5 and domestically I know for a fact it's 8 and up going through the state because my husband and I are currently taking adoption classes through CBC.

Can I ask where you adopted from and how long you had to wait for a child that young?",2016-11-01 15:52:03+00:00,d9gxsnk,2.0,t1_d9gvoi6,2499.0,Adoption

11,"Thanks! It's something we really want to do, defiantly not for the check lol My husband even asked about fostering and just not taking the money at all because he did the math and it comes to around $18 a day which is so insignificant he feels like it's not even worth collecting but the class instructor made a good point about not thinking of the money as ours, but the child's. 
 Our classes are very good, I feel. I have read some complaints in the foster parent sites that their classes really didn't prepare them for the realities of fostering but ours are very thorough and our instructor repeats a lot of things over and over about if we aren't there to work toward the goal of reunification- don't foster. And that it's not their job to find a kid for us it's about finding the right family for that particular kid. People need to know that going in. I feel like the couples looking to foster get that but those in the class for adoption need some reality checks.
I think some people go into it, not really for the money so much as the gratitude of the child like they are gonna react like a happy thankful Little Orphan Annie and that's just bizarre to me on a couple levels. One being that they really expect the child to be grateful when they would rather be with their bio family and Two, how broken are you that you need a kid kissing your ass?

Anyway- I was thinking about what you were writing about difficulty forming relationships with people and feeling like you are faking it a lot of the time. I can definitely empathize with that and you have a lot of reasons to feel like this. I haven't been through half of what you have and I struggle with it myself. And sometimes there is the rare person that I desperately want to be friends with but continuing that friendship and keeping in touch with them is so overwhelming and as you said- ""a chore"".
I think first you have to ask yourself, are you comfortable being a loner or does this state bother you because you feel like you should be different? It's healthy to have a support system- totally. No man is an island and all that. But you shouldn't feel like crap about being a certain way just because you feel like you are supposed to be different.",2016-10-20 12:47:52+00:00,d907lgh,3.0,t1_d8xmwrs,149685.0,fostersurvivor
12," No one has commented on this so I thought I would even though I am not a foster kid. I am actually in this group because my husband and I are currently taking classes to be foster parents and I am far more interested in opinions and the things ex foster kids bring up than I am in what foster parents say...
 Surprisingly, with all four of these we have a lot in common although the reasoning behind it was different. I had a crippling anxiety disorder as a child and moved constantly due to my dad being in the military so I missed out on the same things. For instance with sleepovers, I would have panic attacks and cry until my parents picked me up. I was not well liked among other parents and considered weird and high maintenance. If I do get the greenlight to foster, I can definitely see sleep overs as an issue because if the child has any kind of anxiety issues from trauma , which of course is likely, I would be very protective and want to shield my foster kid from adults that overreact and show a lot of frustration. I needed patience and comfort not eyerolling from my friend's parents, the dumb jerks. 
But why not have sleepovers at your house where your foster parents have more control? That seems like such an easy solution. I have no idea why my parents didn't do that for me or why your foster parents didn't think of that either.",2016-10-18 18:44:02+00:00,d8xlby5,1.0,t3_54gqtd,1983589.0,fostersurvivor
13,"Hi! I have also just started the process- waiting for classes to start so you are ahead of me. I am taking in the same age group and the social worker I spoke to said we need a crib AND a child's bed. Maybe it's different where you are but if you haven't had your home inspection yet i would definitely ask about that. You dont want to have the inspection and then wait for a second one if they tell you you need more than a crib, you know? I saw that you said you have a crib that can turn into a child's bed so I assume you are only taking one at a time (also our plan) but the social worker still told us we need both. 

I am also having the worst time not buying too much. Like your wife I am a total nester and i plan to make the kid's room a forest theme and I saw the cutest most amazing little fox toys and was dying to get them but I had to really show some self control.",2016-09-23 14:44:51+00:00,d7yw75t,3.0,t1_d7yu0p1,3129.0,fosterit

Is a receiving blanket the same as those swaddling blankets?

17,"How are you with animals? Are sitting for them an option where you live? I did this for over a year and it worked well for me. I would get overwhelmed a lot but it's not nearly as bad as a job out of the house.
I signed up with a few different online pet sitting services. Dogacay.com was one of them. you can have people drop off their dogs to your place so you never have to leave. Your interaction with the people is limited to drop off and pick up and animal lovers tend to be less judgemental.
I'm not going to sit here and try to talk you out of a possible body dysmorphic disorder you may have to make you think you are so ugly people are giving you dirty looks and just hating you for existing. I'm not a therapist and that's not my job. But as a person that goes out into the world i can tell you with total certainty that people don't just shoot nasty looks and hate a person for being unattractive. Doesn't happen in real life- that's an internet culture thing. MAYBE with teenagers, but that is the only time I would ever imagine that happening in person. I'm sure it's very real to you. I'm convinced everyone in a car wants to kill me. But no matter how real that is to me I have to accept it as part of my mental illness and not reality.

But I think the vocational rehab should be the first place to start. My dog sitting suggestion is really just a plan B.

20,"Yeah...
I mean it started in a ridiculous way. i got on her bad side through pure ignorance of social behavior due to my isolation. My panic attacks started at 5 and i was diagnosed with agoraphobia at 15 so as you can imagine i was (and still am to some point) socially and emotionally behind my peers.
So what happened was I worked at a dog kennel. there is a lane we walk between the cages and we were cleaning them out while the others walked said dogs. i walk past her and was daydreaming so I was walking too close and my hip lightly bumped her. She says, ""Did you just grab my ass??"" and not picking up on the ques of actual anger i thought she was joking with me so i laughed and said, 'sure did!' trying to act like... normal. Well she thought i was serious- i thought she was joking and from that point on her hatred for me grew more intense by the day and since i didn't have the social skills to make friends i became the odd girl out in everything. i could do no right and my co-workers talked about me a lot when they thought i was out of hearing distance.

95,"I am currently seeing a doctor that uses mindfulness techniques for our therapy in treating my anxiety/agoraphobia so I feel like I can shed some light here.
Mindfulness is not just ignoring the problem and pretending it's not there. That's a misconception. In the case of using it to treat anxiety you are using mindfulness in order to not spin out of control and make the anxiety worse or last longer.
Example: Lets say I am in a mall. There are too many people, the lights are too bright, panic is rising. My anxiety brain wants to overload on all these sensory images and it's yelling at me  YOU ARE UNSAFE! FIND THE UNSAFE THING! EMERGENCY! and so my brain will take in every single thing around me and have a panic attack. This isn't calmly exploring what it is that is causing the attack and finding the root cause. One mindfulness technique i would use in this situation is to count five things i can see as i take deep breaths. Four things I can hear, three things i can smell, two things I can touch, and 1 thing I can taste. By concentrating on one thing at a time i am calming my brain (obviously this takes a lot of practice to work). i am giving my brain something to experience and getting it off the current track it's on. later, when I am in a safe place i have the option of thinking, 'what was it about that situation that made me feel anxiety?' 

When you are having an anxiety attack you can't logically and reasonably find the root cause- that's just not going to happen. Your anxiety brain is lying to you and telling you it's looking for the danger but the problem is anxiety brain sees everything as danger.


Another situation: i am walking the dog. Again I feel panic at being out of my house. I know I am safe, but I start to panic anyway because that's what my brain has trained itself to do. I concentrate on the bottom of my feet. This one is kind of strange but it's effective. i feel the ground as i walk, the gentle pressure of my weight. I am in the present moment and not letting my anxiety brain take over. that is a form of mindfulness. It's your mind learning, ""Right now you are right here and everything is safe. That is reality. The other thoughts trying to get through are your anxiety brain and it's simply not true.""

In preforming these exercises you are literally rewiring your brain- not 'ignoring the problem' The actual problem is the fact that your anxiety spins out of control in situations where you are completely safe. In the long term, with a lot of practice- is certainly is a solution. In the meantime it is a healthy way of coping (there are healthy and unhealthy ways of coping with anxiety).

I do dog sit out of my home from time to time but it's not like I am significantly contributing to the family income with it so i don't really count it. I am lucky to be married to a man that is able to be the sole provider but when we were engaged I was working at Sears Photo and having regular meltdowns and very suicidal and he was delivering pizzas. Sears Photo went out of business and so we talked about me just staying home and being a house wife to see if we could make it work.
It was hard. We were literally dumping coins on the table every month and counting them out to make rent (note: tip your delivery guy!!! they LIVE on tips!).
I have an A.S in photographic technology (There was a period of time where my agoraphobia was at it's lowest and I was able to go to college which was great) and through this degree I learned some fantastic networking skills. So using these i was able to send out resumes and emails to get my SO an interview at a software company and he nailed the interview and now we don't have to worry about money at all. In fact we make enough that i can afford Cognitive behavioral Therapy (which is the only thing that has ever worked for me)

SO glad to hear my other plants aren't at risk though. That is a huge relief to me.

My tomato actually was a cherry and a hybrid as well which I read are both blight resistant so this must have been some crazy strong blight to get me. Also I had no idea what it was so I wasn't treating them or even picking off the affected leaves. I thought it was a vitamin deficiency and got plant food, then assumed the Florida sun was too much so I got it muslin for some shade... The plant kept getting worse so I tried to look up what could be wrong but all the diseases look the same to my amateur eye.

Anyway- thanks so much for all the info. I do have one last question you may be able to help with. It's rain season here in Florida and we get these short but very intense storms which I'm sure helps blight spread. Is it common to have some kind of tarp or other cover people run out and throw over the garden bed to protect from rains? Surely something permanent isn't used because any cover that would keep water out also shades them from the sun.

If she is newly feminist this is a stage a lot of people go through. Sort of like being a born again christian. You really have to find your true self and have a hard time not taking it to the extreme.
Switch roles for a moment. You are drinking and having a good time and she says to you, ""Hey, maybe try to get some sleep soon so you're not so hungover when I get there"". Is this ok? And if you started yelling at her saying ""don't tell me what to do!"" you know what you would be? An asshole. She's being an asshole. I don't think she means to be but if you shouldn't be talking to her that way then she should not be talking to you that way. That is actual gender equality. Respect on both ends.
Now when you confront her about this I highly suggest using ""When you said _____, I felt _____"". If she cares about you she will care about how her words made you feel. Though expect her to be very defensive at first. It's hard to accept when you have been a jerk.

When I met my now husband, I was (and still am a feminist of course) not only a feminist but i was one that had very limited contact with men. And there were a lot of kinks to work out at first because I just was not used to being with the opposite gender and I genuinely had trouble seeing his side of things but eventually we worked that out.

I was a goth kid (never completely grew out of it but have toned it down). I was getting bullied badly at school. Honestly, I was being bullied before the goth clothes but when I told my dad what was happening he said the problem was me and I should try harder to look like everyone else. When I stood my ground and continued to wear the clothes I liked and the bullying continued he took all my clothes away from me. He didn't think this through very well because it left me with nothing but what I was wearing and certainly didn't expect me to literally tear apart his bedroom to find them. My point being, this is an age where she is going to try to figure out who she is and it's important to be encouraging and accepting of that. In his own way my dad was trying to protect me but the message he was sending me was, 'you are the problem, those kids are right to treat you like that'.
She's going to listen to really terrible music and idolize morons and you have to just keep saying, 'i love you, you are fine the way you are' even when she's listening to Justin Biebier.
