It will be our first child. We haven't decided on domestic or international and one of my concerns are that if we adopted, say, a 5 year old from another country: They would not only be dealing with displacement, total culture shock, but also a language barrier. My concern is that the trauma of all this is far too much for a child. Does anyone have experience adopting in this situation or being adopted from another country at an older age?
I would like to hear about people's experiences before we decide if this is a viable option for us or if it's just too selfish to put a kid through that.",Adoption,Question about adopting older child (international),https://www.reddit.com/r/Adoption/comments/5aj77f/question_about_adopting_older_child_international/

Since we dont have children of our own and the last small child I helped raised was my baby brother (9 year difference) I am sadly out of practice.

Now considering the age bracket we are shooting for I was told we would need a crib, a child's bed, and a place to keep their clothing. Absolute basics. But I know you need more than this, especially for long term care which is what we would like to have.

So what do you all recommend we add to the list?
I plan to make the child a quilt and curtains since I have basic sewing skills and we are handing down my husbands teddy bear as a toy but other than that I'd love to hear about products for children in that age range that made for a more comfortable/efficient home life.

Funny thing is on the way home we got stuck on the highway cause of a crash. I have some PTSD over a major car crash I was in so that's a big trigger for me but honestly i was so exhausted from the trip it didn't panic me so much as irritate me.
And here is another strange thing, after we finally get past the crash (which was just a silly fender bender) the lanes next to us start going much faster then the lane we are in and my husband, who is driving, says, ""should we change lanes?"" and immediately i say 'No. Stay in this one"" cause my instincts said it was a bad idea. of course we are all used to our brain telling us every situation is a dangerous one, that's the whole problem. But this time was different. I could tell the drivers were inpatient and eager to get somewhere and it gave me a bad feeling. Not 20 minutes later bumper to bumper traffic again because that lane had a massive multi car pile up.
It was the first time in a long time my logical brain made a decision based on real information coming in and it wasn't just anxiety brain calling the shots. i could actually tell the difference and i think that was a bigger breakthrough than getting to the beach.",bigsteps,Went to the beach (an hour away),https://www.reddit.com/r/bigsteps/comments/4jr889/went_to_the_beach_an_hour_away/

 I thought the PTSD was pretty much gone for the most part because i can be a passenger with little anxiety now but i was fooling myself about that. every time someone pulled up to a stop sign i felt their car hitting me. It's visceral and jarring. I hate it. i was near tears and my husband said we should go back home. i refused to do so. I knew that if i gave up when I was feeling so badly i wouldn't try it again. So i insisted that i keep driving until my anxiety went down. and it did.
I live in a very upper upper middle class neighborhood (we are not upper middle class, we just got crazy lucky to find a duplex in the neighborhood we can afford) and there are some terrible drivers around me cause apparently rich people are in a hurry all the time and think they always have the right of way.
