Hello r/relationships, so I have a rather annoying situation that I really don’t want to and don’t feel like I should have to deal with. I’m pretty sure I’m not being the “bad guy” here and I’m not sure how to go about handling this. This is dumb and complicated so just prepare yourselves, and I hate explaining relationship issues like this because this feels like high school drama to me. But I feel like I need advice so here we gooooooo


I’m gonna just organize this based on the people this involves, also I’m using psuedo-names from Parks n Rec.


So basically I have a few friends up here, and I personally separate them into 2 different groups. There is Ron, Ann, and Leslie and then there is Tammy and April.


I’m on good terms with all these people and I am really close to Leslie, and by extension I’m close to her friend Ann. The three of us have a good dynamic and Leslie and Ann both like hanging out with smaller groups of people (as do I).


I met Ron this year through Tammy. Ron and I really clicked and get along super well. He and I hang out fairly often. So I decided to introduce Ron to Ann and Leslie and they all hit it off really well, Ann is even interested in Ron as a romantic partner and they are going on a date next week.


I became friends with Tammy this year and while I think she has some nice qualities I have really, really, begun to wanna distance myself from her, which I’ll get into shortly.


April on the other hand has been my friend for a while now, I personally feel she and I use to be much closer because we were both very lonely and wanted someone to be close to. But I feel I branched out more and met more people I got along with while she still labels me her best friend.  While I don’t feel as close to her as I used to I still very much value her friendship but probably not to the degree she does. 


So basically I enjoy hanging out with just Ann, Leslie, and Ron. I get along with them really well and I feel the most emotionally comfortable around them, while I like April and Tammy I find that they have certain qualities that drive me nuts. April can be a little elitist and judgemental sometimes, and she is extremely sarcastic which is normally fine in other people but with her I can NEVER tell if she’s being serious or not. Like one time she said “Great we have to walk into town” but it’s AT MOST 1000 feet downhill and then back uphill, and I genuinely couldn’t tell if she was actually complaining. Also, one time when we were going to all hang out, April woke up late and took 30 minutes to get ready and to get to lunch so Ann, Leslie, and a friend of Leslie had to wait in the restaurant for a half hour for the rest of us get there.


Tammy on the other hand does stuff that drives me up a wall. Sometimes when I try to talk about things that are bothering me (past issues with friends, ex’s, parents, etc) she will try to ‘one up’ me. Saying things like “Oh my year was much worse”, “My summer was so hard” after I was talking about my last summer, or “You have no idea how bad it could’ve been”. Like people take things differently and don’t try to compare our different experiences and make your’s sound worse, we all experience emotions differently. She also gets mad if I don’t want to go to a party or go out with her, I don’t really like big parties where everyone is completely trashed and I know like 3 people and I don’t like dancing because I look like a finless fish flopping on land. Like I said, I like hanging out with small groups of people. And she will say things like “you suck”, “you’re a piece of shit”, or “you’re an asshole” if I don’t go. And I think she thinks it’s joking but it gets really fucking old really quickly. And I’ll admit it’s partly my fault for not asking her to stop doing it. She also mothers all of her guy friends, telling them that they’re cooking wrong or that she tells them what to buy to keep them healthy and this really annoys Ron. And she said something that I found really selfish a little while ago, she was annoyed because Ron wasn’t texting her and I said “Well he likes to have his alone time, he’s very introverted” and she told me “Yeah but I NEED him more than that”. People don’t exist to please you, I just find her to be really entitled and it aggravates the hell out of me. And this just bothers me a lot but she also claims to have a good “read” on boys which is total horseshit because she can’t tell that I and Ron find her aggravating.


So I have been hanging out with Leslie, Ann, and Ron for most of my freetime. And just them, we haven’t invited April or Tammy because of the above reasons. But also because Leslie and Ann have both expressed dislike for both April and Tammy. They don’t hate them, talk behind their backs/gossip, or wish them ill-will, they just don’t like them very much and don’t see either of them as friends, which I think is fine, sometimes people’s personalities don’t mix well together and they won’t be friends. Ron also expressed to me that despite that he’s known Tammy for a long time (before me), she really gets on his nerves with the mothering and overbearing and neediness. So we have been hanging out without them and kind of keeping it on the down low, which looking back is pretty shitty of me but I didn’t feel like dealing with potential fallout and making Leslie and Ann uncomfortable by inviting Tammy along (Tammy would DEFINITELY ask to tag along if she found out I was going to Ron’s with them).


So I decided to invite Leslie, Ann, and Ron on a trip back to my hometown. I decided to not invite or tell April or Tammy I was inviting Leslie, Ann, and Ron because A) Ann and Leslie and Ron have expressed disdain for one or both of them, B) I don’t think there will be enough room in my house for everyone to stay without doubling up which I’m sure NO ONE is interested in. C) I don’t feel like having that many people at my home and I don’t think my family will want many more people


I know I should’ve told them but what happened is exactly what I expected, Tammy found out and got mad at me and said “Oh thanks for inviting me!” And I blew it off and said “I can have separate friend groups”. This argument/fight was happening while I was waiting to be let into my friend Leslie’s apartment, while Tammy and April were outside waiting for a delivery and talking. Tammy told April and April got frustrated with me as well. So basically Tammy yelled and berated me while I was trapped waiting for Leslie to open the door for me. Tammy said things like “You can’t have separate friend groups because I introduced you to Ron first, so he’s my friend and we have a friend group already that you are a part of”, like…. What? That makes no sense to me. Basically saying I’m entitled to her because she introduced me to him, which really isn’t true because I met him through a mutual friend that she also happens to know. I was about to snap at her because my flight or fight behavior was kicking in but April let me into the building before I snapped. BUT I had to “apologize” to April before she would let me in for not inviting her along the trip too. Which looking back on annoys the hell out of me because she knew I was uncomfortable being yelled at while I was waiting. And I don’t feel like I should have to apologize. I was forced into an apology when I was cornered because Leslie was busy and wasn’t at her phone and couldn’t answer the door. I just feel like it’s really shitty and manipulative to corner me while I have to wait outside to be let into my friends building.


I think part of the issue here is that April thinks she’s friends with Ann and Leslie because they’re really polite and amicable to her but just don’t get along with her. While I’m kind of realizing Tammy is an annoying fuck.


But I’m not sure if I’m being too harsh? Like I probably shouldn't have tried to keep it a secret but I was scared of receiving this kind of reaction. Like I understand them being hurt, but like I’m driving April and Tammy back to my home next weekend (April is from the same hometown) and Tammy has a friend she wants to see for Fourth of July near where my home is. I understand them being offended but like….. I don’t know what to tell them. Because like…. Ann, Ron, and Leslie all don’t like them! Like I’m driving them home one weekend and my other friends another weekend. And yes, I invited one group to stay at my house and not the other I acknowledge that but I just don’t feel like having April and Tammy stay with me.


So now April wants to talk in person, and I don’t know how to tell her “Ann and Leslie don’t like you, sorry.” I also don't really want to say how Ann and Leslie feel about April because they want to remain amicable with her. And April says that she and Tammy feel left out, but like I went out to dinner with them and hang out with them if I’m free so I can’t exactly feel too bad for them.

I have decided that the easy choice is usually not the way to go. By this I mean I feel a lot of easy choices are purely out of fear or anger, at least in my life. An example being that I almost dropped out of college last year because I was so lonely and scared, but I toughed through it and I'm truly glad I did. I have come out better, stronger, and most DEFINITELY smarter because I stayed in school and I have met some wonderful people because I stayed in school.

But I'm in a bit of a conundrum right now and honestly I'm waiting for older or more experienced redditors to roll their eyes and remember how they went through something similar, or just how absurd my situation might be to them. And I’m willing to hear anything, criticism, advice, sagely thoughts, angry rants on how I am a dumb young man (I am), etc.

So I was very lonely my first semester of my freshmen year at college but I met some people in the second semester. I made good friends with them and I even developed a crush on one of them, (let’s call her M) she sadly did not feel the same way but I eventually got over it. Over the summer we developed a really nice rapport with each other and I really appreciated our friendship, and I was fine with that. She became my best friend.

I had a very OK summer as my parents can be just a tad bit grating and I missed school badly, so I was very excited to go back and enjoy my time with my new friends. Sadly, this was not meant to be, as some fucking deity out there decided that two of the people in our friend-group had to have a tiff with each other that was handled EXTRAORDINARILY NOT well by either party. Eventually sides developed (which was complete horseshit, it's two 19 year olds arguing, not the fucking Syrian Civil War, people can be neutral) and people were forced to choose sides. I decided to stick with the people I liked better because, well, I did have sort of a crush still on M and I did truly like the one side significantly better.

So that kind of put a damper on the beginning of my first semester as I missed the whole group but eventually I got over it. Our friends were split but I was managing and I still had a close rapport with my crush/friend and I had (and still have) some really great friends outside this group of people. But my relationship with M was getting a little more confusing to me.

In the beginning of the year M told me she wanted to be single and not date someone because she felt it was best (she was talking in regards to another person and not myself). I took this still as a hint that I should give up hopes of dating her, which I was a little saddened by but there are plenty of fish in the sea for lack of a better phrase. But later on as the semester progressed she started to get a little flirty, like touching me all the time and playing tickle types of games with me. I took this at first as simple playing between friends and dismissed it. But at one point we were messing around with each other and she grabbed me around the waist and laid her head against my chest and fell asleep, while I rubbed her back which she clearly seemed to enjoy. Now I don't know about you fine people, but to me, that is pretty damn intimate. So I started to question myself about  asking her out again but opted against it and decided to wait a little while longer.

And thank god I waited a little while longer, because shortly after this little 'cuddle' session M and I were going for a walk together and we were talking about her appearance.. And eventually she starts fishing for compliments, I of course respond truthfully and honestly telling her she's very attractive in my eyes and all that jazz. She eventually says 'I'm only a 7/10' and I respond with 'I think you're more like an 8/10', because that is how I feel.

Well shit hit the fan after that comment because she called me 'internally misogynistic' and told me she wanted to be alone. I was a little miffed at that and walked away to my room and couldn't sleep for a couple hours. I texted her the next day asking if she wanted to get lunch and she told me she did not want to eat with me that day.

So I wait a couple of days and eventually texted her asking if we can talk. We meet, in person because fuck texting honestly, and I tell her she hurt my feelings.

WELLLLLLL shit hit the fan on that too because she was clearly unhappy at the thought that I had my own feelings hurt. We got into an argument and she called me a 'asshole, misogynistic, fuck boy' and well, yeah that basically turned into, to put it lightly, 'verbal altercation'. It ended with her asking 'Are we not friends anymore' and I responded with 'I think we should definitely take a break for a while'. After this our mutual friends have stopped talking to me, which I expected they do like her better (and one of our mutual friends has a crush on M as well so I can't really get upset with that person honestly)

Ok now that you read that giant wall of text (unless you're like me and are probably going to skip to the tl;dr) and highschool-like bullshit  my conundrum is that, despite how I have been treated (which I feel is unfairly but please feel free to disagree) I still want to be friends. I miss all the stupid little things we would do together, like say 'what' by only mouthing it as quietly as possible. I miss the stupid fucking cuddling even if it was or wasn't only a tease. I miss the long talks late at night. I miss doing homework late at night together. But I think deep down I know that this easy choice of me saying sorry, and us maybe getting back together as friends, is ultimately unhealthy. And I know a part of me still wants to date her because I think she is really attractive and I honestly have a bit of an obsessive streak when it comes to crushes. It's stupid because I do feel like I have broken up with someone, but I actually haven't because we weren't even 'dating'. The hard choice is going out and meeting new people, which I don't think I'm particularly bad at, I'm just really impatient and miss the CLOSE personal connections I had. And it sucks being sad like this.

Like I really do debate on adding her back on snapchat and Facebook. Just so we have at least some kind of connection, but I feel if I do that I start going down a slippery slope where I feel I should be friends with them again. And ultimately I think that is really, really, really bad.

So that is my conundrum, feel free to comment with whatever you think. 

tl;dr-Had a close group of friends, one of them I had a mild crush on. She got mad because I called her a 8/10 in terms of attractiveness and now the group of friends doesn't want anything to do with me.
