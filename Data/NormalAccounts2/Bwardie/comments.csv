Many of the offense heroes have low health but can dish out loads of damage. Your job as an offense hero is to get into the enemy team's back line and kill off their supports/builders/snipers. If you are looking for a starting offensive hero, I would recommend soldier 76. Use your sprint to get behind the other team and use helix rockets for massive damage.
