Well fear not for I have composed an average guide for the average player on how to choose your offense hero and what to do as an offense hero.

**An Offense Hero's Job**

To be honest, I'd rather call offense heroes flanking heroes because calling them ""offense"" heroes suggests that their job is to run straight into their team and do as much damage as possible. **THAT IS INCORRECT, OFFENSE HEROES HAVE THE SMALLEST HEALTH POOL IN THE GAME.** The offense hero's job is to run around the opposing team and get into their backline to eliminate key heroes (Lucio,  Mercy, Widow) so your team can make a push. It's better to repeatedly do a little bit of damage and escape with your life as an offensive hero rather than get one kill then die and have to run all the way back to combat. Notice how all of the offense heroes have some type of mobility within their kits that are better for different kinds of maps. With that we transition into my next point. 

**Map Choice**

Oh where do I begin. Many offense heroes rely on specific map choices to do their job. These heroes include: Reaper, Pharah, Genji, Soldier 76, and Tracer. Each hero excels based on the terrain of the map. Here is a list of each map I feel each offense hero excels on. I'm mainly going to discuss escort maps in this section.

* **Pharah** : Pharah can excel on open maps such as Watchpoint: Gibraltar and the early parts of Route 66 due to its general spacious terrain. However, there tend to be a lot of Widowmakers on Route 66 so be wary when ulting. Another great map is Dorado, you can hop over a majority of the buildings and completely destroy the enemy's backline. Pharah is also a good pick on King's Row specifically for breaking through tough defenses with her ultimate. 

* **Reaper** : Reaper is amazing on king's row, the amount of vertically advantageous spots are ridiculous and that is just perfect for the wispy fellow. Furthermore, the tight streets and small rooms allow for reaper to pull off insane ultimates and completely negate a push. Reaper seems decent on Volskaya Industries but that's only from personal experience.

* **Genji** : Genji is great on any map he can use his wall climb on. This and his swift strike are what allow him to excel as a great flanking hero. Maps that he can use his wall climb on include: Hanamura, King's Row, and Route 66. I include Route 66 on this list specifically for the sheer amount of Widowmakers that I have seen on Route 66 and Genji's ability to take care of them.

* **Soldier 76** : Soldier 76 does a great job on Route 66 on both defense and offense. He can use the high ground to his advantage and completely dominate other offense heroes/junkrats. The final part of Route 66 is great because of the spacious indoor area because it provides multiple levels of verticality for 76 to abuse. These reasons also make him a good choice for the first part of Numbani.

* **Tracer** : I don't play Tracer that often so this might be incorrect so feel free to correct me on any mistakes I might make. The only times I play Tracer are for last minute swaps on *defense* in order to distract the enemy team while my team sets up. **IN MY OPINION** Tracer performs a lot better on defense than she does on offense. By the way, Tracer is godly on control maps so I recommend playing her on those.

Thats all I have so feel free to tell me how I can improve my guide and if there is anything I forgot to include.
