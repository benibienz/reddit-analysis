3,"&gt; Some advice. It's a lot easier to start tough then lighten up. It's almost impossible to start soft then try to be strict later. They won't take you seriously. 

This. X100

Also, be a man of your word. When I first started there was so much random little shit that I never learned in training. A simple, ""I'm not for sure, but I'll find out and let you know."" will go a **long** way, assuming you actually find out and follow up. I won't disrupt my rounds or what I'm doing but I always took notes down of offender location and question and I'd let them know the answer on my next go around.

Most knew the answer already, they were just trying to trick a newb into allowing something they usually are not allowed. Some even told me they were just trying to fuck with me or get away with something by hoping I'd say ""Yeah, that's fine"" to one of their questions that I wasn't for sure on. If you do not know, ALWAYS ask and find out. You'd rather ask your supervisor a 'dumb question' than explain to that same supervisor why you made a dumb decision. :)

And honestly? I find enforcing policy to be no issue without being an asshole. I very rarely raise my voice, and when I do, they know it's for a reason. I won't raise my tone of voice to match theirs. I speak slowly and calmly to make their level lower to mine. Just basic active listening skills goes a long way too. These people are locked up and many have lost touch on a lot of things we all still have a grasp on, but they're still people. I don't put anyone below me unless they give me reason to.... Shit, I've been known to eat chow food with the lower levels.

""How do you eat that shit?"" they'll ask. ""Well, it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me."" is usually my response. (Basically means I forgot my lunch that day but it wins a lot of respect)

You'll be tested everyday. Just remain calm and cool. Don't let people get under your skin. I usually let my pen do the talking, I ain't no stranger to paperwork and they know it.",2016-11-19 00:12:56+00:00,da6dukx,2.0,t1_da66l9s,10592.0,ProtectAndServe
4,"ACA is a joke, but luckily one that only happens once every 3 years. We recently had a big ACA audit and spent a good month running special crews inside the facility to deep clean EVERYTHING from the fuckin' boiler room that only maintenance usually sees to even some of the tunnels under the facility to the more common areas. It was insane.

We passed their audit with a great score, only being docked for a couple minor things that are impossible to fix due to our facility's design/layout.


With that said, I am attempting to become a Certified Corrections Officer though the ACA only because it looks good on resumes and will give me a leg up on future promotions because we have no CCO's working at my facility and the test is purely policy related stuff. So, shit supervisory staff should know.

26,"&gt; These are the people who've done nothing to educate themselves or develop skills in an increasingly complex world

Lets touch base on this. Care to elaborate?

What would America *be* if *everyone* was college educated? Who would run farms, work on machinery in factories, drive semi trucks to deliver products, serve food in our restaurants, put out a forest fire, build a house, mop a floor, swap out a transmission on a car when it rolls into the shop, groom a dog, drive a school bus, pick up your container of trash, etc?

There will always be a very large ""uneducated"" population because they're absolutely needed. Whatever 'increasing complexity"" enters this world there will still always, ALWAYS be a need for just regular folks in a wide array of industries who are not college educated.

I personally feel much better off for it. I've got a great job working for my State, zero student debt, zero personal debt. I own 20 acres of land next to one of my favorite national parks in the country, looking to buy land close to home in 2017. I'm happy with being 'uneducated' because I'm not just surviving, I'm thriving.

Disfranchising the 'uneducated' voters is what put Trump into office. The democrats, next time, should spend more effort in rural areas and instead of trying to change the way of life of these people or tell them 'tough titties', they should reach out to them. Clinton failed to do that, so even though she won the popular vote stemming from mostly metropolitan areas, Trump still beat her by 62 Electoral Votes from the areas that matter.",2016-11-13 15:29:24+00:00,d9yhjnm,6.0,t1_d9yh4bg,808.0,politics

* Medical Emergency type drills where officers must 'successfully' perform CPR on one of those CPR dummies... but in a day room on a unit or in an area where they're under pressure and being observed. If they forget the steps or can't perform it properly while being watched by others, including possibly inmates, then how will they be able to perform it in a real life scenario?

* Hostage situations. I actually recently went through some intense hostage negotiation training and it was amazing, but have yet been activated for a drill or a real situation. Every facility should train on this...

* Multiple emergency drills. One unit has a fire alarm, but master control says a severe thunderstorm warning has just been issued for the county. Now what? At my facility all staff and inmates report to the **basement** for severe weather. Not fun times. What to do if fire alarm is ringing on a unit during this time, can't return there... (quite a possible scenario)

* Fire alarms in uncommon areas. We recently did these in our mail room, which is in it's own fence within the fence. Because the mail room staff were already outside the 'burning building' no one was inside the building to open the gate. Same with master control. If it's on fire no gates are getting open quickly or easily... There are procedures in place but most officers don't know them. (Same with medical emergencies in these areas)

* Unlocked or unsecured areas that should be secured. My first week as officer a sergeant decided to test me by unlocking a gate in the yard leading to a work area.

I'm comfortable doing some repairs, in fact I'm replacing the sway bar links and bushings this weekend which seems simple enough but I'm not confident enough to work on my braking system. This truck has been a learning experience for me for sure.

The reason I assumed calipers is because when the front is jacked up the wheel seemed partially seized. I assumed it was a siezed caliper which would also explain why there would be heat generated on that side more than the other.

I'll probably just have the entire braking system redone. The day I bought the truck, literally, a brake line snapped and I 'crashed' into a field going about 15Mph as I was moving the truck around to the back of my house. The lines have been replaced but it appears the rest of the system isn't as great as it should be and now that I'm rocking tires/rims larger than the stock ones I've noticed it's not as responsive to braking as it was previously.",2016-11-12 05:17:12+00:00,d9wvcli,2.0,t1_d9wtulk,2956.0,fordranger
59,"I won't say his name, but let's just call him ""Tom"".

Tom is an officer at the prison I work at.

I sometimes work in Master Control, which is basically the nerves of the prison. All radio traffic, offender and staff movement is controlled and managed by Master Control. No one comes in, leaves, enters or exits the facility or a unit without Master Control allowing it. It can be a very stressful job, especially during M-F count time where we have many people out of their normal areas on an 'out count'. It's like air traffic control but for a prison.

""Tom"" is usually assigned a duty in which he is away from most people. They'll put him the yard. They'll make him motor patrol. They'll put him in entry/exit. He is annoying, dyslexic, and unable to pick up on any social queues. Tom likes to enter Master Control and talk about nonsensible shit like some great chili recipe or how his truck needs a new transmission when I am busy on the radio, answering the phone, opening/closing gates and doing shit on the computer.

He doesn't pick up on *any* social queues. Most people are capable of realizing when someone is busy, and they fuck off, or stand their quietly until they can ask a work related question, then leave. Tom? No, he just rambles on.

112,"I replaced the stock and rusted 14"" rims with black Pro Comp 15"" rims. Since the tires that came with the truck when I bought it were not in the best of shape (and because I bought larger rims) I obviously had to replace those too... I thought about going up to 31's since that is the maximum size the truck could handle without a lift kit *but* opted to go from 205/75R15's to 235/75R15's so as to not really fuck with truck performance too much. She drives and handles well and still stands a few inches taller than previously. (Comparison in tire sizes: https://i.sli.mg/c7Qsqp.png )

When I bought the truck for $1,000 it had maybe 20% of it's hood that was chipped away and just primer. Above the windshield had some rust spots that were showing. Tailgate had a rust hole in the bottom corner. Driver side had some paint missing/chipped away. Tires were worn, rims rusted. Front and rear bumpers both were faded and rusted. The front variant was sagging on one side having been broke. The grill was cracked and faded.

Most of what I did cost very little and only took a bit of elbow grease. Duplicolor Perfect Match spray paint matches the vehicle's OEM white color very well. Rustoleum's bumper and trim paint is also a wonderful product to use as well. On the inside all i've done is throw out the stock stereo and put in a cheap media player (MP3, Aux, AM/FM, USB, SD-Card) which works great since I always stream Pandora from my phone when driving.

The only things I want to do now are:

* Replace stock headlights and taillights with some aftermarket ones. Undecided on what to use. Suggestions welcome.

* Replace the hydraulic bed cover with a camper shell.

* Install some amber and white LED strobes in the front grill and rear window for storm chasing. (Possible small LED light bar in the front variant space, 20"" or so max)

* Buy new mirrors. The 06 mirror mod looks great.

209,"&gt; If you can afford a dedicated set of winter tires that is obviously your best bet.

Eh. I probably can but I don't really want to. Since the tires I have now are just cheap Wal-Mart tires (came with the truck when I purchased it) I don't really want to buy *two* new sets of tires... one for the winter and one for all other seasons. Winters here range from mild (light dustings of snow) to more 'wintery' which may consist of a single storm dumping 6 or so inches of snow. Roads are pretty well maintained that I travel on, though.

I'm confused about rims and their measurements. Like, ""5x7""/5x114.3mm, -6mm offset"" vs ""15x8""/5x114.3mm, -19mm offset"". Stuff like that.

Rarely do we get a LOT of snow, by everyone's standards, that measures beyond the above.

But of course ice and shit is always a concern. Luckily the roads I travel are well maintained in the winter time.

This prevented the resin from running down my body and activating the agent on, uh, more sensitive parts.

The first thing I do when I get on the unit is check the TVs in the common area. They like to 'black out' the TV where they turn the brightness all the way down so it appears to be off. They'll place tape or marker over the LED light to indicate if it's on or off and will be listening to Music Choice TV stations, which are prohibited. When I catch it I unplug the TV, take the remotes or take the radio box (can only watch TV with the radio box to transmit audio from the TV to their headsets) for an hour or two.

I always tell them that I know it's a stupid rule, but it's a rule, and it'll be enforced. I've tried to get the TV's simply put on a parental block and the facility won't do it. At the same time, if a sergeant or liutenant walk the unit and see the TV 'blacked out' they chew you out for not catching it and will take the TV away for a lot longer than I will when I catch it...

Long story short, inmates get pissed and complain about it but the state won't actually block the prohibited music channels.

In Texas it was illegal to open carry handguns, but legal to open carry rifles and long guns. As such, Texans open carried rifles in protest until the law changed.

644,"1.) Different strokes for different folks. Open Carry allows individuals to wear size appropriate and form fitting clothing while also being more comfortably able to carry a properly sized pistol. When I conceal carry I conceal a single stack Kahr CM9, and while I'm accurate enough with it... it's still a snappy little pistol with hot Hornady loads in it. When I OC, it may be a Glock 19 which handles much better and I can shoot much more accurately. In a self-defense situation, god forbid one ever arose, I'd rather be carrying the gun that I feel more comfortable shooting. (I also often CC the G19, it's not too big. When I OC I often OC a fullsized 3rd gen S&amp;W 4566)

2.) I agree on this. I don't mind OC one bit but when I do it, which isn't very often, I at least dress in a presentable manner. No one seems to notice or care about the sight of a gun around here, but I do work in a sect of law enforcement and sort of 'look like a cop' so perhaps that's why no one bats an eye.

3.) I think you're confusing 'open carry' which is mainly referred to when carrying pistols and 'open carry texas' which was a group that got popular and a lot of negative press when they organized events where they openly carried, legally, long rifles because Texas had (and still does) have shitty gun laws when compared to most of America and open carry of pistols was illegal there.

I believe the only reason some people associate open carrying rifles as 'open carry' is because the open carry Texas protests. It was illegal for them to open carry pistols so a lot of images emerged from these groups and protests where they (legally) open carried excessive long guns like AR15's, shotguns and AK47's, etc in public places.

Though because the inmate who killed her was already serving a life term, it's safe to assume he was a high level inmate that should have been behind a heavy metal door with no free movement. He should not have been able to have direct access to any staff and usually they can only fit their arms through the slot in the door where you'd slide a tray of food.

Some fuckers will still fight partially blind and refuse to comply as they don't feel the pain.

Though for normal people, myself included, OC changes your thought process *quick*.

LOL, no. I'm a Correctional Officer, and even in low level (level one and two) facilities you do not have people serving time for 'just getting caught with a joint'.

We do have non violent drug offenders, that is true, but most of it is hard drugs and they go to prison only after receiving many chances to turn their lives around and failing.

The prison I work at has a ton of programs for drug offenders that rehabilitates and reprograms them so they can get out, stay clean, and hopefully become functioning and contributing members of society again.

If you go to prison for pot, then you're basically an idiot who got caught time and time again or with amounts much larger than personal quantities. I used to smoke, many officers used to or have smoked pot in the past, and trust me when I say the only known offenders in our prison who is in there for anything marijuana related either had marijuana charges added to a ton of other shit (grand theft auto, possession of marijuana, possession of handgun without license, etc, etc) or people who were dealing in large quantities (who have also been in/out of the system in the past, who were not first time offenders).

Getting caught with a joint is hardly worth most officer's time to fill out paperwork, let alone something to land you a ten year stint in prison.",2016-07-10 04:45:45+00:00,d56c6ll,3.0,t1_d563hor,16043.0,politics

810,"&gt; Like, would any of the stuff that the COs do in the show ever actually fly at your prison? What are your opinions on the show?

Helll no. We've got active Internal Affairs that investigate staff and offenders within the prison as well. The biggest problem we have, as with any prison, is trafficking of contraband. We've had officers cuffed and escorted out of the facility and picked up by police and there isn't much tolerance for unprofessional behavior in general. Most of us abide by the rule of acting like you would if admin staff were standing right next to you. 

We had a new officer lose her cool a couple weeks ago and she started getting frustrated and cussing, pretty sure she got reprimanded for that.

The TV show is entertainment, but lot of inaccuracies. Lot of PREA violations shown in the show. Where I work, the guards can't just sit on their ass. We *have* to do rounds around the pod/building/unit and hit checkpoints along the way which digitally log proof that we're actively moving around and watching the offender population.


I think in the last 10 years there has been one death on grounds, and it was seriously related to a heart condition. An older woman went into cardiac arrest or had a heart attack or something. This was before my time. We've never had a suicide, but a week or two ago I overheard someone upset on the phone say something like, ""If that's true, I'll fucking kill myself"" so I reported that so we could pull them asside and talk to them and let them know who to talk to if they need to talk to someone and they went to medical for an evaluation. They were fine. I think a year ago we had a credible suicide threat so they were under 24/7 in-person watch in a room. After about 36 hours we got them transferred to a different facility in the state that was better equipped to deal with those at-risk for such things. I've never personally seen a fight, either. I think the last time an officer had to deploy their pepper spray was a good 4 or 5 years ago to break up a fight in a hallway.

Honestly? It's pretty lax and controlled where I am. It's low level and everyone there will be going home eventually in the forseeable future.

812,"Correctional Officer here:

SHU = Secured Housing Unit. Typically offenders who are an active violent threat is placed here though it may be a temporary housing situation depending on a severe policy violation.

Max = Higher level offenders, usually people doing many many years. They don't place offenders in low level minimum security prisons if they're doing 30 years. Generally to qualify to become a level one, two or three offender you have to have your earliest possible release date be within a certain amount of years. It varies state by state and I have no interest in getting into the specifics for my states as I don't want the state I work in known.

Psych = A mental health ward within the prison. We don't have one in our facility but those who require it will be transfered somewhere else. Those who express suicidal tendencies or even joke about suicide will go speak to medical for a psych evaluation and they get back with us. We've never had a suicide in our prison. 

It seems Litchfield is a larger prison complex but the show itself focuses on the minimum security side. The 'SHU' would be 'down the hill', still on prison grounds but likely a separate facility in operation and likely a different building in general. This would also be where they house maximum security inmates.

It amazes me that, uh, the woman who said she killed four guys in a year as her 'record' was in minimum security, but that would only be if she killed them while young and served most her sentence in max. I work in minimum security and the murderers we have there all did 10-30 years in max before qualifying to finish the rest of their time in our facility which is much more lax and has much more freedom for them.

We need a border wall. It will only cost $10 billion, that's nothing. Illegal immigrants cost the state of California $25B/yr alone.

And placing a temporary ban on immigration from countries known to have large radical Muslim population isn't a bad idea either.

* Attack ads for previously supporting maximum wages.

* Attack ads for having zero respect that his son refuses to call him father.

All election season long, Trump supporters have been given so much shit about being 'violent', when there have been countless numbers of instances where Trump supporters are the *victims* of violence. 

It's bizarre.

Go wear a Trump hat and walk around a liberal college campus. Wear a Trump hat over at DePaul University. See how tolerant the left is. Put a Trump sign in your front yard when you live in a blue area. See how quickly until it's vandalized or stolen.

This is why every capable man and woman who support Trump should, where legal (Most parts of California, New York, New Jersey, Chicago, etc need not apply) conceal or open carry. I'm serious.

The same type of unhinged individual who would approach a complete stranger and verbally and physically assault them for supporting a different candidate than themselves is the same type of individual who may accidentally or purposely kill you. There are many cases of people having been killed from a punch to the face/head that knocked them out. Having  your head bounce off concrete or hitting a curb is no fucking joke.

Everyone should protect yourself from the violent left. Their inability to co-exist with other Americans with alternate views than their own and their ability to quickly transform from a reasonable person minding their own business to someone who is yelling and throwing punches at a stranger over a political belief is what makes them dangerous.",2016-05-29 23:26:35+00:00,d3ojr33,1.0,t3_4lmhlw,4935.0,The_Donald

I wasn't going to do this for you, but it only took about a minute of my time. A minute that you were too lazy to use to look up facts.

Reals &gt; Feels.


If I lived in that neighborhood, one that had recently been shaken by a lot of recent home invasions and robberies, I'd certainly report suspicious behavior just like Zimmerman did as well. It's part of being a good neighbor and watching out for each other.

For more fun reading, you should see: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/trayvon-martin-texts-reference-guns-fighting-pot-article-1.1353832 and read some transcripts from his text messages that discuss his wanting to buy a gun (illegally), drug use and of course recreational violence that the boy wonder participated in. You can of course find many other sources for this information as well. (Google results are full of Zimmerman selling the gun like the article in this thread so you have to find older articles before the past month or so from when the case was relevant)

It's unfortunate a life was lost, but at the rate he was going he'd have been shot at a later date due to his misguided actions or would have taken a life with his own hands due to his violent nature and path he was going down. A better outcome would be that he survived the single shot to the chest and was incarcerated, hopefully that'd have scared him enough to get his life on track but that sort of stuff is like a badge of honor to thugs so it may have only escalated his actions in the future to be even worse. It's hard telling, and hard to rehabilitate people when they have a loose moral compass.

It amazes me that even with the overwhelming evidence that Martin was such a piece of work that this was national, heck even global news.

When arriving at the airport check-in counter, the gun must already be in a locked hard case and unloaded. Ammo can usually be stored in the same box, and you will check it with security or airport police and the gun in it's locked box will go inside your checked baggage.

After landing at your destination, in a lot of places, you're free to get your bag from baggage claim like you would any other bag, go to the bathroom, and strap on your concealed carry (or open carry) gun.

This means I can pick someone up from the airport and carry, go inside and eat lunch with them in any area that is not beyond the TSA security checkpoints, etc. Also means I can legally carry in most places after I land and get my rental car or catch a cab to the hotel or whatever.

Schools differ everywhere. I can carry on school grounds now but I can't go inside, which is fine, I don't have kids anyway so no need for me to go inside a school.

It's an old house, built in the 1870's in the historic district of a small downtown area. It's small, about 620 sq/ft but it's large enough for me. I've got a decent sized small yard, partially fenced in. Quiet neighbors.

Water bill is about $25-$30/mo, electric averages about $120 or so.

I love this small little town. The people are friendly, the crime rate is low (normal small town drug stuff), and living in a nice little historic home is pretty neat. Down sides is that the house is crooked as hell from being as old as it is, but that's to be expected, and due to the historic nature of the home and it being in the historic district there is some limitations as to what you can do to improve the home and it's efficiency. But hey, $275/mo.

1218,"It's easier to turn a NO into a yes than it is to turn a YES into a no.

After I tested out and was on my own, I realized there was so much shit I didn't get taught. When someone asked me something I'd never give them a definite yes/no answer but instead tell them I'd go find out. If you tell them you'll find out, you better go find out. They'll respect you more.

Also, you can be ""Friendly"" in some cases but you can not be friends. I can crack a joke here and there when appropriate because I know my population but I see too many officers who have inmates know too much about them. It's what happens when you see the same people day in and day out for years but there is no reason for anyone to chit chat and be 'friends' with inmates. If they know you like fishing, and you let them know that, they have all the time in the world to read every book they can about fishing to talk to you about it so they can trick you into letting your guard down around them. Don't do it.

And of course, fair firm and consistent. I'll admit that I wasn't as firm as I was when I started and it took me a few months to find my voice and get comfortable walking into a unit where I'm the only officer to 100+ inmates but it gets easier with time. Now I can walk in and they know I won't put up with their bullshit but they also don't give me too much guff because I'm also not an asshole. I've found my own style of getting shit done and it's effective and respectful to the inmates but they know I don't mind doing paperwork so I'll write them up all day if they want to play games. I just want a clean, quiet and safe unit.

Don't talk bad about other officers. Don't talk shit about other shifts. Inmates hear that and tell other officers.

Don't be afraid to call for backup if needed. If you're dealing with a confrontation and notice you've got 10 people around you, call for fucking backup even if things seem to be getting de-escalated... As someone who is QRT sometimes I'd rather show up to a scene where I don't have to do anything that show up to something horrid.

Uh... lets see. Oh yeah, don't traffic. It blows my mind how many people get arrested for trafficing when they work in the prison system. Don't do it, it's not worth it. Sometimes I feel like I'm not cool because no one has ever asked me to, lol. But I guess that's because they know that shit wouldn't fly with me. If you act all buddy buddy, afraid to say no, and give them personal info about you they're going to try to get you to traffic for them. Don't fucking do it unless you want to go to prison yourself.

EDIT: Also, don't leave your equipment laying around... We have like two officers who during shift changes always leaves the damned bed boards laying in the day room. They leave the unit to meet their relief (which they're not supposed to do) and never have the clipboard with the bed board / location and all other info (medical lists, notes, whatever) on it in the fucking common area where inmates can get access to it. They don't need to know the first and last names and bed locations of people on that unit or know who is being held in for medical and stuff. It's a big breach of privacy and it irks me when the sergeants don't do shit about it.

I saw someone leave their keys on the desk before... we have key keepers but to unlock a lock you have to take them off the key keeper. Someone was at a center post that is open to the population and unlocked a filiing cabinet with their keys, then left the keys on the desk (where anyone could get them) and walked away about 10 feet to this small enclosure (that should have been locked, but was unlocked) that has a copy machine and printer and stuff. Long story short those keys went missing for about ten minutes before I gave them back to the officer who was freaking the fuck out looking for them.

If keys go missing, no one is going home until they're found and the place is going on lock down. NEVER LOSE YOUR KEYS. I turn my key-keeper backwards so the flap is facing outside and the clip is inside my pocket. This keeps my keys from jingling when I walk (*stealth mode activated*) and if they were to fall off the key keeper they should fall into my pocket and not on the floor, gravel or grass where I may not immediately notice it.

If you ever have to read and screen outbound mail, read every fucking word. People like to skim these letters or get uncomfortable when someone is talking to their lover about all the dirty things they want to do to them but the outgoing mail is really the best place to learn what is really going on inside the prison and to learn about the offenders you deal with daily. They also insert cries of help in letters knowing they're screened because they'll say stuff to friends and family that they don't want to be seen telling an officer. Things about violence, drugs, PREA violations, etc. Take that shit serious. They're in your care and protection. Don't half ass reading outbound mail because you don't want to read letters because there is some serious shit in those. You don't want someone to kill themselves only to find out they sent a letter home the night you were assigned a post that screened outbound mail and they told their Mom or Dad or girlfriend or boyfriend or whoever that they stopped taking their meds and have been hurting themselves and just want the pain to stop....

Listen in on conversations when you walk around. Don't get lost in your own thoughts, thinking about what you need to buy from the store when you leave work. Listen to what is being said around you. 

Don't get discouraged when you have administration that doesn't seem to have your best interest in mind. What they think is important and what you think is important is usually different. It's just how it is.",2016-05-20 04:13:21+00:00,d3cjpjx,1.0,t3_4jjfqw,348029.0,OnTheBlock

So, he leaks this to the press. They stop talking about his taxes, they get all giddy thinking, 'Surely this will stump him now!', but they all fell into his trap. He planned this.

Now he can talk about his opponent's history from the same period, as he himself has already been ridiculed and attacked on this. It sets a precedent that talking about stuff from 20-30 years ago is indeed fair game.

&gt;""It’s funny, sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is, that people are lining up for food. That is a good thing! In other countries people don’t line up for food: the rich get the food and the poor starve to death."" -- Sanders in 1985

Kind of a fucked up view. How about a good country is one where we take care of our homeless population before illegal immigrants, and have jobs so that everyone can have their own food and not wait in lines for it?

&gt;""When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. You don't know what it's like to be poor."" -- Sanders, 2015

Oh okay. Only blacks live in a ghetto? Is that racist or not racist, according to the left? I thought wide sweeping generalizations about races were, uh, frowned upon.

&gt; “I have my own feelings about what causes cancer and the psychosomatic aspects of cancer. One wonders if the war did not claim another victim of another person who couldn’t deal with her tremendous grief and suffering that’s going on in her own country.” -- Sanders 1988

So grief and suffering is what causes cancer?

&gt;""The manner in which you bring up your daughter with regard to sexual attitudes may very well determine whether or not she will develope (sic) breast cancer, among other things."" -- Sanders in 1969

Yes, raise your daughter in a sexually correct manner! If you don't she may get breast cancer!

&gt; ""A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously."" --Sanders 1972

I don't even need to comment on that one. Let's just ask rape and sexual assault victims if they fantasize about being gang raped. Maybe Trump can do a two-fer, ask Sanders if Bill Clinton's sexual assualt victims were fantasizing about being gang banged when a man used his perceived political power to seduce women who'd otherwise not behave sexually.

1331,"Well, solar isn't so bad. The biggest issue with it is batteries storing the power. Batteries are expensive as fuck and don't last many years.

I don't have a big solar array at home, but it keeps 3X 300Ah sealed batteries powered and connects to a 1,000w pure sine wave inverter. Keeps some shit running when the lights go out.

The biggest benefit of going partially solar at home was the recognition that I was wasting a shit-ton of electricty in general before. Now I'm a lot more self-concious about what I leave on adn devices I buy and stuff.


Solar as a utility is okay but unless they have huge energy storage facilities then the power output basically stops when the sun goes down. I don't even know how large solar plants operate, if they feed into the grid only during daylight hours or feed into it at night via battery storage or what. Never looked into it.

Wind is shit in most parts of the US though.

GEO is usually contracted by the state from what I understand and you *may* get better pay and benefits working directly for a TDOC facility than a GEO ran one.

When I was in the academy we trained officers who was going to go work at a GEO ran facility in my state, even though everyone else in the academy was hired by our state's Department of Correction. The GEO officers were getting paid less than us starting off (A $4+/hr difference) and had used uniforms is all I recall. Benefits may have been the same or better either way, I really don't know. I did tour a GEO ran facility though and it was very well kept, if that means anything.

Your mileage may vary. I'm sure there are great reasons to work for GEO, they may have better benefits or pay in Texas than TDOC. They may work less hours or have a better schedule.

Open carry is not something I do daily, but I do do it occasionally depending on what I am wearing or where I am going. If you think someone who is going to rob a gas station is going to escalate a simple robbery into a murder just because he sees someone with a gun, then that's just silly. The more likely scenario is he'll wait for you to leave, or go to another gas station. A 'bad guy' isn't just going to shoot someone for having a gun because they walked into a bank and before they announce their intentions to rob it, sees someone in line with a gun. They'll likely sit back and wait, leave and return later, or go somewhere else.

OC is just worlds more comfortable, allows me to dress in appropriate sized clothing that fits my body type and still dress sharp. I hate concealing a gun when having a shirt tucked in.

If you ever return, hop the border and check out Boquillas, Mexico. If anything, do it just to say you did. I crossed the border in a small boat and caught a ride into town from the Rio Grande banks from a local for liek $5. You can walk for free or ride a burro into town for cheap. Good food, cold beer.

1519,"Just be fair, firm and consistent. I know it gets old hearing that, but it's repeated so often because it's solid advice.

In all honesty most facilities will put new, timid and non-seasoned females on posts that may not have as much direct contact with an all male population. It's the same for men working in female facilities. You'll be catcalled, I'm sure. They'll whistle at you and probably act just like you'd expect locked up guys to act. In any facility disrespecting an officer should not be tolerated, but with that said, pick your battles. Best thing to do with that is show that it doesn't impact you. Don't crack a smile, don't jokingly respond with any quip (Ha, yeah, you *wish* / Sorry, I don't date felons / Ha! You should see me when I'm not wearing this damn uniform )... just remain professional, fair, firm and consistent.

All that will likely stop for the most part once they realize you're serious, professional, fair, firm, and consistent. If you however allow that behavior, crack a smile or blush, etc then they've got a game going on and you're their amusement. It's the same with guys in all female facilities too.

Inmates are bored and lonely. Anytime the opposite sex is the officer (or well, same sex too for a handful) it's all a stupid game to them. Who can make her blush. Find out if he is married. I bet I can get that new officer to do this or that for/to me. Most think they're being smooth and coy about it but they're usually not... haha.



Other than that, you should be fine.


Learn to say no, often and sternly. Also realize that if you say you're going to check in and follow up on something that you better do it. Gotta win that respect. So much easier to turn a ""No"" into a ""I spoke to Sergeant so-and-so about what you asked and the answer is actually yes"" than telling 100 inmates that when you said they could watch TV without their headsets that the answer is actually ""No"", and that they have to go ahead and mute the TV. There are tons of stuff that you won't learn in training that are random and facility, dorm/unit or offender specific and this is stuff you'll only learn when asking questions. Remember: it's easier to turn a 'no' into a 'yes' than it is a 'yes' into a 'no'.",2016-04-13 14:54:22+00:00,d2177ek,1.0,t3_4ec75p,157834.0,OnTheBlock

Always more comfortable, can wear clothes that are appropriately sized instead of having to buy larger clothes, you can dress nicer and more professional.

No, I mean I have a yard and I don't plan on fencing the entire yard off. Instead I plan on fencing a section of the yard, meaning the yard will be partially fenced in.

I've read about some dog snatching around here.

I mostly work 8 hour shifts, though I sometimes come in 4 hours early. Very rarely would it be required to do a 16.

How often does a dog need walked around town if he has a yard to run around in? On my days off I often go for walks and short hikes so I'd love to have a trail companion, but this is not something I can do daily. Does everyone here walk their dog each and every day?

I'm not wanting to keep him in a kennel, on a leash or a short run while I am at work. My yard isn't huge but I'm putting in the time and money to install a fence with a dog in mind. It's probably about 3/4 of an acre all said and done. Once again, not huge, but certainly not super restrictive or confining. I'm currently land shopping right now anyhow and looking for some 10+ acre tracts out in the country to build a small cabin on, so the yard is only going to get bigger anyhow. :)

That doesn't sound all to unreasonable to me. Factor in the ability to bring my dog to work with me where he'll be able to interact with other dogs, get trained, groomed and taken care of while I work seems like another bonus as well. (Although that would be limited on my current shift, but I should be switching to days soon anyhow)

I also do have family living nearby that takes care of my cat when I go on vacation and leave town. It'd not be too much to ask of them to do the same in the rare event I have to work a 16hr shift, to come over and give the dog some attention and make sure he didn't empty his water bowl somehow or something.

I mean, in all honesty, what are our real options? Sanders is an admirable politician and is unique in many ways but he's not had the greatest record of passing laws and impacting any major change.

I do think he genuinely and passionately loves America though, this is evident in his earlier interviews.

Maybe you've seen these videos, maybe you have not. Trump has been saying the same thing for 25 years. These are big picture items that he has not changed his views on. I don't believe evolving on issues is a bad thing, I don't necessarily find it a big negative with other candidates depending on the circumstances as well.

I don't share all of his views 100% but I do share most of them.

What really sucks about growing up poor in a somewhat decent area is you don't realize your poor until you're old enough in grade school that you start to visit friends houses and stuff.

I still remember the first time I broke my mom's heart by asking her to drop me off at the stop sign and I'd walk the rest of the way to a friends house for a birthday party. I didn't want them to see me get out of our car because it was so trashy and I didn't want to be embarrassed. I had just recently become self-aware of our financial situation and realized that my childhood, growing up, and everything I was used to was not normal for the other kids in my school.

Though seeing my single mother work her ass off in a factory to make ends meet and raise a small litter of kids is what I give credit to my work ethic today. I saw her work hard and struggle to keep us all fed and taken care of. I don't know how she did it, but despite a lot of peers growing up and turning to degenerate lifestyles I somehow skipped past that.

But yes, as a white person, I know what it's like to be poor. I grew up poor. I moved out of my house on my 18th birthday because I didn't want to be a financial burden any longer than I needed to be, and I worked and worked and worked. I lived in a house in town with no AC, no heat. Cabinets were full of rice, ramen, noodles and canned food. I didn't have a car then. I walked from that house a good 2 miles everyday through an old path in the woods to get some shitty steak house where I washed dishes for minimum wage part time. I still was able to save money out of each check, until I had $800 that I spent on a 1996 Geo Tracker. Then I got a fulltime job closer to home, in a factory, and life got a little better.

That was a good ten years ago.

But man, being poor sucks. The only thing I can say positive about the experience is it taught me how to work hard and to be accountable for myself. We never got government assistance, I doubt my mom would even allow it. With about $24,000/YR she raised multiple children and kept the house (mostly) warm in the winter and cool in the summer. She made sure we never starved and all of the kids stayed away from drugs and crime... and trust me, there were drugs and crime around us.

I'm just ranting now but reflecting back on my childhood: Fuck Bernie Sanders. Being poor sucks, regardless of your color, but the solution isn't giving out more gibsmedats. Bring back jobs, create jobs, and encourage people to work hard and earn. Those with the high energy within them will actually get out and produce. Those who are lazy will fall back and fall behind under their own accord. I do not believe anyone 'deserves' anything.

But in all seriousness a wall isn't the end-all to illegal immigration. The fact that we'd be enforcing our existing immigration laws and that hopefully Border Patrol would be increased and have the ability to actually do their jobs would be significant.

Illegals cost American taxpayers way too much as-is. The cost of a wall and deportation of those who are not supposed to be here is less than the burden they place on us annually.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_illegal_immigrants_in_the_United_States#Economic_costs_of_illegal_immigrants

&gt; ""Local school districts are estimated to educate 1.8 million illegal children. At an average annual cost of $7,500 (averages vary by jurisdiction) per student, the cost of providing education to these children is about $11.2 billion.""[40] Other estimates of the costs to educate illegal children and US-born children of illegal immigrants reached $30 billion in 2009.[41]


.


&gt; Spending for public education of illegal immigrant children in K-12 public education in Minnesota for 2003-2004 was a total of $78.76 million to $118.14 million.[42] Alabama alone spend a quarter billion dollars a year on education and social services for illegal immigrants and their children.[43]
&gt; 
&gt; For the same time period, total spending in New Mexico at the state and local levels for illegal immigrant schoolchildren was about $67 million.[44]
&gt; 
&gt; Illegal immigrants who have attended school in California for three years are eligible for reduced in-state tuition for public colleges.[45]

Even if we are still a bit pessimistic, and assume a net worth of only $4.5 billion dollars as per the low estimate by Forbes where they only partially consider his real estate assets, and go by the scenario where he got a loan of $1 million dollars, he still managed to outperform the stock market more than 200-fold. [This is highly remarkable](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/09/03/donald_trump_s_wealth_he_isn_t_only_rich_because_of_his_dad.html) considering he made it in real estate, not banking, oil or technology.

That's still over $1.5 billion less than the low estimate given by Forbes of his net worth and that's the worst scenario you can come up with.

1944,"That's nothing. As Bernie wrote when he was 30, all women fantasize about being raped by three men.

So, when my wife came home... I had a surprise for her!

I got three large men, all from different ethnicities. I found them on Craigslist, nice guys. When my wife came home from a 12 hour shift at the hostpial, like most nights, she goes straight to the shower. This is where the surprise is!

All three men ran into our master bedroom bath and pulled her out of the shower. She was terrified and screaming, of course. But Bernie said this is what she wants.

I sat in a chair in the corner of our dark bedroom while I watch all three brutally have their way with her. This is certainly a gift she'll never forget!

After about two hours, the three men were done. They untied my wife and she stumbled to the phone to call the police. This is when I turned the light on to reveal myself sitting in the corner. I let her know I watched the entire thing, it was an early anniversary present!

She said she wants a divorce, I don't get it. I'm selling all of our stuff now so she can't take half. I'm sending both of our halves to Bernie's campaign.

I thought she'd be happy with this. :(

I guess the Syrian family I was going to let live in our finished basement (has it's own bathroom, small kitchenette, etc... like an apartment) will have to go elsewhere.

&gt;Citations please.

https://i.imgur.com/dLN2049.jpg (Source on image)

&gt;&gt;His personal history is comical.

&gt;Interesting please explain.

I did already: Sanders was a lazy slob in his younger years, didn't want to work, wrote rape fantasies while he was in his ***thirties***, which is creepy and didn't get a job and start collecting a paycheck until he was 40 years old. He was a lazy bum, which makes his socialist ideas understandable since he didn't want to work for a living but still wanted stuff without earning it.

&gt;&gt;When Trump was young he was making deals and working hard.

&gt;HAHHAHA, losing money maybe.

Losing money? How so? The guy is worth *billions*, with a **b**.



&gt;&gt;When Sanders was young he was barefooted, getting his electricty shut off for not paying bills, writing rape fantasy stories when he was in his 30s and trying to con women into sleeping with him by saying cervical cancer is caused by them not having enough orgasms.

&gt;Ah, yes that essay that's being trotted out for people with low reading comprehension to have knee-jerk reactions to. Pftphptf

Of course it'll be brought up. It's fucking weird and creepy. Oh, it's just satire? Tell that to the femi-nazis who take rape and rape related topics lightly. Try to sell that idea that it isn't creepy to anyone who isn't on reddit. Good luck.


&gt;&gt; Not to mention Sanders voting records: https://web.archive.org/web/20061018180921/http:/www.bernie.org/truth/crime.html

&gt;Most votes here sanders himself has said that he had conflicting feelings about. Most of those bad votes can be attributed to him voting for provisions added onto the bill that were actually worth it. Mandatory mins and protecting women against violence come to mind.

Nah, pandering to African Americans and young liberals comes to mind.

&gt;&gt;And of course, yes, the socialism. If you think most Americans, the ones who actually vote and don't sit online all day, will ever willingly vote for a socialist who will increase their taxes and decrease their take home pay then you're crazy. It just won't happen.

&gt;Show me polls within the last two months to support this, then sure. 

No need to go to the polls, just look at the caucus and primary results. He can't even get the majority of his party to agree with him, let alone the *country* as a whole.

&gt;&gt; Sanders is amazingly bad with money, as evident by his low self worth after four decades as a career politician.

&gt;That's a bold statement about someone with the net worth of $700,000 and an unknown financial history. Meanwhile, Trump is less wealth than when he inherited his father's fortune and has bankrupted most of the businesses he's run/taken over.

You do realize that Trump's father died in the 90's, right? By that time Trump was already worth a fortune and successful in business. ""Bankrupted most of the businesses he's run/taken over""... LOL. Do you lie because you're a genuinely dishonest, horrible person or do you lie because you're simply ignorant and misinformed? Trump filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on exactly 4 businesses. Four businesses out of hundreds. Hundreds of businesses have been succesful, leaving him with a 98%~ success rate in business. But yeah, hrrr drrr Trump bankrupty hrrr drrrrrrr daddy's money hrrr drr rich people bad rdhrhhhrrrr drrrr.



&gt;&gt;He has been in charge of the VA oversight and that'll be extremely easy to attack him for.

&gt;Sure attack him for passing the most comprehensive VA reform bill in recent history and getting rid of many issues that people saw the VA as a joke for. That'll work great.

What are the issues he's fixed with the VA? Why is the VA so heavily criticized to this day, and why has he been able to fix those issues after his years of oversight?

&gt;&gt;Trump will do and probably already has done more for American's veterans than Sanders has in his years of participation in the VA.

&gt;HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHHA

Good rebuttal. I guess all you can do is nervously laugh when you realize you're wrong.

&gt;&gt;Sanders has in his years of participation in the VA. ""B... but he tried! He couldn't get bills passed!"" ... Of course. Because he's not a good negotiator and wasn't able to get anything meaningful done.

Archive.org doesn't lie. These have been removed from Sander's site now that it's cool to hate police and be all for drug legalization, even though he voted strongly to increase police spending, increase drug control spending and more.

Trump would have a field day with him. And as far as substance goes, Sanders does the same thing. Drink everytime you hear him say ""Wall Street"", ""Billionaire class"", or ""the 1%""

Sanders is amazingly bad with money, as evident by his low self worth after four decades as a career politician.

He is also too friendly with communism which will be easy to attack him on, he had his honeymoon in the Soviet Union and attempted to meet Fidel Castro in Cuba. Many Americans would never vote for that.

From: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/476jze/trump_as_president_i_would_prosecute_clinton/d0aoofb

 
&gt; This is what Trump's platform is:
&gt; 
&gt; * No more nation building in the Middle East. He openly called the Iraq War a mistake even back when it wasn't cool to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; * He wants lower and middle class tax cuts. 
&gt; 
&gt; * He is focused on American jobs.
&gt; 
&gt; * He wants to reduce student loan debt. Is against the government charging interest on student loans: ""That's probably one of the only things the government shouldn't make money off – I think it's terrible that one of the only profit centers we have is student loans."" Openness to lowering student loan interest rates and making loan forgiveness programs.
&gt; 
&gt; * Wants to audit the Federal Reserve. 
&gt; 
&gt; * Doesn't have any special interests groups funding him unlike the other candidates. Has called for all candidates to return the money they're getting back to Super PACs and to remove special interest groups from our election process.
&gt; 
&gt; * Likes universal healthcare, is open to replacing America's broken system with something similar to Canada but better.
&gt; 
&gt; * Moderate on social issues (e.g. affirmative action, women's health, gay rights)
&gt; 
&gt; * Focus on broad-based American nationalism instead of narrow and divisive race and gender identity politics.
&gt; 
&gt; * Acknowledgement that political correctness is obnoxious.
&gt; 
&gt; * Desire to put America first in trade deals instead of pure Wall Street globalism that exploits third world workers abroad and destroys domestic jobs.
&gt; 
&gt; * Realist based foreign policy. (e.g. deal with Putin if it is in our national interest to do so, even if he isn't a nice guy).
&gt; 
&gt; * National pride. The man loves his country and thinks it is the best. Every country should have a leader like that.
&gt; 
&gt; * Diversity: he employed women in leadership roles before it was popular to do that. And he did it in the construction industry of all places. 
&gt; 
&gt; * He has absolutely nothing against legal immigration, he's encouraged it many times. His grandparents are immigrants, his wife is an immigrant, several of his closest business partners in New York are immigrants. He is against uncontrolled, illegal immigration.
&gt; 
&gt; * Hugely successful businessman, knows how to manage money, how to invest for the future and a fantastic negotiator. 
&gt; 
&gt; * Unlike other candidates, his economic plan actually makes sense. It would result in [""an 11 percent higher GDP, a 29 percent larger capital stock, 6.5 percent higher wages, and 5.3 million more full-time equivalent jobs"".](http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-s-tax-plan) 
&gt; 
&gt; * Take a look at this video of him [back in 1991 talking about how to utilize the upper class to re-invest in America or face higher taxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-HPlMHnORo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=86). Not only is he very knowledgable in economics and investment, but the tax structure he offers up back in 91' seems relevant even today to help alleviate some of the complaints we have about 1%'ers and wall street. 
&gt; 
&gt; * He's genuinely against TPP.
&gt; 
&gt; * Acknowledges the danger of allowing mass refugees from places governed by fundamentalist terrorist groups, even if such acknowledgment is not politically correct. 
&gt; 
&gt; He is a HIGH ENERGY individual who has literally created tens of thousands of jobs just with his own personal business, imagine what he could do by being a leader of America.


We need to spread real information and debunk myths and common liberal arguments whenever and wherever possible. We're seeing the tides turn and seeing more and more people support Trump which is great but we need to spread info everywhere as much as possible to dispel the notion that we're trolls, not serious about him or his platform, or just having fun for the sake of having fun. Let's spread the good word!

I also challenge each of you reading this to match my donation of $0.00. I had to sell plasma and jerk a dude off on the subway and not buy groceries this week but this $0.00 donation to the Trump campaign will be better used to make American great again. If everyone who reads this donates $0.00 then we can easily get Trump $000.00 or maybe even $0,000.00!!! Just think about it!

2032,"&gt;But also curious about keeping my debates short as they often go pretty long with my friends, any quick stumping talking points?

Well, they often like to call Trump a racist, sexist, xenophobe, pig, bla bla.

You could always remind them that Sanders is a career politican, who didn't get a job until he was 40, had his electicity shut off multiple times and lived in filth, is notoriously bad with money, wrote rape fantasy fiction stories and thought women got cervical cancer because they didn't have enough orgasms. He spent his entire youth talking about socialism because he was a lazy bum and wanted something for nothing. As a career politican he is worth comically little because he's so poor with money, and had even given campaign money to friends/family at one point which is a no no.

That is, if you want to attack the man himself. Attacking his ideals shouldn't be too hard, but best to lay it out in a way like this:

Ask the BernieBro or Bernista if they believe it's right that somoene like the 1% or a corporation gets things they didn't work for or earn. ""NO!"" they will say with glee. This is almost too easy. Ask them if they think corporations or rich people are greedy. ""Of course they are!"" they will shout. Then ask them why in the fuck they think *they* deserve things for 'free', paid for by others. Tell them that is the *ultimate* greed.",2016-02-22 04:10:11+00:00,d08x38f,1.0,t3_46z2u6,405.0,The_Donald

He looked around his neighborhood and saw people hustling to get things like Jordans, new rims, via illegal means. He saw Trump with his name on buildings. He said he wanted his name on a building one day too. Was very inspiring and put into context just why a lot of African Americans support Trump.

I understand the fear of a backdoor being installed in future phones and how people are worried about this impacting *their* privacy somehow, but I'd reckon that you'd first have to have your phone in the hands of the FBI before that would even become a possible situation you may face, which is a rare situation indeed.

2113,"&gt; MORELIA, Mexico— Pope Francis, visiting a state traumatized by drug-linked violence, urged young Mexicans to resist the lure of easy money through crime, and told church leaders to resist the temptation to give up the fight.
&gt; 
&gt; “Jesus would never ask us to be hitmen, he calls us to be his disciples—and friends,” the pope told tens of thousands of young people from the state of Michoacán gathered in a sports stadium.
&gt; 
&gt; Michoacán, which a few years ago a local bishop called a “failed state,” has long been one of the hotspots in Mexico’s drugs war, which has killed more than 130,000 people over the past decade and nearly 28,000 disappearances.
&gt; 
&gt; In recent years, the church has become more outspoken about the violence and suffered a backlash from cartels.
&gt; 
&gt; Across Mexico, more than a dozen priests have been killed or have disappeared over the past three years. Some have been random victims. But in other cases, they appear to have been targeted for undermining the control of criminal organizations in vulnerable communities, say church officials.
&gt; 
&gt; Earlier in the day, the pope told priests, nuns and seminarians to stand up against violence, corruption, drug trafficking and indifference to human suffering, calling resignation the devil’s tool.
&gt; 
&gt; The message is a consistent theme for a pope who worked the impoverished barrios of his native Buenos Aires as archbishop: Rather than accept earthly life as evil and await the next, Christians should work to redeem it now.
&gt; 
&gt; Pope Francis praised the example of Vasco de Quiroga, the state’s first bishop, who in the 16th century defended the rights of the indigenous Purépecha from the onslaught of the Spanish conquistadors. Bishop de Quiroga, who hoped to create a society founded on the utopian principles of St. Thomas More, founded hospitals and a school, and taught crafts to villagers that have endured.

&gt; 
&gt; “What temptation can come to us from places often dominated by violence, corruption, drug trafficking, disregard for human dignity, and indifference in the face of suffering and vulnerability?” the pope asked. “Faced with this reality, the devil can overcome us with one of his favorite weapons: resignation.”
&gt; 
&gt; Bishop de Quiroga had found the Purépechas a people “sold, humiliated, and homeless in marketplaces, picking up scraps of bread from the ground,” he said. But rather than resign himself to that cruel reality, he acted to change and better their world.

&gt; 
&gt; More than 450 years later, the reality of much of Michoacán is more dystopia than utopia. The state’s dominant criminal organization evolved into a sect-like group known as the Knights Templar, which was partly driven out in 2014 by vigilante groups formed by farmers, businessmen and others.
&gt; 
&gt; Many Catholics here hoped the pope’s visit would help convince some to turn away from crime.
&gt; 
&gt; “I hope this changes Mexico,” said Fernando Ledezma, a 58-year-old car-parts salesman. Mr. Ledezma’s hometown of Zamora, Michoacán, has recently suffered a big spike in violence between warring cartels.
&gt; 
&gt; The church here, under newly named Cardinal Alberto Suarez Inda, has recently taken a leading role in both comforting victims and condemning the violence.
&gt; 
&gt; Taking a cue from war-torn Colombia, some dioceses, especially in Michoacán and next-door Guerrero state, have developed programs to help people cope with the psychological trauma that accompanies the violent death or loss of a loved one.
&gt; 
&gt; On a recent night in the Michoacán town of Vista Hermosa, a priest listened as two dozen women took turns telling their stories of loss. María Guadalupe Arias recounted how six years ago, her husband, the mayor, was gunned down in front of her then 10-year old son.
&gt; ENLARGE
&gt; 
&gt; “Because he is a boy, I worry a lot about him,” she said. “When will this stop?”
&gt; 
&gt; The priest then asked all present to hold hands and pray. “What has God given you today?” he asked. Ms. Arias responded: “The gift of seeing the faces of my two children one more morning.”
&gt; 
&gt; As they have become more active, priests have increasingly become targeted as well. In Michoacán, a priest disappeared in 2012. Nothing is known of his fate. Another was kidnapped and killed last year.
&gt; 
&gt; In southwestern Guerrero state, where heroin is produced, three priests have been killed by suspected cartel hit men in the last two years. Not one of the cases has been solved.
&gt; 
&gt; “I feel the church is being persecuted,” said Bishop Ramón Castro of Cuernavaca, one of Mexico’s most violent cities. “In the Guerrero cases, it’s because they said the truth about drug dealers and delinquents.”
&gt; 
&gt; Last month, Bishop Castro spoke at the funeral of Gisela Mota, who was slain a day after taking office as mayor of a suburb of Cuernavaca. Officials blamed organized crime.
&gt; 
&gt; Afterward, Bishop Castro said intelligence agents told him his own life could be in danger. They offered him bodyguards, advised him not to sleep in the same place two nights in a row, and to change his travel routine. The bishop turned down the bodyguards, but didn’t sleep in the same bed for a week.
&gt; 
&gt; “The pope knows what is happening,” said Bishop Castro, who heads the Mexican Bishops Conference commission on justice and peace. “It is our mission that brings this danger.”
&gt; 
&gt; A spokesman for the Mexican government denied that the church was suffering persecution due to its pastoral work.

&gt; 
&gt; Some human rights activists criticize church leaders as doing too little. “The hierarchy is unengaged,” said Javier Sicilia, who created a victims’ movement after his son was killed in 2011. “These aren’t times for communiqués. The church should be out in the streets.”
&gt; 
&gt; Since 2006, when former President Felipe Calderón unleashed a war against the drug cartels, 40 priests have been killed, according to Omar Sotelo, a priest who has been tracking violence against the church in Mexico. About 80% of all cases are linked to organized crime, Father Sotelo estimates.

2125,"Women, minorities and sane people all love Trump. And why shouldn't they?

Let's stop talking out of our ass for a moment and listen to reason:

Trump has been great to women, both in his companies and will when he is our next President. He hired women into top level positions in an industry that was mostly men, before it was even a topic of discussion about women in the workplace. To have women operating in high ranking leadership rolls for large construction projects is more than noteworthy, it's amazing.

And minorities. Ah, yes, the minorities! They better vote democratic because we'll give them more free shit!

Here's a thought. A lot of minorities like Trump, if not for his alpha male attitude that gets shit done but because they also look up to him. Hell, he's been mentioned in rap songs SIXTY SEVEN TIMES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhGgHjwZxU

As you see, they've looked up to Trump for decades now as someone to aspire to be. When slinging dope and doing illegal things was their only source of income in their mostly democratic ran cities where legit jobs did not exist they saw a wealthy man, his name on buildings, yet someone who was still in touch with the common person.

With Trump vowing to end illegal immigration and bring back jobs to America (and create new jobs), minorities are the ones who will gain the most from this. The same with the war on drugs, Trump wants to eliminate this failed tactic. Who will benefit the most from the ending of the war on drugs?

In New Hampshire, everyone applauded Bernie Sanders for winning with every single demographic in the state. Guess what? Donald Trump did the exact same thing. He won with every single demographic. Young, old, male, female, black, white, etc.

So, yes. He'll win those votes. Not all of them of course, but you're extremely foolish if you think that Trump won't win votes in these groups.",2016-02-17 17:35:41+00:00,d03ekbc,6.0,t1_d03appz,5467.0,politics

He's been an inspiration for rappers and the African American community in general for decades as a symbol of sucess in business. While people might have to resort to doing illegal activity to pay their bills and put food on the table they saw a real estate mogul like Trump and looked up to him as someone to aspire to.

I can't wait to see just how well he does with the African American voters. Most of them should see that he is on their side with wanting to end the war on drugs, end illegal immigration and create new jobs and bring old jobs back to America.

Everyone says, ""If Trump just did this instead of this or that, then his money would be the same!"" ... which does not take into account any cost of living.

He did very well with the family business and grew it astonishingly. Yes, he had four *business* related, non-personal bankruptcies out of *hundreds* of successful business ventures. Big woop. His business track record is great.

Trump has been saying the same message for over 25 years, his opinions of our corrupt and easily bought politicans and the state of our country has been the same for decades. His message has not changed. This is evident in this interview conducted over 25 years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbzTyhIv2B8

Everyone throws around that he's ""sexist"", that he's ""racist"" or hates foreigners...

Also untrue.

Trump hired more woman than men in his businesses before it was even an issue or concern about woman in the workplace in an industry that generally was never seen as a woman's job (Construction industry) in many high ranking spots.

His grandparents were immigrants who came to America (legally), just like his wife who immigrated from Slovenia. His daughter and son in law are both Orthodox Jewish as well.

I'd say his business smarts, ability to get things done, and genuine love and passion for America is what qualifies him for president. His love for this country is evident in his decades old interviews where he expresses many concerns about America falling behind. I believe he'll have some of the best people working and leading in all areas that he himself is unfamiliar with and he'll take their counsel and advice.



    No more nation building.

    Lower and middle class tax cuts.

    Focus on American jobs.

    Openness to lowering student loan interest rates.

    Focus on broad-based American nationalism instead of narrow and divisive race and gender identity politics.

    Acknowledgement that political correctness is obnoxious.

    Desire to put America first in trade deals instead of pure Wall Street globalism that exploits third world workers abroad and destroys domestic jobs.

    Realist based foreign policy. (e.g. deal with Putin if it is in our national interest to do so -- even if he isn't a nice guy).

    National pride. The man loves his country and thinks it is the best. Every country should have a leader like that.

    Diversity: he employed women in leadership roles before it was popular to do that. And he did it in the construction industry of all places.

    Moderate on social issues (e.g. affirmative action, women's health, gay rights)

    Acknowledges the danger of allowing mass refugees from places governed by fundamentalist terrorist groups, even if such acknowledgment is not politically correct.

    Thinks things like marijuana legalization and medical marijuana should be up to the states.

    Anti-war in the aspect that he doesn't want needless or useless wars to be waged. He even said the cost of the Iraq war was more than enough to fix Americas failing roads, bridges and general infrastructure and he'd have rather seen it spent there instead of fighting over there. (But he does want to take out ISIS)

America is for everyone. And if you're not from America, you can still come here *legally*. There is a process to abide by, just like if I or you wanted to immigrate to another country. There is a legal way, and an illegal way.

Trump wants people to immigrate to America legally. His grand parents did. His wife did too. Donald Trump doesn't hate immigrants or non-Americans.

Thought we could just, y'know, go there and walk around.

Get there, there is a small line. Like six people in line in front of us.

""Oh""

Bouncer dude says they're filming and we could all go in shortly.

Few people walk out of the shop, I guess they were people who had prearranged times to attempt to pawn shit or something.

I had walked all the way there from Fremont street, I decide to wait it out.

About an hour goes by and a few people have left the store. I look behind me, a long ass line has formed. Luckily I showed up when I did.

We get let in, we walk around. Camera crew still inside. I didn't see any of the 'cast' besides Rick for a brief moment and that historian dude who always wears a red shirt. They had an area roped off where the historian dude was being filmed.

I just walked around and looked at items. Bought a few souvenirs for my parents who like the show, and left.

I'm in an episode in the background and slightly out of focus.

If people arrive who are not on the guest list, if they are in no way shape or form associated with the bride or groom or there as a guest of someone who is associated with the bride or groom... you can have them removed. Doesn't matter if the wedding reception is being held in a public park at a building that was open to the public the day before. It's a private event. If you're not there to support Trump and are there to only disrupt his event which is held for his supporters... bye bye. Off you go. The coat thing was clearly a joke as described in the original post three days ago.

Everyone criticizes Trump, it only makes him grow stronger. His ratings are insanely high. The media tries to paint him a bad light and it never works. Trump thrives on criticism and has spent virtually no money compared to all other candidates on his campaign as a result. He doesn't need to spend his money when the media absolutely loves talking about him.

He gets tons of free press, and the media gets tons of viewers and clicks on their websites from Trump related articles. I'll repeat what I said: The media loves the Trump. ",2016-01-10 16:04:13+00:00,cysxydx,3.0,t1_cysxlyq,724.0,politics

2530,"(i) In the early fall of 2001, Steven Hammond (Son) called the fire department, informing them that he was going to be performing a routine prescribed burn on their ranch. Later that day he started a prescribed fire on their private property. The fire went onto public land and burned 127 acres of grass. The Hammonds put the fire out themselves. There was no communication about the burn from the federal government to the Hammonds at that time. Prescribed fires are a common method that Native Americans and ranchers have used in the area to increase the health &amp; productivity of the land for many centuries.

(j) In 2006 a massive lightning storm started multiple fires that joined together inflaming the countryside. To prevent the fire from destroying their winter range and possibly their home, Steven Hammond (Son) started a backfire on their private property. The backfire was successful in putting out the lightning fires that had covered thousands of acres within a short period of time. The backfire saved much of the range and vegetation needed to feed the cattle through the winter. Steven’s mother, Susan Hammond said: “The backfire worked perfectly, it put out the fire, saved the range and possibly our home”.
 
 
(j1) The next day federal agents went to the Harney County Sheriff's office and filled a police report making accusation against Dwight and Steven Hammond for starting the backfire. A few days after the backfire a Range-Con from the Burns District BLM office asked Steven if he would meet him in town (Frenchglen) for coffee. Steven accepted. When leaving he was arrested by the Harney County Sheriff Dave Glerup and BLM Ranger Orr. Sheriff Glerup then ordered him to go to the ranch and bring back his father. Both Dwight and Steven were booked and on multiple Oregon State charges. The Harney County District Attorney reviewed the accusation, evidence and charges, and determined that the accusations against Dwight &amp; Steven Hammond did not warrant prosecution and dropped all the charges.
 
(k) In 2011, 5 years after the police report was taken, the U.S. Attorney Office accused Dwight and Steven Hammond of completely different charges, they accused them of being “Terrorist” under the Federal Antiterrorism Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. This act carries a minimum sentence of five years in prison and a maximum sentence of death. Dwight &amp; Steven’s mug shots were all over the news the next week posing them as “Arsonists”. Susan Hammond (Wife &amp; Mother) said: “I would walk down the street or go in a store, people I had known for years would take extreme measures to avoid me”",2016-01-03 13:46:40+00:00,cykc6gh,2.0,t1_cykappg,5887.0,news

Fact: This adult sized kid was pointing a very real looking replica pistol at people.

Fact: Police arrived on the scene to a 'man with a gun' emergency call with the mindset that they were looking for a man, with a real gun.

Fact: When police arrived on the scene, Tamir can be seen reaching towards his waistband where he had the gun when they arrived.

Fact: Officers reacted and responded as if it was a real gun with a real threat for their and the public's safety.

You'd think they'd have some sort of fitness requirement. I just pray that those who are visually and quite obviously out of shape who graduated the academy are more likely to be put in positions like mail room or behind posts.

2577,"Be honest.

Interview questions will consist of things like:

Do you want inmates to fear you or do you want them to like you? (Trick question, because they need to respect you enough to know what you expect from them, and be able to approach you when needed. They should neither 'fear' you or 'like' you, at least not think of you as a 'friend' but you can't be someone who they can't approach. Must be approachable but also not friendly... if that makes sense)

They'll ask for experiences in your life that make you feel that you are a good candidate for being a CO. So, if you have any experience at all that has you in a leadership position, go for that. For me, working previously in IT and having had to direct staff below me helped. In my IT career I also had to deal with, uh, what I guess I'd consider is ""damage control"" as far as handling upset clients. Not related to corrections but related to dealing with people in general. I'm sure you can find something that would meet this.

They'll ask standard stuff like how you work alone, how you work as a team, and which you prefer, etc, etc. When I first started, I was put on night shifts and I patrolled the yard for a month by myself... That was actually fun, I enjoy that. But our night shift crew gets along *great* and we all work together great inside too. (We go out to breakfast after work a couple times a week). You're going to want to answer that honestly but make it known you're capable at either. An example of working good on a team will probably be asked, so have an example prepared for that.

They'll also ask stuff like what you'd do if you saw a fellow CO or staff member in general doing something wrong, illegal, etc. How you'd handle confrontation between two inmates, etc.



Nothing to it but to do it!


Remember, your job as a CO is to ensure the safety and security of the offenders and fellow COs. Your job is not to punish them, their punishment is already being served by them being in prison. ( I mean, if they break the rules you write them up of course, you're there to enforce facility/state or federal policy within the prison )

Good luck.


EDIT: When they ask you if you have any questions: ASK! For me, I asked about things like the history of the facility since all the buildings were part of a larger state complex before it became a prison in the 80s. I asked about common offenses that resulted in the offenders being imprisoned there. I asked about what programs they offered inside for the offenders to partake in and stuff like recidivism rates and prisoner population. Express genuine interest in the facility, the grounds, it's history, the prisoner population and what is offered to them, etc. Ask them what a normal day may be like as a CO.

If they call you back you'll probably come in for a job shadow. If they don't specify a dress code for that, you can dress down a bit from the interview but still look business professional. Dress shoes. Slacks. Belt. Tucked in dress shirt or nice polo. Obviously nothing with giant logos or tennis shoes. During the job shadow you're going to walk through the facility, for me, I followed a sergeant around for about 4 or 5 hours. We walked through all the units, all the floors and talked to some staff. It was nice to see the inside for the first time and you get a better idea doing the shadowing of what to expect. If they call you for a shadow, it means they're interested in you. It's a chance for you to see if you're still interested in it after the facility tour. You'll probably fill out some paperwork at the end of it where you can write about your job shadowing experience and specify if you feel as if you still want the job... that is how it was for me, at least...


And obviously: Lighters, phones, tobacco, knives, guns, cash, etc stay outside in the vehicle... It's a prison. You'll also have to get used to going through security and being patted down every single day you walk into work. It's weird at first but then just becomes part of it.",2015-12-29 12:20:52+00:00,cyevtq6,1.0,t3_3yfu2a,140269.0,OnTheBlock

2598,"Seriously, just look at all the allegations against Bill Clinton:

&gt; In 1992 Gennifer Flowers stated that she had a relationship with Clinton that began in 1980.[11] Flowers at first denied that she had an affair with Clinton, but later changed her story.[12][13] After initially denying it, Clinton later admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers when put under oath during the Lewinsky investigation.[14]
&gt; 
&gt; In 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged Clinton groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave ""false information"" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[15] Willey dodged perjury charges after Kenneth Starr granted her immunity for her testimony.[15]
&gt; 
&gt; In 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged Clinton had raped her though she did not remember the exact date, which may have been 1978.[16] However, she did supply the name of the hotel (Camelot), and the reason she was visiting Little Rock (a nursing home seminar) when the incident had allegedly occurred. NBC News found that a nursing conference was held in the Camelot Hotel on April 25, 1978 (see main entry for Juanita Broaddrick). Broaddrick's only sworn testimony about Clinton was a previous denial of any harassment by Clinton.[17]
&gt; 
&gt; In 1998, in response to what she called false media claims that Clinton had raped her, Elizabeth Ward Gracen recanted a six-year-old denial and stated she had a one night stand with Clinton in 1982.[18] Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton.[18]
&gt; 
&gt; Dolly Kyle Browning began writing a ""semi-autobiographical novel"" about her alleged affair with Bill Clinton. In the publication process, Browning asserted that Clinton did everything in his power to prohibit and undermine publication. Browning sued Clinton for damages, but the US Court of Appeals denied her appeal.[19]
&gt; 
&gt; Sally Perdue, a former Miss Arkansas who said she had a four-month affair with him in 1983.
&gt; 
&gt; Connie Hamzy, a self-proclaimed rock-and-roll groupie, who said Mr. Clinton propositioned her in 1984 while she was sunbathing by a Little Rock hotel pool.
&gt; 
&gt; Bobbie Ann Williams, a one-time Little Rock prostitute who said Mr. Clinton fathered a child by her when he was the governor of Arkansas.
&gt; 
&gt; Eileen Wellstone, an English woman who said Mr. Clinton sexually assaulted her after she met him at a pub near Oxford University where Mr. Clinton was a student in 1969.
&gt; 
&gt; Sandra Allen James, a former Washington, D.C., political fund-raiser who said Mr. Clinton invited her to his hotel room during a 1991 campaign trip, pinned her against the wall and put his hand under her dress.
&gt; 
&gt; Christy Zercher, an airline flight attendant on Mr. Clinton’s 1992 campaign plane, who said Mr. Clinton exposed himself and grabbed her breasts.

&gt; Clinton's name appears more than 10 times on flight manifests for Jeffrey Epstein's private airliner: a Boeing 727. Epstein was convicted in 2008 in Florida for soliciting underage teenage prostitutes. Court documents show that Epstein used the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination in a deposition when directly asked, “Do you know former President Clinton personally?” Epstein made the plea in a 2010-2011 civil case between Epstein and Florida lawyer Brad Edwards, who sued Epstein on behalf of some of Epstein’s alleged victims.[21]

Thing is, when he is calm and clear headed if you would ask him what would happen to someone who kills someone else he'd tell you that they go to prison. Everyone knows that.

2608,"&gt; There are probably many in prison who aren't great candidates for college (you surely know better than I), but surely there are people there because they didn't have a lot of options in life, no?

Of course, and it's sad to see some finally realize their talents when they're locked up knowing that had they discovered these talents or utilized them on the outside for good that they could have been something great. Despite my job and the people I deal with, I'm not an asshole. They're human. My job isn't to punish them, being in prison is their punishment. I'm basically a glorified baby sitter of adults.

The one thing that struck me as most interesting/sad is just how many letters I screen (we read every single outgoing letter [besides legal mail]) that is addressed to family in other facilities. Mom and Dads. Brother and Sisters. Even when they write to someone outside of any facility, they ask questions about how ""so and so"" is doing and that ""so and so"" is locked up now. Most come from an environment where this is normal.

Regarding talents go: Some great artists, some fluently speak multiple languages (Not just English/Spanish), and you'd be surprised by the level of engineering they can do in prison with little to work with... Even though more often than not the stuff they conjure up isn't for ""good"", haha. It's still impressive and requires a unique train of thought that would be a good match for an engineering degree.

We do offer courses that give college credits though. I don't want to get too specific on what all we offer as I don't know how unique such programs are, I think it's relatively common though. We have many people who leave with their GED and some level of college accreditation through partnerships with accredited universities.

It's not appropriate at all for staff to follow up with offenders when they're released so we don't keep in contact but I do often wonder if those who we release follow the path we got them on while they were inside.

2611,"I'm not the person who made the comment you're responding to, but I'll respond to you. I work as a correctional officer in a prison, I love my job/

&gt; Your opinion of Sanders aside, what do you think of the current US prison situation.

It's sufficient. People don't just show up in prison because they got caught with a joint one time. You have to fuck up and throw away opportunities and be dumb enough to get caught... multiple times (usually) for drug offenses before you're sent to prison. 

&gt;Do you think it's just right?

Yes. Prison/jail has existed since, well, a long fuckin' time. It's been a part of every society as far as I know to isolate the bad. Nowadays prison is basically a nice gated community for those locked up there. Three meals a day, free room and board. They have more fuckin' cable TV channels than I do at home. You have access to a slew of programs for rehabilitation and education. At my prison we have sports leagues and art and performance programs. We have computer and business classes. It's very liberally ran.

&gt;Do you think we incarcerate too many and do nothing to rehabilitate?

I do not. Some people refuse to rehabilitate and some do not want to. It doesn't matter if the program is successful for most, it doesn't matter if you dry them out and force a rough detox and force them to be clean for the first time in years or decades. Some have internal and mental pain, memories or history that they just wish to drown out with drugs.

&gt;Do you think we soft on crime and criminals?

Yes, I do. We need harsher and stricter punishments as far as I am concerned, and better enforcement of the laws we actually have. People complain about gun violence but don't enforce the laws on the books and instead want more gun control. How about mandatory minimum sentencing for criminals who use a gun in an armed robbery? A mandatory sentence of 5+ years, even if it's there first offense. We have a revolving door system now where people come and go, in and out of the system over and over for crimes. They don't care. Make them fear the punishment of their crime.

2612,"Correctional Officer (""Prison Guard"") here. I agree that we should have a stronger focus on rehabilitation of drug addicts than simply locking them up, but it should be noted, at least in the state-ran facility I work at, we have a strong focus on rehabilitation for those who are there for drug offenses. I comment on the drug aspect since that is the thing most people seem to focus on when looking at America's incarcerated.

Here's the thing. You get caught with some pot, some coke, some heroin or meth. It's your first offense. Rarely are you going to go to *prison* for that. You're going to get anything from a slap on the wrist, a fine, community service, mandatory NA or other drug program/rehab or house arrest.

To be quite blunt: It's only after you fuck up multiple times and have been giving many chances to turn your life around that you get locked up. I really have no pitty or sympathy for those who are in prison for ""non violent drug crimes"" because almost all of them were given multiple chances before they go there.

When they do arrive, at least in our facility, we have programs for them. You're going to detox out. You're going to hate life. Then you get better. We have an insane amount of rehabilitation focused programs.

Most simply join them for the time cut. They tell you this. We read all their incoming and outgoing mail and they say they do it for the time cut. But you also read their letters stating how they're clean, for real, for the first time in years and that they feel better. They get healthier. They get better. Drugs still exist in prison, it's a constant uphill battle to fight and some decide to partake while others who are doing good in programs do not. We pull people out of bed many nights a week to do random drug screenings. Many pass.

Upon release, we still see a lot of people return. It's sad, but everyone comes from different backgrounds and do not respond the same as everyone else. Some will likely be institutionalized their entire lifes, and it's not ""sad"", it's just what it is. There is structure, chance and opportunity around every corner for those to learn, to grown, and to better themselves and it's not something you can force on them.

Of course, drug offenses make up just a fraction of those locked up and are mostly the low level / low time offenders. Still have murderers, rapists, arsonists and other violent criminals locked up too. Our incarceration rate is the highest in the world because we also have a lot of violent criminals in our country. 

And those locked up are not locked up ""disproportionately"" as he claims, but rather quite proportionate in regards to who is actually committing crimes.

&gt; ""In the long run, I think it's a lot cheaper to send a kid to the University of Illinois than to jail,"" Sanders said to applause.

Something tells me that someone who shoved a knife into the eye socket of their ex, stole their car, and then crashed it because they were ODing on heroin wouldn't be a good addition to University of Illinois and probably wouldn't complete even the first year...

&gt;""We will not accept candidates like Donald Trump, referring to Mexican people as criminals and rapists,"" Sanders said to boos from attendees, according to the pool report. ""We're going to end that. We're going to shut the door on racism. We are not going to let Trump or anyone else open that door.""

LOL. Even Bernie buys into ""Trump is a evil racist"" without understanding the context of what was said. He must get his news from reddit.

Usually can find an album somewhere though. Same goes for a lot of other bands and artists that don't have their entire discography available to be streamed digitally.

Streaming media just will never sound as good to most people. The goal with it is usually to deliver it to you as quickly as possible via smaller file sizes that reduces strain on the network resources it takes to deliver it to you. It's certainly convenient to have a wide array of songs at your finger tips that you can start, stop, skip, replay in any order or fashion you feel like but it comes at a (questionable) decrease in sound quality. For most that's fine and honestly I don't really care either, I still stream most the time but there is stuff that I bought on vinyl after having streamed it and listened to it a lot at my desk, mainly because I just really liked the artist and there were noises and sounds in the background I could hear that I couldn't before. It just sounded better in ways I can't really put into words. I don't even have what most vinyl enthusiasts would consider a 'good' setup... just a $120 turntable, $60 speakers and a $20 amp.

2732,"&gt; Lol. WHERE!?!?!!?

*&lt;sighs&gt;*

Well, if you haven't read the discussion let me do a quick recap so you don't have to read too much.

As a quick recap, legitimate reasons to OC:

* Comfort, ability to wear size appropriate clothing and not have to buy pants that are a size bigger to accommodate having a pistol tucked in your waistline. That alone is reason enough for *me*. I'm not that concerned with what people think of me or if they disagree with OC or think it's stupid or something only assholes do. I'd choose another profession if other people's opinions of me hurt my feelings. People are judged daily by their appearance, whether it be the way they dress, they way they carry themselves, the way they speak and act in public, their tattoos, and general appearance.

* Ability to carry a larger pistol than you can comfortably conceal. Not everyone wants to carry a large framed pistol IWB and not everyone is built for it or does not want to wear a shirt two sizes too big to cover the grip of their 1911 without printing, for example. It gives you the option to carry something that you are more comfortable with handling, which I'd prefer. I don't know anyone who shoots better and more accurately with a smaller pistol than they do a larger framed pistol of the same caliber. Besides, with larger pistols comes larger capacity. God forbid you're ever in a situation where it must be used, no one will ever wish they had *less* ammo. That goes for police and anyone else in general.

* ***Possible*** crime deterrent. No real evidence supports this just as no real evidence supports OC creates crime either, but logic dictates that someone who is simply going to rob a store isn't going to escalate that to attempted murder / murder just because he walks in and sees someone with a gun. He'll probably leave, return later, or go hit another store.

* Ability to inform the general public of what your state and local gun laws are when they express curiosity. Not everyone is afraid of guns, some are curious and will ask questions. This is where being a calm headed and reasonable individual is beneficial.

* Because it's legal, and no other reason *should* be required.

&gt; It's not a reason. It's legal to do a lot of things, like drink alcohol til you throwup, but that doesn't mean they're good ideas or that there are reasons to do them. 

No other reason *needs* to be given. Just because you disagree with it doesn't make it bad or wrong.

&gt; Never said it should be illegal. Maybe you're not smart enough to know that or you want to invent it to think I did.

&gt; The law does overrule my personal feelings. Good judgement should overrule yours, but you're fighting it kicking and screaming. 

I never said that you said it should be illegal, I'm glad we agree on that it should be legal. So you don't believe it should be illegal, but perhaps you can tell me what you believe it should be? Only for LEO? Only for wilderness hiking? Only on your private property or only at the range? It's clear you don't think people should be able to do it in public for any reason based on your response, however.

I agree about good judgement. Would I want to OC into some liberal college town's Whole Food store? Nah, not really. Some rural town's hardware store? Probably a more appropriate place for it.",2015-11-23 02:26:21+00:00,cx9p8fo,9.0,t1_cx9nu1z,2329.0,ProtectAndServe
2733,"Butthurt? Me? Nah.

I listed legitimate reasons to OC. I'll give you one major one though.

1.) Because it's legal in 45 states. Even if you don't like it, well, tough tits. Go write to your politicians, stop complaining, or find a profession where you're not offended at the rights of others.  :)

Newsflash: The Law of the land is greater than your personal feelings.

Other than that, people may choose to carry openly because they can or they want to for any number of reasons. It's not as rare in some parts of the country as it is in [insert city name here] and it's not alarming to some people as it is others.",2015-11-23 01:35:42+00:00,cx9neua,7.0,t1_cx9mp7t,1234.0,ProtectAndServe

2736,"&gt; Based on.....? Shitty IWB or fabric OC rigs are all capable of bending or snagging. 

Logic. While I agree that they are capable as well they're not *usually* being pressed up against you between your thigh and a belt. It has certainly happened in bad OC rigs too like this: http://i.imgur.com/Yhp8qNN.jpg from here http://www.itstactical.com/warcom/firearms/safety-warning-worn-leather-holsters-can-cause-accidental-discharges/ . That Galco rig had no reinforced leather and I'm pretty sure is one of those that sits between the belt and the outside of your pants, similar to an IWB rig but outside.

So you're right that it can happen on an OC rig as well. *I just feel* that it may more likely happen on CC rigs.

&gt; Don't tell me you just equated thugs and children.... You don't need to be a gun enthusiast to see this.

Those are two people who wouldn't immediately know about the release mechanism. You're giving too much credit to them if you think otherwise.

&gt;/facepalm_so_hard

&gt;Have you ever put your holster to the test? What happens if someone behinds you decides to grab your pistol in the SERPA with both hands and pull?

&gt;No, wait. You're too tacticool to ever have anyone behind you. 

Yes, which is why I made the claim that I did. I've tried to pull my Glock from my serpa before. I've tried with force. It stayed where it was supposed to.

Nothing 'tacticool' about me or my responses. I'm not into that shit. Unsure why you would think otherwise.

&gt; You list it as a reason to OC but then back off completely. Why don't I rub dead fish all over my body? That is a POSSIBLE deterrent. 

Yep. that would also be a ""possible"" deterrent too.

&gt; Oh wow. It's 2 to 2. 

I just provided the same number that was brought to me previously.

&gt; Let me point out something since I'm unsure if you can read: 

Please re-read my response. You will see me clearly state: **""And yes, I looked it up for you. States with open carry have lower rates of violent crime.* Though I am not certain it's because OF open carry*""**

There isn't going to be dead set evidence either way that OC or not OCing impacts crime in any real measurable amount. You said it did, I said it probably doesn't. You were unable to provide a source to claim it did, so I looked it up and provided two sources that say otherwise. I'm not saying OC is the *REASON* crime is lower in those states. But it doesn't take a genious to realize that someone about to rob a gas station isn't going to *usually* escalate a robbery to murder just because he sees someone carrying. The logical thing is to wait until the armed person leaves, or to go to another store. A robbery is still probably committed. At a later time, at a different location. I'm sure someone OCing has been shot before just as I'm sure someone OCing had their presence alone, like in the first link I presented, diverted a would be robbery or crime.

&gt; The article, as a whole, disagrees with you. Did you even read it?

I was just about to ask you the same thing. :)

&gt;  Awareness of an armed citizenry has been shown to lower crime. In 1982, Atlanta suburb Kennesaw required all households to have a gun. The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89 percent in Kennesaw, compared to the modest 10.4 percent drop in Georgia as a whole.
&gt; 
&gt; Ten years later the residential burglary rate in Kennesaw was still 72 percent lower than when the ordinance was passed.

That's just one case from one article. 

In the big bold quote you gave me, you purposely cut out the sentance above it.. that reads:

**Gaetz said, ""In the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower.""**

But as per my previous response and I already said it's not possible to tell if OC itself is the result of that or not. I don't think OC can be contributed to any increase or decrease in crime. I'm just posting sources that more side with me because you and no one else has posted anything to support that it ""increases"" crime in those states.

&gt; Obviously you didn't read it. It isn't common sense. It wasn't supported. That you find it encouraging is scary.

I like the part where you still don't provide any sources to back this up when I in fact provided some for you to read that did indeed support my claim.

&gt; So then holster doesn't matter. 

Of course it does. Holster matters as much as not being an idiot when it comes to re-holstering.

&gt; Which will fail first? Your pants, your belt, or the holster? Doesn't really matter because you'll be disarmed. 

Probably the holster in most situation and OC rigs.

&gt; Safariland 6360. If it's not in that, it's concealed. 

Thanks, I'll check it out. 99% of the time I'm concealing anyway but still think OC has it's place.

&gt; If you ever tried using that SERPA in a fight for your gun, you'd be dead. 

Hard to tell. Possibly so. Possibly not. If ""ifs"" and ""buts"" were candy and nuts we'd all have a Merry Christmas.

2739,"&gt; Here's the problem with how you frame this: reholstering is never for speed. 

I'm just saying a poor quality IWB holster has more ability to snag the trigger area when re-holstering than even a crappy OWB holster. You should be able to understand this and see this logic. Doesn't really matter if you're putting it in slow or in fast.

&gt; On a holster that advertises it's one retention device to the world. 

That's assuming that whoever is going to try to disarm you is already aware of that one retention device. Earlier you said children tried to take guns, so I doubt they know about it.  A police officer or other LE, gun enthusiast, sure. Typical child? Random thug? Probably not.

&gt; And some people open carry with SEPRA or only friction holsters.

&gt; Both groups are making terrible decision. 

Serpa seems fine. Friction holsters, I agree with you on though.


&gt;As you never gave anything to say it reduces or deters crime and you made that claim to kick off the conversation in the OP. Burden is on you, CO Hypocrite.

&gt;I can link stats that show crime hasn't gone down in OC states. Can you link the opposite that OC has deterred crime?

And yes, I looked it up for you. States with open carry have lower rates of violent crime. Though I am not certain it's because OF open carry, but because you were curious I looked it up for you: http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/oct/09/matt-gaetz/violent-crime-lower-states-open-carry/ 



&gt; **A 1985 Department of Justice survey of incarcerated felons reported that 57 percent of the felons polled agreed that ""criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.""**

&gt; **Researcher Gary Kleck found that 92 percent of criminal attacks are deterred when a gun is merely shown (or, rarely, a warning shot fired). By inference, this means that open carry would have the effect of deterring crime in the same way that a thief might choose another restaurant when he sees police eating at his intended target.**


Src: http://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-people-be-allowed-to-carry-guns-openly/open-carry-deters-crime

Thanks for encouraging me to look it up. It was just common sense to me before, that the sight of an armed citizen alone may deter crime, but I'm glad to see it's supported outside of just being a notion or a common hunch within my own mind.

&gt; And people can OC with baggy clothing, sweatshirts, jackets that get caught in the holster, too.

&gt; Amazing. 

Of course. The point is to not be an idiot when reholstering no matter what you choose which I think we can both agree on.

&gt; My favorite part though was when you ignored:

I'm not a Blackhawk™ SERPA®  sales rep and I'm not going to defend it's use to death. I like the product. You don't like the product. That's fine. You can hang me upside down from my feet and my gun won't fall out and you can pull up on my grip with hard force and it still won't come out. Yes, there is a button on the side that if pushed while also lifting the grip it will come out. That's exists by design. What sort of holster do you carry? I will look into it and perhaps I'll upgrade my own rig for the rare times I do OC and like the features of yours more.

2741,"&gt; I'm not a fan of open/concealed carry for non-LE. Some observations:

So you really think that non law enforcement should not be allowed to carry?

Unsure about your state but I know some states have some relatively lax requirements for firearm certification for law enforcement and it's not uncommon that police only fire their guns to re-qualify each year or each quarter so we'll have to agree to disagree that the *sometimes* meager training requirements *some* officers take make them safer than someone else. The training isn't usually extensive unless going to some sort of specialized unit, right? (And obviously after training they still somehow shoot themselves by mistake https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am-Qdx6vky0 , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUonA66btgI , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_7g3PcvD0 , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPiM2l4w6Qc , etc)  

I agree that I wish those who carried concealed or openly trained in some way. My state doesn't require it, but we don't seem to have any issues without the training requirement. Some states do requrie it. Unsure if there is any correlation in gun incidents between the states that do and do not require firearms training to carry but for those who don't somehow know the basics of gun ownership, taking some sort of course would be beneficial. Most everyone I know who carries was gun enthusiasts before hand but I hear and read about people who have never fired them before becoming interested. If they do not have a friend or family member who can take them to the range and shoot safely with for practice then a course for them would be great.

&gt;assault rifles

What is your definition of an assault rifle? Hopefully not something like an semi-automatic AR15. (For those unaware, ""AR"" does not stand for 'assault rifle' or 'automatic rifle' and instead ArmaLite rifle, referring to the company that first manufactured them)

&gt; Something a lot of gun owners forget because they're such a part of the culture (which is filled with other good law abiding people) is that guns scare and make a lot of other good law abiding people very nervous. A lot of people are made nervous by the police just because they are carrying a gun. 

&gt; Gun owners need to realize that the entire world is not as comfortable with weapons as they may be. 

I agree entirely.

Anytime I see someone dressed nice and OCing, which is rare really, I just assume they're an officer or detective of some sort. Thing I hate about CCing when dressed 'nice' is that I can never tuck my shirt in properly. I always have to blouse it too much and make it too bag to work properly, which looks tacky and unkempt and you still have that bulge on the side from where your belt is covering the IWB holster. The holster clips can be mostly hidden, which is nice, but I feel like I'm dressed sloppy if CCing in a tucked in dress shirt.

I mean, I still do it when I have to and maybe in the few rare instances I have to ""dress nice"" (shirt tucked in / business casual) I'd be better off with an ankle holster or something.

2752,"Well, in my understanding (and I could of course be incorrect) is that most the images of people OCing rifles are those from the Open Carry Texas group.

This is important to understand because until just this year, you could not Open Carry a handgun in Texas.

These men/women protested this by open carrying rifles everywhere, because under Texas law they could carry rifles in such a way.

I consider these people ""Freedom Trolls"", but hey, it worked. Texas joined the majority of America this year and became the 44th or 45th state to allow Open Carry of handguns. Unsure if it's put into practice yet, if not, it will soon.

Maybe I don't understand the shock factor of seeing a gun since I'm from a small town / rural area that isn't very liberal. If I see someone with a shirt tucked in, they don't look like a crackhead or gangbanger and they're OCing... I don't think anything about it other than, ""Hmm, I wonder what he's carrying.""

Only time I raise concern is when it's sloppy OC. Bad fabric belt or cheap with some heavy gun bouncing on someone's hip in a cheap nylon holster or something.

Saw a guy OCing the other week but it was IWB. Looks like he had a longer shirt on that day because it was cool in the morning and got to be 75~ or so in the evening and he had taken his outer layer off.

2756,"&gt; You're ignorant if you think that's true. I know two police officers that have had small children try and grab their weapon. 

Then you know two people who failed to teach their children the basics of gun safety. If you have guns and children in the house it's your responsibility to teach your kids about firearm safety. I think we can all agree on that.

&gt; Nope. Not similar. The only thing that holster protects from is gravity. 

And from someone just pulling up on it unless they also hit the button on the side while also pulling up on it.

&gt; Good for you having an opinion. How exactly is it safer? Because no reasons. 

What feels safer to you? Sliding/""dropping"" your loaded gun into your smooth OC rig like a Serpa Blackhawk holster where you don't have to push it in with any amount of force or pushing your weapon back into it's holster when you have an IWB rig or holster like a Galco Kingtuck which is pretty popular?

I always slowly and carefully reholster my Glock in my kingtuck because I want to make sure that in no way the kydex shell or leather backing touch any trigger part when re-holstering since everything is being pressed together between my hip and my belt. In an OC rig, you don't have that concern as much. With a properly made and well constructed IWB holsters like the ones I buy it's not a big concern but it's still a concern if you have shitty leather or kydex or both as part of the holster.

I think someone in general would be much less likely to accidentally shoot themselves if holstering/reholstering in an OC rig than a IWB rig is all.

The video you posted is in reference to the same link you posted I believe.

&gt; Or it attracts crime. So yeah. Scratch that off. 

So now OCing attracts crime as well? Statistically speaking, how much more likely is Wal-Mart to be robbed if someone decides to shop there while OCing? How much more likely will a couple be to be involved in a domestic dispute if they see someone OCing?

I just told them, ""It's good enough for you, it's good enough for me. It's not that bad."" (Though really I had forgotten my lunch that day... but they didn't need to know that. I've eaten the prison food a few times and it's really not that bad.) Most officers won't eat the food. I'm not above it.

Then last week I went and got my haircut there by the inmates which most staff won't do... even though it's available to us and free. I emailed the officers that run the program to let them know the inmate who cut my hair did a great job and I wanted to donate to the program they run since I can't give them 'tips' like you would elsewhere. They read my email to the class and the next day at work I had at least five people tell me 'thanks' because they were in that class and they read my message to them. About an hour later the person who actually cut my hair got like 2 feet from me and was like, ""Thanks man, it meant a lot to hear that I did a good job..."" I let it be known I'd be back every 4-6 weeks for a cut. :)

With that said, I've also had to resolve some conflict... I don't interupt them when they're venting and I don't raise my voice (usually). I speak directly and bluntly and in language they understand. I cuss a lot at work actually, which is nice that I am allowed to. I usually just let them get out what they want to say, ask if they wish to add anything else, and then speak my part. If they interrupt me I let them know I let them speak without me interrupting them and that I wish to be allowed to speak my part without interruption, noting they can speak when I am done. I've seen an officer have a shouting match across a common area with one inmate, yelling and cussing at each other. I was embarrassed for the officer that I was shadowing that day...

&gt;  Last tip, at no point should you get walked over.

This is my main concern. I've not had the issue yet but I've seen it to other people. They will ask someone to do something, they won't. They tell them to do it, they don't. Then they get written up. It's really silly but most don't care if they get written up because all they get hit with is extra work duty that they'll either never do or wait until an officer is on duty who will mark 4 hours off their extra work duty for doing 20 minutes of work. Sadly we don't have a lot of recourse available to us for those who simply disobey requests and orders... The idea though is that they'll do it for me when ***I*** ask... unsure how though.

I sit at a desk all day. No discomfort and I don't believe I print. I wear a CM9 at the 3 o'clock position or a bit more forward and it's fine.
