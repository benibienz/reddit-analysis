I decided today to buy a charging handle and new BCG for my 300BLK so I can stop this back and forth swapping.

I get home, and the new BCG will not sit flush into the chamber/feed ramp of my upper. ([See photos](https://sli.mg/a/dL2e8P))

The new BCG fits and functions fine in my 556 AR. And my Spikes BCG in my 556 AR works fine in my 300BLK build...

BUT, this new damned Anderson BCG will not work with the 300BLK build.

I originally thought it was somehow getting caught on the gas tube so I took the upper offer and removed the gas tube... I thought perhaps it was misaligned and getting caught. Nope. Seems the issue is at the feed ramps.

Any ideas?

And yes, I know that since it works in the 556 AR that I could just run it in that and run the other in the 300BLK but that's not what I want to do. I want to figure out why it's not working as intended in the 300BLK build.

See the photos to relieve any confusion about my poor descriptive skills. I've compared both BCGs side by side and can't seem to see any difference between the two.

It's 2WD, so as of right now the main thing I plan on doing is keeping some weight in the bed (Bags of salt and firewood) and getting some good traction mats in the back as well, just in case I get stuck.

But I'm looking at my tires today. They're not in awful shape, but they're far from new. I'm comfortable with them on dry pavement but that's it.

I'm wanting to replace my tires and the stock, rusted 14"" rims that are currently on it. I know nothing of tires and rims.

It's a 99 XLT standardcab, longbed. I think it'd be beneficial to have some new tires and larger/taller rims so I can increase the ride height. Right now the truck sits pretty low. Last winter I had some issues getting my car out of the street, even after digging and digging from where the snowplow burried it but that was mainly because it sat too low to the ground (stock height on a Focus). The truck sits a tad higher than that, but for a truck it's still pretty low. I'd like to increase it's ride height without having to buy a lift kit, so I'm thinking new tires and rims will do that.

Thoughts?

I was thinking of building a DIY solution. I was thinking of mounting an IR illuminator to a wooden post that also has a mount for a small solar panel.

Would something like a small 35Ah battery suffice in powering this? The light turns on/off automatically based on daylight. 

What size panel would be needed?

I've never seen the operations of a county jail before, so I am not certain if what is shown in 60 Days In is accurate for all county jails or not. As my flair states I'm a Correctional Officer but work in a State prison, not a jail, and the 60 Days In show (which all the inmates here love, btw... they watch prison shows everytime they're on...) sort of shocked me.

Is it normal for jails to have pods that does not have a CO in them at all times? Why is there never a CO assigned to each individual pod 24/7? Seems like a lot of the issues the participants talk about could simply be resolved by having someone situated in each pod whether it be at a podium/post or someone mobile who walks around like we do at the prison I work at. (Mobile officers that roam around and unit officers that stay on each unit)

Also, in the show, they only get one hour of rec a WEEK? Really? I though the standard was an hour a day. Even lifers who are in seg get an hour a day in a cage to throw a basketball at a hoop. Crazy to me that people in overcrowded jails are lucky to get an hour of rec a week.

Surprised they're allowed E-Cigs as well. Is that a privileged that inmates are allowed or are officers allowed to smoke e-cigs as well? I don't smoke and obviously tobacco products are banned in prison but it surprised me by just how care free they are when smoking. Do they sell e-cigs in commissary or something?

Pretty interesting show and it's certainly opened my eyes a bit. I never thought that the operations between a jail and a prison were all that different, I know they have different purposes, but I never imagined jails were like that.

So, how accurate is that show of average county jails?

The idea is to eventually build a little off-grid cabin down there, but that's still a ways away. I am however planning a trip down there soon so I can get some work done on the property, and I want to camp out to save money.

Any tips for camping in such a situation?

Since it's property I own I am thinking of building a quick/easy 'camp spot' on it that will include some wooden posts to make hanging a tarp shade a possibility, so I can have that hanging over my tent to keep me shaded. This will also mean I can camp without my rain-cover on which will allow me to catch some breeze. That seems like a high priority thing so I don't bake.

I can also bury a cooler in the ground just enough that I can open and close the lid without getting dirt inside. This should help insulate it and keep my ice, ice and keep cool things within it cool.

Firepit will be built at the 'camp spot' as well, of course. For cooking and what not.

Other than those things, what should I look into? I want to spend 5-7 days there, there is resources nearby where I can get supplies, water, and shower and stuff.

I want to camp out while I get my property boundaries properly marked, get my driveway 'installed' (renting a backhoe to clear a path to the center of the property and paying someone to grade the dirt path). Will put up a cattle gate at the entrance to the property with signage reminding that it's private property beyond that point and other misc work like removing some brush.

Would also like to setup a 50 gallon barrel for simple rain catchment and have water collected off a small surface with metal sheet roofing. No pumps and filters so would be something I'd have to obviously filter and boil before use, but it'd be handy to return to the property at a future date and have some stored water already there.

Would it make sense to build a quick/simple camp platform that is up and off the ground a bit? That way I can get some airflow beneath the tent, and in the event of a downpour I can avoid flooding?

* None in particular, rather just smaller dogs in general.

**What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?** 

* My cat is tired of my shit. But in all seriousness, looking for a companion animal that I can occasionally take on short hikes and toss a ball around with from time to time. Not wanting a very active hyper dog, but one that will humor me and fetch a ball when I want to throw one around and will walk with me (on a leash) in the woods on shorter hikes, and will chill with me on the couch and watch TV.

**What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?** Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?

* Grew up with dogs, basset hounds, dachsunds, norwegian elkhounds, etc. I've also been the primary caregiver but not the owner of a pit bull for a year. No real experience with puppies or elder dogs however.

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?** If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they? 

* Yes, a cat that is about 5 years old.

**Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?** 

* No to all of the above. 

**Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?** What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?

* N/A. I've got a yard that I am planning to partially fence in.

**Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?** How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?

* Just me, only me.

**How often do you have visitors to your home?**

* Rareish. I usually go other places due to convenience.

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?** 

* No real preference. Rescue sounds noble but having a dog from a breeder with predictable traits is also a big plus...

**Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?** 

* Puppy or young adult (Less than 1 year).

**What size dog are you looking for?** [Here is a size chart for your convenience.](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg)

*Small to medium.

**How much barking is too much barking?** 

* Barking for the sake of barking, is too much. Barking out of boredom is too much barking. Barking when excited, playing, or at as a sign or signal of something noteworthy is the right amount of barking.

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do?**

* As much as needed, but would prefer a short haired / non-shedding dog.

**How much shedding do you think you can handle?** Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.

* Not a lot of shedding. I've got a cat so I've learned to live with a lint roller and all but less shedding the better.

**Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?** 

* Yes to both. Some I'd do myself, others I'd pa to have done.

**How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?** 

* Everyone farts and slobbers. I'm a dude. I can live with it.

**How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?** 

* Unsure

**What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?** 

* House trained, even if it's going on potty pads. Other than that, the basic commands (Sit, stay, shake) should be the minimum of what I want to accomplish.

**Is there any behavior you can’t accommodate?** 

* Yapping.

**How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?** 

* Not very important to me, but it's something I'd certainly want my dog to be able to do. I'd like to be able to take him to a large park and let him run around/chase me if his behavior allows for it. My fear of course would always be a dog running off after another animal, running off into the woods or away for some reason.

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?** 

* The dog would stay in a fenced in yard area and would be able to exercise on his own when I am at work and asleep. Otherwise there would be occasional walks and hikes and the tossing of a ball or toy around.

**How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?** 

* Couple hours.

**Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?** 

* A combination of indoors and outdoors. I'd like for it to be able to sleep inside but I work nights and sleep during the day, so it'd be a likely mix up of the two.

**How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?** 

* Up to 16hrs a day on days I work, though more frequently 10~ hrs on days I work.

**If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?** 

* Yes, though I can also bring my dog to work with me under certain circumstances if I were able to get a change of working shifts.

**What is the general location in which you live?** You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume you’re somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).

* I decline to answer.

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?** Please indicate Celsius or Fahrenheit and the climate of places you may likely live in the future.

* Hot in the summer, freezing cold in the winter. Summer extremes can be over 100, winter extremes can be sub zero and below.

**On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?**

* 8~

**Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?** 

* Yes




Alright ladies and gents, I've been wanting a dog for quite some time now but wanted to wait until after winter so I can get my yard partially fenced in. The idea behind the fence is that I don't the idea of keeping a dog on a leash outside or even on a run. I want the dog to be able to chill in the sun light on my porch, and come inside when he wants to. If inside, and he needs to go outside, I can just open the door. Without the fence this would not be possible due to living downtown where he'd be able to get out into the road or run off.

I work six days a week, sometimes up to 16 hours a day. Those days are rare but can happen. Most days are 8 hours a day or 12 hours. I work nights so often leave for work around 5PM or 9PM depending on the day and return around 6 to 10AM, though as late as 2PM. That's why I want the dog to have freedom in the yard, and not be on a leash or a run.

I've been leaning towards some dachsund type mixes but I don't know. I can also adopt a pup from a litter of what appears to be some sort of collie mix. Real cute black and white long haired pups, but I have a feeling they won't be the best for me.

It's also possible I can bring my dog to work with me... I work at a prison that also has a unit of low level offenders that manage a no kill shelter. It's a great program, and they'll care for the dog while I work. They groom, play, train and give them attention and also allow them to interact with other dogs. Downside to this is I come in at night so they'd not have much time to care for him at night since they (the offenders) have lights out soon after I arrive on most evenings. If I do a shift change though, then they'd be up and about throughout my shift. This also has multiple downsides, like exposing my privacy since the dog would obviously have a collar with his name, my name, and number/address so unless I swap collars between bringing him to work and taking him home there are some concerns there.

I drive less than ten miles daily, so won't be running it hard, and the only things that'd be considered off-road would be at a nearby state park/forest that I sometimes hike and camp at that has poorly maintained gravel roads that go up and down hills and around turns. Lot of bumps and loose gravel, but even my Focus can make it... just with a bit of struggle, ha.

So while I know it may be what y'all would drive for real off roading, I'm just looking for something that can handle our more rural public terrain. Outside of the park there are still parts of the county that requires you to drive threw a creek as there is no bridge. It's usually dry and sometimes after a heavy rain may be 8"" deep or so. The rock you drive over though is flat limestone and easy to do in a normal car under normal conditions.

Vehicle has 100,000 miles and can be bought for $13,000.  I'll probably only put 3,500 to 5,000 miles on it per year. So that'd be a max of about 20,000 miles I'd put on it in four years (length until it's paid for assuming only doing monthly minimums).

Worth it? Vehicle appears to be in good physical shape. Have yet to test drive it but have driven one extensively in the past and would drive hundreds of miles per days some days on the interstate, poorly maintained desert roads and some sand/rock/offroad and always enjoyed it. I believe that was an 04 or 05 model, I don't recall.

Even though there is a lot of overhead lighting at night, the light is more directed inwards and not nessassarily at the fence line itself which has me needing to use my flash light often and for long period of times.


I was using a Bushnel 250 lumen flashlight I bought at Wal-Mart. I liked that it had a lock on it to prevent it from being accidentally turned on. It worked pretty well but I had to replace batteries in it all the time and now Wal-Mart no longer sells the 123A batteries it takes... So I replaced it, with a much larger 650 Lumen Ozark Trail light. This light is bright and takes 3 D sized batteries. Downside to this light is the button to turn it on/off is much too sensitive and easy to activate leaving the light turning on randomly while holstered on my belt from me running, sitting, or just walking. Can't be randomly blinding myself.

I already have a pretty decent 720P surveillance system around the house so if I'm sitting at my desk I'd see someone approach but I'd like to add a couple sensors that will make an audible noise inside once tripped.


I'd like to add a narrow beam driveway/walkway sensor to my porch entrance as it's only about 6' wide. Most sensors I looked at appear to have a wide sensor path and I need something that is narrow and more precise. Also something that is ideally battery powered, but if not, preferably 12V and I can power it direct from my solar battery bank.

For the gate latch/sensor, looking for something similar. Just something that would chime inside if the connection was broken. That way I can peak the camera stream to see if it's the UPS man, pizza guy, or someone sketchy.

You tried. It's okay. I know we poke fun at each other back and forth, but lets get serious for a moment. If you want to beat Clinton in November there is still a chance. You can still get behind and become part of a winning team, a true anti-establishment candidate who will make America great again. Whether you like it or not, you're going to benefit from America being made great again and you're going to like it. We're not that different, you and I.

You really have only two options at this point:

* Double down and increase your efforts towards Bernie. I know many of you worked hard and have been let down with the results. Hey, at least you tried. You can double down and maybe it'll pay off? Maybe it won't. Roll the dice if you feel the odds are in your favor.

* The second option is to get behind Trump, and place your support into a candidate with a real chance of defeating Clinton and breaking the status quo in this country. You can save your money, as well. Trump doesn't want or need it. Go treat yourself to something nice for your hard work and effort over the past several months as you worked towards the Sanders campaign. You deserve a treat.

Head over to /r/AskTrumpSupporters if you have any questions or concerns regarding Donald Trump and his policies. I believe many of you, once you realize he isn't ""literally Hitler"" or any of the things the dishonest media has told you, will be pleasantly surprised by the reasonableness of his proposals.

See you all in November. :)

I would like to take a quick moment to educate the Redditors who may not know about what Trump stands for and continually hear nasty ad hominems thrown at him by the Bernie Sanders dominated Reddit demographic. You'll likely be surprised just how different Trump is compared to the misleading and sensationalist headlines you read on online left wing sites like like TYT, /r/politics, Vox, Buzzfeed...etc.

This is what Trump's platform is:

* [No more nation building](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-foreign-policy-doctrine-nation-building) in the Middle East. He was also calling the Iraq War a mistake way before it was cool to do so.

* [Lower and middle class tax cuts](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform). 

* Focus on American jobs.

* Doesn't want the government charging interest on student loans: [""That’s probably one of the only things the government shouldn’t make money off. I think it’s terrible that one of the only profit centers we have is student loans"".](http://www.studentdebtrelief.us/news/donald-trump-on-the-student-loan-crisis/) Open to student loan forgiveness programs.

* Wants to [audit the Federal Reserve](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-24/donald-trump-right-here-are-100-reasons-why-we-need-audit-federal-reserve). 

* He's [genuinely against TPP](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/23/news/economy/trump-trade-deal/).

* Wants to allow states to legalize marijuana: [""Marijuana is such a big thing. I think medical should happen - right? Don't we agree? I think so. And then I really believe we should leave it up to the states.""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/29/trump-wants-marijuana-legalization-decided-at-the-state-level/)

* Doesn't have any special interests groups funding him unlike the other candidates. [Has called for all candidates to return the money they're getting back to Super PACs](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/donald-trump-return-super-pac-donations-215105) and to remove special interest groups from our election process.

* Likes [universal healthcare](http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/28/trump-60-minutes-interview-n2057986), is open to replacing America's broken system with something similar to Canada.

* Moderate on social issues (e.g. affirmative action, women's health, gay rights)

* Focus on broad-based American nationalism instead of narrow and divisive race and gender identity politics.

* Acknowledgement that political correctness is obnoxious.

* Desire to put America first in trade deals instead of pure Wall Street globalism that exploits third world workers abroad and destroys domestic jobs.

* Realist based foreign policy. (e.g. deal with Putin if it is in our national interest to do so, even if he isn't a nice guy).

* National pride. The man loves his country and thinks it is the best. Every country should have a leader like that.

* Diversity: [he employed women in leadership roles before it was popular to do that](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-a-champion-of-women-his-female-employees-think-so/2015/11/23/7eafac80-88da-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html). And he did it in the construction industry of all places. 

* He has absolutely nothing against legal immigration, [he's encouraged it many times](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/28/trump-in-favor-of-legal-immigration-only.html). His grandparents are immigrants, his wife is an immigrant, several of his closest business partners in New York are immigrants. He is against uncontrolled, illegal immigration.

* Hugely successful businessman, knows how to manage money, how to invest for the future and a fantastic negotiator. 

* Unlike other candidates, his economic plan actually makes sense. It would result in [""an 11 percent higher GDP, a 29 percent larger capital stock, 6.5 percent higher wages, and 5.3 million more full-time equivalent jobs"".](http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-s-tax-plan) 

* Take a look at this video of him [back in 1991 talking about how to utilize the upper class to re-invest in America or face higher taxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-HPlMHnORo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=86). Not only is he very knowledgable in economics and investment, but the tax structure he offers up back in 91' seems relevant even today to help alleviate some of the complaints we have about 1%'ers and wall street. 

* Acknowledges the danger of allowing mass refugees from places governed by fundamentalist terrorist groups, even if such acknowledgment is not politically correct. 


He is a HIGH ENERGY individual who has literally created tens of thousands of jobs just with his own personal business, imagine what he could do by being a leader of America. Trump is a man [deeply interested in the economic welfare of America](http://i.imgur.com/rNDQkB9.jpg), and he can't be bought.

If you're still sceptical and think he's a nazi sexist racist Hitler, ask yourself: How can he possibly be worse than what politician after politician after politician does in office? What's he going to do?

* piss off an ally by spying on them? 

* Inflame other countries by bombing their hospitals and schools and then calling it acceptable collateral damage? 

* Spend more money than we don't have? 

* Pass laws for things with good intentions, like healthcare for people who don't have it, without considering some of the gigantic gaping holes in getting it out there...like a working website to sign up for it in the first place? 

* Sit on his ass and do nothing while OPM has the biggest leak of clandestine and TS information in the history of mankind? 

* Bail out gigantic banks instead of busting them up after they fucked around and lost billions of dollars and screwed over half of the globe?

* Have the most non-secretive affair ever? Then lie about it and spend a million man hours talking about who he did or did not fuck instead of governing? 

* Cause gas lines and shortages, fail to rescue hostages from a shithole by piss poor planning? 

* Invade a country and blow it to shit without figuring out how to get back out of said country, after we just did the same thing 40 years prior? 

Seriously...how the fuck could Trump be WORSE than the parade of human turds in suits that march into the Capitol and White House every day, every year? He can't. He's the only one whose personal livelihood does not depend on contributions from outside parties, he's the only one who can stand up there and just say whatever the hell he wants without carefully walking on eggshells to not offend special interest groups. 

The sheer fact that he's universally hated by every one of those lying out of touch idiots that are currently in politics makes me want to vote for him as King let alone President. Trump is  rebuilding the GOP from the inside out, he's mixing New York moderate social values and nationalist pride, basically using the Republicans as a platform to run as an independent. This is what he said one night:

&gt;“If you look at any of the elections I've been in, every single election has been record-setting. And the good news is for the Republican party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of getting them in…New people are coming into the Republican Party. We are building a new Republican Party a lot of people are getting in.”

Go Trump. Tear down these clowns.

What is his exact platform, and beliefs? His policies are outlined below. You can, and should, visit /r/AskTrumpSupporters if you have any specific questions.

Trump has gotten a lot of negative attention as he is the true anti-establishment candidate, but at this point he's almost too strong to lose despite the non-stop attacks on him.

Read up on his policies and ask yourself if this is something you can live with. I know I certainly can:


 *What is Donald's Trump actual platform?*

No more nation building in the Middle East. He openly called the Iraq War a mistake even back when it wasn't cool to do so.

He wants lower and middle class tax cuts.

He is focused on American jobs.

He wants to reduce student loan debt. Is against the government charging interest on student loans: ""That's probably one of the only things the government shouldn't make money off – I think it's terrible that one of the only profit centers we have is student loans."" Openness to lowering student loan interest rates and making loan forgiveness programs.

Wants to audit the Federal Reserve.

Doesn't have any special interests groups funding him unlike the other candidates. Has called for all candidates to return the money they're getting back to Super PACs and to remove special interest groups from our election process.

Likes universal healthcare, is open to replacing America's broken system with something similar to Canada but better.

Moderate on social issues (e.g. affirmative action, women's health, gay rights)

Focus on broad-based American nationalism instead of narrow and divisive race and gender identity politics.

Acknowledgement that political correctness is obnoxious.

Desire to put America first in trade deals instead of pure Wall Street globalism that exploits third world workers abroad and destroys domestic jobs.

Realist based foreign policy. (e.g. deal with Putin if it is in our national interest to do so, even if he isn't a nice guy).

National pride. The man loves his country and thinks it is the best. Every country should have a leader like that.

Diversity: he employed women in leadership roles before it was popular to do that. And he did it in the construction industry of all places.

He has absolutely nothing against legal immigration, he's encouraged it many times. His grandparents are immigrants, his wife is an immigrant, several of his closest business partners in New York are immigrants. He is against uncontrolled, illegal immigration.

Hugely successful businessman, knows how to manage money, how to invest for the future and a fantastic negotiator.

Unlike other candidates, his economic plan actually makes sense. It would result in ""an 11 percent higher GDP, a 29 percent larger capital stock, 6.5 percent higher wages, and 5.3 million more full-time equivalent jobs"".

Take a look at this video of him back in 1991 talking about how to utilize the upper class to re-invest in America or face higher taxes

. Not only is he very knowledgable in economics and investment, but the tax structure he offers up back in 91' seems relevant even today to help alleviate some of the complaints we have about 1%'ers and wall street.

He's genuinely against TPP.

Acknowledges the danger of allowing mass refugees from places governed by fundamentalist terrorist groups, even if such acknowledgment is not politically correct.",politics,"Even with Sanders trailing further behind, there is still hope for defeating Clinton!

We're wanting to cover our rural and hilly county with several mobile repeaters at sights we have access to.

These three locations are each about 20 miles apart from each other in a sort of ""V"" shape, with the tip of the ""V"" being downtown in a valley and the other two locations being up on hills.

The idea is that we'd have separate repeaters all operating in uniform to give extended coverage to an area greater than what just one repeater alone could give. We plan on operating each one on solar as well, or have automatic solar fallback in the event of a power outage. Still unsure, though we both tinker with some solar stuff in our spare time. The idea is to have some sort of publicly available communication system in the event of a widespread power outage or disaster. We get bad storms each year, have been hit with tornadoes and floods and even most of the county was without power for 4 or 5 days a few years back as a result of a hurricane that came pretty far in-land. (We don't live near the coast at all...) It just seems like a fun project to undertake together as well as a useful utility for the entire community in general.

Is this possible? What is the limit to how many repeaters can operate in uniform and on the same frequency so that someone who connects to ""Point A"" could reach someone connected to ""Point C"" or ""Point B""?

&gt; Also note, some ""mushrooming"" or ""peening"" happens on all AK's. It happens because the hammer is harder than the bolt carrier. Don't be alarmed if your carrier tail shows some deformation.



So yes, the RAS47 is a budget focused American made AK47. Yes, some people had issues with them. Yes, Century Arms took note of said issues and implemented a fix.

All I do is literally *walk* around our facility for 8 hours outside. Normally I would do a lot of walking indoors, about 5-8 miles per night, but I requested a change of post as I wanted to be outside and walk even more.

So, I get home from work and take my boots off... I've got two blisters, one on each pinky toe and possibly forming in the 'knuckle' or fold or under that toe as well.

Is it likely that these blisters will continue to re-appear? Should I drain them or ignore them? I can't very well stay off my feet but will have a couple days off on Sunday and Monday that I can use to rest, but until then I'm going to have to suck it up and deal with these.

I'm posting this here in /r/hiking because I am sure this is something many of you have encountered doing long trails like the AT and PCT.

I may also consider new boots but [the ones I have](http://www.rockyboots.com/rocky-mens-boots/rocky-tmc-postal-approved-duty-chukka-boots/FQ0005005.html) aren't really all that uncomfortable. They're not horrible... not a hiking boot, but I can't wear my hiking boots... they have to be black boots, leather made with no noticeable logos for them to be work appropriate.

It's very rare that I actually OC, though I wish it was more socially accepted as I'd likely do it more. For now, I stick with doing it at the range, hiking, and sometimes in the colder months where my coat usually covers it unless the wind blows it open to reveal my sidearm. 99% of the time I just conceal carry, even though I think open carry is often times more practical despite it not being as accepted.

It's something I've been thinking about more lately and since I have an extended weekend figured I'd get more input from 'gun people' on it and their thoughts.

I've had to send the DVR back once already, had it replaced, and the issue continued. I replaced the power supply myself, and it started to work again just fine... for a while. And now it's fucked again.

Long story short, the system is now in a continuous reboot mode. This followed after it stopped detecting the disk drive installed. I couldn't reformat the drive as it didnt' detect it any longer. I rebooted the system and it continued to just reboot in a cycle.

I've unplugged the drive, as I've had to do in the past, and the issue persists. Right now after about 10 minutes of the system just continously rebooting itself I have a stream back of my four cameras but nothing is being recorded.

I've had the system for over a year now, and have had a lot of headache with it. The cameras themselves are pretty good... 720p IP cameras. I've installed some powerful IR illuminators around the house to flood areas around the house with powerful IR light for great night vision. But here is the kicker: I can't review footage from previous days. I never could. If it's 1AM, and I notice my bike is missing from my front porch I can't go back to the previous day at 11PM in the Zmodo dashboard because it's awful.

I'm done with it. I want to replace it.

Can anyone here recommend a good IP cam DVR that will allow me to utilize my existing IP cams? Upgrading to an 8 channel DVR would be nice as well, even though I only have 4 cameras right now. I may buy more later.

Thanks.

I go to the range often and would consider myself a pretty pro 2nd Amendment person and am not an idiot when it comes to gun safety.

With that said, I do *rarely* OC, usually in the colder months as my open coat generally covers it anyway or when I am hiking or like right now, when I am at home. It's a comfort thing. I'd OC more probably if I lived somewhere where more people did it, it's rare that I see others do it here so I generally don't either.

Luckily I live in a great gun state that supports gun owner's rights to carry. I've got a lifetime carry license and can either conceal or open carry with it. Furthermore, businesses who place ""No guns allowed"" sign are simply expressing their personal views as those signs hold no weight of law. (Meaning you're not breaking the law for simply carrying in a private business with this sign, though you must leave if asked unless you want to be charged with trespassing).

Anyhow, using the search function I decided to read some open carry related topics here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/search?q=open+carry&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all at of random curiosity and I expected to see a lot of support for it.

I was quite surprised to see how almost every top comment in discussions regarding open carry was people stating that they support 'citizens' carrying but thought OC was stupid and dumb.

Everyone I know who OC's are gun enthusiasts like me. We go to the range, we shoot often and safely. A lot of folks who I know OC shoot more often than what *most* officers likely would shoot to maintain their annual firearms training requirements. Most carry in proper holsters and rigs. No child is going to walk up and remove someone's firearm while they wait in line at McDonald's. My OC rig for my Glock is a SERPA Blackhawk with a finger release similar to what most of you probably use. My OC rig for my SW4566 is a leather holster with a thumb break snap as well. 

Why do you feel that it is 'dumb' or 'stupid' to OC? I personally feel like it's a safer and more secure way than having it tucked into a IWB holster, especially on rigs like my Glock. Even though I am putting it into a proper Galco King Tuck holster I feel like it's more dangerous of a rig than my OC rig. Same thing with my Kahr or anything else with no external safety. I know it's a lot more comfortable to carry openly than having a gun pressed against your side while walking, sitting, driving, etc. (Not that it's super uncomfortable in a IWB rig... but no IWB rig has been more comfortable than a good OC rig)

The only time I turn my nose up to someone OCing is when it's done so poorly... like some shitty Hi-Point in a nylon holster on a cheap Wal-Mart belt in some poor fitting clothing. Most everyone I know who OC's does so in what would be considered business casual or proper fitting 'country boy' clothes (Jeans, t-shirt, or button up work shirt) and it doesn't look tacky, doesn't look like crazed maniacs, etc. I still support their right to do it though, I'm just a gun snob I guess. :P

The threads I read were a couple years old. Maybe things are different now. What are your thoughts on folks OCing? If you see a physically fit guy in proper fitting clothes carrying in a proper OC rig what are your thoughts? Has there been any cited sources of someone being a victim of violent crime because they were OCing?

I mean, 44 states allow open carry. It's not like it should be a rare thing. As an officer, wouldn't you rather know someone is carrying than not know? My state is in the top ten in the nation for issued carry licenses / permits and statistically one out of ten people you may encounter could be lawfully carrying, most choose concealed.

In recap:

Open carry is (arguably):

* More comfortable
* ""Safer"" in some ways.
* A way to signal to other like minded people or to show off your fancy Sig, Kimber or custom 1911. It's hard to make new friends when you get older. :P
* Looks fine when you dress like a respectable person (even in just jeans and a t-shirt it looks fine if they fit properly)
* Possible crime deterrent by presence alone (Ah shit, they got someone in there that may be an off duty cop or some guy is in there with a gun)
