0,"I'd personally go the other way actually. If you ban Crowns best champion he is still one of the best players in the world on his 2nd,3rd ,4th and even 5th best champions so their actually isn't that big of a reward for banning his best champion. Where as if you take away huhi's Asol and Vlad Their is a massive drop off to next best champion. 


Tldr: Huhi's champion pool is a massive liability and teams take advantage of it. Teams don't ban crowns best champion because they respect his ability to play and wide variety of champions at an incredible level.",2016-10-24 21:00:49+00:00,d964hm6,2.0,t1_d93ogkx,159220.0,CLG

21,Based on the statement by Complexity it seems a factor in why they chose to replace him with uber was that he did not want to move into their team house.

28,"After seeing how well TSM did picking up premier stars If I was getting NA players I would definetly want to give players like brehze, Nahte, No_one, subroza, Tekaru a good solid look. IMO it's usually better to look at players that show tons of potential but haven't gotten a chance to play at the highest level then picking players who have had lots of opportunity but could never show they desereved to be their. Having said that sometimes a player can fail based on situation not a lack of effort or skill so I would probably also want to give players like just9n, uber and possibly even jasonr a good look to. I also think CLG should try and find a new coach as soon as possible. 
Regardless of who you guys get for the two open player spots the rest of 2016 is probably going to be quite difficult for you guys but if you really dedicate your self to becoming a great IGL and everyone works their ass off and buys into what your doing I truthfully think you could break into the top ten by the end of the year.

33,It's probably a combination of issues. I think one of his major issues is that he doesn't want to live in the team house. If you think about it when the players went on a break Tarik stayed at his house for almost 3 weeks longer then the rest of the team only coming back a week and a half before e league then after e league all the players went back to the team house except Tarik who instead went back to his house. Combine that with the fact that when Thorin was talking about clg in the koosta/JDM trade video he was saying our management was doing a bad job and taking to much of a lol approach specifically saying that cs players do not want team houses.,2016-06-27 19:54:00+00:00,d4q9zhc,3.0,t1_d4q20bh,9953.0,CLG
34,the only reason I put probably not a hacker is because if you ever mention his name with roster changes everyone says no because he is a cheater.

As a player brehze has shown that he has excellent aim and a knack for winning clutches against some fairly strong competition something that clg is sorely lacking so I think that he is still a decent option for us.,2016-06-17 18:09:27+00:00,d4dbz4j,5.0,t1_d4ce0mv,63052.0,CLG

158,"I don't know why you are complaining about roles. For the most part CLG is actually winning more rounds on the T side then they did before the changes. The problem is that CLG is consistently losing CT halves on heavily CT favored maps and sometimes by huge margins (4-11 vs c9 overpass, 3-12 vs astralis overpass, 5-10 vs REN inferno, 5-10 vs g2 inferno) Realistically you will not beat any good teams if you continue these atrocious CT halves. If you ask me we need to give our players more freedom to go make a pick or push somewhere to take some map control (this is something that Tarik is especially good at) so that you can set up a nice flank, even if It doesn't work you still get information that you can rotate a player into a better position for the push . Right now we are just playing super passive and getting very little in terms of information to work with. So what you have is a naturally aggressive player being asked to play passively which is something hes not really comfortable with. You give him no information and almost never rotate someone to help. Then when they got to take the cite you ask him to do what he can and play retake with the rest of your members",2016-02-19 20:33:57+00:00,d06a6t2,1.0,t3_46jv8h,38968.0,CLG

I know a lot of people probably have immortals finishing higher then that but I think the increased tp cooldown and the emergence of tanks top will greatly reduce huni and reignovers carry potential plus I don't think they will have amazing shotcalling to back them up like they did in fnatic. Another surprise might be dignitas but I actually thought they showed a decent performance at iem so I don't think 7-11 is to farfetched. Now for CLG, at iem clg showed a great ability to forge comebacks with superior map movement and team fighting but also showed a general weakness in there laneing phase, they also did not prove that they are able to carry games from places other then top lane with there new roster which will be even more important as the meta looks to shift towards more tanks top. Despite some of these worries I think our teams superior p/b and shotcalling will lead us to a solid 11-7 4th place finish for this regular season.

205,the stats are from hltv. I just find it extremely suspicious that he would delete the vod immediately after seeing that picture. regardless I think that c9 is probably getting a european for there fifth probably schnieder or pronax.,2016-01-07 23:04:10+00:00,cypxee7,6.0,t1_cype2e4,26897.0,Cloud9

207,You can't really be signed in on two accounts on the same computer at the same time so seems unlikely. Tsm rumoured roster was also in game and not FPLing at the same time so it seems that he probably won't be with tsm or c9.,2016-01-07 18:26:42+00:00,cypl6dq,6.0,t1_cyp1vwu,44993.0,CLG
208,Its a lot different though because stewie is coming up against some players who have 10+ years of pro experience where as doublelift was playing a game where pro play had only existed for 6 months or so. it is a lot easier to become a top player with pure mechanical skill if the players your up against only have 6 months of experience to back them up compared to 10 years IMO. ,2016-01-07 07:35:55+00:00,cyp43up,4.0,t1_cyp3n0f,1416.0,CLG

211,Oh I totally misunderstood you then. If Tarik really is staying with CLG then my prediction would be that we get stewie and c9s fifth will be schnieder. Unless the team stewie was referring to was moes new team.,2016-01-07 01:10:51+00:00,cyos4k2,4.0,t1_cyoru0e,474.0,CLG

215,He's a lot like doublelift when clg first got him way back when he has insane mechanical skill and is kind of immature and cocky. Pros don't think he will be able to translate his skills to competitive because he plays unintelligently and that will get punished much harder in competitive CS.,2016-01-07 00:36:41+00:00,cyoqucp,2.0,t1_cyoqlkl,377.0,CLG
216,If it is a player that starts with s and has 9 letters it could be schnieder. He is confirmed to be leaving hell raisers and hasn't announced a new team. Also Pimp seemed pretty hyped about the new C9 player which to me suggests that its probably a eu player because he probably doesn't know all that much about the NA talent pool but knows a ton about the eu talent pool and the only NA player that is being rumored with c9 that hes ever played against is Tarik. So I would completely rule out all NA players except Tarik.,2016-01-06 23:18:08+00:00,cyonq99,3.0,t1_cynx44d,42903.0,GlobalOffensive

218,Tarik tied shroud and hiko for the second highest rating of all NA players in 2015 so statistically speaking at least he is a top 5 NA player.

If clg were to try this one of two thing would likely happen either huhi and froggen would work hard with each other to improve there weaknesses or the team could get really confused from trying to play with two different mids and it could be detrimental to further improvement from the team.,2015-11-30 04:45:44+00:00,cxhlgqa,1.0,t3_3usugx,5653.0,CLG

Especially when you consider how much huhi seems to be struggling in solo que right now.

Also nihilium almost never practised and they said one of the big reasons why was his streaming deal with NVidia which requires him to stream twice a day so clg is probably a lot better off without him,2015-08-02 02:45:36+00:00,ctoi9y8,1.0,t3_3fgvl3,2844.0,CLG
