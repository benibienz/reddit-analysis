I also don't think there is enough talent on our roster to attract top eu players to come to our team so I personally don't really think that the taking the Liquid approach is even really possible.

What I think we should do is try to fill our two open spots is pick up two raw NA talents such as players like Brehze, No_one, Nahte, Tekaru, Subroza or ichibann. We should then move cutler back into an Igl role and pickup a coach so that we can teach the young puggers how to play in a structured environment. The approach of taking a couple young puggers and placing them in a team with some seasoned veterans really seemed to work for tsm, but one of the keys to this working is cutting players relatively quickly if they aren't working out which is something that clg does not have a track record of doing.

Obviously if I'm wrong and picking up top players like magiskb0y is possible then I think tha is a better approach but looking at the current na talent pool and our roster I can' t really see it happening.

On a side note I think it's super disappointing that CLG has done such a shitty job Managing the CS squad that a player is basically sitting at home waiting for his contract to run out for 7 months because he doesn't want to play for us but can't go anywhere else because of a huge buyout on his contract.",CLG,[CSGO] CLG should take the TSM approach to rebuilding the roster,https://www.reddit.com/r/CLG/comments/4sd66c/csgo_clg_should_take_the_tsm_approach_to/

For me the player that I think is probably most likely to be the replacement is Maikalele given his relationship with pita and that he is still teamless.

I honestly am not sure that I think that maikalele would be a great option considering he would likely not get an awp in his hands very often.
