I can't recall the history correctly, so it might be an erroneous history I'll tell, but there's a history where Job (or whatever he's called) hears that god will exterminate a city called Sodoma, because the inhabitants - or the so-called ""Sodomites"" - are exclusively homosexuals, and God consider them as everything wrong with humanity - literally. Job refuses to believe, that no good homosexuals and everyone's rampant, as God insists. God comes with a proposition, that sounds like this: ""If you're able to find at least 1 homosexual, then I'll spare them"". Job accepts the challenge, then subsequently visits the city, and realizes they're as rampant as God insisted.

When you're looking at a person, you're usually assessing who they are, and your persoanl style especially affects your first impression: If you're wearing round glasses and tucked your turtleneck, people will usually consider you as the stereotypical nerd. Also a bit more elaborate example is if you're wearing some bright colors, people will consider you as delightful, confident and an optimistic character. However, if you're wearing completely black or monotone outfit, people will consider you as the opposite (Skeptical, doubtful and pessimistic). 

Basically, clothes and your personal style have attitude and colors emphasizes that point, *significantly*. 

Last thing I'll mention is that clothes is especially aimed at what culture you appeal to. Whether it's skating or it's being another generic nerd.

I LOVED it, and i was impressed and satisfied.
