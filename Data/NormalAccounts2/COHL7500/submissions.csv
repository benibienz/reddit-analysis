I usually don't shout out services, as it's  somewhat a sellout and it doesn't really benefit me to shout out a service out whatsoever, but I think this individual deserves it:
---

Okay, so from a few days ago, I was listing a thread up pertaining my need of a proxy. However, I didn't specify my actual country, so it's obvious that people'd initially assume that I'm from US. 


When I was going to pay, he showed me his [website](http://www.supremeservices.bigcartel.com/), and I realized it was exclusively for America. I became somewhat nervous, as I didn't have the time to arrange another deal. I knew that if I didn't acquire a proxy, there'll be this disputed succession for the manualers^#actualcommunity that'll derive from proxies and bots in general.


I texted him back and told him I wasn't able to utilize his services because of my current location, then this one man with a Hugh Mungus dick tells me he'll use a VPN for my order. I was hesitating whether it'll work or not, I got a message that the order was [sucessfully ordered](http://imgur.com/p0naNiW)


My gratitude to this man is immeasurable. I think it's true dedication that a man selling several proxy services will go out his way to support an European.

EDIT IN TITLE: HOW TO CHECK WHETHER YOUR BAPE HOODY IS AUTHENTIC

how to tell if your hoodys are real

my dirty dozen:

1) sleeve tag - milo/ape should be centered. for baby milos - inside of sleeve tag should have the word 'milo' with pink/red alternating diagonally 

2) inside zipper - should read ykk only for bape, ykk+5vs+vislon for baby milo

3) inside lining - should not be fleecy - should feel live woven cotton

4) stitching - there should be few or no loose threads

5) colorway - should be vibrant, not dull

6) zipper - should be totally concealed with no effort. zipper should be metal and shiny for bape (non baby milo)

7) fabric - should be a tight knit - when u pull apart the fabric u should not see any spacing or white

smokeyface plastic ziplock bag should have a white tab with factory sticker of size

9) pricing - no hoody should be priced under retail ($300)

10) there shouldn't be any 3xl or 4xl sizes

11) sellers with multiple sizes of the same item aka choose your size

12) seller should not be trying to school you on how to tell if it's real - most fape sellers will tell u the opposite of all these things. also, seller shouldn't pause when u ask there they bought it from

We're searching for 2 experienced players. If you're acquainted with every Heist's procedure, then you're adequate for my/our part. We'll not use Mic, but if you want to facilitate it for yourself, then you're welcome to use Voice Chat. Remember, that everything's set on HARD and no mistakes should be committed, as I doubt your patient enough to complete all the Heists again. 

I've already conceived a plan, that essentially requires me to buy a house near the Lectro's. The plan's probably recognizable for you.

My level's 86 and my friend's 59. Although my friend's a somewhat low level, she's also leveled SOLELY on Heists. She's only played 3-4 Contact missions. 

  QUICK REQUIREMENT OVERVIEW (TL;DR) 

 - Experienced with every Heist 

 - Be at least level 30 (We're pretty apathetic concerning your level, but it can be difficult if you're not at level 10, as you're unskilled in the skill system. 

 - Having the time to actually complete this Challenge.

So, i were going to the nearest mall near me (only 3-4 mins from my house), to get to the GameStop Store, as i were after the Fallout: Anthology, i thought too i'd want to check up on my Pip-Boy Edition, that it were reserved, and were able to get it to the release.

When i got to the GameStop Store, i checked up on the Vinyl POP Statues, and saw if there were some Fallout ones. There were not a single one, and they had 50 different ones. I went over to the desk and asked for Fallout: Anthology, and then he said ""We have something called Fallout 4: Anthology, not Fallout: Anthology"" i were a bit confused, and thought it were just a mistake, but cause i needed to assure that i weren't going to buy the wrong, i just waited with that for asking about the details, and ask if i would get my Pip-Boy Pre-order, as i knew they were totally sold out.

 I tell him first my own number, then he answers ""Nope, nothing pre-ordered on this number"", i became a bit nervous, as that's the typical number i pay my things under, then i gave him 3 different numbers. None of them were something pre-ordered on, i told him that i had the coupon for the game. I were confused, and he were as confused as me i can say. So he called his Boss as an alternative, after 1 minute or earlier he said that it were because they fucked up, so you weren't able to see the Pip-Boy Edition on their system, whatsoever. He said that i got it secured for the release, and i'll get it to the release. I were so happy to hear that, as i immediately went over to the Store for getting the Pip-Boy Edition when it were announced. 

Then i asked if the Fallout (4): Anthology will come out the 2nd October, and he said that i were correct. So i knew it were the right one and got it secured for the release.

LOOTING: Looting will be in real time, no pause whatsoever. It'll be a little window you can scroll through.

NAMES: The 1000 Names on the list will also be names focused on levity; It'll be unserious some of them, like Mr. Fuckface!

CITIES: A Bit of Diamond City was shown (Concept Art). some of the Attendees say that they saw it were covered in snow, which'll mean there may be snow. The gameplay were located in Lexington!

DIALOGUE: Dialogue will be incredibly flexible: It'll be able to have a conversation with 2 other people at same time, like a conversation in a group.

COMPANIONS: Companions confirmed is Piper (A girl character, and no she's not that hot.) Located in Diamond City, Mr. Handy (A Robot like Codsworth), Preston Garvey (The leader of the Minutemen, or sort of). There'll also be relationships! No matter the gender you are, you can always be a couple with a boy or a girl.
 
PIP-BOY: When you look at the Pip-Boy, the game will pause. Even in combat of course. Inventory's also now easier to get to, as there's a quick select screen for throwing grenades and using stimpaks, etc. And this will not pause the game.

ANIMATIONS: Animations will now appear when you're using Meds, such as Stimpak, where you'll be bursting it into your chest. There are a lot of different animations, and they're way more detailed than before, even Dogmeat has a ton of little detailed animations for everything he does. AI will now also have the feature of jumping and climbin some obstacles, and they jumped through the window in the show.

KARMA/REPUTATION: There'll be procedural reactions to you, based of your reputation and Karma, so Karma will get it's respect in the game.

WEAPONS: Nothing really special of what we've seen whatsoever. There was an Automatic Plasma Rifle, but not really anything else. You can also find modified weapons in the Wasteland, and this may depend on your luck how modified it is. You can also melee with your weapon now, even if there's not a bayonet attached to your weapon!  

PERKS/PERKS UI: Looked like a Jeopardy Board says some: 7 Categories and 10 Rows sat after increasingly better perks, what seen that were new was Intimidation and Attack Dog! Perks will also be depend on your S.P.E.C.I.A.L, For example: the higher your Perception, then earlier on you'll get access to a perk dedicated to Perception.  

GHOULS: Ghouls has changed a lot now, so it feels like they've changed character heavily (when you're comparing FO3 AND FO:NV): They're walking differently, like they've got some mentally impairing disorder, and the animations looks pretty fluid.

LEGENDARY: Many other enemies and such will be legendary, even human-like creatures, such as Ghouls.

BEHEMOTHS: Some Behemoths were unquestionably bigger than the one in the trailer. Some even say as big as they were in Fallout 3.

RECORDED?: It's being doubted, as they had pretty good security in the room.

HACKING: Nothing special to talk about, closely at being the same as in the third dimensional games of Fallout. 

BOOKS: (Some) Books are now actually readable, like Grognak The Barbarian, with different issues!

SKILLS: No such thing anymore, and will be replaced with Perks, and it's not a disappointment calmly said.

THINGS TO KEEP UPDATED ON: They'll be updating their Fallout 4 Site (possibly every second week) with a new video shown of the different S.P.E.C.I.A.L on their official Website.

Looks completely normal, but in Gun Nut (Rank 3.) you're tongue hangs out and vault boy having big eyes, as this symbolises how obsessed he is, and it'll look (probably) even more obsessed in higher ranks of the perk. I were not able to make an Imgur, but you can check this Gun Nut example out by: 1. Check in the building part of the showcase, when he's placing a sentry, it says it requires Gun Nut (Rank 1.) 2. Set it on Slow-motion at the gun building part, then you'll see many times the Gun Nut perk at Rank 3.

I found out that it doesn't matter with Rank, but still there's different animations for the Gun Nut icon at least: In the Weapon Building part, we see him looking a lot more obsessed with guns than in the sentry part.
