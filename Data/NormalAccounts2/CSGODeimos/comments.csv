33,"1) What specs do you have?

CPU: Intel Core i7 6700k 4.0 ghz
GPU: ASUS STRIX GTX 1070 8GB
MEM: 16 GB Corsair Vengeance 

2) what sort of FPS are you getting on a full 72 server? Not entirely sure but I never experience any lag at all. Probably 70+

Avg FPS: Last time I check it was 70-90 with everything maxed out

3) How happy are you (with the overall game) on a scale of 1-5 (whole numbers. If someone includes a .5 or such it will be rounded based on standard rounding rules.)

Happiness (1-5 scale): 5

Notes/Specific happiness feedback: Being a player that originally came from the very first public alpha of PR in BF2 when I was 12 years old, I can't even begin to tell you how happy you've made me. I'd literally given up on gaming, I wasn't enjoying it anymore. I thought this was due to me getting older but I've come to realize it's not that at all, it's that the quality of games have gone down hill drastically. 

You've restored my faith in developers, gaming and the whole community in general. I have to let you know that my wife's not to happy though, I'm playing to much and not giving her enough attention lol.

Any ETA on having sniper + spotter roles? Do you guys have any movie making tools planned? I'd like to be able to save my matches, watch from third/free look etc. I love to make movies/gameplay videos in my spare time so I feel like this would be great for those of us that do. Only asking because I missed the AMA.

Cheers,

They refused to let me shoot even though I'm a permanent resident. They literally asked for no info or anything. They just said ""You're not shooting here."" with no reason, nothing.

&amp;nbsp;

When we were waiting in line to rent a lane, I could see the guy behind the counter just looking me up and down. Guess he didn't like me for some unknown reason. (I wasn't acting like an idiot, was having a casual conversation about something work related).


&amp;nbsp;

I used my SS number, filled all the info in. I guess it's because it's the first firearm I've bought from a store. The guys at the store are decent, I don't think it's their fault. It's probably just a precaution I guess. I have a few mil-surplus rifles and a shotgun but I received some of those as gifts and the shotgun I bought at a country flea market.

414,"&gt; *It's so tiring to hear him push himself into everyone's talk like a fucking twelve-year-old.*

That's not even the case. That's a silly comment to make in my opinion. Thorin openly debates and states his views. Now, the problem is that not many casters or analysts debate or even remotely seem like they care about the different aspects of the game.

That's what the game is about. Look at casters and analysts in other sports, do you see monotone people that fill silence gaps by rambling about pointless topics? No, you see more people with personailities similar to Thorin, DDK and James.  

eSports is growing and with the growth we can expect changes in a few areas and this is one of them.

Another caster that bugs me is SirScoots, the man rambles more than any other caster I know. Some of the stuff he comes out with is just nonsense and makes him sound oblivious.

No, in all seriousness. You're 100% right, at least half the community is toxic and what did this? What led to kids being toxic little fucks with no regard for other peoples feelings or dignity? The internet. The internet did it. 

You're never going to change the community because society has changed and has led to people becoming dicks online because they think there's no repercussions. People show their true identity online. People are bitter, twisted and toxic. I guarantee the kids that say toxic shit online, most likely either get bullied in real life and this is their way of dealing with it or haven't been taught respect by their imbecile parents.

665,This is a good idea. Gives people a sense of competitiveness but they're not achieving a rank until they've played for a while.,2015-12-19 11:27:33+00:00,cy4ekg4,3.0,t1_cy3mmt5,62016.0,GlobalOffensive

672,"It's not going to matter sadly. People that code can rewrite to bypass updates or fixes in a matter of minutes. I had a mate that used to do it in loads of games, not just CSGO. They'll never be stopped and it's sad because it ruins the game for so many people.",2015-11-25 14:45:26+00:00,cxcliw1,1.0,t3_3u7kg6,7329.0,GlobalOffensive
