Hey guys, 

On Saturday I tried to record 4-5 hours of Squad gameplay for editing only to find that none of the videos had sound. I thought it was just a one off so I again on Sunday. It worked fine, edited uploaded.

Tried again today after work, 4 hours of gameplay, split up per match. No sound. This is driving me insane. I had probably one of the funnest matches of Squad, thought I had captured it all and I didn't because of this shitty issue.

I found a cheap Anderson LPK and bought a nice CTR Magpul Stock + buffer tube + spring. I rushed home, just moved into an apartment so I don't really have many tools apart from a hammer, screw driver and a drill. I was following the Iraqveteran8888 tutorial for building a lower.

&amp;nbsp;


I started hammering the trigger guard pin through the side of the lower receiver and thought, this feels a bit stiff.. It went right through on the video, I carried on thinking ""Maybe I'm just a pussy"" and now I currently have the trigger guard pin stuck a quarter of the way through and it won't budge at all. I thought to myself, it's okay, I'll use a vice at work and fix it. I'll move on and get done what I can with the tools I have.


&amp;nbsp;



(I stopped following the tutorial at this point, which also wasn't wise). I moved on to putting my buffer tube in. I started screwing it in, holding down my buffer detent spring + plunger, got it nice and tight before realising ""oh, I'm a moron, I didn't put the buffer and spring in. So I casually begin to unscrew it, forgetting that I held my latch plate down when screwing it so that the tiny buffer detent plunger and spring down stayed safe.


&amp;nbsp;



Only god knows where my buffer detent plunger is currently.. the spring landed on my lap but the plunger has vanished. I'm guessing this is a thing that happens to beginners often? Or maybe I'm just an idiot lol.

Hey guys, I posted a few days ago about wanting to build my first AR. I'm a permanent resident in the US, been here a while now. Own some firearms already.


&amp;nbsp;

I went into my local gun store today and purchased a Stag Arms Lower Receiver, filled out the paperwork as usual but he told me that when he did the background check it said I had to wait till the 2nd and pick it up then.  


&amp;nbsp;  
Any reason for this? (Been in there multiple times with my boss from work, who's good friends with them and they know me semi-well).

I moved to the US around 6 months ago from the UK, firearms have always been big interest and a hobby of mine. Always loved reading about them, how they function, etc. I used to own multiple de-activated collectables in the UK, since it's practically impossible to own them in the UK. I've bought a few rifles over the past few months but I've still not gotten myself an AR.


I'm stuck in the dilemma of whether to buy pre-built, buy a complete upper/lower or build from scratch. Here's the thing.. I'm picky but on a budget. I want an A3/Flat-top style.
My wife will literally kill me if I go spend 2500 on a new gun (I bought my first shotgun at a fair last week and she wasn't too happy about that ':D)


What are the full or best parts manufactuers for a new guy on a budget? I wish I could afford a Daniel Defense V5 but I can't afford that kind of gun at the moment.

I've been trying to solve this issue for over a week on my local server so I finally decided to upload it to a server and seek help else where. I'm really a beginner when it comes to web design and development.

Basically, my menu buttons randomly became unaligned and they will not go back into place. I've tried changing all attributes in the CSS stylesheets, I've tried playing around with header.php and mobile php pages but nothing.

Another problem is the boxes on the home page if you scroll down, are seeping off the page. I'm not sure how to fix that either. I tried making them smaller and the footer still overlaps.

Any help?

http://www.westnewtonsupply.com is the website, just a practice site for me.

Thank you in advance.

I'm going to try and be unique and different to the other large standard setting gaming channels. I always interract with followers, I play games with the majority of them and will always be like that. No matter how large I grow, no matter how large a following.

Own a few social media pages, 95% of the content I post is created by me, Instagram page is almost at 7,000 followers.
