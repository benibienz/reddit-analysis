Came up with this, pretty solid build and you've got capability to expand into a crossfire setup in a few years. I know you said you don't plan on overclocking but for your budget, you may as well look into it down the road if you need to squeeze any more performance out of your setup, if you really don't want to you can swap down to a H97 board as well as removing the CPU cooler and going down to a non 'k' CPU, should save you about $70.

**EDIT**  This is the build if you don't want to overclock, saves about $70.

237,"The GB of the video card is the VRAM or video memory, generally having a higher texture/resolution requires more VRAM, you can find the recommended amount of VRAM on a games specifications, hardly any games will take advantage of 8GB. It's not all about the video memory though, the two cards you are comparing are very different, the 390 and the 960 are both from two different manufactures and offer different clock speeds and overclockability. Seen as you likely won't be focusing on overclocking I'd recommend just looking on youtube for things like 'AMD 390 vs GTX 960' so you can get an idea on how they perform in games that you play. Remember the card with the highest amount of VRAM is not always the best card, it's whatever suits your needs and budget.

The difference between the i5-4590 and the i5-6600 is most noticeably the numbers, these are the generations of the CPU's, for example an ix-6xxx is always a Skylake proccessor, and ix-4xxx is Haswell. Skylake and Haswell are both different generations of Intel CPU's. There are lots of other differences between CPU's such as number of cores/threads and different clock speeds, if you don't want to get into detail then I'd recommend just also looking at benchmarks for different CPU's for things you'd like to use your computer for. Skylake (ix-6xxx) is generally more expensive as it is the newest line of processors from Intel, whilst Haswell (ix-4xxx) is slightly older (Mid 2014). I wouldn't take the latest processor for gaming, processors are not outdated as quickly as GPU's and you won't see huge increase. Skylake systems at the momment offer less performance/per dollar in games compared to Haswell. Your video card is the main factor in performance in games.",2016-01-26 22:12:58+00:00,czd37lz,3.0,t1_czd1bx8,2547.0,buildapcforme
238,"It depends on your budget/how many existing games you have. An SSD is generally good to start with if so you can install your OS/Primary programs and a few games and then you can expand onto a HDD, I wouldn't recommend trying to do the opposite as it is a lot of hassle to move an OS over to another drive if its your first time. I'd recommend 120GB - 250GB for your OS and primary programs with some room for quite a few games.

Came up with this, you should be able to play most of the latest titles with high-max settings at 1080p. 

&gt; I've also noticed that many people have both a SSD and a hard drive, why is that? Wouldn't just 1 large SSD suffice?

SSD's are much more expensive per GB than a hard drive. Most people run their primary programs, such as their operating system, web browser, steam, skype or other applications on their SSD as these don't take up much storage. As most people can't afford an SSD large enough to store their an entire steam library, they have a HDD to store large things that they don't need instant access too.

It only leaves 20$ left in your budget to get the CPU/CPU cooler so if you could go over by $30 then this build is solid and will smash the 390/970.

451," &gt; Guys give this a try. It worked for me in PC after everything else failed. Download CheatEngine 6.4 @ http://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php Cheat engine is really helpful in the case of lag. Lag in the game is the one that is affecting the button mashing. So, download Cheat engine 6.4 and install it. When it finishes open it and then open the game. After the game reaches the main menu press alt+tab to minimize the game and use cheat engine. Note that going inside the walkthrough and using cheat engine may make the game crashes. On the left corner of the programme, you will find, under ""file"", a computer-like icon that says ""select a process to open"". Click on that, scan for ACU, choose it, and click on open. On the right side of the programme, there are to things that are unchecked. Check the one that says ""Enable Speedhack"", type 0.2 in the speed box that appears, and then click""apply"".  When you go back to the game, you will notice that everything has slowed down. Now, continue the campaign (would be better if you had saved it during the fight with bellec), and keep playing until you reach the button mashing scene. Keep pressing E as you used to do, and it will hopefully work. After the cutscene ends and the game saves in the next scene, you can safely go back to the programme and uncheck speedhack. Note: when you are fighting bellec with slow motion and trying to stagger him, arno might not complete the move, so you will have to hold the space for a longer time to cope with the slow motion movement. Also, if 0.2 is not working for you after several trials, you can try different numbers.""
