Finally got around to finishing this build before new year, had a 
delay in the arrival of some parts which led to be not being able to finish it until after Christmas. I had a spare GTX 970 lying around that I plan on selling at some point so I added it into my new build as a dedicated PhysX card. Used a Corsair 25% code that I got from over at /r/pcmasterrace to get my Corsair Link. Noticed some card sag as my 970 is considerably more heavy than my 980 Ti, does anyone have any suggestions for a household item that I might be able to use it give it some support?

**You can't choose which game you'll get, if you get a winning number you'll be given the game with the corresponding hash.**

**Dino D-Day - Company of Heros - Yet Another Zombie Defense - Hitman Absolution**

Each game has it's own unique number that I've turned into a hash using the SHA-1 algorithm.

In this format:

[Random text/number][Correct Number] = hash

The hash's for each game are as follows:

Hitman Absolution = 
e64366c90d6c646933e6e2e9f0d0c4d8ca6b4280


Yet Another Zombie Defense = 153cb282502ed8aad0fd602fa44c6f21b248df26


Company of Heros = 468c34a312e1b9c2d035d2e1c30b67ae468c4b1b


Dino D-Day = 03e9ed5897b842afd804a59e7728857c551568d9


At the end of the giveaway I'll release the random text/numbers so you can check those against the winning numbers to prove that I've not tampered/changed them during the raffle.
