The caller would either become upset and angry at me when (they thought) we got past the ""code"" but I'd then ""refuse"" to tell then what kind of car I was selling, with me repeating ""It's a Kia Sephia"" and them asking, ""Is it a Toyota, or what?"" and me saying over and over ""No, it's a Kia!""

DMT only lasts 15-20 minutes at the most when smoked. If you smoked in the car, you'd have to wander your way through the parking lot, get into the theater, and find your seat in low light.

10,"&gt;I did my research on it and now I am quite scared especially since I haven't done any psychedelics. 

Maybe I'm biased, but DMT was the first psychedelic I did too, and it's really nothing to be scared off. It sounds daunting because of how powerful it is, but it's not dangerous at all. The very worst that could possibly happen is that you have a bad trip (the chances of which are very slim), and even if you do it'll last 20 minutes at most. 

I'd say try it, and if you're really really worried just take a small hit. My first ""trip"" was a small bowl of changa split between me and a friend.

I tried candyflipping at a party a few months ago, but I think my tolerance to acid was high from a recent trip, so I pretty much only felt the MDMA. Just recently though, I went to a festival, took two tabs and chased it a couple hours later with .2 g of fire molly my friend got a hold of. 

I felt pretty great all night, but the peak was almost indescribably good.

I hit it pretty hard and exhaled a good bit of plastic flavored smoke. Is it possible my ACRB was bunk? I got it off a highly rated Ebay seller, but that might not mean much.


@mttp 

Yeah, I'll probably try a re-x when I do another extraction with the bark I have left. As a general question for you and any other experienced extractors: the guide for Cyb's tek recommends decanting your naphtha into multiple dishes, but is it really necessary to do so? I used three dishes, and it seems like I had such a tiny amount of wax in each that it would have been better to just use one dish.

As another general question, if it's allowed and doesn't violate opsec or anything: Would you guys recommend any sources for good MHRB or ACRB? It's not that I don't trust my current source, but I'd like to leave as little to doubt as possible next time I attempt a tek.",2016-03-20 06:36:47+00:00,d16id0o,2,t1_d153oly,113965,DMT
