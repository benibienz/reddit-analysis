My last two trips I've taken 300μg, and the most I got in the way of visuals was a ""breathing"" effect on text. Meanwhile my friends have taken 100-200μg of the same tabs, and saw way more stuff.

Does acid just affect everyone differently, or is there something I can do to improve the visuals on my trip?

Can anyone help me pinpoint what I've done wrong? I think I did pretty well up until I had to drain off my naphtha with an eye dropper. It took a while to get the precise technique down, and instead of a big flat layer of milky liquid like in the pictures, I ended up with some dried white puddles and a little bit of liquid solvent.

Sorry if something like this has been asked before, but I looked around and couldn't find a definitive answer:

I'm interested in trying extraction for myself, but I'm not sure which tek or material to use to do it. ACRB appears to be the easiest and most economical for me to obtain, but the majority of teks I see seem to use MHRB.

Is ACRB derived product significantly different from stuff derived from MHRB? If not explicitly stated like in the Lextek documentation on the wiki, do teks work regardless of the type of plant material you're using?",DMT,Is there a best/preferred tek or root bark to use for extraction?,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/49kr91/is_there_a_bestpreferred_tek_or_root_bark_to_use/
