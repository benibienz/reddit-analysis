I'm normally in the back on the wok (expanded prep area) and it gets very lonely when the person working kitchen that night isn't social. :( But providing excellent customer service isn't hard if you are following the 5 steps to exceptional customer service.) It's just hard learning to do everything else at once. I'm at a hybrid store. So we have extra things. The hot bar. Salad bar. Olive bar. Fresh cheese shop.

119,"If you can handle decorating go for it! It's not an easy road!! I made the same choice. I had never even frosted with duncin hines frosting before. They sent me to a six week training course for decorating and then I made it Decorator about a year later or so. I also was in bakery for about 4 out of my 6 years with the company. I was trying to get into management. I passes all my tests with wonderful scores. But if you just don't have a manager in your corner, unfortunately none of that matters. The bakery is high strung and there is always work that needs to be done. No down time. In the long run I switched to deli, no looking back. I love deli and i am committed to working my way to a department manager for this department. If it seems like I am rambling. I probably am. Sorry.
