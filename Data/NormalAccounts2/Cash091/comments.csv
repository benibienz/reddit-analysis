121,"I have Solar City.  Personally, I love the look of having panels on my roof.  It didn't really cut my bill a whole lot, more like 25%.  Partially because I only have 8 panels, and I only use about 300kWh/mo anyway.  I would have gone for it even if it were 10% or less simply because having a smaller impact on the environment *is* important to me.  I don't want to get on the high-horse about going green... if you don't want to, that's fine.  Personally, I want the world to be decent for my kids and grand kids.

In regards to solar tech improving.  The salesman that came to my house straight up told me that solar tech is always getting better.  He said the only real risk in going with a contract like this is the panels would surely be outdated by the time the contract was 1/4th the way through.  However, you run that risk when you buy **anything** tech related.  You can bet your ass these roof shingles are going to be insanely expensive.  If tech improves enough, I'd gladly pay the termination fees to replace my system.  

Honestly, when it comes to solar in any regards, systems are almost always going to be expensive.  Whether you buy them outright or lease for 20 years, are you really going to want to replace them in a few years when the tech gets better?  In your case, if you *really* want the shingles, then yeah...wait.  For most people, it doesn't matter a whole lot.

The salesman also was straight with me in regards to how much I would save, and that it wouldn't even be a huge benefit to me going solar.  Sucks that you got a bad sales person.",2016-11-04 21:37:01+00:00,d9m3hk5,2.0,t1_d9lz82t,5371.0,geek

**Screen Write** lets you get a full screen cap and edit it. This can be done easily on non-Note phones, and it's not really a feature I use often.

**Smart Select** allows you to select only a portion of the screen.  Again, this can be done with a regular phone by doing a screen cap and cropping, but the SS tool is just quick and easy.  Note 7 users were actually allowed to capture a GIF using this tool as well... which was cool.  I used this feature a lot when messaging friends.  If I wanted to share an image, I could easily capture, edit, and share without having to download an image.  Not having to save google images really comes in handy some times.

**Action Memo** allows me to instantly pop out my stylus and get to writing a note very quickly.  This is by far the most used function of the S Pen for me.  I usually delete notes when I'm done, but right now I have 22 saved for various tickets/projects I'm working on.

I'm going to totally disagree with this.  I never watched CW matches for that.  I guess I'm not a casual fan, but the reason the CW division should be here isn't for crazy high-flying stuff. It is here to give the guys like Kendrick, Alexander, Perkins a place to put on amazing matches.  And they can.  Without the CW title, you end up with an overcrowded US/IC title field.

205,"Can't tell if your comment is another joke or serious, so you get two responses.

1) Don't do either.  Build a new rig with SLI Titans.

2) If your 970 is doing well for you still, i.e. your still gaming in 2d or 1080p, wait.  Check the benchmarks of the 1080 along with a similar CPU to what you have.  I don't really know a ton about the performance of the FX8320, but you don't want to drop $600+ on a 1080 only to learn your CPU is bottleknecking you.

Depending on what you plan on doing with your rig should determine your answer.  If you are going to be gaming on a 1440p/144hz monitor, the 1080 should handle very well for quite some time and be more than a 50% upgrade from the 970.  If you want 4k or VR, I'd wait.  The 1080 can handle it, but a 1180 or 1080Ti would handle it *better*.

Personally, I would love a 1080Ti release.  I game at 4k and VR currently.  The 1080 would be a side-grade for me when it comes to 4k, as the power is roughly the same.  In VR, I would benefit as most VR games only use 1 GPU right now.  But that's not worth it for me because maybe 25-30% of my gaming is in VR and the 980 works fine for now...  I see the 1080Ti as a power boost in 4k gaming and a MAJOR power boost for VR.  

Also, my plans may change dramatically if VR SLI becomes implemented well before any announcements are made for the 1080Ti.  I'm not holding my breath for either.

They are able to negotiate what the hospital gets.  If the hospital is non-profit, they might even go closer to the actual cost of the treatment.

I was straight forward with them.  My service is phenomenal.  I haven't had an issue with connectivity in the almost 2 years I have owned this house and been a subscriber to Comcast.  My Internet is very fast (170+ on a rated 150) and the package I have (Internet, HBO, and 40ish channels for $90/mo) is *very* reasonable for an area with no other competition.

However, I despise them as a company.  Their anti-net neutrality stance is awful.  Imposing data caps is ridiculous.  Blocking access to certain streaming options (HBO Go on Android TV, Food Network App, FX app, and others) is ridiculous.  If there were another company in the area I would pay more for similar services from them than be a Comcast customer.

The guy on the phone filed some complaint with them and I never heard back from Comcast other then random things I get in the mail.

They are upfront (for the most part...aside from early access players) about the frame cap.  It's similar to Early Access, where they are allowing you a playable version of the game, while promising to fix it.

This gives those like myself, who don't like framecaps, the ability to have knowledge ahead of time and wait on buying the game.  There are many gamers out there who *don't* care about frame locking and they can pick up and enjoy the game.  Why wait longer if the game is stable as it is?

385,"Decriminalizing all drugs isn't a good answer.  However the laws we currently have in effect are pretty awful.  

Minimum sentencing most definitely needs to go away.  The only time min sentencing should be involved is if the person caught with drugs are dealers and not an addict.

Help **needs** to be given to those who choose to seek it.  Those seeking help should not be subject to jail time, permanent loss of children if applicable, or even a loss of job(of course this is tough depending on the job).

Those who aren't willing to take help.  That's where we run into issues...  For some reason, people seem to think the answer is as simply as decriminalizing drugs.  As if once drugs aren't something to get you jail time people will suddenly lose interest.  That's not how addiction works.  

That being said, I don't think the answer to those types of people should be jail time.  If anything, there should be separate rehab services for people who aren't willing for it.  Even this is tough, people some may argue holding someone against their will isn't going to help.  You may be right. 

Maybe the answer would be some sort of class they go to a few nights a week first.  If they fail the class or don't go, then they move to rehab(separate from those who choose rehab).  If rehab fails, then jail them (again no min scent).  This way, you have a 1, 2, 3 step process before someone is tossed into some place that isn't helping them, or in some cases, making it worse. 

Most importantly, I think education **is needed**.  We tried with D.A.R.E.  Children need to be shown the negative consequences of drug abuse.  I would say a decent place to start with this education is maybe around 7th or 8th grade.  Maybe even high school.  Starting too young and you risk children not grasping the immense importance.  Starting too old and you risk children simply not caring, or already using.  Dare wasn't perfect, but it worked for me.  Rather than just bash it, why not fix it?

Lastly, the classification of drugs is something that most definitely needs to be adjusted.  There is absolutely **no reason** why marijuana is so strictly regulated. 

I'm not saying I have all the answers, and I'm no policy maker, so I am sure there are flaws in what I posted above... but bickering aside, there is a problem in this country with substance abuse.  Our laws/help system isn't working.  Decriminalization isn't the answer. Neither is stricter laws.  A change is needed.",2016-10-05 15:21:16+00:00,d8f3do6,1.0,t3_55z0wq,13373.0,news

We do have problems with help being easily attainable, and problems with the awful drug laws currently in effect, but what do we do with the people who are suffering from addiction with or without children, and choose *still* not to seek help.

Even if help is readily available.  What do we do with people who won't get help?

Should we mandate they go to rehab instead of prison?  Do we simply take their children away until they get clean?  If we don't mandate anything and the person has no kids, do we let them rot if they choose?

Part of me wants mandated rehab type services.  Part of me wants the person to have the ability to choose.  *All* of me wants them to lose their children until they are clean.  And, if they get the kids back they will be subject to randomized drug tests for a few years.

Think about it.  Someone like me who wants to watch these shows has 3 hours of Wrestling on Monday, 2 hours on Tuesday, then 2 *more* hours on Wednesday!  This week it was 3 hours on Wednesday.  That's 8 hours of wrestling this week!  I have other shows to watch too, video games to play, and a family to spend time with.

On weeks with a PPV, which happen more now we have two shows hosting PPV's, that's ANOTHER 2-3 hours of programming.  If you want to follow another promotion, you can be spending every night of the week watching wrestling.

I think WWE is best to move SmackDown over to Thursday night again.  I'd say Friday, but that would lower SD's ratings as people like to do things on Friday night.  SmackDown started on Thursday's.  Bring it back to it's roots.  

I think if SD moves to Thursday's you'd see a boost in RAW as people wouldn't feel gassed out with too much content.

**Things to order:**

Triple Burger

Nuggets (2 needed)

French Fries (any size, about 1/2 small is used)

McChicken

**Instructions**

**1)** Separate bottom beef patty leaving cheese on top of meat.

**2)** Place McChicken on top of meat patty.

**3)** Separate one more beef patty from burger, place on top of McChicken. Be sure to make sure cheese (or most of cheese) goes with it.

**4)** Place single layer of fries on top of 2nd beef patty. I placed a 2nd layer stacked like Jenga-style over the first layer.

**5)** Place 3rd, and final beef patty over fries.  Again try to get the cheese on top of the patty. 

**6)** Place 2 McNuggets on top of patty

**7)** Place the top bun and rest of toppings on top on McNuggets.  

**8)** Get napkins ready, and HATE YOURSELF for the rest of the day.

**Notes**

For the exact burger pictured, I ordered my Triple as follows:

No ketchup, no mustard, add mac sauce, add shredded lettuce, add tomato, add bacon, extra cheese.  Each change adds a few cents to the order...

Said [right here](http://www.geforce.com/whats-new/articles/nvidia-vr-funhouse-released-download-for-free) from team green themselves.

I just re-launched the game with SLI enabled.  GPU 1 was doing the blunt of the work, while GPU 2 had power flatlined at 40% and usage in the 20% area with quick spikes into 30's and 40's every so often...

Now, not all game may have this steep requirement in the future, but if nVidia themselves can't be flexible enough with their own tech, what hope do I have for other devs to?  SLI currently gets back burner, as does VR for now.

One other thing I found was developers are going to give console users access to modify things in game.  An example was Rise of the Tomb Raider.  You can chose to run the game at a higher resolution (probably something along the lines of 1440p upscaled to 4k), a higher refresh rate (1080p60 which is nice for console), or 1080p30 with more details (Ultra mode or close to it on PC).  I honestly think this is pretty cool.  

Not having the console do UHD Blu-ray would be a huge deal breaker for me.  4K TV's have come down in price significantly.  Unlike the joke in this meme, I bought the 4k KS8000 from Samsung for $1200.

I know we aren't console fanboys here...  but we are fanboys for accurate knowledge.  This console *can* support video playback at 4k60.  In the article they say you need an HDMI 2.0 cable to do so.  (Even though technically, you just need the HDMI 2.0 slot)

I don't know why people are downvoting others for saying this console supports video playback at 4k60.  It does.  The article clearly mentions that.  The only time 4k30 is mentioned as a limitation is when they say if you are using an HDMI 1.4 input or lower.

That being said, I think this console is **insane**.  $399 for a 4k60 video player is ridiculous.  I mean...  the only real benefit is it can finally play games at 1080p60 (hopefully) and not lag.

926,"So, it does show up on your credit report, however it shows as a hard inquiry.  Hard inquiries have the ability to affect your credit, albeit short term as they only last two years, but too many of these (4+ or more within 2 years) can hurt your credit score.  

Also, if you are paying your balance off within 6 months why would you NOT want it on your report?  The only times something not hitting your report is good is if it is derogatory.  

Credit scores are very finicky...  You get ""graded"" on a multitude of different things.  Credit utilization, payment history, deragotory marks, age of history, total accounts, and inquiries.  Credit Utilization is the percentage of your available credit you are currently using.  This is the only section which PayPal *not* reporting would benefit you.  Assuming of course you **don't** pay it off quickly, however because you do utilization is moot.

Having PayPal report to the other sections (aside from Inquiries over 4 as stated above) would do nothing but **benefit** you in the long run.  Even with the amount of accounts you have, higher is better (which IMO contradicts inquiries counting against you... but hey that's FICO!).

If you are using and paying off PayPal regularly, this would normally hit credit age and payment history, which would greatly increase your score.  I.e., your much better off getting a credit card with 6 months no interest, or some promo with points/miles.  Often times you'll get notifications (like my Best Buy CitiCard) where they want you to buy something NOW for 12 months no interest even after the account is open. 

**TL;DR:** PayPal NOT reporting isn't necessarily a good thing.  It's not a bad thing either unless you have 4+ hard pulls within 2 years, or pay late.",2016-07-11 14:53:04+00:00,d57wo92,6.0,t1_d57n761,23895.0,nvidia

989,"You can totally!  I had a 2500K at 4.2Ghz using the EVO212, which is *dirt cheap* compared to what I spent on all my water cooling parts.  Granted, I bought the parts over time so it wasn't so bad...

Advantage to water cooling is I currently have a 4790K @ 4.7Ghz (I fluctuate honestly...  right now it's 4.2 and still decimates all) and two GTX980's between 1400-1500Mhz, which is moderate compared to some watercooling rigs...  Memory on the 980's is clocked to 8000Mhz as well.

Using the NZXT Grid+ V2, I am able to run my fans (5x120mm) at 40-50% of their speed.  The loudest thing you hear while idle is the low hum of the pump.  The fans are essentially silent.  Hell, while idle I can turn the fans completely OFF and still hover around 40C on the CPU (@4.2 on CPU and while idle the GPU's essentially generate no heat).  Cooling simply by moving water throughout the loop.  As, the more water you have, the longer it takes the temp to rise.

[Here is idle mid-June with no AC in the room](http://i.imgur.com/B7K43Kw.jpg). 

While under load, the MSI Gaming 4G cards were hitting 60-65C on the bottom card, and 70-75C on the top card. Currently, I *barely* hit 50C on either GPU!  Most games take a while to hit 45C, and that is with no air conditioning in my room.  

I stressed the 980's with [Battlefield 4 at 4K and my temps](http://i.imgur.com/nIwynQV.png) got to about as high as they go(60fps constant btw;-) ).

TL;DR: Watercooling is quiet and cool.

990,"A NAS (or Network Attached Storage)array is basically a box of hard drives on your network for storage.  

Setting up a NAS array is pretty simply.  You could follow [this guide](http://www.howtogeek.com/208030/how-to-set-up-a-nas-network-attached-storage-drive/) and get one running.

Advantages are you can typically house more drives than a single computer(OP can still house A LOT), you can access the drives from any computer in the house or even over the internet, you can stripe data for speed and redundancy, and most importantly it's separate from your rig for protection.  Protection as in if the rig blows up, the drives and data on them are protected. 

Basically what you need is an [enclosure](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822122151&amp;cm_re=nas-_-22-122-151-_-Product), some [drives](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16822235063), and software.  Since most boards, router/switches, and enclosures now have Gigabit ethernet, you'll likely not run into bandwidth related speed bottlenecks.

It can still be expensive, but when you are building a rig over $5,000 it doesn't seem like money is an issue.  Hell, my rig is worth a bit over 3k, but even I only have a 5TB spanned disk for storage.

Putting that much storage into a single computer isn't recommended right now.  I say right now because as storage gets cheaper, you may find it in the future.  But now, 26TB worth of disk space is pretty pricey.  The NAS drive pretty much avoids ""putting all your eggs in one basket"".

1053,"Looking at the top of your list using Dark Souls as a good view point.  If **they** did what Bethesda did here, **this is how it would look:**

Dark Souls makes a separate product called ""Dark Souls: Steam Controller Edition"" and sells it for $99.99.  New product ID with new box art.  It comes with a Steam controller and the game, but technically, it is it's own product.  Still have the base Dark Souls 3 game and Steam Controller on the market for $59.99 and $49.99 respectively, making the total price of the two individually $109.98.  

Now, Summer Sale comes around, the remove the ""Steam Controller Edition"" from the market.  What is left is the Dark Souls 3 + Steam Controller Bundle.  Together, those items retail for $109.99.  They put them on sale for 32% off leaving the final price  $74.98.

They could have kept the ""Dark Souls 3: Steam Controller Edition"" on the market and discounted it 25%, ending up with the same $74.98 price tag, however **32%** off is a better *perceived* value than **25%** off. 

They are not raising the price of anything, as they are separate items.  Instead, they removed the lower price option which was previously available.

1074,"Recently purchased my first home a few years back, but the last apartment we lived in had some of the worst neighbors around.

First, the guy who lived right next to me was loud and abusive to his girlfriend.  We had to call the cops on more than one occasion.  He never bothered us though and assumed it was the old guy who lived directly below us that called...  He was just as bad though.

When we first moved in he told us stories about the lady who lived there before us.  He claimed she would slam things onto the ground on purpose to bother him.  I told him we were quiet people and he wouldn't have to worry about that with us.  He thought differently though.

After a few months he asked us, ""Can you stop walking like animals up there already?!""  It was very rude, and I simply apologized.  I told him we don't wear shoes in the house and it doesn't sound loud.  After a week or so I get a call from the landlord.  I guess he complained and said I was rude to him when he confronted me.  He also now claimed *we* dropped things on purpose...

A few months go by, it was around January.  I get another call from the landlord.  This time he was complaining about us having kids over ""all the time"" and they are bouncing around on the floor.  We had kids over our house *once* during the 3 months prior...  **Christmas morning!**  This dude complained about kids being rambunctious on *Christmas morning!*

Last complaint he had with us was when my wife's sister and her family came from out of state to visit us.  They have 3 small, yet crazy children.  They came to our apartment one night that week for dinner.  The next morning I found a newspaper article clipping of a woman who was arrested for ""harassing"" her downstairs neighbor.  

When I confronted him about it he claimed he was pressing charges against us and he called me and my wife terrorists.  He said he ""trained"" my wife to walk quietly up the stairs (she was pregnant) and needed to train me.  The entire time I was recording the conversation.  You could hear me losing my patience about half way through though...  I sent it to the landlord and told him they should kick this dude out... How many people does he need to complain about before he realizes, ""Hmm...  maybe I'm the problem?""

I didn't really like the guy next to us, but one time the old man yelled at him in the hallway.  That dude flew down the stairs and got in his face so quick...  I thought I was about to witness a freakin murder!  Abusive guy had just broken up with his 2nd girlfriend, so he was already pissed off.

1238,"Best chicken parm I ever had was at El Tepame.  

They did it a little different though.  Instead of cheese on top of a chicken filet, they diced the chicken and mixed the cheese in. Also, spaghetti was subbed out for rice, which is very interesting but delicious! The tomato sauce was different too.  They used these green things that looked like tomatoes with a big seed in it.  Mushed that up and mixed it in.  Best tomato sauce I ever had!  Normally, I top with graded cheese, but they used this liquid style.  It was a bit sour, but I got used to it.  Finally, the most interesting change was the plate they used.  This giant round plate that basically folded up to hold my chicken parm together.  It was *actually edible* which was the strangest thing!!!

$200 is decent performance, however it is still low end in regards to PC gaming.  Low end these days *still* gets you 1080P 60fps in most things.

Starting at $250 and up to $500. With the high end cards like FuryX, RadeonX2's, Ti's, and Titans for people wanting to drop $600+.

Grab a lid for the pan. I use a lid that sits inside because it doesn't fit perfectly, but it doesn't need to. As long as it is heat safe, mine is metal and glass.

Heat 1 Tbsp oil in pan on medium/medium high heat for 3 minutes.

Crack eggs into a bowl. This allows for dropping the eggs in all at once since they cook FAST!

Add 1 Tbsp butter, it shouldn't brown super fast, but should melt and start browning slowly.

Add the eggs to the pan and cover. Cook for 45 seconds. 

Remove from heat and cook for 3 minutes. 

End result is a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg! White fluffy center, with a nice browned edge and bottom. Yolk is perfect for toast or English Muffins.

I would beg to differ.  I stream PC games from my PC to living room TV, which is on another floor. Using the nVidia Shield and DSR I'll stream a 1440p signal to my TV.  I have a decent AC router and a wired connection was still better than wireless.

Streaming media isn't an issue, but when I'm gaming at high resolutions and 60 fps, I don't like connection issues.

1396,"This build is okay.  Things I would try to cut are:

**CPU cooler:** The stock Intel cooler is fine.  Unless you are overclocking (this particular CPU shouldn't be overclocked), the heat generated by the CPU won't need anything more than the stock cooler.

**DVD Drive:** Almost useless. If you have a computer available now, you can load Windows 10 onto a USB drive and install from there.  Pretty much any game you buy for PC these days is digital.  Unless you have things you specifically need an optical drive for(i.e. older disc game or if your son wants to watch DVD's), skip it.

**Wireless Card:** With any desktop computer, if you *can* connect via an ethernet cable, do it.  If this is the only desktop in the house, I suggest placing the modem/router there.  Only use wireless if there is literally no other option.

This frees up about $70 which could either go towards a better graphics card like the GTX970/1070 or an r9 380, or even a decent solid state drive.  I recommend a solid state drive, as that is going to make the computer faster in basic operation.  A Samsung EVO 256GB drive will allow the computer to boot up in less than 15 seconds.

I remember my relatives being slightly annoyed with him for making me do this, as I ""didn't know any better.""  Even though I was young, I remember being fully aware it was the booze that was killing him.  Knowing full well another beer wasn't going to help anything, but also knowing full well that another beer wasn't going to make matters worse.  He wasn't going to suddenly recover if he had given up drinking then and there.  He was **going to die**, why not let him indulge in these last moments?

Letting the chicken soak in the buttermilk overnight supposedly makes a difference...  although I haven't tested otherwise.  Also, as  someone said below, letting the flour dry up a bit before hitting the oil/shortening is a **must**.  It's a fine line though.  You don't want it turning to cement on you.  

Also, with shortening, you don't want to go over 350 at all.  It will start to smoke and give you a bad flavor.  According to the recipe, they say not to go over 325, but I assume that's to give you some wiggle room on the temp.  Good rule of thumb I guess...

Anyway, [the chicken](http://i.imgur.com/dTFwHMY.jpg) I made came out nice and crispy.  Delicious too!  BTW, if you do make this recipe exact, don't salt the chicken when you are done.  It might be too salty for you.",2016-05-14 01:46:22+00:00,d34t69e,1.0,t3_4j75r4,33067.0,castiron

In the late 90's (Attitude Era) he was with his brother Jeff as a tag team known as ""The Hardy Boyz"" (everything was ""Z"" back in the 90's...  

When the tag split he started doing ""Matt Hardy: Version 1"" or V1.  During his intro, they would display ""Matt Facts"" on the titantron.  

I don't know if they are currently doing this in the TNA promotions, because he is prominent in their events.  But it was a thing back when he was in WWE.

In the article they have other articles near the top. The first one and the bottom two are good reads if you're looking at learning *why* it's cooked the way it is. 

They use the low and slow method first, then sear it with the oven after. They tested searing first, high oven then residual heat, and this method. This method caused the roast to lose the least weight, meaning more juice in your roast. 

Also, the tip of salting the night before and letting it rest in the fridge **uncovered** is **NOT** optional. They tell you it is, but trust me. The crust of the roast is my favorite part and at my house there are fights over the end pieces. You only salt the night before though, not twice.

1580,"It shouldn't be too bad, if you do it right.  You basically want to make sure your tubing isn't too big for your fittings, which is easy to do.  More importantly, you want to make sure the threading of your fittings matches the blocks.  Everything I have is G1/4 thread.

In regards to re-positioning tubes.  From what I can tell, the positioning of the in and out ports on the blocks don't change much.  They usually position the ins and out on the block a little ways down from the SLI/Xfire thumb.  I have soft tubing, but everything is pretty tight.  If the in/out on a later card was further down, I would just run 2 new tubes to the GPU. But I doubt something like that would happen.  

This is the first GPU setup I have done on liquid.  Before I did this, I had a custom loop on the CPU with one radiator.  When I got the blocks for the 980's, I had to basically redo the entire loop.  However, there are a few things to note:  

**1)** I needed a different case, as the first loop I did was in the NZXT Phantom case, which only has support for a 240mm radiator.  I could have mounted a rad on the outside, but I wanted everything neatly packed inside my case.

**2)** I didn't install a drain port. Because the CPU loop was the first custom loop I was doing, I bought a kit with everything I needed.  My loop now has a drain port at the lowest point, next to my pump.  Before, to drain the loop I needed to take everything out and open it up.  Now, I'll tilt my case, remove the cap, and turn a nozzle. You can even spend a few more dollars and put a hose on the drain port.  I was thinking about it, but it would have been harder to hide.

Still, upgrading isn't as easy as simply removing a card and installing a new one.  If you re-sell, you need to keep the air cooler and heatsink if you have a full block like I do.  I keep my boxes, so it's fine for me.

The hassle comes with draining the loop, installing new water blocks (which was pretty scary the first time), filling the loop, 24 hour leak test, and air bleeding.  It's especially scary because with every step in the instructions is wording like, ""DON'T DO THIS/DO IT THIS WAY OTHERWISE YOU WILL BREAK YOUR GPU AND/OR WATERBLOCK!""   My favorite was, ""Don't apply too much pressure, GPU dies are known to crack.""  Wut?

Why would he go through the trouble of folding the paper so carefully, then write the logo off center?  Why are there seemingly two folds?  

If you look at the image ShadowFluffy has and tilt your head 90° to the left, the middle fold puts a second line through the logo, almost splitting it into 6 sections, like the folds.  

Also, it could be possible the line break in the circle of the logo means something.  If there are 4 or 6 sections, ShadowFluffy's idea of working in a circle starting not with section 1, but section 2.  It might be hard, but finding which end of the circle is on top could help you figure out which direction the circle was drawn, then move through the quadrants (or sections if there are 6) in that direction.

Having a 512GB for system drive is a waste of $150 IMO.  Unless you have large apps which would benefit from the speed, 256GB is more than enough for the foreseeable future.  Get a 4TB for games and you'll be good to go.  Or two 2TB and stirpe them.

1735,"Quick story:

I had GTX 460's in SLI.  Wanted an upgrade as 1GB VRAM was aging fast.  I was looking at the performance of the 660TI's (always loved SLI configs) with envy.  I knew there was the 192-bit   memory bus and the 7 series was right around the corner.  Basically, where we are now with the 10 series.  

I thought, ""Waiting is stupid.  If I wait for the next one, I'll always be waiting.  That's what everyone always says anyways...""  

So, I bought the 660Ti.  Well...  3-4 weeks later, the 760 came out.  It was basically the 660Ti without the gimped 192-bit bus.  Also, the gimped bus meant the 660Ti had a similar memory buffer to the 970, with the last 0.5GB being significantly slower.  Oh!  It was also $50 cheaper than the cards I just bought.  In hindsight... I should have returned the cards and got new 760's...  but I didn't feel like doing RMA's and lived with my mistake.  

**TL;DR**

Normally, I'd say waiting is pointless.  *However*, since the launch is **literally** around the corner, WAIT!  Worst case scenario, you get a 9 series card on the cheap...

DX12 is supposed to utilize the buffer of both cards.  Effectively giving *you* 12GB of VRAM.

Makes sense. With 2 970's in DX11 I was able to max the game @ 1440p.  Minus the VH textures of course.  With the one 980Ti being *slightly* less powerful, but pretty much on par with 2 970's, you should be able to max the game without issues on 1 card.

You may eventually.  Problem is, have you gone over 4GB?  Because on my 980's, I hit 4GB and the game crawls to a stop.  The reason why I said need at least 6GB is because they don't make a 4.5GB-5.5GB card.

This isn't true at all.  Look at Rise of the Tomb Raider.  To run very high textures you need at least 6GB VRAM.

It is a fantastic card and I would say it will most likely handle 1080p gaming on max though the 10xx generation.  The only thing you may have to dial down is anti-aliasing, *possibly* ambient occlusion (VXAO would be a stretch).  

In Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12 I was getting 55fps average (4790k @ 4.2Ghz).  I had everything maxed except for textures which were on high.

The 10xx are rumored to be big improvements but you have to realize, the big ""enthusiast"" push is 4k and VR.  The heavy hitting cards are going to be engineered with this in mind.  This means they will OBVIOUSLY crush anything @ 1080P, but it will be OVERKILL.  If you plan on going 4k or VR with your next card, wait.  If not, the 970 will be more than enough.

Personally, it worries me. When I first got a rift dk2, I had 2 GTX660tis. I was showing some people a few games and didn't realize I only had one card active. It was a bit stuttery.  When I explained why, they sort of glossed over as they aren't tech people, they are console gamers. Anyway, I tried to get them to play a game at a later date, on 2 970's instead. They didn't want to even try because last time it made them sick. 

If we are going to have VR on a console in the mainstream, it **needs to be perfect**. Many console gamers will expect it to be since the device, along with peripherals needed will be more than they paid for the console. We all know how much console players love to talk crap about products. All it will take is a handful of early adopters sending it back and complaining on YouTube to put a major hindrance in the future of VR.

If you want to wait that long, I'm sure the upgrade will be **TREMENDOUS!**  Pascal is going to be used in machines for VR, which need a lot of overhead power.  

Thing is, that 970 is going to be a HUGE upgrade to your 660 (non-ti) I'm assuming.  I came from two 660ti's to two 970's, and the upgrade was SO NOTICEABLE, especially in VR.

2333,"Nope. While Kirito was holding Asuna, Kayaba simply turned it off then to ask her how *she* just broke his game. 

He most likely wasn't going to, but being so interested in human spirit and all, was intrigued by a conversation with her. 

Kirito was down immediately after her death, so he had time.

RECAP:

 Boss 75 Fight - NG ONE

 HC vs. KIRITO - NG ON

 Asuna Breaks Game - NG ON (she's about to die)

 Kirito drops down to Asuna's

 While Kirito is holding her, Kayaba disables the killing blow to Asuna IRL.  Sends her to the clouds.

 HC VS. KIRITO ROUND 2 - NG ON

 HC KILLS KIRITO - NG ON

 Kirito breaks game by not dying. The game doesn't send the killing blow because he isn't dead, even though he's at zero hp. 

KIRITO KILLS HC - NG ON

Kirito's spirit finally gives out knowing the fight is done.  The NG is **now** about to give the killing blow IRL. 10 second count begins.

Kayaba, after HC's death disables that blow and sends Kirito to be with Asuna. They both broke his game and he wants to speak with them now. 

At least, that's my interpretation. Kayaba doesn't need to turn everyone's off. And him being *Kayaba* can switch things at the blink of an eye.

As for Kirito, I don't think he turned his off at all.  Kirito kept going past 0hp out of sheer will power. Kayaba, later talks about the power of the human spirit being enough to break mechanics. ",2016-01-27 01:10:52+00:00,czdac4u,9.0,t1_czd9f5g,1398.0,swordartonline

2420,"I did the math. If I kept my old plan, with 3 smart phones, I spent about $5400.  That's 3, $200 phones (subsidized in the plan) and a $200/mo bill.

Currently, I have a 6GB plan from Verizon.  It's $120/mo and I have two iPhone 5s's and a Note 5.  In two years, it will cost about $4600, saving me almost $1000.  

Granted, this is me.  I use Verizon, with a low data plan and two, somewhat outdated yet still outrageously expensive phones.  

However, because with ANY cell phone, the cost of the service is included one way or another, comparing the cost of a Rift to the cost of a phone is utterly insane.  

I will totally say I think cell phones are ridiculously overpriced!!  However, if I could pay $25/mo for a Rift over two years with NO interest, I might pick that up.  It's still $600, but swinging $25/mo is much easier for someone on a budget than it is dropping $600 on a gaming device.",2016-01-07 04:41:07+00:00,cyozntt,11.0,t1_cyoz21s,1114.0,IAmA

When I paid a higher price for my plan and bought phones at a discounted price, over the course of 2 years, I spend over five grand. (About $230/mo plus $200 for a phone).

Now, I spend about $120 a month and am paying off a $700 phone and two $550 phones.  It's about $4500 over 2 years.  $500 cheaper.",2016-01-07 04:29:47+00:00,cyozaks,11.0,t1_cyoyskz,907.0,IAmA

They no longer do that with the cheaper cell plans.  You either pay the full price of the phone up front ($696 for the Note 5, my phone), or you pay a monthly cost for the phone in your plan($24.83 for 24 months, which is actually $100 less).  

EDIT:  I used to have an Unlimited Data plan with Verizon.  Once I got a phone with a monthly payment, it lowered the cost of the Verizon services, but I had to pay monthly for the phone.  Doing the math, I still saved money. The only way keeping my old plan was saving me money was if I kept the same phone for more than 2 years.  And let's be honest...  I'm not going to do that.",2016-01-07 04:13:40+00:00,cyoyrcv,9.0,t1_cyoy4c5,1135.0,IAmA
2423,"By more affordable, I mean people are more likely to be able to afford a monthly payment of $20-30 as opposed to a solid payment of $600-700.  Especially since if your plan is structured this way, you are *typically* spending less on the bill.

Example: I have a Note 5, one of the most expensive phones on the market.  I pay about $27/mo.  The phone was about $650.  When I switched to this plan, the rate of the plan was cut in half.  Data and minutes went from about $230 to $130.  This cut allowed me to afford the extra $27 for the phone.  I did **not** have the $650 to drop on the phone.

It can be argued that I could have kept my old plan and spent $300 on the phone and be done with it, but even dropping $300 was a bit high.  Especially since my plan was so high before switching.

If I could spend $25/month of the Rift for two years with NO interest, I would totally do it.  Still ends up costing me $600, however it seems WAY more affordable this way.",2016-01-07 04:05:13+00:00,cyoyh51,9.0,t1_cyoy4re,609.0,IAmA

I don't think it's people laughed em off back then, I think it's that they have a much bigger soapbox to voice their opinions.  Look at Elvis for example.  People contested his music all over the place, those people weren't laughed away.

These days, we don't have more people getting offended, we have things like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube widely available for people to shout out their grievances to millions of followers.  This thread right here is great proof of that.  I don't know you, you don't know me, yet my opinions, whether you care to agree with them or not, are echoing through your head right now.

As for this story...  No one in this story wanted the tree taken down because they were offended by it.  They were more afraid someone might get offended.  **Ironically**, I have seen more people becoming offended by the idea of people getting ""offended"" by ""Merry Christmas"" or Christmas decorations being taken down than I have actually seen people get offended by anything Christmas.

The only controversy I have ever seen over this issue is people complaining that you ""can't say Merry Christmas"" to someone.  I worked retail back in 2008 and said Merry Christmas to everyone. Someone told me they were Jewish, I said, ""happy Chawnukka(can't spell it... not Jewish), and she said, ""Thank you."" and went on her merry way.  No offense was taken.

I can't imagine the phone is stable simply standing like that.  I can also assume with two batteries it is pretty heavy.  If it falls, say an animal/kid/wind knocks the table, the phone is landing directly on the pencil in the port.  How much pressure will that long-ass pencil take before the tiny Thunderbolt port snaps off?  Maybe a decent amount.  

Now imagine I leave it on my table and it gets shifted over so the pencil is hanging off the edge a bit.  Now a big heavy art book falls from the bookshelf.  Is it going to handle that kind of momentum?

However, having games exclusive to what is essentially a peripheral of my computer is pretty terrible. 

NVIDIA uses Gameworks and people LOSE THEIR MINDS! That doesn't even lock the game, just graphical features of the game. This IS WORSE!  

Someone made a great point. Imagine is Asus paid money to have games only render on their monitors. Have another monitor? Too bad. Better, imagine if to combat GameWorks, AMD started paying money to make games only render with their cards. 

Saying this is helping the future of VR is insane. People are gonna make VR content because it's the future of gaming. It'd be stupid for developers not to realize this. 

I'm all for competition, but this isn't the way to do it. Compete the way nVidia and AMD, or Intel and AMD do. Make better hardware.  Even if they want to add features the other doesn't support. Like controllers and such. Make HTC build their own guitars. But don't lock the game. That's just stupid. You're gonna sell more games if you open it to anyone who has the hardware. 

It's like the nVidia Shield. While I love the product, I think it's dumb they don't support AMD hardware. I know people who want the box, but don't want an nVidia card.

2719,"While I try to be unbiased, I do tend to favor nVidia for myself. That being said, I have built many systems using AMD and try not to let fanboyism cloud recommendations. 

Still, I need to lean to nVidia for this one. Go to Tom's Hardware and look at their R9 380x review. You'll see them benchmark games at 1080p and 1440p. At 1080p the MSI 970 Gaming outperforms the  PowerColor R9 390 ECS+ in  every benchmark.  I use this as reference because the article isn't trying to sell the 970 OR the 390, which makes me trust the info more.

IF YOU PLAN on gaming at 1440p, get the 390.  However, with 1440p+ I wouldn't recommend EITHER ONE OF these cards. 

One thing to note about nVidia though. They are putting their ""game ready"" drivers behind the GeForce Experience app, which WILL REQUIRE an email address. It is also an app that runs in the background. Some people don't like this. NVidia will still have drivers on the site without the need to log in, the difference is these won't be released as often. Bug fixes, security, and such...  Game ready ones will be released with each major title. 

The GeForce Experience app isn't bad IMO. It applies recommended settings on a lot of games, which is nice. It also will notify of new drivers. I think it can auto install too, but I don't like that so I turn it off. 

**TL; DR** 970 at 1080P, R9 390 (or nothing) at 1440p or higher. Mind the GeForce app though.",2015-11-22 22:07:59+00:00,cx9fs5t,5.0,t1_cx9chtc,4952.0,nvidia

Hell, if you get a nice modular power supply and a graphics card that only uses one 6 or 8 pin cable, you could slap an extra fan on that case and run at decent temps. ",2015-11-22 00:34:39+00:00,cx8ins3,3.0,t1_cx84y8u,24187.0,buildapc
2728,"If you want to play decent games right now, get yourself a gtx 960. It should be fine for a bit in that case with that PSU.

If you want a more beefy graphics card, get GTX 970 or r9 280 (personally, I like nVidia, but I'm not a fanboy, so I could easily recommend AMD depending on sale prices) but get a new PSU to go with it. 

Here's where things get fun! 

You have a killer CPU and now GPU as well. IF you didn't buy a new power supply, you want to do so quickly. I had a cheap PSU running an 8800GTS back in the day. It was a 450W, but the card took less power than the 960. Within a few months smoke was billowing out of the PSU, and I needed a new one. Luckily, it didn't fry anything else.  I recommend buying a modular power supply. This means you can remove cables if you don't need them. Saves on cable management which improves air flow. HIGHLY IMPORTANT if you are putting higher end components in that ASUS case. 

Next, more powerful cards generate more heat. You'll need adequate air flow.  This case may have some room for fans, but it is LACKING in cable management.  I would monitor Temps with MSI afterburner regularly. I recommend a mid tower with cable management. You can find an entry level Corsair if you don't want to spend a bunch or research a lot. They make great cases. 

Now, we upgraded case, gpu, and psu. That CPU is still pretty high end, but the RAM and motherboard are probably pretty basic. I would upgrade ram first then motherboard if you didn't want to do both at the same time.  I recommend this because they probably have basic ddr3 in there. If you bought your own, such as g.skill or corsair, you can get ram with a higher clock speed and lower latency. This would greatly help you if you are gaming. Not all RAM is created equally. One of my biggest gripes with pre builds is they don't tell you what 16gb kit you are buying. 

With the motherboard, upgrading that would allow you to do things like overclock and maybe add in another gpu. Or more hard drives. A better chipset would also help lower the ambient temperature of your case. I put this at the bottom of the priority because I assume you won't OC anything or go with multiple gpus. 

Pm me if you have any questions. I'm always willing to help people ditch prebuilts and not waste money on parts.    ",2015-11-21 17:36:15+00:00,cx84g2l,1.0,t3_3toj10,24059.0,buildapc

2900,"This story is terrible, and that officer DEFINITELY needs to be reprimanded. People are talking prison, but personally, I think that's a bit harsh. Here's why:

I know police have training, I think they need more, but they still have *some*. This officer in particular was trained in first response. *However*, he is still human... and to accidentally shoot a child must have been incredible traumatic for all involved. Note, **I am not condoning or giving excuses** for this officers action! Please don't misunderstand me. IMO, he should be removed from service since he can't cope with the job, clearly.  Or at the very least, re-trained. 

Again, not condoning the officers actions **at all!!** The gun should NOT have been pulled out. Don't they have tasers for this exact reason?! I mean, it's a dog! A taser seems like it would have done the job just fine.  

Also, does it mention anywhere if he killed the dog? Because all I can tell is he missed and hit the kid. Meaning, he didn't have to shoot the dog, and he didn't get mauled. 

EDIT:

I mean, in war when trained soldiers shoot children(or anyone for that matter), it messes the mind up.  In cases like this, where it was CLEARLY unintentional, prison isn't the answer. Police reform is. Better training and better selection. ",2015-10-10 14:34:56+00:00,cvusejs,1.0,t3_3o6b9a,44338.0,news

3174,"They are really on to something with the way they had the story mode set up in 2k15.  As long as they don't do what the trend has been, and start from scratch for 16, we may be good.  I have a laundry list, so here goes:

* There definitely needs to be more options in the story, with different outcomes that **follow you throughout your career**.  Perhaps the option to form a tag team or stable.

* I don't want to lose the IC title, and then have ""we have nothing for you"" for the next 6 months...  Let us have an interesting title reign, with different options throughout.

* Throw in some feuds that don't have to be for a title.  Not everyone on the roster is going towards a title all the time.

* During a feud, you should be able to decide what you want to do.  I.e., go over clean or cheat to win.  If you cheat and win a title, you can try to have interference be set up to have you keep your title.

* You shouldn't have to defend the title week after week like 2k15.  This isn't realistic at all.

* Don't have a set ending to the story.  It can go on for years.  Create a WrestleMania venue without a number, that way we don't repeat WM32 over and over.

* Let us decide when a CAW is to retire.  After a few years, a ""RETIRE"" option shows up, this will trigger a retire story-line that lasts a few months, or ends at Mania.

* Bring back ALL the match types!!!  2k15 was so stripped, it was unbearable.  

* May be tough on the consoles, but allow 8 players in a match.  I don't even care if the poly count gets slightly lowered, 8 player matches would be awesome!

Anyway...  I have been playing these games since I was a kid.  Like, WarZone days on the PS1.  I have yet to find the PERFECT game, and everytime one gets close, it gets scrapped and a reboot takes over.  2k15 is pretty decent... just needs some polish.

I had a cookout a few weeks ago, and someone brought a vegetarian to my house.  

...the nerve...I know...

Anyway, she asked me to put some veggie burgers on for her.  Had a pack of four.  I made her apologize to my grill for the atrocity it was about to withstand, which she did, so I put two on.  She ended up leaving the two left over patties in my fridge.  (No I didn't make her apologize to my fridge...the fridge has seen some shit...)

Later that night a few stragglers were hungry again, so I decided to make some more burgers.  That's when I saw them...  I was about to throw them out when one of my friends suggested using them as toppings to my delicious all beef patties.  I was intrigued.  I mean, we put veggies on burgers all the time right?  Lettuce, tomato, peppers, ect...  This might be okay.

Well...  IT WAS!  It added an amazing flavor to the burger and I was very pleasantly surprised!  I don't think I would ever bring myself to buy them at the store, but I might invite some more vegetarians over for dinner!

**TL;DR**

Veggie burgers suck as they are, but as burger toppings, they aren't half bad!

3213,"I love cooking burgers and think I may have some key tips to add.

I prefer the double patty over the thick burgers, and here is why.  You end up with 4 layers of crust as opposed to 2, and you can stick some cheese in between the patties, giving you that stuffed burger effect without having to worry about a cheese explosion upon biting into it.

 I don't like to mix seasoning into my meat.  I only salt the burger when I am putting it to the heat.  Salt side A, place side A down on the heat.  Season side B just before flipping.  It is a good idea to do this because salt breaks down the fibers in the meat with could (maybe not always) lead to a flat burger.

Burger to bun ratio is **very** important.  Lately, I have been using a toasted kaiser roll.  It has a nice crusty outside similar to sour dough, with a soft flaky inside similar to white bread.  IMO, it has the best of both worlds.  Use which ever bread you prefer, but it needs to be able to with stand the weight of the burger.  Those cheap generic buns are only good for less than 1/4lb patties.. anything else and your toast...

TOPPINGS AND SAUCE!  Try some different variations out by mixing BBQ sauce or ketchup with some salad dressing.  One sauce I used for a while was 1T ketchup, 1T mayo, 1t balsamic vinagrette, and 1/2t some Worcestershire sauce.  You end up with enough for a few burgers.
