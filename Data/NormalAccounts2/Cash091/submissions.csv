When Slater was on his own he was getting decimated the ENTIRE. TIME.  It was only once he paired with Rhyno did they find success and win the titles, and hence, a contract.  Looking at the finishes to those matches though, it appears Rhyno was the one who finished it off.  Rhyno saved Slater, Rhyno hit The Gore, and Rhyno scored 2 of 3 pinfalls.

What I see happening is Slater being pinned for losing the titles, Rhyno goring him (again), and Slater vs Rhyno at some future PPV where Slater finally gets a clean win on his own. 

I think using this story, with the constant failure, boost from Rhyno, run with tag titles, then clean win over Rhyno could boost Slater into a possible run for something like the IC title.  He is SUPER over right now and continuing the story would do nothing but increase his babyface status.

I'd be down for a Slater IC title run.

My devices are as follows:

Shield Android TV

Samsung  KS8000 SUHD TV

Pioneer Elite VSX-44 Receiver

I have the Shield connected to the TV via HDMI into port 1. The TV is connected to the receiver via HDMI in port 4. Port 4 on the TV supports ARC, if that makes a difference. 

Currently, I cannot get Dolby Digital to play from the Shield. I hear Netflix uses Dolby Digital Plus, which requires EAC3 passthrough. This is something all of my devices support. I have a Smart BD player, and Comcast Cable box connected the same way as the Shield and they both get DD through to the receiver.

At first, I thought it may be a bandwidth thing as the Shield is set to 4k and HDMI UHD, but then I went and got two HDMI 2.0 cables, and still the same result. Also, I removed the HDMI cable running from the TV to receiver and replaced it with an optical cable. No DD there either, although I hear DD+ requires HDMI, so I took the optical cable out. 

I have HDMI CEC turned on for all devices, Surround Sound Pass through on the shield is enabled. On the receiver, HDMI Control is on, ARC is on, and pass through is set to LAST. 

Where as all the other devices are set the same and using DD+, including the TV'S native app, I think the problem lies with the Shield. I am working with Nvidia, but they are really only suggesting things that I suggest first. HDMI 2.0 and what not... They recently requested I factory reset the Shield, but I'm hesitant... I could use the TV'S app, but 5.1 on the shield is also for gaming, so I want to use it. 

Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.

Marty is constantly bullied by that skater punk Needles. In the 2015 represented by Back to the Future 2, they both work for Japanese Tech Conglomerate, CUSCO.

This gets him, and his fellow skater cronies to the top of CUSCO, while Marty is stuck living in the dumps.

Being in charge of the American branch of CUSCO, Needles and his punk friends basically run everything from marketing to R&amp;D. One of their biggest achievements was the CUSCO Hover board technology, which was sold to companies like Matel and other skating companies.

However, once back in 1985, Marty chose not to race Needles. He didn't crash into the Rolls-Royce, he didn't destroy is rock career, and Needles no longer had control over Marty. Because of this, Needles and his group of degenerates were able to run rampant in the business world and CUSCO never formed. Therefore, R&amp;D and production of hover boards never happened.

This tech may have also led to the advancement of flying cars as well. No one can know for certain. There is only one thing we do know. The future hasn't been written yet!

Do you guys think they are going to do the same thing with Rollins and the WWE World Heavy Weight  Title?  Punk is holding the record for longest running WWE Champion in over 10 years.  Rollins has held the title since Mania, and I **DON'T** see him dropping the title to Kane, or a cash in from Seamus.  

I guess they could refocus the ""record"" by saying the title Punk held isn't the title in contention now...  What do you guys think?",SquaredCircle,"Seth Rollins to take the ""record"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/3orogt/seth_rollins_to_take_the_record/
