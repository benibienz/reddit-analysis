My mom used to have fits at night, then bring me presents during school the next day as an apology, but they were incredibly embarrassing.

When I was in 2nd grade, I can't recall what set her off but she kept calling me a bitch. The next day, while I was in school, she brought me a huge gift basket and checked me out to treat me to a haircut... She cut all my hair off and I was mistaken for a boy for a month or so.

In 7th grade, I was about 15 pounds overweight. The night before she had smashed my dinner against the wall, telling me I shouldn't be eating (she was drunk). The next day I got a delivery during gym class, and she bought me a huge sack of lunch that could feed a family. Which I did, gave it all away because even my gym teacher commented on it and I couldn't eat it without looking like a glutton.

I became bulimic and she was surprised. Her method of treatment was to blackmail me, she was so sorry I felt the need to throw up my food that everyone of our family or my friends had to know about it, the smirk on her face showed so much concern.",raisedbynarcissists,DOE NParent apologize just to humiliate you?,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/58mai7/doe_nparent_apologize_just_to_humiliate_you/

I've never quit without notice but I'm so done with the way she treats us. She's like the mom that grounds you if you bring home an A instead of an A+. I just want to list everything I fucking hate about this place.

Making us pay for mistakes or walk outs.  Tried to make me pay $30 fee for my paycheck they lost. Passive aggressive notes covering the walls and being scolded in front of customers and coworkers. Shoving politics and elections down our throat and asking us to go door to door to campaign for her husband (not required of course but your hours will suffer). Encouragement of bad service to a couple with a Hillary bumper sticker. Ridiculous amounts of side work and responsibility. No POS.

Well, one refused, the others just simply couldn't bring themselves to send it even after I contacted them numerous times. I always have to get the DOL involved to finally get it, and once the DOL contacts them, they are super eager to send it to me lol.

I just don't get why I have to fight for it every fucking time. I've never had a problem from any job except restaurants... Now that I think about it, McDonald's never sent me my last check in college either. Do they just think we are stupid and don't know our rights?
